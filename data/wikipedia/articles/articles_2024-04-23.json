        "revision_id": 1221321015,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Internalized ableism is a phenomenon where disabled individuals absorb and enact negative beliefs and prejudiced values about disability that are prevalent in society. Internalized ableism is a form of discrimination against oneself and others with disabilities, rooted in the view that disability is a source of shame, should be concealed, or warrants refusal of support or accessibility. This internal conflict can stem from continuous exposure to negative social attitudes and a lack of adequate support for disabled people's needs, which contributes to a cycle of rejecting their identity to align with ableist \"norms.\" Ableism encompasses more than just ignorance around disability leading to negative attitudes towards disabled people; it also includes unrealistic ideals of perfection and ingrained beliefs about bodies, promoting the idea that disability is inherently negative or unwanted.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis concept of internalized ableism has historical roots that can be traced back to societal structures that prioritize able-bodied norms and often marginalize or stigmatize those who do not conform. As societal awareness of disability rights has grown, particularly since the rise of the disability rights movement in the 1970s, there has been increasing recognition of internalized ableism as a significant barrier to the well-being and self-esteem of individuals with disabilities. Research into internalized ableism has been informed by broader theories in psychology and social justice, which emphasize the internalization of societal values by marginalized groups.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nInternalized ableism begins early, with societal perceptions often framing having a disabled child as a tragedy. In a study, participants reported encounters where doctors emphasized impairments over potential, contributing to feelings of vulnerability and exclusion. Despite parental efforts to counter stereotypes, inadequate expectations persisted, hindering the development of disabled children. Intersectional biases compounded these experiences, with factors such as gender and social status exacerbating feelings of otherness. The pervasive tragedy discourse continued to shape participants' sense of self throughout adolescence and adulthood, with some explicitly identifying internalized ableism as a significant barrier to their well-being.\n\n\n== Campbell's framework ==\n\nFiona K. Campbell outlines two components of internalized ableism: distancing oneself from the disabled community and the emulation of ableist norms. These \"tactics of dispersal\" can hinder the formation of a shared identity among disabled individuals, weakening what otherwise could provide a sense of unity, and intensifying feelings of isolation. Emulating ableist norms, or \"passing,\" often serves as a survival mechanism for people with disabilities, but can lead to a denial of one's true identity and reinforce the internalization of ableist attitudes. Campbell's work emphasizes the harm that can emerge when a minority group is forced to adopt an identity that does not resonate with them or their internal values. Another author, Sara Ahmed, echoes Campbell's sentiments, writing that anyone who does not fit within a societal norm, whether due to race, disability, or gender, they are forced to settle within the current culture or defend themselves against criticism by adopting characteristics that are deemed more \"normal.\"\n\n\n== As a form of oppression ==\nInternalized ableism is a form of internalized oppression. Internalized ableism arises in response to external oppression, where individuals may develop negative feelings towards themselves and others in their group, often attributing blame to themselves. Traditionally, internalized oppression is framed as a static, psychological issue rather than a dynamic issue that is derived from systemic consequences of generations of marginalization. Internalized oppression occurs when individuals in marginalized groups undervalue themselves, perpetuating this mindset through generations and socialization. Internalized oppression in turn leads to normalized exclusion, which is the acceptance or normalization of practices, policies, or behaviors that systematically exclude or marginalize certain individuals or groups within a society. Although internalized oppression is not always conscious, it can deeply affect how people see themselves and others within their group. This can lead to internal conflicts within the group and the perpetuation of microaggressions, which are subtle forms of discrimination.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nInternalized ableism manifests in various ways among disabled individuals, significantly impacting their mental and social well-being. Disabled individuals may subconsciously adopt ableist norms that devalue their disabilities and themselves, leading to self-devaluation where they view themselves and others with disabilities negatively. Social withdrawal is another manifestation, where individuals may isolate themselves from society due to feelings of inadequacy or fear of discrimination, thereby reducing their interactions and support networks crucial for their well-being. Additionally, some individuals may overcompensate by pushing themselves to overcome or hide their disabilities, which can lead to exhaustion, burnout, and physical harm. There is also often a rejection of disability identity, where individuals avoid associating with other disabled people and distance themselves from their disability identity to not be identified with disability.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nInternalized ableism can have effects on individuals' mental and physical health. It can lead to self-blame, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Internalized oppression may contribute to negative mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and feelings of inferiority. In a minority stress model constructed by Ilan Meyer, individuals with intersectional identities facing oppression experienced heightened stress from managing both external stigma and internal feelings of inferiority and rejection, which negatively affected their mental health. Research has shown that internalized stigma in mental illness is linked to lower levels of hope, self-esteem, and social support, and higher symptom severity. Similarly, research has found that disabled individuals face oppression in counseling, experiencing biases, stereotyping, and a lack of understanding from counselors, all of which hinder their self-perception. Disabled people may feel pressure to be independent or to conform to societal standards of \"normalcy,\" exacerbating the stigma and challenges they face. The medical establishment's pathologization of disability further entrenches these issues, with the pathology paradigm reinforcing the notion that disabled individuals must aspire to able-bodied standards. Social determinants of health and power dynamics further shape the experiences and identities of disabled young people, as external shame is reinforced and internalized.\nAdditionally, shame is a significant aspect of internalized ableism, and affects the health and well-being of individuals with disabilities. This feeling of shame arises from feelings of alienation and defeat, influencing behavior and interactions with the world. Shame is closely associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, triggered by perceptions of inferior treatment or threats to identity integrity. \"Core shame identity,\" characterized by a pervasive fear of exposure as deficient and flawed, perpetuates feelings of unworthiness and disconnection. This internalization of shame within the personality can exacerbate depression and social withdrawal. Overcoming internalized shame requires acceptance and support from others.  Peer acceptance, open sharing of feelings, and nurturing relationships can alleviate shame, fostering emotional well-being and empowerment within the disabled community. Strategies to overcome internalized shame associated with disabilities include participation in peer support groups, seeking therapy, engaging in education and advocacy, practicing self-care, learning assertiveness skills, fostering supportive relationships, and seeking peer mentorship.\n\n\n=== Social ===\nThe emphasis placed by the dominant culture on ability and \"normalcy\" contributes to the perpetuation of internalized ableism, as it establishes unrealistic standards that affect both disabled and able-bodied individuals. Disabled individuals who require care or accommodations are often marginalized, reflecting a societal devaluation of their needs and humanity. Resistance to internalized ableism involves recognizing and affirming the inherent worth of disabled individuals, fostering solidarity, and advocating for systemic changes that affirm disability as an aspect of human diversity.  Examples of resisting internalized ableism include embracing one's disability identity, challenging stereotypes through activism and education, advocating for accessibility and accommodations, participating in supportive communities, and promoting dialogue about ableist language and behavior. This resistance involves both individual actions, such as self-care and self-advocacy, and collective efforts to promote equality and inclusion for disabled individuals. Additionally, institutions systematically address internalized ableism by taking action such as promoting accessibility in public spaces, implementing inclusive hiring practices, and supporting legislation that protects the rights of disabled individuals.\n\n\n== Affective solidarity ==\nThe concept of \"affective solidarity\" underscores the transformative potential arising from the dissonance between one's self-perception and societal judgments. This dissonance, encompassing emotions such as anger and shame, can spark a desire for justice and transformation. Despite challenges, including limited opportunities for collective identity among disabled individuals, solidarity within marginalized communities, as described, is a potent force in challenging internalized oppression. The term \"disability justice,\" originating from the Disability Justice Collective, emphasizes this intersectional framework prioritizing the needs of marginalized groups within the disability rights movement. This approach recognizes the significance of care webs and solidarity among disabled and sick individuals, serving as a refuge for healing internalized oppression and ableism. Both individual empowerment and systemic change is important to combat internalized ableism.\n\n\n== Overcoming ==\nResistance to internalized ableism hinges on access to safer spaces, characterized by solidarity and support. These spaces, often fluid in nature, are deemed \"safer\" rather than \"safe,\" as they can swiftly become unsafe due to various factors such as access issues, ableism, micro-aggressions, or violence. In a study, participants expressed the relief of letting go of their defensive walls on rare occasions, highlighting the constant vigilance required to navigate ableist encounters.\nFamily support plays a pivotal role in resisting internalized ableism, with some experiencing empowerment and advocacy from relatives. However, not all families provide such support, as seen in instances of belittlement and ableist aggression. The importance of supportive environments extends beyond the family, as exemplified by positive experiences in summer camps for disabled individuals.\nAccess to spaces where disabled individuals feel welcomed, understood, and supported is crucial for fostering solidarity and resisting internalized ableism. Peer support and shared experiences contribute to a sense of belonging and empowerment, ultimately countering internalized ableism and facilitating healing.\n\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\n\nSome critics question the concept's oversimplification of the relationship between individual experiences and societal structures. The idea that internalized ableism solely attributes to negative feelings and beliefs may overlook external factors like discrimination and systemic barriers. Additionally, there's debate on whether internalized ableism adequately represents the diversity of disabled experiences and cultural perspectives. Critics also raise concerns about the effectiveness of addressing internalized ableism through individual-focused approaches. They suggest that efforts should also target systemic inequalities and promote social inclusion rather than solely focusing on changing individual attitudes. Moreover, there's worry that interventions may inadvertently reinforce stereotypes or stigmatize certain disability experiences. Furthermore, there's discussion about unintended consequences, such as potential victim-blaming and overlooking intersections between disability and other forms of oppression like racism or sexism.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marla C. Geha is an American astronomer who specializes in dwarf galaxies, and especially the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. She is a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University, and director of telescope resources for Yale.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nGeha grew up wanting to be an astronaut after seeing the launch of the first Space Shuttle, and shifted her interests to astronomy in high school as a more realistic career path. She majored in applied and engineering physics as an undergraduate at Cornell University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1995. She earned a master's degree in astronomy in 1998 from New Mexico State University, but, dissatisfied with the program, left before completing a Ph.D. After a brief stint at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, she reapplied to graduate schools, and went to the University of California, Santa Cruz for a Ph.D., which she completed in 2003. Her dissertation, Internal dynamics, structure and formation of dwarf elliptical galaxies, was jointly supervised by Puragra (Raja) GuhaThakurta and Roeland van der Marel.\nAfter postdoctoral research as a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at the Carnegie Observatories, and as a Plaskett Postdoctoral Fellow at the NRC Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre and Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Canada, she joined the Yale University faculty as an assistant professor in 2008. She was promoted to associate professor in 2012 and full professor in 2014.\nShe has been director of Yale Telescope Resources since 2012. In 2017, she was given a Howard Hughes Medical Institute professorship, funding a five-year program for science education of military veterans.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nGeha was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2015. She was a keynote speaker at the 2021 meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page at Yale\nGeha Research Group",

        "content": "Salvador Hormeu Gardella (18 September 1894 ‚Äì 28 August 1992) was a Spanish footballer who played as a Forward for some of the earliest Girona clubs and later for FC Barcelona.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nSalvador Hormeu was born on 18 September 1894 in Girona. He played with Sport Empordan√®s de Figueres in its beginnings before becoming an active member of the group that founded the first major football club in his hometown Strong FBC in 1910. He stood out for his technical quality, the speed to recover balls, and a great long-distance shot, playing in midfield and in more advanced positions. He was part of the golden age of Strong, with Francesc Roca, Carles Bellsol√†, and Narciso Callic√≥.\nIn 1914, Hormeu moved to Barcelona to study medicine and joined the ranks of FC Barcelona, where he began playing for the club's second team. He soon became part of the first team squad, thus becoming the first-ever player from the Girona region to play for the club. At the Blaugrana club, he played inside left, forming the left wing next to Paulino Alc√°ntara. In total, he scored 23 goals in 51 games (including friendlies) and won the Catalan Championship in the 1915‚Äì16 season, although he continued to play and referee matches for the Girona club.\nIn 1919, Hormeu played with the Canadenca team. After retiring, he became a medical analyst.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCallic√≥ died in Girona on 28 August 1992, at the age of 97.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFC Barcelona\n\nCatalan championship\nChampions (1): 1915‚Äì16\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Narciso Callic√≥ Tom√†s (16 September 1891 ‚Äì 27 March 1927) was a Spanish footballer and motorsport pioneer in Girona.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nNarciso Callic√≥ was born on 16 September 1891 in Girona, but spent his childhood in Barcelona. He studied at Escola d'Arts i Oficis de Barcelona (Barcelona Arts and Crafts School), being subsidized to broaden his knowledge abroad.\nWhen he returned to his native city, he joined the Girona Sport Club in 1909, at the age of 18, with which he played two matches against Sport Empordan√®s de Figueres. Frustrated with the continuity of that team due to the lack of resources and the effects of the Tragic Week, he left the club in 1910 to join the ranks of the third team of FC Barcelona. Back in Girona to do his military service, he was a center forward for Strong FBC in the 1912‚Äì13 season, a club in which he captured the popular fans with his goals, a strong personality and his physical display alongside other figures younger than him, like Francesc Roca, Carles Bellsol√† and Salvador Hormeu.\nOn 29 June 1922, at the inaugural ceremony of the Vista Alegre sports field, in recognition of his role in the introduction of football to the city, Callic√≥ presented a symbolic token in the form of a mascot to the then UD Girona goalkeeper, Joseph Prats.\n\n\n== Motorsport ==\n\nIn the summer of 1913, Callic√≥ retired from playing football and transferred his sporting passion to motoring. Member of the Royal Motor Club of Catalonia, he belonged to the organizing committee of the first laps in Catalonia, where he participated as a pilot or co-pilot of Buick vehicles. Together with Joaquim Cuatrecases, he won a gold medal in the IV Tour of Catalonia in 1920. Despite his modesty, his prestige was recognized among the sportsmen of that time.\nIn 1914, Callic√≥ achieved through his activity and personal effort the construction of the \"Callic√≥ garage\" with its workshops, one of the most important in Catalonia, which was domiciled in the avenue of Jaume I in Girona. In November 1918, the \"industrial accredited\" Callic√≥ was authorized to establish a public rental car service for tourism.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCallic√≥ died in Girona on 27 March 1927, at the age of 35. In his obituary published two days later on Diario de Gerona, it was stated that Callic√≥ was \"endowed with great intelligence, desire to the test, and enthusiastic about his profession\" and also that he was \"one of the most solid prestige of motoring in our regions\". In the following week, on 9 April, his funeral was held at Santa Susanna del Mercadal de Girona.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "News from the 70s is an album by Anthony Braxton that compiles previously unreleased live tracks recorded during 1971‚Äì1976.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring 1996, Italian musicologist and jazz writer Francesco Martinelli travelled to Wesleyan University at the invitation of Braxton in order to present a lecture on the European improvisation scene. At some point during the visit, Braxton and Martinelli visited Braxton's basement, where they found a cardboard box full of tapes, most of them dating from the 1970s. Martinelli returned to Italy with a dozen of these tapes, from which he selected six tracks for inclusion on a CD. The resulting album, News from the 70s, was released by New Tone Records in 1998, and was initially given away with an issue of Musica Jazz Magazine, after which it was issued commercially by the Felmay label.\nThe album opens with a May 1974 recording from Groningen, the Netherlands, of \"Composition 23E,\" on which Braxton, heard on sopranino saxophone, clarinet, and piccolo, is joined by flugelhornist Kenny Wheeler, double bassist Dave Holland, and percussionist Barry Altschul. Versions of this piece had previously appeared on both Quartet: Live at Moers Festival (Ring, 1976) and the studio recording Five Pieces 1975 (Arista, 1975). Tracks 2 and 5, \"Composition 8C\" and \"Composition 8G,\" are alto saxophone solos recorded in France during 1971; Martinelli noted that they resemble tracks on For Alto (Delmark, 1971).\nTrack 3, \"Composition -1,\" features Braxton on clarinet and Holland on cello, and was recorded at the same May 1972 Town Hall, New York City, concert that yielded Town Hall 1972 (Trio, 1972). On track 4, \"Composition -2,\" Braxton, on alto sax, and Wheeler, on trumpet, are joined by composer Antoine Duhamel on piano and Algerian double bassist Fran√ßois Mechali. This performance dates from a concert at Salle Paul-Fort in Nantes, France, during December 1973. The final track, a rendition of Holland's \"Four Winds,\" a composition originally heard on Conference of the Birds (ECM, 1973), is from an October 1976 concert in Graz, Austria, and features Braxton on alto sax, George Lewis on trombone, Holland on bass, and Altschul on drums.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe editors of AllMusic awarded the album a full 5 stars, and reviewer Steve Loewy stated that it \"features Braxton at the height of his power and makes an indispensable contribution to his discography.\" He wrote: \"Sparks fly throughout, as this collection enthralls with some of the best jazz of the era.\"\nIn a 4-star review, the authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings commented: \"Braxton is immensely engaging on his high-end instruments... Lewis is in powerful, almost tailgating form. Wheeler's flugelhorn work is as intense and thoughtful as ever.\"\nGlenn Astarita of All About Jazz remarked: \"News from the 70s is a welcome surprise and is a must for the Anthony Braxton completist and for those who may be too curious to let this one slip away. The sound quality is okay and holds up well considering that amateurs made the original tapes. Recommended.\"\nWriting for Jazz Word, Ken Waxman noted: \"Braxton's improvising and band leading is emphasized as much as his composing here, and hearing him in contexts ranging from solo to quartet you quickly pick up on the skill, technique and intensity that drew people to him in the first place... this CD... is both musically and historically fascinating.\"\nIn a review for Coda, David Lewis wrote: \"four of these six performances are classics... As 'Four Winds' fades away, I regret that more of the medley was not included... Nevertheless essential.\"\nWriter Todd S. Jenkins called the album \"a spectacular release,\" noting that it is \"filled with surprises and strong moments,\" and commenting: \"each piece is a bright gem.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Four Winds\" composed by Dave Holland. Remaining tracks composed by Anthony Braxton.\n\n\"Composition 23E\" ‚Äì 16:40\n\"Composition 8C\" ‚Äì 8:40\n\"Composition -1\" ‚Äì 14:25\n\"Composition -2\" ‚Äì 11:09\n\"Composition 8G\" ‚Äì 7:59\n\"Four Winds\" ‚Äì 15:42\nTrack 1 was recorded in Groningen, Holland, on May 16 or 17, 1974. Tracks 2 and 5 were recorded in France during 1971. Track 3 was recorded at Town Hall in New York City on May 22, 1972. Track 4 was recorded at Salle Paul-Fort in Nantes, France, on December 7, 1973. Track 6 was recorded in Graz, Austria, during October 1976.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAnthony Braxton ‚Äì alto saxophone, sopranino saxophone, clarinet, piccolo\nKenny Wheeler ‚Äì flugelhorn, trumpet (tracks 1 and 4)\nGeorge Lewis ‚Äì trombone (track 6)\nAntoine Duhamel ‚Äì piano (track 4)\nFran√ßois Mechali ‚Äì double bass (track 4)\nDave Holland ‚Äì double bass, cello (tracks 1, 3, 6)\nBarry Altschul ‚Äì drums, percussion (tracks 1 and 6)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marilyn Rynn was an Irish woman who was murdered at the age of 41 after being attacked on the way home from a work Christmas party in the early hours of 22 December 1995. Her killer was the first in Ireland to be caught using DNA testing.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMarilyn Rynn lived in Blanchardstown and was employed in the civil service with the Department of the Environment.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nOn the night of 21 December 1995, Marilyn Rynn attended a work Christmas party with her colleagues at Shieling Hotel in Raheny. She left the party at 2am and later met with friends for food on O'Connell Street. At around 3am she took the Nitelink bus home from Westmoreland Street.\nAfter disembarking near her home, Rynn took a shortcut home through Tolka Valley Park where she was attacked. She had been raped and strangled.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nMarilyn Rynn was reported missing on St. Stephen's Day after she failed to turn up for Christmas dinner at her parents' home. The initial investigation was hampered by inaccurate witness reports with a witness claiming to have seen her boarding a bus on Friday 22 December and from a friend who claimed to have received a phone call from Rynn on Friday.\nRynn's body was recovered on 7 January 1996, from Tolka Valley Park after a cadaver dog found her during a planned search. Semen was recovered from her body. It had been preserved by the freezing tempatures at the time.\nGarda√≠ investigated a potential link between the murder and the disappearance of Annie McCarrick upon learning that Annie had an acquaintance who had contact with Rynn before her death.\nGarda√≠ took over 2000 statements and 354 blood samples over the course of the investigation.\n\n\n== David Lawler ==\nDavid Lawler originally of Baltinglass, County Wicklow and living in Blanchardstown, was living nearby Rynn at the time of her death. He had also attended a Christmas party on the same night as Rynn. He is first cousins with infamous criminal Larry Murphy and attended school with him.\nDuring house to house inquires following the discovery of Rynn's body, Lawler admitted to being in the area at the time of the crime. He subsequently gave a blood sample in February 1996. The DNA match returned in July 1996 and further tests confirmed this. He was charged with Rynn's murder in August 1996.\nFollowing his arrest, Lawler confessed and said he was overcome by \"sexual and homicidal impulses\". He had been walking home behind Rynn through Tolka Valley Park when he raped and strangled her on \"spontaneous impulse\". Prior to his arrest he had used the internet to research DNA and falsely believed evidence of his crime could not survive the elements and consented to giving a blood sample.\nHe plead guilty at trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n\n== Media ==\nMarilyn Rynn's case was featured on Crimeline in 1996. Her murder was also covered in the true crime books The Making of a Detective by Pat Marry, a Garda who investigated the murder, and Lifers: Ireland's evil killers and how they were caught by Barry Cummins.\n\n\n== References ==",

Erinnerungen der Zeit 1945/47, lit.‚Äâ'Salvation from Captivity: Memories of the Period 1945/47') is a memoir book by the German jurist and political philosopher Carl Schmitt.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSchmitt began to write the book while he was imprisoned by the Allied occupiers in the aftermath of World War II. He was held in an American mass internment camp in 1945‚Äì46 and as a witness and \"possible defendant\" in the prison of the Nuremberg trials in 1947. Schmitt was never formally charged for anything, but was held in isolation and wrote the book as a way to cope with the situation.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nSchmitt used the book to personally reflect on his relationship with Nazi Germany. This reflection is combined with the histories of legal and political concepts such as just war, the right to resist, civil war and sovereignty. Schmitt argued for his own innocence and that he had no obligation to actively oppose the German government.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe book was published by Greven Verlag K√∂ln in 1950. Polity published the English translation by Matthew Hannah in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPolity",

The organisation represents Pentecostal Christians in Nigeria and addresses certain social and religious issues in the country.\n\n\n== History and background ==\nThe Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) was founded in 1985 following the transformative Greater Lagos Crusade organised by Rev Uma Ukpai. This crusade brought together church leaders from different denominations, and paved the way for PFN's inception. This event occurred within the broader context of the Pentecostal movement in Nigeria, which began to gain momentum in the early 1900s. The movement experienced growth and influence within the country.\nIn subsequent decades, new denominations were founded, including the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC), Church of God Mission (COGM) and the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), amongst others.\nBy the 1980s, several other charismatic Pentecostal preachers and churches had emerged. It was during this period of expansion that the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria was established in 1985.\nAmong the founding fathers of the PFN were Uma Ukpai of Uma Ukpai Evangelistic Association, Enoch Adeboye of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Charles Osueke of Assemblies of God Nigeria, Obiorah Ezekiel of Christian Pentecostal Mission International, Elijah Abina of GOFAMINT, Wilson Badejo of Foursquare Gospel Church, Oterai of Gospel Church of Christ, William Kumuyi of Deeper Life Christian Ministries, Daniel Ogunkanmi of Christ Gospel Mission, Benson Idahosa of Church of God Mission INC, Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission, Sam Ukaegbu of Faith Cathedral, and Abraham Oyeniran of Evangelical International Churches.\nThe organisation, composed of Classical Pentecostals, Indigenous Pentecostals and Neo Pentecostals, was inaugurated on 14 November 1986 in Lagos and was incorporated on 12 June 1989.\n\n\n== Structure and governance ==\nThe Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) comprises both national and state levels, each with its own leadership.\nAt the national level, PFN is headed by a Board of Trustees, the National Advisory Council, and the National Executive Council. The National Executive Council consists of the President, national deputy President, national secretary, treasurer, and national auditor.\nThe state chapters are led by a chairman and composed of appointed and elected officers, such as the state directors and province chairmen within the state. PFN also has a women and youth wing.\nPFN comprises church leaders and members from various regions and denominations across Nigeria, which helps in promoting unity and the collective interests of the Pentecostal community. They have regular bi-annual meetings.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe PFN is executively led by the President, currently Francis Wale Oke, who served as the previous deputy President. He was elected for a four-year tenure by the National Advisory Council in March 2021, in Enugu, Nigeria. Alongside the President is the national deputy President, currently Bishop John Praise Daniel, national secretary, currently Dr Cosmas Ilechukwu, treasurer, currently Rev. Sam Aboyeji and national auditor, currently Pastor John Ayodele.\n\n\n=== Past presidents ===\nSince its inception in 1985, the PFN has had several presidents serving different tenure within the organisation. Below is a list of all the presidents of the PFN:\n\n\n== Beliefs and community engagement ==\nThe Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria anchors its beliefs in the core theological doctrines and spiritual practices of the Pentecostal community. The PFN generally adheres to the Bible, as the 'living word'. It believes in the universal sinfulness of mankind and emphasises the teachings of salvation though Jesus Christ and the concept of the triune God. Equally, it also believes in the Lords Supper, which is a ceremonial rite that symbolises taking an emblem of the blood and body of Christ, according to 1 Corinthians 11:23‚Äì29; the baptism of the Holy Spirit with an evidence of tongues as stated in Acts 2:4; the return of Christ and a new heaven and earth after the final judgement of man. Other tenets include water baptism by immersion, holiness and divine healing.\nThe PFN also articulates a Code of Ethics aimed at guiding the conduct of its members. This code encompasses principles such as the sanctity of marriage among believers, Christian modesty in attire, brotherly tolerance, and unity in essential aspects of faith. The PFN opens to Pentecostal churches, organisations, and individuals who align with its doctrinal stance and ethical principles.\nIn addition to its doctrinal stance, PFN participates in community engagement initiatives to address certain societal needs.\nSome of these initiatives include the establishment of a TradeFair programme in South West Nigeria in 2007 to support small businesses, donation of grinding machines, motorcycles and generators for financial empowerment, provision of educational materials in certain schools, and sponsorship of about 200 Christian youths for training and skills acquisition at ISAC (International Skills Acquisition Center) in Nasarawa State in 2021.\nIn 2018, the national youth coordinator of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Rev David Ize-Iyamu launched a Youth Revolution Movement (YRM) to prepare young Nigerians for leadership, governance, and participation in the electoral process. He said that the movement was to inform, educate, lead, and sensitise youths to action and participation in the political value-chain. The organisation also stated that it would engage the Federal Government and other religious and interest groups to find lasting solutions to Nigeria‚Äôs security, political and socio-economic challenges.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPFN Lagos State",

        "content": "The Soap Box Derby is a youth-oriented soap box car racing program which has been running in the United States since 1934. Proclaimed \"the greatest amateur racing event in the world\", the program culminates each July at the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship held at Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio, with winners from their local communities from across the US and abroad travelling to compete.\nSince the Soap Box Derby's creation, numerous kid-built racers have since been retired, most of them probably meeting their demise, but many ending up in the attics, basements and garages of countless American households. Today some of these survivors have been finding their way into public venues like bars and restaurants as decorative examples of Americana, with many more being exhibited in museums honoring Soap Box Derby's heritage as a cherished American institution.\n\n\n== Museums with Soap Box Derby racers ==\nBelow is a list of various museums and historical institutions as well as venues open to the public that have in the past or are currently exhibiting Soap Box Derby racers or adding them to their permanent collections, usually acquired via donation by the cars' original owners.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n=== News ===\n\n\n=== Websites ===",

Macwealth is an author and the originator of One Sound Revival TV -  a broadcast media project that preaches the unity of faith, and integration among Christian believers through non-denominational practices and sermons. His International church, which functions as an arm of Isaiah Wealth Ministries, has its operation across different continents including Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe.\nEarly in 2024, Macwealth made a claim that he saw God physically in person, causing a reaction online.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMacwealth became a financial Advisor and started a financial academy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMacwealth started ministry in 2004. The clergyman claimed he saw Jesus during his final year as a student at the University of Benin, calling him into ministry. He is the founder of Gospel Pillars International Church. Alongside the creation of a gospel TV house, a charity house and writing spiritual books and song, in 2024 he unveiled a mega church facility in Lagos called the Ark of Light for all Nations. The building sits on 8,9000 square meters land with an auditorium that can contain 10,000 worshippers.\nMacwealth was inducted into the Nigerian Books of Record in 2022.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nMacwealth has been involved in various philanthropic initiatives aimed at addressing poverty and assisting marginalized communities in Nigeria. Through The Empowerment Network (TEN) and The Isaiah Wealth Initiative (TIWI), Macwealth focuses on providing humanitarian aid, educational support, healthcare interventions, and financial empowerment opportunities, particularly in the wake of natural disasters. Macwealth has set targets to reduce poverty by a significant margin by 2030, recognizing the pressing need in Nigeria amid economic challenges.\nMacwealth launched a food and emergency bank initiative, Ark of Light Food and Emergency Bank (ALPEB), to provide emergency support, including food supplies, to vulnerable families.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nMacwealth sparked controversy with his claim of surviving a close-range shooting without the bullet penetrating him. According to Macwealth, he was confronted by armed individuals and shot at with an AK-47, but the bullet failed to injure him, dropping to the ground instead.\nHe has made prophetic statements regarding the end times, he predicted a date for imminent rapture. These claims have drawn both support and skepticism.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a member of the Navajo Nation, and currently lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDugi was raised on his family's sheep ranch on Grey Mountain the Navajo Nation in North-Central Arizona. He learned hand-sewing from his grandmothers at an early age. Later in the 7th grade, he took a home economics class where he learned how to use a sewing machine.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nDugi's work is influenced by both his Din√© heritage as well as modernism. His work has been described as expressing \"poetic interpretations of cultural teachings and songs without literally encroaching upon them. His fashion designs are often hand-stitched and hand-beaded, embroidered and embellished with feathers, and often incoporate elements of his silversmithing work.\nIn 2018, Dugi presented his work at Style Fashion Week in New York City, where he \"wowed the crowd\" with his hand-beaded designs that have been described as \"ethereal\".\nDugi has exhibited his work at the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, the Denver Art Museum, the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, the Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising, among other venues. His work was included in the traveling exhibition, Native Fashion Now, organized by the Peabody Essex Museum.\nThe Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian published a catalog in conjunction with his exhibition of the same title, It's in the Details: Kenneth Williams and Orlando Dugi.\nA documentary film titled, Becoming:Orlando Dugi, was directed by Kaela Waldstein. It has been presented in several film festivals, including the Human Rights Film Festival.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nDugi has been recognized for his work with awards from the Heard Museum Guild Art Show, the Cherokee Art Show, and the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, among other honors.\nIn 2018, Dugi was awarded a two-month long residency at the Museum of the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nIn 2022, Dugi was named the Rollin and Mary Ella King Fellow, received a Native American Artist Fellowship from the School for Advanced Research.

        "content": "Matteo Belfiore (born 27 July 1979) is an Italian architect, principal of the international design practice MB-AA Matteo Belfiore Architect and Associates, based in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nMatteo Belfiore, born in Naples in 1979, began his architectural education at the University of Naples Federico II. Having graduated with distinction in 2005, he continued his studies at the same institution, eventually attaining a Ph.D. in Architectural and Urban Design in 2010.\nIn his pursuit of a deeper understanding of urban design principles, Belfiore embarked on a journey to Japan in 2010, assuming the role of a researcher at the Kengo Kuma Lab within the University of Tokyo. This experience proved profoundly enriching, under the tutelage of Kengo Kuma, a great master of contemporary architecture renowned for blending traditional Japanese spaces and aesthetics with the rigor of modernist approaches. This period proved in fact instrumental in shaping Belfiore's architectural philosophy. The culmination of their collaboration materialized in the form of a seminal book titled Patterns and Layering: Japanese Spatial Culture, Nature, and Architecture, which focuses on the dialectic between architectural patterns and layering. Subsequently, the insights of Kengo Kuma himself, as conveyed in the foreword of the publication:\n\nWhen I learned that Salvator Liotta and Matteo Belfiore in my laboratory had launched a study on patterns and layering, I had a premonition of something new and unseen in preexisting research on Japan [... Matteo Belfiore] attempted to create a link between patterns and layering. These two previously detached notions can now be integrated into one methodology mediated by structural concepts that, in my opinion, are the key to this link. Structural analysis of the twentieth century struggled to advance beyond the column and beam structural frame. Analysis today allows us to conceive stable structures through the accumulation of delicate members, which have the capacity to produce a variety of patterns while fulfilling their structural responsibilities.\nFueled by his accumulated expertise, Belfiore has nurtured his critical engagement over the years, often engaging in collaborations with international publications within the field, such as Domus, Area, Compasses and ADF Magazine. From the beginning, his critical engagement has always been closely aligned with a sincere focus on design practice. Opting to establish himself in Japan, Belfiore secured design positions at renowned Japanese international studios, including Nikken Sekkei (2013‚Äì2014) and Richard Bliah Associates (2014‚Äì2017). In recognition of his architectural accomplishments, he was designated as a Testimonial of Italian Design in Tokyo for the Italian Design Day 2022, an international event with internationally showcasing the excellence of Italian design abroad, coordinated by entities including the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ADI, and the Triennale of Milan among others.\n\n\n== MB-AA Matteo Belfiore Architect and Associates ==\nDrawing upon his accumulated expertise, Belfiore established his independent architectural practice in 2017, under the banner of MB-AA Matteo Belfiore Architect and Associates.  His background, combining extensive professional experience with a robust academic scholarship, has led to the development of an inventive design methodology. Central to his approach is the advocacy for \"cultural sustainability\", which entails a deep respect for the cultural and architectural heritage of the project site. This perspective, akin to an anthropological study, seeks to enhance the intrinsic value system rooted in local natural and cultural contexts. Notably, Belfiore's work often engages in dialogue with Japanese architectural traditions, exemplified by the reinterpretation of elements like ranma, shoji or byobu in contemporary projects such as the new MSC Cruises headquarters, Piaggio Group Japan Headquarters, Shinkin Bank, i-Byobu and others. Furthermore, Belfiore's design philosophy underscores innovation, flexibility, and adaptability, promoting the repurposing and revitalization of architectural spaces.\nBelfiore's architectural projects in Japan have earned international recognition. Notable among these is the Casa del Design Italiano at the Embassy of Tokyo (2024). This institution represents the first instance worldwide of a Made in Italy museum housed within an Italian Embassy. The project, developed by Belfiore with the collaboration of the architect   Valentina Cannava, focused on the reconfiguration of existing spaces to accommodate multifunctional needs, such as events, meetings, and public reception, and including several Italian designer furnishings, showcasing Italian design expertise. The displayed objects, among which are several recipients of the Compasso d'Oro award, serve as iconic exemplars of Italian industrial design.\nOther significant projects are Shinkin Central Bank Innovation Hub, emphasizing modularity and flexibility in its design philosophy; the renovation and re-functionalization of the Italian Cultural Institute Tokyo Library by Gae Aulenti, where the fusion between Italian and Japanese cultures generates several functional zones tailored for diverse needs and harmonized through color symbolism; and Cybernet Japan Headquarters, featuring a minimalist design inspired by Japanese dry gardens that integrates flexible and sustainable spaces. Additionally, there are the Piaggio Group Japan Headquarters, the Perfetti Van Melle Japan Headquarters, the MSC Cruises Japan Headquarters Intesa Sanpaolo and Pirelli Japan Headquarters, and the fa√ßade restyling of Marposs Japan Headquarters.\nFinally, Belfiore has made further contributions by creating installations for exhibitions with the support of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These exhibitions include Italia RicicliAMO, which highlights sustainability, circular economy in architecture and the utilization of 'waste' materials in conceiving purposeful design objects, and The Italian Design Archipelago, focusing on the creative and productive processes of Italian design products. As a result of his work on behalf of Italian institutions and his design accomplishments, Belfiore was lastly honored in 2022 with the Order of the Star of Italy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBelfiore, Matteo (2012).

        "content": "Golden Valley Wilderness is a wilderness area located in San Bernardino County, California, near Ridgecrest. It covers 37,786 acres of the Mojave Desert, straddling both the Almond Mountains to the southeast and the Lava Mountains to the northwest in the Golden Valley. Steep canyons of sedimentary rocks line the valley walls, rising as much as 5,000 feet on Dome Mountain. In terms of wildlife, creosote bush scrub dominate the vegetation, while Joshua trees and wildflowers grow intermittently. The area also provides habitat for raptors, Mojave ground squirrels, and desert tortoises.\nThe area is managed by the Bureau of Land Management Ridgecrest Field Office and was established as part of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pra√ßa Onze (English: Eleven Square) is a historic site in the central region of Rio de Janeiro. It is located in the Centro district, on the border with the Cidade Nova district. The original Pra√ßa Onze de Junho (June 11th Square), named after the date of the Battle of Riachuelo, existed until the 1940s. It bordered the streets of Santana (to the east), Marqu√™s de Pombal (to the west), Senador Euz√©bio (to the north) and Visconde de Ita√∫na (to the south). \nOriginally called Largo do Rocio Pequeno, it became one of the most cosmopolitan places in Rio de Janeiro in the early decades of the 20th century, as it housed newly landed immigrant families. The most popular ethnic groups were blacks (mostly from Bahia), followed by Jews of various origins. Portuguese, Spanish and Italians were also numerous.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site was uninhabited until the end of the 18th century, as the land was unsuitable for farming and building due to the marshy nature of the area. After the Portuguese Royal Family arrived in Rio de Janeiro and settled in the Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, the first access roads to the area were built. In 1810, by order of King John VI, the Cidade Nova was created, stretching from Campo de Santana to S√£o Cristov√£o. The area had straight streets and large plots, very different from the central area, which was congested with houses on narrow plots. He also created the Largo do Rocio Pequeno, where the S√£o Diogo Mangrove began.\nDespite being the only commercial square in Cidade Nova, Rocio Pequeno remained abandoned. In 1842, during the Second Reign, a neoclassical fountain designed by Grandjean de Montigny was installed in the center of the area to supply the surrounding houses and establishments. In 1854, with the construction and inauguration of the Gas Factory, the Viscount of Mau√° recognized the need to channel the mangrove swamp, cleaning up the path to Guanabara Bay and providing a waterway system linking the suburbs to the city center. In 1858, he inaugurated the Dom Pedro II Railway, which ran through Cidade Nova, connecting it to several suburbs and the interior of the province. After Brazil's victory in the Battle of Riachuelo, Largo do Rocio Pequeno was renamed after the date of the conflict. At the time, with the decline of the slave system, Pra√ßa Onze de Junho became a popular destination for immigrants, due to the proximity to the port and the varied commerce.\n\n\n=== African cultural presence ===\n\nAfter slavery was abolished, large masses of former slaves settled in the precarious one-bedroom houses that existed in the streets adjacent to the Pra√ßa Onze de Junho. Later, they moved into improvised shacks on the slopes of the hills. One of these settlements was called Morro da Favela by soldiers returning from the Canudos War and originated the name of highly populated urban residential area of weak build quality in Brazil.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Pra√ßa Onze de Junho was the stronghold of the black population of Rio de Janeiro. Samba originated in the region, combining the batucada brought by the blacks from Bahia and the lundu from Rio de Janeiro. One of the important locations for the creation of samba was the house of Tia Ciata, a woman from Bahia who moved to Rio de Janeiro and used to cook snacks. She became famous in the square and her house turned into a meeting place for musicians and local people.  \nThe house of Tia Ciata served as the principal place where African music and rhythms were played in the community. In 1926, due to police harassment, some local composers founded a \"samba school\", a euphemistic name for a recreational association that had no educational aims. The first was Deixa Falar, whose divisions would result in several other schools, such as Est√°cio de S√°, Mangueira and Portela. In 1933, Mayor Pedro Ernesto organized the first official samba school parade in Pra√ßa Onze de Junho, which Mangueira won.  \n\n\n=== Jewish presence ===\nPra√ßa Onze de Junho gathered the largest Jewish concentration in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Jewish immigrants chose the location because the configuration of the houses provided space for stores on the first floor and residences on the upper floors. Hundreds of Jewish establishments, as well as clubs, political groups and synagogues settled in the area.\n\n\n== Construction of Presidente Vargas Avenue ==\nIn the 1930s, Rio de Janeiro City Hall planned modernization works for the region, including the construction of a new road to improve access from the center to the north. Consequently, Pra√ßa Onze de Junho was significantly reduced. According to the project, the blocks between Senador Eus√©bio and Visconde de Ita√∫na streets were to be demolished for the opening of the new Presidente Vargas Avenue. In 1941, demolitions began, displacing hundreds of families and bringing down 525 buildings, including some historic constructions, such as the churches of Saint Peter of the Clerics and Saint Joachim.\n\n\n== References in culture ==\nIn the 1940s, Herivelto Martins and Grande Otelo united and wrote the samba \"Pra√ßa Onze\", which was recorded by Trio de Ouro in 1941 and became a big hit at Carnival the following year, the last to be held at Pra√ßa Onze. In 1944, Quatro Ases e Um Curinga paid homage to Rio de Janeiro in the song \"O Samba n√£o morre\", which also mentions Pra√ßa Onze. In 1965, Chico Anysio and Jo√£o Roberto Kelly composed the song \"Rancho da Pra√ßa Onze\", which portrays the cultural effervescence of the place. The lyrics celebrate the joy and tradition of the carnival ranches of Pra√ßa Onze, highlighting the unity and diversity of the people who gathered to celebrate. The song immortalizes the importance of the place as a stage for the cultural and popular manifestations of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nAfter the construction of Presidente Vargas Avenue, Pra√ßa Onze de Junho shrank in size and became a venue for regular circus shows. In the 1970s, the Pra√ßa Onze metro station opened in the area. Between 1983 and 1986, Governor Leonel Brizola attempted to turn the site into a regularized space for street vendors, but the project failed due to the site's distance from the city center. The current monument to Zumbi dos Palmares stands on land that belonged to the former Pra√ßa Onze de Junho. Today, the site houses the Terreir√£o do Samba, a venue for popular music concerts. The Jewish presence remains close to the square in the traditional commercial area of Sociedade de Amigos das Adjac√™ncias da Rua da Alf√¢ndega (SAARA).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCentral do Brasil\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Seaflower was a sailing ship (likely a fluyt) built in England. It was most notable for helping settle Puritans on the Caribbean Providence Island colony in 1631. Regarded as sister ship to the Mayflower, the Seaflower also transported settlers to the New World, specifically to Jamestown, Virginia, colony in 1621.\n\n\n== First ship ==\nSeaflower frequented Bermuda (then known as the Somers Isles), and some time before 20 March [O.S. 30 March] 1622, the ship was accidentally sunk by a gunpowder explosion in the Cabin.\nIt was carrying supplies for a Virginia relief mission.\n\n\n== Second ship ==\nIn 1629, Privateer Captain Daniel Elfrith (aboard the Robert) scouted the archipelago of \"Santa Calatina\" for riches and as a staging point for Spanish ship plundering. The Earl of Warwick was looking for a new location to build a colony, yielding the setup of Providence Island Company. In c. February 1631, 100 men and boys (mostly Puritans recruited from Essex, England) boarded the Seaflower, sailing from Deptford to Providence Island. Ninety passengers settled the island in c. May 1631, intending to load the ship with exotic plants and produce for profit in London.\nSeaflower returned to London in March, 1632. It was attacked-at-sea by Spanish during the return voyage, with Captain John Tanner and crew narrowly escaping. The ship's cargo was only a small cargo of poor quality tobacco. Later, the Seaflower returned to Providence Island and was loaded again, this time with 1 tonne (1,000 kg) of \"mechoacan potatoes\" (Ipomoea purga) for their medicinal value.\nIn autumn 1676, the Seaflower was still in use as a transport for slaves from Africa to the Caribbean. During and after King Phillip's War, the Seaflower was used to transport Native Americans as slaves to Bermuda and other Caribbean colonies.\nIn 1696, notorious pirates Henry Every and Joseph Faro most likely used the ship during their time in and around Rhode Island.\nThe Marine Protected Area and Biosphere Reserve surrounding the islands is named after the ship.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHMS Seaflower\nMayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

        "content": "Megalithic architecture appeared in what is now the Netherlands during the Neolithic period, especially in the northeast. Megalithic structures, i.e. buildings made of large upright stones, occur in various forms and functions, mainly as burial sites, temples or menhirs (stones standing alone or in a formation). In the Netherlands, only burial complexes are known. These large stone tombs (Dutch: Hunebedden) were built between 3470 and 3250 BC by members of the Western Group of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK) and were used until about 2760 BC. After the end of the Funnelbeaker culture in the Late Neolithic, the sites were reused by the Single Grave culture and the Bell Beaker culture during the ensuing Early Bronze Age and, to a lesser extent, into the Middle Ages.Of the original 100 megalithic tombs in the Netherlands, 54 are still preserved today. Of these, 52 are located in the province of Drenthe. Two more are in the province of Groningen, one of which has been turned into a museum. There is also a site in the province of Utrecht whose classification as a megalithic tomb is uncertain. Destroyed megalithic tombs are also known from the province of Overijssel. Most of the surviving tombs are concentrated on the Hondsrug ridge between the cities of Groningen and Emmen.\nThe tombs attracted the interest of researchers early on. The first paper was published in 1547. A book published in 1660 by Johan Picardt, who believed that the tombs were the constructions of giants, was widely read. Titia Brongersma carried out the first known excavation of a Dutch megalithic tomb in 1685. In 1734, the first law was passed to protect the tombs, followed by others in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1846, Leonhardt Johannes Friedrich Janssen published the first nearly complete inventory of the tombs. In 1878, William Collings Lukis and Henry Dryden made the most accurate plans to date of many of the graves. Modern archaeological research on the megalithic tombs was initiated in 1912 by Jan Hendrik Holwerda, who completely excavated two sites. Shortly thereafter, Albert Egges van Giffen began further research. He measured all the sites, carried out numerous other excavations, and had almost all the graves restored by the 1950s. Van Giffen also developed a numbering system for the megalithic tombs that is still used today, with a capital letter for the province and a number ascending from north to south (and a lowercase letter for destroyed sites). Since 1967, there has been a museum in Borger dedicated exclusively to the megalithic tombs and their builders.\nThe chambers of the tombs were built of granite boulders deposited in the Netherlands during the Ice Age. The gaps between the stones were filled with dry stone made of small stone slabs. The chambers were then covered with earth. Some of the mounds also have a stone fence. Depending on whether the entrance to the chamber is on a long or narrow side, the graves are called dolmens or passage graves. Almost all sites in the Netherlands are passage graves, only one is a dolmen. The graves are similar in their basic structure but vary greatly in size. The length of the chamber ranges from 2.5 m to 20 m. Small chambers were built in all phases of construction, while larger ones were added only in later phases.\nDue to the unfavorable preservation conditions, only small amounts of human bones were recovered from the graves. These were mainly cremated remains. Only very limited information is available on the age and sex of the deceased.\nIn contrast, the grave goods were exceedingly rich. In some graves, thousands of pottery shards were discovered, which could often be reconstructed into hundreds of vessels. Other grave goods included stone tools, jewelry in the form of beads and pendants, animal bones, and, in rare cases, bronze objects. The diverse array of vessel forms and decorations permitted the identification of multiple typological levels, thereby enabling insights to be gleaned about the construction and utilization history of the graves.\n\n\n== Research history ==\n\n\n=== Early research (16th-18th century) ===\nThe modern study of the Dutch megalithic tombs commenced in 1547 with Anthonius Schonhovius Batavus (Antony van Schoonhove), canon of the St. Donatian's Cathedral in Bruges. In a manuscript, he referenced a passage in Tacitus' Germania in which \"Pillars of Heracles\" are mentioned in the land of the Frisians. Schonhovius equated these with one of the tombs near Rolde and mixed Tacitus' text with local legends. He assumed that the building material was brought here by demons who were worshipped under the name of Heracles. He also believed that the tombs were altars on which human sacrifices were performed. His text was subsequently adopted by numerous other scholars over the following decades, with the Pillars of Heracles or the \"Duvels Kut\" (\"Devil's Cunt\", another name used for the grave near Rolde according to Schonhovius) being recorded on several maps between 1568 and 1636.\n\nIt was more than a hundred years before anyone wrote about the Dutch megalithic tombs who had seen them. Johan Picardt, a native of Bentheim, worked as a pastor in Rolde and Coevorden, among other places, and was also responsible for the colonization of the bogs in the border region between Bentheim and Drenthe. In 1660, he published a three-part work on the antiquities of the Netherlands, particularly the province of Drenthe and the town of Coevorden. Picardt's views were strongly influenced by biblical stories. For example, he hypothesized that the megalithic tombs were built by giants who had migrated to Drenthe from the Holy Land via Scandinavia. This view became widespread, not least because of the impressive illustrations in Picardt's book. At the same time, before and during Picardt's lifetime, there were other (mainly German) researchers who rejected this idea and attributed the construction of the tombs to ordinary people. Picardt was also the first to provide detailed descriptions of the structure of the tombs and to mention ceramic vessels as burial objects.\nThe lawyer and historian Simon van Leeuwen also visited the megalithic tombs in the province of Drenthe a few years after Picardt and dedicated a section to them in his work Batavia Illustrata, published posthumously in 1685. Van Leeuwen also considered the possibility of giants as builders, but thought more of tall Cimbri and Celts.\n\nTitia Brongersma, a poet from Dokkum, conducted the inaugural known excavation of a megalithic tomb in the Netherlands in 1685. In collaboration with her cousin Jan Laurens Lentinck, the Schulthei√ü of Borger, she spearheaded the investigation of the Borger megalithic tomb (D27). Brongersma herself only published two poems about it, from which it emerges that she believed the grave was a temple dedicated to nature. However, she discussed this intensively with her friend Ludolph Smids, a doctor and poet from Groningen. Smids initially wrote a poem about the excavation. He published these poems in his work Po√´zije in 1694 and also added a more detailed description of the Ô¨Ånds and discoveries from the grave. Smids' publication of the excavation in Borger and his correspondence with Christian Schlegel led to the idea of giants as the builders of the megalithic tombs being increasingly rejected. However, Smids himself revised his views again after his conversion from Catholicism to Calvinism and again took up Picardt's views in his work Schatkamer der Nederlandse oudheden, published in 1711.\nIn 1706, Johannes Hofstede and Abraham Rudolph Kymmel conducted another excavation at a large stone tomb in Rolde (D17). In his report, Hofstede described the different layers within the site and the stratigraphic position of the pottery found. Unfortunately, the report did not influence Hofstede's contemporaries, as it was not published until 1848.\nIn the 1730s, new levees were constructed in significant portions of the Netherlands and northwest Germany, replacing the previous ones, which were based on wooden structures that had been damaged by imported shipworms. The new dikes consisted of stone-covered earth mounds, which is why erratic blocks became a highly sought-after building material. The unregulated search for erratic blocks also led to the removal of boundary stones. This prompted the government of Drenthe to issue a resolution on July 21, 1734, prohibiting such actions. At the same time, this resolution placed the megalithic tombs under protection. After two royal decrees in Denmark (1620) and Sweden (1630), this was the third law to protect antiquities in Europe.\nIn 1732, the affluent Amsterdam textile merchant Andries Schoemaker undertook a journey to Drenthe with the draughtsman Cornelis Pronk and his apprentice Abraham de Haen. This excursion resulted in the initial realistic depictions of the two megalithic tombs situated in the vicinity of Havelte (D53 and D54). Schoemaker also furnished a comprehensive account of the sites. Both draughtsmen subsequently returned to Drenthe. Two surviving drawings by Abraham de Haen of the megalithic tomb D53 from 1737 and one by Cornelis Pronk of the megalithic tomb Midlaren (D3) from 1754 provide insight into the evolution of these structures.\n\nIn 1756, Joannes van Lier was commissioned to restore the Eext megalithic tomb (D13). This site, which had been dug into the ground, had been discovered around 20 years earlier by a stone hunter and was also rediscovered by stone hunters in 1756. The vessels and axes found were sold to collectors. Two capstones were also removed. Van Lier conducted a comprehensive examination of the site and endeavored to restore the burial chamber to its original condition to the best of his ability. Just two days later, he published a newspaper article about his work. Shortly thereafter, Cornelis van Noorde created a drawing of the tomb. Henrik Cannegieter, the principal of the Latin school in Arnhem, authored a treatise on the tomb based on the newspaper article, despite having neither seen it himself nor contacted van Lier. At the suggestion of his friend Arnout Vosmaer, van Lier undertook a critical examination of this treatise in five lengthy letters. These letters ultimately resulted in the first monographic treatise on a Dutch megalithic tomb, which was published by Vosmaer in 1760.\n\nBetween 1768 and 1781, Petrus Camper created drawings of eight megalithic tombs. Among these was the Steenwijkerwold megalithic tomb (O1), which was destroyed in the 19th century.\nIn 1774, Theodorus van Brussel published a new edition of Ludolf Smids' Schatkamer der Nederlandse oudheden, which he augmented with extensive notes of his own. In this edition, van Brussel (who was unaware of van Lier's work) advanced the thesis that the megalithic tombs were natural formations that had formed on the seabed. He further postulated that, after the land had dried up, erosion had given them their present appearance.\nIn 1790, Engelbertus Matthias Engelberts published the third volume of his historical work De Aloude Staat En Geschiedenissen Der Vereenigde Nederlanden, which was aimed at a general audience. In it, he devoted himself in detail to the megalithic tombs and summarized the state of research at the time quite completely. He also added two (rather inaccurate) drawings of the Tynaarlo megalithic tomb (D6) to his text. It is also noteworthy that Engelberts observed that the flat side of the capstones in the tombs always faced downward. Consequently, he rejected the hypothesis that the structures had served as altars.\nIn 1790, the resolution to protect the megalithic tombs was renewed. In 1809, the Landdrost of Drenthe, Petrus Hofstede, once again prohibited the removal of stones from the graves and the digging of mounds. In 1818/19, the local authorities were obliged to closely monitor compliance with this law and to draw up annual reports.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1808, the Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, an academic society established by Adriaan Giles Camper, son of Petrus Camper, initiated a competition with the objective of elucidating the ethnic identity of the builders of the megalithic tombs.\nIn April 1809, the Emmen-Noord megalithic tomb (D41), which had previously been completely covered, was uncovered and examined. Johannes Hofstede, the brother of Petrus Hofstede, wrote a detailed report on this. His brother then obtained the exclusive right to conduct excavations in the province of Drenthe. Subsequently, he conducted further investigations at four additional megalithic tombs. However, the results of these excavations were not fully documented.\nNicolaus Westendorp made further important contributions to research at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1811, he visited the megalithic tombs in Drenthe and seven others in Germany. He wrote an extensive treatise, with which he finally won the competition announced in 1808. Westendorp described a distribution area of megalithic sites stretching from Portugal to Scandinavia. He assumed a common origin for all these sites. He adopted the observation made by van Lier that the megalithic tombs only contained stone tools. On this basis, Westendorp argued for a two-period system consisting of a Stone Age and a subsequent Metal Age. The Danish researcher Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen was strongly influenced by his work in the development of his Three-age system. Westendorp compared the inventories of the megalithic tombs with the material remains of several ancient peoples and excluded most of them due to their use of metal tools. As it was implausible for him to attribute them to a previously unknown people, he argued for early Celts as the builders. He first published his theories as an essay in 1815 and then as a monograph in 1822. Westendorp's work attracted considerable attention, but also attracted criticism. For example, his hypothesis that the Celts were responsible for the megalithic tombs was called into question, given the absence of such tombs in large parts of Central and Eastern Europe, despite the presence of Celtic populations in those areas.\nIn the 1840s, the division of communal land was imminent. The megalithic tombs were once again in jeopardy of destruction, prompting Johan Samuel Magnin, the provincial archivist of Drenthe, to submit a petition to King William II in 1841. The petition sought to exempt prehistoric tombs from the privatization of land. However, the petition was unsuccessful. A 1842 newspaper article by Dr. Levy Ali Cohen likewise failed to effect a change in the law.\nFurthermore, in the 1840s, two history books appeared that were quite popular at the time and aimed at a wide audience. These books devoted a significant amount of space to the megalithic tombs. In 1840, Johannes Pieter Arend published the first volume of his Algemeene Geschiedenis des Vaderlands. He primarily relied on the work of Engelberts and Westendorp, positing that the early Celts were the builders of the tombs. In contrast, Grozewinus Acker Stratingh advanced a novel theory in 1849, suggesting that the tombs had been constructed by unidentified ancestors of the Celts and Germanic tribes.\n\nThe most significant researcher of the 19th century was Leonhardt Johannes Friedrich Janssen (1806‚Äì1869), the curator of the Dutch antiquities collection at the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden. His interest in megalithic tombs began in 1843 when he had several models of the Tynaarlo megalithic tomb (D6) made for various museums. In 1846, he excavated the Exloo-Zuiderveld stone cist (D31a) and the Zaalhof megalithic tomb (D44a). In 1847, he undertook a study of the Dutch megalithic tombs in situ and published a paper on them the following year. Janssen thus presented the first comprehensive descriptive overview of the surviving megalithic tombs in the Netherlands. In 1849, he conducted a further excavation of the stone cist remains in the Rijsterbos (F1). He subsequently devoted himself to questions regarding the construction methods of the tombs and the way of life of their builders. Janssen's most significant error was the dating of the sites to a period that was considerably more recent than it was. He described the pottery finds as \"Germanic\" and considered the youngest graves to be Roman. In 1853, he fell in love with the Hilversum worker Dirk Westbroek, who had faked several hearths that were supposed to be from the Stone Age. One of the sites yielded a worked sandstone slab from the Middle Ages or Modern era. Janssen dated this to the Roman period and interpreted it as evidence that the Stone Age in the Netherlands only ended with the Romans. Janssen's error had a profound impact on prehistoric research in Leiden for decades to come. It was not until 1932 that the hearth sites in Hilversum were exposed as a forgery.\nThe writer Willem Hofdijk was profoundly influenced by Janssen's work and produced several works between 1856 and 1859, in which he crafted a vivid portrayal of Dutch prehistory. Of particular interest is his dating of the megalithic tombs, which he placed in his work Ons Voorgeslacht (Unsere Vorfahren) at approximately 3000 BC. At the time, they were generally considered to be much younger, but Hofdijk, perhaps by chance, assumed a date that roughly corresponds to the findings of modern scholarship.\nIn 1861 and 1867, illicit excavations resulted in significant damage to the large stone tomb De Papeloze Kerk (D49). To prevent further deterioration, by around 1870, the majority of the tombs had become the property of the state or the province of Drenthe. Subsequently, several sites were restored, albeit in an unprofessional manner, at the suggestion of amateur archaeologist Lucas Oldenhuis Gratama. Gratama adopted Westendorp's erroneous assumption that the graves originally had no mounds and therefore had them removed as supposed wind drifts without documentation.\n\nIn 1871, Augustus Wollaston Franks, the curator of the British Museum, undertook a visit to Drenthe. He was dismayed by the lack of professionalism evident in the restoration of the megalithic tombs. In response, Franks suggested that William Collings Lukis (1817‚Äì1892) and Henry Dryden (1818‚Äì1899) undertake a research trip to Drenthe in 1878. Both had previously conducted investigations of megalithic sites in the United Kingdom and Brittany, and now produced highly detailed floor plans and sectional drawings of 40 megalithic tombs in the Netherlands, in addition to several watercolors of pottery finds.\nWillem Pleyte, the successor of Janssen as curator at the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, published a comprehensive list of the archaeological sites in the Netherlands known at the time from 1877 onwards. He also made extensive use of photography for the first time. The first known images of Dutch megalithic tombs were taken in 1870. In 1874, Pleyte undertook a photographic expedition through Drenthe, accompanied by the photographer Jan Goedeljee. They photographed all the megalithic tombs in the region. Pleyte subsequently used these images as models for lithographs. It is notable that Conrad Leemans, the director of the Rijksmuseum, undertook a similar photographic expedition to Drenthe in 1877. Jan Ernst Henric Hooft van Iddekinge, who had already been to Drenthe with Pleyte, prepared plans of the megalithic tombs for Leemans. However, the quality of these plans did not match the work of Lukis and Dryden.\nThe realization that the Dutch megalithic tombs were part of a Stone Age culture that spanned large parts of northern and central Europe gradually gained acceptance from the end of the 19th century. Nicolaus Westendorp had already noted the great similarity to the graves in northwest Germany in 1815. Augustus Wollaston Franks observed in 1872 that not only the graves but also the grave goods found were very similar to those from Germany and Denmark. In 1890, the K√∂nigsberg prehistorian Otto Tischler established the existence of various regional groups within the Funnelbeaker Culture for the first time and defined the distribution area of the Western Group more precisely. At the beginning of the 20th century, Gustaf Kossinna distinguished four regional groups based on the pottery: a northern, western, eastern, and southern group. In the 1930s, Konrad Ja≈ºd≈ºewski presented an even more precise overview, subdividing Kossinna's eastern group into an eastern and south-eastern group.\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st century ===\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the physician Willem Johannes de Wilde made significant contributions to the field of research. Between 1904 and 1906, he conducted a comprehensive survey of the surviving megalithic tombs in the Netherlands, meticulously documenting his observations through detailed drawings, photographs, and a comprehensive catalog of questions pertaining to the architectural characteristics of each site. Unfortunately, the majority of his original notes have been lost, leaving only fragments of his insights.\nA new phase of megalithic research in the Netherlands commenced in 1912 with the excavation of two megalithic tombs near Drouwen (D19 and D20) by the Leiden archaeologist Jan Hendrik Holwerda. The following year, he conducted an investigation of the Emmen-Schimmeres megalithic tomb (D43).\n\nSubsequently, the Groningen archaeologist Albert Egges van Giffen conducted further excavations, which significantly influenced megalithic research in the Netherlands for several decades. In 1918, he conducted a comprehensive excavation of the Havelte 1 megalithic tomb (D53), a megalithic tomb situated in the vicinity of Emmerveld (D40), the Exloo-Noord megalithic tomb (D30), and two additional megalithic tombs. Excavations were conducted in the vicinity of Bronneger (D21 and D22) and a trial excavation was carried out at the Drouwenerveld megalithic tomb (D26), the Balloo megalithic tomb (D16) and another megalithic tomb near Emmerveld (D39). Additionally, between 1918 and 1925, he conducted investigations at the remains of three previously destroyed sites: the Steenwijkerwold megalithic tomb (O1), the stone cist in the Rijsterbos (F1), and the Weerdinge megalithic tomb (D37a). Furthermore, he conducted a comprehensive survey of all surviving sites in the Netherlands between 1925 and 1927, publishing the results in two volumes of text and an atlas. In this work, he also developed the numbering system for graves that is still in use today. This system employs a capital letter for the province, followed by a number ascending from north to south. It also includes a lowercase letter for destroyed sites. In 1927, van Giffen conducted further excavations at two additional graves: the Buinen-Noord megalithic tomb (D28) and the Eexterhalte megalithic tomb (D14). In the 1940s, he undertook investigations of the remains of several destroyed sites.\nDuring the Second World War, the stones of the Havelte 1 (D53) megalithic tomb were buried and a runway was constructed on its site. The airfield was subjected to aerial bombardment in 1944 and 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, the site was reconstructed in its original location.\nIn the 1950s, van Giffen devoted himself primarily to the restoration of the graves. He made missing wall stones visible by having their holes filled with concrete. In 1952, van Giffen conducted another excavation at the Annen megalithic tomb (D9). In 1957, he collaborated with Jan Albert Bakker at the Noordlaren megalithic tomb (G1). From 1968 to 1970, he worked with Jan Albert Bakker and Willem Glasbergen at the Drouwenerveld megalithic tomb (D26).\n\nThe concept of a museum dedicated to the megalithic tombs and their builders was first proposed by van Giffen in 1959. The exhibition, developed by Diderik van der Waals and Wiek R√∂hling, was initially presented in a restored farmhouse in Borger from 1967. However, the house was destroyed by fire on two occasions, resulting in the museum's relocation to the former almshouse near the Borger large stone tomb (D27). In 2005, a newly constructed visitor center with open-air facilities was inaugurated on this site under the name Hunebedcentrum.\nFurther excavations were conducted by Jan N. Lanting between 1969 and 1993. These investigations focused on the remains of several previously destroyed sites, the majority of which had been discovered by the amateur archaeologist Jan Evert Musch. Additionally, Lanting examined the Heveskesklooster megalithic tomb, which was only discovered in 1982 and subsequently converted into a museum in 1987.\nIn the 1970s, Jan Albert Bakker published his dissertation on the Western Group of the Funnelbeaker Culture, which remains an authoritative overview to this day. The burial inventories of the Dutch megalithic tombs known at the time constituted a significant portion of his data basis. In 1992, he published a monograph on the architecture of the graves, and in 2010, another on the history of research.\nIn the 1980s, Anna L. Brindley developed a seven-stage internal chronology system for the Funnel Beaker West group, based on the extensive pottery finds from the megalithic graves.\nThe few bone remains known from the Dutch graves were not systematically examined for a considerable period of time. This only changed in the years between 2012 and 2015, when Liesbeth Smits and Nynke de Vries analyzed the cremations found in the megalithic tombs.\nIn 2017, all the megalithic tombs in the Netherlands were recorded in a three-dimensional atlas using photogrammetry. The data was obtained from a collaboration between the province of Drente and the University of Groningen by the Gratama Foundation.\n\n\n== Population and distribution ==\n\nIt is not known how many megalithic tombs originally existed in the Netherlands. Probably there were more than 100. Today, 53 tombs have been preserved. In addition, there is one that has been turned into a museum and a stone complex that is questionable as to whether it is the remains of a megalithic tomb. In addition, 23 destroyed tombs are known to have been found. Jan Albert Bakker also lists nine possible sites for which only vague information is available from older literature and whose classification as megalithic tombs is uncertain (he considers information on 19 other sites to be unreliable). Bert Huiskes was also able to identify 96 field names for the province of Drenthe that indicate possible megalithic tomb ruins. \n\nThe megalithic tombs in the Netherlands were constructed by members of the Funnelbeaker culture, a Neolithic cultural complex that originated in Denmark and subsequently spread across large parts of Europe from approximately 4100 BC to 2800 BC. The Funnelbeaker Culture was divided into several regional groups, with the northernmost group extending from central Sweden to the Czech Republic, while the southernmost group extended from the Netherlands in the west to the Ukraine in the east. Megalithic burial structures were not a ubiquitous phenomenon throughout the entire distribution area, but rather were concentrated in specific regions, including Scandinavia, Denmark, northern and central Germany, northwestern Poland, and the Netherlands. The Dutch megalithic tombs, in conjunction with the sites in western Lower Saxony, are considered to be part of the western group of the Funnelbeaker Culture. The original total number of graves is difficult to ascertain with precision. Currently, approximately 20,000 sites are known to have survived or are known with certainty. Of these, over 11,600 are located in Germany, 7,000 in Denmark, and 650 in Sweden. The total number of all large stone tombs of the Funnelbeaker Culture ever erected is likely to have been at least 75,000, perhaps even up to 500,000. The Dutch tombs therefore represent a comparatively small group at the westernmost edge of the Funnelbeaker Culture.\nThe surviving graves are all located in the provinces of Drenthe and Groningen. The majority of them are concentrated in a narrow strip running from north-northwest to south-southeast on the Hondsrug ridge between the towns of Groningen and Emmen. Almost all of these graves are accessible via the N34 highway. Three sites are located some distance to the west of the main group near Diever and Havelte. In addition to the aforementioned sites, there is a loose scattering of several destroyed sites between the main group and the aforementioned sites. In the northern region of the province of Groningen, near the coast, the large stone tomb Heveskesklooster (G5) was discovered in 1983 beneath a terp in the municipality of Eemsdelta and subsequently relocated to the Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl.\nTwo megalithic tombs are known from the province of Overijssel. The Steenwijkerwold megalithic tomb (O1) was located in the province's far north, approximately 8 km from the two megalithic tombs near Havelte (D53 and D54). The Mander megalithic tomb (O2) was located east of the province, near the German border. A few kilometers to the north were the megalithic tombs near Uelsen in the county of Grafschaft Bentheim in Lower Saxony.\nThe Lage Vuursche stone (U1) is situated at a considerable distance from the other sites in the northern region of the province of Utrecht. If this is indeed the remains of a megalithic tomb, it would represent the southernmost and westernmost such tomb in the Netherlands and the westernmost in the distribution area of the Funnelbeaker culture.\nBakker also posits the possibility that megalithic tombs may have originated in the province of Gelderland, as similar megalithic burial sites have been identified in the neighboring region to the east, northern North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n\n== Grave architecture ==\n\n\n=== Grave types ===\nThe Funnelbeaker Culture is characterized by the construction of large stone tombs, which feature mounded burial chambers built from boulders. These are divided into several types based on various characteristics, with the main feature being the position of the entrance to the burial chamber. If it is located on a long side, it is referred to as a passage grave. The dolmen is the counterpart to the passage grave. It has an entrance on a narrow side or, in the case of very small structures (the Urdolmen), has no entrance at all. Further classification features include the number of passage stones, the shape of the mound, and the presence or absence of a stone enclosure.\nOf the 54 surviving enclosures in the Netherlands, 52 can be classified with certainty or a high degree of probability as passage graves. Another is too badly destroyed for a reliable classification. Albert Egges van Giffen once again distinguished four subtypes:\nThe term \"ganggraf\" (passage grave) was employed by Van Giffen to describe graves with a stone enclosure and a covered passage in front of the entrance.\n\nThe \"portaalgraf\" (portal grave) is defined by van Giffen as a type of grave whose entrance is preceded by a pair of passage stones without a capstone.\nThe \"trapgraf\" (staircase grave) is a type of enclosure sunk into the ground whose burial chambers are accessible by a stone staircase rather than a horizontal passage. The only example of this type in the Netherlands is the Eext megalithic tomb (D13). Tombs with this type of access construction are also rare in the rest of the Funnelbeaker Culture distribution area. Only four examples from Lower Saxony (the Deinste 1 megalithic tomb, the Krelingen megalithic tomb, the Sieben Steinh√§user C megalithic tomb, and the destroyed Meckelstedt 2 megalithic tomb) are known to be comparable.\nThe term \"langgraf\" (long grave) is used to describe a complex consisting of a long barrow bed enclosing multiple burial chambers. The only example of this type in the Netherlands is the Emmen-Schimmeres megalithic tomb (D43). Additionally, analogous sites of this type have been identified in Lower Saxony, including the Daudieck megalithic bed A, the Kleinenkneten II megalithic tomb, and the Tannenhausen megalithic tomb.\n\n\tSchematic representation of the passage grave types according to van Giffen\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn more recent literature (e.g., Bakker), the terms van Giffens are no longer used, and all these sites are instead referred to simply as passage graves. In Lower Saxony, the term Emsland chamber was coined for a sub-type of passage grave typical of the western group of the Funnelbeaker Culture. A large proportion of the Dutch passage graves also correspond to this type. The Emsland chamber is distinguished by a relatively lengthy, predominantly east‚Äìwest oriented burial chamber with an entrance on the southern long side, which is enclosed at a short distance by a stone enclosure.\n\nThe Heveskesklooster (G5) is a notable exception among the Dutch sites. It is the only known dolmen (or more precisely, a great dolmen) in the country. It consists of three pairs of wall stones on the long sides, a capstone on the northern narrow side, and three capstones. The entrance is located on the open southern narrow side.\nSmaller burial complexes, which are typically constructed by deepening the chambers into the ground and using small stone slabs, are referred to as stone cists. Examples of these structures from the Funnelbeaker period have also been identified in the Netherlands. However, these structures are not typically classified as large stone tombs.\n\n\n=== Mound fill and enclosure ===\n\nAll the graves originally had a mound fill. This was round in the smaller sites and oval in the larger ones. Only the Emmen-Schimmeres megalithic tomb (D43) has a different shape. Here, the two burial chambers lie in a slightly trapezoidal long bed with rounded narrow sides and a stone enclosure. An enclosure was also found in eight or nine other enclosures. These enclosures are invariably larger, with a chamber length of at least 8 m.\n\n\n=== Burial chamber ===\n\n\n==== Orientation ====\n\nIn the majority of passage tombs, the burial chambers are oriented approximately east‚Äìwest, with the entrance facing south. There is considerable variation in orientation, ranging from northeast‚Äìsouthwest to southeast‚Äìnorthwest. However, the ends of almost all chambers lie within the extreme points of the rising and setting of the sun and moon. Six chambers deviate from this and have an orientation between south-southeast-north-northwest and south-southwest-north-northeast.\n\n\n==== Chamber size and number of stones ====\n\nThe dimensions of the chambers exhibit considerable variability. The shortest chamber, with an inner length of 2.5 m, is observed in the large dolmen of Heveskesklooster (G5). The smallest passage grave was the destroyed megalithic tomb Glimmen-Zuid (G3), with an inner chamber length of 2.7 m and an outer length of 3.2 m. The Borger megalithic tomb (D27) has the largest burial chamber. It has an inner length of 20 m, an outer length of 22.6 m, and a width of 4.1 m.\nThe number of pairs of wall stones on the long sides is between two and ten, the number of capstones between two and nine.\n\n\n==== Chamber shape ====\nThe ground plan of the burial chambers of the passage tombs is typically slightly trapezoidal, with a slight widening on the left side as seen from the entrance. This widening is observed in 36 chambers, with a corresponding shape identified in 29 of them. However, the difference in width varies considerably. In the majority of the tombs, the width difference is between 7 cm and 50 cm. However, three chambers exhibit a significantly greater difference in width, with values of 87 cm, 88 cm, and 106 cm, respectively. Of the remaining seven chambers measured, five are wider at the right end than at the left. Here, the difference in width is only between 9 cm and 21 cm. In two chambers, both ends are exactly the same width.\n\n\n==== The entrance ====\n\nIn the majority of cases, the entrance to the chambers of the passage tombs is situated in the middle of the southern or eastern long side. In the tombs with three to five pairs of wall stones, the entrances are typically offset to the right. However, there are also instances where they are precisely in the middle and, on two occasions, they are offset to the left. Of the seven graves with seven pairs of wall stones, four have an entrance that is more or less precisely in the middle, one is offset to the left, and one is offset to the right. In the graves with nine or ten pairs of wall stones, the entrances are also in the middle or slightly offset to the right. Only the Emmen-Noord megalithic tomb (D41) deviates conspicuously from this construction method. The structure comprises four pairs of wall stones and has an entrance located at the western end of the southern long side between the first and second wall stones.\nThe entrance to the chamber is either a simple opening between two wall stones or preceded by a passageway, which typically has one or two pairs of wall stones. Only one grave has evidence of a passage with three pairs of wall stones. Longer corridors, such as those typical of the large stone tombs of the Funnelbeaker North group, do not occur in the Netherlands.\nAt the large stone tomb Eext (D13), a staircase leads to the entrance instead of a passageway. According to van Lier's investigation in 1756, this staircase consisted of four steps, each made of one or two flat stone slabs and bordered by two walls of rolled stones. At the bottom of the stairs was a threshold stone directly in the entrance to the chamber. In 1927, Albert Egges van Giffen discovered that the staircase construction had been destroyed.\n\n\n==== The chamber floor ====\n\nThe floor of the burial chambers is typically composed of multiple layers of different stones. The uppermost layer typically consists of burnt granite grus. This is followed by sandstone slabs or rubble of round or flat shape. In some graves, there appears to have been another layer of stones underneath. The floors are typically not level, but exhibit a slight decline towards the center. The differences in height range from 25 to 50 cm.\nIn the Funnelbeaker North Group, the burial chambers are frequently subdivided into multiple sections by stone slabs set vertically into the floor. This is less prevalent in the Western group and is only known from one grave in the Netherlands. In the northern megalithic tomb at Drouwen (D19), Jan Hendrik Holwerda discovered a row of three 70 cm long and 30 cm high slabs at the north-western end of the chamber, which delineated a small space 2 m wide and 1 m long.\n\n\n==== Dry stone ====\nThe gaps between the wall stones of the chambers were originally filled from the outside with dry stone made of horizontally laid hewn stone slabs. Only remnants of this remain today. The maximum preserved height of the masonry was 1.4 m in the large stone tomb Bronneger 1 (D21). In some of the very long chambers, larger gaps were not completely filled with dry masonry. Instead, smaller upright erratic blocks were also inserted, which did not carry a capstone.\n\n\n== Funerals ==\nIn contrast to many other areas with megalithic tombs, very little organic material has survived in the Dutch megalithic tombs. This also applies to the bones of the people buried here. Jan Hendrik Holwerda, during his investigation of the two sites in Drouwen, was able to identify poorly preserved human skeletal remains in grave D19. These were mainly teeth and remains of jaw bones.\nRemains of cremated remains were found in 26 graves. In some cases only a few grams were preserved, but more than 1 kg was recovered from each of the two megalithic tombs at Havelte (D53 and D54) and the destroyed megalithic tomb Glimmen 1 (G2). The total weight of cremated remains recovered from all Dutch megalithic tombs is just under 8 kg. In most cases the bone fragments could only be assigned to single individuals, but in two graves five individuals could be distinguished. A total of 48 individuals were identified.\nBones from several graves were radiocarbon-dated, confirming that they were from funnel beaker burials.\nOnly limited statements can be made about the sex and age at death of the burials, as neither could be determined accurately or at all for the majority of individuals. According to the analysis of Nynke de Vries, there is probably a slight surplus of males among the dead. Most of the individuals had died as adults. The burials of children and adolescents make up only a small proportion.\n\n\n== Enclosures ==\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\nCeramic vessels make up by far the largest part of the Funnelbeaker Period grave goods. The largest number comes from the megalithic grave Havelte 1 (D53). The sherds found here could be reconstructed into 649 vessels. The destroyed megalithic grave Glimmen 1 (G2) contained about 360 vessels and the megalithic grave Drouwenerveld (D26) 157.\n\nThe range of pottery forms is quite diverse. The funnel cup, a bulbous vessel with a long funnel-shaped neck, gave its name to the culture of the Great Stone Cavemen. Similar vessels with eyelets on the neck and shoulder are known as eyelet or showpiece cups. Collar bottles are small, bulbous bottles with a widening below the mouth. Amphora are bulbous vessels with a short cylindrical rim. The eyelet or dolmen bottle has a funnel-shaped neck, which can be very long in some specimens. There are one or two pairs of eyelets at the neck-shoulder junction. A similar vessel shape is the eyelet beaker, in which the eyelets are located near the base. Jugs are tripartite with a funnel-shaped rim and one or two handles. Shoulder cups have the same structure as jugs, but are wider than they are tall. Steep-walled cups have a straight wall that widens slightly at the top. There are also bowls with straight or convex walls and dishes. Fruit or foot bowls consist of a convex or funnel-shaped neck and a similar base. Both may be joined by one or two handles. Neck-grooved vessels are two-piece flat bowls with a conical rim. They do not appear until the late phase of funnel beaker culture. Tulle cups consist of a bowl and an attached hollow spout. Spoons have a solid handle instead of a spout. The two forms are not always easy to distinguish (especially when broken). There are also flat ceramic plates known as baking plates. The only shapes that have been found are a spindle-like object and a model of a stool or throne.\n\tCeramics\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Stone tools ===\nOther common grave goods are flint tools. These include hatchets, crossed arrowheads, scrapers, blades, and flakes. Crossed arrowheads are the largest group in terms of numbers. Hatchets, axes and stone hammers are rare. A club head is documented only once.\n\tStone tools\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Jewelry ===\nAmber beads are the most prevalent type of jewelry discovered. Occasionally, beads crafted from jet and quartz and pendants crafted from perforated fossils are also unearthed.\n\tJewelry\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Metal ===\nThe discovery of metal objects is a rare occurrence. In the Drouwen 1 megalithic tomb (D19), strips were found, while spirals were discovered in the Buinen 1 megalithic tomb (D28). Additionally, a sheet of copper or arsenical bronze was uncovered in the Wapse megalithic tomb (D52a). These are the oldest metal finds in the Netherlands.\n\tMetal findings\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Animal bones ===\nThe remains of burnt animal bones were discovered in 20 megalithic tombs. These included bones from domestic pigs, cattle, sheep/goats, horses, canids, bears, red deer, and possibly roe deer. It is likely that these bones were used as tools, although at least one bone seems to have been used as a food offering. Given that only claws were recovered from the bear, it is possible that the remains represent the cremated remains of a bearskin with which a person may have been wrapped.\n\n\n== Laying down in front of the graves ==\nThe discovery of Funnelbeaker pottery vessels and stone tools in front of the entrances to several megalithic tombs, including the Drouwenerveld megalithic tomb (D26) and the Eexterhalte megalithic tomb (D14), indicates that these items were deposited in these locations at a specific point in time. The removal of the mounds of the two megalithic tombs near Midlaren (D3 and D4) around 1870 may have uncovered corresponding ritual pits, though these were not recognized as such. The pottery is of similar quality and style to that found in the burial chambers and dates to the same period. However, storage vessels and baking plates as well as flint scrapers are absent from the deposits.\n\n\n== Dating of the Funnelbeaker Period phases of use ==\nThe range of forms and decoration of the ceramic vessels allows for the distinction of several typological stages within the Western Group of Funnelbeakers. These stages also indicate different phases of use of the megalithic tombs. The subject was previously studied by Heinz Kn√∂ll and Jan Albert Bakker, who conducted important earlier work in this field. The typological system that is still relevant today was developed by Anna L. Brindley in the 1980s. By comparing a substantial quantity of carbon-14 dating, Moritz Mennenga was able to present the most precise absolute chronological dating of these stages to date in 2017.\n\nLevel 1 pottery was discovered in five graves, representing the earliest archaeological material recovered. These graves were small enclosures with two to five pairs of wall stones, chamber lengths between 2.7 and 6.1 meters, round or oval mounds without enclosures, and an entrance with a pair of passage stones or without passage stones. Seven or eight additional graves were constructed during Stage 2. Some of these graves also contained small chambers, while others had larger chambers with up to seven pairs of wall stones and lengths of up to 12.4 m. The Drouwenerveld megalithic tomb (D26) and the Emmen-Schimmeres megalithic tomb (D43), which has two burial chambers, are the first graves to have a stone enclosure. All other graves of this level still have a mound without an enclosure. The peak of the construction of the megalithic tombs falls on level 3. In 13 tombs, the corresponding pottery represents the oldest found material. Both small and large enclosures continued to be erected. The chambers now had up to ten pairs of wall stones and were up to 17 m long. Mounds were constructed with or without enclosures, and the entrances had zero to two pairs of wall stones. No new megalithic tombs appear to have been erected after level 3. However, large quantities of pottery provide evidence for the continued use of almost all sites up to level 5, after which many graves were abandoned. Pottery from levels 6 and 7 was only found in a few sites. Furthermore, there is evidence of an interruption in the use of some graves. For instance, the destroyed large stone tomb Glimmen 1 (G2) was utilized during levels 3‚Äì5, abandoned in level 6, and then reused in level 7.\n\n\n== Subsequent use of the graves ==\n\n\n=== Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age ===\n\n\n==== Funerals ====\nIn the majority of Dutch megalithic graves, vessels and stone tools from the Single Grave Culture and the Bell Beaker Culture (both Late Neolithic) and the Early Bronze Age coiled cord pottery were discovered in addition to the Funnel Beaker Period grave goods. These findings are typically regarded as grave goods from secondary burials. What is noteworthy is that in addition to the typical burial pottery of this period, large amphorae and storage vessels were also discovered, which are otherwise only known from settlements. However, these are almost completely absent from individual graves. Therefore, it can be inferred that the megalithic tombs were utilized for special burials.\n\n\n==== Shell stones ====\nIn prehistoric times, small circular bowls were attached to several megalithic tombs in the Netherlands. During an investigation in 2018, Mette van de Merwe identified seven sites in which such carvings were present. In five cases, the small bowls are located on capstones, in one case on a wall stone, and in another case on an enclosure stone. The exact purpose of these bowls is unknown. Furthermore, there are no concrete indications as to their date in the Dutch graves. Therefore, a comparison with other regions is necessary. In his investigations of the megalithic graves in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Ewald Schuldt found no evidence that the bowls there were made by members of the Funnel Beaker Culture. They appear to be rather younger, as in several cases they were discovered in places that were probably only accessible again after a certain period of decay of the burial chambers. In contrast, several large stone graves with small bowls are known from Schleswig-Holstein, which were covered over again in the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age and used for new burials. For Jan Albert Bakker, this evidence suggests that the bowls can probably be dated to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age.\n\n\n=== Middle Bronze Age to Middle Ages ===\nFollowing the Early Bronze Age, the megalithic tombs appear to have been largely unused, as finds from more recent periods are exceedingly rare. A notched Bronze Age urn was discovered in the destroyed Spier megalithic tomb (D54a). A Middle Bronze Age razor was discovered in the Westenesch-Noord megalithic tomb (D42), while a vessel from the Iron Age Harpstedt group was unearthed in the Drouwenerveld megalithic tomb (D26). In 1750, a Roman silver coin is said to have been found in the Eexterhalte megalithic tomb (D14). In the late 18th century, a boat model was discovered in the Loon megalithic tomb (D15), which is believed to date to the Early Middle Ages. Two similar examples are of unknown origin.

He has served as a member of the Northern Mariana Islands Senate and as the Mayor of Rota.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nInos was born in 1947/1948 and was the brother of Governor Eloy Inos. Inos was elected to the Northern Mariana Islands Senate in the 1978 general election. During the 1st Commonwealth Legislature, he was a sponsor of the bill that set up the judicial branch of the Northern Mariana Islands.He then served sixteen years in the CNMI Senate representing Rota. He served as the floor leader in the 4th and 6th Legislature. During the 7th and 8th Commonwealth Legislatures, Inos was the President of the Senate.\nHe then served two non-consecutive terms as the Mayor of Rota. Inos announced his candidacy for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands on the Democratic ticket on January 19, 2018. Shortly after, he withdrew from the race on February 7, 2018, citing a lack of unified support from his predominantly-Republican family who sided with his brother's running mate and successor as Governor Ralph Torres.\n\n\n== References ==",

It will premiere on Sky Atlantic in late 2024.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series follows Benito Mussolini's career from his founding of the Fasci Italiani in 1919 through the assassination of socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti in 1925.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLuca Marinelli as Benito Mussolini\nFrancesco Russo as Cesare Rossi\nBarbara Chichiarelli as Margherita Sarfatti\nBenedetta Cimatti as Donna Rachele\nFederico Majorana as Amerigo Dumini\nGaetano Bruno as Giacomo Matteotti\nFulvio Falzarano as Giovanni Giolitti\nMassimo De Lorenzo as Alfredo Rocco\nLorenzo Zurzolo as Italo Balbo\nVincenzo Nemolato as Victor Emmanuel III\nGianmarco Vettori as Dino Grandi\nGabriele Falsetta as Roberto Farinacci\nMaurizio Lombardi as Emilio De Bono\nDaniele Trombetti as Cesare Forni\nGianluca Gobbi as Cesare Maria de Vecchi\nAlberto Astorri as Luigi Facta\nPaolo Pierobon as Gabriele D'Annunzio\nTaiyo Yamanouchi as Harukichi Shimoi\nJessica Piccolo Valerani as Ida Dalser\nGiorgia Sinicorni as Queen Elena\nPaolo Macedonio as Don Luigi Sturzo\nFederico Mainardi as Albino Volpi\nElena Lietti as Velia Matteotti\nGiovanni Alfieri as Amleto Poveromo\nAmedeo Gull√† as Augusto Malacria\nMichele Ferrantino as Giuseppe Viola\nCosima Centurioni as Bianca Ceccato\nDaniele Paoloni as Rodolfo De Bernardt\nClaudio Bigagli as Generale\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nSky Studios ordered the series in April 2022. At the Rome Film Festival in October 2022, it was announced that Joe Wright would direct the series with Luca Marinelli playing Benito Mussolini. Marinelli was producer Lorenzo Mieli's first choice for the role. Speaking about the series, Marinelli stated:\n\nWe don't want to celebrate Mussolini at all. He was a criminal. We only want to tell his story and who he was, in our own way, according to Joe [Wright]'s vision. All the adjectives used to describe Mussolini put a distance between us and him. We need to understand that he decided to do what he did, that he followed this path, and that he was always aware of what he was doing.\nThe series was filmed over a period of six months beginning in November 2022. Filming took place primarily in Rome at Cinecitt√† Studios. Other filming locations included the Palazzo Reale and the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, as well as Trieste, Aquileia, Gorizia, and Ruda in Friuli-Venezia Giulia.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe series was previewed at the Riviera International Film Festival in May 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM.

        "content": "\"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" is a story published in 1830 by the American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne. It is considered to be his first published short story.\nThe story is about a young woman who asks a fortune teller for information about the fate of her family. During their evening meeting in a hollow in the forest, the fortune teller (whether she is a witch remains unclear) conjures up three apparitions that reveal the young woman's sins and their consequences: She has abandoned her family, her parents are embittered, her husband is in an insane asylum, her child is dead. This early story already shows many of Hawthorne's typical stylistic characteristics and subjects - complex symbolism, enigmatic ambiguity, dark atmosphere, questions about the nature of sin, guilt, punishment and despair - which make him an outstanding representative of \"dark\" American Romanticism alongside Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAn hour before sunset, a graceful but desperate young woman and an old hag meet at a previously agreed location: a dark, barren hollow surrounded by three wooded hills, in the middle of which there is a putrid pond in which some tree trunks are slowly rotting away. According to the narrator, this is where the Prince of Darkness used to meet with his lost souls to perform his \"impious baptismal rite\". The young woman hopes to get information from the Vettel about the welfare of her loved ones, whom she has left behind in another country, and promises to do whatever is asked of her (\"though I die\").\nThe old woman makes the young woman kneel down, spreads a cloak over her face and murmurs \"prayers\" that are \"not meant to be acceptable in Heaven\". Soon other voices can be heard, at first clearly, then again they seem to merge with the sound of the autumn wind. They are the voices of an old man and an old woman who speak sadly about a daughter \"a wanderer they knew not where, bearing dishonor along with her, and leaving shame and affliction to bring their gray heads to the grave.\" After the voices have faded away, the old woman remarks with a grin that the old couple seem to be having a \"weary and lonesome time\". The young woman is shocked that the old woman has also heard the voices, but asks for more information. Again, the old woman mumbles monotonous words until screams, moans, sighs, rattling chains and the cracking of a whip can be heard. Then a familiar male voice is heard, telling of \"a wife who had broken her holiest vows, of a home and heart made desolate.\" When this apparition has passed, the old woman grins again and asks \"\"Couldst thou have thought there were such merry times in a madhouse?\" The young woman asks to hear just one more voice that is dear to her.\nWhen the noises have faded, the hag nudges the kneeling young woman, but she doesn't move. Giggling, she says to herself, \"Here has been a sweet hour's sport!\"\n\n\n== Context of the work ==\n\"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" is often referred to as Hawthorne's first short story. It first appeared anonymously in the Salem Gazette on November 12, 1830. Ten days earlier, on November 2 of the same year, the same newspaper had already published \"The Battle-Omen\", also anonymously, whose authorship is also attributed to Hawthorne by many literary scholars. In any case, it appeared during a phase of his life and work that Hawthorne's biographers often refer to as the \"lonely years\": After graduating from college, he lived with his family in relative poverty, seems to have avoided social contact and was disappointed in his writing ambitions. After the failure of his first novel Fanshawe (1828), he turned to the short story and remained faithful to this genre until 1850, when he finally mastered the novel form with The Scarlet Letter.\nAround 1830, Hawthorne planned two collections of short prose texts, but was unable to find a publisher and eventually destroyed his manuscripts. It is likely, though not certain, that The Hollow of the Three Hills was intended at least for the first collection (Seven Tales of My Native Land), and perhaps also for the second (Provincial Tales). The original context of the work is thus lost, which may well have led to misconceptions in the reception of the story; G. R. Thompson, for example, assumes that the stories in Provincial Tales were in a dialogical structure.\nIn 1837, Hawthorne included the story in his first published short story collection, the Twice-Told Tales. \"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" appeared here as the 15th of the 19 tales in the first of the two volumes. Poe praised the story as particularly successful in his review for Graham's Magazine (1842). He highlighted the economy and effectiveness of the narrative (\"Every word tells, and there is not a word which does not tell\"); apparently, they corresponded perfectly to his theory of the short story, which he formulated in a very similar way a few years later in his essay The Philosophy of Composition. The literary scholar Dan McCall believes to have identified direct borrowings from or allusions to \"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" in Emily Dickinson's poem \"I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain\".\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\n\n=== Narrative style ===\n\"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" is a story in which little happens; it is static, almost more of a draft than a story - for Marius Bewley, for example, it is a single \"poetically evoked symbol.\" Hans-Joachim Lang places it alongside the three early works \"The Battle-Omen\", \"The Wives of the Dead\" and \"An Old Woman's Tale\" in a series of Hawthorne's \"experiments with radical brevity,\" all of which are characterized by a rather abrupt ending, some of which even appear incomplete. Their radicality also lies in \"the author's resignation to explanation.\" If Hawthorne's characteristic brooding about responsibility and guilt, sin and atonement, forgiveness and damnation is undoubtedly present, and the story thus possesses qualities beyond the merely entertaining horror of ordinary horror literature, the narrator's peculiarly objective, almost impassive description of the events makes it difficult to make simple statements about their meaning. For Lang, as for Terence Martin, the fact that its \"moral\" is not expressed is what makes the story unique: the fragmentary \"visions\" of family chaos, social exclusion and personal isolation in the midst of a \"moral wilderness\" are so impressive precisely because they remain uncommented.\nThe narrative discipline makes the ambiguity for which Hawthorne is famous possible. Much remains mysterious in the course of the story. For example, it remains unclear whether the young woman is merely frozen or dead at the end of the story. Nor is it at all clear that occult powers are actually at work in the hollow, even as the introductory sentence emphasizes that at the time of the plot, the \"fantastic dreams and madmen's reveries were realized among the actual circumstances of life\".  A \"realistic,\" psychological reading is thus not excluded, according to which the supposed witch only guesses and projects the supplicant's inner fears and anxieties. Of the inmates of the asylum in the second apparition, the narrator says that their \"own burning thoughts had long since become their exclusive world\" - another typically Hawthornian thought: the danger of solipsism, the self as a prison, as a \"tomb of the heart.\"\nPoe already pointed out a narrative peculiarity in his review: Hawthorne's decision to convey the \"visions\" by means of the ear rather than the eye, which gives the story a peculiarly dreamlike, abstract character. In this respect, the narrative has a counterpart in \"An Old Woman's Tale\", in which a procession of ghosts proceeds entirely silently and is conveyed solely by the visible.\n\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe time and place of the plot remain extremely vague: it takes place in an unspecified location \"in those strange old times, when fantastic dreams and madmen's reveries were realized among the actual circumstances of life Terence Martin sees this as a variation on the formula \"Once upon a time ...\": time is the place, a \"neutral\" setting in which the distinction between the real and the fantastical is abolished, as in a fairy tale. The opening sentence of this early short story thus already points to the Romantic understanding of art that Hawthorne formulated in his preface to the novel The House of the Seven Gables (1851): the author asks for artistic freedom beyond the strict imperatives of truthfulness or plausibility in order to fathom the deeper \"truth of the heart\".\nUnlike many of his best-known short stories (\"Young Goodman Brown\", \"The Minister's Black Veil\") or his most famous novel The Scarlet Letter, \"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" is not explicitly set in the Puritan colonial era in Massachusetts. Although Michael J. Colacurcio points out the possibility that the setting of the story alludes to the topography of the city of Boston, which was built on three hills, he considers this too unspecific; Hawthorne had not yet found his purpose as a chronicler of the \"moral history\" of New England in this early story. Carl H. Sederholm disagrees with this interpretation and believes that the narrator's references to \"those strange times\" and the \"gray tradition\" make it clear that Hawthorne was precisely interested in an examination of the past. He shows that the transmission and communication of the past, especially through the academic historiography of the 19th century with its rational view of the world, is inadequate - in order to understand history (especially that of New England), one must understand that \"superstition\", which is ridiculed today, once had a firm place as a category of understanding. History therefore had an irrational, \"visionary\" quality that had no place in positivist historiography, but could be portrayed in literature.\nThere is a close relationship with the explicitly historical narratives through the prominent motif of witchcraft, which Hawthorne repeatedly imposed on himself, partly because of his family's involvement in the Salem witch trials. Ely Stock also believes that the story contains a specific biblical background- the story of the witch of Endor (1 Sam 28:3-25 ), but Kenneth W. Staggs rejects this as unconvincing. In any case, the motif is borrowed from the inventory of horror literature, which Hawthorne makes ample use of in his work. Occultism and magic are not Hawthorne's actual concern, and so the narrator also refuses to pass judgment on whether the devil is actually up to mischief in the hollow, but merely refers succinctly to the fact that \"gray tradition\" wants it that way; the word \"witch\" is also conspicuously absent; the fortune teller is just an \"aged crone\".\nThe motif of the \"fallen woman\" points to another genre, the \"sentimental\" literature, whose authors (the market was dominated by women) Hawthorne later denigrated in a much-quoted curse about the \"damned mob of scribbling women\". It is the combination of these two genres that provides Hawthorne with opportunities to undermine sentimental clich√©s. For example, Staggs points out that the fairly conventional sin of adultery is usually atoned for in sentimental literature by the protagonist \"going into water\", whereas Hawthorne's sinner is unmistakably doomed when she kneels in the foul water of the pond in the hollow. Her sin is more serious than a mere breach of social convention (marriage or gender roles in general), but is tantamount to a sin against nature and the cosmic order.\n\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nMany interpretations of the story focus on the strongly symbolically charged setting of the story. In their structuralist analyses, both Staggs and Clinton S. Burhans interpret it as a mythical symbol of a (disturbed) cosmic order. Burhans sees the symbolism of the story as being layered into a fully developed allegory and directs attention to the carefully worked out contrast between the beautiful and the ugly, youth and age, growth and decay. It first becomes clear in the young woman's encounter with the \"withered\" and \"decrepit\" old woman and is soon reversed, as the young woman is also \"affected by premature decay in the prime of life.\" The decay of these two mortals is then linked to that of their natural surroundings; the young sinner dips the border of her garment \"into the pool\" to receive the visions and thus becomes one with the hollow where nothing grows but \"brown grass of October\" and where only dead tree trunks rot. Burhans also recognizes a sexual symbolism here: the hollow as a symbol of the womb, just as sterile and fruitless as the unfaithful relationship that drove the young woman to her doom. According to Burhans, another symbolic level is of a theological nature and points to salvation and damnation: the sinkhole appears as Hades or hell; the immersion of the robe in the putrid water is reminiscent of the \"impious baptismal rite\" that the devil is said to have once performed in this very place. The story ends with the sunset, which plunges the hollow into complete darkness. The hollow stands in contrast to the surrounding hills, which are densely wooded and bathed in a bright light by the setting sun. Burhans interprets them as a symbol of the Trinity, and their geometric regularity (the hollow they enclose is \"almost mathematically circular\") also points to the perfection of the natural order. In this allegorical reading, the fact that the young woman is doomed becomes certain early on in the story, namely at the moment when she looks up \"to the edge of the hollow, as if considering whether she should not better return home without having achieved anything. But fate would have it otherwise\".\nStaggs sees the number three as a leitmotif, if not a structural principle of the story: the three visions successively illustrated the young woman's individual, social and \"cosmic\" responsibility and reflected a theologically connoted sequence of purity-sin-atonement. As a classical (or Christian) symbol of perfection, it contributes to the mythical character of the narrative, which Staggs emphasizes. However, Hawthorne turns the familiar topoi into their opposite: the hollow corresponds to a \"sacred center\", like the navel of the world at Delphi ‚Äì a place of hierophany, an interface between the worlds of the sacred and the profane and therefore also the seat of a famous oracle. But this actually \"holy\" place is desecrated in Hawthorne's story: the devil is the godfather of the baptism rites that take place here, and the prayers that are said here are \"not meant to be acceptable in Heaven\". Instead of growth and wisdom, this place produces only decay and death.\n\n\n=== Sin and guilt ===\nOther commentators are more cautious with such far-reaching \"cosmological\" interpretations, but likewise see a gravity to the young woman's guilt that goes beyond mere adultery. Michael J. Colacurcio points out that the burden of guilt becomes heavier and heavier as the story progresses: He believes he has identified the pivotal point of the story at the moment when the young woman is surprised to discover that the old hag not only conjures up the \"visions\", but also partakes of them herself (\"'So you heard them too!' she cried, and a feeling of unbearable humiliation triumphed over despair and fear\"); the inner torment of her soul is made all the more painful by her shame towards others. The young woman only commits her most serious sin in the course of the story when she decides to transgress the barriers of \"natural\" knowledge and gain knowledge to which she is not entitled. Her willingness to do anything to achieve this, including surrendering to diabolical powers, reveals a variation on the Faust material in the story.\nDavid Downing sees the story as dramatizing not so much the individual guilt and damnation of the young woman, but rather that of a society. Like a lens, the hollow at its center focuses the suffering not only of the young woman, but of her embittered parents, her insane husband, the nameless voices of the funeral procession, and thus of her entire culture, if not of humanity; their voices not only merge, but also become one with those of the autumn wind; they are all equally marked by decay. Hawthorne may have had the Puritan view of humanity in mind here, with its belief in innate depravity, the necessarily corrupted nature of man through original sin, but ultimately it becomes clear that this is a man-made hell full of perfidy, madness, curse and brutality. Hawthorne is describing a culture that he intuitively senses brings great suffering to mankind.\nHans-Joachim Lang criticizes such speculative interpretations as ahistorical; they do not take into account the traditional Christian notions of evil in general and the devil in particular, which Hawthorne's story also presupposes. Accordingly, the devil is not only implicitly but actually present at the young woman's rendezvous with the witch; the narrator assures us that the two of them in the hollow \"no mortal could observe them\"; but the devil is not mortal. For Lang, the biblical knowledge that the devil is the \"father of lies\" (John 8:44 ) is indispensable for understanding the story - there is no reason to assume that the three visions tell the truth about the fate of the young woman's family, the opposite is the case. The young woman had lost hope and faith and had therefore \"gone to the devil\" - not (only) in the sense of a ghost story, but in the actual, theological sense.\nAlison Easton points out that the story offers not only no narrative, but also no ethical d√©nouement. The reader can hardly conclude with the conviction that the young woman has received her just punishment, for to do so would be to join the witch, who has the last word in the story. Like the reader, the woman is trapped in the same conventional value system that cannot excuse her transgressions; the moral conflict remains unresolved for her as for the reader.\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\nOpinions on the quality of the story vary considerably. In contemporary criticism, Poe saw the story as an outstanding example of Hawthorne's special abilities (\"an excellent example of the author's peculiar ability\"). Furthermore, in his assessment of the story he formulated: \"Every word tells, and there is not a word which does not tell\". This statement represents the highest honor Poe could bestow as a literary critic.\nSimilarly, Burhans takes the story as proof that Hawthorne achieved mastery in his very first tale; similarly Staggs, who sees here a triumph in the density of atmosphere unrivaled even by far better-known stories such as \"Young Goodman Brown\" and \"My Kinsman, Major Molineux\". Colacurcio considers it unsuccessful due to its all too unspecific subject matter, hardly more than an aesthetic finger exercise, and Neal Frank Doubleday also sees the story as a journeyman's piece at best and does not even acknowledge it with a review in his monograph on Hawthorne's early stories. For Lea Newman, too, the story is too abstractly conceived and too diffusely executed to be \"effective\" as literature. More recently, however, it has often been said to be ahead of its time precisely because of its peculiarly experimental structure and to correspond to modern or postmodern concepts of the short story.\nRegardless of quality judgments, however, there is a consensus that this early story (unlike the first novel) anticipates Hawthorne's later work both stylistically and thematically; in the canon of his stories, however, \"The Hollow of the Three Hills\" occupies a rather marginal position.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Editions ===\nThe first edition of the Twice-Told Tales can be found digitized in the Internet Archive:\n\nHawthorne, Nathaniel (1837).

It is one of the 105 decisive western paintings chosen for Michel Butor's imaginary museum.\nPainted at the start of his career and exhibited at the 1890 salon des Ind√©pendants, Rousseau chose its title to claim a neutral status for it between the usually totally distinct genres of portrait painting and landscape painting. It also shows him wearing as a buttonhole the insignia of the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques, which was awarded to a namesake of his but never to him, while his two wives' first names are on the palette (replacing an earlier idea of the inscription \"To not forget\" (\"Pour ne pas les oublier\"). As well as his private life, the idealised urban background shows elements of contemporary life - the now lost metallic pont du Carrousel, the shadow of a hot-air balloon and the new Eiffel Tower. - and (at top left) a red sun behind a cloud inspired by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me's 1884 Les deux majest√©s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karala Janaka ( Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ú‡§®‡§ï ) was one of the kings during the periods of Janaka Dynasty in the kingdom of Mithila. Most of scholars has accepted King Karala Janaka as the last King in the Janaka Dynasty of the Mithila Kingdom. According to the available literary texts related to Mithila, it is evident that there may be two different kings with the same name Karala Janaka in different periods of time in the ancient Mithila Kingdom. The one which is mentioned in Shanti Parva of Mahabharata and the other as the last King in the Janaka lineage mentioned in the Arthshastra of Chanakya.\n\n\n== Description in Mahabharata ==\nIn the Shanti Parva of MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, there is a philosophical dialogue between Guru Vashishtha and King Karala Janaka known as Vashishtha Karala Janaka Samvad. The dialogue is about the teaching of Shamkhya philosophy to the king Karala Janaka by the Vedic sage Brahmarshi Vashishtha. It describes the Twenty five tattvas. These tattvas are described with slight difference from the SƒÅ·πÉkhya philosophy. Shanti Parva describes twenty five tattvas in five Sargas called Vidya Sarga, Avidya Sarga, Bhutasarga, Vaikrtasarga and Bhautika Sarga.\n\n\n=== Concept of Purusha and Prakriti ===\nOnce King Karala Janaka was confused in understanding the meaning of Purusha and Prakriti in Shamkhya philosophy. He mistakenly understood \"Purusha\" as man ( male gender ) and \"Prakriti\" as woman ( female gender ). He told Guru Vashishtha that the relationship between Purusha and Prakriti is same as the reproductive relation between male and female. Male and female of all the creatures unite to reproduce. He further said that father contributes bone, sinews and marrow, and mother contributes blood, skin and flesh to their children. But this was a false analogy. Then Guru Vashishtha replied to the king that you had understood the superficial meaning of the texts not the real meaning. He further clarified the real meaning of the texts. He told that all the parts of the body including skin, blood, flesh, bones, and sinews etc come from Prakriti not from Purusha. \nGuru  Vashishtha further quoted \"Matter can arise from matter only not from spirit. But Prakriti itself is sexless and genderless, though the things that arise from it acquire sex and gender\".\n\n\n== Description as last King in Janaka Dynasty ==\nIt is said that Mithila was ruled by the Janakas for more than five centuries and the last king of the Janaka dynasty was Karala Janaka, who was overthrown along with his kingdom and family through a popular uprising and died.\n\n\n=== Death of Karala Janaka ===\nKing Karala Janaka, who was on a pilgrimage to Yogeshwara, saw the crowd of people with curiosity, there he saw a young and beautiful wife of a Brahmin and being lustful he forcibly took her into the city. Then the Brahmin became angry and went into the city crying and cursed \"Why does the city not break down where such an evil soul resides?\" It is said that because of his curse the earth cracked  there and consequently the king along with his entire family got buried in it. This story is mentioned in Arthshastra and Buddhacharitra.\n\n\n== After the Death of Karala Janaka ==\nAfter the death of Karala Janaka, Mithila became a republic and a constituent part of the Vajjian confederacy, which was later destroyed by King Ajatashatru of Magadha. But according some scholars, Mithila remained monarchy even after the end of Janaka Dynasty.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "That's Nice is an album by the Barry Altschul Quartet / Quintet, led by drummer Altschul, and featuring saxophonist Sean Bergin, trombonist Glenn Ferris, double bassist Andy McKee, and, on two tracks, pianist Mike Melillo. It was recorded on November 25‚Äì26, 1985, at Barigozzi Studio in Milan, Italy, and was released on vinyl in 1986 by Soul Note.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow noted that Altschul \"gets to show off his versatility and talents\" on the album, and wrote: \"In general, the music has many free moments, yet is not afraid to swing or to include melodies. A stimulating set.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings described the album as \"not a memorable\nset,\" and commented: \"The quartet tracks with just horns are more arrestingly original than the two with pianist Melillo, who shifts the direction back towards the mainstream. Bergin has some incendiary moments and Ferris and McKee bring in some interesting compositional material.\"\nA writer for Coda stated that the album \"utilizes some of the innovations of the past to create new music,\" and praised the contributions of trombonist Ferris, noting that he \"has finally found the perfect platform for his talents and hopefully will be with Altschul for a long time.\" He remarked: \"I eagerly look forward to the Barry Altschul Quartet's next album. There is great potential in this unit.\"\nSteve Holtje of MusicHound Jazz wrote: \"The problem with That's Nice... is summed up by its bland title, which matches the bland music. Perhaps it was important to Altschul to demonstrate his mainstream abilities with a group of non-stars... but the enervated results sound shallow.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Ahfra Love\" (Glenn Ferris) ‚Äì 7:19\n\"Blues Interrogation\" (Andy McKee) ‚Äì 7:20\n\"Satarumbarengue\" (Barry Altschul) ‚Äì 7:43\n\"That's Nice\" (Barry Altschul) ‚Äì 9:47\n\"For 'Papa' Jo, 'Klook' And 'Philly' Too\" (Barry Altschul) ‚Äì 12:11\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul ‚Äì drums\nSean Bergin ‚Äì alto saxophone, tenor xaxophone\nGlenn Ferris ‚Äì trombone\nMike Melillo ‚Äì piano (tracks 3 and 4)\nAndy McKee ‚Äì double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Schloss by the Water (German - Wasserschloss) or Schloss Kammer on the Attersee I (Schloss Kammer am Attersee I) is a 1908 oil on canvas painting by Gustav Klimt now in the National Gallery Prague.\nIt is the first of four oil on canvas paintings in a series created in 1908-1910 during a summer holiday at the Villa Oleander at Sch√∂rfling am Attersee. Klimt and the Fl√∂ge family rented the village from Scloss Kammer's owner, Countess Kefenh√ºller. Reviews called it \"the main and most brilliant work\" at the 1909 Vienna Art Exhibition, where it was first exhibited. It was exhibited the following year at the Union of Czech-German Artists in Prague, from which it was acquired by its current owner.\nThe work reflects a change in Klimt's painting, with a stronger composition than previously and the painting's strictly parallel structure. He chose a viewpoint from the quay by the villa, from which the Schloss's cubic facade could be seen behind the lake's reflective surface through the tall pyramidal poplars. Using a self-invented cardboard 'viewfinder', a telescope and opera glasses, he also dissected the visible landscape into separate areas before rearranging them into separated planes of lake and shore - the church bell tower looks close to the Schloss but is in reality about 800 metres away by water in Seewalchen. The lack of shadows, the horizon line right at the top of the painting, the reflection and the limited palette of white, ochre and green allowed him to flatten the image but still portray the landscape in a realistic-illusionistic fashion.\n\n\n== References ==",

The family is considered one of the most powerful groups in the country, due to the business conglomerate in media, mining, tourism, and banking that is under its ownership. Most notably, the family is the owner of El Comercio Group, a media conglomerate that owns the newspaper of the same name.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe family traces its origins to Tom√°s Mir√≥ and his wife Josefa de Quesada, who left San Juan de Penonom√© in Panama towards Peru in 1847. They had six children: Antonio, Luis, Aurelio, √ìscar, Miguel and Josefa \"Pepita\" Mir√≥ Quesada. Of these children, Antonio (Panama; January 19, 1845 ‚Äî Lima; October 30, 1930) became the sole owner of El Comercio, a newspaper originally founded in 1839 by Jos√© Manuel Amun√°tegui y Mu√±oz (Chile, June 3, 1802 ‚Äî Lima October 21, 1886) and Alejandro Villota (Buenos Aires, 1803 ‚Äî Paris, February 20, 1861), after the death of co-owner Luis Carranza Ayarza in 1898 as part of an arrangement between both parties.

        "content": "Skirgaila is a four-part play by Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius. Originally written in Russian during the First World War in 1916, and republished in Lithuanian in 1925, the play is based on the political, cultural, and religious problems of 14th century Lithuania.\nIt is described as a work heavily influenced by Romantic era values such as love, freedom, respect, and patriotism. Due to its psychological depth and intricate characters, Skirgaila is considered one of the best plays in Lithuania, and one of its first historical dramas along with ≈†ar≈´nas. Writer Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas described the play as \"<...> the strongest work of drama of Krƒóvƒó. It does not have such abundant epics and lyrical ramifications as in ≈†ar≈´nas. A strong dramatic tension is felt in the work - His style is bright, emotional, and suggestive, and the language is individualized according to the character of the affected persons. Finally, the person of Skirgaila is equal to the meaningful, most tragic characters of European dramaturgy.\" The main character, Skirgaila, was described as a symbolic person of the era, in whose disappointment the reader feels the tragedy experienced by the whole of pagan Lithuania.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first draft of Skirgaila was written in 1916 during the First World War, while Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius was stationed in the Caucasus. It was printed in Russian in 1922. After the play was staged at the Kaunas State Theater by Borisas Dauguvietis in 1924, the play was re-edited and re-published in Lithuanian in 1925. The play was also staged in 1966, 1981, and 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAs regent of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for his brother Jogaila, Skirgaila is the duke of Lithuania, Trakai, Polotsk, and Kyiv. His reign over Lithuania is marked by conflict with the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order for land while the question of Christianization constantly lingers as Skirgaila is converted to Christianity but holds himself a pagan. Lithuania's pagan priest, the vaidila Stardas is enthusiastic about going to war with the Teutonic Order to preserve the pagan way of life. He dies in battle and Skirgaila falls into a drunken depression as he loses his source of authority. Meanwhile, Keller, a young German monk-knight, tries to seduce Ona Duonutƒó, duchess of Lida, who is married to a Mazovian duke. Skirgaila forcefully marries Ona Duonutƒó to keep the lands of Lida from breaking away. Keller then tries to escape from Ona Duonutƒó's bedroom, but to not be caught, replaces the body of Stardas with his own. His inner monologue, which is represented by the Light Man and the Dark Man, questions whether to save his life or sacrifice himself for Ona Duonutƒó. Keller decides to sacrifice himself as Skirgaila buries him alive. Skirgaila, after convincing himself that he is not fit for ruling and that he has not saved pagan traditions, degrades as a character.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 21 June 2017, 41-year-old Indonesian maid Khasanah had murdered her 79-year-old Singaporean employer Chia Ngim Fong (Ë∞¢‰ªªÊñπ X√¨e R√®nfƒÅng), and Chia's 78-year-old wife Chin Sek Fah (ÈôàÈõ™Âçé Ch√©n Xuƒõhu√°) at the couple's flat in Bedok Reservoir Road, Singapore. It was alleged that Khasanah, who did not like Chin scolding her and was unhappy working for the couple, decided to flee the country and in her escape plans, she restrained the couple by gagging and tying them up before she killed them by battering Chia with a stool and stomping onto Chin until both of them died. Khasanah fled to Indonesia, where she spent a week on the run before she was arrested by the Indonesian police for the double murder, which became known as the Bedok double murder.\nHowever, Khasanah was not extradited back to Singapore for trial given that Indonesian law decreed that any Indonesian citizens who committed crimes overseas but caught in Indonesia should be tried in their home country instead of facing extradition to whichever jurisdiction where the said offence took place. Hence, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Indonesian National Police (POLRI) coordinated with each other to solve the case. Eventually, Khasanah stood trial in an Indonesian court from February to May 2018 for the double murder, for which she was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Upon her appeal, Khasanah's life sentence was lowered to 20 years' jail, and she is currently serving her sentence at an Indonesian prison for the double murder. On Singapore's side, a coroner's inquiry was conducted in September 2020, three years after the crime, and State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam found Khanasah guilty of murder in absentia after determining that the deaths of Chia and Chin were an unlawful killing perpetuated by Khasanah.\n\n\n== Double murder ==\nOn the afternoon of 21 June 2017, at about 3.39pm, an elderly couple was discovered dead by their nephew in their 6th-floor HDB flat at Bedok Reservoir Road.\nThe victims were identified as 79-year-old Chia Ngim Fong and his 78-year-old wife Chin Sek Fah, who both stayed together with one of their two sons at the flat. It was learned that the son, who went to work at 9am on that same day, was unable to contact his parents and hence, the couple's nephew went to check on them both, which led to the gruesome discovery. Both Chin and Chia were found with their limbs tied, although Chia had bloodstains and visible injuries on his body while Chin did not, and several items were also missing from their house. Chia and Chin were survived by their three daughters and two sons at the time they died. A 28-year-old undergraduate told the police that he heard shouts coming from somewhere nearby where the Chias lived, at around 3pm. Chia was reportedly described to have mobility problems and suffered a small stroke.\nAccording to neighbours, the couple were known to be friendly and loving. A 68-year-old retiree, who also lives on the same floor as the Chias, said she often saw the couple going out together and they had lived in the flat for more than 30 years, and she found Chin to be \"very happy-go-lucky and chatty\" while Chia was slightly more quiet. A 63-year-old retiree named Said Nasir, who lived two floors below the Chias, expressed his shock over the double murder and said he often saw the couple and greeted each other as they went to send meals for their children, one of whom owned a foreign maid agency, which operated for the last 12 years and located in Bukit Timah. Many other residents of the neighbourhood were similarly shocked to hear that the couple were brutally murdered, given that the neighbourhood was very peaceful, and a 70-year-old minimart proprietor described Chin, who often came to his store to buy groceries like eggs and biscuits, as a kind and friendly woman who often give money to the cleaner who works in the estate to buy lunch. Before their retirement, the couple owned a department store from 1977 to 1990, and also ran three shops selling shoes, beauty products and other items till 2000.\nKnown as the Bedok double murder, the murders of Chia Ngim Fong and Chin Sek Fah were considered as one of Singapore's most shocking crimes (also including the murder of Spencer Tuppani and Woodlands double murders) to happen during the year 2017.\n\n\n== Arrest of Khasanah ==\nThe police classified the double deaths of Chin Sek Fah and Chia Ngim Fong as murder, and they publicly appealed for witnesses to assist in their investigations. Later on, the police managed to identify one suspect, who was the couple's Indonesian maid Khasanah. Khasanah, who went by one name, was 41 years old and had worked for the couple for one month, but her whereabouts were unknown at that point when her employers were discovered dead. Based on further investigations, Khasanah was believed to have fled Singapore for an Indonesian island, as there were evidence of Khasanah reportedly boarding a ferry out of Singapore, which was bound to either Batam or Tanjung Balai on Great Karimun Island. From this, Khasanah was officially wanted by the Singaporean police on charges of murder and the Singapore Police Force also sought the assistance of their Indonesian counterparts to arrest Khasanah. Under Singaporean law, an offender found guilty of murder could be sentenced to death by hanging or to life imprisonment.\nFurther reports also revealed that Khasanah was employed through the agency of the couple's son, and the couple's godson, who worked at the agency and hired Khasanah, reportedly expressed remorse during an interview for having indirectly caused his godparents' deaths by hiring the same maid who allegedly killed them, and his sister tried to dissuade him from blaming himself. The couple's family also stated that Chia and Chin had always treated the maid well and even brought her along during their outings, and they were unable to find any reason why Khasanah would murder Chia and his wife, and they also expressed their desire for justice to be served no matter how long it took.\nA week after the Bedok double murder, at Hotel Nanber in Tungkal Ilir, Jambi province, Sumatra, the Indonesian police managed to arrest Khasanah inside her hotel room after receiving a tip-off. Among the items found in Khasanah's possession were several pieces of jewellery, watches, mobile phones, a laptop and cash amounting to no more than $300 in various currencies. It was revealed through the press that Khasanah had hidden inside the engine room of a ferry bound for Indonesia, which was why she was able to leave Singapore without a passport, and she even registered herself with her own identity card at the same hotel where she was caught, and also frequented a nearby internet cafe for three days. Syartini, the 54-year-old hotel owner who allowed Khasanah to stay at his hotel, was reportedly shocked to see the police arriving to apprehend Khasanah for the Bedok double murders, and he stated he would have reported Khasanah to the police had he knew about her atrocities, and he also told police that Khasanah had plans to leave for Java as of the time when she was arrested.\nLuthfi, the internet cafe owner, also told reporters that normally, his store was frequented by young men or teenage boys who came to play games, but Khasanah caught his attention for coming to read the news on the Internet and he thus felt something was amiss. Another man, 24-year-old Hariyanto, stated that he saw Khasanah was searching specifically for news about a murder in Singapore, and after finding out there was a double murder suspect who happened to share the same name as Khasanah, he and his same-aged friend Tommy became suspicious. Tommy also said that Khasanah once mentioned about going to a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) \"to make amends\", and it made him feel suspicious since the Indonesian police had, in recent months arrested several pesantren staff and students over suspected extremist beliefs. The most important detail was, a witness also overheard Khasanah talking to someone on the phone about her killing two people while at the internet cafe. Luthfi later confirmed it was one of his customers who alerted the police about Khasanah.\nAlthough she was arrested, Khasanah, however, would not be sent back to Singapore to face trial for the murders, because under the Indonesian law of \"Personaliteit\", an Indonesian citizen who committed an offence overseas but was arrested in Indonesia should only be put on trial in Indonesia for the particular offence they committed outside their home country. However, a police spokesman Setyo Wasisto of the Indonesian National Police promised to fully cooperate with the Singaporean authorities to help them investigate the Bedok double murder, and the Singapore Police Force agreed with work together with the Indonesian police to solve the case. An extradition treaty in 2007 was signed by both Singapore and Indonesia but it was not yet ratified by the Indonesian parliament as of 2017, the year when Khasanah was arrested.\nOn the side of Indonesian law, an offence of murder carried a possible jail term of up to 20 years, life imprisonment or the death penalty by firing squad. A police spokesperson for the Indonesian police stated that Khasanah, who reportedly confessed to murdering Chia and Chin, was believed to have planned the murders and her actions could constitute as an offence of premeditated murder, and he believed Khasanah could possibly be jailed for 20 years or executed by firing squad under Indonesian law should she be convicted by the Central Jakarta District Court, where Khasanah's trial was scheduled to take place. The case of Khasanah's trial in Indonesia for a crime committed overseas brought renewed attention to the case of Harnoko Dewantoro, an Indonesian serial killer who was sentenced to death by an Indonesian court in 1995 for murdering his brother and two others over a business deal at Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Background of Khasanah ==\n\nBorn on 10 August 1976, Khasanah, also known as Ana Abdul Muis, was born as the sixth child in a family of eight children in Kebumen Regency in Central Java, Indonesia, although she went to school in Jakarta and also lived there. Khasanah married in 1996 and had four children - two sons and two daughters - before the couple divorced in 2011. Prior to 2017, Khasanah started working in Malaysia in 2008 for three years, and she first arrived in Singapore on 3 March 2017 to work as a maid for a Singaporean family, although Indonesian court documents showed that Khasanah was unhappy working for the family since she was subjected to verbal abuse on a daily basis. Khasanah endured it for two months until 6 May 2017, Khasanah threatened to jump from her employer's apartment if she did not allow her to resign, and her request was granted after the employer agreed to send her back to the maid agency. On 25 May 2017, Khasanah was employed as a maid for the second time in Singapore, after 79-year-old Chia Ngim Fong, who would become one of Khasanah's murder victims, hired her to work in their flat in Bedok Reservoir Road. At one point, Khasanah had started a chicken rice stall with a friend in Jakarta after working in Singapore for some time as a maid, but the business failed and she lost a lot of money, and she thus decided to return to Singapore to work in order to support her 16-year-old son.\n\n\n== Indonesian court process ==\nWith the efforts of both the Singaporean and Indonesian police organizations, Khasanah was charged with multiple counts of premeditated murder and theft, and she was brought to trial in an Indonesian court from 27 February to 2 May 2018. During the proceedings, investigating officers of the Singapore Police Force presented their investigative findings in court and there were also witnesses being summoned from Singapore to testify in Indonesia, some through video-link in court. Consequently, Khasanah was found guilty of the double murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, the second-highest punishment authorized by Indonesia for murder.\nIn the aftermath of her trial, Khasanah appealed to the Jakarta High Court, and on 15 August 2018, the court upheld Khasanah's conviction but reduced Khasanah's life term to 20 years' imprisonment, the third-highest penalty warranted for murder in Indonesia, but no reasons were given behind the reduction of Khasanah's sentence. Khasanah is presently serving her jail term at an Indonesian prison for the double murder since 2018, with her estimated release date would be latest in 2038.\n\n\n== Coroner's inquiry in Singapore ==\nOn 1 September 2020, three years after the Bedok double murders, the case was brought forward for hearing in a coroner's court in Singapore, which was presided over by State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam, an ex-prosecutor who formerly prosecuted Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion for murder; Contemplacion was sentenced to death and later hanged on 17 March 1995 for murdering a four-year-old boy and the boy's Filipino maid.\nDuring the coroner's inquiry, the full details of Khasanah's case were finally brought to light for the first time, some of which were from the Indonesian court documents of Khasanah's crime as shared by the Indonesian Supreme Court. The coroner's court was told that for nearly a month while she was employed by Chia Ngim Fong, Khasanah was dissatisfied and unhappy with working for the elderly couple. Additionally, Khasanah disliked Chia's wife Chin Sek Fah for scolding her. On 21 June 2017, after seeing her passport inside a cupboard she was cleaning inside Chia's bedroom, Khasanah decided to run away to Indonesia, and she was reportedly inspired by a movie, The Revenger Queen, to tie the couple up before making her escape. Khasanah made her first move by attacking Chia Ngim Fong, who was then inside the bedroom lying sideways on her bed, with his back facing Khasanah. Chia had his hands tied with raffia string and Khasanah tried to use duct tape to seal his mouth, but Chia shouted and to drown out his cries for help, Khasanah switched on the television and turned the volume high up, and she thus set upon Chia by hitting and punching Chia, until she saw Chia bleeding profusely on the face. According to Khasanah's statements, she panicked upon seeing the blood on Chia's face and in response, she grabbed a wooden stool and used it to repeatedly hit Chia on the head, until he no longer moved.\nAfter murdering Chia, Khasanah targeted Chin next, after Chin stumbled upon her husband's murder and confronted Khasanah soon after. Khasanah reportedly pushed down Chin, who fell down the floor, and Khasanah thus used raffia string to tie up Chin's limbs. Chin continually struggled even after she was bound to the towel railing in the bathroom, and so Khasanah held on to the bathroom sink and proceeded to repeatedly stomp onto Chin's body until she became motionless, before she left Singapore for Indonesia with her passport and the valuables she stole from the couple's flat. According to Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Mahathir Mohamad, who was in charge of the investigations by the Singaporean police, he testified that an autopsy on the victims confirmed that both Chin and Chia had died from blunt force trauma, and he also informed the coroner's court that Khasanah had been dealt with by the Indonesian judiciary for the double murders she committed in Singapore. ASP Mahathir also testified that the police found bloody fingerprints left by Khasanah in the master bedroom toilet in the flat and the DNA test confirmed that the blood belonged to Chia. Despite Khasanah's earlier claim that she fled Singapore without a passport, the records from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) confirmed that on the same date she murdered Chia and Chin, Khasanah indeed used a passport to leave Singapore via a ferry bound for Batam at the Harbourfront Cruise Centre.\nAfter a two-day hearing, on 2 September 2020, State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam recorded a verdict of murder, effectively finding Khasanah guilty of murdering both Chia Ngim Fong and Chin Sek Fah in absentia, even though it was not a formal conviction. State Coroner Kamala stated in her judgement that she was satisfied that based on the objective evidence presented in the coroner's court, the deaths of both Chia and his wife were part of an unlawful killing committed by Khasanah, since it was proven that Khasanah tied up the couple in order to stop them from hindering her plans to escape to Indonesia, before she mercilessly battered and stomped them to their deaths, and thereafter fled with her passport and some of the valuables from the couple's flat. State Coroner Kamala also offered her condolences to the deceased couple's surviving relatives, who were not present in court to hear the inquiry. At the time when the coroner's verdict was issued, the couple's son continued to live at the flat where his parents died.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of major crimes in Singapore\nLaw of Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abu Rafi' al-Qibti (Egyptian Arabic: ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿ±ÿßŸÅÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ®ÿ∑Ÿä; d. 40 AH/ 660 AD), formerly known as Aslam (ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ), was a mawla of prophet Muhammad. He is the founder of the Banu Abi Rafi' family.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nAbu Rafi' was a Copt. His name is disputed, with various accounts recording it as Ibrahim (Yahya ibn Ma'in), Aslam (Ibn 'Abd al-Barr), Sinan, Yasar, Saleh, Abd al-Rahman, Quzman, Yazid, Thabit, and Hormuz. Musab al-Zubairi said: His name is Ibrahim, and his nickname is Buryah, which is the diminutive of Ibrahim. His nickname dominated his name.\nMuhammad married him to Salma, his mawla, and she gave birth to Ubayd Allah bin Abi Rafi‚Äô. Salma was the midwife of Ibrahim, the Prophet's son, and witnessed Khaybar with him. Ubayd Allah bin Abi Rafi‚Äô was a treasurer and scribe for Ali bin Abi Talib.\nIn Asad al-Ghabah, Ibn al-Athir al-Jazari said ‚ÄúHe is a Copt. He belonged to Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, so he gave him to the Prophet, may God‚Äôs prayers and peace be upon him. It was said: He was a mawla of Sa'id ibn al-As, so his sons inherited from him, and they were eight, so they freed all of them except Khalid. He held on to his share of him, so the Messenger of God, may God‚Äôs prayers and peace be upon him, spoke to him to free his share, or sell him, or give him away, but he did not do so. Then the Messenger of God gave it to him, so he freed him. It was said: He freed three of them, so Abu Rafi‚Äô came to the Messenger of God, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, to seek his help against those who did not. He was freed, so the Messenger of God spoke to them about it, so they gave it to him, so he freed him. This is a different view, and the correct view: is that Abbas, may God bless him and grant him peace, so he gave him to the Prophet and he freed him. Abu Rafi‚Äô used to say: ‚ÄúI am the mawla of the Messenger of God,‚Äù and the nobles of Medina remained behind him.\"\n\n\n== Conversion to Islam ==\nHe converted to Islam in Mecca alongside Umm al-Fadl. They converted before the Battle of Badr, which he did not witness because he was residing in Mecca. Following the battle, Abu Rafi‚Äô migrated to Medina and stayed with Muhammad. He went on to witness the battles of Uhud and al-Khandaq, and the Islamic conquest of Egypt.\nSome sources mention that he immigrated to Abyssinia with Ja'far ibn Abi Talib.\n\n\n== Death ==\nThe time of his death varies. Some accounts say he died after the killing of Uthman, i.e. after 656. According to Al-Waqidi, Abu Rafi‚Äô died in Medina shortly before the killing of Uthman, while Ali ibn Makula said he died in the year A.H. forty (660 CE). Ibn Hibban said he died during the caliphate of Ali bin Abi Talib.\n\n\n== References ==",

On August 24, it was certified platinum in the United States for selling one million copies. This certification was granted by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Unlike the film, the soundtrack received favorable reviews and proved to be successful. Critics praised it for the selection of artists and its diversity.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\nThe Last Action Hero: Music from the Original Motion Picture soundtrack features twelve tracks. Some artists specifically wrote premiere compositions for it, including Big Gun by AC/DC, Real World by Queensr√øche, and Last Action Hero by Tesla. Real World was created based on suggestions from Michael Kamen, who was friends with the members of Queensr√øche and had previously collaborated with them on their debut album The Warning (1984) and the single Silent Lucidity (1990). Guitarist Michael Wilton admitted that: Kamen told us he wanted a real haunting ballad, but nothing too sentimental. He also said the song should start slow, then finally break loose and really hit hard. Meanwhile, Tommy Skeoch from Tesla argued that it was actually the third or fourth time we were asked to do a movie, but it finally worked out this time. When we got the call about the movie, I felt good about it from the start. We were already writing songs for our next album (Bust a Nut, 1994), but we thought, why not write a song, it's just the right scenario. We wrote it in an hour and a half.\nJerry Cantrell, the vocalist and guitarist of Alice in Chains, claimed that the band did not write the songs What the Hell Have I and A Little Bitter specifically for the movie. He said that we were working on 'What the Hell Have I' and 'A Little Bitter' when we were asked to contribute to the soundtrack, and we thought they would be perfect. We're really happy with both songs, especially since they were the first recordings we did with our new bass player, Mike Inez. The musicians recorded both songs in the spring of 1993 during a break in their concert tour promoting the album Dirt (1992). Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian admitted that the track Poison My Eyes came from the sessions for the band's sixth studio album Sound of White Noise (1993) ‚Äì When we were asked to do the soundtrack, we went back, changed the vocals again, and remixed the song. Then it sounded as good as everything on 'Sound of White Noise', so we knew it would be good for the soundtrack.\nThe composition Angry Again by Megadeth comes from the sessions for the band's fifth album, Countdown to Extinction (1992). Marty Friedman recalled: We didn't want to just make a 'one-off' movie song, so we took the opportunity to play another Megadeth track. We worked on 'Angry Again' with the mindset that it was as important as 'Symphony of Destruction' or 'Sweating Bullets'.\nWhile Def Leppard was busy touring, they sent a sketch of the song Two Steps Behind, which acoustic version had appeared on the B-side of the single Make Love Like a Man a year earlier. Kamen added orchestral strings to the composition. The track Swim had appeared a few weeks earlier on Fishbone's album Give a Monkey a Brain and He‚Äôll Swear He‚Äôs the Center of the Universe.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n\nThe first single promoting the soundtrack was Big Gun by AC/DC, released on May 24. The music video was directed by David Mallet, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger (dressed in a characteristic outfit inspired by a school uniform, a trademark of guitarist Angus Young's stage attire). The song was used in trailers promoting the film, as well as in TV and radio campaigns. Thanks to heavy rotation on MTV, Big Gun proved to be a success, becoming AC/DC's first song to top the Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart.\nReleasing the music video a month before the premiere of the film Last Action Hero (directed by John McTiernan) provided, according to Diarmuid Quinn, who was then Vice President of Marketing at Columbia Records, good promotion for both the soundtrack and the film. As part of further promotional efforts, four singles were released: Real World by Queensr√øche on May 31, What the Hell Have I by Alice in Chains on June 7, Angry Again by Megadeth on June 14, and Two Steps Behind by Def Leppard on August 24.\nThe premiere of Last Action Hero: Music from the Original Motion Picture took place on June 8. The album also included a live version of the song Dream On by Aerosmith, recorded during the MTV 10th Anniversary Special in 1991, where it was performed with an orchestra conducted by Kamen.\nExpanding the promotional campaign, Columbia and Sony partnered with the fast-food chain Burger King and the retail chain Musicland, which distributed tray liners with discount coupons for purchasing the album and other movie-related merchandise at Sam Goody, Musicland, and Suncoast stores.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical ===\n\nThe soundtrack, unlike the film, which received negative reviews, turned out to be a success. Jason Birchmeier from AllMusic rated the soundtrack 4.5 stars out of 5, arguing: The film soundtrack has significant lasting value, serving as a wonderful snapshot of the turbulent hard rock scene of the early '90s. The author pointed out that the greatest strength of the album is its diversity. Billboard magazine wrote that the soundtrack is a monstrous collection of the heaviest metal names, ergo a feast for rock listeners. The reviewer described the entire release as a powerful package, unrivaled in star value and musical caliber.\nThe industry magazine Guitar School, which titled its article Last Guitar Heroes, wrote: When Columbia Pictures had to create the heaviest, most fierce, ass-kicking soundtrack the size of Arnold Schwarzenegger for their blockbuster hit, 'Last Action Hero', they called upon the world's best guitarists: Angus Young of AC/DC, who can spit out killer riffs like Jack Slater fires 9mm bullets; Marty Friedman, who can play with such incredible speed that compared to him, the chase scenes from the movie 'Raw Deal' (1986, dir. John Irvin) look like a walk in the park; Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, who can make his Gibson Les Paul sound heavier than the solid titanium skeleton of the Terminator.\nMichael Christopher, in his extensive article dedicated to the soundtrack, wrote that looking back on it today, it's an interesting mix, but upon its release, it was the sonic embodiment of a changing musical landscape. It was a time when Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Megadeth, and Cypress Hill made sense to be part of the same tracklist. When it comes to rock, grunge, metal, and where hip-hop intersects, the boundaries blurred.\n\n\n=== Commercial ===\nOn 26 June 1993, the soundtrack debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200 chart, making a \"hot debut\". By July 10, it had risen to the 7th position. Besides the United States, it also reached the 7th spot on the New Zealand Top 40 Albums Chart. On August 10, after reaching the threshold of 500,000 copies sold in the United States, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Two weeks later, on August 24, the album surpassed one million copies sold, earning it a platinum certification from the RIAA. All five singles achieved placements in the top 25 of Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\n=== Listings ===\nIn 2014, Jennifer Wood from the Rolling Stone ranked the soundtrack in the 20 Soundtracks to Bad Movies list. In her explanation, the author acknowledged that Arnold Schwarzenegger lacked acting talent, which, in her opinion, was one of the reasons why John McTiernan's long-awaited post-postmodernist approach to He-Man action movies failed at the box office. Wood positively evaluated the soundtrack, stating that it managed to surpass the source material reminiscent of a flop, thanks to songs by artists such as Alice in Chains, AC/DC, Def Leppard, Cypress Hill, Fishbone, Anthrax, and Aerosmith.\n\n\n== Track list ==\n\n\n== Staff ==\nBased on source material:\n\n\n=== Production ===\nExecutive Producer: Don Ienner\nMastering: Eddy Schreyer at Future Disc, Hollywood\n\n\n=== Graphic design ===\nDesign: Doug Erb\nArt Director: Mary Maurer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Certifications ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLast Action Hero: Music from the Original Motion Picture in the AllMusic database.",

        "content": "Fran√ßois de Calvo, comte de Calvo, baptized in Barcelona on July 28, 1625, and died in Deinze on May 29, 1690, was a French gentleman and soldier of Catalan origin in the 17th century. Born into a good Catalan family, he chose to join the French army at a time when the Reaper War was raging. After serving for a time in the infantry, he switched to the cavalry, becoming captain of the Aguilar cavalry regiment in 1647. He raised a regiment and became a mestre de camp in 1654.\nA remarkable soldier, Calvo took part in all the campaigns of Louis XIV's reign, notably in Catalonia and Holland. He was promoted to brigadier in the king's armies in 1674. A general esteemed by the king for his efficiency, he was finally made lieutenant-general of the armies in 1676 following his intrepid defense of Maastricht. He was made a knight of the king's orders shortly before he died in 1688.\n\n\n== Family origins ==\nFran√ßois de Calvo Gualbes was born in Barcelona, not Soldeu in Andorra, as some authors claim. He was baptized on July 28, 1625, in the church of Saints-Just-et-Pasteur in Barcelona under the name Joan Salvador de Calv√≥ i Gualbes. At his confirmation, he took the first name Fran√ßois. He was the son of don Josep de Calvo, the second of the name, and do√±a Jer√≥nima de Gualbes, his wife. He was a Catalan gentleman from a prestigious family whose ancestors commanded the defense of Barcelona against Moorish raids on several occasions, notably when Almanzor sacked the city in 985. He also counts Almogavres among his ancestors.\nHis father, Josep de Calvo i Puigesteve, honorary citizen of Barcelona, was a doctor of law, a member of the Council of Aragon and the Royal Audience of Catalonia, and was elected military consul in 1640, along with Aloisio Roca. His nobility was confirmed when he was admitted to the Corts Catalanes on May 14, 1622, and, as such, recorded in the Green Book of the Military Order of Catalonia. His mother descended from a powerful family of Barcelona nobility, which provided the city with a large number of chief councilors.\nFran√ßois de Calvo has an older sister and two younger brothers: J√©romine, Joseph, and Pierre. The first married Rapha√´l Antich. The second was also a soldier. The third was an ecclesiastic: he was made abbot of Notre-Dame d'Eu by Louis XIV when the siege of Maastricht was lifted in 1676 thanks to the exploits of his brother Fran√ßois; Pierre de Calvo was also honorary councilor to the sovereign council of Roussillon and archdeacon of Elne. His nephew, Beno√Æt de Calvo Bassedes, son of Joseph, became colonel of the Royal Regiment and brigadier in 1693.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Rallying to France ===\nSince the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, Castilian soldiers have been omnipresent in Catalonia, and the local population has had a relatively difficult time of it. In 1640, the Catalans revolted against their legitimate sovereign, the King of Spain. Fran√ßois de Calvo, still a teenager, witnessed this great upheaval. By 1641, the traditional Catalan elite could no longer control the peasants' revolt: unable to stabilize the situation and faced with the advance of Castilian troops, they appealed to France. Richelieu immediately seized the opportunity to weaken Philip IV of Spain. After the victory at Montju√Øc, the Calvos, like many Catalan aristocrats, sided with France. Fran√ßois de Calvo was no exception and, despite his young age, offered his services to the new French governor of Catalonia, Joseph de Margarit, Marquis d'Aguilar. From then on, he faithfully served the Most Christian King.\n\n\n=== Reaper War ===\nCalvo began his career with the troops of Marshal de la Mothe. He took part in the storming of Tamarit in 1642, and the rescue operations at Flix, Miravet, and Cadaqu√©s in 1643. He was part of the army that raised the siege of L√©rida in 1644 and witnessed the bitter defeat that cost Marshal de la Mothe his post as Viceroy of Catalonia. Under the command of Comte d'Harcourt, he took part in the battles of Llorens and Balaguer in 1645 and the siege of L√©rida in 1646. He earned his captain's stripes in the Margarit cavalry regiment when it was created on January 6, 1647. Under the orders of the Grand Cond√©, he served in the attack on L√©rida and the siege of Tortosa in 1647. In 1648, as a reward for his services and loyalty to the King of France, the barony of Calonge - including, in addition to the town, the lands of Vall-llobrega and Vila-rom√† - was detached from the county of Palam√≥s for him. Calvo proved to be a brilliant officer, and on October 14, 1651, Marshal de la Mothe obtained the rank of marshal de camp for him from the court. Calvo was judged to be too close to Margarit, and on January 3, 1652, the patent was revoked, officially on the complaints of senior officers who had not yet obtained the rank. A man close to Josep d'Ardena, Margarit's political rival, was appointed in his place.\nHe played an active role in the defense of Barcelona in 1652, but after the victory of the Spanish forces, he watched helplessly as French domination of Catalonia came to an end. To compensate for the loss of his Catalan properties, on June 18, 165313, he was given the possessions of Antoine de Perapertusa, Viscount of Joch, a Roussillon supporter of Spain who had fled to Barcelona. He did not lose hope, however, and continued to resist the Spanish troops, managing to dissuade them from laying siege to Roses in the summer of 1653. He proved his courage during the siege of Gerona and the battle of Bordilly. On March 13, 1654, he obtained from the king the right to raise a cavalry regiment in his name and became mestre de camp. With his new regiment, he took part in several military campaigns in Catalonia and Conflent, including the battles of Villefranche-de-Conflent, Puycerda, Cadaqu√©s and Castellon. He remained in this post until peace was restored in 1659 with the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary War ===\nHis regiment was disbanded on July 20, 1660. Retaining his company as Mestre de camp, he served for a time in Italy and, in 1664, was one of the French troops sent by Louis XIV to help the Holy Roman Empire in Hungary against the Turks. He took part in the Battle of Saint-Gothard, where he once again distinguished himself by his bravery3. His regiment was re-established on December 7, 1665, to commemorate his action, and he was made a brigadier in the king's armies by a patent dated May 12, 1667.\nThe War of Devolution broke out a few days later, and Calvo was placed under the command of Marshal d'Aumont. They successfully advanced into Flanders, taking the town of Bergues on June 6 and Furnes six days later. He is dispatched to support the King, who lays siege to Tournai. After that, he took part in the conquests of Courtrai and Audenarde in July. He also took part in the conquest of Franche-Comt√© once the Flanders campaign was over. With the return of peace, his regiment was disbanded again on May 24, 1668, but the king retained his company of mestre de camp. His regiment was definitively re-established on August 9, 1671, and he was created visitor of the cavalry on November 6.\n\n\n=== Dutch War ===\n\nIn 1672, he accompanied the king on the Dutch campaign. Fearless, he was one of the first to cross the Rhine. The king took a liking to him and made him governor of Arnhem on September 8, 1672. He took part in all the sieges that the king carried out in person. He spent the winter in the province of Utrecht and contributed to the lifting of the siege of Woerden and the capture of Bodegraven.\nIn 1673, he served under the Prince de Cond√©, then the Duke of Luxembourg, with whom he captured Maastricht. In 1674, at the battle of Seneffe, he distinguished himself by his bravery. Louis XIV said on this occasion: \"I have four men whom my enemies respect: Montal, Chamilly, Calvo and Dufay\". He also marched to the rescue of Oudenaarde. Seconded by Marshal d'Estrades, Governor of Maastricht, he laid siege to and took the town of Saint-Vith, making a substantial haul and dismantling the place in six hours. In early 1675, he was employed in Lorraine under the Marquis de Rochefort. He was definitively made mar√©chal de camp by patent of April 2, 1675.\nHe moved to the Flanders army in May and was stationed in Dinant, Huy, and Limbourg. On July 30, 1675, he was appointed commander of Maastricht, in the absence of Marshal d'Estrades, who was in Nijmegen. Fran√ßois de Calvo had become famous among his contemporaries for his remarkable defense of Maastricht in 1676. From then on, the king placed great trust in his general: \"I was without fear when he [Calvo] defended a place\", he is reported to have said. Locking himself in the city, the general said: \"Gentlemen, I hear nothing of defending a place; all I know is that I don't want to surrender\". Indeed, he did not surrender and, for over two months, defended the town with such ardor - the French made a sortie every day, and General de Calvo was at his men's side - against the forces of the Prince of Orange that the latter was forced to lift the siege on August 27, as Marshal de Schomberg's troops approached. Louis XIV, recognizing his merit and deeply satisfied with his general, made him governor of Aire on August 29 and lieutenant-general of his armies on August 30. He was awarded a pension of twenty thousand livres on September 12.\nHe remained in command of Maastricht until the city was returned to the Dutch and made several forays to keep the enemy at bay, as in May 1678, when he captured the town of Leeuw and took over four hundred prisoners, including thirty-five officers.\nOn March 25, 1679, when Frederick William I of Brandenburg refused to sign the peace treaty, Calvo was ordered to ravage the duchies of Cleves and Juliers. He captured Cleves and the surrounding country. He was then employed in the Army of the Rhine, under the command of Marshal de Cr√©quy. He again distinguished himself by his courage at the crossing of the Weser near Minden on June 30, 1679.\n\n\n=== Meeting War ===\nIn 1684, the King's service led him to return to Catalonia. Having swum across the Ter, he charged the Spanish lines beyond the Pont-Major and almost took their general, the Duc de Bournonville, prisoner; but the night forced him to be cautious and he preferred to withdraw. He took Gerona alongside Marshal de Bellefonds.\n\n\n=== League of Augsburg War ===\nWar having resumed in 1688, against the Spanish and their allies, he served in the Flanders army, under Marshal d'Humi√®res. On December 31, 1688, the king made him a knight of his orders and sent him, on May 24, 1689, at the head of a corps of five thousand men, to defend the northern frontier of the kingdom, threatened by twenty thousand Spanish and Dutch soldiers.\n\n\n== Death and posterity ==\nHe died of a fluxion of the chest in Deinze on May 29, 1690, aged 64, and is buried in Aire, where he was governor. Fran√ßois de Calvo remains a little-known general under Louis XIV, as journalist Fernand Sendra notes in an article: ‚ÄúFran√ßois de Calvo, Andorran [sic] and a great servant of the armies of France, ‚Äòle brave Calvo‚Äô, does he not deserve to be remembered? ‚Äù.\n\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n\n== Marriage and descendants ==\nOn May 7, 1644, he married Marie de Margarit, daughter of Philippe de Margarit and B√©atrice de Gallart, his second wife. Marie de Margarit is also the consanguine sister of Joseph de Margarit, Marquis d'Aguilar. They had no children.\nHowever, Fran√ßois de Calvo had a natural son, Fran√ßois de Calvo. The latter held several important positions, including advocate general to the Sovereign Council of Roussillon. On June 26, 1691, he married Mancia Maduxer in the Saint-Jean church in Perpignan, who gave him a daughter named Marie. He obtained letters of legitimation from the king in July 1699.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nA formidable man of war, Calvo had a reputation among his contemporaries for being implacable with his enemies and an excellent administrator. Loyal to the King of France and devoted to Louvois, it was on his orders that he ravaged the country of Li√®ge in 1676, while the French army was besieged in Maastricht. Paillerolles, a diplomat sent by Pomponne to Maastricht, describes General de Calvo as a cold soldier, cruelly lacking in humanity.\nOne of his biographers describes him as ‚Äúthe finest and bravest man in the army‚Äù. Fran√ßois de Calvo was courageous and intrepid; a true commander, he did not hesitate to pay with his person, ‚Äúhe was of the temperament of the Catinats and Turennes, minus the birth ‚Äù.\n\nCalvo had a passion for horses, and it was not uncommon to find them in his stable, which was one of the most remarkable of its time, so much so that the greatest draughtsmen took his horses as models. The general called his horse ‚Äúmy heart‚Äù and lavished great care on it. There's an anecdote to this effect: when Louis XIV wanted to express his esteem for Calvo and his talents in person, the king remarked on the beauty of his mount and said to the general:‚ÄúCalvo, let's change; you won't lose anything at the exchange.\n- Sire, resumed the soldier, if Your Majesty asks me for my wife, I'll give her to you, but leave me my heart!\n- Stinking belly interrupts the king, your wife has no teeth!\n\n- Sire, replies Calvo, when a horse is given, you don't look at your mouth.\"The king bursts out laughing, embraces Calvo and immediately reassures him that his request was only a joke. This remark has since become a saying: ‚ÄúYou shouldn't find fault with a present you receive‚Äù.\n\n\n== Service records ==\nJanuary 6, 1647: Captain in the Aguilar cavalry regiment;\nMarch 13, 1654: mestre de camp in the Calvo cavalry regiment;\nMay 12, 1667: brigadier in the king's armies;\nApril 2, 1675: Marshal of Camp;\nAugust 30, 1676: lieutenant-general of the king's armies.\n\n\n== Titles ==\nComte de Calvo;\nBaron de Calonge (1648).\n\n\n== Ornaments ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nChevalier des ordres du roi (11th promotion, Versailles, December 31, 1688);\nChevalier du Saint-Esprit;\nChevalier de Saint-Michel.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nReapers' War\nSiege of Maastricht (1676)\n54th Infantry Regiment (France)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMor√©ri, Louis (1718).

Its name derives from the Greek personal name  ŒìŒµŒΩŒΩŒ¨Œ¥ŒπœÇ < ŒìŒµŒΩŒΩŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒøœÇ (Gennadios).\nDuring the Crusader-period, it was known as \"Casal of Gendas\", mentioned in a Latin charter dated 1129 CE. Jisr Jindas, named after the village, is the most famous of the several bridges erected by Sultan Baybars in Palestine, which include the Yibna and the Isdud Bridges.\nJindƒÅs is mentioned in the 15th and 16th centuries as a flourishing village whose lands belonged to different religious endowments.\nIn 1552 Haseki H√ºrrem Sultan, the favorite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, endowed a quarter of the tax revenues of Jindas to its Haseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem. Administratively, the village belonged to District of Gaza.\nIn 1597 Jindas was home to 35 adult males. The villagers paid a fixed  tax rate of 33.3% for the crops that they cultivated, which included wheat, barley, as well as on other types of property, such as goats and beehives, a total of 5,372 akce, all paid to waqfs.\nIn 1051 AH/1641/2, the Bedouin tribe of al-SawƒÅlima from around Jaffa attacked the villages of Sub·π≠ƒÅra, Bayt Dajan, al-SƒÅfiriya, JindƒÅs, Lydda and YƒÅz≈´r belonging to Waqf Haseki Sultan.\nThe desertion of Jindas in the 17th or early 18th century, as well as of its neighbors villages like Kafr Jinnis, reflects the unsettled conditions around Lydda as a result from the migrations of nomadic groups and local manifestations of the Qays and Yaman rivalry.\nJindas was resettled in the 19th century, but was abandoned before the end of the century. The inhabitants of JindƒÅs were scattered throughout Palestine's central hill country. The lands of Jindas were cultivated by the inhabitants of Beit Nabala and Lydda. Roy Marom has shown how, starting in 1878, the lands became the target of early Zionist settlement initiatives but Ottoman reassertion of Jindas‚Äô status as a waqf estate forestalled the land acquisition initiatives.\nJindas' name was adopted by Lydda's urban-renewal agency.[1]\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The battle of Ber took place between August 11 and 12, 2023, between the Malian Armed Forces and the Wagner Group against fighters of the Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) and Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM). The battle was the first major confrontation between the CMA and Malian forces since the signing of the Algiers Accords, and led to the breakdown of the accords by late 2023.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2023, tensions between the Malian junta led by Assimi Go√Øta that took charge in 2021 and Tuareg rebel groups that were signatories of the Algiers Accords in 2015 rose dramatically. On the night between August 4 and 5, CMA fighters were attacked in Fooita, near L√©r√©. The CMA released a statement deploring the deaths of two of their fighters, and accused Malian forces and the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group of perpetrating the attack. The Malian government and Wagner did not respond to the accusation. On August 10, CMA representatives left Bamako.\nFollowing a request by the Malian junta on June 30, 2023, the United Nations Security Council terminated the mandate of MINUSMA, the UN peacekeeping force that had been in Mali since the beginning of the Mali War. MINUSMA peacekeepers began to leave Malian military bases in the months that followed. In Ber, the evacuation of the MINUSMA camp angered local CMA fighters due to the still-present threat of Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) jihadists. On June 9, a JNIM attack at the MINUSMA base killed two Burkinabe peacekeepers and seven others. In response, the CMA prevented Malian forces from taking control of the MINUSMA base in Ber.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\nAt the beginning of August, a column of eighty Malian vehicles crossed the city of Timbuktu with Wagner Group militants. By August 11, the convoy was en route to Ber, fifty-six kilometers away. On the way, the Malian troops fell into an ambush conducted by JNIM, sparking clashes that lasted for over an hour. Parts of the Russo-Malian column took a different route to reach Ber, and arrived at a CMA position bordering a red line established between Mali and the CMA in 2014 around ten kilometers outside the city. Clashes broke out around the red line, and the Malian Army retreated. The CMA published a press release claiming to have repelled the Malian and Wagner forces, and denounced a \"violation of ll arrangements and security commitments.\" The Malian Army reported clashes with \"terrorists\", but did not mention the CMA.\nFighting began the next day northwest of the city. The Malian Air Force launched airstrikes against Ber, while the Burkinabe peacekeepers discreetly evacuated the MINUSMA camp three days before the deadline. Malian forces seized control of the MINUSMA camp in the afternoon of August 12, while CMA fighters retreated deeper into the city. Over the coming days, Malian forces enacted control over the entirety of Ber.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Casualties ===\nThe Malian Army released a statement claiming that the fighting left one Malian soldier dead and four others injured on August 11 and six dead and four injured on August 12. The junta claimed that the \"armed terrorist groups\" left four bodies on August 11 and twenty-four bodies on August 12, along with eighteen AK-47 rifles and twelve motorcycles. The communique also claimed the destruction of three vehicles during the airstrikes.\nJNIM released a statement on August 12 claiming to have attacked Malian and Wagner forces, acknowledging the deaths of four jihadists and claiming to have caused \"dozens of deaths and injuries\" among the Malian and Wagner troops, along with the capture of a Malian soldier. In the statement, JNIM added photos of captured Malian equipment. \nThe CMA released a statement claiming to have confronted Malian and Wagner forces, but did not take any losses. In fighting on August 12, a resident of Ber testified to Lib√©ration that several civilians were injured and a CMA vehicle was destroyed in Ber, but the CMA did not suffer any casualties. MINUSMA reported the injuries of four peacekeepers during two attacks carried out on August 12.\n\n\n=== Renewed conflict ===\nThe battle of Ber further weakened the deteriorating Algiers Agreement. The CMA threatened to launch a counterattack to capture the MINUSMA camp in Ber following the Malian seizure. Negotiations between the CMA and Malian junta had already been at a standstill prior to the battle; neither side was interested in disrupting the status quo for years. The Malian junta, however, had made the recapture of Mali's northern Kidal Region a priority.\nThe Malian Chief of Staff, Oumar Diarra, embarked on a tour of areas in Gao Region, Mopti Region, and Tombouctou Region, including the recently recaptured camp at Ber, between August 22 and 24. In early and mid-September, the CMA and the greater Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD) alliance launched attacks on Malian and Wagner forces at Bourem, L√©r√©, and Taoussa.\n\n\n== References ==",

Legu√≠a. In September of the same year, Antonio Mir√≥ Quesada went to live with his family in the United States due to the regime's actions against the newspapers El Comercio and La Prensa: both newspapers were burnt down by a crowd headed by Legu√≠a, as was Mir√≥ Quesada's personal residence. He remained between the U.S. and Europe until 1925. Upon his return, he refrained from participating in political activities. He was Plenipotentiary Minister of Peru in Belgium from 1933 to 1934.\n\n\n=== Murder ===\nOn May 15, 1935, Mir√≥ Quesada and his wife, Mar√≠a Laos Arg√ºelles de Mir√≥ Quesada, were murdered in the Plaza San Mart√≠n by 19-year-old Carlos Steer Lafont, leader of the Aprista Youth Federation. Mir√≥ Quesada left the El Comercio premises and went to the Gran Hotel Bol√≠var, where they were staying, to pick up his wife. They were both walking to lunch at the National Club, when, at 1:45 pm, while they were in front of the Teatro Col√≥n, Mir√≥ Quesada was shot three times, one in the middle of the back, the others in the back of the head and at the base of the skull. His wife tried to defend him and she confronted Steer with her purse, who shot her. The couple died instantly and Steer fled towards Jir√≥n Quilca, shooting himself non-fatally three times when surrounded and being sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEl Comercio (Peru)\n\n\n== References ==",

The cover features an illustration depicting Sarah Baartman.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFearing the Black Body was well received in academic circles. Positive reviews of the book were published by Meshell Sturgis in Lateral, Etsuko Taketani in The Journal of American History, and Amelia Earhart Serafine in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History.\nIn Social Forces, Laura Jennings praised the accessibility of Strings's prose and the depth of her research, but noted that Strings occasionally falsely conflated physically descriptive terms like \"obesity\" with behavioral terms such as \"gluttony.\" Jennings also noted that Strings's analysis of recent history is less extensive than her analysis of earlier centuries. In the European Journal of Women's Studies, Kathy Davis complimented the book's innovation, readability, and breadth, but expressed her wish that Strings had gone further in her analysis of the epidemiology of obesity as it relates to black women.\nThe book won the 2020 Sociology of Body and Embodiment Best Publication Award from the American Sociological Association.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alt Ter (Catalan pronunciation: [Ààa…´ t…õr]; English: Upper Ter) is a natural region and proposed vegueria by the Ter river in Catalonia.\nConsisting of the counties of Llu√ßan√®s, Osona and Ripoll√®s, it is part of the regions of Central Catalonia and Girona. with 191,534 inhabitants as of 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, the proposal to become a vegueria has been based on Region 6 of the division made during the Spanish Republic, which comprised Osona, Ripoll√®s and Baixa Cerdanya, following the Trans-Pyrenean Railway, with Vic as its seat. In 2003, a platform for the vegueria of Alt Ter was created, encompassing Osona and Ripoll√®s (and Garrotxa in some instances).\nIn 2023, the municipalities of the counties of Bages and Osona were integrated into the new county of Llu√ßan√®s, thus making up part of the Alt Ter vegueria proposal.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region's most populous settlements are Vic, Manlleu, Roda de Ter, Torell√≥, Ripoll, Ribes de Freser, Prats de Llu√ßan√®s and Camprodon.\n\n\n=== Mountains ===\n\nTo the north of Alt Ter, specifically Ripoll√®s, lies a set of massifs and mountain ranges of the Pyrenees with high peaks: the Creu de Maians (2,020 m), the Puigmal (2,909.8 m), the Pic de Finestrelles (2,827 m), Pic d'Eina (2,789 m), Pic de Noufonts (2,861 m), Pic de l'Infern (2,869 m), Bastiments (2,881 m), Pic de la Dona (2,702 m), Costabona (2,465 m), and Montfalgars (1,610.8 m), all on the line of the border with Northern Catalonia in France.\nFurther south, there is another mountain range, parallel to the previous one. To the west of this range lies the Montgrony chain and to the east the Serra Cavallera chain (Taga, 2,039.9 m).\nFurther south, there are other mountain ranges running parallel to the previous ones, all part of the Pyrenees. To the south-west are the Tubau lowlands and the Serra de Matamala mountain range. To the south-east, there is a group of mountain ranges that come into contact with the Transversal Range: the Milany and Santa Magdalena ranges and Puigsacalm (1,514 m), on the border with Garrotxa.\nIn Osona county, to the north, lies the Serra de Bellmunt, home to Bellmunt mountain (1,247 m). In the north-western part of the region, in Collsacabra sub-county, lies the Serra de Cabrera, home to the Cabrera mountain (1,308 m).\nBetween Osona and Llu√ßan√®s counties lie mountains such as Miranda (911 m), Tur√≥ de la Creu de Gurb (842 m), home to the Gurb castle, and Santa Ll√∫cia de Sobremunt (958 m).\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nFont i Garolera, Jaume (2003).

Its name derives from the Greek personal name ŒìŒµŒΩŒΩŒ±·øñŒøœÇ/ ŒìŒ≠ŒΩŒΩŒπŒøœÇ  (‚Äúhigh-born, noble\").\nIn 1552, Haseki H√ºrrem Sultan, the favourite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, endowed a quarter of the tax revenues of Kafr Jinnis to its Haseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem. Like neighnboring Jindas, the village belonged administratively to District of Gaza.\nIn 1597, Kafr Jinnis was home to 18 adult males. The villagers paid a fixed  tax rate of 33,3% for the crops that they cultivated, which included wheat, barley, as well as on other types of property, such as goats and beehives, a total of 8,600 akce, all paid to a waqf.\nDuring the era of the British Mandate for Palestine, Kafr Jinnis railway station was built by the British military as part of a branch of the Eastern Railway to Al-Lubban during the Sinai and Palestine campaign of World War I; Kafr Jinnis was where the branch diverged from the Eastern Railway proper (see: Airport City railway station).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harpenden Town Hall is a municipal building in Leyton Road in Harpenden, a town in Hertfordshire, in England. It accommodates the offices and meeting place of Harpenden Town Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Park Hall ===\n\nThe oldest part of the complex is Park Hall which was commissioned by the British and Foreign School Society as the Harpenden British School. The site was donated by the entrepreneur and agricultural scientist, Sir John Lawes, who lived at Rothamsted Manor.\nThe building was designed in the English vernacular style, built in red brick and was completed in 1850. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of six bays facing onto Leyton Road. The ground floor was projected forward as a lean-to with a recessed doorway, flanked by banded pilasters supporting a segmental-headed arch, in the fourth bay. The other bays were fenestrated by casement windows. On the first floor, there was a wide gable containing a segmental-headed window flanked by decorative half-timbered quatrefoils and other carvings with a stucco infill.\nFollowing the implementation of the Elementary Education Act 1870, the school became a Board School and, in 1897, the school relocated to a more substantial building in Victoria Road. After moving again, to Manland Common, it evolved to become the Sir John Lawes School. Following significant population growth, largely associated with the straw plaiting and brewing industries, an urban district council was formed in the area in 1898. The old school in Leyton Road was acquired by the new council later in 1898 and re-opened as the \"Public Hall\" in September 1899, acting as the council's meeting place and offices as well as a public events venue.\nThe building remained the local seat of government until the council relocated to Harpenden Hall in Southdown Road in 1931. The building on Leyton Road, which became known as \"Park Hall\", continued to be used as a community events venue and served as the local Air Raid Precautions headquarters during the Second World War.\nFollowing local government re-organisation in 1974, the enlarged St Albans District Council took ownership of Park Hall. The building subsequently became dilapidated and, in the 1980s, it was proposed that the building be demolished: however the district council placed an conservation order on the building and agreed to lease it to Harpenden Town Council.\n\n\n=== The town hall ===\nIn the early 1990s, the town council decided to refurbish Park Hall and to commission a new building at the rear of the original building to function as a town hall. The new building, which faced onto the side road to the northwest of Park Hall, was designed in a similar style as the original building and built in red brick. The whole complex was officially re-opened by the Secretary of State for Social Security, Peter Lilley, on 8 October 1994. The town council relocated from Harpenden Hall to the new town hall in August 1996.\nWorks of art in the town hall include a painting by Frank O. Salisbury entitled \"Lady in Red\". The painting was intended to depict the actress in the role of Katherina in William Shakespeare's play, The Taming of the Shrew.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Harpenden Town Hall at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Itimpi Solar Power Station is a 60 megawatts solar power plant in Zambia. The privately owned solar farm was commissioned in April 2024. It was developed and is owned by Copperbelt Energy Corporation (CEC), through their 100 percent subsidiary CEC Renewables. CEC transmits and distributes the power to its customers in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station is located on a piece of property measuring 80 hectares (200 acres), approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi), north of the central business district of the city of Kitwe. Kitwe is approximately 358 kilometres (222 mi) north of Lusaka, the national capital.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis solar farm is the second photovoltaic solar installation in Kitwe District, owned by CEC. The other solar power station is the 34 megawatts Zambia Riverside Solar Power Station that was commissioned in 2023.\nThe design calls for a ground-mounted solar panel layout, with 109,144 \"bifacial monocrystalline solar modules\" arranged in rows along tracking devices which rotate the modules to maximize exposure to the rays of the sun at all times. The power generated  here is fed through 200 inverters and into the CEC electricity grid for transmission and distribution to end-users. The capacity output is planned at 60 MW, with 130 GWh of annual output.\n\n\n== Construction costs and timeline ==\nThe construction costs for the power station are reported as US$53 million, funded by a portion of the $200 million green bond listed by CEC on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. In April 2024, the completed 60 MW solar farm was officially commissioned by Hakainde Hichilema, the Zambian Head of State. During construction an estimated 1,200+ skilled and unskilled jobs were created.\n\n\n== Other considerations ==\nAs of April 2024, Zambia had installed generation capacity of 3,030 MW, of which 2,393 MW (79 percent) was derived from hydroelectric sources. Due to severe drought in the sub-region in recent months, the river levels are low and Zambian electricity output is low. As of February 2024, Zambia was grappling with a 500 MW deficit in electricity supply. This solar farm helps to partially mitigate that shortage.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of power stations in Zambia\nZambia Riverside Solar Power Station\nZESCO\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website of Copperbelt Energy Corporation",

        "content": "Carlos Mir√≥ Quesada Laos (Lima; October 19, 1903 ‚Äî Brussels; November 4, 1969) was a Peruvian journalist, politician and diplomat.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Lima on October 19, 1903, he was the son of Antonio Mir√≥ Quesada de la Guerra and Mar√≠a Laos Arg√ºelles. His father, a renowned politician and journalist, was president of Congress and director of El Comercio. He completed his school studies at the  Inmaculada School in Lima and at the Tome School in Maryland, and completed higher education at the universities of Oxford, La Sorbonne and San Marcos, graduating as a lawyer in Lima (1932).\nIn 1936, he married Rosa Moreyra y Paz-Sold√°n, with whom he had an only daughter. Later, he had two more daughters with Beatriz Eguren Carranza.\nIn 1921, he joined El Comercio, being director of its evening edition from 1928 to 1934 (with an interruption in 1929 when he was confined in San Lorenzo by the government of Augusto B. Legu√≠a). The following year, both of his parents were murdered in an attack perpetrated by an Aprista Party leader, so the general direction of the newspaper passed to his uncle Aurelio Mir√≥ Quesada, while the sub-directorship went to him. Considered one of the main defenders and propagandists of fascism in his country, he was deported by the government of √ìscar R. Benavides in 1937, so he remained in Europe, travelling through Western Europe until the departure of the military regime in 1940.\nIn 1944, he founded the conservative party with an anti-APRA tendency Renovaci√≥n Nacional, which had a medium political presence and from which he ran for senator for Callao in 1945. This year he moved to Argentina, where he remained three years dedicated to academic and journalistic activities as a collaborator of La Naci√≥n and Clar√≠n in Buenos Aires, and El Mercurio in Chile.\nIn 1949, he entered the diplomatic service and the military government of Manuel A. Odr√≠a appointed him ambassador to Chile, a position in which he remained until 1952, when he was transferred to the Peruvian embassy in Mexico. From this position he intervened in the resumption of diplomatic relations between Peru and Costa Rica, for which he was sent on a special mission to this country and then to Nicaragua. In 1953, he was appointed ambassador in Rio de Janeiro, a position he held until 1954 when he irrevocably resigned due to Odr√≠a's decision to allow V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre to leave the country. In 1956, he declined his candidacy for the presidency of Peru.\nUpon his return to Lima, he joined the conspiracy to place General Zen√≥n Noriega Ag√ºero in the government, but when the plot was discovered, he took refuge in the Brazilian embassy and then went into exile to Chile. In 1956, with the military regime severely deteriorating, Odr√≠a allowed the return of his political enemies and called for general elections. In them, Mir√≥-Quesada presented himself as a National Restoration candidate for the Presidency with the intention of later withdrawing his nomination in favor of Manuel Prado and making the anti-APRA vote more solid; However, Prado, unsure of his victory, allied himself with Apra, so Mir√≥-Quesada immediately withdrew his support. In 1962, he supported the candidacy of Fernando Bela√∫nde against that of Haya and in the same way in 1963.\nFrom 1963 to 1966, he was Peru's ambassador to Belgium and then to Italy until 1968 when he resigned due to the government's decision to apologise to Armando Villanueva, president of the Chamber of Deputies whom he had refused to receive in Rome. After Bela√∫nde's fall, Juan Velasco Alvarado's military government restored him as ambassador to Italy (1969) and then again to Belgium (April‚ÄìNovember 1969). Mir√≥-Quesada died on November 4, 1969, in a hospital in Brussels, two weeks after suffering a vehicle accident.\nIn 2016, his grandson Jos√© Carlos Yrigoyen published his biography titled Orgullosamente solos (Proudly alone), in which he details his relationships with fascism, as well as his post-war political career.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Scott Lamb (born 28 October 1966) is a former motorcycle speedway rider from Scotland.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLamb, born in Edinburgh, began his British leagues career riding for Berwick Bandits during the 1985 National League season. However, he was part of the exchange deal with Edinburgh Monarchs, that saw Scott Courtney head for Berwick, with Phil Jeffrey and Lamb heading in the other direction.\nThe following season in 1986 he became a regular at Powderhall Stadium operating from the reserve berth. During the next five seasons he gradually improved his average, hitting a high in 1989 of 6.16.\nBefore the 1991 season got underway, Newcastle Diamonds signed Lamb and he experienced his best season to date recording 7.32 for the season and helping Newcastle seal third spot in the league standings. Despite the good season, he returned to his first club Berwick for 1992, after refusing deals offered by both Newcastle and Edinburgh.\nHis best season was to come in 1993, when he was once again an Edinburgh rider. He was part of the four that won the Fours championship final, held at the East of England Arena on 25 July 1993. His popularity grew with the Monarchs fans and he recorded a 7.85 season average in 1994 and enjoyed two consistent seasons in the top league during 1995 and 1996.\nLamb returned to Berwick in 1997 and would race for five seasons with them before ending his career in 2001. \nAfter retiring he went into coaching, taking charge of the Mildenhall Fen Tigers in 2002. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Empire Airlines was a small jet carrier serving mainly New York and adjacent states with the stated aim to be ‚Äúchief airline for the Empire State‚Äù. Empire was a small but notable deregulation success, pulling itself up by its bookstraps and achieving industry recognition. Empire stayed break-even or better, despite aggressive competition by much larger and/or better capitalized airlines, the turbulence of the early deregulation era and many years of substantial expansion. The airline achieved annual revenues of about $90mm (over $250mm in 2024 dollars) before accepting a purchase offer from Piedmont Airlines in October 1985. The transaction closed in early 1986 and after a brief period, Empire merged into Piedmont. Piedmont itself merged into USAir in 1989 which, many years later, bought American Airlines in 2015.\nFounded by Paul Quackenbush, Empire Airlines began with a base at Oneida County Airport serving the Utica-Rome metropolitan area. Empire leveraged the withdrawal of legacy airlines from Upstate New York and the collapse of other new-entrant competitors. It tapped capital markets frequently to finance expansion. It innovated: Empire‚Äôs codeshare with Pan Am at New York Kennedy Airport was cited by former American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall as the first such international codeshare. This not only brought incremental traffic to Empire, but helped set it apart from other small carriers at a time when the Pan Am name still meant something. Empire expanded throughout the early 1980s to destinations throughout New York State, most adjacent states, Maryland, Washington DC and Ottawa and Montreal in Canada with a final fleet of 15 Fokker F28 jets.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early days and certification ===\nThe airline was incorporated as Oneida County Aviation, Inc. in late 1974, a fixed base operator located at the now-closed Oneida County Airport, then the commercial airport serving the Utica-Rome metropolitan area. Paul Quackenbush invested $25,000 initially (over $150,000 in 2024 dollars), expanding the capital base in two rounds of private offerings in 1976 and 1977 for $160,000 and $250,000 respectively. The airline first flew as a Part 298 carrier, before getting its airline certificate from the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) on October 13, 1979 as Oneida County Aviation, Inc. dba Empire Airlines. However, the name of the company was by then already Empire Airlines, Inc. as of September 19, 1979 Empire leveraged the deregulation-driven pullout of Allegheny Airlines from parts of Upstate New York, like Utica.\nAs of the date of its CAB application (February 22, 1979) Empire‚Äôs fleet comprised three Swearingen Metros and three Piper Navajos. A fourth Metro joined the fleet by the time the certificate was issued, and a fifth arrived shortly thereafter. 58.6% of the company was owned by Paul Quackenbush, his sister and brother-in-law, Peter Hager, a partner at Goldman Sachs. The presence of a Goldman Sachs partner as a significant shareholder presumably helps explain the success the small airline had in the capital markets. The CAB certified Empire for Utica to Buffalo, Washington DC, and Boston, and, via Syracuse, to New York, Newark, NJ and Hartford, CT. Empire was also approved for Utica to Hartford via Albany, NY. \n\n\n=== Jet transition ===\nIn early 1980, Empire was just one of over a half-dozen turboprop operators in New York State trying to backfill for Allegheny and other bigger carriers in the wake of deregulation. What set Empire apart was that, CAB certification in hand, it immediately ordered two Fokker F28-4000 jets.. The first was put into service on September 15, 1980 between Utica and New York. Empire‚Äôs initial public offering of 150,000 shares at $6.50 on May 12, 1980 reinforced its balance sheet.\nIn 1981, American Airlines dumped short-haul Upstate New York routes like Buffalo and Rochester to New York, citing the widespread disruption caused by the air traffic controller strike of August 1981. This created opened further opportunity for Empire.\nEmpire frequently tapped the capital markets to finance expansion. In December 1981 it raised almost $5mm from the sale of 550,000 shares at $9/share. In January 1983, it raised another $2.9mm from the sale of 650,000 shares at $4.50 and went back to the markets in December of the same year to raise $3.75mm from the sale of 600,000 shares at $6.75.\n\n\n=== Cooperation and competition ===\nEmpire‚Äôs cooperation with Pan Am, dubbed ‚ÄúEmpire Pan Am Express,‚Äù started December 15, 1982 and initially included through ticketing, including Empire printing boarding passes for Pan Am flights and vice versa, as well as ability to earn miles on Pan Am‚Äôs frequent flyer program.. Code sharing started in 1983, according to Robert Crandall (see above). Quackenbush said that in 1984, 80,000 Empire passengers connected to/from Pan Am, a year in which Empire flew 1.07mm passengers total. Empire also participated in Northwest‚Äôs frequent flyer program on connecting tickets between Empire and Northwest.\nEmpire‚Äôs success garnered industry recognition: in early 1985, Empire was awarded Air Transport World‚Äôs ‚ÄúRegional Airline of the Year 1984.‚Äù Ironically, Piedmont Airlines won ‚ÄúAirline of the Year 1984‚Äù.\nApart from USAir, which despite having withdrawn from some New York State routes remained Empire‚Äôs main competition, Empire competed against aggressive and much larger deregulation startups such as People Express (which served routes like Newark to Buffalo and Rochester) and New York Air (which served Rochester to LaGuardia Airport). Turboprop competitors included the well-financed Brockway Air, owned by Brockway Glass, a substantial Pennsylvania manufacturer.  Interestingly, Piedmont signed up Brockway Air to be a Piedmont Commuter in January 1986, shortly before the Empire acquisition closed.\n\n\n=== Acquisition ===\n\nEmpire made significant changes in the summer of 1985. In July it announced it was moving its headquarters from Utica to Syracuse, driven in significant part by the convenience of collocating with its hub. Empire had 77 departures per day at Syracuse at the time. In August, in conjunction with a decision to purchase two more new F-28s to be delivered by year-end (taking the fleet to 15), Empire announced it was retiring its five Metro turboprops, becoming all jet.\nHowever, in late September, Empire announced it had received an offer for the airline from an unnamed party, and on October 2, Piedmont announced it had an agreement to buy Empire. The acquisition allowed Piedmont to accelerate its expansion into New York State, which started in 1985 with service from Baltimore to Buffalo and Rochester. Other attractions to Piedmont included Empire‚Äôs presence at key airports such as LaGuardia and Boston Logan. Empire‚Äôs fleet fit seamlessly into that of Piedmont, which already operated F-28s. Further, Piedmont offered $15/share for Empire shares that had been trading at a bid-offer range of $9 to 9+1‚ÅÑ8 the day before Empire announced it received an offer, so shareholders were well rewarded. Piedmont closed on the purchase on February 1, 1986. After operating as a separate subsidiary for three months, Empire merged into Piedmont on May 1, 1986.. The 1985 Piedmont annual report noted that the $42mm transaction cost was less than the price of two 737-300s.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nUnfortunately, most of Empire‚Äôs legacy was destroyed by 1991 due to USAir‚Äôs ill-advised mergers with Piedmont and Pacific Southwest Airlines.\nPiedmont‚Äôs acquisition of Empire accelerated its expansion into USAir territory and likely contributed to the urgency of USAir‚Äôs March 1987 bid for Piedmont. This brought together two of the most successful post-deregulation airlines, along with Pacific Southwest Airlines, which USAir had also purchased. But these were cash purchases, saddling USAir with $2 billion in debt, at an airline that heretofore had avoided leveraging itself. The mergers were difficult and the timing inopportune, as in 1990 the world suffered an oil price shock, the US entered a recession and there was a collapse in international air travel driven by the Iraq‚Äôs invasion of Kuwait. USAir generated six years of losses from 1989 through 1994 totaling over $3bn.. USAir killed the former Empire hub in Syracuse in 1991 and by the end of 1995 (when USAir finally again showed a profit), USAir‚Äôs F-28 fleet, inherited from Piedmont, numbered only 15, down from 45.\n\n\n== Network ==\nEmpire‚Äôs final network included 20 cities, 11 in New York State, plus Baltimore, Boston, Burlington (VT), Cleveland, Hartford, Newark and Washington DC, as well as Ottawa and Montreal in Canada. Generally every city was connected to Syracuse but many routes overflew that hub, such as Buffalo or Rochester to New York and Boston.\n\nNew York\nUtica (Oneida County Airport)* - base\nAlbany (Albany International Airport)\nBinghamton (Broome County Airport)\nBuffalo (Buffalo Niagara International Airport)\nElmira (Elmira Corning Regional Airport)\nIslip (Long Island MacArthur Airport)\nIthaca (Tompkins County Airport)\nNew York City (John F.

The number of F-28s steadily increased from two at the end of 1980 to 15 at the end of 1985. All were all new from the manufacturer except for four acquired used from defunct Altair Airlines at the end of 1983, which were put into the fleet in first half of 1984.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of defunct airlines of the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCoulthart, Jim (October 26, 2023). \"The Story of Empire Airlines with Jim Coulthart\" (video). youtube.com.

        "content": "Francisco de Borja Fanjul Fern√°ndez-Pita (born 19 December 1975) is a Spanish People's Party (PP) politician. He served in the Assembly of Madrid from 2011 to 2015 and Madrid City Council from 2015 to 2016 and again since 2019.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFanjul's grandfather Juan Manuel Fanjul and great-grandfather Joaqu√≠n Fanjul took part in a failed attempt to spread the Spanish coup of July 1936 to Madrid. Joaqu√≠n Fanjul was executed by the Second Spanish Republic, while Juan Manuel Fanjul survived and served in the Cortes Espa√±olas of Francoist Spain.\nFanjul has used a wheelchair since the age of 20, when he drove past a red traffic light after a night of drinking and was struck by another car. He graduated with a law degree from the Complutense University of Madrid, followed by a master's degree in portfolio management from the Instituto Estudios Burs√°tiles and another one on the legal aspects of disability from the University of Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha.\nFrom 2008 to 2011, Fanjul worked as an assistant to Francisco Va√±√≥, a paraplegic member of the Congress of Deputies. In December 2011, Fanjul entered the Assembly of Madrid after Mar√≠a Luz Bajo Prieto was elected to Congress. He was 18th on the PP list for the 2015 Madrid City Council election, and was elected. He left Madrid City Council in November 2016 when he was made director general of Policies of Support for Disability.\nIn the 2019 Madrid City Council election, Jos√© Luis Mart√≠nez-Almeida placed Fanjul sixth on the PP list. After being installed as mayor of Madrid, Almeida named Fanjul his second deputy mayor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Elias Huizar was a former police officer who committed suicide after murdering his ex-wife and girlfriend in West Richland, Washington. He had previously been fired due to charges of rape, and after murdering the two victims, became a fugitive from the law.\nOn April 23, Huizar fired at officers during a pursuit in Eugene, Oregon in which he shot at officers before killing himself. The 1-year-old son Roman Santos of his late girlfriend Angelica, is safe.\n\n\n== Early life and first arrests ==\nHuizar attended the Dickinson State University in North Dakota and participated in college sports there. He was arrested twice in 2008, once for brandishing a knife and threatening students, and then again two months later for criminal trespass. He was never tried for either alleged offense, but he was barred from competing in college sports.\n\n\n== Yakima ==\nHuizar moved to Yakima and was hired as a police officer in July of 2013, his arrest history not sufficient to prevent him from becoming an officer of the law.\nHe coached wrestling in his spare time; one of the underage girls that he coached, Amber Rodriguez, would later become his first wife. \n\n\n=== Alleged sexual assault of a child ===\nHuizar was assigned to be a school resource officer at Washington Middle School. While there, in 2019, he allegedly engaged in illicit sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl.\nHuizar resigned, though an official investigation failed to uncover any clear evidence of the claims against him. The girl who claimed she was in a relationship with him was ultimately expelled.\nHuizar was transferred, against his will, to another middle school in the district. Later that year, he and Rodriguez  divorced.\n\n\n== \"Spiraling out of control\" ==\nHuizar was placed on leave sometime prior to April 2021, and he moved to West Richland, about 45 minutes to the southeast. The police chief in Yakima described Huizar as \"spiraling out of control\". \nHe had at least one altercation at William Wiley Elementary School, where Rodriguez worked as a paraeducator, that resulted in police being called to the scene, and which was later characterized as being a \"domestic violence incident\".\nBy April 2021, a memo was circulated among the WRPD warning them about Huizar.\nHuizar was placed again on leave in July 2021. An investigation into him by the Union Gap Police Department (who was referred the case by the Yakima Police Department) was \"unable to discover sufficient evidence to pursue a criminal complaint\", with the only solid evidence of wrongdoing being \"failing to report the domestic violence incident at Wiley Elementary\".\nNevertheless, Huizar was either fired or resigned in February 2022, and deemed ineligible for rehire.\n\n\n== Hired by Richland School District ==\nAs he was leaving Yakima Police Department, he applied for a position as a substitute teacher with the Richland School District (Washington), which overviews education in the city of West Richland, as well. \nAs none of the arrests or allegations against him ever resulted in criminal convictions, his background check returned clean, and he was hired and began work the same month he left the Yakima Police Department.\n\n\n== Teenage \"girlfriend\" ==\nBy 2023, Huizar was living with his now 17-year-old rape victim, who was the very same girl who had been expelled from her school in Yakima at the age of 13 after claiming she had been sexually abused by Huizar.\nWhen she was 15, she became pregnant with Huizar's child, and gave birth to Roman Huizar in 2022.\n\n\n== Rape allegations ==\nOn February 3, 2024, Huizar's 17-year-old girlfriend invited a 16-year-old friend over to their house. After providing them with alcohol, Huizar attempted to rape the 16-year-old; when Huizar's girlfriend woke up and discovered this, she and the 16-year-old victim attempted to escape. Despite Huizar's attempt to block them in, they were successful at getting away.\nThe police were called, a SWAT team was sent, and Huizar refused to cooperate. The SWAT team did successfully infiltrate, and Huizar was arrested and over $15,000 dollars in cash was seized.\nBail was set at just $200,000, and Huizar was promptly released that same evening. He pled \"not guilty\" later that month.\nFour days later, the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission placed Huizar's certification as a law officer as Under Review.\nBoth Rodriguez and a female minor filed for and received a restraining order against Huizar that same month.\nOn April 19, Rodriguez filed to modify a shared custody agreement she had with Huizar.\n\n\n== Court date and double murder ==\nOn April 22, Huizar did not show at his court date for the rape case. Instead, that afternoon, he visited the elementary school that Rodriguez worked at. Sometime between 3:00 PM and 3:20 PM, he is alleged to have murdered Rodriguez with a gun in front of the school during student dismissal, shooting two to five times.\nAccording to law enforcement, he then fled to his residence, murdered his girlfriend, and then left with his son, Roman.\nHe was caught by law enforcement outside of Eugene, Oregon the next day. He sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 23 and died; the child was unharmed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Saltine Warrior was the former mascot of Syracuse University in the United States. It was in use for the college from 1931 to 1978. Based on a legend about Ogeekeda Hoschenegada, a 16th-century leader of the Onondaga Nation, the mascot acquired popularity after appearing in school publications and eventually became part of the university's culture. At first, the mascot was celebrated across campus, symbolizing pride and spirit. The Saltine Warrior became a rallying symbol which was prominently seen at sporting events and other high publicized gatherings. However, everything changed in the middle of the 1950s, when the mascot would start to receive high levels of controversy. Students and indigenous communities would retaliate against a caricature costume, to which was worn by members of Syracuse's Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. The mascot was retired in 1978 as a result of efforts to have it removed, and this marked the beginning of programs designed to increase indigenous inclusion and knowledge on campus.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe development of the Saltine Warrior as Syracuse University's mascot became intertwined with the legend of Ogeekeda Hoschenegada, a notable 16th-century chief of the Onondaga Nation. The supposed finding of Ogeekeda Hoschenegada's remains was the central story point. Excavation partner Dr. Burges Johnson made waves when he announced the discovery of what was allegedly an image or likeness of the chief. Named \"O-gee-ke-da Ho-schen-e-ga-da,\" which translates to \"The Salt (or Salty) Warrior\" in English, this representation was made. Throughout the university community and beyond, this revelation sparked curiosity and fascination.\nThe excavation of the former Syracuse University Women's Building in the late 1920s marked the beginning of this blending of academic culture and historical myth. The academic community was intrigued and fascinated by the widespread belief that Ogeekeda Hoschenegada's remains had been discovered during this dig. Not only was the supposed finding of Hoschenegada's remains intriguing historically, but it soon became a central story at Syracuse University. Even though subsequent information proved the story was untrue, it had a significant and long-lasting effect on the university's culture.\nIt was published in The Orange Peel in 1931, which provided a forum for the myth's propagation, bringing it to the forefront and igniting interest among college students. The legend's story within the university's cultural environment was furthered by the publication of the legend in The Orange Peel, which sparked extensive attention and discussion. The Daily Orange and other regional news outlets later played a part in spreading the myth and ensuring its perpetuation in Syracuse University students' collective memory. The mascot was retired in response to complaints from a Native American student organization regarding its derogatory representation, even though its existence continued until the late 1970s. The university then looked into a number of mascot alternatives before deciding on Otto the Orange in 1980.\nA bronze sculpture portraying the Saltine Warrior sits outside of Carnegie Library, a building on the university's North Campus. Graduate student Luise Meyers Kaish created sculpture in 1951, and presented it as a gift from the class of 1951. Luise was born on Sep 8, 1925 in Atlanta, Georgia and died on March 7, 2013. She was a Rome Prize Fellow, Guggenheim Fellow, & was awarded Arents Pioneer Medal from SU. Her work is portrayed in \"Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Jewish Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

This portrayal includes exaggerated and insulting parts intended to be amusing, but ultimately reinforced negative stereotypes about Native American customs. The Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs met in 1970 and concluded the following: ‚ÄúThe depiction of an Indian running around in leather and a Sioux war bonnet was not only incorrect, but offensive. The chiefs explained that there was no dignity within the native community when the Saltine Warrior meets and jousts with wildcats, hogs, bulldogs in front of thousands of people.‚Äù\n\n\n== Retirement and Impact ==",

        "content": "Cigars, Acappella, Candy is an album by the American singing group the Belmonts, release in 1972. To coincide with a doo-wop television special, Spike Lee & Company: Do It a Cappella, the album was rereleased by Elektra Records in 1990, at the same time as the Persuasions' Chirpin'.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Bob Feldman. \"Street Corner Symphony\" is a medley of 14 early pop, doo-wop, and rock and roll songs. The version of George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\", which includes a snippet of the Chiffons' \"He's So Fine\", employed kazoo and percussion.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe New York Times labeled Cigars, Acappella, Candy \"more interesting\" than the Dion and the Belmonts reunion album, and deemed \"Street Corner Symphony\" \"a miracle of compression.\" Robert Christgau praised the album but expressed his preference for the Persuasions. Richard Price, in a Rolling Stone interview with Dion, similarly considered the album second only to the work of the Persuasions. The Chicago Tribune wrote that the Belmonts \"handle the a cappella format well, producing a hefty sound with swooping falsetto, vibrant bass, and tight harmonies.\" The Commercial Appeal noted the \"superb three-part harmonizing.\" The Buffalo Evening News determined that the Belmonts sing the songs \"with style, a little flash and not too much pandering.\"\nIn December 1979, the music critics Ed Ward and Greil Marcus included the album on their Village Voice ballots for the 10 best albums of the 1970s. In 1992, The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll called Cigars, Acappella, Candy \"some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful doo-wop singing ever recorded.\" In 2010, Spin listed the album as one of eight \"essential\" doo-wop albums, writing that the Belmonts \"sing music that still feels transmitted from space.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

His father's name is Jean Tohou√©gno and her mother's name is Douhoun Houngnonsi. A few years after her birth, her parents divorced, and she was taken care of by her grandmother. She completed primary and secondary education. Afterward, she took training as a healthcare assistant and earned her diploma in 2007.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon receiving the diploma, Chantal worked as a nurse at a private clinic managed by an NGO named Barka. In 2008, she met Michel Djotodia and was impressed by his status as a political refugee, flattering skill, and multilingualism. Soon, she fell in love with Djotodia. \nNevertheless, Djotodia was arrested and imprisoned in Cotonou Prison since he was a Central African government fugitive. Hearing that Djotodia was in prison, Chantal contacted NGOs, human rights organizations, and the press to prevent him from being extracted to the Central African Republic. Due to her effort, Djotodia was freed in 2010 after 18 months of imprisonment. \nAfter the release, the couple struggled to pay rent. Consequently, they were often evicted from rental houses due to their inability to pay the rent. In 2011, Djotodia temporarily left Chantal to join the rebellion, causing her to be expelled from the apartment she rented due to her inability to pay it. Later, Djotodia returned to Cotonou, and Chantal married Michel Djotodia in Cotonou on 27 June 2012.  \n\n\n== First Lady ==\nSoon after Djotodia managed to topple Bozize, Chantal went to Bangui and became the first lady.  \nAs a first lady, she founded a foundation aiming to assist orphans, mothers, HIV/AIDS patients, and elderly people \"The Renaissance.\" Apart from that, Chantal donated a generator for the maternity ward, which often faced power cuts. Chantal was also one of the four African ladies who signed the Declaration of Niamey, purposing to fight fake medicine and fight against the high mortality rate problem.\n\n\n== Post-First Lady ==\nAnticipating the fall of Seleka regime, Chantal returned to Benin three weeks before his husband's arrival on 11 January 2014 and bought a house for the couple to live in.\nIn 2018, Chantal reportedly got ill and went to Dubai for medical treatment.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William \"Micky\" Bennett was an association footballer who played in the 1890 FA Cup final for Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nHe played as centre-forward for Rotherham Town, Mexborough, and Doncaster Rovers,  He was particularly noted for his heading ability, and was said to \"know no fear\".  He won the Sheffield Senior Cup with Mexborough in 1885‚Äì86, heading the equalizer in a 2‚Äì1 win over Heeley in the final, at the Old Forge Ground.\nIn the summer of 1889, he signed Sheffield Wednesday, amid controversy, as he had apparently signed contracts for both Wednesday and Rotherham Town; he was suspended by the Football Association while the issue was sorted out - Bennett's defence was that he was unable to write so could not have signed for Town.  The Association eventually ruled that Bennett could start playing for Wednesday after 1 November 1889.  Nevertheless, Town sued Bennett for ¬£5 in damages, Bennett's mother being thrown out of court for interrupting Town's testimony; Town was eventually awarded ¬£5 10/9, to cover the travel costs for a substitute for a match in which Bennett had been selected.\nBennett was not a regular for Wednesday, and had to be brought into the XI for the FA Cup final at the end of his first season, in order to replace an injured Winterbottom;  Wednesday duly went down 6‚Äì1 to Blackburn Rovers.  Bennett did head home a cross in the first half but the goal was ruled out on the basis that the ball had already crossed the goal-line; he did eventually score from another header in the 53rd minute, but by this time Wednesday was already 4‚Äì0 down.\nHis career at Wednesday did not last long, and he finished his career with a couple of seasons back at Mexborough.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBennett's younger brothers Walter and 'Tip' were also professional footballers, the former for Sheffield United amongst others and the latter for Barnsley.  He married Annie in 1879 and the couple had two sons and a daughter.\nBennett volunteered for duty in the First World War in 1915, despite being 53 years old, joining the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry until rheumatism invalided him out a few months later.  He died at his home in Mexborough on 13 September 1919.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2015, following Oculus VR's acquisition by Facebook, Oculus Share was shut down and revamped as the Oculus Store for the consumer-facing Oculus Rift, including pre-approvals, sales taxes and comfort ratings. In addition, the company announced an investment of $10 million into indie game developers to distribute their games in the store.\nIn 2021, Facebook introduced \"App Lab\", a new section within the storefront allowing developers to upload and distribute apps without going through the formal review process. App Lab is designed primarily to support early access models, and can support public and invite-based distribution.\nAs a result of Facebook's corporate rebranding as Meta Platforms, CTO Andrew Bosworth announced that the Oculus brand would be phased out in 2022; all Facebook hardware products will be marketed under the Meta name, and Oculus Store would be renamed Quest Store. Likewise, immersive social platforms associated with Oculus will be brought under the Horizon brand (such as Horizon Worlds).\nOn April 22, 2024, the company announced that the Meta Quest Store was renamed as the Meta Horizon Store. In the same announcement, software platform would be rebranded as Meta Horizon OS and opened to third-party headset manufacturers (starting with Microsoft, Asus and Lenovo), the Meta Quest mobile companion app renamed as the Horizon mobile app, and a new spatial app framework was announced to assist mobile developers in porting their software to, or programming original apps for, Horizon OS. In addition, the company announced that App Lab would be phased out in two phases, first placing App Lab access inside of a tab in the Horizon Store instead of a separate URL, and later phasing out all references to App Lab and merging App Lab content into the Horizon Store while no longer rejecting submissions to the Store on the basis of taste or quality.   \n\n\n=== Controversies ===\nIn 2022, the Federal Trade Commission and the attorneys general of New York, Tennessee, and North Carolina began investigations into Meta's VR-related business practices, including third-party app distribution on the Oculus Store, over allegations of anti-competitive behaviors.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reyna Tropical is a US band founded by Fabi Reyna and Nectali \"Sumohair\" D√≠az in 2016. \nTheir music is influenced by Colombian, Peruvian, and Mexican musical styles, as well as Congolese rhythms. Reyna Tropical have released two EPs and one studio album.\nSince D√≠az's death in 2022, Reyna has been the sole member of the band.\n\n\n== History ==\nFabi Reyna and Nectali D√≠az were both born in Mexico and raised in the US.\nReyna is the founder of She Shreds Media and has played guitar professionally with bands including Priests, Raveena, and Sleater-Kinney. D√≠az was a DJ and producer, and was active in the nightclub scene in Los Angeles. The pair met at a Red Bull Music Academy event in 2016, where they bonded over a shared appreciation for Bomba Est√©reo.:‚Ää18:22‚Äì18:45‚Ää\nIn early recording sessions D√≠az encouraged Reyna to sing, which she wasn't previously comfortable doing.:‚Ää18:50‚Äì19:15‚Ää\n\n\n=== 2018-2022: Career as a duo ===\nReyna Tropical self-released their first EP Reyna Tropical in January 2018. It was called \"refreshingly succinct and buoyant\" by NPR. The tracks were initially recorded in a series of 4-hour improvised sessions. \nIn December 2018 Reyna Tropical supported Bomba Est√©reo on their US Jungla Tour, after being invited to do so by lead singer Li Saumet.\nIn March 2019 Reyna Tropical perfomed at the opening party of SXSW Music Festival, and in April they played at Est√©reo Beach Festival in Santa Marta, Colombia. Reyna and D√≠az's expriences with nature in Colombia inspired their second EP Sol y Lluvia, which they released in August 2019. Similarly to the first EP, the tracks were initially recorded in improvised sessions.\nNectali D√≠az died unexpectedly in July 2022. In a 2023 interview, Reyna said that \"for several months I didn‚Äôt know how to perform on stage without him, or how to write music without him...it left me with the question of, \"How is this going to continue? Is this fair, is this what he wants?\" But the answer was always a resounding yes.\" The first song that Reyna wrote after D√≠az's death was \"Ya Va Pasar\", using a beat created by D√≠az, and the song was released as a single on independent record label Psychic Hotline in November 2023.\n\n\n=== 2022-present: Malegr√≠a ===\nIn March 2024 Reyna Tropical's debut album Malegr√≠a was released on Psychic Hotline. The album includes material that Reyna and D√≠az had been working on together as far back as July 2020. The title of the album is a portmanteau of the Spanish words mal (bad) and alegr√≠a (happiness), and was taken from the title of a Manu Chao song. Isabelia Herrera of Pitchfork described Malegr√≠a as \"an incisive exploration of the porosity of diasporic life\", and rated it 7.7/10. Herrera also wrote that the album contains influences of chicha, zapateado, and soukous rhythms. PopMatters rated the album 8/10, and called it a \"wild creation.\" Anne Lorenz of Westdeutscher Rundfunk described the album as \"a stormy celebration of queer Afro culture.\":‚Ääq‚Ää\nReyna Tropical is touring with Portugal. The Man to support the album, and will perform at Newport Folk Festival in July 2024.\n\n\n== Musical style and themes ==\nReyna Tropical's music takes influence from traditional Latin American and African rhythms and musical styles. In an article for BrooklynVegan, Bill Pearis described Malegr√≠a as incorporating \"musical styles from all over the Southern hemisphere, including Congolese, Peruvian, Colombian grooves,\" and Fabi Reyna named tracks by Manu Chao, Priya Ragu, Caf√© Tacvba, and Dennis Brown as influences on the album. In 2024 Reyna told Alternative Press that \"recently, my influences have formed to become folks that play in West Africa, in the Congo, soukous, champeta, chicha, Peruvian cumbia, and those folks are mimicking bird sounds and a lot of nature sounds.\" Richard Villegas of Remezcla wrote that \"influences from champeta, buyerengue  [sic] and ancestral chanting can be heard across Reyna Tropical‚Äôs small but vibrant catalogue.\" According to Emilly Prado of NPR, Reyna Tropical \"highlight and reimagine the multicultural influences of their childhoods through Afro-Mexican melodies, cumbias spanning from Mexico to Peru, and expert digital mixing.\"\n\n\n=== Improvisation ===\nBoth of Reyna Tropical's EPs began as improvised sessions between Reyna and D√≠az.\nReyna has said that \"my creative process often involves being in Colombia, learning from local people, recording on the beach with my interface and guitar, improvising lyrics on the spot.\":‚Ääq‚Ää\n\n\n=== Culture and identity ===\nFabi Reyna sees her mixed cultural heritage as fundamental to her music.\nIn 2019 she said that \"when I met Sumo, we blended our worlds of music and activism, where I focus on queer identity and being a Mexican woman living in America.\"\nD√≠az was Afro-Mexican, and the band had a motto of \"Queer Love and Afro-Mexico\", which Rolling Stone described as being \"at the heart of their music\".\nReyna has described Reyna Tropical as \"a project that explores diasporic experiences,\":‚Ääq‚Ää and said that the album Malegr√≠a focuses on the process of \"learning to trust myself and discovering the power of being a mestiza woman.\":‚Ääq‚Ää In another interview she said that \"I am a mixture of many worlds, so my art...brings together all the worlds, all the diasporic experiences of my own life.\":‚Ääq‚Ää\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMalegr√≠a (2024, Psychic Hotline)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nReyna Tropical (2018, self-released)\nSol y Lluvia (2019, self-released)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Oro\" (2018, self-released)\n\"Como Fuego\" (2019, self-released)\n\"Dolor\" (2020, self-released)\n\"Ya Va Pasar\" (2023, Psychic Hotline)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReyna Tropical on Bandcamp",

        "content": "Dragana Miljaniƒá (born 1978) (Serbian Cyrillic: –î—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω–∞ –º–∏—ô–∞–Ω–∏—õ; born 1978) is a Serbian politician. She served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2022 to 2024 as a member of the far-right Serbian Party Oathkeepers (SSZ).\n\n\n== Private career ==\nMiljaniƒá is an economist based in the Belgrade municipality of Zvezdara.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nMiljaniƒá received the eighth position on the SSZ's electoral list in the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election. The list did not cross the electoral threshold for assembly representation.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nMiljaniƒá was given the tenth position on the SSZ's list in the 2022 parliamentary election and was elected when the list won exactly ten seats. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won the election, and the SSZ served in opposition. During her parliamentary term, Miljaniƒá was a member of the culture and information committee and the committee on education, science, technological development, and the information society, a deputy member of the defence and internal affairs committee and the committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues, a deputy member of the European Union‚ÄìSerbia stabilization and association committee, a deputy member of Serbia's delegation to the South-East European Cooperation Process parliamentary assembly, and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with the Czech Republic, the Holy See, Hungary, and Portugal.\nIn a May 2023 assembly debate, Miljaniƒá accused the Progressives of abandoning the predominantly Serb communities in the north of Kosovo to the Pri≈°tina authorities. She called for Serbia to end negotiations with Albin Kurti's government, declare Kosovo to be occupied territory, and return the question of its status to the United Nations.\nThe Oathkeepers contested the 2023 parliamentary election in an alliance with Dveri, and Miljaniƒá received the fifth position on their combined list, which did not cross the threshold for assembly representation. Her term ended when the new assembly convened in February 2024.\nDveri leader Bo≈°ko Obradoviƒá later said that his party's alliance with the Oathkeepers had been a mistake. Miljaniƒá responded by accusing Obradoviƒá of trying to restore his ties to the \"pro-Brussels opposition,\" referring to Dveri's previous association with pro-western parties in the Alliance for Serbia.\n\n\n=== City politics in Belgrade ===\nMiljaniƒá appeared in the thirty-fifth position on the SSZ's list in the 2022 Belgrade City Assembly election and was not elected when the list won four seats. She later received the seventh position on a combined SSZ‚ÄìDveri list in the 2023 city election. The list did not cross the electoral threshold.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caritas Poland (Polish: Caritas Polska) is a Polish Catholic not-for-profit social welfare and humanitarian relief organisation. It is a service of the Polish Bishops' Conference and the largest social welfare and charitable organisation in the country.\nCaritas Poland is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis. \n\n\n== History ==\nAlready towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, there were different attempts to centralise and coordinate the Church's charitable activities in Poland. After the Second Polish Republic was established in 1918, this process accelerated. In 1922, an association of Polish Catholic charitable societies was created in Pozna≈Ñ and adopted the name \"Caritas\". It was modelled after the German Caritas, which had been founded 25 years prior. Soon, Caritas associations were established in almost all dioceses. Work included care for children and young people, among other by creating orphanages and other institutions.\nHowever, the further development of Caritas structures was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Immediately after the liberation in 1945, Archbishop Sapieha established a national Caritas headquarters, in accordance with the resolution of the Polish Episcopal Conference. In the context of large-scale destruction and huge shortages and needs, the Catholic Church joined in providing all kinds of help to the population. Branches of the renewed Caritas were established in parishes.\nThe communist authorities and the increased sovietization of the country stood in the way of the dynamically developing union. They saw the philanthropic activity of the Church as actions undermining their authority. The first restrictions on church organisations also appeared in order to reduce their influence on young people. On 12 January 1950, at a meeting of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, a plan was adopted to completely liquidate the Caritas organisation in Poland, under the pretext of embezzlement of funds. The liquidation took place on 23 January 1950 and the State took over its subordinate institutions.\nHowever, the end of the Church structures as Caritas did not mean the cessation of the Church's charitable activities which continued at a lower scale. This activity was coordinated by the Polish Episcopal Commission for the Pastoral Care of Mercy, which was renamed in 1981 as the Polish Episcopal Charitable Commission. Departments of charitable pastoral care were established in individual dioceses, and charity teams were established in parishes.\nIn 1989, the State and the Church signed an agreement which made it possible to reactivate Caritas Poland and the diocesan Caritas. Caritas Poland was reactivated with a decree of the Polish Episcopal Conference of 10 October 1990 as an institution drawing inspiration from the charitable and social activities conducted in Poland before the Communist regime.\nAfter the fall of communism in Poland, Caritas Poland developed massively. In the 21st century, Caritas Poland and its diocesan structures operate over 1,000 centres specialised in social assistance and in the field of medical and educational care.\nIn 2021, the National Bank of Poland issued a special collector's coin in honour of the 30th anniversary of the reactivation of Caritas Poland.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCaritas Poland operates through a national office and 44 diocesan and archdiocesan Caritas structures across the country. The national office serves as the central coordinating body and also takes on formative and informative responsibilities. This includes conducting training courses, symposia, and conducting assessments to identify the extent of poverty in Poland.\nIn addition to its coordination and educational functions, the national office plays an operational role by leading nationwide fundraising initiatives both domestically and internationally. Caritas Poland organises humanitarian transports and provides emergency and long-term assistance, offering material, psychological, legal, and financial aid to various vulnerable groups such as the unemployed, homeless persons, the sick, the elderly, children from struggling families, immigrants, and refugees.\nThe diocesan structures of Caritas Poland are:\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 2022, Caritas Poland supported around 412,000 people with food aid, including 340,000 who received regular assistance. The organisation distributed more than 14,000 tons of food for a value of around 131.5 million z≈Çoty. In addition, around 47,500 children received material, educational or psychological.\nIn addition, Caritas Poland provided support abroad in 33 countries on four continents at a level of more than 63 million z≈Çoty.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Website (in Polish)\n\n\n== References ==",

It coexisted with the nearby Idrisid Emirate of Asir. The Emirate's territories included Taif, as well as domains in Yemen. Their small wars against the Ottoman Empire led to them being temporarily overtaken by the Ottomans, until they withdrew after losing the First World War. The Emirate finally ended in 1919, and 'Asir itself was then annexed by Ibn Saud into the country of Saudi Arabia.\nThe Emirate was led by rulers from the Aidh family, an Arab ruling family of Arabian Jewish descent. In 1916, the Sheikdom of Upper 'Asir was formed by members of the Aidh family, which had broken away from the Idrisid Emirate of 'Asir.\n\n\n== List of Emirs ==\nAidh bin Mar'i al-Yazidi (r. 1833‚Äì1857)\nMuhammad bin Aidh (r. 1857‚Äì1873)\nNasser bin Aidh (r. 1873‚Äì1875)\nAbdul Rahman bin Aidh (Territory taken over temporarily by the Ottoman Empire)\nAli bin Muhammad bin Aidh (Territory taken over temporarily by the Ottoman Empire)\nAbdullah bin Muhammad bin Aidh (Last Emir under Ottoman rule before they left in 1908)\nHasan bin Ali al-Aidh (1908‚Äì1910/1919), leader of the Sheikdom of Upper 'Asir\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmirate of Diriyah\nEmirate of Nejd\nEmirate of Jabal Shammar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Songwriter is the 72nd studio album (and fifth posthumously released studio album) by Johnny Cash. It is scheduled to be released on June 28, 2024, through Mercury Nashville.\nProduced by John Carter Cash and David R. Ferguson, the album contains eleven original songs by Cash: the album's lead single, \"Well Alright\", was released on April 23, 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album was recorded as a series of songwriting demos at LSI Studios (then owned by Rosey Cash) in early 1993, a time when Cash wasn't signed to a label and shortly before he met Rick Rubin. The songs were written over several decades: \"Drive On\" was recent, \"Hello Out There\" and \"Poor Valley Girl\" have been dated to the late '70s and \"Sing It Pretty, Sue\" had appeared as the last track of the 1962 album The Sound of Johnny Cash. The tapes were shelved when Cash instead made the American Recordings album with Rubin, although he used re-recordings of the songs \"Drive On\" and \"Like A Soldier\" for that album.\nAfter rediscovering the demos, John Carter Cash and David \"Fergie\" Ferguson stripped them back to just Cash's vocals and guitar before overdubbing newly recorded parts by a new band, including several musicians who had worked with Cash such as Marty Stuart and David Roe.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Podgora was a battle between Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces during World War I.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPodgora, also known as Monte Calvario in Italian and Kalvarija in Slovenian, was one of the main bulwarks of the Austro-Hungarian defense of the strategically important city of Gorizia during the early battles of the Isonzo. It was heavily fortified with multiple lines of trenches, barbed wire and machine-gun posts. Further protection was provided by the Austro-Hungarian artillery positioned on the peaks.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nOn 19 June 1915 at 10:20am the attack began with the 75 mm battery hitting the Austro-Hungarian trenches on the left where the machine guns were located. At 11:00am, the 8th Company, under the command of Captain Vallaro, jumped from the trench, followed 30 meters by Lieutenant Losco's 7th and, another 30 metres, by Captain Lazari's 9th. The Carabinieri immediately came under intense Austro-Hungarian fire which slowed down until it halted the advance of the 7th Company, which was soon left without its commander, who was mortally wounded (Lieutenant Losco would be remembered as the first Carabinieri officer to die in battle during the first world War). Some elements of the 8th Company managed to overtake their comrades from the 7th, settling close to the enemy fences. The 9th Company managed to advance to where the 7th and 8th had already been stopped despite suffering heavy casualties which including their commanding officer Captain Lazari who was seriously wounded. Once the survivors had reorganised, a new bayonet attack was launched which brought the Carabinieri a few meters from the enemy fences, in a fold of ground. But the action was costly and the position proved to be very precarious, so much so that after a few minutes, among others, lieutenant colonel Pranzetti and lieutenants Parziale and Struffi were wounded. The heavy losses prevented the 3rd Battalion from continuing the action so at 13:00 the 4th and 5th companies of the 2nd Battalion went into action. The intense enemy fire, however, allowed only a few elements to reunite with the survivors of the 3rd Battalion: among the first wounded were lieutenants De Dominicis and Ciuffoletti. The 2nd battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment also intervened in support, but was unable to advance. Meanwhile, on the left, the Austro-Hungarians had repelled an attack by the 1st Infantry Regiment, and managed to gain a favorable position to strike the Carabinieri from behind.\nGiven the deteriorating situation, the Carabinieri were ordered to settle as best they could on the positions they had captured at such a high cost and prepare to defend against a possible Austro-Hungarian counterattack. It was also planned to renew the attack with the support of the 2nd battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment. However, a few minutes before the appointed time the order was revoked by the command of the VI Army Corps because, in consideration of the losses already suffered, it was deemed necessary to prepare for the new attack with more effective artillery fire.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt a height of 240m at 18:00, the wounded were cleared away. Taking advantage of the darkness of the night, some volunteer Carabinieri took care of the recovery and burial of the fallen. The day ended with 53 dead, 143 wounded and 11 missing. Podgora would later be captured by the infantry of the Casale brigade (11th and 12th Infantry Regiment) during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, which would lead to the conquest of Gorizia on 6 August 1916.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Espero (\"Hesperus\") was an Italian Nembo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1905, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign. In the aftermath of the Impresa di Fiume of 1919, she played a role in the defense of the Free State of Fiume against Italy in 1920. Renamed Turbine and reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1923.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\nEspero was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, and launched on 9 July 1904 and completed on 1 April 1905. She was commissioned in April 1905.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Espero‚Ä≤s took place in 1912. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. Sometime between 1914 and 1918, Espero underwent additional modifications in which minelaying equipment was installed aboard her.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Espero, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Bellavita, as well as her sister ships Aquilone, Borea, Nembo, and Turbine made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto. During the night of  23‚Äì24 May 1915 ‚Äî the first night of Italy's participation in the war ‚Äî Espero towed the submarine Velella across the Adriatic Sea to the coast of Austria-Hungary so that Velella could lay in ambush off the major Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Cattaro.\nAt 19:00 on 8 June 1916 Espero departed Vlor√´ (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania with the protected cruiser Libia and the destroyers Impavido, Insidioso, and Pontiere to escort the armed merchant cruiser Principe Umberto and the troopship Romagna, which together had embarked the 2,605 men of the Italian Royal Army‚Ä≤s (Regio Esercito‚Ä≤s) 55th Infantry Regiment for transportation to Italy. The convoy had traveled only a short distance when the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-5 hit Principe Umberto in the stern with two torpedoes. Principe Umberto sank in a few minutes about 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) southwest of Cape Linguetta with the loss of 1,926 of the 2,821 men on board, the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of lives lost. The escorting warships rescued the survivors but could not locate and counterattack U-5.\nEspero continued her World War I service without taking part in any other significant actions. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Fiume ===\n\nBefore Italy entered World War I, it had made a pact with the Allies, the Treaty of London of 1915, in which it was promised all of the Austrian Littoral, but not the city of Fiume (known in Croatian as Rijeka). After the war, at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, this delineation of territory was confirmed, with Fiume remaining outside of Italy's borders and amalgamated into the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which in 1929 would be renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Opposing this outcome, the poet and Italian nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio led a force of about 2,600 so-called \"legionaries\" to Fiume and seized the city in September 1919 in what became known as the Impresa di Fiume (\"Fiume endeavor\" or \"Fiume enterprise\"). The Italian government opposed D'Annunzio's move, and in response D'Annunzio declared Fiume to be the Italian Regency of Carnaro in September 1920. Relations between Italy and D'Annunzio's government continued to deteriorate, and after Italy signed the Treaty of Rapallo with the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in November 1920, making Fiume an independent state as the Free State of Fiume rather than incorporating it into Italy, D'Annunzio declared war on Italy.\nAt the time, Espero was serving in the Adriatic Sea on escort duty on the shipping route between ≈†ibenik (known to the Italians as Sebenico) and Trieste. She switched to D'Annunzio's side and arrived at Fiume on 8 December 1920 to support him. Italy launched a full-scale invasion of Fiume on 24 December 1920, beginning what became known as the Bloody Christmas. The Italian battleship Andrea Doria fired on Espero on 26 December, inflicting serious damage on her and setting her on fire, and one of the men killed during the Bloody Christmas was a member of her crew.\nThe Bloody Christmas fighting ended on 29 December 1920 in D'Annunzio's defeat and the establishment of the Free State of Fiume. In January 1921, Espero arrived at Pula for repairs and modifications. Like other Italian ships which had supported D'Annunzio, she was disarmed and briefly stricken from the naval register.\n\n\n=== Later service ===\n\nEspero was reinstated on 16 January 1921 with the name Turbine, the name previously held by her sister ship Turbine, which Austro-Hungarian ships had sunk on 24 May 1915. After completion of her repairs and modifications ‚Äî which included the removal of one 76-millimetre gun and  the installation of a Colt Browning 65-millimeter/80-caliber antiaircraft machine gun ‚Äî Turbine returned to operations in June 1921. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in July 1921, she again was stricken from the naval register in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Autobiography of Values is a book by the American aviator Charles Lindbergh, edited by William Jovanovich and published posthumously in 1977.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book was edited by Lindbergh's friend William Jovanovich from more than 2000 pages Lindbergh left when he died in 1974. The material includes Lindbergh's thoughts about the future of aviation, such as the Arctic route between North America and Asia and the improvement of rocket-powered aircraft. In political affairs, the book affirms Lindbergh's opposition to American participation in World War II and his view of Nazi Germany as less bad than the Soviet Union. The book also deals with Lindbergh's search for what he called a \"return to essential life-stream values\", which he associated with wilderness and with breaking the dichotomy between primitive life and civilization.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKirkus Reviews called the book \"Lindbergh's last communion with the cosmos\" and described it as more of a monologue than a memoir. The critic wrote that Lindbergh \"lacked vision in human affairs\", and the book contains very little about people, but in \"the air, he is observant unto eloquence\".\nEric F. Goldman of The New York Times called the editing a triumph, despite repetitions and a lack of proportionality between subjects. Goldberg wrote that some of Lindbergh's \"philosophizing\" is \"just plain awful\", characterized by views popular in the United States of the early 1900s when Lindbergh came of age, and by the influence of the biologist Alexis Carrel, whose writings about \"genetic memory\" affected Lindbergh in the 1930s. Despite his concerns, Goldberg wrote that the book is relevant as a collection of beautiful and powerful reflections from a major craftsman of \"technological civilization\".\nFrancis Russell wrote for the Modern Age that the book is characterized by a stoic attitude. He described it as \"a brave book, a document of our times by a man of penetrating if rough-formed intellect, written with a singular clarity of style and feeling\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Promoted to assume responsibilities in the Northern region of the Communist Party in 1926, he was sentenced to one year and then eight months in prison for \"provoking soldiers to disobedience\" following an article published in L'Avant-Garde, the newspaper of communist youth.\nSuspected of Trotskyism in 1930 because of his friendship with Albert Cornette, secretary of the CGTU, he lived a brief period of misfortune until 1932 when he resumed responsibilities in the North, then as a permanent member of the Central Committee, in Paris, where he was responsible for directing the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union (AUS), a position he held until 1939. In 1933 he spent a month in the USSR. In 1936, the association had 70,000 members and its magazine Russie d'aujourd'hui had a circulation of 130,000 copies.\nIn 1935, Fernand Grenier was responsible for the reconquest of the city of Saint-Denis, then in the Seine department, whose mayor, Jacques Doriot, had just been excluded from the Party. In the legislative elections of April‚ÄìMay 1936, Doriot was re-elected with a lead of 700 votes. After Doriot had resigned his mandate as deputy, Fernand Grenier stood in the partial legislative elections of August 1, 1937, and was elected deputy for Saint-Denis, defeating Doriot's replacement. In the Chamber of Deputies he was part of the Foreign Affairs Commission and the Final Accounts and Economy Commission.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nMobilized in September 1939 he was demobilized near Annecy. Along with other communist deputies, he was stripped of his parliamentary mandate on January 21, 1940, and subsequently, of his mandate as municipal councilor of Saint-Denis in February 1940.\nAfter having had difficulties in resuming contact with the clandestine apparatus of the party, he was chosen to represent the Central Committee during the first contacts with the envoys of Free France. He then met Colonel R√©my on November 25, 1942, and with him arrived in England in January 1943 carrying a letter from the CC of the Communist Party and another from Charles Tillon, leader of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTPF). He spoke for the first time on the BBC on January 15, 1943. From then he represented the communists before the various successive bodies of Free France, but in September 1943 he could not accept a position as commissioner of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN) which was proposed by de Gaulle without the approval of Jacques Duclos, then the party's clandestine leader in occupied France. The Communist Party presented demands for the participation of communists in the provisional government. On April 4, 1944, a compromise was reached with the appointment of two communist commissioners, Fran√ßois Billoux as State Commissioner and Grenier as Air Commissioner.\nFollowing the amendment presented by Fernand Grenier on March 24, 1944, at the Provisional Consultative Assembly of Algiers, the right to vote for women was established in France with article 17 that states \"Women are voters and eligible under the same conditions as men\".\n\n\n=== Post-war and later career ===\nFernand Grenier represented the PCF in the Provisional Consultative Assembly until October 1945, when he was re-elected deputy for the Sena in the Constituent Assembly, a deputy seat he held until 1968. He was part of the central committee of the PCF until May 1964. In September 1950, together with Denise Ginollin, he went to the Ministry of the Interior to inquire Eug√®ne Thomas for clarification about the ban on certain books and magazines from the USSR as well as the newspaper of the Unified Socialists of Catalonia Lluita.\nAs a member of the National Committee Franco-USSR Association, Grenier remained pro-Soviet until the end of his life. He died in Saint-Denis and was buried at the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

The race was held on Friday, April 26, 2024, at Dover Motor Speedway in Dover, Delaware, a 1-mile (1.6 km) permanent asphalt oval shaped speedway. The race took the scheduled 150 laps to complete. In an action-packed race, Connor Zilisch, driving for Pinnacle Racing Group, would survive the chaos that occurred with the leaders, and dominated the final stages of the race, leading the final 42 laps to earn his first career ARCA Menards Series win, his first career ARCA Menards Series East win, and his first career win in total. Pole-sitter William Sawalich and Gio Ruggiero dominated the majority of the race, with Sawalich leading a race-high 67 laps and Ruggiero leading 41 laps. Sawalich was involved in an incident with under 50 laps to go, and was unable to continue the race, finishing 17th. Ruggiero rebounded from a late-race penalty to finish in 2nd. To fill out the podium, Carson Kvapil, driving for Pinnacle Racing Group, would finish in 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDover Motor Speedway is an oval race track in Dover, Delaware, United States that has held at least two NASCAR races since it opened in 1969. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the NTT IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete oval, with 24¬∞ banking in the turns and 9¬∞ banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Speedway Motorsports.\nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice session was held on Friday, April 26, at 12:40 PM EST, and would last for 45 minutes.

        "content": "Huguette Dagenais (born 1943) is a French-Canadian anthropologist who until her retirement headed the feminist studies program at Universit√© Laval in Quebec City. From 1988 to 1997, she was co-founder and director of the journal Recherches f√©ministes. Together with Denise Piche, she edited an extensive volume of 18 papers on women and feminism published in 1994 as Women, Feminism and Development: Femmes, feminisme et ddveloppement.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Montreal in 1943, Huguette Dagenais studied athropology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al with a bachelor's degree in 1968 and a master's in 1969. She went on to study in Paris, earning a doctorate from the Paris Descartes University in 1976.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn parallel with her role as an academic at the Universit√© Laval, Dagenais carried out extensive research into social gender relationships, feminist analyses and related international developments. She has traveled frequently to the Caribbean, investigating the relationship between women's work and fertility (between 1967 and 1993) and from 1997 she participated in project researching social sciences and humanities research between Canadian and Vietmanese universities. This was followed from 1999 to 2004 by her coordination of a Canadian International Development Research Centre project researching social gender relationships and sustainable development in Vietnam,\nIn 2002, Dagenais commented that the inclusion of women's studies in Quebec universities presented major difficulties in the late 20th century although the situation had improved in the new millennium. The fragile situation had impacted the study of both science and politics. \nIn 1986, Dagenais co-founded and became the first coordinator of the multidiciplinaary feminist research group \"Groupe de recherche multidisciplinaire f√©ministe\" (GREMF) and in 1986 she helped to establish the international journal Recherches f√©ministes which she edited until 1997. In 1994, together with Denise Piche, she edited an extensive volume of 18 papers on women and feminism published as Women, Feminism and Development: Femmes, feminisme et ddveloppement.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ploeotia is a genus of heterotrophic flagellates belonging to the Euglenida, a diverse group of flagellated protists in the phylum Euglenozoa. Species of Ploeotia are composed of rigid cells exhibiting two flagella. The genus was described by F√©lix Dujardin in 1841.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPloeotia is a genus of flagellates, single-celled eukaryotes or protists that move using flagella. They have two flagella of different lengths. Like all euglenids, cells of Ploeotia have a pellicle underneath the cell membrane composed of spiralling protein stripes. In some euglenids, such as euglenophytes and peranemids, the number of stripes is high enough that the cells are very flexible and can exhibit a unique movement knowwn as metaboly. In more basal euglenids, such as petalonemids and ploeotids (including Ploeotia), the number of stripes is low (10 or 12), which makes the cells significantly more rigid.\n\n\n== Taxonomic history ==\nThe genus Ploeotia was described by French protozoologist Dujardin in his 1841 work Histoire naturelle des zoophytes. In 2016, American protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith created the family Ploeotiidae to include only Ploeotia, within the order Ploeotiida and class Ploeotarea which also included the genus Lentomonas. At the same time, the closely related genus Serpenomonas was transferred into another monotypic family, Serpenomonadidae, within a completely different class.\nAll of these higher taxa were reinterpreted in 2019, when phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that Ploeotia and Serpenomonas were more closely related to each other than to the rest of euglenids, including Lentomonas. Consequently, the class Ploeotarea and order Ploeotiida were deemed polyphyletic, and the family Ploeotiidae was modified to include Ploeotia and Serpenomonas. Both genera belong to a basal clade of euglenids known as Alistosa, along with other genera such as Lentomonas, Decastava and Keelungia. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic placement of Ploeotia within euglenids:\n\n\n== References ==",

The helmet was intended to replace older steel helmets wz. 50 and wz. 67. The shape of the shell is quite original, the liner is made of artificial leather dyed black. The helmet was painted green and came in two sizes: small (M) and large (D). The wz. 93 helmet can be fitted with camuflaged helmet covers (wz. 89 Puma and wz. 93 Pantera).\nThe wz. 93 produced by Bella company is certified by WITU and the German Shooting Research Center in Mellrichstadt No. B-940049.\n\n\n== Users ==\n Poland: Used by Polish Army until 2000s. Replaced by the wz. 2000 and wz. 2005.\n Russia: Helmet \"KIRASA-–ë–®-–≠\" made by Kirasa Company is a direct copy of the Polish wz. 93 helmet.

        "content": "L. Adele Cuinet (November 29, 1855 ‚Äì November 21, 1933) was a pioneer American dental surgeon, being the first woman dentist in Brooklyn, New York. Since childhood, she was a suffragist.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLouise Ad√®le Cuinet was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, November 29, 1855. She was of French parentage, her parents being L. Constant and Zenobia (Humbert) Cuinet. On the maternal side, she was a descendant of the Huguenot Humberts, a family of local eminence in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, where they bought refuge in the 16th century. Adele's mother was a suffragette.\n\nUpon her decision to adopt dentistry as a profession, Cuinet realized that, in addition to the ordinary obstacles presented to youth and inexperience, she might also encounter the prejudice which confronts every woman who ventures upon a career considered at the time to be the exclusive province of men. She therefore determined to thoroughly equip herself. She completed the course at the Model School, Trenton, New Jersey, in 1881. She also studied for two years with a prominent dentist in New York City, preparatory to entering, in 1881, the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. That institution graduated one woman about 26 years prior and then closed its doors against women for eight years, until Dr. Truman became dean. Cuinet graduated from that school (D.D.S., 1885), in high standing, taking one of the first places in a class of 59.\nLater, she returned to school, studying law and graduating from the Woman's Law Class of New York University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFor the first 25 years of her practice, Cuinet was the only woman in New York City who belonged to city's Dental Society and the only Doctor of Dental Surgery in New York. She owned a four-story, 18 room brownstone in Brooklyn Heights with offices on the bottom floors, and her home on the upper ones.\nShe was the one woman belonging to the Second District Dental Society of New York, and the only one practicing in Brooklyn. Cuinet lectured for several years to nurses of Memorial Hospital for Women and Children on hygiene of mouth and care of teeth.\nCuinet was a writer of ability and contributed much to the literature of her day. She was the author of various articles for newspapers and magazines.\nIn 1893, Cuinet was a delegate to the Dental Convention, World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois. In 1928, she created the Brooklyn Hoover/Curtis Women's Constitutional Committee, which later became the L. A. Cuinet Civic Association. In 1930, she traveled through China and studied conditions on behalf of the YMCA.\nInvolved in the woman's suffrage movement since childhood, Cuinet and her partner, Dr. Helene Lassen, were leaders of Brooklyn's suffrage movement.\n\nShe was a member of the Physicians and Surgeons branch of the Woman's Political Equality League, Women's Suffrage Party, Women's Political Union, People's Equality League of Brooklyn.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDr. Helene Lassen was Cuinet's life-long partner.\nIn religion, Cuinet was Episcopalian. She purchased land a built a waterfront home in Asharoken, Long Island where political and medical people would mingle.\nCuinet traveled abroad four or five times before her retirement in 1923, after 32 years of practice. In that year, her plans were for an elaborate trip, sailing for Algiers, spending several weeks in the African deserts, and then on to Tunis, and then to Egypt, sailing up the Nile and visiting the Egyptian temples. From there, here itinerary included Sicily, then Italy, Switzerland and Austria, and a flight from Paris to London. Most of the traveling on the European continent would be by automobile. In Africa, the travel was to be by caravans. In the summer of 1925, she toured the U.S., the route being by way of Pittsburgh, Cleveland. Chicago, Milwaukee, Saint Paul, Minnesota; Yellowstone National Park, Spokane, and Portland, Oregon. On the return trip, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Cheyenne, Denver, Kansas City, Missouri, and St. Louis were on the itinerary. In 1930, Cuinet was in China talking about the opium problem and researching ways to curb it in the U.S.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nL. Adele Cuinet died in Brooklyn, November 21, 1933. Burial was at that city's Green-Wood Cemetery.\nThe Cuinet Civic League, the civic association for Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn, was named in her honor.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Louise Adele Cuinet at Wikisource",

        "content": "The Nasser Hospital mass graves were discovered on 20 April 2024 by Palestinian families returning to Nasser Hospital after the withdrawal of Israeli forces following the Nasser Hospital siege, a major event in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the start of the war, Israel has attacked, damaged or destroyed nearly every hospital in the Gaza Strip. In January 2024, the Gaza Health Ministry said that 40 bodies were buried inside the hospital due to \"the siege on the neighbourhoods close to Nasser [Hospital]\". A Nasser Hospital official had told journalists in January that hospital staff had buried around 150 bodies in the hospital's yard.\nThe hospital was shelled multiple times throughout the war and received significant international media coverage after the death of a 13-year-old amputee, Donia Abu Mohsen, who had survived a previous Israeli airstrike that had killed her entire family. Nasser Hospital was reported to be non-functional after a February Israeli raid.\nIsraeli soldiers entered the hospital on 15 February 2024 from the south, destroying tents and bulldozing a mass grave. Israel stated it exhumed and examined some 400 corpses looking for Israeli hostages.\nDue to power outages during the entry of Israeli soldiers into the hospital, five patients in the hospital died. On 18 February, the World Health Organization said the hospital could no longer serve its patients, and that the hospital was no longer functional. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the hospital's inability to continue operating to the Israeli siege and raid.\nAs of 23 February, the hospital no longer had food, water or oxygen for patients. The Gaza Health Ministry attributed thirteen patient deaths to the lack of electricity and oxygen at the hospital.\nMass graves had previously been discovered at Al-Shifa Hospital after the siege there ended earlier in 2024.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe mass graves were discovered within the hospital itself after the retreat of Israeli soldiers in April 2024. Local officials stated that several of the bodies were found with their hands and feet bound. The casualties include children and elderly women. Some bodies were also found buried under piles of waste.\nBy 22 April, 283 bodies had been recovered from one mass grave, while rescue workers reported two additional graves had yet to be exhumed. 42 bodies were identified. A spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that there were ‚Äúallegedly older people, women and wounded‚Äù among the dead and others that had their hands tied and were stripped of clothes. A spokesman for Palestinian Civil Defense said some of the bodies found were handcuffed, shot in the head or wearing detainee uniforms. The Palestinian civil defense said that the 283 bodies were from a temporary burial area dug during the siege. People were not able to access cemeteries at the time and buried the dead in the hospital yard. The group said that some of the casualties were from the siege and others were from the raid.\nOn 25 April, Palestinian journalist Akram al-Satarri reported that many of the bodies that continue to be unearthed show signs of torture, mutilation, and summary execution. Some bodies also still had medical devices attached from their stay in the hospital. The three mass graves were thought to contain a total of about 700 bodies.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nUnited Nations rights chief Volker T√ºrk said that he was \"horrified\" by the site and called for an international investigation. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said the attack indicated \"serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\"\nThe Israeli Defence Forces said the accusations of them causing the killings were \"baseless and unfounded.\" The IDF said that during its operation \"in the area of Nasser Hospital, in accordance to the effort to locate hostages and missing persons, corpses buried by Palestinians in the area of Nasser Hospital were examined.\" They further stated that \"Bodies examined, which did not belong to Israeli hostages, were returned to their place.\" Sky News published an analysis of satellite imagery and social media footage of mass graves dug by Palestinians during Israel's siege, which were later bulldozed by the IDF.\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation called for a probe into the mass graves, terming them \"a war crime, a crime against humanity, and organised state terrorism\". A spokesperson for Al-Haq stated, \"Initial reports from Nasser Hospital show that some of the bodies of the killed people had their hands tied behind their back\". Geoffrey Robertson, an international lawyer and professor, called for an investigation, stating, \"It's a crime against humanity. This case cries out for an independent inquiry. And the sooner, the better.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGaza Strip mass graves\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edward Clere (1536‚Äì1606) was an English landowner and politician, serving as Member of Parliament for Thetford and Grampound.\n\nHe was a son of John Clere of Ormesby. He was educated at the University of Louvain, Cambridge, and the Inner Temple. One of his older brothers died at Florence, and the other was killed at the battle of Pinkie in 1547. His father was killed fighting at Kirkwall in 1557. Clere inherited the manor of Blicking from Sir James Boleyn.\nEdward Clere entertained Elizabeth at his house at the former St. George's Priory, Thetford, during her Norfolk progress in 1578.\nClere wrote a description of the entertainment given to Elizabeth I at New Hall in September 1579 by the Earl of Sussex. She was greeted by a theatrical entertainment presenting Jupiter and a thunderstorm. The next day there was jousting. A sleeping knight was brought in a chariot led by a maiden, and appeared to be revived by the Queen. Elizabeth was given a horse, a cloak, and a riding safeguard for hunting the next day. In his letter to Bassingbourbe Gawdy, Clere explained the drama promoted the Anjou courtship.\nClere and Sir William Heydon had some responsibility for the defence of Norfolk in 1588.\nHe died in London and was buried at Blickling on 14 August 1606. His monument at St Andrews' Blickling has the heraldry of ten ancestors, claiming lineage from a spurious \"Clere Monte\", a companion of the Duke of Normandy.\nEdward Clere's papers and correspondence were auctioned in lots in 1866 as part of the collection of Sir John Fenn.\n\n\n== Marriages ==\nEdward Clere married twice. Firstly, Frances, daughter of Sir Richard Fulmerston of Ipswich. She died in March 1579. Secondly, in 1580, Agnes, daughter of Robert Crane of Chilton. She was the widow of John Smith of Halesworth, Francis Clopton of Melford, and Christopher Heydon (died 1579) of Baconsthorpe. His children included:\n\nEdward Clere (born 1564). He married (1) Margaret Yaxley, and (2) Agnes, who sold Blickling to Henry Hobart in 1616.\nFrancis Clere, knighted 1 July 1603, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wroth, in May 1603.\nFulmerston Clere\nGilbert Clere\nAgnes or Anne Clere, who married William Gilbert.\nTemperance Clere (1564‚Äì1589).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dumb bread is a traditional bread that originates from the Virgin Islands. The name \"dumb bread\" comes from the cooking technique called dum pukht, originating from India and brought to the Caribbean when the Indian indentured workers replaced the slaves. \nThis bread does not require any yeast. Ingredients include flour, water, butter, sugar, baking powder, salt, and milk; oftentimes, shredded coconut is also added to the dough. Sometimes, cornmeal may be used. The same dough can be used to make johnnycakes. The bread can be filled with cheddar cheese. It is served cut into triangles and often along with bush tea or coffee.\nOn Annaberg in Saint John, the docents will sometimes act as bakers and make dumb bread.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe dough is first made with the dry ingredients combined with butter then milk with shredded coconuts being optionally added. The dough is then kneeded and formed into a round loaf. The dough is then allowed to rest. It is then cooked in a skillet or dutch oven over hot coals with additional hot coals on top of the skillet lid to cook the bread from above and below. The bread is cooked until golden brown and sounding hollow when tapped. The bread requires a resting period after baking or it will be damp and doughy on the inside.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Capture of the frigate Kilduin was a brief altercation between Russian and Swedish forces during the beginning Russo-Swedish war of 1788-1790.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Swedish war of 1788-1790 had made the Swedish government timorous of their western coast as Russian and Danish ships there could pose a threat, the response to this threat was the deployment of several frigates. Onboard one of the deployed frigates, Bellona, was Johan Petter Ternstedt, he had been ordered to patrol the waters of Marstrand when he spotted the lightly manned Russian frigate Kilduin anchored in the direction of Skagen.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nUpon spotting the frigate, Johan Petter Ternstedt gathered 5 men and started rowing towards the Kilduin in the dark of night. After eventually reaching the ship, the Swedes silently attached their rowboat to the ship's hull and boarded the ship. Fighting soon broke out on the deck between the Swedes and the Russian sailors on deck watch with the latter quickly being overpowered. After the altercation, the Swedes quickly screwed down the ship's hatches so that the crew below deck would not be able to come out.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Kilduin was brought back to Marstrand with Johan Petter Ternstedt being deemed a hero. On board the ship were a lot of supplies which would aid Sweden in her war effort against Russia, which included 128 cannons, 16, 000 cannonballs, and 500 rifles  The 94-strong crew that was on board the frigate would be escorted to J√∂nk√∂ping by the Bohusl√§n Regiment.\nThe Kilduin would be in Swedish service for another 7 years before being sold in 1795.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRusso-Swedish War (1788-1790)\nBattle of Hogland\n\n\n== References ==",

She had a sister, Dorothea Glanville Blatchford, and a brother, Corrie; their three other brothers died in infancy.\nWinifred was warned by her father against marrying socialist politician Victor Grayson.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nIn 1910, Winifred became editor of Woman Worker, a monthly socialist magazine which changed its name to Women Folk that year. Her writing condemned the exploitation of the working classes: 'I do not want any woman to slave her life away in shrieking, dinning factories, so that I may wear a woollen gown.'\nDuring the early 1910s, Winifred also took over the book review column 'In the Library' in The Clarion, the socialist newspaper founded by her father. She often referred to the 'cosy nook' in her home where she read and wrote her book column, 'thus giving her readers instructions on how to take pleasure in reading as a lifestyle practice that belonged to the socialist home.'\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter the death of their mother in 1921, Winifred and her sister Dorothea lived with and cared for their father in Horsham, Sussex until his death in 1943.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Circassian Heritage Center in Circassian –ê–¥—ã–≥—ç –ö—ä—ã–∫I—ç–Ω—ã–≥—ä—ç –ì—É–ø—á—ç is a heritage site and visitor center that reviews the history and heritage of the Circassian people. In the center there is a museum that displays authentic items from the Circassian heritage, as well as an academic research institute for the study of the Circassians.\nThe center was established in 2010 by Zakaria Thawcho, Zohar Thawcho and Aibek Napso and is currently managed by the Kfar Kama local council.\nOn the site is the official Circassian Museum which was recognized as a heritage site by the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel and by the Landmarks Program.\n\n\n== The Official Circassian Museum ==\nThe Circassians ruled for thousands of years in the mountains of the northwest of the Caucasus, but in the new era they found themselves living in a diaspora around the world, including in Israel. The official Circassian museum presents the story of the Circassian people.\nThe Circassian Museum is housed in an old house built at the end of the 19th century and is located in the heart of the old neighborhood of Kfar Kama. The building, which was the home of the Shahlacho family, one of the oldest families in the village and known to the public as the Beit Shami, underwent general building conservation and was adapted to the needs of the museum. All of its components as a Circassian house have been beautifully preserved, and are used today for illustration, such as: the foyer, the kitchen, the special guest room, cistern, inner rooms and the wing that is used today as a space for the museum displays which was the backyard that existed as an integral part of every house Circassian, as well as the high wall around the building, built entirely of black basalt stones.\nThe exhibition wing is rich and contains extremely rare items originating from the Caucasus Mountains, such as the special weapons of the Circassian knight, his clothes and the variety of equipment he used in his preparation for battle. Also displayed are the colorful clothes of the Circassian woman together with other items of clothing, fabrics with special embroidery (handicraft) and bead ornaments, as well as the Circassian musical instruments and more. Some of the most interesting exhibits are the cradle and the walker, which were used in the past to raise babies and prepare them for independence from a young age. The most impressive exhibit in the museum is \"hard Circassian cheese\" which was produced in 1980 in the shape of a Circassian dagger and is the oldest cheese in Israel. According to the Circassian tradition, it was customary to smoke the cheeses in the hearth for three weeks to bring it to a state where the cheese would be preserved and edible for many years. The cheese was prepared by the Bejadoj family in Jordan and was brought to Israel in 2010 by Aibek Napso.\nThe visit to the museum includes a lecture on the Circassian language, watching the film \"Circassian Heritage\" and a guided tour of the museum rooms accompanied by a local guide who explains the various exhibits in Hebrew, English, Russian, Arabic and Circassian. This is one of the few museums in the world where every visitor receives a close guide who accompanies him throughout the tour even if it is a couple of visitors. This policy of the Circassian Heritage Center to attach a guide to each visitor is part of the importance of spreading the Circassian culture in Israel and around the world.\n\n\n== The establishment of the Circassian Heritage Center ==\nIn 2010, the Kfar Kama local council decided to open a tender for the establishment of a \"Circassian Heritage Center\" which will serve as a visitor center containing a Circassian museum. The Council put Beit Shami for the winner of the tender for the purpose of establishing a heritage center within it. In May 2010, a contract was signed between the founders of the Circassian Museum, who won the tender, and the Kfar Kama local council, in which the winner will operate the Circassian Heritage Center for 5 years until 2015. At the end of the contract, the tenants were given an extension to continue operating the Heritage Center until 2019, when the local council Kfar Kama decided not to renew the contract with the tenants and thus end the contract with them and return the heritage center to the public authority.\n\n\n== The Circassian Heritage Center Today ==\nToday the Circassian Heritage Center is managed and maintained by the Kfar Kama local council and serves as an international Circassian Heritage Center and as a public visitor center and is owned by the local council. The center receives thousands of visitors every month who are exposed to the history and culture of the Circassian people. On holidays and record events of the local authority, the Heritage Center puts on a holiday and combines colorful dance performances, the most important of which is the annual Circassian festival that takes place every year in July. Also, various cultural events such as Circassian Heritage Week, memorial ceremonies for the Circassian Genocide and local landmarks, among them bicycle event of Kfar Kama  (Sovev Kfar Kama ), are held at the Circassian Heritage Center.\n\n\n== Tourism achievements ==\nThanks to the many activities of the Circassian Heritage Center in the development and promotion of tourism in Kfar Kama at the world level. In 2022, the settlement of Kfar Kama was declared among the 32 tourist villages recommended to visit by the UNWTO United Nations World Tourism Organization. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nThe Circassin in Israel, ◊¢◊®◊ï◊• ◊î◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ I24 NEWS,by I24 NEWS\nWho ARE these people? , I24 NEWS,India International\n◊ô◊ë◊ú◊ê◊®, The tourist site of Kfar Kama ]\nThe recommended tourist village to visit for 2022 by UNWTO, Visit Kfar Kama,\nkfar kama at UNWTO official site recognition, Visit Kfar Kama,",

        "content": "Di√°rio de S. Paulo is a Brazilian newspaper published in the city of S√£o Paulo. It was founded in 1884 and called Di√°rio Popular until 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter founding and working as director and editor of Correio Paulistano for almost twenty years, Am√©rico de Campos joined his colleagues Jos√© Maria Lisboa and Rangel Pestana to found A Prov√≠ncia de S. Paulo in 1875. In 1884, Campos and Lisboa were fired by the new partner of A Prov√≠ncia, Jo√£o Alberto Salles, after protesting against the new editorial policy imposed by him, which was anti-Lusitanian. At the end of 1884, Campos and Lisboa founded the Di√°rio Popular with the financial support of Ant√¥nio Bento, an abolitionist and owner of the Jornal do Commercio de S√£o Paulo, Hip√≥lito Junior and Aristides Lobo. The name was inspired by the Portuguese newspaper of the same name. In the first issue, the founders announced their editorial line:[...] We don't have a schedule; compromises that can fail are worth nothing, and besides, the ideas of the founders of the Di√°rio Popular are well known and their individualities are well worth a schedule. The long practice of men and things has taught us the precise independence and moderation that will be the norm in the discussions we engage in. All fair complaints made by competent people will be addressed and publicized. We will openly publish scientific, literary and political articles of recognized merit. The editorial section will be open to all opinions, requiring, as usual, the responsibility of the author and morality in the writings. We will not accept \"straw men\".The newspaper's first headquarters, located on Imperatriz Street, hosted several meetings between politicians at the end of the 19th century, who debated abolitionist and republican ideas. Originally an evening paper (the first in S√£o Paulo), it was characterized by being a newspaper of advertisements for small businesses. The advertising desk used to be crowded with people writing their own ads. It had a reasonable circulation and a solid financial situation. Given its \"popular\" nature, it used to receive and mediate donations for the poor and participated in several charity campaigns.\nAfter the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil, which it supported, Di√°rio Popular gained great popularity. Aristides Lobo was appointed Minister of the Interior in the provisional government, Am√©rico de Campos was appointed Brazilian consul to the Kingdom of Italy and Jos√© Maria Lisboa was elected state representative for S√£o Paulo. While Lobo and Campos left the newspaper to pursue political careers, Lisboa resigned and became the sole owner of Di√°rio Popular.\n\n\n=== Paranapanema River Campaign ===\nIn 1977, Di√°rio Popular began a campaign against the installation of the Braskraft paper mill in Angatuba, on the banks of the Paranapanema River, given the high risk of pollution of the river by the project. Led by editorial secretary Edgard Barros and reporter Ane do Valle, the campaign sparked a reaction from other newspapers and the authorities, who went from defending the project to criticizing it. A CPI was opened by the S√£o Paulo Legislative Assembly and Braskraft gave up on the project and settled in Paran√°. Currently, the Paranapanema is one of the cleanest rivers in Brazil.\n\n\n=== Acquisition by Orestes Qu√©rcia ===\nIn the 1980s, Di√°rio Popular went up for sale. By 1987, the financial situation was critical. At the same time, the S√£o Paulo State Government began to invest more in advertising in the newspaper. In October 1987, a report in O Estado de S. Paulo indicated that the Di√°rio received 11.1% of the S√£o Paulo government's advertising spending that year.\nIn May 1988, Rodrigo Lisboa Soares, great-grandson of Jos√© Maria Lisboa, announced the sale of the Di√°rio to Ary Carvalho, owner of the newspaper O Dia, for Cz$244 million. However, there were rumors that the real buyer was Orestes Qu√©rcia, the governor of S√£o Paulo, who denied the purchase until he left public office in March 1991, when he announced that he had acquired a 30% stake in the newspaper. In the 2000s, Qu√©rcia revealed that he had bought the Di√°rio Popular in 1988 in partnership with Carvalho. Between 1995 and 1998, Qu√©rcia's group invested R$35 million in a new printing system for the newspaper.\n\n\n=== Infoglobo and final years ===\nIn 2001, Di√°rio Popular was acquired by Infoglobo, which also owns the newspapers O Globo and Extra. The group wanted a newspaper in the S√£o Paulo region and changed the title to Di√°rio de S. Paulo, the same name as the newspapers launched in 1865 and 1929 by Assis Chateaubriand and owned by Di√°rios Associados. Infoglobo presented an editorial line less popular and police-oriented for the newspaper. On October 15, 2009, businessman Jos√© Hawilla, owner of the Bom Dia newspaper chain, sports marketing company Traffic and TV TEM, acquired the newspaper, as well as the printing facilities located in Osasco. On September 2, 2013, Traffic sold control of the newspaper to the Cereja Comunica√ß√£o Digital group. After going through financial and administrative problems with the new management, Di√°rio de S. Paulo was declared bankrupt by the 2nd Bankruptcy Court of S√£o Paulo on January 23, 2018, with both the print version and the online portal ceasing to circulate.\n\n\n=== Current owner ===\nIn October 2019, businessman Kl√©ber Moreira announced the purchase of the newspaper from Cereja Comunica√ß√£o Digital group for R$30,000 and reactivated the online and print versions. Despite the announcement, the editions were produced by plagiarizing articles from other outlets. There is no data on its print circulation at the Instituto Verificador de Comunica√ß√£o.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nExxonMobil Journalism Award ‚Äì Esso Photography Award (1987) to Luiz Luppi for \"Resid√™ncia ou Morte\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nEstad√£o\nFolha de S.Paulo\nBrazilian press\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the newspaper Di√°rio de S.

        "content": "One Second Champion (Chinese: ‰∏ÄÁßíÊã≥Áéã) is a 2021 Hong Kong sports film directed by Chiu Sin Hang, marking his second feature film project after Vampire Cleanup Department (2017). Chiu also takes on a lead role, alongside Endy Chow, Chanon Santinatornkul, and Lin Min Chen, portraying an asthmatic heir of a boxing gym who transforms a gambling addict with an ability to see one second into the future (played by Chow) into a professional boxer.\nThe film premiered as the closing film of Hong Kong Asian Film Festival on November 22, 2020, and was theatrically released on March 11, 2021, in Hong Kong. It was named a Film of Merit in the 27th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards and received four nominations in the 40th Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nChow Tin Yan is a child prodigy with the ability to foresee one second into the future due to his one-second-long heartbeat pause at birth. He is coerced by his father into cheating in gambling. Unfortunately, his foresight is of no use at the gambling table as it only provides limited advantages, leading his father to consider him useless.\nYears later, as a grown-up, Chow becomes addicted to gambling to raise money for his hearing-impaired son, Chi Leung's surgery. He works at a pub and faces debt collectors one day. To evade their attacks, Chow utilizes his foreseeing ability, deftly dodging their punches and causing them to stumble or hit each other. Witnessing Chow's talents, Yip Chi Shun, a boxer and heir to a struggling boxing gym, approaches Chow and recruits him as his sparring partner. With his pub job lost after the altercation with the debt collectors, Chow agrees to join Yip and begins training the next day. However, his laziness and quick exhaustion raise doubts in Yiu, Yip's cousin and yoga instructor at the gym, about Chow's usefulness to Yip's training. Nevertheless, Chow's dedication and energy increase when his son, Chi Leung, accompanies him to the gym.\nYip eventually enters an open championship but succumbs to asthma, forcing him to withdraw after only half a round. Dissatisfied with the lack of excitement from their gym's fighters, both the opponent and audience express their disappointment. Yip then asks Chow to replace him as the gym's representative, to which Chow reluctantly agrees. Despite being a novice with amateur moves, Chow's foreseeing ability helps him dodge most punches and deliver a powerful blow to his opponent, securing victory. Encouraged by his talent in boxing, Chow decides to become a boxer at Yip's gym, engaging in tough training. With his boxing skills improving significantly and his one-second foreseeing ability, he advances through the preliminaries until the finals, where he faces a formidable opponent, Sung Ngo Yeung. Despite Sung's aggressive attacks, Chow skillfully evades every move, including a surprise head punch. Suspicious of Chow's uncanny abilities, Sung investigates and discovers his one-second foreseeing power. He lodges a complaint with the boxing association, resulting in Chow's disqualification according to the association's guidelines on body standards.\nMeanwhile, Joe, a champion boxer, finds himself without funding after unintentionally killing an opponent. Desperate for an exhibition match to attract new investments, Joe's coach approaches Chow, considering his foreseeing ability as a gimmick. However, Sung confronts Chow that night, accusing him of stealing the opportunity to fight Joe and winning matches solely based on his ability rather than hard work. During their argument, Chi Leung, frightened, rushes onto the road, and in an attempt to save him, Chow is struck by a van, losing his foreseeing ability in the accident. Sung apologizes to Chow, and with Chi Leung's encouragement, Chow resolves to continue fighting against Joe, pushing through grueling training.\nHowever, Chow initially struggles to match Joe's skill and finds himself at a significant disadvantage in the first two rounds of the match against Joe. Joe grows contemptuous of Chow, perceiving him as too weak. Undeterred, Chow displays exceptional endurance and determination, repeatedly standing up despite Joe's relentless attacks. The two fighters endure until the tenth round, both sustaining severe injuries. Chow's evolution throughout the match allows him to dodge Joe's final blows, almost as if he has regained his foreseeing ability, and persists until the match's final bell. As he teeters on the brink of collapse from his injuries, Joe rushes over to steady him, having earned Chow's respect through their bout. Although Chow ultimately loses the match in terms of score, he celebrates joyfully with his son and newfound friends.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nEndy Chow as Chow Tin Yan: a gamble addict-turned-boxer who can see one second into the future and desperately needs funding for his hearing-impaired son's surgery.\nChanon Santinatornkul as Joe Cheng Yiu Jo: a Thai boxing champion.\nChiu Sin Hang as Yip Chi Shun: a boxing fanatic and the heir of a boxing gym who suffers from asthma.\nLin Min Chen as Yiu: the cousin of Yip and the potential love interest of Chow who teaches yoga at Yip's boxing gym.\nJustin Cheung as Sung Ngo Yeung: a high-ranking boxer with the nickname \"Iron Hammer\".\nHung Cheuk Lok as Chow Chi Leung: the hearing-impaired son of Chow Tin Yan.\nActors credited as special appearances include Lo Hoi-pang as the barkeeper of the pub where Chow works; Ben Yuen as Master Cheung, the coach of Joe and a respected member of the boxing association; Wong You-nam as Chow Tin Yan's father; and Kaki Sham as a policeman. Babyjohn Choi made a cameo appearance as a janitor which resembles his character in another Chiu Sin Hang's film Vampire Cleanup Department. \n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nFollowing the conclusion of filming Vampire Cleanup Department, director Chiu Sin Hang was inspired by the soundtracks of Rocky and decided to write a heart-lifting story about boxing. This idea eventually evolved into One Second Champion prior to the 2019-20 Hong Kong protests. In 2019, Endy Chow was invited to join the project and accepted the role due to his desire to film a boxing movie. Lin Min Chen, the lead actress of Vampire Cleanup Department, was also invited by Chiu to star in the film, and she accepted the role on spot after reading the script. Both Chiu and Chow, the two lead actors, underwent six months of boxing training and followed a strict diet in preparation for filming. The film was officially announced in August 2019, and production took place during the protests. Chiu stated that the crew incorporated the emotions triggered by the social atmosphere into the film. In October 2019, Thai actor Chanon Santinatornkul was cast in the film, marking his first international action film project. He learned boxing and Cantonese specifically for the film. An official trailer was released in November 2020, revealing Lo Hoi-pang, Ben Yuen, Justin Cheung, and child actor Hung Cheuk Lok as part of the cast.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on August 30, 2019. The majority of the scenes were filmed in Tai Po, which included interior shots of Yip's boxing gym and the pub where Chow worked, as well as at the Yan Hing Street Refuse Collection Point. Scenes depicting Chow jogging and conversing with Yiu were shot at Ma Liu Shui and Sam Mun Tsai, respectively. While filming the final match between Chow and Santinatornkul, Chow sustained an injury to his forehead and required twelve stitches. However, he returned to the set without resting to ensure that the filming schedule would not be delayed. Filming ultimately wrapped on September 30, 2019.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOne Second Champion premiered as the closing film of the Hong Kong Asian Festival on November 22, 2020. Initially, the film was scheduled to have five days of early screenings from November 28 to December 2, 2020, followed by a theatrical release on December 3 in Hong Kong. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government shut down the cinemas on December 2, leading to a postponement of the release date to March 11, 2021. The film was also selected for screening in the 23rd Far East Film Festival.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nOne Second Champion grossed over HK$3 million in its first weekend and reached HK$7 million by the second week, maintaining its box office dominance for eight consecutive days. The film surpassed the HK$10 million mark within the third week, and ultimately accumulated a total of HK$15.56 million, surpassing Beyond the Dream as the highest-grossing domestic film during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film's box office run concluded at HK$17 million, making it the second highest-grossing domestic film of 2021.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nEdmund Lee of South China Morning Post gave the film 3/5 stars and recognized the delivery of an ultimate underdog story with a rousing climax in the final boxing match, highlighting the energetic performances and standout moments from Chiu Sin Hang, Lin Min Chen, and Hung Cheuk Lok. Kwok Kar Peng of AsiaOne praised the film for its polished execution, well-developed characters, captivating cinematography during boxing matches, and its uplifting theme of underdogs transforming their lives through determination and shifts in perspective, making it a feel-good flick that offered a hopeful message. Yan Ki of Hong Kong Inmedia recommended the film for its engaging story, fast pacing, and Endy Chow's impressive performance, emphasizing its enjoyment factor beyond mere localness. Ho Siu Bun of am730 lauded the film with a decent level of quality, noting the director's improvement from his previous work, but also pointed out some shortcomings in the execution of comedy and the absence of dramatic elements.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOne Second Champion at IMDb",

Inside Connaught Place, the road connects to other important roads like Jantar Mantar Road, Janpath, Atul Grove Road, and Kasturba Gandhi Marg. Tolstoy Marg houses many commercial offices and offices of some Public Sector Enterprises as well.\nTolstoy Marg is usually the focal point of protest marches and other political rallies in the city. Political rallies towards Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, often passes through Tolstoy Marg.\n\n\n== History ==\nTolstoy Marg was constructed during the British era, when Robert Tor Russell was designing the Connaught Place. In those days it was named as Keeling Road, after Hugh Keeling, who was the Chief Engineer of Delhi.\nDuring the Partition of India in 1947, several Muslim families who were residents of Keeling Road, had moved to Pakistan, and likewise people coming to India from Pakistan had made Keeling road their new home.\nProminent leader Deshbandhu Gupta also used to live in a big house on Keeling Road. He was a resident of ‚Äú5, Keeling Road‚Äù.\nWhen the headquarters of Communist Party of India were shifted from Bombay to New Delhi in 1951, they were first housed on ‚Äú4, Keeling Road‚Äù.\nIn 1962, to meet the increasing need of commercial space in Central part of Delhi, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had decided to extend Connaught Place Commercial Area up to the Keeling Road. It was done under ‚ÄúDelhi Master Plan 1962‚Äù.\nThis road was renamed as Tolstoy Marg in 1968. \nDuring Soviet era, Information Department of the USSR Embassy in India, was situated nearby on 25, Barakhamba Road of New Delhi. Soviet Airlines Aeroflot had an office on Tolstoy Marg, which is currently shifted to nearby Barakhamba Road.\n\n\n== Tolstoy statue and Tolstoy House ==\n\nOn the sidewalk of a road where Tolstoy Marg meets  Janpath, there stands a black colored bronze statue of Leo Tolstoy, that was installed here in 1994. This statue was constructed in USSR in 1989.  However it was only after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, that the statue was finally installed on the Tolstoy Marg. This statue was inaugurated by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in 1994 during his visit to India. \nThis statue faces a heritage building ‚ÄúFreemasons Hall‚Äù which is situated on the Janpath Road, and this building was constructed in the year 1936.\nThe Tolstoy Statue on this road often witnesses the gathering of the fans of Russian Literature, Leo Tolstoy, and Mahatma Gandhi.\nPresently a building called Tolstoy House is also situated on this road.\n\n\n== Notable establishments ==\nNotable establishments on Tolstoy Marg include:\n\nState Trading Corporation of India (STC).\nSmall Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Secure the Base: Making Africa Visible in the Globe  is a 2016 book by Kenyan author Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o. The book addresses the issues of  Africa's historical relationship with capitalism, the impact of slavery and colonialism, and the role of African intellectuals in fostering social change. He critiques the reductionist portrayal of African conflicts, advocates for the recognition of historical injustices, and calls for the use of African languages in building the continent, Africa. Secure The Base discusses global issues of economic inequality and nuclear disarmament, calling for united African leadership and a more equitable global order.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNg≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o focus on the repercussions of both external and internal injustices inflicted upon African people. While emphasizing the significant impact of crimes imposed by external forces, particularly Africa's historical ties with the Western, he sheds light on internal challenges of the continent. He critically examines the language and narratives surrounding African conflicts, particularly tribes and its derivatives. In the book, he argues that these terms, rooted in a biological perspective, oversimplify complex issues and contribute to another understanding of the African societies. To him, by focusing solely on these divisions, such as ethnicity or tribal identity, without considering the historical context and socio-economic disparities imposed by colonialism, these conflicts are termed unsolvable. While he highlights the colonial legacy ending up in dividing communal identities and fostering uneven development within Africa, he analyses such conflicts exist in other parts of the world, which are limited to tribalism.\nThe second essay of the book was on Africa's historical interaction with capitalism. From the commodification of African bodies during the era of slavery to the exploitation of unpaid labor on slave plantations, he thus concluded Africa has long been subjected to economic exploitation. During the colonial period, he argued that Africa served primarily as the land source of raw materials, and the Europeans buying from them now is the vice-versa. European powers further perpetuated the economic subjugation. However, his argument included the wave of decolonization after the World War II. He analysed that many African countries ventured into financial houses like World bank, IMF, instead of achieving true independence.\nWa Thiong'o's analysis underscores the enduring legacy of colonialism and the persistent challenges that African nations face in asserting their economic sovereignty. By contextualizing Africa's economic struggles within a historical framework, he sheds light on the systemic inequalities and injustices that continue to shape the continent's development trajectory.\nAs Kingsley Moghalu cautiously questions the narrative of Africa as a frontier for capitalism, wa Thiong'o advocates for a united African leadership to foster more equitable global interactions.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nNg≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o's work delves deeply into the complex tapestry of African history, highlighting the enduring repercussions of both external colonial injustices and internal challenges. Central to his critique is the examination of language and narratives surrounding African conflicts, particularly the oversimplified notion of \"tribalism.\" By tracing the colonial legacy of economic exploitation and the imposition of neoliberal policies, Wa Thiong'o underscores the systemic inequalities facing African nations. He advocates for the revitalization of African languages as a means of decolonizing the mind and reconnecting with cultural roots. Moreover, his discourse extends to issues of moral accountability, emphasizing the historical links between slavery, debt servitude, and capitalist fundamentalism, while also stressing the imperative of nuclear disarmament and collective global action. Ultimately, Wa Thiong'o's work serves as a rallying call for African leadership to foster more equitable global interactions and challenge prevailing narratives that overlook deeper issues in the pursuit of economic growth.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Australian Civic Trust (ACT), formerly known as the Civic Trust of South Australia, is or was an Australian organisation promoting excellence in urban design. It was responsible for organising the Civic Trust Awards, last awarded in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nA 1967 symposium of the South Australian branch of the RAIA was known as the \"Outrage Symposium\" followed Australian architect Don Gazzard's speech and publication entitled Australian Outrage (1966). Gazzard had adopted the term used by British architectural critic Ian Nairn's critique of urban design entitled Outrage, and followed Australian architect Robin Boyd's criticism of Australian design in his book The Australian Ugliness (1960). At the Outrage Symposium, a steering committee was set up to establish a new body focused on urban design in South Australia. This committee first met on 6 October 1967, and decided to found a scheme based on the UK Civic Trust Awards. \n\n\n=== Civic Trust history ===\nThe Civic Trust of South Australia Inc. was established in 1969, and became incorporated in 1992 or 1993. It published under the name Civic Trust Inc. from 2005 to April 2007, with a name change to Australian Civic Trust Inc. by the December 2007.\nIn 2014, the Civic Trust called for the establishment of a social history museum on the site of the former Royal Adelaide Hospital site (now Lot Fourteen).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Australian Civic Trust (ACT) supports civic issues relating to urban design, including heritage issues and management of water resources. It sees social, environmental, and urban issues as all parts of a whole. It engages with the public to discuss such issues, and also collaborates with other groups, including government, in areas of great concern to the community.\n\n\n== People ==\nGordon Young was chairman of the Civic Trust of South Australia during the 1970s or 1980s. Michael Lennon, later chair of the State Planning Commission, spent two stints as chair.\nDarian Hiles, who was chair in 2014, was chair of the association and convenor of the awards in 2019.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Australian Civic Trust organises Civic Trust Awards to recognise projects that demonstrate \"innovation and public value\", as well as \"brickbats\". Members of the public submit nominations for both categories.\nIn the 1990s, the awards were known as Civic Trust Awards. At some point before 2015, after the name change to Australian Civic Trust, they changed to various named awards. \nSpecial awards given in the late 2010s include:\n\nColonel William Light Award for Excellence in Urban Design (after William Light, who planned the city of Adelaide)\nStuart Hart Award for City and Regional Planning\nAustralian Civic Trust Award for Raising the Profile of the Arts and Tourism\nHugh Stretton Award for Innovation in Residential Development (after historian Hugh Stretton)\nAustralian Civic Trust Award for Political Reform\nIan Macdonald Award for Best in the Urban Category\nBob Such Award for Design for Social Benefit (after SA politician Bob Such)\nIn 2019, there was also a Heritage Award, and the Silo Art Award category proved very popular.\nAs of 2024, the last \"Awards & Brickbats\" were presented on 13 November 2019.\n\n\n=== Some award-winners ===\n\n\n==== 1993 ====\nSwanbury Penglase Architects: Civic Trust Award, for the CSIRO Building in Kintore Avenue, Adelaide\nSwanbury Penglase Architects: Civic Trust Award, for ANZ Bank building in Gawler\n\n\n==== 1994 ====\nShannon Architects: Award of Merit ‚Äì Recycling, for  Noarlunga Community Arts Centre\n\n\n==== 1996 ====\nShannon Architects: Award of Merit ‚Äì  Buildings in their settings, for Australian Arid Lands Botanic Garden\n\n\n==== 2015 ====\nSwanbury Penglase Architects: Australian Civic Trust Colonel William Light Award for Excellence in Design, for Conservation of Elder Park Rotunda\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\nSwanbury Penglase Architects: Australian Civic Trust Colonel William Light Award for Excellence in Design, for work on the Queen Adelaide Room at Adelaide Town Hall\n\n\n==== 2019 ====\nSmyth Chapel at West Terrace Cemetery: Bob Such Award for Design for Social Benefit\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSLSA catalogue entry to archived items held by the library\n\"Sustaining our heritage : the story of Civic Trust awards and brickbats, 1971 to 1984 / by James Warburton.

He taught school for several years, first at the Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt and later at Jesuit schools in Vienna. He taught both public speaking and written composition. His sermons were popular. The sermon he preached on the coronation day of Emperor Joseph II (April 3, 1764) was subsequently printed. It brought Wurz to the attention of university administrators in Vienna and led to his appointed as professor of \"sacred eloquence\" at the University of Vienna's theology department. He remained in this post until in 1776, even after his order was abolished in 1773. Writing in 1850, Jakob Fluck ranked Wurz as the best teacher of Homiletics in the eighteenth century. \nHe retired to parish work, administering the parish of Pierawart in Lower Austria until he died.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nOde auf das hohe Geburtsfest Sr. K.

He has been irregularly competing in the World Cup since 2019.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTaras Lesiuk competed in his first international competition in December 2013 at the age of 17, participating in an IBU Cup sprint in Obertilliach. After that, he didn't appear again until 2015, when he started racing at the junior level. In early 2017, Lesiuk stood on the podium for the first time in the IBU Junior Cup with the relay team. Later that year, he won silver in the relay and the pursuit race at the Junior events of the Summer Biathlon World Championships, marking his only victory at the junior level. From the 2017/18 season onwards, Lesiuk consistently competed in the IBU Cup and quickly achieved results within the top 30. Two top-15 finishes in January 2019 earned him his debut in the World Cup at the overseas races in Canmore and Soldier Hollow. In his first race, the sprint in Canmore, he immediately scored World Cup points by finishing 32nd. He also competed in the relay race the following day, finishing seventh despite a penalty loop.\nLesiuk achieved his first top-10 placements in the IBU Cup at the end of the 2019/20 season. The following winter, he reached the podium for the first time with the relay team at Arber and improved his individual result in Obertilliach to fifth place. In the 2021/22 season, Lesiuk was initially part of the World Cup lineup again and achieved his first pursuit race at the highest level at the competitions in Le Grand-Bornand. Additionally, he finished sixth in the individual race at the European Championships 2022. At the beginning of the 2022/23 winter season, Lesiuk scored points in the individual, sprint, and pursuit races in Kontiolahti, each finishing exactly 40th three times in a row. His best season result in the World Cup was 29th place in the individual race in Ruhpolding, but he was reassigned to the IBU Cup for the European Championships, where he could achieve a tenth place in the sprint at the end of the winter.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Championships ===\n0 medals\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n=== European Championships ===\n0 medals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The Last Tycoon is a 1957 episode of the American television series Playhouse 90 based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nHumphrey Bogart expressed interest in appearing in the production opposite to Lauren Bacall but was ultimately too ill with the cancer that would kill him. The production was filmed in Los Angeles with some location work shot at Malibu Beach.  Director John Frankenheimer recalled:\n\nWe didn't try to improve on Fitzgerald. We stopped it where he stopped it. We left it with Monroe Stahr in his beach house knowing he was dying and we closed with a shot of Palance. I think the narrator says that Fitzgerald died before he finished the book. Some of the best dialogue in that show is not Fitzgerald, it's Don Mankiewicz. Jack Palance was superb. I remember that the night before the show he slept in the office because he wanted that office to be so much a part of him.\nFrankenheimer later worked with Palance on The Horsemen (1971).\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJack Palance as Monroe Stahr\nKeenan Wynn as Lou Myrick\nPeter Lorre as Pete Zavras\nViveca Lindfors as Kathleen Moore\nLee Remick as Cecelia Brady\nRobert F.

        "content": "Olga Alexandrovna Sadovskaya (born October 25, 1980, Gorky, RSFSR, USSR) is a Russian lawyer, human rights activist, deputy head, and head of the International Legal Protection Department of the Crew Against Torture, a Russian human rights organization specializing in investigations of torture cases. \nSince 2004, she has been a co-author of alternative reports to the UN Committee Against Torture.

Starting in 2003, she worked there as a lawyer, conducting analytical research on torture in Russia, handling cases in the European Court of Human Rights, and providing training on handling cases in international bodies.\nSince 2004, Olga Sadovskaya has been a co-author of alternative reports to the UN Committee Against Torture on compliance with the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\nIn 2009, she gave a lecture on human rights protection issues at Lobachevsky State University.\nIn 2009, Olga Sadovskaya participated in the international conference on human rights organized by the Human Rights Information and Documentation Centre (HURIDOCS) in Geneva, where she presented information on the situation regarding torture prevention in Russia.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, she was a member of the Public Monitoring Commission of Nizhny Novgorod Region.\nIn 2017, she took part in the international conference \"Defending Dissent: Civil Society and Human Rights in the Global Crackdown,\" organized by the Robert L. Bernstein Institute for Human Rights at New York University School of Law.\nOn March 28, 2019, Olga Sadovskaya participated in the international conference \"Crimes Against Human Dignity: Interaction of International and National Means of Protection\", organized in Moscow by the Council of Europe, the Federal Chamber of Advocates of the Russian Federation, and the International Commission of Jurists. At this conference, Olga Sadovskaya spoke about the necessity of prohibiting torture in the national legislation.\nFrom 2021 to 2022, as part of the Oak Human Rights Fellowship program, she taught two courses at Colby College in Waterville, USA: \"Incarceration and Human Rights\" and \"The European Court as a Trendsetter for Global Human Rights Standards\".\nIn 2023, Olga Sadovskaya became the only co-author from Russia of the Second Edition of the Istanbul Protocol.\nAs of October 2023, Olga Sadovskaya served as a trainer for the Human Rights Information and Documentation System HURIDOCS, conducting training seminars on the standards of the European Court of Human Rights for lawyers, law enforcement officials, and prosecutors.\n\n\n=== Important Cases in the European Court of Human Rights ===\nFrom 2002 to 2015, Olga and her colleagues from the Crew Against Torture submitted 84 complaints to the European Court of Human Rights, resulting in convictions for torture for over a hundred police officers and compensation for victims totaling nearly 46 million rubles (700,000 US dollars). In addition, the organization was involved in the evacuation of torture victims from Chechnya.\nIn 2018, two cases led by lawyers from the Torture Prevention Team were included in the collection \"Precedents of the European Court of Human Rights: 20 Most Important Cases that Changed the Russian Legal System\": the cases of Mikheev and Lyapin.\nOlga Sadovskaya personally represented the interests of over 300 torture victims at the European Court.\n\n\n==== Lapunov v. Russia ====\nOn March 15, 2017, Maxim Lapunov was detained by the police in Grozny and taken to a police station where he was subjected to torture. In May 2019, Lapunov filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), claiming that his case had been improperly investigated by Russian authorities. Olga Sadovskaya represented him before the ECHR. On September 12, 2023, the ECHR recognized that the applicant had been \"detained and subjected to ill-treatment by state agents,\" reaching the level of torture, which was committed \"solely because of his sexual orientation.\" The court awarded him compensation for moral damages amounting to 52,000 euros.\n\n\n==== Tepsurkaev v. Russia ====\nOn September 6, 2020, Salman Tepsurkaev was abducted and subjected to torture in Gelendzhik. Witnesses reported that the abductors showed identification documents of the police officers. In October 2021, the European Court of Human Rights, after reviewing the case, concluded that Russian authorities were responsible for violating Articles 3 and 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights - \"prohibition of torture\" and \"right to liberty and security,\" recognizing Mr. Tepsurkaev as a victim of abduction and torture and awarding compensation to his wife, who was recognized as a victim.\n\n\"The ECHR recognized that Salman became a victim of abduction and torture by state agents, namely Chechen law enforcement officers. He was unlawfully deprived of his freedom and subjected to cruel and degrading treatment, which was captured on video. The court found that the state failed to protect Salman.\" - Olga Sadovskaya.\n\n\n==== Novoselov v. Russia ====\nOn April 27, 2004, Alexander Novoselov, a resident of Nizhny Novgorod, was abducted by police officers and subjected to torture to give testimony in the case of Oleg Sorokin, the then-General Director of a group of companies \"Stolitsa Nizhny.\" Novoselov filed a statement to the prosecutor's office requesting the opening of a criminal case. However, the investigative body eventually refused to initiate a criminal case against the police officers. The prosecutor's office concluded that the incident in the forest was an operational experiment conducted by officers of the Main Department of Internal Affairs for Nizhny Novgorod Region. In May 2005, Novoselov turned to the Committee Against Torture. On December 24, 2005, lawyers from the Committee Against Torture filed a complaint with the ECHR on behalf of Alexander Novoselov, and it was accepted for consideration in 2008. On November 28, 2013, the ECHR recognized that Novoselov had been tortured by state representatives, and the investigation conducted by the prosecutor's investigation was \"superficial\" and \"formalistic.\" The European Court ordered Russia to pay Novoselov 27,500 euros.\n\n\n==== Anoshin v. Russia ====\nIn July 2002, Alexander Anoshin was taken to a medical sobering-up station in the Soviet District of Nizhny Novgorod, where he died on the same day due to asphyxiation. A criminal case was initiated because it was discovered that the man could not have received those injuries on his own. In February 2004, Elena Anoshina, the sister of the deceased, turned to the Committee Against Torture. As a result, the prosecutor's office initiated a case under Article 111, Part 4 of the Russian Criminal Code (infliction of grievous bodily harm resulting in the death of the victim due to negligence). The case was suspended 13 times. In 2005, human rights defenders filed a complaint with the ECHR, and suspects - police officers Alexey Maslov, Evgeny Ageev, and Andrey Antonov - appeared in the case. In 2008, a Russian court sentenced Maslov to 14 years in a strict regime colony for Article 105 of the Russian Criminal Code (murder) and Part 3 of Article 286 of the Russian Criminal Code (exceeding official powers with the use of violence). The case against Ageev and Antonov, who were accused under Part 2 of Article 293 of the Russian Criminal Code (negligence resulting in the death of the victim), was terminated due to the statute of limitations. On March 26, 2019, the ECHR awarded Elena Anoshina compensation in the amount of 36,600 euros, establishing that the Russian Federation violated Alexander Anoshin's right to life, and the investigation into his murder was ineffective.\n\n\n==== Dmitrievskiy v. Russia ====\nIn the mid-2000s, Dmitrievskiy led the organization \"Society of Russian-Chechen Friendship,\" which monitored human rights violations in the North Caucasus. He was also the chief editor of the newspaper \"Pravo-Zashchita,\" which was mainly distributed in his hometown of Nizhny Novgorod with a circulation of 5,000 copies. In 2004, the newspaper published appeals from Chechen separatist leaders Ahmed Zakayev and Aslan Maskhadov. In these texts, they accused the Russian leadership of instigating war and terrorism in Chechnya. In January 2005, the Nizhny Novgorod prosecutor's office initiated a criminal case against Dmitrievsky for calling for extremist activities (Article 280 of the Russian Criminal Code), finding calls for the violent overthrow of the constitutional order in these materials. The charges were later reclassified as calls for hatred or enmity (Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code). In February 2006, the Soviet District Court of Nizhny Novgorod sentenced Dmitrievsky to two years of conditional imprisonment with a four-year probation period. In the same year, Dmitrievsky appealed to the ECHR. The case was initiated after filing a complaint about violations of Article 10 of the European Convention on Freedom of Expression, as well as violations of Articles 6 and 13, which concern fair trial and effective legal remedies. On October 3, 2017, the ECHR ruled that Dmitrievsky's publications did not contain calls for the overthrow of the system or incitement to interethnic hatred and awarded him compensation of 13,600 euros. This was the first time the ECHR made a decision on a criminal case on extremism in Russia.\n\n\n==== A. v. Russia ====\nThis case was initiated by a complaint filed with the European Court of Human Rights against the Russian Federation in accordance with Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by a Russian citizen, A., on April 14, 2009. The Section Chairman granted the applicant's request for anonymity. Initially, the applicant was represented by her mother, and later by Olga Sadovskaya. The applicant claimed that the Russian authorities violated her rights under the convention by carrying out her father's violent detention in her presence in 2008 when she was 9 years old. In 2019, the ECHR deemed this complaint admissible, ruling that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in both its material and procedural aspects, and awarded 25,000 euros as compensation for moral damage.\n\n\n==== S.K. v. Russia ====\nThis case was initiated by a complaint filed with the ECHR against the Russian Federation in 2012. The applicant, a 20-year-old future mother at the time of the events, was forced by her parents to have an abortion after her partner and the future father of the child were arrested on suspicion of a serious crime. The medical intervention was performed by a duty doctor at a state hospital. In 2022, the court ruled that the respondent state had not properly investigated the incident and had direct responsibility for what had happened, and awarded the applicant 19,500 euros in compensation.\n\n\n==== V.K. v. Russia ====\nThe applicant claimed that at the age of 4, he had been subjected to cruel treatment by the staff of a state kindergarten. Medical experts established a causal link between the cruel treatment of the applicant by kindergarten staff and his current neurological disorder. In 2017, the ECHR ruled that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in its material part in connection with the cruel treatment of the applicant by kindergarten staff. It also ruled that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in its procedural part in connection with the authorities' failure to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant's complaints of cruel treatment. The ECHR ordered Russia to pay 3,000 euros for pecuniary damage and 25,000 euros for non-pecuniary damage.\n\n\n==== Al-Tbakhy v. Russia ====\nVisam Al-Tbakhy was detained on October 26, 2018, in Nizhny Novgorod and isolated for further deportation from Russia. Palestinian Visam Al-Tbakhy became a Russian citizen in 2001 and officially changed his documents within the prescribed period. In 2017, due to violations in the issuance of a Russian passport, the Federal Migration Service considered the document invalid and confiscated it along with the foreign passport. The court annulled Al-Tbakhy's Russian citizenship. He was denied regaining citizenship. It was decided to deport him for \"ensuring the security of the state\" for 30 years. Al-Tbakhy was deported from Russia in 2019. In this case, lawyers from the Committee Against Torture (CAT) identified several serious violations of several articles of the European Convention and filed a complaint with the ECHR. In 2022, the ECHR ruled that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and ordered Russia to pay Al-Tabahy 7,500 euros in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n\n\n==== Adzhigitova and Others v. Russia ====\nOn June 4, 2005, about a hundred unknown servicemen of the Russian Ministry of Defense stationed in Chechnya carried out an attack on the residents of the village of Borozdinovskaya in the Shelkovsky district of the Chechen Republic. Later, the authorities of the Chechen Republic officially admitted that soldiers of the \"Vostok\" battalion of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which was at that time commanded by Hero of Russian Federation Sulim Yamadayev, took part in the operation. In 2007, a complaint was filed with the ECHR on behalf of 96 residents of Borozdinovskaya, which was later combined with another application by fellow villagers. As a result, 126 Russian citizens born between 1930 and 2014 acted as applicants. They claimed that the military had illegally \"searched their homes, arrested them, subjected them to cruel treatment, and killed locals.\" In addition, according to the plaintiffs, four houses were set on fire, and 11 men were abducted. Finally, the plaintiffs claimed that discrimination based on their national origin (Avars) took place. They alleged that the Russian authorities did not conduct an effective investigation of what had happened. 97 applicants were represented by lawyers Olga Sadovskaya and R. Rajabov from the Committee Against Torture (CAT). The ECHR ruled that the following articles of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated: Article 2 (right to life), Article 3 (prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment), Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life), Article 13 (right to an effective remedy), Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination), and also Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property). In addition, the ECHR found that Russia had violated Article 38 (procedure for considering the case). The total compensation amount to the victims was 1,842,000 euros.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nIn 2017, Olga Sadovskaya, who was representing the Committee against Torture, was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Freedom Prize by the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for outstanding efforts in combatting torture in Russia.\nIn 2018, Olga Sadovskaya, along with journalist Elena Milashina from Novaya Gazeta and Svetlana Gannushkina, founder of the Memorial Human Rights Center, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. They were nominated by Norwegian Socialist Left Party parliamentarian Petter Eide. Ludmila Alexeyeva, the chair of the Moscow Helsinki Group, was also on the list. \nIn 2023, Olga Sadovskaya received an award from the Moscow Helsinki Group for her contributions to the defense of the rights of prisoners and other vulnerable groups.\n\n\n== Pressure and Threats ==\nOn June 6, 2011, Olga Sadovskaya received notification that all of her credit cards had been blocked due to suspicious withdrawals. On June 8, she was invited to the prosecutor's office of the Nizhny Novgorod district for a conversation with the senior assistant prosecutor regarding the Civil Forum EU-Russia, of which she was a member of the Coordination Council. On the same day, unknown individuals removed the license plates from her car. Sadovskaya regarded these events as local excesses in anticipation of the EU-Russia Summit, which opened in Nizhny Novgorod on June 9, 2011. In parallel with the official summit, the Coordination Council of the Civil Forum EU-Russia had planned to hold a press conference in which Olga Sadovskaya was supposed to participate. The event was scheduled for June 9 at the Rosbalt agency's office in Nizhny Novgorod, but the agency refused to host it the day before.\nOn June 21, 2011, prior to Olga Sadovskaya's trip to Strasbourg, all the fences near her house were painted with texts containing insults and threats directed at her. \nOn April 28, 2023, in Nizhny Novgorod, police officers conducted early morning searches in the offices of the human rights organization \"Crew against Torture,\" which Olga Sadovskaya is associated with. These searches were related to a criminal case initiated against the \"Crew against Torture\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Zeppelin-Staaken L was an experimental long-range maritime patrol floatplane developed during World War I by Zeppelin-Staaken for the Imperial German Navy's (Kaiserliche Marine) Naval Air Service (Marine-Fliegerabteilung). Derived from the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI heavy bomber, it was a large, four-engine aircraft with its engines grouped in tractor-pusher pairs between the wings. A single aircraft was ordered for evaluation purposes in 1917. Six improved versions were ordered while the L was being tested. It was destroyed in a crash in June 1918 with the death of everyone aboard.\n\n\n== Background and description ==\nBy late 1916, the vulnerability of the Zeppelins on reconnaissance missions over the North Sea had been recognized by the Naval Air Service and Rear Admiral (Konteradmiral) Philipp, commander of the Naval Air Service, outlined requirements for three types of multi-engine seaplanes to replace the Zeppelins. The highest priority was for a four-engine maritime patrol aircraft with an endurance of 10‚Äì12 hours, capable of maintaining altitude on two engines, in a memorandum on 26 December. Philipp clarified that the reconnaissance aircraft's task would be mine spotting, anti-submarine duties, and shipping control on 10 February 1917. In response, Zeppelin-Staaken offered a floatplane version of their R.VI heavy bomber modified with additional fuel tanks and the Naval Air Service placed an order for a single aircraft on 15 February.\nThe fuselage of the L was a lattice girder built from wood and steel tubing with the forward portion covered by plywood and the rest by fabric. The crew compartment housed both pilots, the bombardier/navigator, the wireless operator and the fuel attendant. In the nose of the fuselage was the bombardardier's position and the bombsight; it could be fitted with a machine gun. Behind the crew compartment was the dorsal gunner's position armed with two flexible machine gun mounts and the ventral gunner's position with a single gun. The L was built with the R.VI's conventional landing gear with a twin-wheel auxiliary undercarriage beneath the nose for use during landing, but these were replaced once the aircraft had flown to the testing site in Potsdam with two large duralumin floats. Each float was subdivided into a dozen watertight compartments.\nThe L was a four-bay biplane with the fuselage attached to the lower wing. The wooden wings had two main spars and were built in three parts, a center portion and two end panels that were bolted to the center section. Balanced ailerons were only located on the upper wing. Unlike the R.VI they extended past the wingtips and the wings were slightly swept back at an angle of 1.5 degrees. The L was fitted with a biplane empennage with two horizontal stabilizers and two balanced rudders. Initially the upper horizontal stabilizer was only connected to the fuselage by struts, but a vertical stabilizer with an additional rudder was added during flight testing to improve directional stability. Elevators extended across the full width of both horizontal stabilizers.\nThe 260-horsepower (190 kW) Mercedes D.IVa straight-six engines were located between the wings on A-shaped struts positioned above the floats. Each pair of engines were housed in an aluminium nacelle that rested on the crossbar of each strut with an engine at the front and the other at the rear. Additional struts ran from the lower wings to the nacelles to support the weight of the gearboxes. The radiators for each engine were attached to the strut above the nacelle. A flight mechanic's cockpit was positioned between the engines in the nacelle. Four-bladed propellers were initially fitted to the rear engines, but these were replaced by two-bladed ones during flight testing. The L was fitted with fourteen 245-litre (54 imp gal; 65 US gal) fuel tanks in the central fuselage. In addition each nacelle contained two 150-litre (33 imp gal; 40 US gal) fuel tanks. A 155-litre (34 imp gal; 41 US gal) gravity tank was positioned under the upper wing above each nacelle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Zeppelin-Staaken L was completed in August 1917 and had its floats installed before 5 September when it made two short flights from the Spree River. Taxiing trials revealed a need to reinforce the floats with additional struts. The aircraft attempted to fly to the Naval Air Service base at Warnem√ºnde on 12 November, but one engine failed and it had to make an emergency landing at Saaler Bodden, 40 km (25 mi) from the base. Repairs took a couple of days and the L was turned over to the Seaplane Experimental Command (Seeflugzeug-Versuchs-Kommando) on 17 November for testing. The aircraft was too large to fit in any of the existing hangars and a special hangar had to be built for it.\nFlight testing showed that once enough fuel had been consumed to allow the L to fly on three engines, its range could be extended by turning one engine off. The only other result known from the testing is that it was not as stable on the water as the Zeppelin-Lindau flying boats like the RS.III designed by Claude Dornier. The Naval Air Service ordered six improved versions as the Zeppelin-Staaken 8301 in two batches in December 1917 and January 1918. The L crashed at Warnem√ºnde on 3 June 1918, killing all aboard, possibly due to engine failure.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nData from The German Giants: The German R-Planes 1914 ‚Äì 1918General characteristics\nCrew: 7\nLength: 22.2 m (72 ft 10 in)\nWingspan: 42.2 m (138 ft 5 in)\nHeight: 7.38 m (24 ft 3 in)\nWing area: 360 m2 (3,900 sq ft)\nEmpty weight: 8,400 kg (18,519 lb)\nGross weight: 11,800 kg (26,015 lb)\nFuel capacity: 3,395 L (747 imp gal; 897 US gal)\nPowerplant: 4 √ó Mercedes D.IVa water-cooled straight-six engines, 190 kW (260 hp)  each\nPropellers: 2-bladed, 4.4 m (14 ft 5 in) diameter\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 125 km/h (78 mph, 67 kn)\nEndurance: 10 hours\nService ceiling: 2,500 m (8,200 ft)\nTime to altitude: 23.7 minutes to 1,000 m (3,300 ft)\nArmament\n\nGuns: Provision for nose, dorsal and ventral machine guns\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGray, Peter & Thetford, Owen (1987) [1970].

        "content": "The Meuse campaign was a major operation during the Dutch Revolt lead by the Prince of Orange in which he took the cities of Venlo, Roermond, Sittard and Maastricht.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1572, 6 years after the revolt broke out, the Geuzen who backed the Prince of Orange, captured a lot of cities in the Netherlands. Including the cities which were key locations for this campaign. The aftermath of this being that the Union of Utrecht was proclaimed in 1579.\n\nShortly after, Philip II sent the Duke of Parma to the Netherlands as governor and reconquered large parts of the Netherlands previously occupied and captured by the Rebels, including the cities that were captured during the campaign, the most notable one being Parma's siege of Maastricht.\nShortly after, in 1588. Maurice, Frederick's half-brother. Became the Prince of Orange and after his military reforms, conquered large parts of the territories previously captured by Parma, except  for the cities that would be captured  during this campaign.\n\nIn 1629, a few years before the initial campaign, Frederick Henry besieged and captured 's-Hertogenbosch, this would be known as his greatest achievement. The city of 's-Hertogenbosch was the last city that was in Spanish hands before Frederick could initiate his campaign. So the capture of 's-Hertogenbosch allowed Frederick Henry to launch his campaign.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\n\n\n=== Siege of Venlo ===\nThe Siege of Venlo was the first major action of the campaign. This siege lasted from the 1st of June until the 4th of June when the garrison in Venlo was forced to capitulate.\n\n\n=== Siege of Roermond ===\n\nThe Siege of Roermond occurred on the 2nd of June until the 5th of June when a Dutch force of 20000 men took on a Spanish garrison of around 300 men and forced the garrison to capitulate. Even though the Dutch Army successfully took the city of Roermond, the Dutch still suffered a heavy loss due to the death of Ernest Casimir when he got shot when inspecting a nearby trench.\n\n\n=== Siege of Maastricht ===\n\nThe siege of Maastricht was the last and most major military action during the campaign. The siege itself lasted from the 9th of June until the 22nd of August, the siege was fought between the Dutch States Army lead by Frederick and Horace Vere and the combined forces of the Spanish and Imperial armies. After the outnumbered Dutch forces successfully besieged the city, the city was left in Dutch hands.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nEven though the campaign was a success for the Dutch, the cities of Roermond and Venlo would be recaptured by Spanish forces. Spanish forces would also try to recapture Maastricht, but without success.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRoberts, Andrew (2020).

        "content": "Lepiderema sericolignis, commonly known as silkwood, is a plant in the maple and lychee family Sapindaceae found only in the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLepiderema sericolignis is a small tree to about 4 m (13 ft) high. The compound leaves have 2, 3, or rarely 4 pairs of leaflets that are glossy green above and dull green below. The leaflets are held on very short pulvinate stems about 5 mm (0.20 in) long. They measure up to 16 cm (6.3 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide and are elliptic in outline, with between 7 and 12 pairs of lateral veins in the blades.\nThe inflorescences are short spikes about 4.5 cm (1.8 in) long, produced in small clusters on old wood and in the leaf axils. Flowers are either male or female, white to creamy yellow, with 5 petals and measuring about 5 mm (0.20 in) wide. The fruit is a globose, apricot/orange capsule up to 2 cm (0.79 in) long and wide, with three segments each containing a single black seed almost fully enclosed in a yellow aril. The capsules persist on the branches after ripening and dry dark brown or black.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering occurs between March and May, and fruit are ripe from August to December.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described in 1892 as Cupania sericolignis by the Australian botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. In 1924, the Bavarian botanist Ludwig Adolph Timotheus Radlkofer transferred it to the current genus Lepiderema.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe genus name Lepidorema is from the Ancient Greek words lep√≠s meaning a scale or flake, and er√™mos meaning \"bereft of\" or without. It refers to the scale-less petals. The species epithet sericolignis is derived from the Ancient Greek sƒìrik√≥s meaning silky, and the Latin lignis meaning wood, and is a reference to the sheen of the timber.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nLepiderema sericolignis inhabits rainforest, often close to rivers or mangrove communities, from around Rossville southwards to about Ingham. The altitudinal range is from sea level to about 1,000 m (3,300 ft).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed as least concern under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act. As of 23 April 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

        "content": "Dorothea Deakin (1876‚Äì1924) was an English writer of short stories, plays, and village life novels.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was the daughter of Saretta, the sister of children's writer E. Nesbit. After Saretta's death in 1899, Nesbit 'treated Dorothea like a third daughter,' taking her on holiday with the family, and is cited as an inspiration for Dorothea's beginning to write at the age of sixteen.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nShe and Nesbit wrote two one-act plays together, The King‚Äôs Highway and The Philandrist, or the London Fortune Teller, which were performed in 1905. Dorothea's short story The Wishing Ring was also the basis of a play by Owen Davis.\nIn 1906, Dorothea's book 'Georgie' was taken on by Nesbit's agent at her request.\nGeorgie was called by a contemporary reviewer 'Just a jolly book for an idle hour.' Deakin's books have been described unfavourably as 'fairly tedious comedies of village or country house life... The standard Deakin figure is the heroine of boyish charm whose lover calls her a \"good sport\" and whose mission in life is to upset the rector's wife.'\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1910 she married R.W. Reynolds, the schoolmaster of J.R.R. Tolkien. They had three daughters. In 1922 the pair moved to Capri, hoping for an improvement in Dorothea's tuberculosis. She died in 1924.\n\n\n== Select works ==\nThe Smile of Melinda (1903)\nThe Poet and the Pierrot (1905)\n'Georgie' (1906)\nTormentilla (1908)\nThe Young Columbine (1908)\nThe Goddess Girl (1910)\n\n\n== References ==",

The elections were held for the role of Mayor of Porirua plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors, also elected triennially. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to the election there was a minor controversy on the council. In early 1980 Porirua's Town Clerk, Gordon Gandell, retired. The former deputy mayor of neighbouring Lower Hutt, John Seddon, was employed for the role. Allegations ensued that his appointment had been a \"jack up\" by the Labour majority on the city council and his friendship with deputy mayor John Burke. A group of senior Porirua City Council officers jointly signed a letter during the appointment row saying he wasn't the right man for the job. Seddon was not an accountant, the usual prior professional qualification of town clerks at that time, but he had been responsible for managing a company with three times the asset turnover of the Porirua City Council. Ombudsman Lester Castle was called in and eventually cleared the appointment process as being sufficiently objective. Labour lost their council majority at the election which was attributed to the employment controversy. Several Labour councillors were dumped from the party ticket prior to the election. One, Ivan Hardgrave, stood instead as an independent candidate and was successful.\nThe election also saw the introduction of a new party to contest control of the council with the emergence of the Rates Reform ticket. Founded in early 1979, the Rates Reform group accused local bodies of excessive spending and wanted a cessation to rates increases funded by cutting services and council staff.\n\n\n== Mayoral results ==\n\n\n== Councillor results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Heinrich von Hayek after 1919 as Heinrich Hayek (29 October 1900 ‚Äì 28 September 1969) was an Austrian anatomist and comparative zoologist. He been a member of the NSDAP from 1938 (member number 5518677) and was involved in anatomical studies many made on the bodies of victims executed by the Third Reich. A major and influential work resulting from this was a book on the human lung Die Menschliche Lunge (1953).\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nVon Hayek was born in Vienna, son of physician and professor of botany August von Hayek (1871‚Äì1928). His grandfather Gustav von Hayek was a zoologist and his younger brother Erich Gustav became a professor of chemistry while his older brother Friedrich August became a Nobel prize winner in economics in 1973. The family had been given a noble title which was taken away in Austria in 1919. Von Hayek was educated at Vienna where he received a medical degree in 1924. He did not get drafted into World War I as he was considered to be of poor physique. He worked as an assistant to Ferdinand Hochstetter at the University of Vienna while also studying zoology. He was also a colleague of In 1929 he earned a doctorate in zoology specializing in comparative anatomy. He then became a senior assistant at the University of Rostock under Curt Elze. During the Nazi years, he investigated methods to study arteries using freshy executed victims of the third reich. In 1935 Hayek was recruited as a professor of anatomy at the Tongji University in Shanghai which had an anatomy department traditionally headed by Germans. In 1937 the institute where he worked was destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War and Hayek fled into interior China. At the end of year he received a position at the University of W√ºrzburg but he was able to leave China only in 1938. He worked on various anatomical topics including physical anthropology research with studies of Chinese frontal lobes. Hayek taught at W√ºrzburg and served as an interim director in 1939-40 when Hans Petersen (1885‚Äì1946) was away. In 1945, the city was bombed and the university was largely destroyed. In August 1945 the allied forces dismissed him from his position based on his membership in the NSDAP. He had also been a member of the NS Volkswohlfahrt and NS teachers' associations. He served as a St√ºtzpunktleiter (local manager) for the Reichs-dozentenschaft (teachers union).\nHayek published 17 papers between 1938 and 1945 and he noted in a 1940 manuscript that his studies of the interlobar septa of the lungs was best carried out on the lungs of young executed persons of which he had made available. Nine of the 17 studies noted that the bodies studied were of execution victims. The University of W√ºrzburg received 910 bodies of which 120 came from well-known execution sites. The anatomical institute received 80 bodies killed by carbon monoxide at a psychiatric institution under a program of euthanasia headed by Werner Heyde. According to the questionnaire that Hayek had to fill during denazification, Hayek had to take an oath of secrecy under a high-ranking SS officer regarding the origin of the bodies. Hayek made use of his network of connections to rehabilitate himself after the war. He became a non-tenured professor at the University of W√ºrzburg in November 1947. In 1952 he moved to Vienna where he became a professor working until his death. He also held the chair of histology and embryology in 1957 and served as dean of medicine in 1960‚Äì61.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of Vienna biography\nThe human lung (1960, English translation)",

        "content": "The 2024 Fox Hill Supercross race crash was a fatal motorsport race crash that occurred on 21 April 2024 at the Fox Hill racing track in Diyatalawa, Uva Province, Sri Lanka. Seven spectators died and around 21 people were admitted to the hospital after sustaining critical injuries. The crash was caused when two racing cars apparently lost control and collided with a group of spectators during the 17th race of the 1500cc Ford Laser Mazda 323 category.\nThe motorsport event was organised by the Sri Lanka Military Academy in collaboration with Sri Lanka Automobile Sports and the Sri Lanka Army Motor Sports Committee. The event featured a grand total of 24 racing events, including 12 motorcycle and motorcar events each. The organizers had opened up the event to spectators for free of charge and it was estimated that around 100,000 people were present to watch the motorsport event.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Fox Hill Supercross is an annual racing event hosted by the Sri Lanka Military Academy intending to raise funds to manifest and elevate the infrastructure and training facilities of the military academy. The Fox Hill Supercross was first hosted in 1993 and has since become the most sought-after motorsport event in Sri Lanka. The motorsport event is held annually on a two-kilometre gravel track that is built amidst mountainous terrain within the Military Academy shooting range in Diyathalawa.\nIn 2024, the Fox Hill Supercross race made its comeback after a five-year hiatus, as it was last held in 2019. The Fox Hill Supercross race was cancelled for the past few years due to restrictions imposed by authorities owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and later due to concerns related to the Sri Lankan economic crisis. The 2024 edition was the 28th edition of the Fox Hill Supercross race, and the racing event garnered around 270 entries, including 150 cars and 120 bikes. This also marked the first instance in Fox Hill Supercross history that a single edition had received 150 car entries, as the event history suggests, otherwise often generating 120 car entries in general in the race's history.\n\n\n== Crash ==\nThe crash happened during the course of the motorsport event when two racing cars collided with a group of spectators leaving seven people dead. Four officials of the racing event who were stationed as flag marshals were also among the casualties. The crash also killed an eight-year old child who was one of the spectators during the event. Five people reportedly died at the crash site, and two people who sustained severe injuries later succumbed to death at the hospital. According to Police spokesperson Nihal Talduwa, he told BBC Sinhala that the accident occurred when the car jumped out of the running lane. The organisers eventually decided to temporarily suspend the remaining racing events following the fatal crash.\nOfficials attempted to slow cars down around the scene by waving yellow lights, but as the cars sped past, one red car veered off course and crashed into spectators on the side of the unguarded track. Eyewitness claimed that during one of the car races in the afternoon session (Sri Lankan local time), a vehicle bearing the number '71' overturned, prompting race marshals to signal a caution with yellow flags. Unexpectedly, amidst this commotion, another car veered off the track, careening into a group of spectators. Initially, reports speculated that the cars that collided with spectators were numbered '5' and '196', but authorities have yet to officially confirm these details.\nVideo footage of the disaster went viral on social media as they captured the visibly shaken drivers receiving medical attention from paramedics. The injured people were admitted at both Diyatalawa Base Hospital and Badulla General Hospital for treatment.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nTwo racing drivers who participated in the racing event were arrested by the police for the incident, and both were remanded to 30 April by the Bandarawela Magistrate's Court. The drivers were arrested on charges of dangerous driving and were produced on court on 22 April.\nThe Sri Lanka Army made a decision to appoint a special investigation committee consisting of 7 senior officers chaired by a Major General in order to conduct inquiries and probe over the fatal crash which took place. The Sri Lanka Police also launched investigations by recording key statements from the organisers of the event, and it was revealed that the dust on the racing track was not appropriately dampened, which may have led to the fatal crash.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a colorless crystalline substance stable in its solid state around -20 ¬∞C.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe molecule possesses approximately C2 symmetry and the mesityl groups are twisted by 54.2¬∞. The bulky mesityl groups cause steric strain which is reduced by increase in  R1‚ÄìC‚ÄìR2 angle from 117¬∞ in doixirane to 119.2¬∞ in dimesityldioxirane. The mesityl groups also rotate about the single bond, consequently reducing steric repulsions further.\n\n\n== Synthesis and Uses ==\nDimesityldioxirane was first isolated at room temperature in  pure as well as in solution form in 1994. It was synthesised by irradiation of its diazo derivative in trichlorofluoromethane at 183K to form dimesitylcarbene, followed by oxidation. The synthesis had a yield of 50%.\nIt can mainly be used as an oxidizing agent but is less oxidizing than other dioxiranes due to its stability.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDifluorodioxirane\nDimethyldioxirane\nShi epoxidation\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Justin Cheung Kin Sing (Chinese: ÂºµÂª∫ËÅ≤; born 11 March 1983) is a Hong Kong actor. Starting his career in HMV-produced erotic films, Cheung gained recognition with his lead role as Frankie in the erotic black comedy film Due West: Our Sex Journey (2012). He then transitioned to different genres, starring in the crime film Imprisoned (2015) and the drama film The Menu (2016). Cheung achieved breakout success with the role Jiu Jik in the crime thriller series OCTB (2017). He continued to star in various productions, taking on lead roles in crime films Deception of the Novelist (2019) and the Breakout Brothers trilogy (2021‚Äì2022), as well as supporting lead roles in ViuTV action thriller series Warriors Within (2020) and action film Dynasty Warriors (2021). He is set to reprise as Jiu Jik in the upcoming OCTB 2.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCheung was born on March 11, 1983, in Hong Kong. Cheung's father works as a cross-border truck driver, and he grew up in a public housing estate. He attended S.K.H. Leung Kwai Yee Secondary School, but he did not perform well academically, and he described himself as deviant during his youth. At the age of 16, he started working as a janitor at a hotel in Central prior to graduation and only scored one mark in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. After completing secondary school, he worked in various roles such as a clerk, delivery man, salesman, and construction worker. When he turned 18, he developed an interest in artistic cycling and began filming his moves, which sparked his fascination with filmmaking. At the age of 25, Cheung went on a nine-month working holiday to Perth, Australia. During his time there, he worked on a farm, in a steel mill, and at a Chinese restaurant. He also entered into a relationship with a Chinese girlfriend and nearly got married, but ultimately ran away from the wedding and returned to Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon his return to Hong Kong, he did not find any job until his newfound girlfriend encouraged him to pursue a career in modeling. After two years as a model, Cheung aspired to become an actor and signed with Stephen Shiu Jr.'s artist agency, HMV Digital China. In the first year, he didn't receive any job offers except for one as a podcast host. However, he began receiving roles in erotic films in the following year. Cheung's breakout role came in 2012 when he landed the leading role of Frankie in the erotic film Due West: Our Sex Journey, which was adapted from the web novel Dongguan Wood. During the filming of Due West, director Mark Wu recommended that he try method acting, which became his acting style and ignited his passion for the craft. However, his fame also led to him being labeled as an erotic star, which resulted in him being rejected for several film roles due to the stereotype. As a result, he decided to switch genres and starred in another leading role in the 2013 romance film The Best Plan Is No Plan, alongside Sammy Sum and Hanjin Tan. In 2015, Cheung starred as Jack, the main villain and co-leading role, in the crime film Imprisoned: Survival Guide for Rich and Prodigal alongside Gregory Wong. He gained sixty pounds for the role, and took acting courses at a community centre to improve his skills. He also had a minor role in the comedy film Love Detective in the same year and landed another leading role as Chong Nga Yuen, a media tycoon, in the drama film The Menu the following year.\nCheung achieved breakthrough success with his portrayal of Jiu Jik, a maniac gangster, in the crime thriller web series OCTB. He immersed himself in the character through method acting, dying his hair and eyebrows white, and spending two months with real gangsters. He also drew inspiration from Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker, considering his performance a tribute to the character. The show's popularity and Cheung's multi-layered and convincing performance earned him widespread acclaim, and he won Most Popular Character in a Web Series in the Yahoo! Asia Buzz Awards 2017. Ming Pao described his performance as \"resounding\" and lauded his acting skills, while Yahoo! News recognized his character as \"the most eye-catching among characters of all kind in the series\". Oriental Daily News reported that Jiu Jik had attracted numerous fans, with some even getting tattoos of his portrait. Following this breakthrough, Cheung began receiving more roles in various productions, including a lead role in the 2017 horror film Ghost Net, and supporting roles in the 2018 crime film Project Gutenberg, the 2018 business-themed mystery series The Trading Floor, and the 2019 crime film P Storm.\nIn 2019, Cheung made his producer debut and starred as Chui Chit, the male protagonist, in the mystery film Deception of the Novelist. The following year, he took on lead roles as Lau Ka Wah and Tanaka Kunizen in the ViuTV drama series Sorina Fok and the action series Warriors Within. He also played the lead role of Scar in the Breakout Brother trilogy from 2021 to 2022, and had supporting roles as Sung Ngo Yeung in the sports film One Second Champion, Zhang Fei in the action film Dynasty Warriors, and Tsang Chi Wai in the crime film The Attorney. Cheung established a toy brand called NiL and in 2022, he launched an NFT featuring a cartoon version of Jiu Jik. In 2023, Cheung appeared in lead roles in the horror film Shadows and the crime film Death Notice. He is set to reprise his role as Jiu Jik in the currently in-production sequel OCTB 2. Cheung dedicated about a year to undergo method acting and reconnect with Jiu Jik's personality and mindset before the start of filming in 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCheung dated actress Kelly Chen for three years, before the broke up in July 2019. Cheung announced his relationship with actress Angel Zeng on December 25, 2023. They had been dating for a year and a half after meeting each other during the filming of the 2021 film P.T.G.F., in which Cheung played the role of Zeng's father.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJustin Cheung at IMDb",

On the first day four jet fighters dropped bombs on insurgents in the morning and evening. Eight soldiers were reportedly killed and two insurgents injured. On the second day at least five Myanmar soldiers were reportedly killed with junta MI-35 attacking insurgent forces for 20 minutes. On 17 November, MEDF forces dropped bombs on the outpost reportedly killing six soldiers and wounding many, with one insurgent being injured. On 18 November four soldiers were reportedly killed and one CNDF fighter injured. On 19 November junta forces installed drone jamming device preventing insurgents from conducting further attacks. On 20 November, the Chin insurgents claimed to have killed at least five soldiers after ambushing them in the Bualte village at around 5pm. In retaliation soldiers burned down people's homes in the village.\nChin forces claimd that out of 34 soldiers at the outpost, 25 were killed, and many other injured. Four drones were lost during the attack but Chin forces were unable the seize the outpost due to airstrikes.\nAt night of 14 November 2023 Chin forces stormed the camp again. At 5am 15 November they managed to overrun it, setting it ablaze and capturing substantial quality of weapons and ammunition. 29 soldiers stationed there fled to India. They were repatriated back to Myanmar a few days later.\n\n\n== References ==",

Pierre Dietsch, an Alsatian polytechnician, built this collection over thirty years during his travels in Europe; he died in 1999 (on 17 February), shortly after depositing his games with the town of Rambouillet. This deposit led to the opening of the Goose Game Museum on 6. 80 goose games, both French and foreign were permanently displayed until the museum's closure in 2011. The collection, purchased in 2008, remains in the possession of the city hall.\nThe museum was located in a restored wing of the Palais du Roi de Rome, in the center of Rambouillet.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Related articles ===\nGoose game\nRambouillet\n\n\n=== External links ===\nRambouillet City Hall, The Goose Games (Pierre Dietsch Collection), former collection of the Goose Game Museum",

His main focus was the author Ernest Hemingway and his magnum opus was an extensive, five-volume biography:\n\nThe Young Hemingway (Blackwell, 1986),\nHemingway: The Paris Years (Blackwell, 1989)\nHemingway: The American Homecoming (Blackwell, 1992)\nHemingway: The 1930s (Norton, 1997)\nHemingway: The Final Years (Norton, 1999)\nReynolds studied Hemingway in a meticulous way, cataloguing the details of his life.  His doctoral thesis at Duke University became his first book, Hemingway‚Äôs First War.  This showed that Hemingway likewise did not just write from personal experience, as commonly supposed, but also did detailed research for his writing.\nReynolds was the son of a geologist in Kansas City, Missouri.  He married Ann Eubanks in 1960 and they had two daughters.  His death at age 63 in Santa Fe, New Mexico was caused by pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Velodroom Zurenborg was a cycling track in the Zurenborg area in Antwerp, Belgium. The facility existed from 1894 to 1910 and the length of the cycling track was 400 m. It hosted the world track cycling championships in 1894 and 1905.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1894, the World Exposition was being organized in Antwerp, which also included a cycling congress and competition. This was the impetus for the creation of a new velodrome in the city. On 18 January 1894, the public limited company Soci√©t√© Anonyme V√©lodrome d'Anvers was founded and succeeded in getting the cycling track built. The facility was officially opened in May 1894. It was built on the Zurenborg estate, on land leased from a local company building housing in the area. The arena was equipped with a 400-metre cycling track and two covered grandstands, in addition to which there were also several thousand uncovered standing places.\nIn August 1894, the track hosted the second edition of the world amateur track cycling championships, organized as part of the ongoing World Exposition in the city. The construction of the track proved to be a successful idea and it was frequently used, not only for cycling competitions, but also for other sporting events. The construction company was particularly pleased with the new arena, for which the facility was an excellent advertisement for the area. \nIn the following years of the circuit's operation, the main cycling event held at the velodrome was the Grand Prix d'Anvers, organized on the occasion of the town fete. In return for giving the public free entry, the organizers of the competition received subsidies from the city to run it. Also different national track cycling championships were organized in the velodrome.\nThe very first game of the Belgian national football competition (Antwerp F.C.-Sporting Club Bruxelles) was played on an area next to the track on November 10th, 1895. Between 1897 and 1903, Antwerp F.C. played their matches on the pitch inside the track. In winter, an ice rink was organized here. \nIn July 1905, the world track cycling championships were held on the track for the second time.\nIn the Belle √âpoque, 'Zurenborg' was pronounced in one go with world-renowned cycling arenas like Parc des Princes in Paris and Madison Square Garden in New York. All the greats of pre-war cycling history were active there: the French great Edmond Jacquelin, the African-American sensation Major Taylor, and numerous other sprint legends who have fallen into oblivion along with the golden age of velodromes.\nOn 1 October 1905, the contract for the lease of the grounds expired. It was henceforth renewed for shorter periods, but it became clear that in the near future a construction company would want to build more residential buildings on the site. As early as 1905, the position of the entrance gate was changed, bringing it closer to the velodrome to make room for the construction of new flats. The building was finally closed and demolished in 1910. Housing was subsequently built in its place, and one of the streets that passes through the site of the former track is named \"Velodroomstraat\". \nIn 1911, a new cycling track was opened at Apollostraat, about a kilometer to the west. It was also called 'Zurenborg', although it was located on a different area. However, the facility was quickly decommissioned during the First World War.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGarden City Velodrome\nList of cycling tracks and velodromes\n\n\n== References ==",

This allows devirtualization, the removal of the use of vtables for method lookup, thus allowing the inlining of method calls on final classes.\nfinal is not a reserved word in C++, and is instead defined as a contextual keyword, in order to not conflict with uses of the identifier 'final' in existing codebases.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nfinal (Java)",

Its length is 124.3 km.\n\n\n== Route description ==\nThe road starts at Km 6.9 of the first class I-7 southeast of the city of Silistra and heads southeast through the region of Dobrudzha in the eastern Danubian Plain. It passes through the villages of Bogorovo and Sredishte and 4.4 km after the latter enters Dobrich Province. There the road runs through the villages of Kolartsi, Hitovo and Karapelit, turns east and reaches the northwestern outskirts of the city of Dobrich at Riltsi neighbourhood. As it bypasses the city from the southwest and the south it doubles for a few kilometers with the second class roads of II-27, II-29 and II-97. South of Dobrich the road heads in southern direction through Branishte, Stefanovo and Slaveevo, and at the village of Batovo descends to the deep valley of the river Batova. Following the river valley, the II-71 runs through the village of Tsarkva and reaches its terminus at Km 6.9 of the first class I-9 at the eastern outskirts of the village of Obrochishte on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"List of the Republican Roads in the Republic of Bulgaria\" (PDF) (in Bulgarian).

They drew on earlier traditions including the chivalric romances of medieval and early modern times, the medieval mystery plays, and plays such as Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest. They were notable for their stage effects.\nIn Vienna, they were among the plays performed in the Theater in der Leopoldstadt, the Theater auf der Wieden, the Theater an der Wien and the Theater in der Josefstadt.\nAn early such work was Meg√§ra, die f√∂rchterliche Hexe (\"Meg√§ra, the witch of the forest\") by Philipp Hafner, of 1763. In the 19th century Zauberspiele were written by dramatists including Ferdinand Raimund, Adolf B√§uerle, Josef Alois Gleich, Karl Meisl, Johann Nestroy and Franz Xaver Told, whose play Der Zauberschleier (\"The Magic Veil\"), of 1842, was particularly successful.\n\n\n== See also ==\nF√©erie (\"fairy play\"), a French theatrical genre\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\n==== Background ====\nThe Mata vs. Avianca case, emerging from a legal dispute in New York, dispute in New York, not only sheds light on the complexities of AI implementation in the legal profession but also underscores the critical importance of ethics and accountability in AI-driven decision-making processes.The case revolves around allegations of misconduct by the plaintiff's attorneys, who utilized an AI program for legal research. The AI tool, in an alarming turn of events, generated fictitious cases and fabricated legal citations, including nonexistent case law. This error led to severe repercussions, with the New York federal judge sanctioning the attorneys for their negligent conduct. A n attorney should understand the risks and benefits of the technology used in connection with providing legal services. How these obligations apply will depend on a host of factors, including the client, the matter, the practice area, the firm size, and the tools themselves, ranging from free and readily available to custom-built, proprietary formats.\n\nDisclosure and Accountability \nAn attorney should consider disclosure to their client that they intend to use generative AI in the representation, including how the technology will be used, and the benefits and risks of such use.\nIn Pennsylvania, the court issued a standing Order that required each counsel (or a party representing himself or herself) to disclose whether he or she has used generative Artificial Intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù) in the preparation of any complaint, answer, motion, brief, or other paper filed with the Court, including in correspondence with the Court. The court directed that the counsel must in a clear and plain factual statement, disclose that generative AI has been used in any way in the preparation of the filing or correspondence and certify that each and every citation to the law or the record in the filing has been verified as authentic and accurate.In Ohio, a state court prohibited attorneys from using Artificial Intelligence in preparation of any filing to be submitted in Court.\nThe Mata case highlights the issue of accountability in AI utilization. When confronted with the discovery of the fabricated content, the attorneys' response was characterized by delay and evasion, exacerbating the gravity of their misconduct. The judge's decision to sanction the attorneys underscores the principle that legal professionals must be held accountable for their actions particularly where Artificial Intelligence is involved. Just as a lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that a law firm has policies to reasonably assure that the conduct of a nonlawyer assistant is compatible with the lawyer's own professional obligations, a lawyer must do the same for generative AI. Lawyers who rely on generative AI for research, drafting, communication, and client intake risk many of the same perils as those who have relied on inexperienced or overconfident nonlawyer assistants.\n\n\n===== Cofidentiality =====",

        "content": "Eddy and the Soul Band was a Dutch-based musical ensemble who were active during the 1980s. Led by Eddy Conard they had hits with their versions of   Soul Cha Cha\", and \"Theme from Shaft\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nBand leader Eddy Conard is from Gary, Indiana. Growing up he was obsessed with Isaac Hayes' hit song \"Theme from Shaft\". It was apparently the first record he purchased. Moving to Holland he studied sociology and he became a resident there. A percussionist from the age of twenty he played in bands who supported acts such as The Supremes, The Stylistics, Natalie Cole and Crown Heights Affair. He had a big hit in Holland with his version of Van McCoy's \"Soul Cha Cha\". Apparently a remark by a Dutch disk jockey gave him the encouragement to record his version  of \"Theme from Shaft\".\nIn 1982, Conard had some success with the single, \"You Are Unique\". Credited to Eddy Conard & The American Dance Band, it charted for five weeks in the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Soulchacha aka Soul Cha Cha ===\nThe group covered Van McCoy's song, \"Soul Cha Cha\", but had the title as \"Soulchacha\". It was backed with \"In the Night\". Both sides were produced by Jacques Zwart. It was released in the Netherlands on Philips Philips 818 237-7. The single peaked at no. 24 in the Dutch charts during the first quarter of 1984. It was also a hit in Belgium, spending a total of three weeks in the chart there, peaking at no. 28.\n\n\n=== Theme from Shaft ===\nEddy and the Soulband recorded their version of the \"Theme from Shaft\" which was released in the UK in 12\" format on Beat Records 308467  (Hot Persuit Mix), and in 7\" format on Club JAB 11. \nOn the week of January 26, 1985, the 12\" Hot Persuit Mix version which was issued on Break 308467 made it's debut in at no. 50 in the Record Mirror Disco chart. On the week of February 23, 1985, the 7\" version of the record debuted in the UK singles chart at no. 30.  The Hot Persuit Mix also reached its peak position of no. 3 in the Disco chart that same week.\nOn the week of March 9, 1985,  the \"Hot Persuit Mix\" version of the song had dropped down from no. 4 to no. 5 in the Record Mirror RM Disco chart. At week three, the 7\" version of \"Shaft\" had moved up from 19 to 13. The single 7\" version would spend a total of seven weeks in the UK chart, peaking at no. 13. The week of April 6 was also the last week the 12\" version was in the Disco chart.\n\nThe single was also in the Record Mirror Night Club chart and was at no. 5 on the week of April 30.\nHis version of  \"Theme from Shaft\" came in at no. 61 in the Record Mirror Year End Disco chart for 1985.\n\n\n=== Further activities ===\nThe group recorded the single, \"The World Turns On (Peace Version)\" which was backed with \"The World Turns On (Dub Version)\". Produced by Jacques Zwart and Albert Boekholt, it was released in the UK on Club JABX 19 in 1985. It was also credited to Eddie C, and the Soulband. In the November 2 issue of Music Week, James Hamilton referred to it as an \"oddball Eurodisco instrumental medley of originally Norman Whitfield-produced Temptations/Edwin Starr oldies with unpredictable appeal\". \nIt was also in the Airplay Action Bubbling chart that week. It was still in the Bubbling chart on the week of November 9.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nConard was the featured vocalist on \" A Swingin' Safari\" by Afringo.

        "content": "Jos√© Sarto Nogueira Moreira (born 13 February 1959) is a physician and a Brazilian politician affiliated to the Democratic Labour Party (PDT). He has been the mayor of Fortaleza, the capital city of Cear√° since 2021.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJos√© Sarto was born in Acopiara, a municipality located in the center-south of the state of Cear√°, and is the son of Ant√¥nio Moreira de Oliveira and Maria Alice Nogueira de Oliveira. He moved at the age of one to Fortaleza, where he studied in a municipal public school. He studied and graduated in medicine at the Federal University of Cear√°, and worked as an intern in the areas of gynecology and obstetrics at Jackson Memorial Hospital, in Miami, Florida. Sarto also enrolled in the Master's course in political science at the Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences, owned by the University of Lisbon, in Portugal.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSarto began his political career by joining the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) in 1985. He entered the public life and ran for a seat of councillor in the Municipal Chamber of Fortaleza in the 1988 Fortaleza city election. He was elected with 2,604 votes. After his election as councillor of Fortaleza, he was elected president of the Municipal Chamber of Fortaleza from 1990 to 1992. Sarto left the Christian Democratic Party in 1992 and joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in the same year. He ran for a second term in 1992 and was re-elected with 3,462 votes.\n\n\n=== Legislative Assembly of Cear√° ===\nIn the 1994 Cear√° state election, Sarto ran for a seat at the Legislative Assembly of Cear√° and was elected for his first term as a state deputy with 29,301 votes. In the 1998 Cear√° state elections, he wasn't re-elected for a second term, only obtaining 29,669 votes and becoming the first alternate of his party. However, Sarto took office for a second term after the appointment of the state deputy Mauro Benevides Filho as a Secretary of Administration of the State of Cear√°. The same situation happened in the 2002 Cear√° state elections; Sarto only obtained 24,766 votes and became an alternate on his party. Sarto finally took office for a third term of state deputy after the appointment of the state deputy Francisco Aguiar for the Council of the Court of Auditors of the Municipalities of the State of Cear√°.\nAfter these two elections, he was re-elected for a fourth term in the 2006 Cear√° state elections with 58,013 votes; for a fifth term in the 2010 Cear√° state elections with 65,284 votes and for a sixth term in the 2014 Cear√° state elections with 85,310 votes (obtaining his best electoral result so far). He ran for a seventh term in the 2018 Cear√° state elections, obtaining 68,937 votes.\nDuring his terms in office as a state deputy, he was leader of the government of Cid Gomes and a deputy leader of the government of the former governor Camilo Santana. In the 2011/2012 biennium, Sarto was part of the Bureau of the Legislative Assembly and became the 1st Vice President of the house, serving as an Interim President in January 2013, after his predecessor Roberto Cl√°udio was elected as the mayor of Fortaleza in the 2012 Fortaleza mayoral election. On 1 February 2019, he was elected as the president of the Legislative Assembly of Cear√° with votes from 45 of the 46 state deputies for the 2019/2020 biennium.\n\n\n=== Mayor of Fortaleza (2021‚Äìpresent) ===\nOn 10 September 2020, the Democratic Labour Party of Cear√°, through virtual debates, nominated Sarto as a mayoral candidate in the 2020 Fortaleza mayoral election, in order to succeed the former mayor Roberto Cl√°udio, also a member of the party. √âlcio Batista, a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and the former chief of staff of the former governor Camilo Santana (PT), was chosen as his running mate in the ticket.\nThe convention that made his candidacy official took place two days later. The Democratic Labour Party, the Brazilian Socialist Party and ten other parties formed the Fortaleza Getting Better (Fortaleza Cada Vez Melhor) coalition. At the end of the first round of the election, on 15 November 2020, Sarto obtained 35.73% of the valid votes (equivalent to 457,622 voters) against 33.32% of the federal deputy Capit√£o Wagner (426,803 voters), with whom he contested the second round.\nOn 29 November 2020, after the second round of elections, Sarto obtained around 51.69% of the votes (668,652 voters) against Wagner's 48.31% (624,892 voters), being elected as the next mayor of Fortaleza.\n\n\n=== 2024 Fortaleza mayoral election ===\n\nAbout two years before the 2024 elections, Sarto stated that he could run for re-election as long as it was a Democratic Labour Party's decision. Throughout 2023, his candidacy for re-election was taken for granted by political figures of the party such as the former mayor Roberto Cl√°udio, the interim national president of the party Andr√© Figueiredo and the former governor of Cear√° Ciro Gomes.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarto was married for fourteen years to nurse Nat√°lia Herculano, divorcing her in 2021. They have one son.\n\n\n== References ==",

The tournament is the second global LAN tournament to be hosted by the game, and it served as one of the qualifying tournaments leading to its global crowning event of the season, the 2021 Valorant Champions. The tournament was held from September 10‚Äì19, 2021, in Berlin, Germany.\nGambit Esports won the championship after defeating Team Envy, via 3‚Äì0 sweep in the best-of-5 grand final to become the champions of the tournament and automatically qualify for the world championships.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe tournament served as one of the qualifying tournaments leading to the world championship with the winner earning an automatic qualification to the global event of the season. With this, it was set to accommodate 16 teams who qualified via the regional Challengers leagues globally, and one of them is Bren Esports who originally qualified for the tournament as the Southeast Asian Challengers Champions. However, due to visa issues and the national restrictions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team were forced to withdraw from the tournament and has left the tournament with 15 teams.\n\n\n== Qualification ==\n\n\n== Group Stage ==\nThe group stage was a GSL-style double elimination format, with only two teams per group qualified to the playoffs. All matches in the group stage were a best-of-three series.\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n=== Group C ===\n\n\n=== Group D ===\nAs a result of Bren Esports' withdrawal from the tournament, the format for this group has been changed from GSL-style double-elimination format to a double round-robin format.\n\n\n== Playoffs ==\nThe top two teams from each group qualified for the single-elimination crossover knockout stage. Teams are seeded in which the group winner will be paired against the second-seed of another group, which meant that teams from the same group can only meet until the Final.\n\n\n=== Quarterfinals ===\n\n\n=== Semifinals ===\n\n\n=== Grand Final ===\n\n\n== Final rankings ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Drones and Phantoms is a collection of poems by Jennifer Maiden, published by Giramondo Publishing in 2014.\nThe collection contains 31 poems, some of which are published here for the first time.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting in The Australian Book Review reviewer Toby Fitch noted: \"Her umbrella themes ‚Äì politics, power, evil, the public and private selves, war, and the role of art ‚Äì are back. The title is a beautiful droning of her past work ‚Äì 'But the problem of evil drums: rhythm / and the drug of immediacy' ‚Äì and has a brutal currency, given US drones are coming and going from Middle Eastern airspace, silently yet violently, like phantoms...One of Maiden's primary objectives is to confront the reader's conventional expectations of his or her own ethics...While uncomfortable, Maiden's mode is also a 'relaxed comic mode', as Martin Duwell once wrote, in which she ventriloquises living and dead historical figures and politicians, pairing them off in conversations so as to present opposing attitudes and anxieties. In this way Maiden can play devil's advocate and empathiser, and tease out the complexities and ethical ambiguities of world events in private, fanciful reckonings.\"\nIn the Cordite Poetry review David McCooey stated: \"Maiden's vigorous response to these poetic risks has been to programmatically, and often comically, confuse basic literary distinctions, especially those between poetry and journalism, realism and fantasy, and confession and fiction. The poems in Drones and Phantoms, as in her previous three collections with Giramondo Publishing, traverse all of these realms across classes of poems recognisable to readers of Maiden: 'Diary Poems', fantastic dialogues, and the discontinuous 'George Jeffreys' series...To write 'elegiac journalism' is to link the intimately personal with the impersonally public. Maiden‚Äôs project, it seems, is to insert intimacy into those distances (countries, detention centres, wars) to which the news draws attention, while denying intimacy with the human subjects to be found in those distant places. As Maiden‚Äôs poems show, those subjects also range across great social distances, from asylum seekers and the poor, to politicians and celebrities, and they share a strangely distant intimacy in the virtual space called the media.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nAfter the collection's initial publication by Giramondo Publishing in 2014 it has not been reprinted.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2015 ALS Gold Medal, winner\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nick Zachernuk (born September 17, 1997) is a Canadian curler from Halifax, Nova Scotia. He currently plays lead on Team Matthew Manuel. He is a two-time defending Nova Scotia Tankard champion and a four-time Nova Scotia junior champion.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nIn his junior career, Zachernuk won four straight Nova Scotia junior championships from 2015 to 2018 with skip Matthew Manuel. The duos first two titles came with teammates Ryan Abraham and Alec Cameron. At the 2015 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, the team lost in a tiebreaker 6‚Äì4 to Ontario's Mac Calwell, finishing tenth overall with a 4‚Äì5 record. The following year, they again finished in tenth at the 2016 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, this time with a 5‚Äì4 record. During their time together, the team also represented Nova Scotia at the 2015 Canada Winter Games. After a 4‚Äì1 round robin record, they lost in the quarterfinals 8‚Äì4 to Ontario's Matthew Hall.\nFollowing the 2015‚Äì16 season, Abraham left the team and was replaced by Adam Cocks. The team continued to dominate provincially, securing the 2017 and 2018 Nova Scotia junior titles. At the 2017 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, they just missed the playoffs with a 5‚Äì4 record, settling for fifth. In 2018, the team had their best showing with a 6‚Äì4 record, finishing sixth and just missing the tiebreakers. In their last year of juniors, Team Manuel lost in the final of the provincial championship to Graeme Weagle.\nIn university curling, Zachernuk played for the Dalhousie Tigers at three straight U Sports curling championships from 2016 to 2018. As lead on the team skipped by Robert Mayhew, the team got better at each appearance but never managed to reach the playoffs. They finished with a 2‚Äì5 record in 2016, 3‚Äì4 record in 2017 and 4‚Äì3 record in 2018.\n\n\n=== Men's ===\nAfter juniors, Zachernuk took two seasons off before coming back to Team Manuel for the 2021‚Äì22 season. With third Luke Saunders and second Jeffrey Meagher, Team Manuel qualified in two of their five events. After a quarterfinal finish at the Dave Jones Mayflower Cashspiel, the team made it to the final of the Superstore Monctonian Challenge where they lost to James Grattan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, the 2022 provincial championship was cancelled. The Nova Scotia Curling Association then decided to appoint Team Paul Flemming to represent Nova Scotia at the 2022 Tim Hortons Brier. The following season, the Manuel rink continued to build on their success from the previous year, reaching the final of the New Scotland Brewing Men's Cash Spiel and the semifinals of the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic and the Superstore Monctonian Challenge. At the 2023 Nova Scotia Tankard, the team lost their first game before rattling off seven straight victories to become both the B and C qualifiers. They then lost the first playoff game against Owen Purcell, forcing a sudden death final. Tied 4‚Äì4 in the tenth, Team Manuel stole a single point for the 5‚Äì4 victory and their first provincial men's title. This qualified the team of Manuel, Saunders, Meagher and Zachernuk for the 2023 Tim Hortons Brier where they finished with a 3‚Äì5 record, earning wins against the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan.\nThroughout the 2023‚Äì24 tour season, the Manuel rink only qualified in three of seven events and did not reach any finals. They had two semifinal finishes in Halifax and Moncton and a quarterfinal result at the Challenge de Curling Desjardins. Despite this, the team dominated at the 2024 Ocean Contractors Tankard, winning all five of their games. This included three victories against the Purcell rink who were ranked higher before the event began. This sent the team to the 2024 Montana's Brier in Regina, Saskatchewan. After struggling out of the gate with three consecutive losses, the team found their footing, rallying off wins against higher seeds Alberta's Aaron Sluchinski, Saskatchewan's Mike McEwen and Alberta's Kevin Koe. They then lost to Nunavut in their penultimate game, eliminating them from contention. They ended on a high note with a victory over Quebec to finish with an even 4‚Äì4 record.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nZachernuk is employed as an engineer at Lockheed Martin Canada. He is engaged.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Paul J. Zwier is a lawyer, author, and academic. He is a former Professor of Law, Director of the Advocacy Skills Program, and Director of the Program for International Advocacy and Dispute Resolution at Emory University, and has been serving as an Of Counsel at Guttman, Buschner & Brooks (GBB).\nZwier is most known for his work in advocacy, negotiation, and mediation skills training, with a focus on legal training for lawyers, torts law, evidence, and case studies regarding international affairs. He is the author of books including Principled Negotiation on an International Stage, Critical Race Theory and the American Justice System, and Effective Expert Testimony. He was awarded the Distinguished Educator award by the University of Richmond in 1991 and the Honorable Prentice Marshall Faculty Award by National Institute for Trial Advocacy (NITA) in 1998.\nZwier has conducted training sessions for judges and lawyers at international criminal courts such as the ICC, ICTY, ICTR, and ICT-Sierra Leone.\n\n\n== Education ==\nZwier completed his Bachelor of Arts degree at Calvin College in 1976, followed by a Juris Doctor degree at Pepperdine University School of Law in 1978, where he also contributed to the Pepperdine Law Review. Subsequently, he obtained his Master of Laws in Legal Education from Temple University School of Law in May 1981.\n\n\n== Career ==\nZwier has maintained bar admissions in California since 1979 and Virginia from 1984 to 1999. He has served as a speaker and panelist, delivering presentations on topics such as the rule of law, gender-based violence, and law and development at forums including the Law and Development Institute.\nZwier began his professional journey with NITA in 1982 as a Team Leader. Over the years, he assumed various roles within the organization till 2017, including associate director for In-House Training, associate director for Public Programs, and Director of NITA/Emory Deposition Program and Director of NITA Appellate Programs, Motions Programs, and Negotiation Programs. From 2004 to 2018, he served as a Consultant at The Carter Center (TCC), specializing in Syria as a country expert, collaborating with NGO partners on UN-related initiatives to outline a post-conflict vision for Syria, and evaluating TCC's GBV programs in conjunction with Emory's Institute for Developing Nations (IDN). Concurrently, he served on the executive committee of the IDN's Board from 2007 to 2017. As Emory University's Program Director for International Advocacy and Dispute Resolution, he designed training programs for lawyers at international courts and conducted rule of law/advocacy training, collaborating with TCC, Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB), NITA, and the Senior Lawyers Project. In addition, he played a key role in global legal education as the Director of the USAID Emory/Universidad Panamericana Partnership from 2013 to 2016, focusing on oral advocacy education in Mexico, and then took on the role of Director of the PI US Russia Foundation Emory/Ural State/Moscow State Partnership from 2016 to 2018, delivering legal training.\nZwier was appointed as an assistant professor of law at the University of Richmond School of Law in 1980, where he advanced to become an associate professor of law in 1983 and a professor of Law until 1999. Following this, he served as the Professor of Law and Director of the Center for Advocacy and Dispute Resolution at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, College of Law from 1999 to 2003. In 2003, he joined Emory University School of Law as a professor of Law and remained there until 2023. He has also undertaken visiting professorships at institutions such as Temple University School of Law in 1988‚Äì89, and William & Mary Law School in Fall 1998.\n\n\n== Research ==\nZwier has researched negotiation, mediation, and legal advocacy.\nZwier's early research has explored concepts of tort law such as by the incorporation of economic analysis into tort law, originating from Judge Hand's formulation of a liability equation based on cost-benefit considerations in United States v. Carroll Towing Co. His subsequent studies focused on diverse legal topics, including Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and their impact on liberty interests, liquidated damages, injunctions, and arbitration agreements. Additionally, his 2021 work underscored the dual nature of Senate impeachment trials, advocating for clarity in trial procedures and jurisdictional scope to uphold integrity and constitutional roles.\n\n\n=== Works ===\nZwier has penned books that delve into legal contexts while also offering principles of negotiation and mediation. One of his works, Advanced Negotiation and Mediation Theory and Practice, co-authored with Thomas Guernsey, has underscored a strategic approach to negotiation, blending tactics to optimize outcomes. Fazzi's review, published in the Dispute Resolution Journal, noted, \"Experience alone hasn't made a good negotiator, but a lack of it could have been detrimental. For a novice practitioner, reading this book may have helped remedy such a deficiency.\" His book Principled Negotiation and Mediation in the International Arena: Talking with Evil has intertwined the development of the rule of law with conflict resolution techniques, proposing an approach to international disputes, suggesting that engaging a pragmatic mediator in negotiations with terrorists and other undesirable actors could prove beneficial for the US. Published in 2020, his work Peacemaking, Religious Belief and the Rule of Law investigated how mediators utilize social media to promote sustainable peace, justice, and forgiveness, using case studies from Syria to evaluate their impact on democracy and peace maintenance within international law.\nAmong Zwier's works on expert witness management and testimony strategies, his book Expert Rules, co-authored with David M. Malone, highlighted tools to handle expert queries, covering problem approaches, Daubert's impact, and effective examination structures. Badger in his review commented, \"The book has discussed everything from finding and feeding an expert to how to prepare one for a deposition.\" In Effective Expert Testimony, he discussed how lawyers can leverage expert witnesses.\nMore recently in 2023, Zwier's work Critical Race Theory and The American Justice System examined how trial lawyers navigated cases involving Black victims killed by white perpetrators, considering CRT skepticism about fair jury judgments and including recent guilty verdicts in high-profile cases that prompted reflection on the American justice system's resilience against CRT critiques. Later in 2023, he published Critical Race Theory and the Struggle at the Heart of Legal Education, a view of the turmoil CRT has caused for legal educators navigating US principles of rule of law.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1998 ‚Äì Honorable Prentice Marshall Faculty Award, Excellence in Teaching and Program Design, NITA\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nExpert Rules: 100 (and more) Points You Need to Know About Expert Witnesses (1999) ISBN 9781556817212\nFact Investigation (2000) ISBN 9781556815324\nLegal Strategy (2005) ISBN 9781556819230\nAdvanced Negotiation and Mediation, Theory and Practice (2005) ISBN 9781601564795\nSupervisory and Leadership Skills in the Modern Law Practice (2007) ISBN 9781556819919\nPrincipled Negotiation and Mediation in the International Arena (2013) ISBN 9781107355200\nExhibit Rules: Tips, Rules, and Tactics for Preparing, Offering and Opposing Exhibits (2013) ISBN 9781601568236\nEffective Expert Testimony (2014) ISBN 9781601563408\nPeacemaking, Religious Belief, and the Rule of Law (2020) ISBN 9780367593582\nCritical Race Theory and the American Justice System (2023) ISBN 9781527593688\n‚Äô‚ÄôCritical Race Theory and the Struggle at the Heart of Legal Education‚Äô‚Äô (2023) ISBN 9781527536234\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nZwier, P.

        "content": "Luke Malicah Saunders (born November 17, 1993) is a Canadian curler and tennis player from Halifax, Nova Scotia. He currently plays third on Team Owen Purcell. He is a two-time defending Nova Scotia Tankard champion and former NCAA Division I tennis athlete.\n\n\n== Curling career ==\n\n\n=== Juniors ===\nSaunders qualified for one Canadian Junior Curling Championship in 2013, playing second for Stuart Thompson. At the provincial champion, the team of Thompson, Scott Babin, Saunders and Alex MacNeil went undefeated to claim the title. Representing Nova Scotia in Fort McMurray, Alberta, the team went through the round robin and championship pools with an 8‚Äì2 record, earning a spot in the playoffs. They then lost to Manitoba's Matt Dunstone 9‚Äì4 in the semifinal, earning the bronze medal.\n\n\n=== Men's ===\nAfter juniors, Saunders move to Chattanooga, Tennessee, for university and did not curl competitively again until the 2017‚Äì18 season, joining the team of Mark Dacey, Andrew Gibson and Stephen Burgess. On tour, the team won the Dave Jones Mayflower Cashspiel, defeating Chad Stevens in the final. They also qualified for the playoffs at the Challenge de Curling de Gatineau and the Jim Sullivan Curling Classic before losing in the quarterfinals. After qualifying for the 2018 Deloitte Tankard through the last chance qualifier, Team Dacey finished 5‚Äì2 through the round robin and earned a playoff spot. They then beat Saunders' former skip Stuart Thompson in the semifinal before coming up short against Jamie Murphy in the final, finishing second. Team Dacey disbanded the following season after not qualifying for the 2019 Deloitte Tankard.\nFor the 2019‚Äì20 season, Saunders joined the newly formed Matthew Manuel rink at third with second Adam Cocks and lead Jeff Wilson. The team immediately found success with playoff appearances at The Curling Store Cashspiel and the Bud Light Men's Cash Spiel. They also qualified for the 2020 Deloitte Tankard. There, Team Manuel finished 4‚Äì3 through the round robin, qualifying for a tiebreaker. They then lost 9‚Äì6 to Chad Stevens to eliminate them in fifth place. Cocks and Wilson left the team after just one season and were replaced by Jeffrey Meagher and Ryan Abraham. In their three events played during the abbreviated 2020‚Äì21 season, the team had a notable second-place finish at the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic where they lost to the Brad Gushue rink in the final. Abraham only stayed with the team for one season and was replaced by Nick Zachernuk.\nDuring the 2021‚Äì22 season, Team Manuel qualified in two of their five events. After a quarterfinal finish at the Dave Jones Mayflower Cashspiel, the team made it to the final of the Superstore Monctonian Challenge where they lost to James Grattan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, the 2022 provincial championship was cancelled. The Nova Scotia Curling Association then decided to appoint Team Paul Flemming to represent Nova Scotia at the 2022 Tim Hortons Brier. The following season, the Manuel rink continued to build on their success from the previous year, reaching the final of the New Scotland Brewing Men's Cash Spiel and the semifinals of the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic and the Superstore Monctonian Challenge. At the 2023 Nova Scotia Tankard, the team lost their first game before rattling off seven straight victories to become both the B and C qualifiers. They then lost the first playoff game against Owen Purcell, forcing a sudden death final. Tied 4‚Äì4 in the tenth, Team Manuel stole a single point for the 5‚Äì4 victory and their first provincial men's title. This qualified the team of Manuel, Saunders, Meagher and Zachernuk for the 2023 Tim Hortons Brier where they finished with a 3‚Äì5 record, earning wins against the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan.\nThroughout the 2023‚Äì24 tour season, the Manuel rink only qualified in three of seven events and did not reach any finals. They had two semifinal finishes in Halifax and Moncton and a quarterfinal result at the Challenge de Curling Desjardins. Despite this, the team dominated at the 2024 Ocean Contractors Tankard, winning all five of their games. This included three victories against the Purcell rink who were ranked higher before the event began. This sent the team to the 2024 Montana's Brier in Regina, Saskatchewan. After struggling out of the gate with three consecutive losses, the team found their footing, rallying off wins against higher seeds Alberta's Aaron Sluchinski, Saskatchewan's Mike McEwen and Alberta's Kevin Koe. They then lost to Nunavut in their penultimate game, eliminating them from contention. They ended on a high note with a victory over Quebec to finish with an even 4‚Äì4 record. At the end of the event, Saunders won the Ross Harstone Sportsmanship Award which is voted on by fellow peers as the curler who best represented Harstone's high ideals of good sportsmanship, observance of the rules, exemplary conduct and curling ability.\nAfter five seasons with Team Manuel, Saunders left to team to join the Owen Purcell rink for the 2024‚Äì25 season.\n\n\n=== Mixed ===\nIn 2019, Saunders won the 2019 Nova Scotia mixed championship playing with his mother Colleen Jones, Peter Burgess and Lindsey Burgess. This qualified the foursome for the 2020 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship in Jonqui√®re, Saguenay where they finished in tenth place with a 4‚Äì5 record. He qualified for his second mixed championship in 2023 with Jones, Paul Flemming and fianc√© Marlee Powers. This squad had much more success, finishing 7‚Äì3 through the round robin and championship pools and qualifying for the playoffs. They then lost to Saskatchewan and Ontario in the semifinal and bronze medal game, finishing fourth.\n\n\n=== Mixed doubles ===\nSaunders began playing mixed doubles with his mother Colleen, but now plays with fianc√© Marlee Powers. In 2024, Powers and Saunders won the Nova Scotia mixed doubles championship, qualifying for the 2024 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship in Fredericton. There, the pair had a strong start with wins in four of their first five games. They then lost both of their last two games on the final day of round robin, eliminating them with a 4‚Äì3 record.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSaunders is employed as a department manager at Waegwoltic Club. He is engaged to fellow curler Marlee Powers who he plays mixed doubles with. His mother is six-time Scotties champion and two-time World champion Colleen Jones and his father is Scott Saunders.\nHe attended the University of King's College until 2013 before moving to Tennessee to attend the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Antalis pretiosa (formerly Dentalium pretiosum), commonly known as the Wampum tuskshell or the Indian money tusk is a species of tusk shell in the family Dentaliidae. It was first described by George Brettingham Sowerby II, and named by Thomas Nuttall in 1860.\nAntalis pretiosa is the primary species of shell known by the colloquial term dentalium, a blanket term describing tusk shells utilized extensively for over 2500 years by Indigenous peoples for both regalia and currency. The shells were referred to as Hy'kwa (also haiqua) in the Chinook Jargon trade language. Trade networks carried A. pretiosa shells far beyond the Vancouver Island sites where the shells were harvested, into the Great Lakes region and as far south as Baja California.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe wampum tuskshell has a narrow, tubular shell. Bill Merrilees describes the shell as a \"sturdy attractive shell\" that resembles a miniaturized elephant tusk. The shell consists of aragonite. Its length ranges between 3.6‚Äì7.5 centimetres (1.4‚Äì3.0 in), Adults are blind. Abbott (1974) notes an average length between 51‚Äì55 millimetres (2.0‚Äì2.2 in). Adults are motile, locomotion for the adult is primarily done through the \"foot\". The foot is used to orient the animal within the sediment and bury it.\n\n\n== Uses by humans ==\n\nThe shells of the wampum tuskshell have been in use for over 2500 years by the Indigenous peoples of North America. Three species of tusk shell are referred to with the historic and ethnographic term \"dentalium\", A. pretiosa, A. entalis, and D. neohexagonum. Only A. pretiosa was significantly used in trade prior to colonization. D. neohexagonum was found in several localities in San Miguel Island, California, while R.B. Clark noted A. entalis \"was never collected by the Indians\", only flooding the market due to demand for tusk shells in trade and introduction by European traders. Formerly in use as currency, they continue to be used in some communities for regalia. \nWorn by both men and women, the shells were used as decorative material for beaded earrings, bracelets, dolls, hair adornments, hats, headdresses, necklaces, and nose pins. They served as an indicator of wealth for the wearer. Due to their natural perforations at both ends, the empty shells were ideal for use in beading.\nThe shells' scarcity, beauty, ease of transport, and difficulty to reproduce made it an excellent source of currency. Between the years of 1750 and 1850, the shells were sought out by both Indigenous peoples and European traders from the Hudson's Bay Company for use in trade. Value was determined by the length of a string of the shells. For traders, shells were strung and measured by the fathom (6 feet (1.8 m)), with approximately 40 shells making up a single fathom. It was traded across considerable distances north, south, and into the interior, and utilized as a currency far beyond the Pacific Northwest, being used across the Prairies and into the Great Lakes and as far south as Baja California. Ethnographic studies note the usage of dentalium shells by the Hupa, Tolowa, and Pomo in California, the Aleuts in Alaska, Western Dene groups, into the Arctic Coast with the Mackenzie Delta Inuit, the Plains Indigenous peoples including the Blackfoot and the Hidatsa, as well as into the Great Lakes Indigenous peoples with the Ojibwe and Saulteaux.\nThe shells were referred to as Hy'kwa (also haiqua) in the Chinook Jargon trade language. Interior tribes along the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers referred to the shells as Iroquois shells, and assuming an eastern origin. R.B. Clark notes that the name could have been a corruption of \"haiqua\". The Alutiiq referred to the shells as Aimhnaq.\n\n\n=== Collection ===\nCollection was done through three methods, collection through the use of an implement, collection by the use of bait, and collection off the beach. In British Columbia, the wampum tuskshell was collected by fishermen who worked from canoe using a device resembling a ‚Äúgreat, stiff broom‚Äù which were extended by sticks to reach depths of up to 21 metres (69 ft). The head of the broom would close by means of a weighted board which was lowered, closing the head and grasping the shells. Phil Nuytten alongside Kwakwaka'wakw carver John Livingston reproduced the device in 1991 which successfully harvested the shells off Kyuquot Sound. In Alaska, G.I. Davydov, a Russian naval officer, reported that the shells were harvested by the Tlingit people off the Charlotte Islands by submerging a human corpse off the coast for several days. When the corpse was recovered, dentalium shells would be clinging to the body. \nEthnographic literature indicates that the source of the shells was limited to western Vancouver Island, between Quatsino Sound and Barkley Sound. The centres of collection occurred in the Nuu-chah-nulth communities of Checleseht, Kyuquot, and Ehattesaht, as well as the Kwakwaka ºwakw communities of Quatsino Sound and Cape Scott.\n\n\n=== Archaeological history ===\nDistribution of dentalium in the prehistoric period was somewhat similar to that of the ethnographic period, with prehistoric period dentalium shells having been recovered further south in California and having not been recovered in the far north. In coastal and Interior Plateau regions, the shell first occurs in sites between 5000 and 6000 years Before Present (BP). The plains have dentalium shells appear in sites at around 4000 BP. Intensive use of dentalium shell begins at 2500 BP and continued into the historic period. \nThe shells were recovered from primarily burial contexts, with the occasional find outside of the burial context. Shells with incised designs on the shell's surface have been recovered from British Columbia to California in addition to sites in the interior plateau.\n\n\n=== Trade history ===\nDentalium trade between Europeans and Indigenous peoples began with James Cook's 1778 arrival at Yuquot, British Columbia. The site became a trading post between American, British, and Spanish traders and explorers. Trade between the Europeans and Indigenous peoples were conducted under the auspices of Maquinna, serving as a middleman who would purchase sea otter pelts in exchange for dentalium and who would then exchange those pelts for other goods. When Europeans discovered that the shells were used as money, trading was conducted directly with Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka ºwakw dentalium harvesters, and trading operations moved to the village of Nahwitti.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nThe wampum tuskshell is currently listed as \"Not evaluated\" by the IUCN Red List, CITES, and Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In British Columbia it is unlisted on the British Columbia Red Blue List as well as on Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe wampum tuskshell is found on the Eastern Pacific. It is distributed from Alaska (Forrester Island), Canada, down to California and Mexico (Baja California peninsula). The maximum latitude for 55 degrees North, and the maximum longitude is -130.88 degrees. The minimum latitude is 32 degrees North, and the minimum longitude is -132.66 degrees.\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\nThe wampum tuskshell inhabits areas of deep water in coarse, clean sand on the seabed's surface. It is found in association with sand dollars and the purple olive snail (Callianax biplicata). It is a benthic organism that occurs in depths of 2‚Äì152 metres (6.6‚Äì498.7 ft). It tolerates temperatures between 6.893‚Äì9.967 ¬∞C (44.407‚Äì49.941 ¬∞F). The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water ranges from 4.37 to 6.534 ml/L. The concentration of dissolved nitrate in the water ranges from 7.622 to 20.476 ¬µmol/l. The saturation of oxygen in the water ranges from 62.799 to 100.512 percent. Water phosphate concentration ranges from 0.963 to 2.1 Œºmol/l. The salinity that the wampum tuskshell is found in ranges from 31.942 to 32.853 psu. The water silicate concentration ranges from 14.539 to 51.234 ¬µmol/l.\n\n\n== Life history ==\nAs a Scaphopod, the wampum tuskshell is gonochoric, meaning each individual is either male or female. It reproduces sexually. Fertilization occurs within the mantle cavity of the organism.\nThe eggs hatch into free-swimming lecithotrophic trochophore larvae. This is then succeeded by shelled veligers, planktonic larvae.\nAdults have a semi-infaunal lifestyle, living their lives partially buried in the sediment. They are slow-moving and feed on particulate organic matter, including algal cells, detritus, diatoms, and foraminifera, as a deposit feeder. Food is mucociliarily enmeshed using a structure known as the captacula, and then is processed using the radula.\nThe shells of the wampum tuskshell form the homes of the toothshell hermit crab (Orthopagurus minimus), whose straight body is unable to fit in curled marine snail shells. These crab-occupied shells were noted to often encrusted by Bryozoans or bear the drill markings as a result of moon snail predation.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe wampum tuskshell was first described by Thomas Nuttall in volume 3 of Thesaurus Conchyliorum by George Brettingham Sowerby II in the genus Dentalium as Dentalium pretiosum. It was moved to the genus Antalis in 2021 by Austin Hendy in A review of the Quaternary Mollusca of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. It is erroneously referred to by Antalis pretiosum in some sources.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSteiner, G.; Kabat, A. R. (2004).

        "content": "Parking functions are a generalization of permutations studied in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics.\n\n\n== Definition and applications ==\nA parking function of length \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n is a sequence of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n positive integers, each in the range from 1 to \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n, with the property that, for every \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n up to the sequence length, the sequence contains at least \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n values that are at most \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. That is, it must contain at least one 1, at least two values that are 1 or 2, at least three values that are 1, 2, or 3, etc. Equivalently, if the sequence is sorted, then for each \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n in the same range, the \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \nth value of the sorted sequence is at most \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nFor instance, there are 16 parking functions of length three:\n\n(1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2),\n(3,2,1), (2,1,3), (1,3,1),\n(1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1),\n(1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1),\n(1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1),\n(1,1,1).\nThe name is explained by the following thought experiment. A sequence of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n drivers in cars travel down a one-way street having \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n parking spaces, with each driver having a preferred parking space. Each driver travels until reaching their preferred space, and then parks in the first available spot. A parking function describes preferences for which all cars can park. For instance, the parking function (2,1,2,1) describes preferences for which the first and third drivers both prefer the second space, while the other two drivers both prefer the first space. The first driver parks in space 2, the second in space 1, and the third in space 3 (because space 2 is taken). The fourth driver starts looking for a free space at space 1, but doesn't find it until space 4; all previous spaces were taken. The sequence (3,3,1,3) is not a parking function: too many drivers prefer space 3, so the last driver starts looking for a space after already passing the only free space, and will be unable to park.\nParking functions also have a more serious application in the study of hash tables based on linear probing, a strategy for placing keys into a hash table that closely resembles the one-way parking strategy for cars.\n\n\n== Combinatorial enumeration ==\nThe number of parking functions of length \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n is exactly  For instance for \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n=3}\n  \n this number is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          4\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        16\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4^{2}=16}\n  \n.\nJohn Riordan credits to Henry O. Pollak the following argument for this formula. On a circular one-way road with \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n+1}\n  \n spaces, each of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n cars will always be able to park, no matter what preference each driver has for their starting space. There are \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        n\n        +\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (n+1)^{n}}\n  \n choices for the preferences, each of which leaves one vacant space. All spaces are symmetric to each other, so by symmetry, there are \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        n\n        +\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n            ‚àí\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (n+1)^{n-1}}\n  \n choices for preferences that leave space \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n+1}\n  \n as the vacant space. These choices are exactly the parking functions. The parking functions can also be placed in bijection with the spanning trees on a complete graph with \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n+1}\n  \n vertices, one of which is designated as the root. This bijection, together with Cayley's formula for the number of spanning trees, again shows that there are \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        n\n        +\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n            ‚àí\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (n+1)^{n-1}}\n  \n parking functions.\nMuch research has studied the number of parking functions of a special form. As a very simple special case, the parking functions that allow each car to park in its own preferred spot are exactly the permutations, counted by the factorials. The parking functions that allow each car to park either in its preferred spot or in the next spot are counted by the ordered Bell numbers.\n\n\n== References ==",

A football team of the same name was established in 1970 by workers of the company.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCreated on June 25, 1920, the Compa√±√≠a Peruana de Telephones Ltda. was created, later merging with the British Peruvian Telephone Company, founded in 1888. By then, the telephone service had only four thousand telephones nationwide, being all manual. Then in 1930, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) acquired 60% of the shares. By December, the first automatic exchange on Jir√≥n Washington in Lima began operating, with capacity for 2,000 more lines.\nOn March 25, 1970, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru decided to nationalise CPT. Then, in 1973, it expropriated the CPT and the National Telecommunications Company (Spanish: Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones) founded a year earlier, with the latter assuming the services provided by the Peruvian branches of the ITT and Ericsson in the interior of the country and leaving the CPT with services in the metropolitan area of Lima. In May 1974, CPT began operating the microwave network.\nIn 1985, during the month of July, the optical fiber link network was implemented. The president of the CPT, on June 4, 1993, reported the privatisation of the company, becoming a public limited company and that the shares belonging to the State would be sold to the private sector. That same year he launched his own cable television company called Cable M√°gico.\nIn 1994, CPT created the subsidiary CPT Celular, focused on mobile telephony. During the government of Alberto Fujimori, the shares of the Peruvian Telephone Company were sold to the Spanish company Telef√≥nica together with the state company Entel Per√∫. On December 31 of the same year, Entel Per√∫ was incorporated into CPTSA. After that, the shortage of telephones in the city of Metropolitan Lima was resolved.\n\n\n=== CPT Celular ===\nCPT Celular was created in 1991 and was later replaced by the Spanish company MoviLine when it was acquired when the Peruvian Telephone Company (CPT) was privatized by the company Telef√≥nica, which became the current Movistar Per√∫, through the government of President Alberto Fujimori. At the beginning of 1995, the company was dissolved due to the bankruptcy of the CPT.\n\n\n=== Football team ===\nA football team of the same name was founded by workers of the company, reaching the third place of the 1975 Copa Per√∫.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMass media in Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

It was unveiled on 21 April 2024, which would have been the Queen's 98th birthday. The 7ft (2.1m) tall sculpture was commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant of Rutland and was funded via donations from businesses and members of the public, at a cost of ¬£125,000. It is the first memorial to Elizabeth II to have been unveiled after her death in September 2022. The statue portrays the Queen in Garter robes and sash wearing the George IV State Diadem, with one royal corgi at her feet and another two on the plinth. Inscribed beneath it are the words \"Queen Elizabeth II, 1926‚Äì2022. Erected as a tribute to her late Majesty through public subscription by Rutland people\". The statue was unveiled by the MP Alicia Kearns in the presence of 400 people and nearly 50 corgis.\n\n\n== References ==",

In December 2022 he reached an agreement to leave Marumo Gallants, promptly signing for AmaZulu. Marumo Gallants manager Dan Malesela called the departure \"painful\". Notable performances include two goals that secured a victory against Cape Town City in September 2023, as well as a hat-trick in the Carling Knockout Cup in November 2023. A renegotiation of Dion's contract, which was due to expire in the summer of 2024, was discussed.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was founded in 1989 by University of Pittsburgh student David E. Schwencke.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1989 as a software company, Full Service Network soon entered the telecommunications landscape in the early 1990s. Throughout the decade as land line phone services became competitive, FSN focused mostly on serving the commercial market of small to mid-size businesses.  In 1998, FSN entered the residential market and had over 10,000 residential subscribers in Western PA and thousands more across Pennsylvania.  They no longer provide residential phone and internet to new customers.\nSince its beginning, FSN has steadily grown and now employs around 85 people in the US Steel Tower in downtown Pittsburgh.  In 2012, Full Service Network was recognized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as one of Pittsburgh's Top Work Places.  And in 2013, the Pittsburgh Business Times awarded FSN with a \"Best Places to Work in Western Pennsylvania\" honor.  As of 2016, Full Service Network has been recognized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as one of Pittsburgh's Top Work Places for 3 years in a row.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Richard Louhenapessy (born 20 April 1955) is an Indonesian former politician of the Golkar party who was the mayor of Ambon, Maluku for two terms between 2011‚Äì2016 and 2017‚Äì2022. Near the end of his tenure in 2022, he was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission for receiving bribery and was sentenced to five years in prison. Prior to becoming mayor, he had been elected four times into the provincial House of Representatives between 1992 and 2009.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRichard Louhenapessy was born in the city of Ambon, Maluku on 20 April 1955. He studied in Christian schools in Ambon, graduating from Xaverius High School in 1973. He would receive his bachelor's in law from Pattimura University in 1985. He had been a member of Pattimura's student organization during his time there between 1976 and 1980, and had also joined the National Committee of Indonesian Youth.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe began to work as a lawyer in 1978, before he graduated from Pattimura. By 1988, he had joined Golkar, and became head of the party's youth organization in Ambon. He was first elected into Malulu's Regional House of Representative (DPRD) in 1992, serving until 1997. In 1999, he was again elected into the DPRD as leader of Golkar's parliamentary group there, and in 2004 became the legislature speaker. In 2006, Louhenapessy took part in Ambon's first mayoral election, and placed second of five candidate pairs with 40,167 votes (27.8%), losing to incumbent mayor Marcus Jacob Papilaja. He was elected for his fourth term in the DPRD in 2009.\nLouhenapessy ran again in the next mayoral election in 2011, and won the election after securing 37% of the votes. He was sworn into office on 4 August 2011. His first term expired on 4 August 2016, and head of the city's trade and industry bureau Frans Yohanes Papilaya was appointed acting mayor to replace Louhenapessy. Louhenapessy ran for a second term in the 2017 mayoral election, and was elected with 82,307 votes (54.65%). His second term began on 22 May 2017.\nDuring his tenure, he promoted Ambon as a \"City of Music\". He joked that an affinity for music is \"part of Ambonese DNA\".\n\n\n== Arrest ==\nThe Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) announced Louhenapessy as a suspect for a bribery case on 13 May 2022. KPK had previously issued an order for Louhenapessy to come to KPK's office in Jakarta, and as he did not come citing a surgery, KPK arrested him. On 9 February 2023, the Ambon District Court sentenced him to five years in prison for receiving bribes, and the Supreme Court of Indonesia upheld his prison sentence upon appeal by KPK. The Supreme Court also reduced restitution payments from Louhenapessy from Rp 8 billion (~USD 530,000) to Rp 520 million (~USD 35,000). As mayor of Ambon, he was replaced in an acting capacity by his deputy Syarif Hadler on 14 May, and as Hadler's tenure expired on 22 May, he was further replaced by City Secretary Agus Ririmasse on 22 May. Ririmasse was replaced two days later by Ministry of Home Affairs appointee Bodewin Wattimena. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe is married to Leberina Louisa Evelin Maatita, and the couple has five children. He is a Protestant Christian.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 2484 is a large lenticular galaxy located in the Lynx constellation. It is situated 560 million light-years away from the Milky Way, which given by its apparent dimensions, means NGC 2484 is around 304,000 thousand light-years across. It is classified a Fanaroff and Riley radio galaxy. \n\n\n== Observation history ==\nNGC 2484 was discovered on 21 January in 1885, by French astronomer Edouard Stephan, who first described the object as \"very faint, very small round with a bright middle and mottled, but not resolved.\" \n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 2484 has an active galactic nucleus. It also hosts a radio source in its center called 3C 189. According to a study, in which exploring the magnetic environment was done, researchers learnt that the rotation measure was complex, which they gave as evidence for anisotropic fluctuations in two regions. An unusual stripe was shown along its jet axis, which has a low uniform rotation measure (RM) in the approaching lobe and arc-like RM structures, showing sign reversals in receding lobes. They found that the amplitude across its source is inconsistent and believed it is most likely caused by compressed gas around the lobe's leading edges.   \nAnother study shows the x-ray emitting atmospheres of NGC 2484 which indicates it as a low-power radio galaxy. There were multiple x-ray components present and each gas component has a wide range of liner sizes that follow cluster X-ray luminosity and temperature correlations, hinting no relationship of its presence and its gas friction, although the intergalactic medium is enough to confine the outer radio structures.  \nNGC 2484 is one of the 8 galaxies to be included as part of the 4th Fermi Point Source Catalogue, among them: MRK 421, MRK 501, NGC 315, 3C 264, 3C 274 and FR 0 galaxy, 4C 39.12. Most of them have low redshifts. It also produces extragalactic jets and is the source of gamma-rays. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fidel Brice Ambina (born 17 November 2001) is a Cameroonian footballer player who plays as a midfielder for V√•lerenga on loan from Cape Town City.\nAmbina started his senior career in Renaissance FC de Ngoumou, and played for Cameroon U20 in the 2021 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations. Ambina moved to South African soccer in February 2022, signing with Cape Town City for four and a half years.\nIn the summer of 2023, Cape Town City reportedly rejected a transfer bid from Riga FC. However, when the South African league had a winter break in 2024, Ambina was not present at its resumption since he was on trial abroad. Ambina was signed by Norwegian club V√•lerenga on a loan until the summer of 2024. Manager Geir Bakke described Ambina as a \"typical number six\". Dagsavisen surmised that Ambina's holding role in the midfield could open more offensive room for Elias Hagen, Petter Strand or Henrik Bj√∏rdal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dirk M. Guldi is a German chemist, academic, and author. He is an adjunct professor at Xi'an University of Science and Technology and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a partner investigator at the Intelligent Polymer Research Institute at the University of Wollongong, as well as a full professor at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg.\nGuldi is most known for his work on photon- and charge management in solar energy conversion schemes, that is, nanometer-scale materials for energy conversion and storage. Among his authored works are his publications in academic journals, including Journal of the American Chemical Society and Angewandte Chemie as well as books such as The Exciting World of Nanocages and Nanotubes and Carbon Nanotubes and Related Structures Synthesis, Characterization, Functionalization, and Applications. He is the recipient of the 2022 lifetime recipient award from the Society of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines.\nGuldi holds the position of co-editor-in-chief for the journals Nanoscale and Nanoscale Advances. Additionally, he also serves as the editor of Photochem.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGuldi earned his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from the University of Koln in 1986, followed by a Master of Science degree in chemistry from the same institution in 1988. He completed his Ph.D. in 1990 from the University of Koln and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Later in 1999, he obtained his Habilitation at Leipzig University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBetween 1990 and 1991, Guldi was a post-doctoral researcher at the National Institute of Standard and Technology prior to working as a researcher at the Hahn-Meitner Institute in the years between 1992 and 1995. In 1995, he joined the University of Notre Dame, initially holding the position of assistant professional specialist from 1995 to 1996, followed by an appointment as associate professional specialist from 1996 to 2004 at the Radiation Laboratory. Since 2013, he has served as an adjunct professor at Xi'an University of Science and Technology and Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Additionally, he holds the role of a partner investigator at the Intelligent Polymer Research Institute at the University of Wollongong. Furthermore, since 2004, he has held the position of a full professor at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg.\nGuldi served as the editor-in-chief for the journal Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and Carbon Nanostructures from 2001 to 2013. Concurrently, he held the position of vice-chairman for the fullerenes, nanotubes, and carbon nanostructures division at the Electrochemical Society from 2004 to 2008, later becoming its chairman from 2008 to 2012. He was elected as a member of the EU Academy of Sciences and European Academy of Science in both 2016 and 2020. Since 2020, he has served as the chairman of the Physical Chemistry Review Board at the German Science Foundation.\n\n\n== Research ==\nGuldi's research has focused on molecular systems. His 2000 study explored achievements in the excited-state properties of fullerene derivatives, emphasizing the photosensitizing and electron-acceptor features of functionalized fullerene materials. It also discussed the impact of functionalization on fullerene characteristics and presented the unique optimization of redox potentials, water-solubility, and singlet oxygen generation for novel fullerene-based materials. While addressing mechanical failures in hybrid polymers and single-wall carbon nanotube materials, his 2002 work proposed employing a layer-by-layer assembly protocol, achieving a nanometer-scale uniform composite with high single walled carbon nanotubes loading and exceptional strength for potential use in long-lifetime devices. In the same year, he collaborated with M. Prato and others to outline a method using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to functionalize carbon nanotubes, yielding soluble bundles with one organic group per 100 carbon atoms, showcasing potential applications in materials science. Moreover, in his exploration of the use of fullerenes, particularly C60, and porphyrins in creating integrated solar energy systems, his work emphasized the impact of C60 as a 3D electron acceptor and discussed how specific porphyrin-C60 compositions affect charge-separation states' rate, yield, and lifetime.\nIn 2014, Guldi examined electron transfer in donor‚Äìbridge‚Äìacceptor molecules, revealing an 840-fold increase in rate with carbon-bridged oligo-p-phenylenevinylene (COPV) due to enhanced electronic coupling and unprecedented inelastic electron tunneling effects at room temperature. In his investigation of singlet fission, a process in which one photon excites two electrons, his joint study with R. Tykwinski and others explored pentacene dimers in an organic solution to increase the triplet yield, which is usually 16% for pentacene to 156%. His 2019 study described the development of a synthetic system, [PBI]5Ru4POM, which mimicked aspects of natural photosynthesis. More recently in 2022, he explored the use of two-dimensional covalent triazine-based frameworks with a red edge effect for chromoselective photocatalysis, demonstrating selective C‚ÄíN cross-coupling reactions while suppressing undesirable dehalogenation processes in dual Ni-photocatalysis.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2003 ‚Äì JSPS Award, The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science\n2004 ‚Äì JPP Award, Society of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines\n2013 ‚Äì Fellow, Royal Society of Chemistry\n2014 ‚Äì Fellow, The Electrochemical Society\n2015 ‚Äì Richard E.

She later engineers his suicide and goes insane.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nIt received a professional production in 1966 starring Googie Withers and Ed Devereaux. It was produced for J.C. Williamsons Ltd. \nWithers said \"It is the first Australian play I feel I can tackle. \"We have high\nhopes for it. It is a human relations play set on a lonely sheep station in Australia. Up until now Australian play writers have followed the same pattern of rollicking Australiana, kangaroos, the outback and all that sort of\nthing. They can't go on writing in that vein and we are\nhoping for more Australian-written plays.\"\nThe play was Brazill's first produced play. He was a librarian.\nThe season lost money. \nAccording to Leslie Rees \"Critics unequivocally condemned Desire of the Moth and aspects of its production, but the author later declared that sixty thousand people saw it in the two cities.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Australian Jewish Herald said \"The best that can be said is that the play is straight theatre,\neasy to follow and a good vehicle for Googie Withers to display her ample talents.\"\nThe Canberra Times called it \"a full bore melodrama\".\nThe Age said \"Mr Brazill has more to learn about writing dialogeue.\"\nThe Bulletin called it a \"Strindbergian opus\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDesire of the Moth",

The creation of this organization was a direct response to the devastating Ancash earthquake of 1970. On September 27, 1987, it was formally created under its current name.\nIn 1998, the investigative team of journalist Ricardo Uceda, who had resigned as editor-in-chief of S√≠ to form a special investigative team at El Comercio in 1994, exposed the misuse of state funds intended for the survivors of floods and mudslides induced by the 1997-98 El Ni√±o event as part of their investigations focused on cases of governmental corruption. The story resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of Civil Defence Chief General Homero Nure√±a.\nArticle 13 of Law No. 29664 defines Indeci as a public executing entity with budgetary authority. Its main responsibility is to coordinate, facilitate and supervise the formulation and implementation of the National Policy and the National Disaster Risk Management Plan. This includes the preparation, response and rehabilitation processes. Under the same law, Indeci is divided into four components of prospective work: estimation, prevention, reduction and reconstruction. In addition, the National Centre for Disaster Risk Estimation, Prevention and Reduction (CENEPRED) was created. However, the creation of Cenepred has sparked some controversies and raised doubts about its effectiveness. Despite these controversies, Indeci continues to play a vital role in disaster risk management in Peru, working closely with regional and local governments to assess damage and needs in the aftermath of disasters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMinistry of Defence (Peru)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The farm will be owned by a joint venture between Genesis Energy Limited and FRV Australia. When complete the farm will cover 93 hectares (230 acres) and generate 63 MW of electricity. At the time of its announcement it was expected to be the largest solar farm in the country when complete.\nThe project was originally announced by HES Aotearoa, who obtained resource consent in June 2022. The project was then brought by a joint venture between Genesis Energy and FRV Australia in February 2023. Construction was announced in January 2024, when Genesis signed a ten-year electricity purchase agreement for the farm. A sod-turning ceremony was held in April 2024, and the farm was expected to be generating electricity by the end of the year.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSolar power in New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Matthew \"Matt\" Manuel (born October 28, 1997) is a Canadian curler from Halifax, Nova Scotia. He currently skips his own team out of the Halifax Curling Club. He is the two-time defending Nova Scotia Tankard champion skip and a four-time Nova Scotia junior champion.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nIn his junior career, Manuel found success skipping his own team, winning four straight Nova Scotia junior championships from 2015 to 2018. His first two titles came with teammates Nick Zachernuk, Ryan Abraham and Alec Cameron. At the 2015 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, the team lost in a tiebreaker 6‚Äì4 to Ontario's Mac Calwell, finishing tenth overall with a 4‚Äì5 record. The following year, they again finished in tenth at the 2016 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, this time with a 5‚Äì4 record. During their time together, the team also represented Nova Scotia at the 2015 Canada Winter Games. After a 4‚Äì1 round robin record, they lost in the quarterfinals 8‚Äì4 to Ontario's Matthew Hall.\nFollowing the 2015‚Äì16 season, Abraham left the team and was replaced by Adam Cocks. The team continued to dominate provincially, securing the 2017 and 2018 Nova Scotia junior titles. At the 2017 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, they just missed the playoffs with a 5‚Äì4 record, settling for fifth. In 2018, Manuel had his best showing with a 6‚Äì4 record, finishing sixth and just missing the tiebreakers. In their last year of juniors, Team Manuel lost in the final of the provincial championship to Graeme Weagle.\nIn university curling, Manuel played for the Dalhousie Tigers at five straight U Sports curling championships from 2016 to 2020. In his first three years on the team, he played third for Robert Mayhew. The team got better at each appearance but never managed to reach the playoffs, finishing with a 4‚Äì3 record in 2018. In 2019, Manuel took over skipping duties of the team. Through the round robin, the team finished first overall with a 6‚Äì1 record before losing both their playoff games, finishing fourth. In his final appearance in 2020, he led the Tigers to the gold medal game where they fell 8‚Äì5 to the undefeated Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks, settling for silver.\n\n\n=== Men's ===\nManuel graduated to men's play for the 2019‚Äì20 season and formed a new team with Luke Saunders, Adam Cocks and Jeff Wilson. The team immediately found success with playoff appearances at The Curling Store Cashspiel and the Bud Light Men's Cash Spiel. They also qualified for the 2020 Deloitte Tankard. There, Team Manuel finished 4‚Äì3 through the round robin, qualifying for a tiebreaker. They then lost 9‚Äì6 to Chad Stevens to eliminate them in fifth place. Cocks and Wilson left the team after just one season and were replaced by Jeffrey Meagher and Ryan Abraham. In their three events played during the abbreviated 2020‚Äì21 season, the team had a notable second-place finish at the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic where they lost to the Brad Gushue rink in the final. Abraham only stayed with the team for one season and was replaced by Nick Zachernuk.\nDuring the 2021‚Äì22 season, Team Manuel qualified in two of their five events. After a quarterfinal finish at the Dave Jones Mayflower Cashspiel, the team made it to the final of the Superstore Monctonian Challenge where they lost to James Grattan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, the 2022 provincial championship was cancelled. The Nova Scotia Curling Association then decided to appoint Team Paul Flemming to represent Nova Scotia at the 2022 Tim Hortons Brier. The following season, the Manuel rink continued to build on their success from the previous year, reaching the final of the New Scotland Brewing Men's Cash Spiel and the semifinals of the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic and the Superstore Monctonian Challenge. At the 2023 Nova Scotia Tankard, the team lost their first game before rattling off seven straight victories to become both the B and C qualifiers. They then lost the first playoff game against Owen Purcell, forcing a sudden death final. Tied 4‚Äì4 in the tenth, Team Manuel stole a single point for the 5‚Äì4 victory and their first provincial men's title. This qualified the team of Manuel, Saunders, Meagher and Zachernuk for the 2023 Tim Hortons Brier where they finished with a 3‚Äì5 record, earning wins against the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan.\nThroughout the 2023‚Äì24 tour season, the Manuel rink only qualified in three of seven events and did not reach any finals. They had two semifinal finishes in Halifax and Moncton and a quarterfinal result at the Challenge de Curling Desjardins. Despite this, the team dominated at the 2024 Ocean Contractors Tankard, winning all five of their games. This included three victories against the Purcell rink who were ranked higher before the event began. This sent the team to the 2024 Montana's Brier in Regina, Saskatchewan. After struggling out of the gate with three consecutive losses, the team found their footing, rallying off wins against higher seeds Alberta's Aaron Sluchinski, Saskatchewan's Mike McEwen and Alberta's Kevin Koe. They then lost to Nunavut in their penultimate game, eliminating them from contention. They ended on a high note with a victory over Quebec to finish with an even 4‚Äì4 record.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nManuel is employed as a junior project manager at Southwest Construction Management. He is engaged to fellow curler Jessica Daigle.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Her research area has been emphasized especially on developing tissue models to investigate the effects of spaceflight stressors, inclusive of ionization of radiation and lunar dust on the human respiratory system.\nShe obtained her bachelor's degree in the field of bioengineering from the University of California in 2015. She also received her master's degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017. She obtained her doctorate degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022. Her doctoral research has focused primarily on stem cell and organ engineering, with an emphasis on engineering lung models that mimic human lung physiology, to study respiratory diseases.\nIn April 2024, she was chosen among NASA‚Äôs four-member new volunteer crew alongside Jason Lee, Stephanie Navarro and Shareef Al Romaithi to participate in a simulated mission to planet Mars within a habitat at the agency's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. She currently lives in San Francisco, USA.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nayombolmi or Najombolmi, who was also known as Barramundi Charlie (c. 1895 ‚Äì 14 August 1967) was a Badmardi (Bininj) and Jawoyn man born at Balawurru, in the Adelaide River region, of the Northern Territory. This area is now the Kakadu National Park.\nNayombolmi is a rock artist and bark painter and he is considered to be \"the most prolific known rock artist in the world\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNayombolmi's parents were Nanggwirid, a Badmardi man, and his mother was a Jawoyn woman whose name is not recorded. He spent his early years living with his family on Badmardi Country and learned to speak many languages and dialects as well as the required bush skills and cultural knowledge. Nayombolmi became a skilled hunter and often brought down water buffalo with a spear and it was for his fishing skills that he became known as 'Barramundi Charlie'.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, as colonisation in the area increased, Nayombolmi began working seasonally for buffalo hunters, such as Tom Cole, and he is also known to have worked as a dingo scalper (dogger), crocodile hunter and gold miner. Between 1929 and 1930 he met with Francis Birtles when he was gold prospecting in the area and, during this period, Nayombolmi decorated Birtles Bean Car with paintings that resembled rock art motifs. These included depictions of an emu, a freshwater crocodile, two turtles, a saratoga (fish), a hand-and-arm stencil and 14 human-like figures. Nayombolmi was not identified as the artist at the time but was later confirmed in an oral history interview with his brother George Namingum. It is likely that during this period Nayombolmi and his family worked for Birtles and his gold mine known as Imarlkba (which was on important ceremonial grounds for the Badmardi clan), which became part of the  Arnhem Land Gold Development Company, which Birtles later sold at great profit. Nayombolmi and his people were they were paid in only food, tobacco and alcohol rather than money.\nIt is not recorded what happened to Nayombolmi during World War II but as of the 1950s he was working as a stockman at Barramundie Station and at a timber camp at Manlarr (Kunwinjku) which were both nearby to Jabiru. It was here that art collectors and art dealers began to visit the area and his bark paintings began to receive recognition and, in the 1960s and 1970s, they were exhibited nationally and internationally.\nNayombolmi continued to work creating rock art and it is recorded that, during the wet season of 1963/1964 he and Nym Djimongurr, a fellow rock artist, jointly created 18 rock paintings in the Burrungkuy (Nourlangie) area and this is now known as the Anbangbang Gallery. The Anbangbang Gallery includes some of the most iconic rock art imagery from Australia and is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.\nIn addition to creating new works Nayombolmi restored older paintings to retain the power of the ancestors and spirits they depict.\nNayombolmi died on 14 August 1967 at Mudginberri Station.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAlthough recognised as a significant artist in his lifetime Nayombolmi's rock art works were not closely documented until the 1980s by George Chaloupka, who worked alongside Nipper Kabirriki, to record information about him and his artwork. Their research, and other research carried out in the following years found approximately 650 pieces of art work distributed over a 1,8000 square kilometre area and that the number of paintings vary from 1 to 55 at a single site.\nHis classificatory granddaughter Josie Maralngurra said that Nayombolmi and her father Djimongurr ‚Äòalways left painting behind‚Äô if they camped more than a day in a shelter'.\nOne of Nayombolmi's bark paintings was included in the National Museum of Australia's Old Masters exhibition in 2013 and one of his rock art figures was reproduced on the bicentennial $10 note in 1988 (Australian).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Between June 28 and 29, 1990, Tuareg rebels from the People's Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MPLA) attacked the Malian Army outpost at M√©naka, sparking the Tuareg rebellion of 1990 to 1996.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the late 1980's, the Kidal Region of northern Mali, predominantly inhabited by Tuaregs, suffered several droughts and spurred many young Malian Tuaregs to enlist in Libya's Islamic Legion. During their time in the legion, many Malian Tuaregs saw their identity as more Tuareg than Malian, and perceived the Malian state as one that did not help them during the various droughts and displacement events of the past.\nIn May 1990, several hundred Tuaregs were arrested by local gendarmes in Tchin-Tabaraden, Niger after a clash with the gendarmes. Angered Tuaregs, viewing the arrests as arbitrary, attacked the town's police station where the detainees were being kept. In pursuit of the attackers, Nigerien forces massacred several hundred Tuaregs.\n\n\n== Raid ==\nOn the evening of June 28, 1990, a troop of around fifty Tuareg fighters of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Azawad commanded by Iyad Ag Ghaly arrived on the outskirts of M√©naka. The fighters traveled on camels and were poorly equipped, having only five Kalashnikovs, two hunting rifles, and sabers. The first ambush by the Tuaregs, in between Menaka and Tedjeret, targeted a convoy from World Vision International. The four Malians and two Americans working in the NGO were dropped off in Ikadewan, and their vehicles were taken.\nThe Tuaregs continued en route to Menaka, and attacked the Malian gendarmerie post in the city around 4am. The gendarmes were taken by surprise, and did not put up much resistance. The MPLA freed the Nigerien Tuaregs in the police station that had been threatened with extradition to Niger. The MPLA looted all the weapons in the gendarmerie's weaponry, and left in eight vehicles from World Vision International and the Italian company Zooconsuit. Gasoline and food were also looted from the Malian Food Products Office location in the town. The MPLA fighters left Menaka at dawn.\nThirty-six Malian gendarmes were killed during the raid and one was injured, according to French Tuareg researcher Pierre Boilley. The Malian newspaper September 22 claimed that fourteen people were killed, including four soldiers.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the raid, various ethnic groups created their own rebel groups to fight against the Malian government, such as Malian Arabs creating the Front for the Liberation of A√Ør and Azaouak (FLAA). Malian President Moussa Traor√© agreed to the Tamanrasset Accords in 1991 creating a special status for Kidal Region, but the accords were never implemented due to the splintering of the MPLA and FLAA and the 1991 Malian coup d'√©tat.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located in the northwest corner of the municipality of El Viejo, in the Chinandega Department. It was also called \"Lacoalguina\".\nThe territory occupied by the Cosig√ºina Peninsula was declared a refuge or asylum area for the protection of wild animals, through a decree published by the government of Nicaragua, on 2 September 1958.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cosig√ºina Peninsula has an area of 93,085 hectares, which is equivalent to 19.3% of the departmental surface. It limits to the north with the Gulf of Fonseca and the Estero Real, to the west and south with the Pacific Ocean and to the east with the volcanic plain of the Buena Vista valley.\nOn the peninsula is the Cosig√ºina Volcano Natural Reserve (RNVC), declared by decree published by the government of Nicaragua, on 19 September 1983. The buffer area of the Cosig√ºina Volcano Natural Reserve begins in the El Congo community, located 39 kilometers from the city of El Viejo, until ending in the Punta √ëata sector on the southwest side and in the Potos√≠ sector on the northeast side of the Cosig√ºina volcano, which is itself the protected area of said Natural Reserve.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The University of Michigan School of Nursing is the nursing school of the University of Michigan, and is located in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nFirst opened as the University of Michigan Training School for Nurses in 1891, the school offered a two-year curriculum. The first nursing degree program for nursing students was inaugurated in 1919. In 1975, the School of Nursing became one of the first nursing school in the United States to offer a research-based Doctorate of Philosophy in nursing.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1891, the University of Michigan Training School for Nurses established in response to a growing need for\nprofessional nurses. The school was organized under the auspices of the Medical School in conjunction with the new University Hospital located on Catherine Street in Ann Arbor. Six students were admitted in the first year of the two-year program.\nThe Regents extended the school from a two-year program to a three-year diploma program in 1902. 130 students were enrolled and the first full-time instructor was appointed in 1915. Admission to the school needed a four-year high school diploma.\nThe first nursing degree program for nursing students was inaugurated in 1919 and consisted of a five-year combined course in nursing and letters.\nIn 1941, the Board of Regents created the faculty of the School of Nursing and named Rhoda Reddig Russell, the director, a professor. There were 12 instructors and one assistant professor on the faculty. Russell was appointed as the first dean of the school in 1955. Until then, the school operated under the direction of an administrative committee including the hospital and medical school.\nThe school offered its first master's program in psychiatric nursing in the fall of 1961. A Master of Science program in medical-surgical nursing was established in 1962. In 1963, the National League for Nursing granted full accreditation to the four-year bachelor program. At this point, the master's programs in medical-surgical and psychiatric nursing were also fully accredited. In 1975, the school added a research-based Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in nursing to its list of degree offerings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of nursing schools in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aƒüa√ßeri was a Turkmen tribe that was attested to be inhabiting parts of Anatolia until the 14th century. They were allied with the Qara Qoyunlu during the 14‚Äì15th centuries but shifted their allegiance to the Aq Qoyunlu upon the downfall of the former. A portion of the tribe remained in Anatolia, while another migrated to Iran.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the tribe was attested by multiple medieval sources. 12‚Äì13th-century Ilkhanid historian Rashid al-Din Hamadani pointed out that the tribe's name was not mentioned in earlier works and referred to an Oghuz group that settled in the forested areas of the Near East, which earned its name. The term means \"people of the forest\" in Turkic languages. Present-day members of the tribe in Iran, primarily those who do not speak Turkic, hold that the name originates in the terms agha (gentleman) and jari (bold), which are lexical borrowings that entered Persian from Turkic.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nSome sources relate the tribe's origins to the Akatziri tribe that inhabited Russia in the 5th century. However, medieval historians including Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad, Abu al-Faraj, Rashid al-Din Hamadani, Aziz ibn Ardashir-i Astarabadi, Badr al-Din al-Ayni, and al-Maqrizi mentioned the tribe's Turkmen origin. Historian Faruk S√ºmer suggests that Aƒüa√ßeri may be related to the Turkmens who previously initiated the Babai revolt as they inhabited the same region around Malatya. In 1246, tribesmen were known to have fought against Baiju Noyan (r.‚Äâ1241‚Äì47, 1251‚Äì55), the commander of the Mongol Empire in the Near East. A group of the tribe was the dominant tribe near Khalkhal, Iran, where they neighbored the Daylamites and are thought to have been brought to the region following the capture of Alamut by Hulegu Khan (r.‚Äâ1256‚Äì65), a Mongol commander who was the founder of the Ilkhanate after the division of the Mongol Empire.\n\n\n=== Relations with the Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu ===\nDuring the second half of the 14th century, the tribe forged an alliance with the Qara Qoyunlu. Its head at the time, Hasan, was the son of Tatar Khatun, who was the sister of Qara Mahammad (r.‚Äâ1380‚Äì89), the ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu. In the next century, the tribe migrated to Iran along with the Qara Qoyunlu tribe. Members of the tribe, Husayn, Sulan, and Ali Beg were chieftains loyal the Qara Qoyunlu ruler Iskandar (r.‚Äâ1421‚Äì29, 1431‚Äì36). Ali Beg was among the ranks of the Qara Qoyunlu forces in the skirmish against the Aq Qoyunlu tribe in 1450. He was captured but later released by the Aq Qoyunlu.\nUpon the downfall of the Qara Qoyunlu, Ali Beg and various other Aƒüa√ßeri lords entered in the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan's (r.‚Äâ1453‚Äì78) service. Aƒüa√ßeri tribesmen continued to serve various Aq Qoyunlu lords, such as Hajji Hasan and D√ºndar-i Ahaj Eri who served Jahan Shah Mirza and Uzun Hasan's son Zeynel Mirza, respectively.\n\n\n=== Aƒüa√ßeri in Iran ===\nAƒüa√ßeri is not mentioned in Safavid chronicles. When Tabriz temporarily came under Ottoman control in the first half of the 18th century, a tahrir defter attested a nearby village that was the namesake of the tribe of Aƒüa√ßeri. \nMuch of the tribe was forced to transition into a sedentary life in Behbahan in c.‚Äâ1820 in order to defend the town from the violent tribes of Bakhtiari and Boir Ahmadi. The nomadic portions of Aƒüa√ßeri were eventually absorbed by the latter and became known as Aqa'i. In the mid-19th century, Aƒüa√ßeri appeared in records as a wealthy tribe of 1000 tents in Fars province incorporating the sub-tribes of Chaghatai and Kashtil. By the next century, the tribe was known to be inhabiting Kohgiluyeh and included the sub-tribes of Afshar, Begdili, and Tileku. \nHistorian Pierre Oberling describes the Aƒüa√ßeri of Kohgiluyeh as a tribe of mixed origin inhabiting Khuzestan. Vladimir Minorsky classified them as part of the Kohgiluyeh Lurs but noted that it was composed of the Turkic tribes of Afshar, Chaghatai, Begdili, and Qarabaghi. Other early 20th-century sources, Fasa'i and Demorgny referred to them as an \"amalgamation of Turkic, Tajik, and Lur elements.\" Oberling links some of the constituent tribes to the Afshars of Khuzestan, who Shah Abbas the Great (r.‚Äâ1587‚Äì1629) had scattered over the region following a rebellion in 1596‚Äì97. Oberling further proposes a tie between the Aƒüa√ßeri of Kohgiluyeh and the Qashqai Kashkuli Bozorg tribe of western Fars as both incorporate the sub-tribes of Begdili and Jama Bozorg.\nDemorgny put the population of Aƒüa√ßeri around Behbahan at 2000 families in 1913. Oberling noted that the number was over 1000 in the 1950s. It consisted of the following sub-tribes: Jama Bozorgi, Tileku, Chaghatai, Begdili, Afshar, Lor Zaban, She'ri, Aqbaghi, Bashiri, Daylami, Kashtil, and Davudi. A portion of the tribe retained their Turkic language, but most conversed in Persian and Luri. Many of the tribesmen have moved to Abadan, Bandar-e Mahshahr, and Aghajari, where they work under the National Iranian Oil Company.\n\n\n=== Aƒüa√ßeri in Turkey ===\nThe remnants of the tribe in Anatolia who did not depart for Iran split into smaller tribes for economic reasons and spread across the peninsula. These tribes are identified with the modern-day Tahtacƒ±. This group inhabits various regions of Turkey, such as √áukurova, Mersin, Antalya, Isparta, Burdur, Konya, Muƒüla, Denizli, and Aydƒ±n. In parallel with Aƒüa√ßeri's etymological explanation, Tahtacƒ± are known for woodworking.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOberling, Pierre (1984). \"A·∏°ƒÅƒç Erƒ´\".

        "content": "Stolen Moments is a 1978 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nStolen Moments is the 16th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 46 years old and released by the Muse Records label in the United States in 1978. The recording is noted for the title tune and was one of Murphy's more successful releases. Murphy contributes the lyrics to Oliver Nelson's \"Stolen Moments\" which became a signature tune for Murphy. Richie Cole is featured on alto saxophone.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe instrumental \"Stolen Moments\" from The Blues and the Abstract Truth (1961) by Oliver Nelson, one of the best selling jazz albums, was a successful jazz standard by the time Murphy recorded his version. Author Ted Gioia calls the tune \"a querulous hard-bop chart that...sounds almost painfully sophisticated\".\nMurphy told John Watson in an interview that when he first arrived in the UK in 1964, the Oliver Nelson record was getting a lot of play and the song \"Stolen Moments\" stuck with him. He was inspired to write the lyrics. He said, \"I like what the lyrics say about two people snatching time to be together, not giving a damn about what the rest of the world says.‚Äô‚Äô He sang the song at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. He also sang it in tour in Europe. Then he put it away for about 10 years. Peter Jones recounts in his biography,This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, that in the late 1970s Murphy was looking through his charts when he re-discovered the lyrics for \"Stolen Moments\". Murphy said, \"I started to do it at the clubs, and the kids liked it, and were always asking, 'Can you do that \"Stolen Moments\" again'?\" So Murphy got the idea to do a big band album. He and Joe Fields, from Muse, enlisted Mitch Farber to do the arrangements and hire the musicians.\nUp until two days before the recording session Murphy had intended the centerpiece of the album to be Joe Zawinul's \"Birdland\". But permission to record the song with Murphy's own lyrics was denied. The tune would be featured on The Manhattan Transfer's 1979 release Extensions with lyrics by Jon Hendricks, which would win the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance. Incidentally, Richie Cole appears on the Manhattan Transfer's album.\nMurphy's recording of \"Stolen Moments\" received a lot of airplay in the US and became a favorite in his live performances. It became a signature tune for Murphy. Years later, in 1995, the Canadian dance company Decidedly Jazz Danceworks produced a 1940s detective movie spoof in dance entitled \"Stolen Moments\" which was built around Murphy's music. Artistic director Vicki Adams Willis and Mich√®le Moss choreographed dance to the song and others from Murphy's repertoire as part of a show in Calgary that featured Murphy narrating and vocalizing in a trench coat in the second act. \"I guess there's some kind of dance connection in my singing,'' Murphy said, \"because I was discovered by Sammy Davis Jr., one of the world's greatest tap dancers''.\nMurphy's first recording of the song was for Dutch radio in 1970 and it also appears on North Sea Jazz Sessions, Volume 5, a collection of 1970s recordings with the Louis Vandyke Trio released in 1992. An extended 13 minute version of \"Stolen Moments\" with two scat solos is included on the live set Just Jazz from 1993 with the Karlheinz Miklin Quartet from a concert in Graz, Austria. Three versions of the song are also prominently featured later in Murphy's career on his album Love is What Stays with Till Br√∂nner in 2007.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMitch Farber did the arrangements and brought in the session musicians. He worked closely with Murphy, saying, \"He knows precisely what he wants to hear and what the charts must do.‚Äô‚Äô Murphy did the vocal arrangements himself. Richie Cole is featured extensively on alto saxophone. They had been performing together in San Francisco jazz clubs. Cole would have a close association with Murphy, appearing on Satisfaction Guaranteed (Muse, 1980) and Bop for Kerouac (Muse, 1981). Cole's tune \"D.C. Farewell\" is also included on Stolen Moments.\nVince Lateano is on drums and would later appear on Murphy's September Ballads in 1988. In the liner notes Murphy says, ‚Äò‚ÄòI‚Äôm always a time singer. I bounce off the time values...I must have a wonderful drummer who agrees with me on that time conception. That‚Äôs what generates my motors!‚Äô‚Äô The bass players are Chuck Metcalf and Paul Breslin. Jack Gobbetti is on percussion, and he makes a later appearance with Murphy on the 2017 HighNote release Wild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner from a 1980 concert. The remainder of the band includes Smith Dobson on piano, Jim Nichols on guitar, Mark Levine on trombone, and Warren Gale on trumpet.\nMurphy records \"Waters of March\" by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim on this release and his version is considered definitive by some critics. Will Friedwald credits Murphy as the earliest American jazz singer to sing it, saying, \"His treatment of \"Waters\" has an urgency, a dynamism not heard in those of other singers, North or South American,\" and \"The Waters of March\" might as well be \"The Waters of Mark\".\nMurphy records Annie Ross' vocalese lyrics to Art Farmer's \"Farmer's Market\". Peter Jones says that though Ross \"wrote the bonkers\" lyrics it was Mark Murphy who was \"the one who really nailed the vocal, rendering Ross's tongue-twisters effortlessly despite the suicidal tempo\". Though Murphy had previously recorded the tune, this was its first release. Jones says, \"His extraordinary verbal facility is on show in this tricky all-vocal/no solos Art Farmer/Annie Ross vocalese number, its big range requiring flips into falsetto\".\nThe ballad \"Again\" was sung by Ida Lupino in the 1948 film Road House, a favorite of Murphy. He performed it often live during this period of his career. Several of Michael Franks' tunes were recorded by Murphy, here he includes \"Don't be Blue\". Herbie Hancock's \"Sly\" from his 1973 album Head Hunters is included. ‚Äò‚ÄòI like Sly. It‚Äôs a rock thing and yet keeps the line in the Lp in all these lyrics; it gives a kaleidoscope of my interests. I‚Äôm pleased with my words for Herbie Hancock‚Äôs music,‚Äô‚Äô Murphy explained in the liner notes. \"Smith plays the lines and Jim Nichols plays his butt off underneath. His playing here is worth the price of the record! Smith plays great through the whole thing. In fact, everyone does. I was turned on to it all‚Äù.\n\n\"We'll Be Together Again\" is a ballad Murphy had success with in his live performances. ‚Äò‚ÄòI use a 12/8 feel on the drums on the ballads, allowing me to do it incredibly slow. Yet it doesn‚Äôt drag. You completely go with the word ‚Äòslow‚Äô or you go with the word ‚Äòfast‚Äô. There is nothing in between‚Äîthere isn't kind of slow or kind of fast. Hey, just listen to the words. . . it's all there.‚Äô‚Äô \"Like a Lover (O Cantador)\" is a ballad that caught Murphy's attention after hearing Flora Purim sing it. Murphy had an affinity for Brazilian jazz music, often including Brazilian songs on his albums and often sung in Portuguese. He would devote two complete albums to the music, Brazil Song (Canc√µes Do Brasil) (1983, Muse) and Night Mood: The Music of Ivan Lins (1987, Milestone).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide assigns the album 4 stars (meaning, excellent: Four-star albums represent peak performances in an artist's career. Generally speaking, albums that are granted four or more stars constitute the best introductions to an artist's work for listeners who are curious).\nThe Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music gives the album 3 stars (meaning, good, by the artist's usual standards and therefore recommended.)\nThe AllMusic guide assigns 4 stars. Scott Yanow writes, \"One of singer Mark Murphy's most famous records, this album finds him at the peak of his powers. This version of the title cut is considered a classic... Essential music\". He singles out \"Farmer's Market,\" Jobim's \"Waters of March\" and \"Like a Lover\". In his own book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide, Yanow lists the album as one of the best individual Muse sets, and writes of Murphy, \"A brilliant vocal innovator, Mark Murphy can turn a song inside out in his improvisations, jumping between falsetto and low bass notes, or he can treat a ballad with real sensitivity. Based in the bebop tradition, Murphy (like Betty Carter) came up with his own individual way of extending the music. He has also been a highly influential vocal teacher and a lyricist who has written words to the songs\".\nMusichound Jazz: The Essential Album Guide assigns 4.5 bones (that is, four stars).\nPeter Reilly reviewing Stolen Moments for Stereo Review (June 1979) said the album \"is one of the freshest, most imaginative, and most expertly entertaining albums of the year\". He wrote about Murphy, \"No matter what the material, Murphy has the sure touch of a man who knows instinctively what artistic results he wants to achieve\". Reilly credits the supporting musicians, \"in particular Richie Cole, whose alto sax is almost Murphy's co-star here\".\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones includes the album in his list of top 10 essential Mark Murphy albums. He also listed \"Farmer's Market\" (track 3) as part of his article10 tracks by Mark Murphy I Can‚Äôt Do Without‚Ä¶ in the London Jazz News series \"10 Tracks I Can't Do Without\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Stolen Moments\" (Oliver Nelson, Mark Murphy) ‚Äì 5:47\n\"Again\" (Lionel Newman, Dorcas Cochran) ‚Äì 3:31\n\"Farmer's Market\" (Art Farmer, Annie Ross) ‚Äì 2:54\n\"D.C.

        "content": "Aquilone (Italian: Aquilone) was an Italian Nembo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1903, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1923.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\nAquilone was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, on 10 September 1899 and launched on 16 October 1902. She was commissioned in 1903.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Aquilone‚Ä≤s took place in 1910. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. Sometime between 1914 and 1918, Aquilone underwent additional modifications in which minelaying equipment was installed aboard her.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nAquilone participated in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy‚Ä≤s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. She was assigned at the time to the 2nd Squadron's 4th Division along with her sister ships Borea, Nembo, and Turbine. On 4 May 1912, Aquilone and Nembo occupied the island of Lipsos in the Dodecanese in the Aegean Sea. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Aquilone, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Pontremoli, as well as Borea, Nembo, Turbine, and their sister ship Espero made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto. On the afternoon of 23 May 1915, the day Italy declared war, Aquilone and Turbine got underway to patrol in the Adriatic Sea along the Italian coast as far north as Manfredonia. While Aquilone and Turbine were on patrol, numerous Austro-Hungarian Navy ships left port during the night of 23‚Äì24 May 1915 to carry out previously planned bombardments of military targets and coastal cities along Italy's Adriatic coast. At 04:10 on 24 May Aquilone sighted the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser Helgoland, which was bombarding Barletta, and steered to attack Helgoland, but soon found herself having the worst of the clash as Helgoland interrupted her bombardment and pursued the smaller and less-heavily armed Aquilone. At around 04:30, Turbine arrived on the scene, having identified Helgoland from a range of 9,000 metres (9,800 yd) and closed at high speed to distract Helgoland both from her pursuit of Aquilone and from her bombardment of Barletta. As Aquilone pulled away, Helgoland shifted fire to Turbine. Aquilone escaped, but Helgoland and the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Csepel, Lika, and T√°tra sank Turbine.\nOn 31 May 1916 the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Balaton and Orjen attacked the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto and sank the naval drifter Beneficent ‚Äì a modified fishing boat that tended the antisubmarine nets of the barrage ‚Äì and Aquilone and the torpedo boat Centauro got underway from Brindisi in response.  Aquilone, Centauro, the auxiliary cruiser Citt√† di Siracusa, and the destroyer Ardito forced Balaton and Orjen to withdraw.\nOn 23 August 1916 Aquilone, under the command of an officer named Farina, departed Vlor√´ (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania participated with the armored cruiser Francesco Ferruccio, the torpedo cruiser Minerva, the minesweeper Taide, and two gunboats to occupy Porto Palermo on the coast of Albania. The occupation went smoothly: Francesco Ferruccio landed a platoon of sailors, and the small garrison of Greek gendarmes retreated without offering any resistance.\nAquilone continued her World War I service without taking part in any other significant actions. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter World War I ended, Aquilone underwent modifications to her superstructure which involved removing of one of her three funnels and moving her bridge aft. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken from the naval register in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W.

        "content": "Marie-Madeleine Peyronnet, born on 30 June 1930 in De Foucauld (French Algeria,  now Rechaiga, Algeria , and died on 24 April 2023 in Digne-les-Bains, was personal secretary to explorer Alexandra David-N√©el  from 1959 to 1969. Nicknamed \"Tortue\" (Tortoise) by the latter, she worked for her for the last ten years of her life. She wrote a biography of the last ten years of Alexandra David-N√©el's life.   She has also edited Alexandra's writings, including her extensive correspondence with her husband from 1904 to 1940 (in 2 volumes).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarie-Madeleine Peyronnet was born on 30 June 1930 in De Foucauld (French Algeria,  now Rechaiga, Algeria ). She grew up in Recha√Øga, Algeria, where her family has been settled for four generations. Her father, a former soldier, was a civil servant. Marie-Madeleine was raised in a strict, bourgeois Catholic family, but dreamed only of traveling. \nAt the age of 29, after spending all her youth in Alg√©rois, Marie-Madeleine  came to stay with her sister, who owned a hotel, in Aix-en-Provence. It was during this stay that she met by chance Alexandra David-N√©el, who was herself staying in Aix and looking for a secretary. Marie-Madeleine was initially hired for three months as a private secretary, but she remained in the service of the explorer for the last ten years of her life in Digne-les-Bains \nHaving inherited the right to live at Samten Dzong (in Tibetan : \"Fortress of Meditation\"), Alexandra David-N√©el's home, she contributed to the republication of the work written by the explorer in Digne-les-Bains (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence) after the latter's death on 8 September 1969\nIn 1977, she founded the Alexandra David-N√©el Association. This is a not-for-profit association under French law,  which has developed the museum by enriching its collections.\nEmployed by the town of Digne-les-Bains, Marie-Madeleine Peyronnet managed the museum until 1995, organising the daily reception of tourists and French and foreign VIPs accompanied by their translators, including Tibetan visitors such as the 14th Dalai Lama in 1982 and 1986, Tibetan folk troupes, musicians, other artists (butter and wood sculptors) and monks who came to make sand mandala which were then exhibited in the museum. \nMarie-Madeleine collected and published the Lettres √† son mari (Letters to her husband) and other posthumous books by Alexandra David-N√©el. In 1973, she published a biography, Dix ans avec Alexandra David-N√©el, transferring the copyright to the association. The book, written in three weeks, was published by Plon and won the Prix des Journalistes (The Journalists' Prize) and was shortlisted for the Prix V√©rit√©. A new edition was published in 2005, with five additional texts added in 2003 when a German translation was published by Nymphenburger Verlag.\nA biography of Marie-Madeleine Peyronnet was written and published in 2018 by Jo√´lle D√©sir√©-Marchand, who had already published a biography of Alexandra David-N√©el in 2009.\nShe died on 24 April 2023 in Digne-les-Bains.\n\n\n== Nicknamed ‚ÄúTortue‚Äù ==\n\nAlexandra David-N√©el gave Marie-Madeleine the nickname ‚ÄúTortue‚Äù (Tortoise) after a banal incident. As she walked towards a staircase, she saw a stocking rolled into a ball at her feet, which she mistook for a tortoise. After calling Marie-Madeleine to ask her to take it off and look after it, they discovered together, bursting into laughter, the true nature of the object. From that day on, Alexandra nicknamed her ‚ÄúTortue‚Äù, first out of amusement, then out of habit.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOrdre des Arts et des Lettres Chevalier (Knight),(1996).\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Autobiography ===\nPlon, ed.

        "content": "Back in Action is a 1994 Canadian action film directed by Steve DiMarco and Paul Ziller, starring Billy Blanks, Roddy Piper, Bobbie Phillips and Nigel Bennett. Blanks and Piper play contrasting types on a mission to take down a criminal cartel who threatens the former's sister, and killed the latter's police partner.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe project started life as a vehicle for Canadian-based actor/producer Jalal Merhi. It was going to be a sequel to his 1992 film Talons of the Eagle (hence the sequel-styled title of Back in Action), and bring back the three stars from his 1993 offering TC 2000: Billy Blanks, Bobbie Phillips and Merhi himself. However, Merhi found his U.S. distributor and financier Shapiro-Glickenhaus Entertainment increasingly reluctant to work with him. Following some legal wranglings, Merhi was squeezed out of the project and replaced by Roddy Piper, while Blanks and Phillips remained on board.\nSubstituting Merhi's company Film One, SGE signed another Toronto outfit as its production partner, George Flak's Performance Pictures. Karl Schiffman, a friend of Flak's, was brought in and instructed to rewrite the script from scratch based on a stock buddy movie template, which he did in two weeks. Filming took place in the Toronto metropolitan area, starting on July 5, 1993, and concluding on August 13. Steve DiMarco was originally announced as the sole director, but he butted heads with SGE and was fired partway into the shoot to be replaced by Paul Ziller.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nBack in Action opened in Canadian theaters on June 3, 1994, through Cineplex Odeon Films.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn the U.S., the film premiered on home video through MCA/Universal Home Video, which whom SGE had an output deal, on July 13, 1994. The film's British VHS preceded its domestic bow, arriving on March 9, 1994, from Guild Home Video.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBack in Action has received mixed reviews. Rob Salem of The Toronto Star was most positive, calling it \"[t]he exception to the rule\" that low-budget Toronto action films lack in quality, and finding it far superior to Merhi's TC 2000. He judged that it was \"inventively directed\" and \"often explosive\", while Piper and Blanks \"ma[de] a good team\". He concluded that the film was \"one of those rare times when a sequel is not only appropriate but almost required.\" The BBC's Radio Times called it \"[a]n incredibly brutal film that boasts about one shoot-out or bone-breaking fight every ten minutes but, to its credit, it doesn‚Äôt take itself that seriously, and it‚Äôs sure to please action fans looking for some dumb, violent fun.\" Hal Erickson of AllMovie wrote that \"[a]fter the usual 'I don't like you and you don't like me' palaver, Piper and Blanks combine their considerable self-defense skills to kick a lot of LaLa-land butt. It ain't Hamlet, but it's a lot of fun.\"\nIn his publication VideoScope, genre critic Joe Kane called the film \"a nearly nonstop series of shoot-outs, chases, and punch-ups that, while energetically staged, grow too numbingly repetitious even for diehard action hounds.\" He deemed that \"this exercise in kinetic brawn would have benefited from a bit more brain\". Mike Mayo of The Roanoke Times and VideoHound's Video Premieres \"[a] standard-issue buddy picture. Roddy Piper plays a cop who joins forces with martial arts favorite Billy Blanks as a Special Forces veteran to save Blanks' sister from gangsters. The fight choreography is cliched, though there are some scenes where Piper really cuts loose with full Wrestlemania craziness.\" Sight & Sound, the British Film Institute's magazine, assessed that \"[m]id-range martial-arts star Blanks teams up with Piper for a by-numbers action vehicle\". Contrary to the Toronto Star, TV Guide did not find it a meaningful improvement over Blanks' Merhi-produced films, calling it: \"a disposable, direct-to-video action bloodbath from the creators of the substantively similar Talons of the Eagle and TC 2000.\"\n\n\n== Follow-up ==\nSchiffman was booked to write a treatment for a direct sequel, which came close to getting into production, but SGE instead opted to commission a spiritual successor starring Piper and Blanks from a different team. The result was the similar but narratively distinct Tough and Deadly. Flak did re-team with Piper on 1995's Jungleground for Norstar Entertainment.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBack in Action at IMDb \nBack in Action at AllMovie",

It was originally published by Giramondo Publishing in Australia in 2015. \n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe novel follows three generations of one family, across the timespan of a week, who experience of period of disruption and crisis. The grandparents face a health scare and must leave their comfortable domestic life; the parents appearing to be in the process of separating over the mother's extra-marital affair, and the youngest daughter has reached a major turning-point in her teenage years.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by Giramondo Publishing in 2015, the novel has not been reprinted.\n\n\n== Dedication ==\nDedication: \"For my children Kelso, Toby and Penelope\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting in The Sydney Review of Books critic Kerryn Goldsworthy stated: \"The novel‚Äôs pace may seem leisurely, its voice measured and its mode of expression thoughtful and reflective, but its subject matter is operatic: sex, class, family, love, death, change, and the pull of the past...Gorton‚Äôs way of seeing the world and of naming its parts is the quality that sets her debut novel apart from the mass of fiction currently being published in Australia...Gorton‚Äôs novel is less of an argument and more of a painting, a visual representation of a certain kind of family in a particular time and place, a picture from which it is possible to deduce its subjects‚Äô character, class, and mood: a Vermeer or a Pieter de Hooch, showing rooms in shadowy houses and ordinary people in attitudes of contemplation, standing in a certain slant of light.\"\nIn The Australian Book Review Catriona Menzies-Pike wrote: \"The lives of the characters in this novel can‚Äôt be unpicked from the spaces they inhabit...How do our houses define us? Gorton‚Äôs reflections on space and identity have little in common with the real-estate fixations of reality television...The Life of Houses is a nuanced and intelligent reflection on the spaces mothers and daughters share.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2016 Prime Minister's Literary Awards ‚Äì Fiction, joint winner\n2016 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards ‚Äì Christina Stead Prize for Fiction, shortlisted\n\n\n== See also ==\n2015 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Iraq Development Road is an undergoing project aming to connect Asia with Europe by establishing a network with railways, roads, ports and cities. The project will link the Grand Faw Port in southern Iraq to T√ºrkiye's border and further extending into Europe.\nThe project is expected to turn the country into a transit center by shortening the travel time between Asia and Europe in an attempt to compete with Egypt's Suez Canal. The project is expected to strengthen Iraq's geopolitical position in the region and the world, in addition, the project will support security and stability in the region. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Development Road gained attention first during a visit to Iraq by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the G20 Summit in New Delhi. Sometimes dubbed as the \"Iraqi Silk Road\", the project was discussed as an alternative route to the Suez Canal, being created to ease faster and more efficient trade between Asia and Europe.\nIn May 2023, Baghdad hosted a summit which brought together transport ministers and officials from the European Union, the World Bank,  GCC, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Jordan to discuss the establishment of the Development Road initiative. During the summit, Iraqi officials noted that \"Iraq has recovered and retrieved its pivotal political role in the region, becoming a political convergence point, the time has come for the country to retrieve its economic role\".\nIn April 2024, and during a visit to Baghdad by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, quadrilateral memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation in Development Road project signed between Iraq, T√ºrkiye, Qatar, UAE. The deal was inked by the transportation ministers from each country.  The 1,200-kilometer project with railway and highways which will connect the Great Faw Port, aimed to be the largest port in the Middle East. It is planned to be completed by 2025 to the Turkish border at an expected cost of $17 billion.\nObservers and decision-makers note that the project is planned to be completed in three stages by 2028, 2033 and 2050 and will open Iraq to the world through T√ºrkiye, and will generate $4 billion annually and create at least 100,000 jobs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrand Faw Port\nBerlin‚ÄìBaghdad railway\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ghazipur landfill is a landfill waste dumping site established in 1984. It is located in Ghazipur, a village in the eastern district of Delhi, India.\nThe landfill covers an area of approximately 70 acres (28 ha) and reaches heights of over 150 feet (46 m). Ghazipur has become one of the largest landfills in Delhi. The landfill reached its maximum capacity in 2002; however, it continues to receive solid waste from the city of Delhi.\nDespite efforts to mitigate problems, long term mismanagement at the landfill has created significant ongoing environmental, fire, and human health hazards, with the site emitting toxic gases, polluting groundwater, and creating an extreme fire hazard.\nA major fire broke out at the landfill site on 21 April 2024; the fire rapidly spread, engulfing several areas of the landfill. Toxic smoke from the fire has caused significant health and breathing problems. The cause of the fire is undetermined.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBhalswa landfill\nMavallipura\nWaste management in India\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKumar, S. (2023).

        "content": "Legion of Good Will (LGW, Portuguese: Legi√£o da Boa Vontade, LBV) is a Brazilian charitable, non-profit organization, whose purpose is the social work, promoting education, culture and ecumenism. Was founded on January 1, 1950, by the radio personality Alziro Zarur, inspired by spiritism. The institution has autonomous units in Portugal, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, the United States and Uruguay.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn January 6, 1948, Alziro Zarur was at a meeting of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation when a medium told him that Saint Francis, who would be accompanying him, had told him it was time to start. This prompted the radio host to research the saint's life and discover his mission.\nA year later, he started a program on R√°dio Globo called Hora da Boa Vontade (Hour of Good Will), preaching the Apocalypse, which made the program a huge success. In 1950, on January 1, Brazil's Universal Brotherhood Day, he officially founded the organization. Zarur led the organization until his death in 1979, when he was replaced by radio presenter and writer Jos√© Paiva Netto.\nThe organization became known for its Charity Rounds, which distributed soups, food and clothes, and offered minor nursing and barbering services to the homeless. In 1998, in partnership with the TV channel Rede Bandeirantes, it carried out one of the most massive solidarity mobilizations ever seen in Brazil on behalf of agricultural workers affected by the drought in northeastern Brazil. The organization distributed more than 4.1 million kilos of food to around a million people in more than 1,100 locations.\nThe LGW was the first Brazilian non-governmental organization to join the United Nations Department of Public Information (DPI) in 1994. In 1999, it also became the first Brazilian NGO to gain general consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2000, it joined the Conference of NGOs with Consultative Relations to the United Nations (Congo) in Vienna, Austria.\n\n\n== Religious aspect ==\nThe LGW is an ecumenical association, with a tendency towards popular spiritism, but not linked to it. The Temple of Good Will, created and built with help from the institution, was inaugurated on October 21, 1989. Not long afterwards it became the most visited monument in Brasilia, receiving more than a million pilgrims every year, according to official information.\nNext to the Temple of Good Will, possibly inspired by Bahaism, the World Parliament of the Ecumenical Brotherhood (ParlaMundi) was established, a forum for debate for all the people and institutions in Brazil and the world who work for the betterment of man and his eternal Spirit. It has the Students' Hall - a place that unites human knowledge with the lights of spiritual teachings for the formation of the Ecumenical Citizen - attended annually by more than 150,000 young people.\n\n\n== Structure and actions ==\nIn Brazil, the organization runs 83 socio-educational units, including basic education schools, vocational training schools, shelters for the elderly, Community Social Assistance Centres and Humanitarian Assistance Centres.\nIn the United States, one of its educational initiatives is to offer free OSHA classes with cards to low-income workers in Newark who want to increase their wages by entering the construction labor market, in partneship with eNpower.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website in English\nOfficial website in Portuguese\nOfficial website of the Religion of the God, the Christ and the Holy Spirit in Portuguese",
