        "content": "The Malaga Marathon (Spanish: Maratón Málaga: 1  or Maratón de Málaga: 1 ) is an annual road-based marathon hosted by Málaga, Spain, since 2010.  The marathon is a World Athletics Label Road Race, and was a member of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS).\nA half marathon is also held on the same day.: 2   The Malaga Half Marathon is a different race, generally held earlier in the year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe inaugural event was held on 6 December 2010 as the \"Maratón de Málaga\".  Organized by the Málaga City Council, the marathon was won by Spanish runners Juan Vázquez Sánchez and Blanca María Serrano, with finish times of 2:27:29 and 2:59:16, respectively.  Sánchez won the race by over seven minutes.  Swedish runner Sandr Halvarsson crossed the finish line before Serrano, but was disqualified for lack of evidence proving that she covered the whole course.  Roughly 2,000 runners participated in the marathon.  A disturbed man, who was tripping some of the participants, was quickly arrested.  The marathon was held in conjunction with a 12 km (7.5 mi) race that used the first 12 km of the same course.  The shorter race had 680 finishers.\nThe 2016 edition of the race was cancelled on the day of the race due to inclement weather.\nThe 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of transferring their entry to 2021, or obtaining a refund (minus management fees).\nIn 2023, Spanish runner Ricardo Rosado sacrificed what would have been a fifth-place finish to help a fellow runner who was struggling to complete the race.  Although Rosado's act violated the rules of World Athletics, the marathon organizers stated that they would not disqualify Rosado, and also awarded him the 500 EUR that he would have earned had he finished fifth.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe marathon is run on a loop course that begins and ends on the Paseo del Parque in Málaga Park, in front of Málaga City Hall.: 5–6   The first and last stretches are run on the same section of the Paseo del Parque, but in different directions.: 5–6   The half marathon shares the same start line as the marathon, but finishes nearby instead, outside the park.: 5–6 \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

Next to Granda's statue is an equestrian statue of José Antonio de Lavalle y García, the subject of Granda's song José Antonio.\n\n\n== History ==\nGranda lived part of her childhood on a ranch at the Bajada de los Baños in the district of Barranco until she was twelve years old, near the Bridge of Sighs, to which in 1960 she dedicated a song of the same name.\nAs a result of this tribute to a major landmark of the district, the municipality decided to erect a sculpture in gratitude to her. The monument, a stone work by Fausto Jaulis, an artist from Ayacucho, was inaugurated on October 24, 1992, in the Plazuela Chabuca Granda, next to the Bridge of Sighs. Next to it stands the monument to the José Antonio de Lavalle y García, to whom Chabuca dedicated the song José Antonio.\nIn Santiago de Chile, a replica of the statue was unveiled in 2015.\nIn 2021, Lavalle's statue was vandalised, with its head removed. It was quickly restored to its original state and an investigation was launched.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBridge of Sighs (Lima)\nHermitage of Barranco\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lord of Kinfauns is a title of nobility in the Baronage of Scotland.\nThe lordship was created in the genus of barony in 1487 in the reign of James III of Scotland for William Chateris, 1st Lord of Kinfauns. As recorded in the Great Seal, Scotland's oldest national record, in a charter \"in domino de Kynfawnis\" (in the Lordship of Kinfauns).\nMinor barons, barones minores, are the lowest rank of the aristocracy, but they are an ancient rank, for barons existed before Scotland had dukes, marquesses, viscounts or baronets (bearing in mind that in pre-Union 1707 Scotland the equivalent to the English rank of Baron was Lord of Parliament, and that it is a solecism to style Lords as Barons).\nThe lordship represents the second highest degree of Scottish feudal nobility. Also held in baroneum, there are only, perhaps, two dozen examples extant today, making this title very rare.\n\n\n== Lord of Kinfauns (1487) ==\nBaronial titles tend to be used when a landed family holds no peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, nor has been created a knight of the realm.

Kinfauns likely takes its name from the Gaelic ceann-fan or ceann-fauns, meaning either the 'head of the slope', referring to the rising Sidlaw Hills, or 'head of the opening', referring to the belt of flat land beside the hills, opening eastward into the Carse of Gowrie. Kinfauns Castle, which sits between Kinfauns village and Perth, was built in the early 1820s in a Gothic fashion, replacing a medieval castle which had previously stood on or near the site.\n\nHistorically, the Lords of Kinfauns held the power of admiralty over the Tay. They were tasked with preserving the fishing in the river and with punishing poachers. Tradition has it that all vessels sailing along the river once recognised the power of the Lord of Kinfauns by saluting the castle or by lowering their colours as they passed it.\n\n\n== History of the Lordship of Kinfauns ==\nRecords in the 1170s show that a chapel of Kinfauns, among others, was confirmed in the possession of the nearby Scone Abbey, one of the great religious establishments of medieval Scotland. Legend has it that some lands of Kinfauns passed around 1330 to a Frenchman, Thomas de Longueville. De Longueville was supposedly of noble stock but had been forced into exile after committing murder in the presence of the King of France. He adopted a life of piracy, sailing the seas for 16 years and earning the name \"Red Reiver\". It is said he attempted to capture a ship carrying Sir William Wallace who defeated De Longueville. The Reiver in turn became Wallace's companion, joining him in his struggle against the English during the Wars of Independence. There is a cave called the Dragon Hole in Kinnoull Hill in the parish of Kinfauns which is believed to have been an occasional hiding place of Wallace. De Longueville later joined King Robert the Bruce and is said to have been alongside him in the vanguard of the capture of the key stronghold of Perth in 1313. As a reward for his bravery Bruce granted him lands at Kinfauns. De Longueville was considered a great warrior and supposedly wielded a two-handed broadsword nearly six feet long. Some say he married the heiress of Charteris of Kinfauns and took from her the name Chartres or Charteris, and built a castle. Certainly, he adopted this name and his descendants held land at Kinfauns in the following centuries.\nIt seems that lands of Kinfauns were divided by the time of King Robert the Bruce, who also granted lands to the De Maneris and the Ross families. In 1426 the Abbot of Scone brought a dispute before Parliament against Robert de Ross and Thomas Charteris. The Abbot claimed that the teinds (tithes) due to him from the lands of Kinfauns had not been paid for some time. Parliament confirmed his rights and ordered the landowners to pay amends.\nThe town of Perth was one of the most important fortifications in late medieval Scotland. It was surrounded by castles and powerful families, who were often at war with one another and with the magistrates of Perth. Along with the Charteris family of Kinfauns there were also the Ruthvens, Blairs, Oliphants, Rosses and more. The Charteris family had a bitter and long-running feud with the Ruthvens, and in 1552 John Charteris was murdered by the Ruthvens on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Another feud was between the Charteris of Kinfauns and their neighbours, the Blairs of Balthyock. Many of the Charteris family rose to prominence in the governance of Perth town from the late 14th to the mid 16th century. For example, between 1465 and 1500 Andrew Charteris was Provost of Perth fourteen times and between 1480 and 1500 Gilbert Charteris was eight times elected bailie. During the struggles of the mid 16th century the Charteris family were supporters of the Queen Dowager, Cardinal Beaton and the Regent Arran.\nThe last Charteris of Kinfauns was John Charteris, who with his wife Janet Chisholm adopted as their son Harry Lindsay, brother of David Lindsay, the Earl of Crawford. Harry took the surname Charteris and in time acquired the lands and Lordship of Kinfauns. He later succeeded his brother as Earl of Crawford. Some say he married Beatrix Charteris, an heiress of Kinfauns.\nIn 1581 King James VI granted to the powerful William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie, Lord Ruthven, Dirleton some lands at Kinfauns. William was succeeded by his son John, 3rd Earl of Gowrie. There are many theories as to the motives of the mysterious Gowrie Conspiracy in 1600, but Gowrie and his brother Alexander seem to have tried to kill or kidnap King James VI; but were both killed in the attack. As a result, John's lands and titles were forfeited to the Crown. As with many lands from the Earls of Gowrie, their part of the lands of Kinfauns were granted to one the king's favourites, Sir David Murray, Lord Scone.\n\n\n=== 17th century onwards ===\nBy the 1620s the lands and Lordship of Kinfauns were in the hands of George Hay. Hay was the second son of Patrick Hay of Megginch, and a favourite of King James VI, who bestowed on him the lands of the Carthusian monastery at Perth along with a seat in Parliament in 1598. He was with the king during the events of the Gowrie Conspiracy, and was rewarded for his loyalty. In 1616 he was appointed Lord Clerk Register and knighted. In 1622 he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland, one of the great offices of state, and in 1627 he was created a peer as Viscount Dupplin and Lord Hay of Kinfauns. In 1633 he was created Earl of Kinnoull. He died in 1634 and was interred in Kinnoull Church, where a statue was erected of him in his Lord Chancellor's robes. His only surviving son succeeded him as the 2nd Earl of Kinnoul in 1634. He was a yeoman of the guard to King Charles I and one of his privy councillors. In 1641 there was a ratification in favour of Hay, of his infeftment of the Lordship of Kinfauns, including the responsibility for the keeping of the waters of the Tay. His son William succeeded as 3rd Earl of Kinnoul. For his continued support of the king, he was imprisoned by the English in Edinburgh Castle during the tumultuous civil wars of the mid-17th century. The Hay family's loyalty to the Stuart monarchy caused them to lose the greater part of their estates around this time.\nIn 1647 the lands and Lordship of Kinfauns passed to Thomas Blair of Balthyock, a descendant of the Blairs who had been neighbours and great rivals to the Charteris family. Around 1660 Sir Alexander Blair of Balthyock sold to William Blair the lands and Lordship of Kinfauns and Craigtoun, including the keeping of the waters of the Tay. In 1671 Alexander Carnegie, son of the Earl of Northesk, married Ann, the eldest daughter of William Blair of Kinfauns, who resigned the Lordship of Kinfauns to his daughter and her husband. Their son, Alexander, assumed the name of Blair as well as that of Carnegie. In 1685 Alexander Blair Carnegie, younger of Kinfauns, was appointed by Parliament a commissioner for the Act of Supply. In 1695 Alexander Blair Carnegie of Kinfauns succeeded to the lands and Lordship of Kinfauns.\nThe Blairs held Kinfauns into the early 18th century, when Margaret, daughter of Alexander Blair and Jean Carnegie and heiress of the Blairs of Kinfauns married John, 11th Lord Gray, and so the Kinfauns estate passed to the Gray family. The 11th Lord Gray was Sheriff Principal of Forfarshire and Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire. It is said that during the Jacobite Rising of '45 Gray waited on the Hanoverian commander the Duke of Cumberland at Dundee as the Duke was on his way to the Battle of Culloden. Apparently, the Duke received him coldly and haughtily and Lord Gray immediately returned home and resolved to join the Rising and Bonnie Prince Charlie. His wife, who could see the dim prospects of the Rising, prevented her husband from leaving through trickery, knowing he would not listen to reason. She recommended that he should have his feet bathed after his hard ride from Dundee. His lordship put his feet into the bath and Lady Gray, as if by accident, poured a kettle of boiling water upon them. He was so scalded that he was unable to leave his room for several weeks, and meanwhile the rising had come to a bloody end.\nKinfauns remained with the Gray family. Francis, 14th Lord Gray of Gray and Kinfauns, succeeded his brother in 1807 and held the titles and estates for many years. He had been a Major in the Breadalbane Fencibles and was later Postmaster-General of Scotland and served as a representative peer for Scotland in the House of Lords from 1812 to 1842. He is said to have been a popular and respected local figure who did much to improve the neighbourhood, as he did to improve his own estates. This Lord built the new mansion house of Kinfauns in the 1820s and vastly improved the estate by building new farmsteads and cottages of artistic design. He was succeeded by his son John, 15th Lord Gray, who was also a Representative Peer for Scotland and Deputy-Lieutenant of Perthshire. During the construction of the Dundee and Perth Railway it is said that Lord Gray would only allow the line to pass through his estate for the then huge fee of £12,000.\nThe estates of Gray and Kinfauns passed to a cousin of the Grays, Edmund Archibald Stuart, who took the surname Gray. He later succeeded another kinsman to become the 15th Earl of Moray in 1895. The Earl was succeeded by his brother Francis James Stuart, 16th Earl of Moray and he in turn by his brother Morton Gray Stuart-Gray, 17th Earl of Moray in 1909. The 17th Earl was an enthusiastic gardener and was responsible for improving the gardens at Kinfauns.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nScottish Law Commission. \"Report on Abolition of the Feudal System.

But because no candidate received a majority of the popular vote, a separate election was held by the New Hampshire General Court, which chose Anti-Federalist candidate Josiah Bartlett as the winner, despite Bartlett having only received 21.59% of the vote and having placed third.

        "content": "The S48 and S98 constitutes two bus routes in Staten Island, New York, running primarily on Victory Boulevard and Forest Avenue, between St. George Ferry Terminal and Arlington. It is operated by the New York City Transit Authority.\nThe S48 was originally the R107 bus route, and was renumbered to S107, then the S48 in 1989. The S98 was created in 1995 as a limited stop variant of the S48.\n\n\n== Route description and service ==\n\nThe S48 begins at the St. George Ferry Terminal at Ramp C, and continues along Bay Street until it goes on Victory Boulevard. It goes on the boulevard for a length until it turns to Forest Avenue. It then continues on Forest Avenue until it turns to South Street, and uses Arlington Place to access the terminus. Buses heading eastbound use Holland Avenue and Richmond Terrance to access South Avenue. Some buses terminate or start at  Richmond Avenue during rush hours in the peak direction.\nDuring rush hours, the S98 replicates the S48, running to St. George Ferry Terminal during AM rush hours and Arlington during PM rush hours. Buses make all local stops west of Richmond Avenue.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe S48 was originally the R107 route, which ran between St. George Ferry Ramp \"C\", and Mariner's Harbor or Port Ivory. It was initially operated by the Staten Island Coach Company, then the Isle Transportation Company. In 1947, Isle Transportation went bankrupt, and the New York City Board of Transportation took over its routes, including the R107, on February 23rd of the same year. The R107 was renumbered the S107, then the S48 on April 2, 1989. On that date, the hours of service to Holland Avenue and Richmond Terrace were extended, with some trips now running to Howland Hook to serve works in Port Ivory, taking over the western terminal of the S1, then renumbered the S40.On March 15, 1995, NYCT announced plans to truncate service from Howland Hook to Arlington Place and South Avenue in Mariners Harbor.On the same day, the S98 service began as a limited stop variant of the S48. Service to St. George initially ran between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and service from St. George initially ran between 5:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.. S98 trips were implemented by converting some existing local trips to provide passengers traveling longer distances with quicker trips to and from St. George.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

From 1990 to 1992 baited traps were used of Taiwan at depths of 300 to 500 metres (980 to 1,640 ft) where seven collections of the isopods were made. Individuals measured from 28 to 138 millimetres (1.1 to 5.4 in) in length and varied on the season. Males were usually at lengths of 50 millimetres (2.0 in) whereas females usually measured at 88 millimetres (3.5 in).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Samuel Solly  (13 May 1805 – 24 September 1871) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSilly was the son of Isaac Solly, a Baltic merchant. He was born on 13 May 1805 in Jeffrey Square, St. Mary Axe. Solly was educated under Eliezer Cogan of Higham Hill, Walthamstow, where Benjamin Disraeli, Dr. Renn Hampden, afterwards bishop of Hereford, and Russell Gurney, were among his schoolfellows. He was articled, somewhat against the wish of his father, in May 1822, to Benjamin Travers, surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, and he was one of the last of the surgeons to a London hospital who succeeded to his post by the payment of a large apprenticeship fee. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 9 May 1828, and he then went to Paris to continue his medical studies. He commenced practice in his father's premises at St. Mary Axe in 1831, moving to St. Helen's in 1837, to Aston Key's house, on the death of that surgeon, in 1849, and afterwards to Savile Row. From 1833 to 1839 he was lecturer on anatomy and physiology in the medical school of St. Thomas's Hospital. He was appointed assistant-surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital in 1841; twelve years later he became full surgeon, and was appointed lecturer on surgery. He was called upon to resign the office of surgeon in 1865, under a new rule which required the medical officers to retire at the age of sixty. He pleaded that the rule was not retrospective, and was reappointed till he should have completed his term of twenty years as full surgeon. His health gave way, however, and he resigned before the expiration of his term of office. Elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1843, he became a member of its council in 1856, and was twice a vice-president. He was elected a member of the court of examiners in 1867, and held the post of Arris and Gale professor of human anatomy and surgery in 1862. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1867–8, and became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1836. He died suddenly at 6 Savile Row on 24 September 1871, and was buried at Chislehurst, Kent.\nHe married, on 22 May 1834, Jane, daughter of the Rev. Joseph Barrett, and by her had seven sons and four daughters.\nSolly was a skilful operator, a florid lecturer, and a good clinical teacher; his opinion was specially sought in cases of injuries to the head and in diseases of the joints. He had a taste for art, and was skilful in the use of brush and pencil; his watercolour pictures more than once adorned the walls of the Royal Academy (Graves, Dict. of Artists, p. 220). He made his own lecture illustrations, many of which were purchased by the authorities of St. Thomas's Hospital in 1841.\nAfter his death a marble bust was presented to St. Thomas's Hospital, and a Solly prize and medal in the medical school was established from the proceeds of a public subscription in his memory.\nHe wrote: \n\n‘The Human Brain … illustrated by references to the Nervous System in the Lower Orders of Animals,’ London, 8vo, 1836. The work is dedicated to Benjamin Travers, and is illustrated by twelve well-executed lithographic plates. A second edition, in which the plates are replaced by figures in the text, was issued in 1847.\n‘Surgical Experiences,’ London, 8vo, 1865; containing the embodiment of his teaching as lecturer on surgery at St. Thomas's Hospital.\n‘An Analysis of Johan Müller's “Intimate Structure of Secreting Glands,”’ London, 8vo, 1839; dedicated to Sir Astley Cooper, bart. He also contributed papers to medical periodicals and to the ‘Transactions’ of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Solly, Samuel\".

A wing was added to the north in the Victorian period, but was later demolished.  The building was Grade II* listed in 1952.  It was put up for sale in 1999 for £950,000, at which time, it had seven bedrooms, five reception rooms, four bathrooms and two kitchens, with a tennis court in the grounds.\nThe three-storey house is built of red brick, with stone dressings, quoins, and a Welsh slate roof.  There are twin gables on the front and rear, and a full-height gabled bay projecting from the centre on three sides.  On the west side is a three-storey canted bay window with an embattled parapet.  The windows are mullioned and transomed.\nInside the house are several fittings brought from elsewhere: a late medieval fireplace, a Jacobean staircase from Lymore, and panelling from various locations, most notably Ashley Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==",

As kgosi, Maleke led an attack against a Bangwaketse village in Kanye to avenge the death of his father. He burned the village, and he is said to have killed Tawana, the uncle of the village's leader, Makaba. A short time later, Maleke died of rabies after he was bitten by a dog.

        "content": "The Hermitage of Barranco (Spanish: Ermita de Barranco), formerly known as the Templo de la Santísima Cruz and later as Santísima Cruz de Barranco, is a Catholic church building in Barranco District, Lima, Peru. It is located in the district's historic centre and once served as the district's capital and cathedral, next to the Bridge of Sighs, and has been closed since 1974 due to the damages caused by that year's earthquake.\nThe Plazuela Chabuca Granda, named after the Peruvian singer who dedicated a song to the bridge, serves as the main public area outside the church and features two statues by sculptor Fausto Jaulis dedicated to Granda and José Antonio de Lavalle y García, the subject of another song of hers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe location of the church is traditionally considered the origin of the district, with an 18th-century legend claiming that two Indian fishermen who had become lost at sea managed to find their way to the shore through a light cast by a cross located there.\nThe church was built in the mid-18th century as a small chapel where humble fishermen and travelers attended mass, financed by a Mr. Caicedo, a baker and devout Catholic. Caicedo died at the end of the century, leaving the project incomplete, which was finished with the name of Templo de la Santísima Cruz in honour of the fishermen's miracle.\nIn 1874, it was chosen as the centre and capital of the town of San José de Surco, created by Manuel Pardo y Lavalle on October 26, with the neighbourhoods of Talana, Condesa, Ollería, Tejada, Larrión and Pacayar under its jurisdiction, bordered to the north by the Quebrada honda de Armendáriz and the chacra del Cuadrado to the south.\nOn January 14, 1881, the unfinished church was looted and destroyed by a fire, both perpetrated by the Chilean Army, during the War of the Pacific, it was rebuilt in 1882 through funds acquired by Chaplain Manuel de la Fuente Chávez from local donations and some funds from Patricio Lynch.\nOn December 12, 1903, the archbishop of Lima accepted the district's 1900 request that the church be elevated to a parish, independent from Surco and Chorrillos, with the temple now known as the Santísima Cruz de Barranco and under the direction of de la Fuente (1903–1913, died in office). After de la Fuente's death, he was succeeded by the Spaniard Santiago Roca (1914–1937).\nThe church was damaged during the 1940 Lima earthquake, leading to a request being made to the archbishop, requesting his authorisation to build a new church, which was granted in 1942 and consecrated by Juan Landázuri Ricketts in 1963. The original church was declared a historic monument subject to the care of the National Conservation Council, and renovated in 1960 by th pro-restoration committee established by architect Alberto Aranzaens in 1957. In was subsequently declared part of the cultural heritage of Peru in 1972, through Supreme Resolution 2972-ED.\nIt was again damaged during the 1974 Lima earthquake and has since been closed to the public.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBridge of Sighs (Lima)\n1974 Lima earthquake\nChabuca Granda\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edmund Sigismund Somers  (1759? – 1824) was an Irish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSomers was born in Dublin about 1759, was the son of William Somers, a mechanic. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 June 1779, and afterwards studied medicine at Edinburgh University, where he graduated M.D. on 12 Sept. 1783. After visiting the medical schools of Paris and Leyden he returned to Dublin, and was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1791, and began to practise in London. On 18 March 1795 he was appointed physician to the forces. In this capacity he proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope as director of hospitals. After several years he retired to England, served in the home district, and then went as staff physician to Jamaica. After two years he returned to England in ill health, and on recovery joined the army in the Peninsula, where the Marquis of Wellington in 1812 appointed him physician in chief to the allied forces. On 18 January 1816 he was nominated a deputy medical inspector, and retired on half pay. He died in London in 1824.\nSomers was the author of: \n\n‘Dissertatio Physico-medica Inauguralis de Sonis et Auditu,’ Edinburgh, 1783, 8vo.\n‘Medical Suggestions for the Treatment of Dysentery and Fever among Troops in the Field,’ London, 1816, 8vo (published in both Latin and English).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1898). \"Somers, Edmund Sigismund\".

        "content": "Stepan Demyanovich Kovnir, (Ukrainian: [/kovːˈnir stɛːˈpɔn dɛmːˈjanːoːˌvɪtʃ/] Ковнір Степан Дем'янович; Russian: Ковнир Степан Демьянович; 1695–1786) was a Ukrainian builder and master mason in Kyiv. His nearly sixty years of labor brought aesthetic unity to the ancient, sprawling center of Ukrainian culture and education, the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A serf without any formal education, he became an early master of Ukrainian baroque architecture as well as organizing a school for masons.\n\n\n== Birth and background ==\nStepan Kovnir was born in 1695 in Hvozdiv, a village on Ros River south of Kyiv, owned by St. Michael's Hermitage, a wealthy monastery in the Kyivskoi subdistrict of the Kyivskoho administrative district under Cossack Bohdan Khmelnytsky's hetman state. Today the village is in the Feodosiivska rural hromada of the Obukhiv Raion in Kyiv Oblast. The family he was born into were poor peasants who had come there after the destruction of Hvozdiv which had completely depopulated the village.  Though they were peasants they were not serfs. This meant he was not bound to the hermitage and thus, after his family had died, he was able to travel to Kyiv in 1718.\n\n\n== Kovnir, the builder ==\n\nKyiv Pechersk monastery, one of the primary centers of eastern Slavic religion and culture for centuries,  suffered a devastating fire on April 22, 1718 which destroyed most of the buildings in the monastic compound. Rebuilding did not begin until 1721. For some unknown reason Kovnir entered into serfdom under that very wealthy Lavra and served it for nearly the next six decades. Monastic duties were not required of him however. Instead he joined brick masons H. Teslenko and  Iosyf Rubashevsky and engineers S. Chelakayev and N. Vladimirov in the rebuilding efforts. He learned the trade under his first teacher, Moscow architect Ivan Kalandin, beginning with humble projects: warehouses, storerooms, a bakery and a locksmith's shop. Over the succeeding decades he would work and rework these buildings following repeated fires from 1727 to 1773, incorporating folk motifs into the structure and stucco facings.\nEventually the largest one came to be called Kovnir's Building in honor of his efforts there to develop the Ukrainian baroque architectural style that celebrates the region's ancient, distinct culture. That building, built immediately northeast of the monastery's cathedral, began as a bakery and Kovnir festooned its gables with lush swags of botanical motifs. Later, a print shop was added to the north side of the bakery. Kovnir relied more on classic columns and far less on plant elements in the gables of this extension. But he gave the assemblage a unified facade that makes it appear as a single building with six gables.  In 1729 he collaborated with Yuriy Belinsky to create the volutes, pediments and gold disks for the roof of the Lavra's Assumption Cathedral. Unfortunately, this cathedral was reduced to rubble either by the German army or by retreating Soviets during World War II and the restored pediments are not faithful reproductions.\nKovnir deepened his skills from 1741 to 1745 when Gottfried Johann Schädel consulted with him to replace the Lavra's old, wooden bell tower with the Great Bell Tower, built of brick, stucco and ceramic in a classical style. The top three tiers of the 4-story structure have Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, successively. The capitals of the columns are cast ceramic and no two of the Corinthian capitals, with their lush acanthus leaves, are alike. In contributing to all of this, Kovnir was developing a very high level of ability. In 1749 he participated in the construction of St. Andrew's church, Kyiv, working under Ivan Michurin on a European baroque design by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli.  In subsequent decades, he would also work with engineers Daniel de Bosquet, S. Chelakayev and N. Vladimirov, and architects Pyotr Neelov, F. Vasiliev and Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi.\nKovnir's career moved from strength to strength as his name became widely known. From 1754 to 1761 he fulfilled his dream to supervise construction of a sobor and belfry in the town of Vasylkiv, just a few miles from the village of his birth: the Church of St. Anthony and St. Theodosius. With its curved, tipped gables and molded, square Corinthian half-columns supporting a double cornice under its roof, it resembles the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin in Kozelets. The Kozelets cathedral was built in the Chernihiv region during the same period this Vasylkiv sobor was built in the Kyiv region and Hryhorovych-Barskyi was the cathedral's architect. However, the Vasylkiv church forgoes the cathedral's roman mock pediments above each window in favor of curving volute ornaments. Its ground floor windows are larger and the church's overall proportions are more harmonious. It bears a memorial plaque expressing the gratitude of the community for the building of the church.\nIn 1755 Kovnir finished Klov Palace, a hostelry intended for noble and royal guests of Pechersk Lavra and which had been begun by Neelov. For this he was released from serfdom, became a master mason, was made a burgher and given a manor south of Pechersk, in what is now the Holosiivskyi district. This allowed him to enter into a contract on his own behalf with Manasiy Maksymovich, the rector of Podil's Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and archimandrite of its neighboring Kyiv Bratsky Monastery, to erect the bell tower of that monastery in 1756. The tower was square, three stories high and topped with a baroque dome and cross. Its style, visible in architectural plans still in existence, indicates the architect could have been Hryhorovych-Barsky. The delineation between the stories was subtle and the bottom story was an arched gateway, flanked with staircases. It dominated Podil's visual landscape as the main gate between the ecclesiastic compound and the area's main market to its west until it burned down in the Great Podil Fire in 1811.\nIn 1757 he built a book bindery south of Kovnir's Building and east of Assumption Cathedral. From 1754 to 1761 Kovnir supervised the building of the bell tower for the Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos in the Far Caves at the Pechersk Lavra, based on sketches by Hryhorovych-Barsky. Built mostly after his release from serfdom, this has been called his masterpiece for the delicate and innovative plaster motifs Kovnir used above the archivolt of the first tier and above the arches of the second. They combine the roses and trefoils of baroque aesthetic with the delicacy of rococo, all while expressing this using motifs from traditional Ukrainian embroidery. Kovnir finished the final major architectural element at the Pechersk Lavra when he erected the bell tower for the Church of the Annunciation at the Near Caves in 1759 to 1763, thus bringing aesthetic unity to the monastic complex. In 1767 he completed building Trinity Church for the hermitage in Kytayiv, ornamented with Ukrainian baroque motifs in stucco. After Charles de Chardone added a second story to the book bindery Kovnir had built in 1757, changing its architectural style to from Ukrainian baroque to renaissance, Kovnir built a second one from 1772 to 1773.\n\n\n== Kovnir, the man ==\n\nKovnir was bound to Kyiv Pechersk Lavra which had great independence from the civil and political control of either Pechersk or Kyiv. There is a story that, having learned that the mayor of Pechersk was selling favors and influence, he executed his own form of swift and decisive justice right where the activity was occurring. The mayor later complained, \"Kovnir threw off his wolfskin coat, grabbed me by the hair, and bending me almost to the ground, punched me mercilessly in the face. If everyone had not dispersed, he would have beaten me even more.\"\nWith his wife Yevdokia Ivanovna, Kovnir was the parent of two sons, Vasyl and Matvyi. His childrens' surname was Kryshtalevsky (Кришталевські) indicating that this was his own surname at birth and it had been changed to Kovnir when he became a serf. The family lived in the Pechersk parish of the Church of the Saviour at Berestove, immediately north of the Lavra and part of its world heritage site. He was a founding patron of that church and his portrait would have been on the wall there, perhaps in fresco. As a patron he engaged in community activities to benefit his parishioners, most of whom were military. The relationships and network he built there are reflected in the fact that his son Vasyl would become a warrant officer in the Kyiv Reiter Command, an exclusive military unit with high social prestige. Literacy was a requirement for membership, indicating that Kovnir had been able to educate his children. The way Vasyl was mentioned in the reiters' muster roll of 1772 indicates that he wasn't from a military, noble, clerical, peasant or laborer family. He was referred to as \"Malorusian,\" the Russian term for Ukrainians, but his social class is not mentioned. Vasyl married Tatyana Efremivna, with whom he had a daughter named Iryna Vasylivna Kryshtalevska. She would go on to marry Serhii Frolovych Zhukov, a lieutenant of the 2nd Battalion. The Zhukovs were a family with a dedades-long tradition of reiter service. Kovnir's other son, Matvyi, married Kateryna Timofievna.\nKovnir had more interests than just building. Lavra architect Z. Valkevich was the landlord of a market in Podil, the commercial hub of the area, and Kovnir rented shops number 56 and 68 from him in the 1760s. He had a third shop in Bellman's Row in addition to a butcher shop. At some point Kovnir also organized a school for masons. At his death in 1786 he owned other property as well. When Vasyl's widow died in 1792, her will left their daughter Iryna the \"Kovnir's courtyard with all the choirs, lying in the Kyiv-Pechersk fortress, not far from the market.\"\n\n\n== Kovnir's memory after his death ==\nDuring the one hundred and sixty-eight years of Russian rule of Ukraine following Kovnir's death, when it suppressed Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and Ukrainian language, culture and identity, he was forgotten. Russian and Soviet authorities did not think Ukrainian baroque architecture was worth remembering, much less preserving. Information about his life was rediscovered by B. A. Krytsky and published in his 1954 Ph.D. thesis, Народные мастера архитектуры XVIII века на Украине: Степан Ковнир: Архитектурно-строительная деятельность (People's masters of architecture in 18th century Ukraine: Stepan Kovnir: Architectural and construction activity).\nKovnir's creations were admired by Merited Architect of Ukraine, Professor Yuri Aseev, who wrote: \"Kovner did for the Lavra what Sansovino did for St. Mark's Square in Venice - he completed the historical process of assembling a harmonious architectural complex.\"\n\nIn Vasylkiv, the exterior wall of the Church of Saint Anthony and St.Theodosius bears a gold-painted plaque that reads,\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKyivan Cave Monastery (Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBerlinskii, Maksim Fedorovich (1826).

        "content": "Maurizio Rava (31 January 1878 – 22 January 1941) was an Italian-Jewish painter, journalist, writer, soldier and politician. He was a general in the Royal Italian Army, and served as the governor of Italian Somaliland from 1 July 1931 to 6 March 1935.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRava's political career began in 1919, when he was co-founder of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (predecessor of the National Fascist Party) in Rome. Previously he was a lieutenant during World War I (where he was wounded in combat), and received the Medal of Military Valor three times (one Silver and two Bronze). After 1920 he began a military career in the fascist militias.\nIn the Italian colonies he became secretary general of the governor's office of Italian Tripolitania with Emilio De Bono in March 1927. He then assumed the governorship of Italian Somaliland from 1931 to 1935. In those years he gave dynamic impetus to agriculture, roads and railways with emphasis on all types of construction in Somalia. In 1933 he promoted the urban remodeling of Mogadishu, which since then began to be called \"the white pearl of the Indian Ocean\" and became populated with a large minority (40% of the total inhabitants) of Italian settlers.\nHe was appointed as Senator of the Kingdom upon his return to Italy in 1936.\nHe became politically marginalized in 1938, after Fascist Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany, due to his Jewish background.\nHe was also a Blackshirt brigadier general of the Royal Italian Army and died in Rome on 22 January 1941, as a result of wounds received in the Battle of Bardia (in Italian Libya) during Operation Compass, the British offensive of the Western Desert campaign.\n\n\n== Works ==\nMaurizio Rava wrote several books, including:\n\nAl lago Tsana (il mar profondo d'Etiopia) (published in 1913).\nl'Eritrea; la nostra colonia primogenita (published in 1923).\nSomalia; Parole ai Coloniali (published in 1935).\nOther minor works are: \"Ingiustizia delle sanzioni: l’Italia stato aggredito\", Rome 1936; \"Il problema della mano d’opera in Somalia\", Rome 1937; \"Ovest etiopico: nei paesi del platino e dell’oro\", Rome 1938; \"Politica sociale verso gli indigeni e modi di collaborazione con essi\", Rome 1938; \"Diario di un secondo viaggio nell’ovest etiopico\", Rome 1939.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of people from Milan\nList of West European Jews\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Julian Adyeri Omalla alias \"Mama Cheers\" (born 1965) is a Ugandan businesswoman and an entrepreneur. She is the founder and managing director of Delight Uganda Limited.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nJulian Omalla was born in 1965 and raised in Uganda. She started her career life as businesswoman and entrepreneur in 1996.\nAlthough she didn't know much about running a business, she initiated her career as an employee under her brothers' supervision while simultaneously accumulating savings to establish herself as a small-scale trader. As a female entrepreneur, she aspired to prove her capability in owning and managing a business. Initially successful, her fortunes took a turn when she extended trust to a new business partner.\nShe traversed long distances on poor roads and dedicating long hours to tending her garden. An unfortunate incident occurred when her business partner absconded with the capital earmarked for stock procurement. Following this setback, she was left with minimal resources—a wheelbarrow for transporting produce to the market and a single red dress. Securing financial support from banks proved challenging due to the lack of collateral, making the task of raising funds for expansion a demanding endeavor. Similar to many women in Uganda, she had to depend on personal savings and reinvest profits into the business to facilitate growth.\nAfter four years, Julian Omalla participated in UNCTAD's entrepreneurship program which help her in formulating and implementing a business expansion strategy such as goal establishment, financial record-keeping, marketing tactics, target setting, and effective task accomplishment.\nIn 2000, she was again equipped by Empretec with the skills to become a successful entrepreneur which helped her to realize that she was born an entrepreneur and It helped her to develop and execute her business growth plan.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nJulian Omalla won a special prize during the seventh edition of UNCTAD's Empretec Women in Business Awards for her dedication to empowering other women through her company.\nIn February 2021, the Ugandan Government awarded Omalla's company, Delight Uganda Limited, with a $4 million grant to construct a fresh juice factory in northern Uganda, and $6 million to procure equipment, with 50 per cent of the funds repayable by her company in 10 years.\nShe also received a fellowship to participate in an executive education programme by the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ivybridge Town Hall is a municipal building at Erme Court in Ivybridge, a town in Devon, in England. It serves as the meeting place of Ivybridge Town Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The old town hall ===\nThe first municipal building in Ivybridge was the old chapel in Chapel Place which was commissioned by the local Methodists and erected on land donated by the lord of the manor, Sir John Rogers, 6th Baronet. It was designed in the Italianate style, built in rubble masonry and was completed in 1812. It was enlarged at the expense of the owner of Stowford Paper Mills, John Allen, in 1860. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing down Chapel Place towards Fore Street. The central bay featured a doorway with a semi-circular fanlight flanked by Doric order columns supporting an open pediment; there was a round headed window on the first floor. The outer bays were fenestrated by tall round headed windows. The gable across the frontage contained a circular plaque, which was inscribed with the year \"A. D. 1860\". After the Methodist congregation moved to a larger church in Fore Street in 1874, the old chapel was used a magistrates' court and then as a town hall. Since 1994, it has served as the Chapel Place Community Centre, which is managed by the Ivybridge Community Association.Following significant population growth, largely associated with the paper industry, a local board of health was established in Ivybridge in 1873. The local board of health was succeeded by Ivybridge Urban District Council in 1894. Although civic leaders used the building for public meetings, it ceased to serve any municipal purpose after the area came under the administration of Plympton St Mary Rural District Council, which was based in Plympton, in 1935.\n\n\n=== The new town hall ===\nAfter the Ivybridge Relief Road was opened in June 1994, the area between the new road and the River Erme, which had been occupied by open fields, became available for development. The newly established Ivybridge Town Council decided to commission a dedicated town hall. The new building was designed in the neoclassical style, built in brick with a stucco finish and was completed in around 1995.The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of eleven bays facing north towards Erme Court. The third bay on the left featured a full height portico, with three round-headed openings on the ground floor, three sash windows on the first floor and a pediment containing a clock in the tympanum. The left hand section of two bays was fenestrated by shop fronts on the ground floor and by cross-windows on the first floor, while the right-hand section of eight bays was fenestrated by shop fronts on the ground floor and by sash windows on the first floor. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor. An extension, which was projected forward and commissioned to accommodate a local business, Ivybridge Bathrooms and Kitchens, was erected at the east end of the complex in around 2007.\n\n\n== References ==",

It united the Centre Agreement (PC), Third Republic Movement (RTR), Christian-Democratic Labour Faction (ChDSP), Party of Fidelity to the Republic (SWR-KSN) (a Confederation of Independent Poland splinter) and Regional Agreement RdR.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe PC-ZP coalition was founded on 19 June 1993 during failed negotiations with the Movement for the Republic (RdR), which later formed its own coalition, the Coalition for the Republic (KdR). The two coalitions competed for the same group of voters, and remained divided largely due to \"personal issues\", such as foreseen allocation of cabinet positions, candidate placement on electoral lists and personal rivalry between PC leader Jarosław Kaczyński and RdR leader Jan Olszewski. It also failed, like KdR, to unite the Polish People's Party – Peasants' Agreement (PSL-PL) under its flag.\nThe coalition ran a similar campaign to that of KdR, being in support of lustration and in opposition to the neocommunist party (Democratic Left Alliance, SLD) and liberal parties (Democratic Union, UD, Liberal Democratic Congress, KLD).\nIn the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the only election the coalition contested in, it registered as a party, and thus only needed 5% of valid votes to pass the electoral threshold (as opposed to 8% needed for registered coalitions), which it failed to cross regardless, gathering only 4.42% of valid votes.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wladimir Klitschko vs. Samuel Peter II was a professional boxing match contested on 11 September 2010, for the IBF, WBO, IBO, and The Ring heavyweight championship.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing his stoppage victory over Eddie Chambers, Wladimir Klitschko called out WBA champion David Haye in April 2010, shortly after Haye had stopped John Ruiz, stating, \"I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye. David, you've bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now's the time to make it happen. On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me. You can't run away from me forever and you need to follow through with this fight if you want to be respected. I'm ready. What're you waiting for?\"  Haye had been in line to face Vitali in summer 2009 before signing to face Wladimir on 20 June, however he pulled out with a back injury and was replaced with Ruslan Chagaev.\nKlitschko and Haye entered into talks again for a September date, As the negotiations continued to move forward, with Wembley Stadium and Stamford Bridge being mentioned possible venues. The IBF set a deadline to end negotiations on 17 May, after which Wladimir would have to face their mandatory challenger Alexander Povetkin. A few days before the deadline, Haye said he was interested in fighting Vitali, rather than Wladimir. \nOn 17 May, the 30-day period of negotiation began for Klitschko to defend his championship against Povetkin. Within this period, discussions to make a fight with Haye were still ongoing. In July 2010, it was confirmed that the bout would be taking place in Frankfurt, with Samuel Peter replacing Povetkin for the scheduled fight as Povetkin failed to show up to the press-conference, deciding to pull out of the fight at the advice of his coach Teddy Atlas who believed Povetkin was not ready to face Klitschko. This was the second time Povetkin had pulled out of a bout with Klitschko as they had been set to fight in December 2008, before he was replaced with Hasim Rahman.\nPeter had previously faced Klitschko in September 2005, before either of them had won a major world title, with Klitschko surviving three knockdowns to take a unanimous decision victory.\n\n\n== The fight ==\nPeter would start the fight aggressively and land a left hook to head in the opening round, although Klitschko would come on strong with a good right hand late. Klitschko stunned Peter in the second with a couple of right-left combinations. Peter focused on trying to duck inside the Klitschko jab, but he champion tied him up whenever he got close.\nKlitschko's jab would continue to land, causing swelling around the right eye of Peter and an uppercut late in the sixth appeared to hurt the challenger. Klitschko would continue to dominate the action until the tenth when an uppercut followed by a left hook sent Peter down, referee Robert Byrd began a count before waving it off.\nAccording to CompuBox Klitschko landed 142 punches with 28% accuracy, against Peter's 35 punches with 18% accuracy.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nKlitschko was next set to fight Derek Chisora on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December after Klitschko tore a muscle in his abdomen. The fight was rescheduled for 30 April 2011. However, on 4 March, it was announced that Klitschko had pulled out of the fight due to not being fully recovered from a torn abdominal muscle. The next day it was announced that the highly anticipated fight against Haye would take place on 2 July 2011.\nPeter would be released from his Top Rank contract soon after. Despite this Peter's manager said they would look to secure other big fights in the division against anyone other than the Klitschko brothers.\n\n\n== Undercard ==\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It was designed to combine the ability to achieve high speeds when attacking a target with the low-speed search and strike capabilities of an attack helicopter. It would have used 4x Rolls-Royce RB.202 wing mounted lift fans with a thrust of 4670 kgf each and 2x Rolls-Royce RB.172 turbofan main engines with a thrust of 2300 (3480) kgf each. The strike version had a crew of two (pilot and radar intercept officer) and could carry a weapon payload of 907kg. The combat radius would be 132 miles (213 km) at a speed of 652mph (1050 km/h).\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 2\nLength: 49 ft (15 m)\nWingspan: 30 ft (9.1 m)\nHeight: 12.6 ft (3.8 m)\nPowerplant: 2 × turbofan engines Rolls Royce RB 172\nPowerplant: 4 × Rolls-Royce RB.202 lift engines\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 690 mph (1,110 km/h, 600 kn)\nCruise speed: 652 mph (1,049 km/h, 567 kn)\nCombat range: 132 mi (212 km, 115 nmi)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tailless aircraft\nList of VTOL aircraft\nList of attack aircraft\nList of fighter aircraft\n\n\n== References ==",

At the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the drivers started 12th and 19th and finished in 11th and 14th. As there was no spare chassis available, Sargeant withdrew from the Australian Grand Prix to allow teammate Albon to use his chassis; Albon had crashed heavily in practice and the team were unable to repair his car. Albon ultimately finished in twelfth.

        "content": "Colored Symmetry is a book by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov and published by Pergamon Press in 1964. The book contains translations of materials originally written in Russian and published between 1951 and 1958. The book was notable because it gave English-language speakers access to new work in the fields of  dichromatic and polychromatic symmetry.\n\n\n== Structure and topics ==\nThe book is divided into two parts. The first part is a translation into English of A.V. Shubnikov's book Symmetry and antisymmetry of finite figures (Russian: Симметрия и антисимметрия конечных фигур) originally published in 1951. As the editor says in his preface, this book rekindled interest in the field of antisymmetry after a break of 20 years.  The book defines symmetry elements, operations and groups; it then introduces the concept of antisymmetry, and derives the full set of dichromatic three-dimensional point groups. A paper entitled Antisymmetry of textures is appended to part 1; it analyzes the antisymmetry of groups containing infinity-fold axes.The second part, entitled Infinite groups of colored symmetry, consists of translations of six papers by N.V. Belov and his co-workers in the new field of polychromatic symmetry. These papers cover the derivation of the 42 magnetic Bravais lattices and the 1651 magnetic space groups, the 46 dichromatic plane groups, mosaics for the 46 dichromatic plane groups, one-dimensional infinite crystallographic groups, polychromatic plane groups, and three-dimensional mosaics with colored symmetry.\n\n\n== Audience ==\nThe book is written for crystallographers, mathematicians and physics researchers who are interested in the application of color symmetry to crystal structure analysis and physics experiments involving magnetic or ferroelectric materials.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book had a mixed reception from reviewers. Allen Nussbaum in American Scientist praised the editor for constructing a consistent story from the original works, but criticised the papers in part two for being difficult to read. G.S. Pawley in a review for Science Progress gave credit to the editor for adding the international notation next to the authors' \"retrograde personal notation\". However, he criticised claims that the book is a \"valuable reference book\" as being \"optimistic\". Martin Buerger in an extensive review for Science also offered both praise and criticism. He stated that previous work in the field by William Barlow and H.J. Woods is not given sufficient credit by the authors and is largely missing from the, otherwise full, bibliography.  He praised Shubnikov's book (part 1) as being \"very clearly written, well illustrated, and easy to understand\", but criticised Belov's papers in part 2 because they \"lack a central unifying theme.\" R.J. Davis in a brief review in Mineralogical Magazine said \"this book is therefore unique in English and forms an essential introduction to modern developments in symmetry theory.\"\n\n\n== Influence ==\nIn later reviews of the literature by R.L.E. Schwarzenberger and by Branko Grünbaum and G.C. Shephard in their book Tilings and patterns the work of the Russian color symmetry school led by A.V. Shubnikov and N.V. Belov was put into its proper historical context. Schwarzenberger, and Grünbaum and Shephard, give credit to Shubnikov and Belov for relaunching the field of color symmetry after the work of Heinrich Heesch and H.J. Woods in the 1930s was largely ignored. However, they criticise Shubnikov and Belov for taking a crystallographic rather than a group-theoretic approach, and for using their own confusing notation rather than adopting the international standard Hermann–Mauguin notation for crystallographic symmetry elements.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Colored Symmetry\". at the Internet Archive",

        "content": "The 2005–06 Swiss 1. Liga was the 74th season of this league and was, at this time, the third tier of the Swiss football league system. The 1. Liga was the highest level of amateur football, although an ever-increasing number of teams had professional or semi-professional players in their ranks, this also included the U-21 teams, the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere were 48 teams in this division this season, including eight U-21 teams which were the eldest youth teams of the professional clubs in the Super League and the Challenge League. The 1. Liga was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. The three groups winners and three runners-up, together with the two best third placed teams, then contested a play-off for the two promotion slots. The U-21 teams were not eligible for promotion and could not compete the play-offs. The two last placed teams in each group were relegated to the 2. Liga Interregional.\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\nLast season's group winners Lausanne-Sport had achieved promotion to the second tier. Further, ES FC Malley and Stade Lausanne Ouchy had been relegated and were no longer represented in this division. New clubs in this season were Signal FC Bernex-Confignon and SC Düdingen who had both been promoted after winning their 2. Liga Interregional groups. FC Bulle joined the group after being relegated following the 2004–05 Challenge League season. Also new to the group was Servette. During February 2005, the parent company of the club was declared bankrupt and as a consequence their U-21 team took over the club name playing two divisions below the original Servette team.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\nLast season's bottom two clubs FC Alle and FC Langenthal had suffered relegation. They were replaced by FC Kickers Luzern and SV Muttenz who had both been promoted after winning their 2. Liga Interregional groups respectively. FC Laufen were also promoted after being the best second placed team. Last season's group champions FC Biel-Bienne had missed promotion and remained in the group.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\nLast season's bottom two clubs FC Chur 97 and FC Gossau had suffered relegation. Last season's group winners FC Tuggen had missed promotion and remained in the group. However runner's-up Locarno had achieved promotion, winning the play-offs. Theses teams were replaced by FC Rapperswil-Jona who had been promoted after winning the 2. Liga Interregional group 5 the previous season. Further new to this group were SC Cham and Zug 94 who had played the previous season in group two.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\n\n\n=== Qualification round ===\n  Servette win 6–1 on aggregate\n  Delémont win 7–0 on aggregate\n  Étoile Carouge win 4–2 on aggregate\n 3–3 on aggregate UGS win on away goals\n\n\n=== Final round ===\n  Delémont win 2–1 on aggregate and are promoted to the 2006–07 Challenge League.\n  Servette win 5–1 on aggregate and are promoted to the 2006–07 Challenge League.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nGroup 1 champions were Servette, who also achieved promotion in the play-off finals. Runners-up in this group were UGS, who missed their promotion attempt, being defeated by Servette in this play-off final. Group 2 champions were Biel-Bienne and runners-up were Delémont, who had been relegated two season before. Biel-Bienne failed in their promotion attempt, but Delémont achieved promotion winning against group 1 third placed team Étoile Carouge in the finals. In group 3 champions Tuggen, runners-up Red Star and third placed Herisau all failed in the play-off qualification. From group 1 Signal FC Bernex-Confignon and Grand-Lancy FC were relegated. From group 2 FC Schötz and SC Buochs and from group 3 FC Altstetten and FC Frauenfeld also suffered the same fate and continued the next season in the 2. Liga Interregional.\nThe remaining teams in the 1. Liga were to be joined in next season by Sion U-21, FC La Tour/Le Pâquier, FC Mendrisio-Stabio, FC Olten and FC Gossau, all of whom had won their 2. Liga Interregional groups. Winterthur U-21 as best second placed team also achieved promotion.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2005–06 Swiss Super League\n2005–06 Swiss Challenge League\n2005–06 Swiss Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSwitzerland 2005/06 at RSSSF\nSeason 2005–06 at the official website",

        "content": "Maud Maron is a former public defender and is a member of the New York City Community Education Council District 2. She was formerly its president.\nIn 2019, Maron co-founded Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Education NYC (PLACE NYC) to oppose Bill De Blasio's plans to widen access to selective middle and high schools. She co-founded the New York City Chapter of the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism and served as its interim executive director in 2023.\nShe has run unsuccessfully for the District 1 City Council election and the 10th and New York's 12th congressional districts. Her comments have been criticized as racist and transphobic.\n\n\n== Activism ==\n\n\n=== PLACE NYC ===\nIn 2019, Maron and Yitin Chu formed Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Education NYC (PLACE NYC) to oppose Bill de Blasio's attempts to shift away from screened middle and high schools. Maron served as co-president. PLACE argues that the city's schools are failing their students, that the city should redouble its focus on academics, and that racism does not contribute to the city's underperforming schools. Other parental groups have described it as shifting rightward.\nIn October 2023, Maron stepped down as co-president of PLACE.\n\n\n=== Legal Aid Society ===\nMaron worked as a Senior Staff Attorney for the Legal Aid Society. In July 2020, Maron wrote an opinion piece critical of a NYC DOE anti-bias training session. The Black Attorneys of Legal Aid caucus released a tweet criticizing the piece and stating \"It is obvious to anyone with any sense of racial justice that Maud is racist and openly so\". The Legal Aid Society's official Twitter account retweeted it. Maron sued the LAS, stating her colleagues had unfairly labeled her a racist, but lost the lawsuit.\n\n\n=== Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism ===\nIn 2021, Maron and Yiatin Chu co-founded the New York City Chapter of the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism, which advocates against Critical Race Theory and advocates a \"human first\" mindset critics have likened to \"All Lives Matter\". In 2023 Maron served as interim executive director of FAIR following internal power struggles in the organization.\n\n\n=== Moms for Liberty ===\nMembers of PLACE leadership have promoted local chapters of Moms for Liberty in their private discussion forums and Moms for Liberty has praised PLACE. In January 2024, Maron spoke at a panel organized by Moms for Liberty, who she has described as \"one of the more dynamic and genuinely diverse parents groups to emerge from the school closure era.\" Maron told the New York Daily News she was not a member of Moms for Liberty, and in a statement the organization confirmed Maron was not a member. When speaking to Gay City News, Maron stated \"I am, at this point, a member of Moms for Liberty, yes I am\". The flyer for the event listed her affiliation with the educational council but did not issue a disclaimer that the views expressed were her own. Maron was criticized at a District 2 CEC meeting for her participation in the Thursday panel. At the meeting, she described a protester identifying herself as a \"proud queer woman\" as \"a straight girl without a boyfriend\", drawing criticism.\n\n\n== Political Campaigns ==\n\n\n=== Community Education Council District 2 ===\nFrom 2019 to 2020, Maron was president of the Community Education Council (CEC) for District 2. In 2019, the student organization Teens Take Charge rallied against NYC's segregated school system. The group called on Maron to resign from the CEC following her criticism of the city's proposals for a more culturally diverse curriculum and implicit bias training. At the October 2020 meeting of CEC 2, Maron was removed as President of the council by a vote of 6 - 5. In 2023 Maron was elected to CEC 2 again by a margin of 1/2 vote.\n\n\n=== 2021 District 1 City Council election ===\nIn 2021 she ran in the Democratic primary for the New York City's 1st City Council district with endorsements from the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association and Police Benevolent Association, stating her priorities would be to get schools fully reopened and prevent the opening of a new jail in Chinatown. She stated she favors Kathryn Garcia and Eric Adams for Mayor. The campaign was unsuccessful and she continued to run as an independent. In November, she won 14% of the vote and lost to Christopher Marte.\n\n\n=== 2022 Congressional District elections ===\n\nIn 2022, Maron ran against Carolyn Maloney in the Democratic Primary for New York's 12th Congressional District raising concerns about the inclusion of transgender women in college athletics, stating \"Now, any dude who feels like a woman is supposed to be treated like a woman. That’s absurd\".\nMaron also ran in the Democratic Primary for the 10th Congressional district, calling for revisions to the Biden administration's proposed updates to Title IX and exclusion of transgender people from women's athletics and \"single sex spaces\". Maron stated the policies would one of her top issues if she were elected, arguing that the inclusion of protections for gender identity will do \"real damage to girls and women\". Maron finished last at 2% of the vote.\n\n\n=== Stuyvesant School Leadership Team ===\nSince December 2023, a petition to remove Maron to remove Maron from the School Leadership Team of Stuyvesant High School has gained over 700 signatures. It was circulated after she was quoted in a NY post article calling an anonymous student author a \"coward\" guilty of \"Jew hatred\" and calling for their name to be public for their op-ed.\n\n\n== Views ==\nMaron argues that Critical Race Theory has influenced how teachers educate their students, though CRT is not taught in the city's public schools, and that extended classroom discussions on race are unnecessary.\nMaron has opposed mask mandates in public schools.\nMaron has described city schools as an \"oppressor woke environment where DOE employees make them pledge allegiance to their LGBTQI+ religion.\" Parents and teachers called for her removal from the CEC District 2 board following a story published by The 74 which revealed private texts in which Maron stated \"there is no such thing as trans kids\" and \"the social contagion is undeniable\" when replying to a parent's concerns about the number of LGBTQ+ youth in their child's school. A DOE spokesperson called the comments \"despicable and not in line with our values\". In February, Maron led a resolution urging Eric Adam's education officials to restrict transgender girls’ athletic participation.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMaron was born in Manhattan and lived in Pennsylvania before returning to Manhattan in the 1980s to attend Barnard College. She taught at the Cardozo School of Law from 2003 to 2005.\nMaron is a mother of four. She is married to Juan Pablo and has lived in District 1 for the last 20 years. She is a convert to Judaism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoundation Against Intolerance and Racism\nLGBT grooming conspiracy theory\nMoms for Liberty\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arroz carreteiro (\"wagoner's rice\", in Portuguese) or carreteiro rice is a dish from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul which has become popular throughout Brazil. It is made of a rice base to which shredded or cubed beef is added as well as carne-seca or carne-de-sol, paio, bacon or linguiça, a type of sausage. The dish is traditionally flavoured with garlic, onions, tomato and parsley. In the Central-West Region and the Northeast of Brazil, arroz carreteiro is also known as maria-isabel and it is prepared with carne-de-sol. \n\n\n== Origin and background ==\nThe Portuguese word carreteiro translates to wagon driver. Arroz carreteiro was originally prepared by wagoners who travelled through Rio Grande do Sul on ox carts transporting goods throughout the state. The drivers prepared a simple, practical dish consisting of dried, salted meat mixed with rice. The dish was typically consumed on long solitary journeys, as the cart driver would only have access to freshly cooked meat once he reached a village or settlement after many days on the road. \nWithout refrigeration, the carter was limited to using a dried, salted meat known as carne-de-sol, a type of jerky also known in Rio Grande do Sul as charque. Its shelf stability made it ideal for the extended journeys a carreteiro would undertake. \nThe traditional arroz carreteiro made with charque in a cast iron pot is one of the main dishes of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Modern versions are often made with fresh beef, chopped or minced, or leftover meat from churrasco. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Spacety is a Chinese satellite technology company established in 2016 with a focus on the development, manufacture, and operation of micro/nano-satellites for various applications including earth observation, scientific research, and communication.\n\n\n== History ==\nSpacety was founded in 2016 with the ambition to democratize access to space by providing cost-effective satellite solutions.\nAs of November 2019, Spacety had 70 employees working in Changsha and Beijing, with nine missions and 15 satellites in orbit. By April 2020, Spacety has expanded its satellite constellation to 18 satellites.\nOn December 9, 2023, two of the company's satellites were placed in orbit by the Zhuque-2 rocket, marking the company's 18th mission and bringing the total number of satellites in orbit to 30.\n\n\n== Technology and services ==\nSpacety specializes in the rapid development and deployment of micro and nano-satellites. These satellites support a wide range of applications, from high-resolution earth observation imaging to scientific experiments in space.\nOne of the company's flagship services is its satellite-as-a-service offering, which allows customers to access satellite data without the need for owning and operating their own satellites. This service is designed to lower the barrier to entry for organizations looking to utilize space data for their operations.\nSpacety provides small satellite platforms with masses of 10, 20 to 50 kg, and 200 kg. By 2020, the company has received several rounds of venture capital funding totaling about $36 million. The company aims to provide fast and low-cost satellite services to entrepreneurs and startups worldwide, with a record time of four months and 21 days from signing a customer to launch.\n\n\n== Satellite constellation ==\nSpacety is developing a Laser Communication Aviation Internet Constellation consisting of 288 satellites at an altitude of 1000 km, forming a high-angle low earth orbit constellation with 12 orbital planes, each containing 24 satellites. This constellation aims to achieve 100% global coverage, offering broadband access for flights at any location.\nSpacety is also involved in the Gamma Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) project, an astrophysics constellation of 24 satellites developed in cooperation with the Tsinghua Centre for Astrophysics (THCA). The main scientific objective of GRID is to identify and locate the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave bursts detected by LIGO.\n\n\n== Developments and partnerships ==\nIn September 2019, Spacety set up a subsidiary in Luxembourg to expand its engagement with European firms.\nSpacety has partnered with ThrustMe, a French space propulsion startup, to test light, inexpensive solid ion thrusters for CubeSats and small satellites to provide a measure of maneuverability and address the issue of space debris.\nSpacety collaborated with Hunan University of Science and Technology to develop the Spacety-33 satellite for orbital scientific experiments. Utilizing the RROS, a dual-kernel, real-time operating system crafted in Rust by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, marked the inaugural deployment of a Rust-developed kernel in space applications.\n\n\n== International reception ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nIn February 2023, Spacety was added to a U.S. trade blacklist. U.S. officials alleged that the company had provided satellite images to the Russian paramilitary company Wagner Group.\n\n\n=== Luxembourg ===\nIn March 2023, Luxembourg's economy and foreign ministries filed a case against Spacety's Luxembourg subsidiary, Spacety Luxembourg S.A., for its alleged ties to Moscow.\nFollowing the sanctions, Spacety Luxembourg S.A.'s office contract in Belval was terminated. Several institutions, including the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) and the University of Luxembourg, suspended their collaboration with the company. LIST had been using high-resolution images provided by Spacety for risk reduction, while the university collaborated on mechanical systems for removing space debris.\nSpacety Luxembourg S.A. has denied all allegations regarding its ties to Russia and the provision of satellite images to the Wagner group.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Henry Spencer Smith (12 September 1812 – 29 November 1901) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSmith was born in London on 12 September 1812. He was the younger son of George Spencer Smith, an estate agent, by Martha his wife. After education at Enfield he entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1832, being apprenticed to Frederic Carpenter Skey, with whom he lived, and whose house surgeon he afterwards became. He was admitted M.R.C.S. in 1837, and in 1843 he was chosen one of the 150 persons upon whom the newly established degree of F.R.C.S. England, was conferred without examination; of this band he was the last survivor.\nHe proceeded to Paris in 1837, studying medicine there for six months, and from 1839 to 1841 he studied science in Berlin. On his return to England he was appointed surgeon to the Royal General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street, and he also lectured on surgery at Samuel Lane's school of medicine in Grosvenor Place. When St. Mary's Hospital was founded in 1851 Spencer Smith became senior assistant surgeon. Three years later, when the medical school of St. Mary's Hospital was instituted, he was chosen dean, and filled the office until 1860; for seventeen years he lectured on systematic surgery. He received from both colleagues and students valuable presentations on his resignation. He was member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1867–75), and of the court of examiners (1872–7). He was secretary of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London (1855–88). Caring little for private practice, Smith gave both time and thought to the welfare of the newly founded St. Mary's Hospital and its medical school. He died at his house, 92 Oxford Terrace, W., on 29 November 1901. His library, rich in medical works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as well as in editions of Thomas a Kempis and of Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler, was sold by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge on 14, 15, and 16 Nov. 1878, and on 17 and 18 June 1897. He married (1) Elizabeth Mortlock, daughter of John Sturges, by whom he had a son and a daughter; and (2) Louisa Theophila, daughter of the Rev. Gibson Lucas.\nSmith translated from the German, for the Sydenham Society, Dr. Theodor Schwann's 'Microscopical Researches into the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Animals and Plants' (1847) and Dr. M. J. Schleiden's 'Contributions to Phytogenesis' (in the same volume). These translations gave an impetus in this country to the microscopic study of the tissues.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Smith, Henry Spencer\".

        "content": "The siege of Toron was a military engagement between the armies of the German Crusade and the Ayyubid garrison of Toron. The Crusader army besieged the city from November 1197 to February 1198. The siege ended in failure for the Crusader forces.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTaking advantage of the Ayyubid concentration at Jaffa, king Amalric, with the help of the German Crusaders under Henry of Barbant, launched a campaign to capture Sidon and Beirut. Sidon had already been demolished when the Crusaders arrived there. Sidon was occupied and marched towards Beirut. The governor of Beirut, Usama, seeing no help coming from Al-Adil, decided to destroy the walls and withdraw from the city, thus allowing the Crusaders to capture it.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nEncouraged by their success, the Germans, under Archbishop Conrad, marched towards the castle of Toron and laid siege to it on November 28, 1197. The Crusaders then began undermining the castle walls. Setting fire under the walls made them collapse. Due to this, the Ayyubid garrison offered to surrender by giving up the castle and freeing 500 Christian prisoners lying on the dungeons in exchange for their lives. Conrad, however, demanded unconditional surrender, and the Levantine Crusaders, fearing that a massacre might provoke a Muslim jihad, sent to warn Al-Adil that the Germans wouldn't spare any lives.\nSeeing that negotiations did not lead any results, the Ayyubid garrison took arms and defended the castle vigorously. They managed to destroy the tunnel the Crusaders had built, burning and slaughtering them, with some being dragged outside and beheaded from the walls. The Germans began to grow tired of the siege. Meanwhile, the Germans received news that their emperor, Henry, had passed away, forcing Conrad and his men to raise the siege. On February 2, 1198, an Ayyubid relief army was marching towards Toron and the Germans were prepared to meet them. However, rumors spread that the high-ranking lords had escaped, prompting them to retreat towards Tyre.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThus ended the German Crusade of 1197; it brought nothing to restore German prestige again, but it did help the Levantine Crusaders capture Beirut. Once the Germans went home, King Amalric made a peace treaty with Al-Adil, giving him control of Jaffa while the Crusaders got Beirut. Sidon was divided between Christians and Muslims. Lasting for 5 years and 8 months, proving advantageous to Al-Adil.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSteven Runciman (1954), A History Of The Crusades, Vol. III.

        "content": "La Pampilla is a beach located in Miraflores District, Lima and is part of the Costa Verde beach circuit in Peru. It is used as a surfing area and balneario by the residents of the districts near the beach since the early 1970s. It is considered a cradle of Peruvian surfers.\nIt is protected by the state since April 8, 2016 from Directorial Resolution No. 0220-2016 of the Peruvian Navy, within the framework of the Breakwater Law.\nPollution with solid waste and drainage into the water and on the beach is frequent.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe beach is 350 m long and is covered with pebble stones. The wave break goes to the right and can reach up to 2 m high. The wave is popular all year round for all types of surfers and board sizes: for both newbies and veterans, and from shortboards to longboards.\nNational and international board and padel championships have been held, such as the La Pampilla Longboard Classic, held annually since 2014 or the Campeonato Mundial ISA de StandUp Paddle (SUP) y Paddleboard in 2012 and 2013.\nIn 2017, lights were installed that make it possible to surf the waves at night.\n\n\n=== Conservation status ===\nThe contamination of the waters and shores in La Pampilla with fecal coliforms, construction and domestic waste is frequent due to the poor management of garbage and drainage by some Lima districts such as Villa El Salvador, Magdalena del Mar, Villa María del Triunfo and Chorrillos.\nIn 2015, the Municipality of Lima placed boulders on the beach without authorisation, leading to opposition and their ultimate removal with an apology by then mayor Luis Castañeda.\nThe Peruvian government passed the \"breakwater law\" in 2016 to protect it from infrastructure efforts and other threats.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCosta Verde (Peru)\nMarine pollution\nBeach cleaning\n\n\n== References ==",

He drew most of the illustrations to William Dickinson's ‘Antiquities of Nottinghamshire,’ 1801–6, and the portrait of the author prefixed to that work was engraved from a miniature by him. In 1811 and the following years he published a series of soft ground-etchings from his own watercolour drawings, and those of David Cox, Samuel Prout, Thomas Girtin, and other leading watercolour artists of the day. A series of drawings in watercolour by W. P. Sherlock, representing views in the immediate neighbourhood of London, was preserved in the print-room at the British Museum. They are not only of great historical interest, but also show him to have been an artist of remarkable merit.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cust, Lionel Henry (1897). \"Sherlock, William (fl.1759-1806)\".

Near Keose on the Swordale peninsula are ruins of what Is probably the first post-Reformation church in the parish of Lochs.  \nKeose, Gaelic spelling Ceòs,  is derived from the word \"Hollow\" in Old Norse. \n\nAt the 2011 census, the population of Keose and Keose Glebe  was 106. \n\n\n== References ==",

The hole was forgotten until the son of that fisherman began working with marine academic Juan Carlos Alcérreca-Huerta, who took soundings of its depth and was surprised by the results.\nThe mouth of the hole is nearly circular, with a major axis measuring 151.8 metres (498 ft), oriented about 10.76 degrees clockwise from North -- similarly to the orientation of major faults in the area.\n\n\n== References ==",

Dalian K'un City plays its home matches at the Dalian Football Youth Training Center, located within Ganjingzi District.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded as Liaoning Pilot Free Trade Zone Dalian Area Huayi Football Club (Chinese: 辽宁自贸试验区大连片区华谊足球俱乐部) on 9 May 2022, Dalian Huayi entered the 2022 Chinese Champions League (CMCL) as the winner of the CMCL berth from the qualification route in Dalian. Dalian Huayi were drawn into a group with Changchun Shenhua and Liaoning Leading, a group which Dalian Huayi finished second in, thus qualifying for the knock-outs, where Dalian Huayi faced Dalian Jinshiwan. A 0–0 draw in the first leg and a 1–0 loss in the second leg meant that Dalian Huayi were knocked out of the competition, and the match separated by a Sui Donglu goal marked Dalian Huayi's end for the 2022 season.The club enrolled in the CMCL for the 2023 season again, this time being drawn into group H. After topping their group and winning twice more, Dalian Huayi advanced into the final round, being drawn into group B. Picking up four wins, two draws, and one loss, Dalian Huayi finished third of eight in their group, setting up a knock-out tie with Rizhao Yuqi. Tied at 1–1 in normal time, Dalian Huayi were defeated 3–2 on penalties, eventually finishing the season in seventh overall, missing out on promotion. However, on 6 February 2024, Dalian Huayi were admitted into China League Two, as sufficient teams above them in the Chinese football pyramid have either pulled out or dissolved. In accordance with the Chinese FA's name neutralisation policy, Dalian Huayi changed their name to be Dalian K'un City Football Club on the same day.On the opening day of the 2024 China League Two season on 23 March 2024, Dalian travelled to Langfang Glory City, with the match finishing 1–0 for Dalian K'un City. The goal from Liu Zhizhi secured Dalian K'un City's first ever win in China League Two, the highest level the club has played in thus far.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 14 March 2024Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

In 1759 he was a student in the St. Martin's Lane academy in London, and in that year obtained a premium from the Society of Arts. He at first studied engraving, and was a pupil of J. P. Le Bas at Paris. There he engraved a large plate of ‘The Grange,’ after Jean-Baptiste Pillement, published in 1761; he also engraved the portrait heads for Tobias Smollett's ‘History of England.’ Subsequently, Sherlock took to painting portraits on a small scale, both in oil and watercolours, and miniatures. He was a fellow of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and their director in 1774, exhibiting with them from 1764 to 1777. From 1802 to 1806 he exhibited small portraits at the Royal Academy. He also practised as a picture-cleaner, and was a skilled copyist.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cust, Lionel Henry (1897). \"Sherlock, William (fl.1759-1806)\".

        "content": "Cameron Butler (born June 9, 2002) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger for the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nButler played for the Ottawa Jr. 67s under-14 team from 2014–15 to 2015–16, recording 40 points in 30 games. He attended St. Andrew's College, Aurora, where he played for the hockey team, scoring four points in 2016–17 and one point in 2017–18. He also was a member of the York Simcoe Express U16 team in 2016–17, totaling 21 goals and 21 assists, and in 2017–18, scoring 57 points on 27 goals and 30 assists.\nButler was selected in the second round – 27th overall – by the Peterborough Petes in the 2018 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection. In his first year with the team, he suited up for 66 games and scored 18 goals along with eight assists, for 26 total points. Butler played 39 games with the Petes in the 2019–20 season and scored 12 goals with nine assists before being traded to the Niagara IceDogs, with which he totaled six goals and seven assists while appearing in 27 games.\nButler was eligible for the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, but went unselected. No games were played in the 2020–21 OHL season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He became team captain of the IceDogs in 2021–22 and had 22 points (six goals, 16 assists) in 24 games before being traded in January 2022 to the Oshawa Generals. He finished out the season with them and had five goals and 13 assists in 40 games. Butler returned to the Generals for the 2022–23 season and recorded 55 points (27 goals, 28 assists) in 63 games.\nButler signed an amateur tryout contract (ATO) near the end of the 2022–23 AHL season with the Cleveland Monsters. He appeared in three games that season for the team. On March 16, 2023, he signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played most of the 2023–24 season with the Monsters. \nOn March 30, 2024, Butler was added to the Blue Jackets' roster as an emergency recall. The team's captain, Boone Jenner, had informed them that he was ill shortly before the game and the Blue Jackets had no extra players, \"[b]ut there was a forward [Butler] ... two hours up the road.\" Butler was contacted and told to come as soon as possible. He \"had the good fortune not to get pulled over as he raced\" to the stadium in time for the game, arriving only a few minutes before it started. He ultimately played one shift – 54 seconds – in his NHL debut, a 4–3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. He returned to the Monsters after the game.\n\n\n== International career ==\nButler played for Team Canada White at the 2018 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. He appeared in five games, recording no statistics.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nButler was born on June 9, 2002, in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Consulate General of Sweden, London was the diplomatic mission of Sweden in London between 1859 and 1973. The consulate general originated from the consulate opened in 1722, which was converted into a consulate general in 1850. The tasks of the consulate general included consular services, promotion of trade relations, cultural and political relations, matters concerning the maritime industry, and more.\nThe consulate general's district initially encompassed the United Kingdom and Ireland. The district later comprised United Kingdom and Northern Ireland as well as associated islands. In 1973, the consulate general was merged into the Swedish embassy.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1772, a consulate was established in London with United Kingdom and Ireland as its area of operation. According to King in Council's decision on 18 January 1786, the consul's income consisted of ship tonnage fees based on a tariff, which, according to the National Board of Trade circular on 21 August 1833, was to continue to be applied during the consul's tenure (letters patent of 29 June 1833). The consulate, whose district was to include United Kingdom and Ireland and surrounding islands according to the decision on 1 October 1823, was maintained by letters patent on 25 May 1850, as a consulate general for United Kingdom and Ireland. By letters patent on 14 April 1869, the consul general received a fixed salary (6,000 riksdaler Hamburger banco excluding office expenses), in addition to which the following salaried officials were employed as his assistants:\nVice consul, also secretary (salary 2,500 riksdaler Hamburger banco), clerk, also accountant and registrar (salary 1,500 riksdaler Hamburger banco), two office clerks (salary for each 1,000 riksdaler Hamburger banco). By he consul's tenure (letters patent of 29 June 1833). The consulate, whose district was to include United Kingdom and Ireland and surrounding islands according to the decision on 1 October 1823, was maintained by on 26 October 1877, the district of the consulate general was restricted to England and Ireland, and the salaries were designated in Swedish currency, so that the consul general received 24,000 SEK, the vice consul 10,000 SEK, the clerk 6,000 SEK, and the two office clerks 4,000 SEK each. However, the consul general received a personal salary supplement of 3,000 SEK from 1907 to 1913. The office clerk positions were abolished in 1906, and other salaries were reduced, but they were raised again at the Riksdag of 1910, so that they amounted to 21,000 SEK for the consul general, 9,000 SEK for the vice consul (from 7,200), and 5,500 SEK for the clerk, excluding four age supplements of 300 SEK each (previously 3,600 SEK). In addition, the salary for the second clerk position, established in 1909, was raised from 3,600 to 4,000 SEK in the same year (with age supplements equal to those of the first clerk). The latter salary was further increased to 4,500 SEK in 1913.\nThe consulate general was transferred to the Swedish embassy in 1973. \nThe consulate general remained vacant from July 31 of the same year.\n\n\n== Tasks ==\nThe tasks of the consulate general included handling passport and visa matters, providing information services, and dealing with issues related to the maritime industry, among others.\n\n\n== District ==\nAccording to the decision made on 1 October 1823, the district of the consulate general was to include United Kingdom and Ireland as well as the surrounding islands. At the time of the consulate general's closure in 1973, its district comprised United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, and associated islands.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Chancery ===\nOn 29 September 1910, the chancery of the consulate general moved to 63 Finsbury Pavement in the London Borough of Islington. At the end of September 1919 the chancery moved to 329 High Holborn in Holborn, Central London. It remained there until 1947. In 1948, it moved to 14 Trinity Square, next to Byward Street in the City of London. At the same address, the Swedish Chamber of Commerce for the United Kingdom had been located since 1921.\nIn 1949 the address was 27 Portland Place in the Marylebone district of Central London, the same as the Swedish embassy, but from 1950 the address was again 14 Trinity Square. It remained here until 1969. In 1969 the house was to be sold and the chamber of commerce moved to new modern premises. From 1970 until its closure three years later, the consulate general was located at the same address as the Swedish embassy, at 23 North Row in Mayfair, across the street from Marble Arch.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Residence ===\nFrom at least 1965 to at least 1968, the residence was located at 58 Melton Court.\n\n\n== Heads of Mission ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmbassy of Sweden, London\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Olga von Türk-Rohn, also known by her title through marriage as Baroness von Türk-Rohn and by her maiden name Olga von Rohn (3 June 1865 – 26 February 1940), was an Austrian soprano and voice teacher. She began her career as a concert soprano in 1887 and then worked as an opera singer in Graz from 1888 to 1890. She also sang in one opera with the Vienna State Opera before her marriage to Baron Camillo von Türk in either 1891 or 1897.\nAfter her marriage, Türk-Rohn ceased performing in operas. She was a celebrated concert soprano in Europe from the 1890s into the early 1910s. She drew particular acclaim for her performances in oratorios and German lieder. Türk-Rohn was regarded as a leading interpreter of the works of Franz Schubert, a distinction that was acknowledged through several honors, including the Franz Schubert Silver Medal. Her voice from this period is preserved on several recordings she made in Vienna and in Germany from 1905 to 1907. She also taught on the voice faculties of two music schools in Vienna: the Lutwak-Patonay-Konservatorium and the Neues Wiener Konservatorium.\nIn 1913 Türk-Rohn immigrated with her family to the United States after receiving a contract to perform in operas with a company managed by Oscar Hammerstein I. The planned opera performances never materialized, but Türk-Rohn performed in concerts and recitals in the United States beginning in late 1913. World War I interrupted her performance career. She was living in New York City in 1923 when she relocated to Chicago to join the faculty of Esther Harris's Chicago College of Music. She remained in Chicago for the rest of her professional life, working as a voice teacher both privately and for a variety of different music schools in that city. She ended her teaching career as dean of the vocal department of the The Chicago Conservatory College in the mid-1930s. She was also active as a recitalist, concert and radio singer, and conductor while living in Chicago during the 1920s and 1930s. She moved back to New York City late in her life, dying there in 1940.\n\n\n== Early life and opera career ==\nBorn Olga Carolina Ludovika von Rohn in Vienna on 3 June 1865, Türk-Rohn was the daughter of Robert Freiherr Rohn (also given as Rohnau) and Carolina Anna Tyll. She was encouraged to pursue vocal training and a career as a singer by Mathilde Marchesi who heard her sing at the age of fifteen. Some sources claim her first lessons were with Marchesi at this age, and others that she did not begin her training until later under other teachers.\nTürk-Rohn pursued a singing career against the wishes of her parents. She trained as a soprano  under the instruction of opera singer Ida Liebhardt-Baier in her native city. She began her career on the concert stage in 1887, and in 1888 made her opera debut at the Stadttheater Graz (the predecessor to the Graz Opera). She was a resident artist at that theatre for two years. She starred in Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz at the Vienna State Opera (VSO) in 1888 under conductor Wilhelm Jahn. Despite Jahn's efforts to persuade the directors of the VSO to hire Türk-Rohn for further engagements, she was not offered another contract with the company.\n\n\n== Marriage and career as a concert soprano in Europe ==\n\nOlga retired from the opera stage upon her marriage to Baron Camillo Franz Johann Türk Edler von Karlovacgrad who was State Attorney of Austria at the time of their wedding. Some sources claim their marriage took place in Vienna on October 6, 1891, and others that they were married in 1897. The couple had three daughters together: Elvira, Hertha (sometimes given as Bertha in the American press), and Maude.  The Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon claims that the couple divorced a few years after their marriage and that her husband's year of death is unknown. However, this account is contradicted in Türk-Rohn's 1940 obituary in The New York Times which states the couple were still married when Türk-Rohn moved to the United States in 1913. This publication indicates that the baron lived with his wife and their three daughters in the United States until the baron's death in that country in 1926.\nAfter ceasing opera performance, Türk-Rohn continued to perform as a concert soprano. She studied singing in Vienna with Leo Friedrich and Gustav Walter, focusing particularly on lieder with the latter teacher. Her singing drew the admiration of both composer Johannes Brahms and Austrian music critic Eduard Hanslick whose praise did much to further her career as a concert soprano in Austria during the 1890s. The remainder of her singing career was mainly dedicated to the performance of lieder, oratorio, and other sacred vocal works, and she performed internationally in that repertoire from the 1890s until World War I. In addition to performing lieder by Brahms with the composer's support and attendance, Türk-Rohn's repertoire also encompassed lieder by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Wilhelm Kienzl, Gustav Mahler, and Edvard Grieg among other composers.\nOn 18 April 1895 Türk-Rohn was the soprano soloist in the world premiere of Johann Strauss II's waltz for voice and orchestra Klug Gretelein, Op.462 at the Musikverein. The concert was organized by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Musikverein, and featured conductor Eduard Strauss leading the Strauss Orchestra. The orchestra and Türk-Rohn's performance of the work was heavily applauded at the premiere, and the work was repeated at the audience's behest.\nTürk-Rohn was an early champion of composer Robert Winterberg, and, along with baritone Joseph Schwarz, was one of the soloists in the very first professional concert of his music at Ehrbar Saal (English: Ehrbar Hall) inside the Palais Ehrbar. In 1906 Türk-Rohn and Winterberg were invited to Peleș Castle in Sinaia by Elisabeth of Romania where they gave a concert of Winterberg's music for the queen. She also developed a close working relationship with Czech composer Rudolf Procházka (1864–1936), and performed his Das Glück in concerts in Vienna, Prague and Pilsen.\nIn the early 20th century Türk-Rohn gave concert tours in Austria, Germany, and Italy in which her repertoire consisted of lieder, opera arias, and religious vocal works. She gave performances at the Theater an der Wien in 1896, 1900, and 1903, and performed at the Tyrolean State Theatre in Innsbruck in 1903. In 1910 she sang at the Stadttheater, Hamburg. She also taught singing briefly on the faculty of the Lutwak-Patonay-Konservatorium before joining the voice faculty of the Neues Wiener Konservatorium in 1909.\nTürk-Rohn gained a reputation as one the finest interpreters of lieder written by Schubert. The city of Jablonec nad Nisou completed a monument to Schubert in 1900 which included a statue of Türk-Rohn in which she was depicted as one of the singing muses for the composer. In 1901 she was awarded a gold medal from the Vienna Schubert Society, and in 1912 she was awarded the Franz Shubert Silver Medal by the combined Shubert Singing Societies of Vienna. She was the recipient of honors from Franz Joseph I of Austria, Carol I of Romania, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar, the Shah of Persia. She also was awarded the Salvator gold medal by the city of Vienna in 1901 in recognition of her performances in many concerts for charity in the city. She made several recordings of lieder by Schubert, Brahms, and other composers with various Viennese record labels and the German record label Odeon Records from 1905 to 1907. She also recorded Johann Strauss II's Voices of Spring.\n\n\n== Later life and career in the United States ==\n\nIn 1913 Türk-Rohn immigrated to the United States with her family to join the roster of artists in Oscar Hammerstein I's opera company. The plans for her appearance with the opera company never materialized. She gave a concert at Cooper Union in Lower Manhattan with violinist Alexander Saslavsky and pianist Leopold Rovenger on November 13, 1913. In February 1914 she performed in concert with the French harpist Carlos Salzedo at Brunswick Hall in Brunswick, New Jersey, and the following month performed in a concert of German music sponsored by Wanamaker's at Egyptian Hall, Masonic Temple in Philadelphia. She then embarked on a lengthy concert tour of the United States. This tour was interrupted by World War I, and her performance career mainly ceased. Herman Spielter served as her accompanist during many of her recitals in the United States in 1914.\nTürk-Rohn's daughter, Hertha Türk-Rohn, was also a concert and opera singer. Hertha married Russian-born bass-baritone and voice teacher Reinhold von Warlich in 1923. At the time of their marriage, Olga von Türk-Rohn was living in New York City at 52 W 37th St, New York, NY 10018. Later that year, both she and conductor Ernst Knoch were visiting instructors at Esther Harris's Chicago College of Music (CCM), and it was announced at the end of this visit in December 1923 that Türk-Rohn had joined the voice faculty of Harris's school. A 1926 review of a student recital program stated that the concert included performances from all fifty-five of Türk-Rohn's voice students at the CCM. A 1927 advertisement for the school in The Reform Advocate listed her as the head of the voice program of the CCM.\nBy December 1925, Türk-Rohn was also working as a private voice teacher in Chicago with a studio located at the Congress Plaza Hotel. A June 1928 advertisement for her private studio indicates that it was then located at the Kimball Building (now the Lewis Center at Depaul University). By early 1932 at the latest she had joined the voice faculty of the Bush Conservatory of Music in Chicago. In August 1932 the school merged with The Chicago Conservatory College. She ended her teaching career as the dean of the vocal department of this school in the mid-1930s.\nAfter relocating to Chicago, Türk-Rohn resumed performing on a periodic basis. She gave a recital at Kimball Hall inside the Kimball Building in Chicago on November 13, 1924. By 1925 she had founded her own opera chorus for which she conducted performances from the Drake Hotel for radio broadcasts on WGN (AM) in June, November, and December 1925. In November 1925 she sang in concert with the Gordon String Quartet at Orchestra Hall, Symphony Center, and later sang a concert broadcast on WLS (AM) with The Little Symphony of Chicago on November 27, 1925.\nIn April 1926 Türk-Rohn performed a program of songs broadcast on WMAQ radio (now WKQX). In 1927 her opera ensemble performed a benefit concert at Kimball Hall to raise money for wounded United States veterans and the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital.  In 1929 she was the assistant music director for a Passion Play staged at the Auditorium Building. In 1935 she conducted a concert of grand opera at the Chicago Commons auditorium. In 1936 she sang at a \"peace meeting\" in New Brunswick, New Jersey reuniting with Herman Spielter as her pianist, and also sang with an orchestra led by conductor Fred Hart. The meeting was organized by New Brunswick's mayor Austin Scott. In 1937 she was a judge for The New Jersey Federation of Music Clubs music competition.\nAt the end of her life, Türk-Rohn lived in New York City where she made her home at 32 E 36th St New York, NY 10016. She died there on 26 February 1940. Her daughter Maud was listed as the executer of her estate and her cause of death named as general arteriosclerosis coronary sclerosis in the New York, New York, U.S., Index to Death Certificates, 1862-1948. That same record stated she was buried at Tresh Paul Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cheater's Game is a 2013 studio album by American country musicians Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis, released on Robison's Premium Records label. The work was the second of four recordings released by the couple and received positive reviews from critics and commercial success on several Billboard charts.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Cheater's Game received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 from four critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that the musicians' \"organic, relaxed, unforced approach is deceptively high in performance skill, yet resonates with an emotional depth that rings true throughout\". Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that the singers \"prove themselves greater together than apart on Cheater's Game\". In No Depression, Jim Moulton praised the singing and song selection but criticized the mixing as being too loud. Steve Horowitz of PopMatters gave this release an 8 out of 10, stating that \"the duo also have good taste in other people’s songs, which they make their own through their distinctive interpretations\"; editors at the site named this the 10th best Americana album of the year. In The Washington Post, Jeff Wisser called Cheater's Game an album of \"breezy harmonies, subtle shadings of acoustic sounds and Robison’s knowing story-songs blended with expertly chosen covers make for a winning country formula\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Cheater's Game\" (Liz Foster, Bruce Robison, and Savannah Welch) – 3:30\n\"Border Radio\" (Dave Alvin) – 2:50\n\"We're All the Way\" (Don Williams) – 3:48\n\"Long Way Home\" (Hayes Carll) – 3:41\n\"9,999,999 Tears\" (Razzy Bailey) – 3:55\n\"Leavin'\" (Robison) – 2:51\n\"But I Do\" (Jedd Hughes and Robison) – 3:29\n\"No Kinda Dancer\" (Robert Earl Keen) – 3:24\n\"Lifeline\" (Robison) – 4:17\n\"Ordinary Fool\" (Robison) – 4:11\n\"Born to Roll\" (Lawrence Shoberg) – 3:08\n\"Waterfall\" (Robison) – 3:02\n\"Dreamin'\" (Robison and Miles Zuniga) – 3:49\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBruce Robison – acoustic guitar, vocals\nKelly Willis – vocals, package concept\nMike Crowley – package concept\nFred Eltringham – drums on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"9,999,999 Tears\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"\nPete Finney – banjo on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"9,999,999 Tears\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"; steel guitar on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"9,999,999 Tears\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"\nMickey Grimm – percussion on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"\nCody Hamilton – photography\nDave Jacques – bass guitar on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"; tuba \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"\nBrad Jones – acoustic guitar, bass guitar on \"We're All the Way\", keyboards on \"Leavin'\", piano on \"Leavin'\", looping on \"Leavin'\", mixing; production\nFats Kaplan – fiddle on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"; accordion on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"\nChris Kro – graphic design, illustrations\nEamon McLaughlin – cello on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"; fiddle on \"Cheater's Game\",\"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"; mandolin on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Border Radio\", \"We're All the Way\", \"Long Home Way\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"\nAl Perkins – steel guitar on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"\nLex Price – bass guitar on \"Cheater's Game\", \"Long Home Way\", \"9,999,999 Tears\", \"Lifeline\", \"Ordinary Fool\", \"Born to Roll\", \"Waterfall\", and \"Dreamin'\"\nChris Scruggs – drums on \"Leavin'\", \"But I Do\", and \"No Kinda Danger\"\nYes Master – audio mastering\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nCheater's Game placed on several Billboard charts: reaching 29 on the Top Country Albums, 3 on Top Heatseekers, and 31 on Independent Albums.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2013 in American music\n2013 in country music\nList of 2013 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCheater's Game at Discogs (list of releases) \nCheater's Game at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "La Herradura is a beach located in the Chorrillos District of Lima, Peru. It has been used as a balneario since the beginning of the 20th century and for surfing since the 1960s. Until the 1980s it was one of the most popular beaches in Lima, visited especially by the city's wealthy families. The construction of the road to La Chira beach changed the configuration of the beach and the shore, which was previously sandy, was filled with stones.\nSince December 28, 2016, La Herradura has been part of the National Reef Registry (RENARO), a registry of protected waves in the country covered by the law on the preservation of reefs appropriate for sports (law no. 27280).\n\n\n== Overview ==\nLa Herradura is located in a place that receives a greater number of hours of sunshine per year compared to the rest of the balnearios in Lima. At the beginning of the 20th century it had a sandy shore, which differentiated it from other spas on the nascent Costa Verde with stones or boulders. Since the construction of the road to La Chira in the 1980s, dynamite blasting changed the configuration of the beach and the shore was filled with stones.\n\n\n=== Surf activities ===\nThe wave is strong, long and breaks to the left with 3 sections: El Point, La Segunda and La Tercera. The waves can reach up to 4 metres high. It is not suitable for beginners.\nSince the 1960s the beach has been used for surfing. There are two versions about the first surf session on the beach. According to Magoo de la Rosa, in 1962 or 1963 the surfer Raúl Risso entered the sea alone to test the waves. According to Óscar Tramontana Figallo, the first session occurred in 1965 when five surfers entered: Fernando Arrarte, the brothers Francisco and Carlos Aramburu, Manolo Mendizábal and Felipe Pomar.\n\n\n==== Championship ====\nSince 2008, the Quiksilver Pro Copa Ripley surf championship has been held on the beach, later called Quiksilver Pro La Herradura and in 2017 King of La Herradura. In addition to rewarding the most outstanding surfers, the championship aims to raise awareness to the population about the importance of conserving Peruvian reefs.\n\n\n== History ==\nLa Herradura beach has been used as a balneario since 1908. With the construction of the La Herradura tunnel in 1910, the tram of the National Electric Tram Company (CNET) had La Herradura beach as the end point of its route. At the end of 1912, the company went bankrupt and the trams stopped running. The only way to access the place since then was on foot or with a vehicle.\nIn 1937 the El Suizo restaurant was built. In the middle of that decade the Palm Beach Club was built. Then, in the 1950s, the Las Gaviotas building was built. In the 1980s, the location where the Kon Tiki restaurant was located was reopened as the La Maquina del Sabor salsódromo.\nOn January 31, 1963, the Caplina, an oil tanker, got stuck 120 metres from the beach, where it could be easily seen.\nIn the early 1980s in Lima, the surf was affected by the construction of the road from La Herradura beach to La Chira beach. The construction of the work in 1983, carried out under the order of the then mayor Pablo Gutiérrez Weselby, without any technical study to support it, affected the cliff, the seabed, the width of the beach, the surf and the ecosystem of the area. The dynamite blasts carried out generated rocks that ended up on the seabed. Due to the above, on June 14, 1990, the Association for the Conservation of Beaches and Waves of Peru (ACOPLO) was formalized, bringing together a group of surfers and promoters of environmental conservation. ACOPLO became the second association in the world dedicated to the protection of wave breaks, after the Surfrider Foundation, created in 1984.\nIn 2004, a GREMCO project sought to build a marina on the beach. Based on the mobilizations of local surfers and the negotiations between the international organisation Save The Waves and the real estate company, the project was stopped.\nIn 2011, the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima during the administration of Mayor Susana Villarán invested more than S/.11 million with the objective of restoring and modernizing the beach boardwalk.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, a dolphinarium located at the beach's surroundings housed two bottlenose dolphins that were transferred from a hotel in the city's financial district and whose captivity was a matter of local controversy.\n\n\n== Protection status ==\nOn December 28, 2016, Directorial Resolution No. 1306-2016 MGP/DGCG was issued that protects the La Herradura surf based on a request established in a letter from the National Board Sports Federation (FENTA) in May 2016. The protection of the surf was the result of the 'Do it for your Wave' campaign organized by Carolina Butrich of the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law (SPDA), FENTA, companies such as Quiksilver and civil society made up of Peruvian neighbors and surfers, like Claudio Balducci and Diego Villarán.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLa Herradura Formation\nCosta Verde (Peru)\nMarine pollution\nBeach cleaning\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carnival Jubilee is a cruise ship built for Carnival Cruise Line. It is the third ship of the Helios class, although it was the first built by Meyer Werft at Papenburg, Germany. It was delivered to Carnival on 4 December 2023, and entered service on 23 December 2023 out of the Port of Galveston in the United States. At 182,015 gross tonnage (GT), Carnival Jubilee is the one of the largest cruise ships in the world.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\nConstruction on the ship started on 18 March 2022, originally for Carnival's sister-line AIDA Cruises, but Carnival announced in June 2021 that it would be taking delivery of the ship instead. After her float out in July 2023 and the installation of the wing funnel outside the building hall, the ship was transferred from the building yard at Papenburg in Germany to Eemshaven in the Netherlands in October 2023. She completed her first round of sea trials on 14 November 2023 in the North Sea.\nIn January 2024, the ship rescued two men on a kayak in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCarnival Cruise Line page\nCarnival Cruise Line: Carnival Jubilee fact sheet",

        "content": "Isaac Schomberg (14 August 1714 – 4 March 1780) was a German physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSchomberg was the younger son of Dr. Meyer Löw Schomberg and twin-brother of Ralph Schomberg. He was born at Schweinberg on 14 August 1714. He was entered at Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1726, and at an early age, under the auspices of his father, commenced practising medicine in London. He had no English degree, and in February 1746–7 he was summoned before the president and censors of the Royal College of Physicians to present himself for examination as a licentiate, but declined the invitation in a letter which was officially termed ‘improbable and indecent.’ In the early part of 1747 he was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and on 7 August 1747, when a ‘student at physic of Trinity College, Cambridge,’ he was baptised at St. Mary Woolnoth, London (Registers, ed. Brooke and Hallen, p. 111). On 3 April 1747 he notified the former fact to the censors, with a request that he might be examined after he had procured his medical degree from that university. This request was refused, and, as he still declined to be examined, his practice was interdicted by the Comitia minora of the College of Physicians on 25 June 1747.\nSchomberg obtained on 21 July 1749 by royal mandate the degree of M.D. at Cambridge, and thereupon, in order that he might become a candidate for admission to the College of Physicians, claimed his examination; but the censors were ordered by the college not to examine him until his prohibition from practice had been removed on proper submission. On the following 1 December, he again came before the censors, and on this occasion with an apology, but it was deemed insufficient. He then demanded (2 Feb. 1749–50) his examination as a right, on the ground that he was a doctor of medicine of Cambridge University. The examination was allowed, and his fitness for the profession was established; but at the Comitia majora next ensuing his admission to the college was negatived by fifteen votes to two, and the interdict on his practice remained in force. He was naturalised in 1750, and made repeated applications for admission to the college, but they were all refused.\nDr. William Battie was one of Schomberg's principal opponents at the college, and was consequently satirised in the ‘Battiad,’ which is said to have been the joint composition of Moses Mendez, Paul Whitehead, and Schomberg. Two cantos were published (London, 1750), and reprinted in Isaac Reed's ‘Repository’ (i. 233–46).\nSchomberg's next step was to appeal for justice to the visitors of the college, and the case came before the lord chancellor and others on 29 November 1751. After several hearings it was determined on 25 July 1753, when the court decided that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. He then applied for examination by the college as a favour; but, on account of the heavy expense of the protracted litigation, the application was refused. On 23 December 1765 he was admitted a licentiate, and as his conduct in the profession had proved satisfactory, and many of his strongest opponents were dead, he was admitted a fellow on 30 September 1771. In 1773 and 1778 he was a censor at the college.\nSchomberg gained an influential position among the physicians of London. His acumen and his generosity of character won him many friends, and a short poem by Samuel Bishop on his death lauds his ‘warm benignity of soul’ (BISHOP, Poems, ii. 149).\nHe was called in, after several other doctors had been in attendance, at the last illness of David Garrick, when the patient, rousing himself from his lethargy, shook the doctor by the hand and exclaimed ‘Though last not least in love’ (Knight, Garrick, p. 289). Hogarth used to give him first impressions of all his engravings, and he was a legatee in William Hogarth's will. He died, unmarried, at Conduit Street, London, on 4 March 1780, and was buried at St. George's, Hanover Square, London. His portrait, by Thomas Hudson, was engraved by William Pengree Sherlock.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Courtney, William Prideauc (1897). \"Schomberg, Isaac (1714-1780)\".

        "content": "King Khalid Airport Mosque (Arabic: جامع مطار الملك خالد) is a Friday mosque located within the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Built in 1983, the mosque covers an area of 5600 meters square in a hexagonal plan and was designed by the US-based architectural firm HOK. It incorporates elements of traditional Islamic architecture and primarily serves Muslim passengers arriving or departing through Riyadh.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe mosque was constructed alongside the King Khalid International Airport by American architectural firm HOK in 1983. It was opened to worshippers in 1984.\nBesides weekly Friday prayers, the mosque also hosts the annual Salat al-Eid prayers in its precincts during the Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha occasions.\nThe airport was the first in Saudi Arabia to be built to then-contemporary engineering standards and the mosque was at the time of its construction the most modern mosque in the world, notable for its use of advances in construction and engineering to create a modern complex in a vernacular Arabic style, and for its program of integral art, at that time the largest in the world, marrying traditional Islamic decorative elements with, and interpreted through, the work of contemporary artists. \nAs per the official website, the King Khalid International Airport offers free shuttle services to the mosque for arriving and departing passengers.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nHexagonal in plan, and enclosing an area of over 60,000 sq ft (5,600 m2), its scale, location and design make it the most dominant building in the passenger complex. The mosque can accommodate 5,000 worshippers inside, with capacity for an additional 4,000 in the surrounding plaza. The mosque's dome, 33 metres (108 ft 3 in) in diameter and internally clad in polished bronze, is internally separated from the lower roof of the building by a seven-foot clerestory ring of stained glass windows, below which runs a calligraphic mosaic band designed by Iranian-Armenian painter Edman Ayvazyan. The dome's apex, at 40 metres (131 ft 3 in) above the arrivals level roadway, is higher than all the other structures in the passenger complex with the exception of the control tower and minaret.\nThe hand-cut glass and marble mosaic, measuring 250 square metres (2,700 sq ft) and fabricated with Clarke's assistance, was the largest in the world at the time,. At the time of its construction, the programme of decorative and integral art for the mosque constituted one of the largest single art projects of the period. In the northeast corner of the mosque plaza, a minaret rises 39 metres (127 ft 11 in) above the plaza level. A spiral stairway inside the minaret provides access to loudspeakers that broadcast the prayer calls five times daily. There are 5,030 square metres (54,100 sq ft) of floor space on the main floor of the mosque and another 765 square metres (8,230 sq ft) on the mezzanine floor. A Koranic library off of the main mosque floor has 50 square metres (540 sq ft) of user space and the same amount for storage space. The library, private offices and lavatories are located along the southeast on the southwest walls.\nIn 1982, through the Vesti Corporation, the British architectural artist Brian Clarke was commissioned to conceive of a scheme of stained glass artworks for the interior of the Royal Mosque. Clarke made a study of Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez and Tangiers for six weeks, and produced a series of abstract designs that engaged with historical pan-Islamic decorative tradition. Completed in 1982 and containing 2,000 square metres (22,000 sq ft)\nIn the interior, the mosque features artwork, carved marble banks, stained-glass windows and skylights, intricate ceramic-tile patterns, and carved wooden doors and screens which make it a showplace of traditional Islamic art. Passages from the Quran are also carved in the Kufic style of calligraphy form the unifying motif.\n\n\n== References ==",

(2023) includes opercles, hyomandibulae, frontals, and basioccipitals, and other partial gonorynchiform remains from the Maevarano Formation probably also belong to Vango. \nMatt Friedman was the first to recognize the presence of a gonorynchiform species in the Maevarano fauna, and Murray et al. (2023) named and described Vango fahiny shortly after.\n\n\n== Description ==\nVango is similar to the extant milkfish Chanos chanos but can be easily distinguished from that species by numerous features, such as the basioccipital and maxilla being relatively shorter than those of C. chanos, and the opercle being overall rounder and having a shorter auricular process.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Açma is a slightly sweet yeast pastry from Turkish cuisine that is often offered as street food. Common varieties are bread rolls, dough rings, and dough rolls, often with additional savory or sweet fillings.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nAçma is a yeast dough pastry, similar to a plaited bread, brioche or Çörek. There are many variations of Açma. The dough typically consists of wheat flour, butter, milk, baking yeast, sugar and salt. The dough is formed into rings, rolls or balls and left to rise again on the baking tray. It is then coated with egg yolk, possibly sprinkled with black cumin or sesame seeds and baked in the oven.\nUnlike the Poğaça, an Açma contains butter and usually no egg in the dough. Unlike the Simit, which is rolled in sesame seeds, an Açma is more like a milk bun.\nAn açma is only slightly sweet, so it can be enjoyed with a sweet spread as well as with salty side dishes such as cheese or olives.\n\n\n== Origin and designation ==\nAçma is popular and widespread throughout Turkey. The place and time of its origin are unknown. No city or region claims to be its place of origin. The word açma probably comes from the Turkish verb açmak 'to open'.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Xylopsora canopeorum is a squamulose (scaly), corticolous (bark-dwelling) lichen species in the family Umbilicariaceae. Discovered in the canopies of Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwoods) in California, United States, it was formally described as new to science in 2018. It is endemic to the central coastal region of California, living within the unique ecosystems of Big Basin Redwoods State Park and Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve, areas known for their ancient coast redwood forests. The lichen evolves from a crust-like to scale-like form, developing into coral-like crusts as it matures, complemented by distinctive flat, black reproductive discs. This species has varying greyish-green to medium brown coloration and occasionally forms soralia, which release powdery reproductive propagules called soredia. Xylopsora canopeorum is distinguished from closely related species by its smaller, partly coral-like squamules (scales), the occurrence of soralia on its surface, and in some specimens, the presence of both thamnolic and friesiic acids within the thallus.\nXylopsora canopeorum was declared endangered by the IUCN in 2021 due to its habitat specialization, severe fragmentation of its range from historic logging, and increased vulnerability to high-intensity wildfires exacerbated by climate change. Conservation efforts are needed for its survival, with accurate knowledge about its distribution hampered by the challenges of accessing the canopy and the need for specialized observation techniques.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe lichen was first scientifically described in 2018 by the lichenologists Einar Timdal, Mika Bendiksby, and Rikke Reese Næsborg. The type specimen was collected by Bendiksby from Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California, at an elevation of 341 m (1,119 ft); there, it was found growing on the bark of a main trunk of an old Sequoia sempervirens more than 100 cm (40 in) in diameter. The species epithet canopeorum is derived from the species' habitat, specifically highlighting its discovery within the canopies of ancient redwood forests.\nMolecular phylogenetics analyses, using sequence alignments derived from both nuclear (ITS and LSU) and mitochondrial (SSU) ribosomal DNA data, have robustly positioned X. canopeorum within the X. caradocensis–X. friesii clade. These conclusions are supported by Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood estimation, and maximum parsimony methods, confirming the species as a distinct evolutionary lineage. To achieve these results, the research incorporated both manual and automated methods for establishing multiple sequence alignments, which are particularly challenging for non-coding DNA regions with variable lengths.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXylopsora canopeorum has a thallus that ranges from crust-like to scale-like in appearance, with individual scales (squamules) measuring up to 0.5 mm in diameter. These scales often evolve into a coral-like crust as the lichen ages, initially adhering flatly to the surface before standing upright in a manner that seeks the direction of gravity (geotropically imbricate). Sporadically, the lichen forms soralia, structures that release powdery reproductive propagules called soredia, appearing in patches and bearing a bluish hue.\nThe surface of the thallus shows a color palette ranging from greyish-green to medium brown, with a matte finish. Its edges may be finely notched or cut and are the same color as the rest of the upper surface. The uppermost layer (cortex) of the thallus is relatively thin, reaching up to 15 micrometers (μm), though it typically lacks a well-defined structure.\nReproductive structures (apothecia), which are common in this species, appear as flat, black discs without a powdery coating (epruinose), measuring up to 0.6 mm across. The edges of these discs remain distinct and may either be smooth or somewhat wavy. The supporting structure of the apothecia (exciple) consists of densely packed fungal filaments, darker on the outer rim and lighter towards the center, without crystal formations. The tissue layer beneath the spore-producing layer (hymenium) and the tissue base (hypothecium) share a pale olivaceous brown color, while the very top layer (epihymenium) is dark reddish brown, also devoid of crystals. The spore-producing cells (asci) are club-shaped, approximately 30 μm tall, featuring a thin amyloid structure at the center covered by a cap, containing orange pigment when young.\nThe spores themselves are ellipsoidal and clear, containing orange pigment when young, measuring 4–7 by 2.5–4.5 μm. Structures known as pycnidia, which would produce asexual spores, have not been observed in this species.\nChemically, X. canopeorum is characterized by the presence of friesiic acid as its major component, with thamnolic acid varying from absent to a minor component. The thallus reacts to certain chemical spot tests, changing color to yellow in the presence of para-phenylenediamine (PD) and potassium hydroxide (K), while it shows a bluish-white fluorescence under ultraviolet light (UV+).\n\n\n=== Similar species ===\nXylopsora canopeorum has distinctive morphological characteristics when compared to its close relatives X. caradocensis and X. friesii, particularly in the size and development of its squamules. These squamules are smaller in X. canopeorum, typically under 0.5 mm in diameter, and tend to form a coralloid crust or develop into soralia as they mature. In contrast, both X. caradocensis and X. friesii feature squamules that are significantly larger, reaching diameters of up to 1.0 to 1.5 mm, and lack the sorediate formations seen in X. canopeorum.\nThe texture and orientation of the squamules also vary between these species. X. caradocensis squamules present a bullate (blistered) or irregularly ascending profile, whereas X. friesii's squamules are more uniform, adhering closely to the substrate or slightly ascending. Furthermore, the ascospores of X. caradocensis are longer, ranging from 6.5 to 14 µm in length, and often show one or three septa, distinguishing them from the typically non-septate and shorter ascospores of X. canopeorum, which more closely resemble those of X. friesii in size. Chemically, both X. caradocensis and X. friesii are known to contain only friesiic acid, setting them apart from the possible chemical diversity observed in X. canopeorum.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nXylopsora canopeorum is exclusively found in the central coastal region of California, with confirmed specimens collected within Big Basin Redwoods State Park and Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve. These locations, situated respectively 11 km (6.8 mi) and 18 km (11 mi) away from the Pacific Ocean, are notable for their ancient coast redwood forests, providing a unique ecosystem for this lichen species. The exploration of forest canopies remains limited, largely due to the challenges and specialized skills and equipment needed to access the treetops. Chaenotheca longispora is another lichen found from a similar location in a California State Park and reported as a new species in 2019.\nIn terms of its ecological niche, X. canopeorum grows on the coarse and fibrous bark of large coast redwood trees, sometimes extending to charred areas of the bark. This lichen is predominantly found at elevations ranging from 5 to 75 m (16 to 246 ft) above the forest floor, growing on the venerable and robust bark surfaces of the redwoods' main trunks. The presence of Xylopsora canopeorum is often associated with a community of other lichen species, including Carbonicola anthracophila, Fulgidea oligospora, F. sierrae, Hertelidea botryosa, and Hypocenomyce scalaris, which share the surfaces offered by the ancient trees of these old-growth forests.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn 2021, Xylopsora canopeorum was assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as an endangered species in its global IUCN Red List. The lichen is facing significant threats primarily due to its specialized habitat in the old-growth coast redwood forests of Northern California. With a natural range that has dwindled to about 5% of its original size due to historic logging, the species' populations are not only severely fragmented but also continually at risk. This fragmentation has been exacerbated by high-intensity wildfires, such as the one in 2020 that affected its type locality, contributing to a decline in both the quality and extent of its habitat. Climate change poses additional threats by increasing the frequency and severity of such wildfires, potentially leading to further losses and extirpation from significant portions of its range, including a potential 97.7% reduction in extent of occurrence and a 33% reduction in area of occurrence if lost from Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Conservation efforts are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the remaining old-growth forests where this species resides. Accurate knowledge about Xylopsora canopeorum is hindered by the challenges of accessing its canopy habitat, necessitating specialized climbing for direct observation and collection, which is strictly regulated within State and National Parks. Additionally, exploring other potential hosts within the family Cupressaceae that share similar bark characteristics to the coast redwood could provide new insights into the species' distribution and resilience strategies. Previous surveys on the epiphytic lichens residing in this hard-to-access microhabitat have led to the discovery of new species.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Patrick Stewart (28 August 1813  – 17 July 1883) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStewart son of the Rev. Andrew Stewart (died 1838), minister of Bolton in East Lothian, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Alexander Stewart, tenth lord Blantyre, was born at Bolton on 28 August 1813. His father had graduated M.D. and practised as a physician before his ordination (Scott, Fasti Eccl. Scoticanæ, I. i. 323, II. i. 247). Alexander was educated in the Faculty of Arts of the university of Glasgow, and became a good Greek scholar. He travelled abroad with his family from 1828 to 1830, and thus learnt French thoroughly. On his return he entered the medical faculty, and graduated M.D. at Glasgow in 1838, afterwards making further studies at Paris and Berlin. In 1839 he settled in Grosvenor Street, London, and there practised till his death. In 1850 he was elected assistant physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and became physician there in 1855, in which year he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was lecturer on materia medica, and afterwards on medicine at the Middlesex Hospital, and retired thence in 1866. From 1850 he was an active member of the British Medical Association. He published in 1849 ‘Sanitary Economics,’ and in 1854 (‘Medical Times and Gazette’) a paper on cholera, and several other papers, but his title to recollection rests upon ‘Some Considerations on the Nature and Pathology of Typhus and Typhoid Fever applied to the Solution of the Question of the Identity or Non-Identity of the two Diseases,’ read before the Parisian Medical Society on 16 and 23 April 1840. This paper was reprinted by the New Sydenham Society in 1884. The observations on which it is based were made at the Glasgow Fever Hospital. From the time of Antonius de Haen (1760), a discussion had continued among physicians on the distinction of certain fevers. Johannes Valentinus ab Hildebrand in 1811 regarded the fevers now known as typhus and typhoid, or enteric, as distinct, and Pierre Bretonneau, a few years later, described exactly the morbid anatomy of typhoid fever. Stewart's experience in the post-mortem room at Glasgow led him to believe firmly in the distinction between the two fevers, and in this essay he states clearly, from his own observation of cases, their differences in origin, cause, course, symptoms, and anatomical lesions, while his remarks against the use of purgatives in typhoid fever entitle him to further distinction as one who has contributed to the saving of many lives by pointing out the danger of what had been a prevalent method of treatment. Sir William Jenner's celebrated papers in 1849, 1850, and 1853 are written on the same lines as Stewart's; but as they were based on a far more extended field of personal observation they had more public effect, and are justly regarded as having finally settled the question. Stewart was an elder in the presbyterian church and wrote in 1843 ‘Divide and Conquer,’ and numerous other pamphlets relating to the church of Scotland. He died unmarried at his house in Grosvenor Street on 17 July 1883. He did not attain to large practice, but both his character and attainments were esteemed by the physicians of his time.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1898). \"Stewart, Alexander Patrick\".

On the album, Oxley, who is heard on percussion and electronics, is joined by percussionist Stefan Hölker, who was previously heard on Oxley's Beaming (2020) and Unreleased 1974–2016 (2022).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review for Jazz Journal, Michael Tucker called the album \"a densely woven yet airy, self-defining abstract soundscape, rich in pointillist texture and abstracted, interlaced pulses but devoid of swing,\" and wrote: \"A tough but engrossing listen, this, which may stand as a memorial to the drummer.\"\nThe New York City Jazz Record's Mike Shanley compared the music to \"a visit to a Percussion Curiosity Shop,\" in which \"low clattering sounds float in, only to disappear quickly.\" He commented: \"The performance never rises to a frenetic level, and even when it flows rapidly, the mood always feels rather gentle... Neither Oxley or Hölker play in a busy manner. They are respectful of each other's space to such an extent that they practically become one sound, with Oxley's electronics acting as an additional voice.\"\nDominic Rivron of International Times stated: \"Listening to the album, I was more than once reminded of the classical music avant-garde of the 1960s. That a sound-world created sixty years ago still sounds new today – and it does – says a lot... Although there are six tracks, you have a sense that, when one comes to an end and another starts, it's because you had to leave the room temporarily, not because the music ever stopped. You get the feeling Oxley and Hölker could've gone on for ever and never run out of things to say.\"\nWriting for the Downtown Music Gallery, Bruce Lee Gallanter remarked: \"I find the music here to be consistently fascinating and pretty diverse. Each piece seems to evoke a different vibe or inner landscape (for the mind)... The sounds here are often pulsating and sounds alive. The more I listen to this, the more I hear the way it is connected and how it unfolds. Is it composition or improvisation or both? Questions to consider as we listen.\"\nIn an article for Exposé Online, Peter Thelen wrote: \"Oxley's masterful refinement of sounds and shadows amid swirling bursts of creative energy offer a unique perspective; these are not merely 'drum solos' or even enhanced solos, but compositions that deserve the most unique attention to every detail... With The New World, Oxley produced some engaging sound sculptures that are at once satisfying and magically haunting on a number of levels.\"\nA reviewer for Freq stated that, on the album, \"Oxley has taken the basic building blocks of percussion and diluted them down to their basest elements, and then magnified those, holding them up to the light and studying them in minute detail.\" He noted: \"these six pieces rise from slow, scattered silence, their scuffling vibrations barely rising above room tone. They feel out the room, touching and gauging; a textural experience to which the electronics add mystery, ever present yet shaded from full view... This album is a soft and seductive delight that throws up new details on each listen and is well worth checking out.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nComposed by Tony Oxley.\n\n\"Composition 1\" – 7:51\n\"Composition 2\" – 6:10\n\"Composition 3\" – 7:03\n\"Composition 4\" – 14:48\n\"Composition 5\" – 5:13\n\"Composition 6\" – 11:41\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTony Oxley – percussion, electronics\nStefan Hölker – acoustic percussion\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alice Macdonald (born 1st April 1983) is a British politician selected by the Labour Party UK to stand as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich North. She is the daughter of West Norfolk Council Labour leader Irene Macdonald.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMacdonald graduated with first class honours in French and Italian at the University of Bristol in 2005, then went on to study a Master of the Arts in International Studies and Diplomacy at  SOAS University of London, where she graduated in 2007 with distinction.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMacdonald grew up in a small village in Norfolk, where she attended a comprehensive school. Her first job was on a local farm; later she worked in pubs, cafes and shops.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nMacdonald served as a councillor in the Newington ward of Southwark from the 7th of May 2018 to the 21st of May 2023. On the 25th of July 2022 she was announced as the official Labour parliamentary candidate for Norwich North. She has also served as a senior adviser to Harriet Harman and Bob Ainsworth.\n\n\n== Charity campaigning ==\nMacdonald was Campaigns and Policy Director for London-based company Project Everyone between August 2016 and April 2023. Project Everyone was co-founded by Richard Curtis and is dedicated to \"achieving sustainable development goals\" via \"campaign materials, [...] installations, [...] documentaries, [and] events\". In addition to her political campaign work, Macdonald currently serves as Campaign Director for Hungry for Action Campaign, who aim to spotlight the global food crisis.\n\n\n== Appointments ==\nMacdonald was a Director of the Potter Fields Park Management Trust, a not-for-profit organisation that manages events and maintenance for a park and a churchyard in Southwark. The appointment lasted from 21st July 2021 until 28rd November 2022, when she resigned from her position.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2019 Macdonald announced she would be standing for the Labour parliamentary candidacy against Karen Davis. Davis previously stood unsuccessfully against the UK Conservative Party incumbent  Chloe Smith (MP). The announcement of Macdonald's candidacy prompted accusations that she unfairly used campaign materials in a manner that took credit for someone else's work. Labour councillor Emma Corlett remarked: \"This video literally uses photos from Karen Davis' campaign on holiday hunger and has you walking past the Vote Labour boards she and I put up with our bare (splintered) hands.\" An additional comment cast doubt on Macdonald's local knowledge: \"Use your local knowledge? What, on a postage stamp?\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Knowsley was a district of the Merseyside metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority was created in 2014 and began electing the mayor of the Liverpool City Region from 2017. The body was given strategic powers covering a region that encompassed the former Merseyside metropolitan county with the addition of Halton Borough Council.\nSince its formation, Knowsley has continuously been under Labour control. The Liberal Democrats had become the main opposition party by the late 1990s, and continued to win seats on the council until the 2010 election, when Labour won every seat. Labour continued to win every seat in subsequent elections until the 2016 election, when three Liberal Democrats were elected. The first Green Party councillor was elected to the borough in the 2018 election, with the Green Party winning a further two seats in each of the 2019 election and 2021 election to become the council's main opposition. After the 2023 election, Labour held 31 seats, the Greens held seven, independent councillors held four and the Liberal Democrats held three.\nThe positions up for election in 2024 were last elected in 2021. That election was originally scheduled to take place in 2020, but was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that election, Labour won twelve seats on 55.3% of the vote, the Green Party and independents won two seats each on 23.1% and 9.8% respectively and the Liberal Democrats won one seat on 5.9% of the vote.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council previously elected its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. However, following a boundary review, all forty-eight councillors will be elected at the same time. The election will take place by multi-member first-past-the-post voting, with each ward being represented by up to three councillors. Electors will be able to vote for as many candidates as there are seats to fill, and the candidates with the most votes in each ward will be elected.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Knowsley aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nFebruary 2024: Steve Guy (Independent) is disqualified having not attended any council meetings for six months. A by-election is scheduled for 21 March 2024.\n21 March 2024: The Whitefield by-election is won by Brian Johns (Independent).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dorothy Leila Rankine (31 December 1932 – 15 January 1993) was an Aboriginal community worker, musician and poet. Known as Leila Rankine, she was a founding member of Adelaide Aboriginal Orchestra and the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeila Rankine, of Ngarrindjeri and Kaurna descent, was born on 31 December 1932 in the Adelaide suburb of Rose Park. She was the daughter of Rebecca Kumi (née Harris) and Daniel Wilson. She grew up and was educated at the Point McLeay Mission Station (now Raukkan) on Lake Alexandrina.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nMarried and with five children, Rankine joined the Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia at its inception in 1966. Alongside Ruby Hammond and Gladys Elphick, she strove to improve education for Aboriginal people.\nWith her sister, Veronica Brodie, she lobbied for the establishment of the Warriappendi School, developed to better meet the needs of Aboriginal children.\nRankine was a founding member of the Adelaide Aboriginal Orchestra in 1972 and co-founded the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music (CASM). In both, students were taught by Aboriginal Elders and encouraged to reconnect with their cultural heritage.\n\n\n== Personal and death ==\nRankine married James William Rankine (died 1969) in 1954. They had five children before moving to Adelaide in 1965. Their daughter, Aunty Leila Gayle Rankine, was a lifelong advocate for Aboriginal people with disabilities and chair of the First Peoples Disability Network.\nRankine suffered from diabetes and complications led to the amputation of a leg. She died on 15 January 1993 and her ashes were scattered on the Coorong.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA rehabilitation facility, the Leila Rankine House of Hope was opened in 2018 at Monarto and run by the Aboriginal Sobriety Group, on whose board she had earlier served.\nThe Leila Rankine Award for Excellence in SACE Stage 2 Aboriginal Studies was established in her memory. Administered by Humanities and Social Sciences SA, it recognises both the \"highest achieving student\" and \"their teacher for excellence in teaching\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotograph of Leila Rankine, founder of the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music, University of Adelaide, 1986 by Juno Gemes",

        "content": "In American football, the starting quarterback is typically viewed as the leader of a team. The quarterback is considered the most important position on the field and among the most important positions in team sports. They are among the most high-profile athletes in North America and have been described as akin to A-list celebrities; in the United Football League, such quarterbacks benefit from national television exposure and in-game action that they may not get as backup or practice squad quarterbacks in the National Football League; former New York Guardians starter Matt McGloin, former Dallas Renegades starting quarterback Landry Jones and current St. Louis Battlehawks quarterback AJ McCarron all cited the ability to have their friends and family see them play professional football as reasons why they chose to play in the league. The success of an American football team often rests on the quarterback; thus, teams will go to great lengths to find a franchise quarterback to build around for the long-term goals of the team. This page contains the lists of starting quarterbacks for the eight teams that played in the XFL, a league that operated for 1½ seasons as a standalone league in 2020 and 2023. This page also contains the lists of starting quarterbacks for the nine teams that played in the United States Football League (USFL), a league that operated for 2 seasons as a standalone league in 2022 and 2023. Four teams from each league now constitute the XFL and USFL conferences respectively of the UFL.\nStarting quarterbacks in the XFL received a substantially higher salary than backups and other position players. In the 2020 season, the salary for an XFL starting quarterback was $495,000 plus a $2,222 bonus for every game won as a member of the team; the \"average quarterback\" on a 2020 XFL roster was reputed to make $125,000, compared to $55,000 for other position players, with both figures including bonuses. The presumed starting quarterbacks were also assigned by the league office and not subject to the 2020 XFL Draft, though this did not guarantee they would start. For 2023, the highest paid XFL starting quarterback, Brett Hundley, earned $200,000 in base salary, while Jordan Ta'amu and McCarron both made over $100,000, in addition to win bonuses. The XFL structure stood in contrast to the USFL, which purposely chose an egalitarian structure paying all players equally regardless of position; as a result, McCarron and Ta'amu were initially hesitant to stay with their teams as they transitioned to the UFL, which operates under the USFL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The USFL's player's union, United Steelworkers Local 9004, gave its permission for the league to sign players at a higher salary, stating that it would only enforce the relevant clause in the CBA as a minimum salary, not a hard salary cap, and openly encouraged the league to sign McCarron, offering to make union dues optional.\n\n\n== XFL Division ==\n\n\n=== Arlington Renegades ===\n\n\n=== DC Defenders ===\n\n\n=== St. Louis Battlehawks ===\n\n\n=== San Antonio Brahmas ===\n\n\n== USFL Division ==\n\n\n=== Birmingham Stallions ===\n\n\n=== Houston Roughnecks ===\n\n\n=== Memphis Showboats ===\n\n\n=== Michigan Panthers ===\n\n\n== Defunct XFL teams ==\n\n\n=== Houston Roughnecks (2020) ===\n\n\n=== Orlando Guardians ===\n\n\n=== Seattle Sea Dragons ===\n\n\n=== Vegas Vipers ===\n\n\n== Defunct USFL teams ==\n\n\n=== New Jersey Generals ===\n\n\n=== New Orleans Breakers ===\n\n\n=== Philadelphia Stars ===\n\n\n=== Pittsburgh Maulers ===\n\n\n=== Tampa Bay Bandits ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Rupotine is an archeological site near Solin, Croatia, which is believed by Croatian archaeologists to be the site of medieval Rižinice monastery. It is considered one of most significant early medieval Croatian archeological sites due to the inscription of duke Trpimir \"PRO DUCE TREPIME(ro)\" which was found here.\n\n\n== Description ==\nArcheological dig Rižinice is situated northeast of Solin, next to the road leading to Klis fortress, on the eastern slopes of mount Mali Kozjak. According to Ivana Čačija, the monastery complex consisted of one nave church facing north–south, surrounded by multiple buildings. The church had a wide semi-curcular apse (16 x 7,40 meters). Its chancel was divided from the apse by a partition. Its small dimensions, claims Čačija, suggest that it was intended for monastery's religious service. Just west of the church, there were two rooms; one of which seems to be the kitchen (as suggested by recovered fragments of medieval ceramics, coal and fragmented dishes with salted olives). The room next to the eastern wall appears to be the funeral chapel as it contained two walled tombs, covered by plates of fragmented Roman sarchophagi.\n\n\n== History of research ==\n\nThe site was discovered in 1891, after accidental discovery of fragment of gable arch from an altar screen bearing inscription: „PRO DUCE TREPIME(ro)“. This fragment was discovered by local people who teared down some wall, while doing property demarkation. The news of this reached Croatian archeologist Frane Bulić who then bought the fragment for the Archeological museum. Due to this fragment, as well as another piece of information provided by Daniele Farlati, Bulić subsequently concluded that the place is a site of 9th century Rižinice monastery built by duke Trpimir of Croatia, also referred to in Grant of Trpimir (Croatian: Trpimirova darovnica). There are, however, experts more sceptical of the idea, such as Ljubo Gudelj Velaga, who claims he's still not able to \"neither to confirm, or deny the idea\".\nBulić conducted initial research in 1895, 1896 and 1908. Eventually the remains of a church with wide semi-circular apse (16 x 7,40 meters) were discovered. After initial research done by Bulić, another series of research was made in 1930's by Ljubo Karaman and Ejnar Dyggve. Dyygve discovered that the site was much larger than previously thought, and considered that it used to be an early Christian church, which was subsequently adapted during medieval period by further adding a walled monastery complex with defensive tower facing the nearby creek.\nThe western part of the complex was partially damaged during 1952 construction of Solin-Klis road when, graves on western part were destroyed. In 1989 Museum of Croatian Archeological Monuments bought the site and continued with the research. In 2006 the road above the complex collapsed revelaing there is another part of the building beneath it, which was not yet researched. According to Gudelj Velaga, this unresearched part could be \"the temple\". He claims that conservator-restorers suggested building a bridge over that part to enable the research, however local authorities ordered to bury it again thus delaying the research. Another round of research was conducted in 2011 when swimming pool and numerous sarcophagi from antiquity were discovered. These sarcophagi, however contained \"subtenants\" from the medieval period. The research also uncovered ciboria and pre-romanesque findings from the period of Trpimir I.\n\n\n== Findings ==\nAccording to Radoslav Bužančić, in its initial period, the site was a Roman Villa rustica, likely well preserved until 9th century, when duke Trpimir of Croatia decided to restore it. Trpimir then donated the monastery to the Benedictine monks whom he brought here. Archeological research discovered several layers of graves in Rižinice. The earliest layer of graves contained bones of deceased people as well as pieces of jewelry like earings and rings. The complex also contained a pagan burial site dated between 1st and 3rd century AD. Besides series of glass, stone and clay Urns, there was also a child grave in semi-preserved amphora, lacrymatories, and a cosmetics plate. From the period of early medieval Croatian state, 10 oval graves covered by stone plates were recovered.\nIn one of the graves, remains of a woman from 10th century were found, whom the archeologists nicknamed \"Joza\". Its skeleton was sent to Penn State University in United States of America, where its CT scan was made. Forensics concluded that Joza died at an age between 23 and 30, that she was well fed and gave birth to least one child. Its jewelry; earings and rings enabled archeologists to conclude that she was put to rest somewhere in 10th century. Joza's teeths were also well preserved and her body did not have signs of single trauma. The same grave also contained older male body (aged 50), which was put to rest here some 100 years earlier.\nRelics found here suggest continuity of burial on the site, spanning from antiquity to the period of Venetian rule in the region.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==",

He was succeeded by his son Legwale.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSeitlhamo was the son of Motswasele I, kgosi of the Kwena people. He was loyal to his father, carrying out his wishes and refusing to take power when his father was infirm later in life. Throughout his life, Seitlhamo fought in several battles against the Ngwaketse people, with whom the Bakwena were in constant conflict in Seitlhamo's time.\nSeitlhamo became kgosi c. 1785. By this time, he had already reached old age. As kgosi, he moved the Kwena tribe from Shokwane to Dithejane, which had temporarily been the home of the Kwena under his father's reign. Kgabo Tebele described Seitlhamo as a patient ruler, in contrast with his predecessor.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nSeitlhamo was killed in an attack by the Bangwaketse c. 1795. Reportedly, the attack took place after Seitlhamo's junior son Mooketse covertly met with the Ngwaketse chief and told him when Dithejane would be undefended. Seitlhamo was succeeded by his son Legwale. Legwale's succession was challenged by another of Seitlhamo's sons, Tshosa. Legwale's mother was Seitlhamo's first wife, making Legwale next in line, but Tshosa's mother, another of Seitlhamo's wives, gave birth first. Legwale's successor, Sietlhamo's son Maleke, led an attack against the Bangwaketse to avenge Seitlhamo's death.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMorton, Fred (4 July 2017). \"To Die For: Inherited Leadership ( Bogosi ) Among the Tswana Before 1885\".

On 1 June, Ho Fuk Wing was stopped by a traffic police officer in Valencia when he committed a traffic violation at a traffic light in the urbanization El Trigal. Both were charged with the crime of \"fraudulent use\" of state money for founding 19 fake import companies between 1984 and 1986 and obtaining dollars at preferential rates from the government. The arrest warrants were part of those issued against five businessmen for false imports into Venezuela as part of the Differential Exchange Regime (RECADI). Ho Fuk Wing was imprisoned for three years before being sentenced and detained for an additional four months.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHo Fuk Wing is often cited as the only person convicted of corruption related to the RECADI exchange control, so the Venezuelan slang has adopted the expression \"chinito de RECADI\" (lit. 'RECADI little Chinese') to refer to a scapegoat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCorruption in Venezuela\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Los \"chinitos de Recadi\" del siglo XXI\".

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "A nanobubble is a small sub-micrometer gas-containing cavity, or bubble, in aqueous solutions with unique properties caused by high internal pressure, small size and surface charge. Nanobubbles generally measure between 70-150 nanometers in size  and less than 200 nanometers in diameter and are known for their longevity and stability, low buoyancy, negative surface charge, high surface area per volume, high internal pressure, and high gas transfer rates.Nanobubbles can be formed by injecting any gas into a liquid. Because of their unique properties, they can interact with and affect physical, chemical, and biological processes. They have been used in technology applications for industries such as wastewater, environmental engineering, agriculture, aquaculture, medicine and biomedicine, and others.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNanobubbles are nanoscopic and generally too small to be observed using the naked eye or a standard microscope, but can be observed using backscattering of light using tools such as green laser pointers. Stable nanobubbles in bulk about 30-400 millimeters in diameter were first reported in the British scientific journal Nature in 1982. Scientists found them in deep water breaks using sonar observation.In 1994, a study by Phil Attard, John L. Parker, and Per M. Claesson further theorized about the existence of nano-sized bubbles, proposing that stable nanobubbles can form on the surface of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces depending on factors such as the level of saturation and surface tension.Nanobubbles can be generated using techniques such as solvent exchange, electrochemical reactions, and immersing a hydrophobic substrate into water while increasing or decreasing the water’s temperature.Nanobubbles and nanoparticles are often found together in certain circumstances, but they differ in that nanoparticles have different properties such as density and resonance frequency.The study of nanobubbles faces challenges in understanding their stability and the mechanisms behind their formation and dissolution.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nNanobubbles possess several distinctive properties:\n\nStability: Nanobubbles are more stable than larger bubbles due to factors such as surface charge and contaminants that reduce interfacial tension, allowing them to remain in liquids for extended periods.\nHigh Internal Pressure: The small size of nanobubbles leads to high internal pressure, which influences their behavior and interactions with the surrounding liquid.\nLarge Surface-to-Volume Ratio: This property is crucial for efficient gas transfer between the nanobubbles and the liquid, which is beneficial for various applications.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nIn aquaculture, nanobubbles have been used to improve fish health and growth rates and to enhance oxidation. Nanobubbles can improve health outcomes for fish by increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration of water, reducing the concentration of bacteria and viruses in water, and triggering the nonspecific defense system of species such as the Nile tilapia, improving survivability during bacterial infections. The use of nanobubbles to increase dissolved oxygen levels can also promote plant growth and reduce the need for chemicals. Nanobubbles have also been shown as effective in increasing the metabolism of living organisms including plants. In regards to oxidation, nanobubbles are known for generating reactive oxygen species, giving them oxidative properties exceeding hydrogen peroxide. Researchers have also proposed nanobubbles as a low-chemical alternative to chemical-based oxidants such as chlorine and ozone.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its basal leaves are narrow, blue-green, and biternate. The species is very similar to Aquilegia flabellata, the fan columbine, differing in having pubescent pistils and strongly hooked incurved spurs.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nA. glandulosa is native to north-central Asia, including Russia (Altai, Buryatia, Irkutsk Oblast, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Sakha Republic, Tuva, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and Zabaykalsky Krai), Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China (Xinjiang). It grows in alpine meadows, and more rarely in forest zones, along stream-banks and on rocks, at altitudes of 1900–2700m.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aquilegia glandulosa at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Lochs is a civil parish on the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles, Scotland. It is one of the four civil parishes in Lewis and extends over the south-eastern part. It is bordered by the parish of Stornoway in the north and Uig in the west. Loch Seaforth separates it from Harris in the south, apart from a  19 miles (31 kilometres) land border with Harris.  It extends about 19 miles (31 kilometres) north to south and 16 miles (26 kilometres) east-west. The Shiant Islands, about five miles (8.0 km) to the south-east, also belong to the parish.\nThe parish is so-named because of the profusion of lochs, sea and fresh-water, in the area.  \nLochs does not have a main village, but instead three clusters of townships within the three main divisions of the parish. The northern division, North Lochs, lies between the River Creed (Gaelic: Abhainn Ghrioda), which forms the border with Stornoway parish, and Loch Leurbost. Its main townships are Leurbost and Crossbost on the north side of that loch and also Grimshader and Ranish on either side of  Grimshader Loch. The central division called Kinloch lies between Lochs Leurbost and Erisort and its main townships are Keose, Laxay and Balallan on the north side of Loch Erisort, and Arivruaich near the head of Loch Seaforth. The southern division, known as South Lochs or Park (Gaelic: Pairc), is a peninsula between Lochs Erisort and Seaforth. It is joined to the mainland of Lewis by an isthmus about  three-quarters mile (1.2 km) wide. The main townships are Orinsay, Gravir, Habost, Caversta, Calbost, and Cromore. \nAt the 2011 census, the population of the civil parish was 1,810. 62.0% had some knowledge of Gaelic. A hundred years before, in 1911, 91.1% were Gaelic speaking (and 97.5% in 1881).   The area of the parish is 114,601 acres (179.1 sq mi; 463.8 km2).\nThe parish originally belonged to the county of Ross and Cromarty. The parish council was formed in 1895 with 11 elected members. This was replaced by Lewis District Council in 1930, which had 19 members, 9 of whom were the County Councillors for Lewis and 10 elected to the District Council from  the four parishes. Lochs had 4 members. Since 1976, this has been superseded by a community council for each of three parts of the parish, namely North Lochs, Kinloch and Park.  Also Ross and Cromarty county council was replaced by Western Isles Council (now called Comhairle nan Eilean Siar), based in Stornoway.\nLochs is also a ward of Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) Council, with 2 members. \nThe parish was not recorded prior to the Scottish Reformation and was subsequently known as St. Columbkil or Loghur, now Lochs. The old Parish Church, serving the whole parish was erected in 1830 on an island in Keose bay, but is now in ruins.  There are now Church of Scotland churches in each of the three parts of the civil parish: Leurbost (for North Lochs), Laxay (for Kinloch) and Lemreway (for Park).\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nEilean Chaluim Chille\nLoch Erisort\nLoch Seaforth\n\n\n== Settlements ==\n\n\n=== North Lochs ===\nLeurbost\nCrossbost\n\n\n=== Kinloch ===\nAiridh a' Bhruaich (Airidhbhruaich)\nBalallan\nLaxay\nKeose and Keose Glebe\n\n\n=== Park ===\nOrinsay\nGravir\nHabost\nCaversta\nCalbost\nCromore\n\n\n== References ==",

It is probably originated from the name of a powerful Etruscan family of the area, Kaikna or Ceicna. In Roman period, it assumed the denomination of Caecina, from which derivative the current name Cecina.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe source of the river is located in Montieri, Province of Grosseto, from the confluence of a number of streams, the largest of which is called Bucafaggi, in the impluvium between Poggio di Montieri and Cornate di Gianfalco, two peaks of the Colline Metallifere. Directing itself north, it flows to the west of Travale, and, after crossing for a small section the comune of Radicondoli, turns to north-west, in a section where it demarcates the boundary between the comuni of Castelnuovo Val di Cecina and Casole d'Elsa. It then enters in the territory of Pomarance, where it receives a major tributary, the Torrente Pavone.\nAfter the river continues flowing on north-west direction, crossing the comuni of Pomarance, Volterra, Montecatini Val di Cecina, Montescudaio, Guardistallo and Riparbella. Then it receives other 2 tributaries, the Torrente Trossa, near Ponteginori; and the Sterza, near Casino di Terra.In the final trait, the river crosses the homonymous comune of Cecina, where flows into the sea through an estuary.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sierra Nevada affair was a corruption scandal in Venezuela that revolved around the purchase of the Sierra Nevada ship during the first government of Carlos Andrés Pérez.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 1 November 1979, an investigation began before a parliamentary commission presided over by the deputy of the Democratic Republican Union (URD) Ramón Tenorio Sifontes, along with deputies Anselmo Natale, Leonardo Ferrer, Pedro Tabata Guzmán and Miguel Bellorin Tineo. Previously, the Ethics Commission of the Democratic Action party had already sanctioned Carlos Andres Perez and two other officials administratively. The affair was important because it would determine the political future of Carlos Andrés and presented a real possibility that administrative corruption to be sanctioned, an issue overwhelmingly discussed by the public agenda.\n\n\n== Complaints ==\nThe accusation was made by Leopoldo Díaz Bruzual, minister in the government of Luis Herrera Campins, which implicated a former Minister of Development of Pérez and the former president of the Corporación Venezolana de Fomento. The accusation revolved around the overpricing in the purchase of the Sierra Nevada ship, and it was intended to charge Carlos Andrés Pérez in this way.\n\n\n== Congress trial ==\nOn 9 January 1980, the People's Electoral Movement (MEP) requested an investigation of the president's assets. A congressional commission, in turn, requested his impeachment for the moral, political and administrative responsibility he bore in the scandal. The debate ended up being decided in the National Congress in a vote on 8 May. The chambers determined that Carlos Andres had political responsibility, but not administrative or moral responsibility. Several independent deputies of Democratic Action, some votes of Movement to Socialism (MAS) and José Vicente Rangel obtained more votes than the deputies of Copei and MAS, and absolved Carlos Andrés Pérez from being administratively condemned by the Congress.\nOne of the possible reasons why many of the votes in favor of Pérez occurred was because the deputies did not want to support the efforts of Rafael Caldera or Rómulo Betancourt, who had distanced himself from Pérez over the issue of administrative corruption, to weaken Carlos Andrés politically. The result was the report known as the Tenorio Report.\n\n\n=== Voting results ===\nCongress in its joint session of both chambers on 8 May 1980 gave as a result of the vote:\n\nPolitical responsibility: 132 votes against the president and 102 in favor (responsible)\nAdministrative responsibility: 113 votes against the president and 115 votes in favor (acquitted)\nMoral responsibility: 111 votes against the president and 119 votes in favor (acquitted).\nThe Sierra Nevada affair was closed by the Prosecutor's Office on 13 June 1980.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTwelve Apostles (Venezuela)\nCorruption in Venezuela\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Tobermory\" is a humorous short story by Hector Hugh Munro written under his pen-name, Saki.  It was originally published in The Westminster Gazette in 1909, first collected, in a revised form, in The Chronicles of Clovis (1911), and has frequently been reprinted in anthologies.\nThe plot concerns Tobermory, a cat who, at a country house party, is taught by one of the guests how to talk.  He converses in a tone of feline superciliousness with the hosts and guests, alarming them with his knowledge of their secrets and his indiscretion in reporting the conversations he has overheard.  In Tobermory's absence they plan to poison him, but his fate is taken out of their hands when he is killed by a neighbouring cat.\n\"Tobermory\" is one of Munro's best-known stories, and generally acknowledged to be one of his masterpieces.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story takes place at a house party held by Sir Wilfrid and Lady Blemley, where one of the guests, the scientist Cornelius Appin, announces that he has developed a method of teaching animals how to speak, and that he has successfully applied his technique to Lady Blemley's cat, Tobermory.  Being a cat of unusual intelligence, he says, Tobermory has learned to speak with perfect correctness.  Tobermory enters and the guests question him.  He answers them in a supercilious and indiscreet manner, revealing many embarrassing comments he has overheard.  Asked by one guest, Mavis Pellington, what she thinks of human intelligence, and hers in particular, he replies that Sir Wilfrid considers her the most brainless woman of his acquaintance.  When Major Barfield raises the subject of Tobermory's carryings-on with another of the house's cats, Tobermory suggests that the Major might not enjoy having the conversation turn to his own affairs.  \"The panic which ensued was not confined to the Major\", and it becomes general when the guests remember that Tobermory is in the habit of walking along a balustrade that runs outside the bedroom windows.  One guest rhetorically asks \"Why did I ever come down here?\", to which Tobermory responds that she came for the food.  \"That woman is a regular Hunger Marcher; she'd go anywhere for four square meals a day\", he reports another guest as saying.  Tobermory leaves suddenly on seeing the approach of a big yellow tomcat from a neighbouring house.  In his absence they all discuss the frightening possibility of Tobermory's teaching other cats how to talk, and consider poison as a solution.  One guest suggests that Appin confine his method in future to the shorthorns on the farm or the elephants at the Zoological Gardens.  \"An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with Henley and would have to be indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement.\"  The remainder of the day is spent in nervous anticipation of Tobermory's return, a plateful of poisoned fish scraps having been prepared for him, but he makes no appearance.  The following day his savaged corpse is discovered along with some tell-tale fur from the big yellow tom.  The party breaks up, and a few weeks later it is reported in the newspapers that an Englishman called Appin or Eppelin has been killed by an elephant at Dresden Zoological Gardens.  One of the characters, Clovis Sangrail, comments that \"If he was trying German irregular verbs on the poor beast he deserved all he got.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThere are two versions of \"Tobermory\".  The first was originally published in the 27 November 1909 issue of The Westminster Gazette, and eventually reprinted in Peter Haining's Saki Short Stories 2 (London: Dent, 1983).  The second, and better known, version dates from 1911 when Munro edited the story for inclusion in his new collection, The Chronicles of Clovis.  In the interests of giving the book continuity he introduced its title-character, Clovis Sangrail, into \"Tobermory\" as one of the house-guests.The Chronicles of Clovis was widely seen by Munro's contemporaries as his best and most characteristic work, and \"Tobermory\" came in for its share of praise.  The Saturday Review thought it \"worthy of F. Anstey\", and S. P. B. Mais wrote that \"For originality of theme it would be hard to beat\".  It has since been anthologized many times, and translations have appeared in French, Dutch and Danish.\n\n\n== Analogues and themes ==\nCats who have been taught speech or other forms of communication have been a not uncommon trope in fantasy and science fiction stories.  One figures in Kurd Lasswitz's \"Psychotomy\" (1893), and they were to recur after Munro's time in Clare Winger Harris's \"The Evolutionary Monstrosity\" (1929), Harl Vincent's \"Prowler of the Wastelands\" (1935), Carl Peregoy's \"Shortwave Experiment\" (1935), and Fritz Leiber's \"Space-Time for Springers\" (1958).  Munro's use of such a character in a beast fable to obliquely criticise social conventions puts \"Tobermory\" in a tradition that goes back to Aesop, Statius, and Horace.  In this fable the talking cat can be seen as representing human nature untrammelled by bourgeois good manners, hypocritical pretence of concern for others, and conventional respectability.  His disruption of the party shows up the artificiality and fragility of the social order.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLangguth, A. J. (1981). Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro.

        "content": "Veronica O'Brien (16 August 1905 – 19 February 1998) was a Catholic nun, a missionary of the Legion of Mary, a lay worker and spiritual adviser to King Baudouin of Belgium and the Belgian Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLouise Mary O'Brien (from her canonical name Veronica) was born in Midleton on 16 August 1905, the daughter of Patrick O'Brien, a physicist, and Kathleen Leahy. She came from a large, devoutly Catholic family. She received her Catholic education from the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Midleton.\nShe had a deep faith from an early age. At her First Communion, she fainted and, when she came to, said that her eyes had been opened to the mysteries of God. This incident was to be repeated several times. At home she was an undisciplined child and as a nun she found it difficult to keep the vow of obedience.\nAfter completing her secondary education with the Sisters of St Clotilde in Eltham, Kent, she worked for a short time as an au pair in Paris. In May 1924 she applied to the Congrégation de Sainte-Clotilde in Paris and was accepted as a novice. Six months later she took the veil and was given the new name Veronica. Returning to her former school at Eltham Park, she worked towards a bachelor's degree and a teaching diploma at Cambridge while living in the convent. She took final vows on 11 August 1930. In poor health she was transferred to a convent near Lausanne in Switzerland. In November 1935 she was expelled from her congregation after she had again shown indiscipline.\nReturning to London in December 1935, she began a Masters Degree in Education, which she did not complete. In 1938, she discovered in Ireland the Legion of Mary. This Catholic association of lay people, who volunteer to serve the Catholic Church, underwent, under the impetus of its Irish founder, Frank Duff, an astonishing expansion.\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, she left Ireland for France to establish the Legion of Mary. She arrived in Nevers, which had just been occupied by the German army. The sisters of the convent of Saint-Gildard welcomed her and she founded the Legion of Mary in Nevers in August 1940. Five years later, the Legion of Mary was present in 44 dioceses in France. After the war, she founded more than 800 base teams of the Legion of Mary, also known as praesidiums. For twenty years she was a delegate of the Legion of Mary on the continent, especially in Belgium, Greece, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\nIn 1947 she met Cardinal Suenens, with whom she began half a century of close collaboration in the service of the Church. In addition to her Catholic evangelicalism, Veronica had a Cambridge university education and a perfect command of Latin. This knowledge proved invaluable to Cardinal Suenens during the Second Vatican Council. Cardinal Suenens and Veronica also wrote many books. In all their writings we find the call to participate in the essential mission of the Church: evangelisation.\nVeronica O'Brien played an important role in the wedding of King Baudouin of Belgium to Fabiola de Mora y Aragón in 1960. Over the years, the celibacy of the King who still lived in his father's house had become a matter of state. Cardinal Suenens discussed the matter with Veronica O'Brien. She met King Baudouin at the Palace of Laeken and, at his request, went to Spain to find the ideal candidate. After meeting Fabiola de Mora y Aragón on several occasions in Spain, Veronica organised a meeting between King Baudouin I and Fabiola de Mora y Aragón. Cardinal Suenens later recounted the circumstances of their meeting in a book about King Baudouin entitled \"Le roi Baudouin, une vie qui vous parle\" (\"King Baudouin, a life that speaks to you\").\nShe also became acquainted with the Charismatic Renewal, a Catholic movement inspired by Pentecostalism. In 1972, together with Yvette Dubois, she visited several university centres where this spiritual renewal was taking place. She took an active part in the growth of the Charismatic Renewal in Belgium, France and the United States and played an important role in the drafting of the doctrinal texts, the Malines Documents, which helped to root the charismatic enthusiasm in the Catholic tradition. She was close to Pope Paul VI and Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, with whom she played a discreet but decisive role in Rome's acceptance of the Charismatic Renewal. She became a special consultant, first in Brussels, at the residence of Cardinal Suenens, and then in Rome, to the International Secretariat of the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Office (ICCRO, now ICCRS).\nIn 1984, with the support of Cardinal Suenens and the approval of Pope John Paul II, she founded a new lay apostolic movement called FIAT (Family International Apostolic Team).\nShe died on 19 February 1998 in Wemmel and her funeral took place in Nevers in the presence of Queen Fabiola.\n\n\n== Tribute ==\nIn July 2015, Pope Francis paid tribute to the important role in the Charismatic Renewal played by Cardinal Suenens, who used the expression \"flow of grace\" to describe this movement, and Veronica O'Brien.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Azerbaijan Cultural Society - the first Azerbaijani diaspora organization in the world was established in 1949 in Turkey. This organization was founded by Mahammad Amin Rasulzade, one of the founders of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The first president of the society was Hamid Ataman.\n\n\n== About ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== Establishment and purpose ====\nThe new phase of Azerbaijani political migration activity in Turkey began with the return of Mahammad Amin Rasulzade in 1947, who had left Turkey in 1931. During the years of his absence in Turkey (1931–1947), Resulzadeh worked as the head of the Azerbaijan National Center in various European countries after the end of World War II, before returning to Turkey. In this new period, the most active migration center became the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, established in 1924 under the initiative of Rasulzade, who led the Azerbaijan National Center.\nThe Azerbaijan Cultural Society, under the leadership of Rasulzade, along with the Azerbaijani National Independence Party, led the struggle for the independence and freedom of Azerbaijan in Turkey, and assumed the mission of being the main headquarters and carrier in Azerbaijan.\nWith the establishment of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society in Ankara, the focus of Azerbaijani political migration activity in Turkey shifted from Istanbul to Ankara. Subsequently, all the activities of the migration, especially the publication of the \"Azerbaijan\" journal, were carried out in Ankara.\nOn February 1, 1949, the statute of the society, founded by Memmed Altunbay, Hamid Ataman, and Aziz Alpaut, listed the following founding objectives:\n\nCollecting, studying, and disseminating information about Azerbaijan, its history, and culture.\nPublishing books, journals, and newspapers and organizing cultural events.\nProviding financial and moral assistance to those in need.\nEstablishing branches for sports, theater, opera, folklore, music, women, media, and youth, and organizing folklore groups.\nOrganizing nature and tourist excursions.\n\nOpening student dormitories.\nThe statute of the Union is constantly updated to meet the emerging needs of the historical process.\nOne of the important goals of the society was to introduce Azerbaijan to Turkey and ensure the support of Anatolian Turks for the just cause of Azerbaijan. According to the \"Azerbaijan\" journal, which is the publishing organ of the society, the main objective of the society was \"to introduce Azerbaijani culture to Anatolian Turks and to further strengthen and consolidate the literary-cultural relations between these two branches of the great Turkic nation.\" The president of the society, Kerim Oder, used similar expressions in his speech in 1958, stating, \"Nine years ago, with your help, we started this path by using the limited opportunities and means available to bring together two separated brothers emotionally and spiritually.\" Oder also added that maximum attention was paid to the unity and cohesion of various Turkic associations when organizing the society's events.\nIn the book published on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the society, the leadership of the society expressed that they had achieved the objectives mentioned above on a large scale.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Turks, together with the modern Ergenekon of world Turks, which consists of Anatolian Turks in terms of language, history, art, culture, and folklore, have demonstrated efforts of unity. Looking back at the 40-year period, we see how much progress we have made and how we have overcome political and geographical obstacles from the Aegean to the Caspian, embodying a cultural integrity... All of these are the results of the work of an art forge that has lasted for 40 years. The Azerbaijan Cultural Society experiences the joy of introducing and endearing Turks to Turks with every step, every aspect, and every situation.\nThe first headquarters of the society was the Waqf Office Building, which was constructed in the Ulus district of Ankara as one of the contemporary buildings of the period. The building was rented jointly with the Turkish Nationalists Association. For a long time, the Azerbaijan Cultural Society used the building on Saturdays, while the Turkish Nationalists Association used it on Sundays. In 1985, the headquarters of the society was moved to Sakarya Street in Kızılay, and in the autumn of 1990, it was relocated to a building in Kavaklıdere. In October 1992, the society purchased a building on Bayındır Street in Kızılay, which is now used as the central headquarters of the society.\nFollowing the military coup on September 12, 1980, the activities of all organizations and associations, including the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, were temporarily suspended. The sealed headquarters of the society was reopened shortly thereafter, following protests from the officials, by the order of the respective military authorities.\nNot long after, upon the demand of citizens living in other cities, the society opened new branches in other cities, primarily in Istanbul, in 1991. These branches began operating in the cities of Izmir, Bursa, Antalya, Sivas, Kayseri, Turqutlu, Soke, and others.\n\n\n==== Activity of the association in the independence process of Azerbaijan ====\nThe process that began in the mid-1980s and led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union was closely monitored by the Azerbaijan Cultural Society. During this period, when the society supported Azerbaijan's independence demands, it also mobilized all resources in the face of pressures and massacres inflicted by Armenians to compel Azerbaijanis, coinciding with the independence process. The society reacted strongly to the migration of Turks, especially from Yerevan, and attempts to occupy Karabakh. In response, rallies were organized in various parts of the country to create public opinion and disseminate information within the society by establishing media centers. The events unfolding in Azerbaijan found their reflection both in the Azerbaijan Turkish Culture journal, the publishing organ of the society, and in meetings held at the society's headquarters. In response to these events, the Azerbaijan National Center organized a press conference on Karabakh and Nakhchivan, rejecting the unjust and baseless demands of the Armenians. In this process, the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, together with the Turkish Societies Association, organized the \"Azerbaijan Events Symposium\" in Ankara on March 26, 1988. From 1988 onwards, the society continued its relations with Azerbaijan in education, culture, social assistance, and other issues without cutting ties. During this period, the society primarily developed its relations and cooperation with many institutions and organizations such as the Azerbaijan People's Front, the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, the Azerbaijan Writers' Union, the Azerbaijan Journalists' Union, and others. These relations soon translated into concrete steps. The first example of this was the \"Literature of Azerbaijan in Migration Life\" symposium organized jointly by the Azerbaijan Cultural Society and the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences from April 1 to 6, 1991 in Baku. On the occasion of this symposium, an official meeting was held in Baku for the first time with the leader of the Azerbaijan People's Front, Abulfaz Elchibey, and a cooperation protocol was signed. During this visit, meetings were also held with Azerbaijan's Prime Minister Hasan Hasanov. As a concrete expression of these relations, a symposium dedicated to the 850th anniversary of the birth of Azerbaijani poet Nizami Ganjavi was held in Ankara from May 3 to 9, 1991, through the collaboration of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society and the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. In 1989, the society also hosted children who came from Azerbaijan to participate in the April 23 National Sovereignty and Children's Day. Additionally, in 1989, famous Azerbaijani poet Bakhtiyar Vahabzade, the president of the Vatan Society, Elchin Efendiev, the director of the Azerbaijan Medical Institute, Prof. Nureddin Rzayev, renowned Azerbaijani historians Abbas Zamanov and Ziya Bunyadov, and the religious leader of the Caucasus Muslims, A. Pashazade, visited the society. In June 1991, during an official visit to Turkey, Azerbaijani President Ayaz Mutalibov also visited the society's headquarters. During this period of rapidly evolving events in Azerbaijan, the society demonstrated multifaceted and active engagement. For instance, in 1991, amidst the ongoing events in Karabakh, the society organized a donation campaign for Azerbaijan Turks injured on the front lines. That same year, as a result of a contract with the Azerbaijan People's Front, the society brought 50 students selected through exams from Baku to universities in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, and provided them with conditions for higher education. The Ministry of Education later adopted this model, pioneered by the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, and implemented this experience in a manner that would encompass the entire Turkic world. Following the victory of the Azerbaijan People's Front in the general elections held on June 7, 1992, relations between the Azerbaijan Cultural Society and the Azerbaijani government further developed. After Abulfaz Elchibey was elected President of Azerbaijan, he made his first official visit to Turkey in June 1992. During this visit, Elchibey visited the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, wrote his thoughts and feelings in the society's honorary book, and also visited the grave of Mahammad Amin Rasulzade, the leader of the Azerbaijani political migration, and the honorary president of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society.\n\n\n== Chairmen ==\nShortly after its establishment, during the first general assembly, Həmid Ataman was elected president, Aziz Alpaut was elected vice president, Feyzi Aghuzum was appointed as secretary, Enver Roman as treasurer, and Mammad Altunbay was selected as a member. During this assembly, one of the members, İbrahim Badalin, proposed the appointment of Mahammad Amin Rasulzade as the honorary president of the society, which was warmly welcomed with enthusiastic applause from the participants. Accepting the title of honorary president, Rasulzade held it until the end of his life. By the decision of the executive board of the society dated May 4, 1949, distinguished figures of the time such as Mustafa Vekilli, Esat Ortay, Hemdullah Subhi Tanrıover, Shemseddin Gunaltay, Fuad Koprulu, Sadıq Aran, M. Y. Mehdi, Shukru Saracoghlu, and Besim Atalay were selected as honorary members of the society.\nSince its inception, the presidency of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society has been held by the following individuals:\n\n\n== Activities of the association ==\nSince its inception, the Azerbaijan Cultural Society has been organizing various events and activities in line with its purpose and mission, including celebrations, commemorations, conferences, panels, symposiums, publication of journals, bulletins, brochures, arranging tea parties, festivals, and balls, as well as forming folklore collectives and providing scholarships to needy citizens and university students. In the early days, the society primarily organized limited commemorative events such as the Novruz holiday, the anniversary of the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on May 28, 1918 (Independence and Freedom Day), and the anniversary of the occupation of Azerbaijan by Bolsheviks on April 27, 1920. However, the number and quality of events have constantly changed with the emergence of new events in historical processes. The society has continued its activities within the framework of women, youth, and culture branches.\nToday, the activities organized by the society include:\n\nMay 28: Anniversary of the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\nJanuary 31: Birthday of Mahammad Amin Rasulzade.\nMarch 6: Anniversary of the death of Mahammad Amin Rasulzade.\nMarch 31: March Genocide.\nApril 27: Occupation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic by Bolsheviks.\nSeptember 15: Entry of the Turkish army into Baku.\nDecember 12: Independence Day of Southern Azerbaijan Turks.\nJanuary 20: Anniversary of the massacre carried out by Russians in Baku.\nFebruary 26: Anniversary of the Khojaly genocide.\nJanuary 12: Recognition Day of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\nAugust 22: Anniversary of the death of Abulfaz Elchibey.\nMarch 21: Nowruz holiday.\nMarch 8: International Women's Day.\nDecember 31: International Solidarity Day of Azerbaijanis.\nThe association, from its inception, has not only been concerned with issues related to Azerbaijani Turks but also pays special attention to events concerning the Republic of Turkey and the Turkic world. Every year, visits to the Mausoleum, the organization of national and various holiday events, dedicating all issues of the \"Azerbaijan\" journal in 1981 to the 100th anniversary of Atatürk's birth, sending congratulatory letters to the Prime Minister and Chief of General Staff of the Republic of Turkey immediately after the 1974 Cyprus Peace Operation, sending a congratulatory message to the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş, upon the declaration of the independence of Northern Cyprus, and publishing a statement in 1985 condemning the persecution and genocide against Turks in Bulgaria as \"a new example of communist oppression\" are just a few examples of the association's sensitivity to national issues. The Azerbaijan Balls, organized and made traditional by the association once a year, attracted great attention especially during the periods of intense public sensitivity related to the political processes in Azerbaijan, and achieved the mass participation of the political, bureaucratic and academic circles of Azerbaijan at that time. For example, at the Azerbaijan Ball held in 1987, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ministers of Agrarian and Agriculture; The party organized in 1986 was attended by Prime Minister Turgut Özal and his spouses, as well as many ministers.\n\n\n=== Organization of conferences and symposia ===\nThe most significant conferences, symposiums, and publication activities in the association's activities are discussed and evaluated separately under the following headings:\nSince the primary purpose of the establishment of the Azerbaijan Cultural Association was \"to collect, process, and disseminate the history and culture of Azerbaijan,\" it has organized numerous conferences and seminars to introduce Azerbaijan in various aspects, more intensively and extensively. The significant number of conferences in the initial years of establishment is mainly due to the absence of a publishing organ within the association. Although the association planned a comprehensive series of conferences to introduce Azerbaijan with its various aspects in its founding year, it is known that some of these conferences could not be held for various reasons. Alongside the regular Saturday meetings where various issues of Azerbaijani Turks were discussed, the list of conferences held in the initial years of the association's establishment is provided below:\nAs seen from the list, conferences held in the early years of the association aimed to introduce the Azerbaijani language, literature, history, culture, customs, and traditions. In 1952, the monthly publication of the association, the \"Azerbaijan\" journal, led to a long period of stagnation in conference-type activities because similar topics were covered in the journal's articles. Towards the end of the 1980s, with Azerbaijan's progress towards independence, the association revived its conference and symposium activities. During this period, the Azerbaijan Cultural Association, together with the Turkish Societies, organized the Azerbaijan Events Symposium in Ankara on March 26, 1988. In this symposium, chaired by Feyzi Aghuzum, Prof. Dr. Abdulhaluk Chay presented a paper on \"Massacres and terror perpetrated by Armenians in Azerbaijan between 1905-1920,\" Deputy Chairman Cemil Unal discussed \"The sources of massacres and terrorism committed by Armenians, behind-the-scenes political games,\" and Secretary-General Ahmad Qaraca delivered a speech on \"Armenian terror and massacre in our poetry.\" The Azerbaijan Cultural Association, in collaboration with the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, also organized a symposium in Baku from April 1 to 6, 1991, on \"Azerbaijani literature in the life of migrants.\" More than a hundred presentations were made by 38 participants from Turkey. The opening speech of the symposium was delivered by the leader of the Azerbaijan Popular Front, Abulfaz Elchibey. Within the framework of the symposium, an official meeting was held with the leader of the Azerbaijan Popular Front for the first time, and a cooperation protocol was signed. Additionally, a symposium dedicated to the 850th anniversary of the birth of Azerbaijani poet Nizami Ganjavi was organized in Ankara from May 3 to 9, 1991, through the joint efforts of the Azerbaijan Cultural Association and the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n=== Broadcast activity ===\nMedia activity plays a crucial role in the activities of the Azerbaijan Cultural Association. Especially in the early years when there were limited media resources, dissemination and promotional activities were only possible through the press. For this purpose, the association published a number of publications, books, and brochures. In the early years of its establishment, the Azerbaijan Cultural Association paid attention to the publication of many works that reflected Azerbaijan's struggle for independence as well as various aspects of our country. However, the deaths of M.E. Rasulzade on March 6, 1955, and Mirze Bala on March 8, 1959, caused a shake-up within the association, leading to stagnation in its publishing activities as in all aspects of its activities. It can be said that the Cyprus Issue in foreign policy and the March 27 Military Coup in domestic policy also had a significant impact on the slowdown of the association's activities. On February 24, 1973, the Azerbaijan Cultural Association held its next general assembly. Feyzi Aghuzum was elected president at the board meeting and held this position until February 24, 1990. During Aghuzum's presidency, particularly from 1978 onwards, a revitalization of the association's activities was observed. During this period, the increasing interest of Turkey's general political understanding in the issues of the Turkic world also influenced the association's publishing policy. Initially focused mainly on Azerbaijan in terms of subject matter, the publishing activity began to encompass general Turkic history, Turkic issues, and topics related to the Turkic world.

However, towards the late 1970s, coinciding with the strengthening of right-wing politics in Turkey and the rise in value of concepts such as Turkism, Turkish history, and the Turkic World, the topics of publications became more diverse. After 1991, publications related to Azerbaijan began to regain prominence.\n\n\n==== Azerbaijan magazine ====\nAfter the Second World War, Rasulzade foresaw the growing importance of culture in the changing world conditions. In 1949, he founded the Azerbaijan Cultural Society to lead the struggle for Azerbaijan's independence and freedom in the cultural sphere. Soon after, the need arose for a media organ to advocate this idea. During the fourth extraordinary congress of the society, this issue was raised, and matters such as the type, frequency, and name of the publication were discussed. As a result of these discussions, the proposal to publish a monthly journal, with the belief that it would be more sustainable, was generally accepted. It was also suggested during the meeting, by Feyzi Aghuzum, who would serve as the president of the society for many years to come, that the journal should be named \"Azerbaijan \". In the first issue of the journal, the introductory article titled \"Beginning\" , signed by the Board of Directors of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, explained the main purpose of the journal with the following words:\nIn accordance with the desires of the members of the fourth congress of the Azerbaijan Cultural Society, we have expanded our publication program with the modest and humble release of this small journal. Until now, our society, which has only published scientific, literary, and historical conferences, felt the need to publish a journal this time to further strengthen its cultural ties with its members in Ankara and the provinces. Through this journal, which will be published monthly for now, detailed information will be provided about the work carried out by our society for more than three years, and we will strive to provide citizens with as much comprehensive information as possible about the history, literature, and art of the Azerbaijani Turkic people, who are so close to the Anatolian Turks.\nThe \"Azerbaijan\" journal formed the new phase of publications of the Azerbaijan political emigration in Turkey from 1923 to 1931. By the decision of the board of directors of the society, the \"Azerbaijan \" journal began to be published under the name \"Azerbaijan Monthly Turkish Culture\" journal starting from the January issue of 1966. With the same decision, Vahab Yurtsever was appointed as the chief editor of the journal, Kerim Alhan (Yaycılı) as the responsible person for general publication, and Ahmad Yashat as the responsible director, in addition to specifying the duties of the chief editor, responsible person for general publication, and responsible director in detail.\nAlthough a decision was made to publish the journal every three months from 1966, due to financial difficulties, the publication of the journal had to be suspended for a period of six months starting from July 1968.\nArticles published in the journal from 1993 onwards were converted into bibliographic index and published on the official website of the society.\nThe \"Azerbaijan\" journal has been continuing its regular publication life for nearly 65 years. It is an important source of information for tracking events related to the Azerbaijani and Turkic world from the early 1950s to the present day. The journal also serves as a unique archive for those interested in tracking the history, politics, and activities of the society.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kuialnyk Cemetery (Ukrainian: Куяльницький цвинтар), also known as Sotnykivska Sich (Ukrainian: Сотниківська січ), is a historic cemetery in Kuialnyk neighborhood, Odesa, Ukraine. It is the largest Cossack cemetery in Ukraine.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, a lot of Cossacks moved to Turkish-controlled territory. Some of them settled in surroundings of Hacıbey fortress, near the Kuialnyk-Khadzhybei bar. Since the narrow bar was constantly flooded, the Cossacks settled near Shkodova and Dovha Mohyla hills. The village of Kuialnyk was established on the slopes of Shkodova Hill, and the Ascension Church was founded there in 1809. But, the cemetery appeared even earlier, approximately in 1775, with the oldest burial dating to 1791, three years before Odesa was founded. Parish registers from the Ascension Church were kept from 1809 to 1822. Later, the Church of the Nativity of Virgin Mary was founded in the neighboring village of Usatove, and since its establishment the parish register was kept there. Overall, the registers contain data on 531 burials. Two-thirds of the last names are of Ukrainian origin, including 18 names of namesakes or direct descendants of Zaporozhian regimental officers, as well as of hetmans (Doroshenko, Chornyi) and general osavuls (Lysenko), and last names derived from kurins.\nKuialnyk Cemetery covers an area of 0.16 ha, with the last burial in 1965. The cemetery includes about 205 tombstones carved from solid limestone blocks, with inscriptions on 33 of the crosses. All inscriptions are in mixed Church Slavonic and Ruthenian and start with the phrase \"здесь почивае раб Божій\" (\"here rests the servant of God\"), followed by the name and surname, as well as cryptonyms such as ІН ЦЙ (Jesus of Nazareth, King of Judea). The oldest tombstone has the inscription \"Здсъ погрєбнъ рабъ Божи младенцъ Иоанъ року Божія 1771\" (\"Here lies the servant of God, the child Ioan, of the God's year 1771\"), but experts date this grave to year 1791.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nFour-pointed crosses predominate among the tombstones, while six-pointed and eight-pointed crosses are less common. In most of the tombstones, the base is wider than the top. The widened bases have triangular, trapezoidal, or rounded rectangular shapes. Greek and extended crosses are very common, sometimes supplemented with a crescent in the base. Maltese crosses are also common, sometimes in combination with a crescent as well. Round and three-leaved crosses are the rarest. Radiant forms are common, consisting of segments forming a circle, the sign of the Sun which represents God in Old Slavic symbolism.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nOn 4 April 2017, the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory supported the initiative of local activists about giving the cemetery the status of a national landmark. In April of 2021, the Ministry of Culture included the Kuialnyk Cemetery in the State Register of Immovable Landmarks.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The British Constructivists, also called the Constructionist Group, or Constructionists, were an informally constituted group of British artists, working in a constructivist mode, with no formal membership or manifesto. The groups most active period was between 1951 to 1955, when its members exhibited in ten London exhibitions, produced two broadsheets and were involved in the publication of two books on abstract art.\nAlastair Grieve's book Constructed Abstract Art in England: a neglected avant-garde  is the first to examine the work of this group in detail, followed by Alan Fowler's PhD thesis Constructivist Art in Britain 1913 - 2005.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nThe core members of the Constructionist Group were: \n\nVictor Pasmore (1908-1998)\nMary Martin (1907-1969)\nKenneth Martin (1905-1984)\nAnthony Hill (1930-2020)\nAdrian Heath (1920-1992)\nRobert Adams (1917-1984)\n\n\n== Milieu ==\nAt first, Constructivism \"promoted the synthesis of painting, sculpture and architecture in the construction of a better environment for a new society. In later years, although the work still conformed to formal constructivist characteristic, this idealism was eroded and the primary focus became the internal logic of the art object, rather than any overt social or utilitarian function.\"\nConstructive art developed much later in Britain than on the European continent, where the International Faction of Constructivists was formed in Düsseldorf in 1922, with no British members. At that time the British art world was influenced by critics like Roger Fry and Clive Bell, who promoted a form of art looking back to post-impressonism rather than anything connected with the new developments in Europe.\nIn Britain, the only significant event in the field of constructive art occurred in 1937, when a book entitled CIRCLE  together with an exhibition called the International Survey of Constructive Art, was staged in London, incorporating painting, sculpture and architecture.\nAs the Second World War threatened, many artists left Europe to move to London, including Gabo, Mondrian, Gropius, Schwitters, Moholy-Nagy, Marcel Breuer, Oskar Kokoschka and patron Peggy Guggenheim. For \"subtle reasons of history and temperament\", none of their ideas took root in London, despite Mondrian's link with Ben Nicholson.\nIn 1951 the opposition to abstract art in Britain, especially constructed art, was still strong. After the Second World War, many art administrators, dealers and critics felt that the initial interest in abstract art developed on the continent would soon diminish. Many leading members of the British art establishment, such as Edward Marsh, Douglas Cooper, Kenneth Clark and John Rothenstein, disliked abstract art. They believed a neo-Romantic form of figurative art would soon become popular.\nIn Britain, the opportunity to see abstract art from the continent was rare, and so London art schools after the war became important testing grounds for new abstract art. Victor Pasmore taught at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, together with Elliott Seabrooke and Kenneth Martin. Seabrooke knew J.W. Power whose book, Éléments de la construction picturale, was to have an influence on the Constructionists. The group communicated with Charles Biederman, whose books Art as the Evolution of Visual Knowledge, and Letters on the New Art had an important influence. Kenneth Martin later taught at Goldsmiths' College and the Central School.\nThe influence of Pasmore, Kenneth and Mary Martin and Hill - as art teachers and writers - on a younger generation of British abstract artists is reflected in the formation of the later Systems Group.\n\n\n== Constructionist Art ==\nThe work of the Constructionist Group is variously described as: constructionist, constructed abstract art, constructed art, structurist art, concrete art, and syntactic art.\nConstructionist art is defined by art historian Alastair Grieve as \"non-figurative art that was not abstracted from the appearance of nature but constructed from within and built up of balanced relations of clear, geometric forms.\"\nKenneth Martin explains that Constructionist art \"... is not the reduction to a simple form of the complex scene before us. It is the building by simple elements of an expressive whole.\"\nMary Martin clarifies that \"Constructed abstract art is not the same as Constructivism ... The process is nuclear and it is in this that it differs from Constructivism. That is to say that one commences with a single cell, or unit, a logical process of growth is applied and ... the whole, or the effect, is unforeseen until the work is complete\".\n\n\n== Group exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== While the group was active (1951-1956) ===\nAlthough Pasmore had converted from figurative to abstract art as early as 1948, it was not until 1951 that other abstract artists started to exhibit with Pasmore, who was a member of The London Group - a society of London artists seeking to exhibit their works outside the Royal Academy of Arts.\nTheir initial exhibition was in February 1951 at The London Group and included Victor Pasmore, Robert Adams, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, Mary Martin, Kenneth Martin, as well as  West Country abstractionists Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Roger Hilton, and Terry Frost. Others included Bernard Carter, Vivian Proctor, Raymond Elston (a mobile), Eduardo Paolozzi, and William Turnbull.\nThis was followed by a more ambitious exhibition in May 1951 entitled Abstract Paintings, Sculptures, Mobiles, at the AIA gallery, organised by Heath with the help of Kenneth Martin and Pasmore. Martin, who himself had broken away from figurative art in the winter of 1949–50, exhibited his first abstract paintings in the summer of 1950.\nThe group exhibited together once again in their First Weekend Exhibition in March 1952 at Adrian Heath's studio in 22 Fitzroy Street, London. It was advertised as a weekend exhibition of sculptures, mobiles, paintings and constructions by Robert Adams, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, Mary Martin, Kenneth Martin, Victor Pasmore and Trevor Dannatt, who arranged the exhibition. Though not advertised, Terry Frost also showed. \nA Second Weekend Exhibition of abstract paintings, constructions, sculptures and mobiles was held in July 1952 at 22 Fitzroy Street, this time including words by Barbara Hepworth, Denis Mitchell and Ben Nicholson.\nIn December 1952 the AIA gallery organised an exhibition in New Burlington Galleries called The Mirror and the Square. The aim was to display artwork ranging from the realistic to the abstract, this time including Eduardo Paolozzi and Trevor Dannatt.\nA Third Weekend Exhibition exhibition was held in May 1953 at 22 Fitzroy Street, showing also furniture and photomurals. As well as the six core Constructionists, there included  Ben Nicholson, Roger Hilton, Terry Frost, Raymond Elston (a mobile), Eduardo Paolozzi, William Scott, Vera Spencer, Terence Conran (a chair), and Denis Williams. \nPasmore accepted a job in Newcastle in 1954, which started to affect group cohesion. In January 1955, Adrian Heath organised the Nine Abstract Artists exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, together with a book of the same title. The nine featured artists were: Robert Adams, Terry Frost, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, Roger Hilton, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin, Victor Pasmore and William Scott.\nOne of the most significant exhibitions was This Is Tomorrow, held at the Whitechapel Gallery in August 1956. It was organised around a constructivist theme and included architects, painters and sculptors. Contributing members of the group included: Richard Hamilton, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Denis Williams, Eduardo Paolozzi, Victor Pasmore, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin and Adrian Heath.\n\n\n=== After the group declined (1957-1969) ===\nStatements: A Review of British Abstract Art in 1956 was held in January 1957 at the ICA. This was followed by Dimensions: British Abstract Art 1948-57, held in December 1957 at the O'Hana Gallery, with the cooperation of the ICA. Although the Constructionist Group produced Broadsheet No.3, it was now in decline and members exhibited only as individuals.\nMax Bill organised Konkrete Kunst in June 1960 at the Helmhaus Museum, Zurich, in which Victor Pasmore, Mary Martin, Kenneth Martin and Anthony Hill took part.\nAn exhibition entitled British Constructivist Art toured the US between October 1961 and October 1962.\nOn 10 May 1962, Mary Martin, Kenneth Martin, Victor Pasmore, Colin Jones, Peter Lowe and Jeffrey Steele took part in The Geometric Environment at the A.I.A. Gallery in London. On 18 May, at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, an overlapping exhibition, Experiment in Constructie, was held in which Mary Martin, Anthony Hill and John Ernest participated.\nThe Arts Council arranged the exhibition Construction England to tour England and Wales in April 1963. Of the Constructionists, Hill, Kenneth and Mary Martin and Wise showed. The exhibition also included works by a younger generation of pupils and associates: Derek Carruthers, Matt Rugg \nColin Jones, Peter Lowe and Gillian Wise.\nMany other exhibitions were held in the mid to late sixties to which former members of the group contributed. Notable is Relief/Construction/Relief which opened in Chicago in October 1968 and in which Victor Pasmore, Gillian Wise, Mary Martin and John Ernest contributed; however it did little to promote the work of the English artists in North America.\nIn 1969 Pasmore left to live in Malta, ceasing to make constructed reliefs. Early that year Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin and Anthony Hill were invited by Jeffrey Steele to participate in the Systeemi•System exhibition at the Amos Anderson Art Museum in Helsinki but declined; Mary Martin died in October that year.\nAt the turn of the decade, as the Constructionist Group era drew to a close, a new group of British constructivists emerged in 1969 called the Systems Group.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSystems Group - successors to the Constructionist group\nConstructivism\nMarlow Moss - the first British constructivist artist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nConstructivist Art in Britain 1913-2005 by Alan Fowler (2006)\nConstructionism in the Tate Gallery",

The Huskies compiled a perfect 10–0 record, won the Metropolitan Conference championship, and outscored opponents by a total of 253 to 110.\nDespite being the only undefeated and untied football team in Southern California, and being ranked No. 5 in the Williamson ratings for small colleges, the Huskies finished second in the voting to represent the west in the Junior Rose Bowl and declined an invitation to play in the Gold Dust Bowl. One official stated, \"East Los Angeles retires from the Metropolitan Conference football season undefeated, untied, unwanted and uninvited.\"\nEast Los Angeles freshman end Bill Hattig was selected as a first-team players on the 1949 All-Southern California junior college football team. Three East Los Angeles players were named to the second team: backs Ed Sherrill and Jimmy Dyer and center Nick Sadd.\nFour East Los Angeles players were selected as first-team players on the 1949 All-Metropolitan Conference football team: quarterback Bob Sherrill; end Bill Hattig; center Nick Sadd; and back Skippy Dyer. End Bob Hughes and guard Penington were named to the second team. Sadd received the honor for the second consecutive year.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The heaviest air raid took place on October 6, 1944.\n\n\n== Bombing on October 6, 1944 ==\nThe attack was carried out by the Eighth Air Force flown with the order number 8AF 667 which conducted their operation from Great Britain. At 10 and 11 a.m. the first warnings were sent by the air traffic control command. The first is that the bomber groups are over the North Sea and the second is that the group is over Schleswig-Holstein. At 11:55 the air raid alarm was sounded in Stralsund. The message “Attention Stralsund flashlight” was broadcast on the radio, which is a code word for the population to go to the air raid shelters.\nThe flying squadron then approached from the southeast.\nThe attack began at 12:30 and ended at 2 p.m. where 1,400 explosive bombs (367 tons) were dropped.\nThe first wave of attacks was carried out by 37 aircraft from the 361st Bomb Group. The power station and the waterworks were destroyed. The Rügendamm, the port area, the Frankenvorstadt and the city center were also bombed in the first wave.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mysouffa turrita is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\n(Described as Actaeon turritus) The strongish, oblong shell is pale yellow, translucent and somewhat glossy. It has a high conical coarsely tipped spire and rounded striated whorls. \nSculpture: Longitudinals -there are many feeble lines of growth. Spirals - the surface of the shell is scored with narrow shallow, irregular, unequal, distant furrows formed by hardly continuous stipples, which are round on the upper whorls and oblong on the body whorl. Between these furrows there often occurs a weaker one formed in the same way. On the base of the shell they are small and crowded. Toward the upper suture they are strong. On the first in particular they are so. \nColour: the shell itself is translucent white, but is covered with very thin yellow membranaceous epidermis.\nThe spire is high, conical, and scalar. The protoconch is very coarse and blunt, slightly immersed, but not inverted. The shell contains six whorls, rounded above, cylindrical below. The body whorl is short and slightly tumid. The suture is very little oblique, strong and somewhat channelled. The aperture is oval to pear-shaped. The outer lip leaves the body at a right angle. It is regularly arched throughout and patulous in front. A thin defined glaze crosses the inner lip and runs direct down the columella  with a straight sharp edge, behind which is a minute chink. The tooth, which is close up to the body, is very slight and blunt.  \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil; in the Caribbean Sea off Panama, Guadeloupe, the Virgin Islands.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

        "content": "Waziristan rebellion was a rebellion by the Pashtun leader Faqir of Ipi to secede from Pakistan and establish a separate Pashtun state of Pashtunistan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 21 June 1947, the Faqir of Ipi, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and other Khudai Khidmatgars held a jirga in Bannu during which they declared the Bannu Resolution, demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new dominions of India or Pakistan.\nHowever, the British government refused to comply with the demand of the Bannu Resolution and only the options for Pakistan and India were given.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\nThe Faqir of Ipi rejected the creation of Pakistan after the partition of British India, considering Pakistan to have only come into existence at the insistence of the British.\nIn 1948, the Faqir of Ipi took control of North Waziristan's Datta Khel area and declared the establishment of an independent Pashtunistan, forming ties with regional leaders including Prince Mohammed Daoud Khan.\n\n\n== Mughalgai raid ==\n\nIn June 1949 a Pakistan Air Force  warplane inadvertently bombed the Afghan village of Mughalgai on the Waziristan border with Afghanistan while chasing the Pashtunistan  separatists who attacked Pakistani border posts from Afghanistan,this attack killed 23 people and further fuelled Afghan support for Pashtunistan.\n\n\n== Gurwek Jirga ==\nOn 29 May 1949, the Faqir of Ipi called a tribal jirga in his headquarters of Gurwek and asked Pakistan to accept Pashtunistan as an independent state. He published a Pashto-language newspaper, Ghāzī, from Gurwek to promote his ideas.Afghanistan also provided financial support to the Pashtunistan movement under the leadership of the Faqir of Ipi. Faqir also established a rifle factory in Gurwek with the material support provided by the government of Afghanistan.\nIn January 1950, a Pashtun loya jirga in Razmak symbolically appointed the Faqir of Ipi as the first president of the \"National Assembly for Pashtunistan\".\n\n\n== 1953-54 Gurwek bombing campaign ==\nIn 1953–1954, the PAF's No. 14 Squadron led an operation from Miramshah airbase and heavily bombarded the Faqir of Ipi's compound in Gurwek.\n\n\n== Decline ==\nAfter sometime, the Faqir of Ipi relations with the government of Afghanistan deteriorated and he became aloof. By this time, his movement had also started losing popular support. The Pashtun tribesmen were no longer willing to fight after the departure of British as the Faqir's reasoning of waging jihad against a foreign power was no longer considered valid.\nAlthough he himself never surrendered until his death, his movement diminished after 1954 when his Commander-in-chief Mehar Dil Khan Khattak surrendered to the Pakistani authorities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWaziristan campaign (1919–1920)\nWaziristan campaign (1936–1939)\nBajaur Campaign\nPakistan-Afghanistan skirmishes\nPashtunistan\nFaqir of Ipi\n1950 Afghan invasion of Balochistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKaur, Kulwant (1985).

        "content": "The Central University of Venezuela rectorate takeover was an action carried out on 28 March 2001 by a group of left-leaning university students who violently took over the facilities, demanding a \"university constituent assembly\".\nThe seizure began after a group of students, after an assembly was called in the Aula Magna, went to the University Council meeting room, threw tear gas canisters and beat up both security guards and professors. The events caused the suspension of classes at the university. The occupation lasted for 36 days, during which the violence escalated until 3 May, when the student community decided to respond to the classes suspension and expelled the occupiers by force from the rector's office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGiuseppe Giannetto served as Vice Rector of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) between 1996 and 2000 during the tenure of Trino Alcides Díaz, Despite their ideological differences, given that Trino was a government supporter, the two maintained excellent relations. Alcides Díaz later served as director of SUDEBAN, SENIAT and as Venezuela's ambassador to Mexico. In the rectorate elections Giannetto overwhelmingly defeated Nelson Merentes, President Hugo Chávez's and Trino's candidate, and was elected to the position in 2000.\nDuring his tenure, Giannetto appointed Héctor Navarro as postgraduate director and Nelson Merentes as coordinator of the scientific development council, the two most important academic positions after the deans. The rector maintained good relations with the government, and the articulation between the executive and the university authorities managed to return the Caracas Botanical Garden and the Rental Zone to university's control. Additionally, the UNESCO officially inscribed the University City of Caracas on the list of World Heritage Sites on 2 December 2000.\nBeyond the usual student claims within the university, there was a climate of normality in the university space, with some exceptions. In January 2001, the Olympic Stadium of the UCV was taken over by the same group that a few months later took over the university's rector's office to prevent the Caracas Pop Festival from being held and to reject \"the privatization of university spaces\". Fernando Rivero, one of the participants in the takeover of the rectorate, by then an eighth semester student of Philosophy and third year law student and later a member of the 2017 Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela, told El Estímulo that the position was one of the main demands of the movement.\n\n\n== Takeover ==\nOn the morning of 28 March 2001, a group of students from different faculties and schools of the university called an assembly in the Aula Magna, which was joined by some members of the labor union and professors. At the same time, in the meeting room of the University Council (UC), the debate between the authorities and student representatives was taking place normally. At one point, those present were notified of the events in the Aula Magna and that they could go all the way to the University Council. A group of professors, including Luis Fuenmayor (who was close to the government), was appointed to dialogue with the students in company of the campus security guards in response to the violent attitude taken by the group.\nWhen the students arrived from the Aula Magna, among whom the occupiers assume the action as \"an act of cowardice\" on the part of the rector, the professors came out to try to mediate with them, telling them that they were discussing in the board of directors and that they were about to be received. According to Gianetto, the student group that stormed the session room numbered around 100 people. The students threw tear gas canisters and beat both security guards and teachers, who took refuge in the meeting room. Gianetto suspended the University Council in response to the violence and withdrew to his office. By the end of the afternoon, the violent atmosphere was reinforced with the arrival of other groups sympathetic to the Bolivarian revolution. According to the rector, from his office he heard numerous detonations.\nIn an interview, Rector Gianetto says that around 7 p.m. he was approached by a security guard that informed that professor Agustín Blanco Muñoz was outside, the only professor who had broken into the session hall, and that he had \"[ensured] his physical integrity\" if he left the rectorate \"because he [was] the new rector.\" Gianetto responded:\n\nLook, Sergio, tell him and the others that I leave here with my head held high or feet first, but the rector's office is not surrendered.\nAlong with professor Elizabeth Marval, university secretary, and Margara Rincón, director of human resources, Gianetto decided to barricade themselves in the rector's office, where they remained for five days. The students took over the facilities demanding a \"university constituent assembly\". Academic activities were suspended on the university campus and rumors about the possible intervention of the university started circulating.\nPresident Hugo Chávez, although he did not dismiss the objectives of the occupiers, did not directly support them either. According to Gianetto, the Minister of the Secretariat of the Presidency Elías Jaua had called him to assure him that the government did not support the events. As the rectorate takeover progressed, a court filed an injunction and gave the order for the Armed Forces to evacuate the university. The government interceded and appointed Attorney General Isaías Rodríguez as mediator of the conflict. There was not a unified position within Chavismo regarding the takeover. The most radical, among whom the rector highlighted Adina Bastidas, Eliécer Otaiza, Iris Varela and Freddy Bernal, fervently defended the occupiers, while the more moderate currents remained neutral.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe student community reacted negatively against the occupiers for the classes suspension and weeks later, on 3 May, they decided to expel them. Gianetto says that the students stormed the University Council meeting room, breaking the glass access door of the rector's building because the occupiers  had chained it shut, climbing into the meeting room and beginning to forcibly remove the occupiers. A large group of students formed a human corridor through which pushed them out of the building.\nAfter the rectorate takeover, the opening of an academic record was requested and an instructor was appointed to conduct an investigation of the events. Professors and students who witnessed the events testified against those involved. Fernando Rivero was expelled for five years from the university for his participation in the takeover, when he was only two semesters away from graduating from the Philosophy School. Among those expelled, but with an administrative record, was the general secretary of the Association of Administrative Employees of the UCV, Eduardo Sánchez. The only participant who was not sanctioned was Professor Agustín Blanco Muñoz.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe seizure of the rector's office would give rise to the M-28 movement, a Chavista movement at the Central University. The rectorate takeover was one of the most violent episodes at the university since the 1984 Tazón massacre, when National Guard soldiers shot and wounded at least 35 students, although none of them died.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutonomous university\nOperación Canguro\nTazón massacre\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGiuseppe Giannetto, 28 March 2018, El Estímulo - YouTube\nEl Observador Caso Los Tomistas UCV",

Distributed by Filmax, it was released theatrically in Spain on 12 January 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nToni Vall of Cinemanía rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, underscoring that \"you do not always understand it, but it is quite addictive\" in the verdict.\nJordi Batlle Caminal of Fotogramas rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, deeming it to be \"as easy to watch as to forget\" as well as \"functional, light entertainment\" in which Gutiérrez and Poza are in their element.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lillian Milgram Schapiro (August 20, 1902 – September 6, 2006) was an American pediatrician, a specialist in the treatment of childhood tuberculosis. She was also known as the wife and assistant of art historian Meyer Schapiro, and she worked on publishing his writings after his death.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMilgram was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Benjamin Milgram and Dora Silverstone Milgram. Her parents were both immigrants from Russia. She graduated from Barnard College in 1924, and from the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1928. Her brother Joseph Milgram was an orthopedic surgeon.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSchapiro served internships and residency at Bellevue Hospital, with some further training in Europe in the 1930s. She taught in the Children's Tuberculosis Division at Bellevue, and had a private practice in pediatrics in Greenwich Village.\nSchapiro also assisted her husband, Meyer Schapiro, in his work as an art historian. She compiled a bibliography of his work in 1995, and after he died, she worked on publishing some of his writings posthumously, editing and writing introductory essays to accompany his work. The couple gave a series of interviews between 1992 and 1995; highlights from these interviews were published in 1997.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Body Build in Infants: IV. The Influence of Retarded Growth\" (1934, with Harry Bakwin and Ruth Morris Bakwin)\n\"Promizole Treatment of Miliary Tuberculosis: Toxic Effects on Thyroid Gland and Maturation\" (1947, with Irving Levitt and Maya S. Unna)\n\"Skeletal Tuberculosis in Children Treated for Primary and Miliary Tuberculosis\" (1956)\nMeyer Schapiro: The Bibliography (1995)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMilgram married Meyer Schapiro in 1928. They had two children, Miriam and Ernest. Her husband died in 1996, and she died in 2006, at the age of 104.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeyer Schapiro Abroad: Letters to Lillian and Travel Notebooks (Getty Publications 2009).",

        "content": "NGC 4670 is a blue compact galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices. The galaxy lies about 60 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 4670 is approximately 25,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 6, 1785.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe overall shape of the galaxy is categorised as peculiar and it has been categorised as amorphous or as barred lenticular galaxy. NGC 4670 is included in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the galaxies with diffuse counter tails category. The gas kinematics indicate the presence of a central bar. The galaxy is seen with an 28° inclination but it is possibly warped.\nNGC 4670 is characterised by its blue color, which was noted by Guillermo Haro in a study published in 1956. Such galaxies are characterised by episodes of intense star formation. The centre of NGC 4670 hosts a supergiant HII region and also hosts most of the hydrogen of the galaxy. The hydrogen lies in three clouds with an estimated mass of 108 M☉. Four other HII regions are visible near the central region.\nThe galaxy has also ionised gas outside of the central region, forming bubbles and filaments. The two larger filaments extend to the southwest and northeast and a have a calculated length of 7.5 and 6.5 kpc respectively.\nAn X-ray and radio source has been detected in the galaxy at the location of a star cluster complex but its nature is uncertain. It could be a massive black hole, an ultraluminous X-ray bubble, an X-ray binary star or a supernova remnant.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 4670 is considered to be a member of the NGC 4565 Group, which also includes, apart from NGC 4565, the galaxies NGC 4494, NGC 4562, NGC 4725, and NGC 4747.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 4670 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "TAV College (French: Collège TAV) is a not-for-profit private CÉGEP in the Snowdon neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Torah and Technology School was founded in 1989, with the aim of providing vocational training to members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. It was later renamed the Torah and Vocational (TAV) Institute. TAV received government funding via an affiliation with the public CÉGEP Collège Marie-Victorin, through which students could obtain a Diploma of College Studies or Attestation of College Studies certificate.\nIn 1999, TAV signed a three-year agreement with the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), under which students at TAV could earn university credits. The partnership ended the following year due to objections from UQAM's professors' union that some courses at TAV were gender-segregated and taught in English. TAV launched a lawsuit against UQAM for $8.1 million in damages.\nQuebec's Ministry of Education and Higher Education cut the institute's funding in 2009 by ending its partnership with Collège Marie-Victorin, on the grounds that TAV didn't offer classes on Jewish holidays and that some classes were gender-segregated. TAV was accredited as an independent, private CÉGEP by the Ministry in 2010, and renamed the Technology and Vocational (TAV) College.\nTAV College introduced a Grade 12 program in 2022 in response to Bill 96, which introduced caps on how many students could be admitted to English-language CÉGEPs.\n\n\n== References ==",

He lived with his grandmother from birth until he reached the fifth year of primary school. Chan began filming several advertisements between the ages of four and five. He later attended Ma On Shan Tsung Tsin Secondary School. In 2003, two years after graduating, he participated in a rookie singing contest hosted by Emperor Entertainment Group. Although he was eliminated in the round of sixteen, he was offered a contract as an artist with Emperor. Initially assigned to join the boy group Boy'z, Chan's lack of interest in dancing and consistent skipping of training sessions led to his removal from the group. He was then given a few film roles by the artist agency, including a minor role as the younger brother of Barbie Hsu's character in the 2008 film Connected. Despite having only one scene in the initial script, his role was expanded by Benny Chan after being impressed by his performance. Chan also gained recognition for his role in the 2008 TVB television series  Dressage To Win. In 2009, Chan starred in the romance film Happily Ever After. However, due to his constant improvisation on set and failure to adhere to the script, he faced industry blacklisting and did not receive any roles for the following three years. In 2012, director Heiward Mak approached Chan after previously discussing his visions in films and offered him a lead role in the drama film Diva. While Chan had considered leaving the entertainment industry and pursuing a career in insurance by that time, Mak encouraged him to continue his passion for acting. Chan then decided to join Emperor Entertainment Group's newly-formed film department. In 2015, he landed several roles in the recently established HKTV, including his lead role as Chung Lok-tin in Incredible Mama and supporting lead role as Max in Love in Time. He also portrayed the main villain, Simon, in Dante Lam's sports film To the Fore, during which he severely injured his left clavicle. Despite the injury, he convinced the production crew that he could continue filming and was allowed to return.\nChan's breakout role came in 2016 when he starred as Chan Kai-yuk, a temperamental young man from Guangzhou searching for his father in Hong Kong, in the romance film Happiness alongside Kara Wai. His performance earned him Best Supporting Actor in the 7th Golden Lotus Awards. Following the breakthrough performance, Chan received more role offers, including the lead role in the 2018 musical biographical film House of the Rising Sons. In the same year, he was invited by Amy Wong to star as Chung Ding Kwok, a co-leading role with Wayne Lai and David Chiang, in the TVB mystery fantasy series Daddy Cool, further solidifying his public recognition. He also had a supporting lead role in the business-themed mystery web series The Trading Floor, which earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer in the 24th Huading Awards. In 2019, Chan took on the lead role of Jack Yau, a police officer in a relationship with his Dressage to Win co-star Michelle Wai, in the action thriller film The White Storm 2: Drug Lords. He also had supporting roles in the action thriller films Integrity and Bodies at Rest. In 2020, Chan was cast in a lead role in Patrick Kong's romance film You Are the One, and as Yip Wing Shun, the sole male lead, in the mystery thriller film Declared Legally Dead, for which he was nominated for Best Actor in the 12th Golden Lotus Awards. He also had a supporting lead role in Dante Lam's action film The Rescue.\nIn 2021, Chan starred as Guy, the male lead in the romantic comedy film Ready o/r Knot, once again alongside Michelle Wai. The duo portrayed a pair of lovers about to get married, yet each with their own hesitations. He also took on the lead role of Ho Hok Ming in the mystery thriller film The Attorney, and made brief appearances as Donnie Yen's character's supervisor and Adam Cheng in the action thriller film Raging Fire and the biographical film Anita respectively. Chan was cast in a supporting role in the 2022 crime thriller film Detective vs Sleuths, and appeared in main roles in the 2023 action films Echoes Of The Thunder and The Brotherhood Of Rebel. He also reprised his role as Guy in Ready or Rot, the sequel of Ready o/r Knot, and appeared in a supporting role in the crime thriller film The Goldfinger in the same year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nChan began dating actress Jennifer Yu after their collaboration in the 2014 television series A Dream Comes True 2014. Although Chan mentioned plans of marriage in an interview with Ming Pao in March 2018, he announced their breakup in June after three years of being in a relationship.\nIn 2020, Chan was rumored to be in a relationship with singer Shiga Lin after filming a TVB traveling program the previous year.

        "content": "Gert's Inferno is a graphic novel, written by Skottie Young and illustrated by Brett Bean that was released in five parts throughout 2022 and 2023 by Image Comics, as the first volume of the 2022 revival of Young's 2015–2018 isekai comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe, and the fifth volume overall. Part 1, Fairyland!, was released on November 16, 2022, Part 2, The Inferno, was released on December 21, 2022, Part 3, Gertlins!, was released on January 18, 2023, Part 4, Intervention?!, was released on February 15, 2023, and Part 5, This World, was released on March 15, 2023, including a soundtrack by Jack the Radio.\nFollowing her return to Earth, the now-adult Gertrude \"Gert\" is hired by \"villainaire\" William Wiggins both to retrieve his son from Fairyland, and \"acquire\" the planet for him to convert into a \"theme planet\", traversing through the Fairyland-adjacent hellscape \"The Inferno\" in order to find her way back. Bridged from Sadly Never After with Fluff the World, it is followed by the story arc Last Gert Standing.\nThe series has received a universally positive critical reception.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn the final issue of Sadly Never After in July 2018, then-intended as the final chapter of I Hate Fairyland as a whole, Skottie Young expressed interest in one-day returning to the series, stating:\n\n\"I'll tease a little of the future. While this is the end of I HATE FAIRYLAND as an ongoing series, that doesn't mean we can't drop into the world from time to time, whether it be a one-shot of a mini-series of \"TALES OF\"-style stories. Nothing is on the schedule just yet, but talks have been had and ideas have been scribbled down. So for now it's not a GOOD-BYE, but more of a SEE YA LATER.\"\nIn August 2021, Young confirmed I Hate Fairyland would be revived in 2022 with a new #1 issue, in what would become Gert's Inferno, with Brett Bean replacing Young as the series' primary artist, following Gert as she is paid to return to Fairyland to rescue a missing child. Brett Parsons was originally being announced as series' new artist, in what would become Fluff the World, a storyline bridging Sadly Never After and Gert's Inferno, and digitally published as part of an anthology series.\n\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nFor the final chapter of Gert's Inferno, released on March 15, 2023, Skottie Young collaborated with the indie roots rock band Jack the Radio to produce a song written and performed specifically for the issue, to be listened to while reading the dialogue-free first three-quarters of the issue as its accompanying soundtrack, and accessible via a QR code included at the beginning of the individual issue.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGert's Inferno at Image Comics",

The series was a great success during its broadcast, and later  an album with its featured songs was released. Despite being broadcast on channel 5, Sopotocientos was a community program, which meant that other Venezuelan television channels collaborated in the production. The series was promoted by First Lady Alicia Pietri de Caldera, and was both advised and directed by psychologist Alba Revenga, who was later in charge of the contents of the Children's Museum of Caracas.\nAccording to Alicia Pietri, the series reached an audience of over a million children viewers and was awarded the Meridiano de Oro and Guacaipuro de Oro awards.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nRascón Corroncho: Hedgehog played by Óscar Ibarra\nPotamito: Hippopotamus played by Martha Velasco\nDoña Coco: Crocodile played by María Luisa Lamata\nPablito: Hugo Rojas\nTinita: Karin Lechner\nThe father: Julio Capote\nThe mother: América Alonso\n\n\n== See also ==\nChildren's Museum of Caracas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nExcelentes: Alba Revenga  - Analítica, Miguel Ángel Blanco, consultado el 1 de diciembre de 2021 (archivado el 26 de julio de 2013)",

        "content": "Stefan Kliński (24 September 1947 – 22 April 2023) was a Polish footballer who played as a defender. Kliński made over 200 appearances in Poland's top division, and also represented Poland in their youth teams.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Club career ===\nDue to where Kliński was brought up, he was only a walk away from the Szombierki Bytom stadium, and tried out for the clubs youth teams. Despite his young age Kliński showed great potential and made his Szombierki debut in the I liga, then Poland's top division, 16 days before his 16th birthday. He would go on to have a successful career with Szombierki, making 149 appearances in the I liga, while also contributing 3 goals over 9 seasons. With Szombierki Bytom he also won a league runners-up medal for the 1964–65 season. Kliński's career however was put on hold after he was arrested and sent to prison for 2 years regarding a crime of a \"moral nature\" with one of his Szombierki teammates girlfriends. After being released from prison he joined struggling Zagłębie Sosnowiec just three days later. Zagłębie who were in need of a solid defender, however after the time away from football Kliński also struggled for form, and he only played in 5 league matches, leaving midway through the season. After another six months away from football he joined KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, however likely because he was still under a contract with Zagłębie, he was blocked from appearing for the first team, resulting in Kliński going into coaching for a short time, where he coached with the KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski youth teams.\nAfter making only 5 league appearances over the space of 4 years, Kliński decided to move away from the Silesian region of Poland and that he needed a change of atmosphere for the good of his career. In 1975 he joined Arka Gdynia, then playing in the II liga. With Arka he regained his form and helped the club secure promotion back to the I liga by winning the league. Kliński formed a strong partnership with Zbyszek Bieliński. Despite being short for a defender, Kliński became a popular figure at Arka for his defensive abilities, penalty taking, and became the team captain, while earning the name \"Sheriff\" for how he controlled the defence. Back in the I liga, Kliński made a further 48 appearances in the top division, and scoreing 5 goals for Arka in the process. After only 3 years he left Arka being seen as one of the clubs greatest defenders.\nAfter leaving Arka he joined rivals Lechia Gdańsk for a season. Playing in the II liga, he made 17 league appearances for the club, and a further 2 in the Polish Cup. Despite Lechia finishing third in the league and reaching the quarter finals for the cup, he chose to leave at the end of the season. The final club of his career was Gryf Słupsk. He won promotion with Gryf during the 1980–81 season, securing second division football for the first time since the 1950s. Gryf also performed well the following season and had a chance of securing back-to-back promotions, and to play in the I liga for the first time in their history. However a scandal arose late in the season in Słupsk after Kliński was spotted talking to a former Szombierki teammate, and suspicion arose that Kliński may try to throw the game in the league leaders, GKS Katowice's, favour. He chose himself not to take part in the game against Katowice, but Gryf still lost the game, and effectively all chance of securing promotion. Kliński would go on to make only 9 more appearances for Gryf, before he retired from football. He played four seasons for Gryf, playing in the III liga and the II liga. In the II liga he made 32 appearances for the club, scoring 2 goals.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nDuring his early career Kliński featured many times for the youth sides of Poland. For the under-19's he made 13 appearances, making his debut against Czechoslovakia. He then progressed to the under-23's, making 7 appearances, with his debut coming against Sweden. He would also feature for the Poland B and Silesian U-23's national teams.\nKliński was also called up to the Poland national team for a tour of South America, however all of the fixtures on this tour were unofficial. He featured in games against a combined Club Alianza Lima and Club Universitario de Deportes team in Peru, and against Millonarios in Colombia. He would feature more times for Poland against Polish club opposition, but he never played in an official match for the Polish senior team.\n\n\n=== After football ===\nAfter retiring Kliński only ever attended matches as a fan, never taking on a role in football again. He continued to live in Gdynia after his retirement, and became a fan of Arka Gdynia. Before fully retiring he worked for Prasa-Książka-Ruch and as a post guard in post offices in Gdynia.\nKliński died on 22 April 2023. He is buried in the parish cemetery in Gdynia-Oksywie.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nSzombierki Bytom\n\nI liga: Winners: 1964–65\nArka Gdynia\n\nII liga: Winners: 1976–77\nGryf Słupsk\n\nII liga (gr.

        "content": "Good Girl (also known as I Love! Fairyland) is a graphic novel written and illustrated by Skottie Young that was released in five parts throughout 2017 by Image Comics as the third volume of the American comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe. Part 1, Con Girl, was released on March 15, 2017, Part 2, Lone Gert and Grub, was released on April 19, 2017, Part 3, Larry's Life was released on June 21, 2017, Part 4, Love's Labyrinth, was released on July 19, 2017, and Part 5, I Love! Fairyland, was released on August 16, 2017.\nThe series follows Gertrude \"Gert\", a young woman who has spent decades venturing through the candy-coated world of Fairyland on being transported there, trapped as her unageing six-year-old self with pretty green curls and a bow, and accompanied by her top-hat-wearing housefly quest companion Larry as she seeks a way to return home. After taking on a protégé, Maddie, Gert finally realizes that being such a murderous maniac might be the very reason she's never been able to find her way out of Fairyland, and sets off on a new quest to redeem herself, trying to earn her way back home with good deeds, kindness, love, and whatever other mushy, touchy-feely things she can manage to express. Preceded by Fluff My Life, it is followed by the story arc Sadly Never After, a crossover one-shot set between Fluff My Life and Good Girl, I Hate Image, published for Free Comic Book Day 2017, and an epilogue, \"I Hate Gert!\" by Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá, published for The Untold Tales of I Hate Fairyland in 2021.The series has received a universally positive critical reception.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\n\n=== Part One: Con Girl ===\nWhile Gert and Larry are taking a break from their normal questing and killing for some fun at Fairyland’s annual Dungeon Con, Gert is approached by a fangirl, Maddie, who seeks to become her protégé. After training Maddie in the ways of her life, Gert recognises through her what she has become over her decades in Fairyland, and resolves to be \"good\", to turn around her ways and finally leave Fairyland once and for all.\n\n\n=== Part Two: Lone Gert and Grub ===\nTired of being selfish and murderous, Gert decides to be a helpful member of the Fairyland society, starting off with rescuing a kidnapped baby and returning it to its loving family.The title is a reference to the 1970 manga series Lone Wolf and Cub.\n\n\n=== Part Three: Larry's Life ===\nLarry imagines what his life could have been like if he'd never met Gert.\n\n\n=== Part Four: Love's Labyrinth ===\nGert attempts to solve a treacherous maze to restore her childhood innocence and restore her hope of leaving Fairyland.The title is a reference to the 2006 dark fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth.\n\n\n=== Part Five: I Love! Fairyland ===\nHer innocence restored, a child once more in mind as well as body, Gert enjoys her new-found goodness as she proceeds to finally complete her original \"one-day quest\" in order to leave Fairyland once and for all.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nComicBookWire lauded Good Girl as \"just as wacky and humorous as previous volumes [and for] Gertrude's quest in this book giv[ing] a bit of nuance to each chapter\" with \"[e]verything in this book look[ing] fantastic and [being] incredibly detailed\", concluding to describe it as \"the best volume in this series so far. All of the best aspects of previous volumes return[ing] to create a book that is funny and ridiculous in its own unique way [while providing] just enough of a new twist to keep things interesting\", with SKJam! similarly lauding the series' \"change of direction [as] a welcome advance [to] the plot\". IGN praised the \"game-changing shift\" of the narrative, as well las Skottie Young's art for having the graphic novel \"remain[ing] one of the single prettiest books on stand and the only one I'll buy in trade, floppy, and digital. It's just so gorgeous, gang, it's just so, so pretty [and] the story is (almost) as good as the art. Hope it stays that way\".\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGood Girl at Image Comics",

        "content": "Madly Ever After is a graphic novel, written and illustrated by Skottie Young that was released in five parts throughout 2015 and 2016 by Image Comics, as the first volume of the American comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe. Part 1 was released on October 14, 2015, Part 2 was released on November 18, 2015, Part 3 was released on December 16, 2015, Part 4 was released on January 20, 2016, and Part 5 was released on February 17, 2016.\nFollowing Gertrude \"Gert\", a bitter, hard-drinking, sarcastic, murderous young woman who has spent the last twenty-seven years on a \"one-day quest\" through Fairyland on being transported there for the key that will allow her to go home, trapped as her unageing six-year-old self with pretty green curls and a bow, and accompanied by her equally sarcastic, top-hat-wearing housefly quest companion Larry. After the impatient Queen Cloudia decides to summon a second child, Happy, to take Gert's place, Gert must complete her quest before Happy lest she be trapped in Fairyland forever. It is followed by the story arc Fluff My Life.\nReceiving a universally positive critical reception, a coloring book adaptation of the volume was released on June 1, 2016.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn October 2015, Young stated the concept behind the volume was developed when he was working on 2009's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz limited series at Marvel Comics, with the idea that Dorothy would eventually \"be super annoyed by all these characters\", with Gert being an adult stuck in a child's body being inspired by Young's experiences as a new father, the overall tale described as an \"Adventure Time/Alice in Wonderland-style epic that smashes its cute little face against Tank Girl/Deadpool-esque violent madness\", Young describing the story arc's conception as:\n\n\"My initial plan with this, when I came up with this idea years ago, was it was just a 48-page little one-shot, and as I thought about it more, I actually thought, \"Oh, that 48-page one-shot is probably just the first little story in a sequence of a bunch of little tales of the girl who travels this world.\" Then it occurred to be more a vignette, which was basically just a bunch of short story, pretty similar to episodic television, where every episode you jump in, you learn more about a world, you travel, and every now and then you might have an arc. As I developed it more and more, and I turned that 48-page story into a five-issue story, but now that I know that the support's out there, and the retailers and the fans are behind it, and readers are behind it, I'm kind of leaning back into what it was always intended to be, which is a really episodic book about a girl stuck in this world. It's given me a chance to tell stories of different lands that are in this world and move away a little bit from the story on rails type of arc storytelling that we do sometimes. That way, similar to the way that I designed the world, I want to tell the stories as off the cuff and whimsical as I can think. If all of a sudden, mid-issue, while I'm working on issue six or seven or eight, an idea occurs to me of where to take them next, I can do that in the next issue, whereas with something that's a little more on rails and is heading towards the plot target… This is allowing me to really be a little bit more nimble with an overall idea in mind that I'm aiming for.\"\nIn June 2016, Young stated that \"originally I wanted to tell a story where Gert was a boy. I wanted to drop him in Fairyland and come back thirty years later, portraying him as a full grown man. That idea came from my love of Lobo and Tank Girl. The original elevator pitch was, essentially: “what if Lobo was in Wonderland?” However, as I developed that idea, the book started to veer too far away from humor and too far into brutality. The goal of I Hate Fairyland was not to tell a hyper-violent story, but to explore a world the character just sees as annoying. I turned the character in a woman and then a girl. I thought it would be funny to put a big axe into Alice's hand and have her act lead Deadpool. There’s a lot of humor to that!\", considering Gert a breakout character, in having initially intended to have the story past Madly Ever After eventually move beyond just her to other characters as a semi-interconnected anthology series, before electing to keep her the focus, with where Madly Ever After was \"the movie\", subsequent arcs would comprise \"the television series\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe first issue was released on October 14, 2015, seeing an estimated 50,300 copies and being the 42nd-best-selling issue of the month by units.\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Operation Tun Tun is the name coined by pro-government deputy Diosdado Cabello during the 2017 Venezuelan protests and repeated by pro-government media to describe the police raids of residences of Venezuelan opponents by security forces.\nA report by Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal documented at least six instances in which Venezuelan security forces raided residential areas and apartments in Caracas and in four different states. In some of the raids, which tended to occur near barricades built by protesters, security forces entered homes without search warrants, stealing personal belongings and food, and both beating and arresting residents.\n\n\n== Term ==\nIn the second hearing of the Organization of American States to analyze possible crimes against humanity in Venezuela, Major General Hebert García Plaza described Operation Tun Tun as an operation normally carried out at night, where a Bolivarian Intelligence Service commission visits the person and takes them away, possibly without an arrest warrant or issued by a Public Ministry prosecutor. When asked by the Argentine jurist Luis Moreno Ocampo about the origin of the name, García Plaza answered that although he did not know its origin and that \"one would have to ask Diosdado Cabello\", he supposed that it came from the sound emitted by the door when it is knocked by the security forces.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 17 May 2017, Diosdado Cabello assured during his television program Con el mazo dando that he would activate an operation called \"Tun Tun\" that night for people who imported implements for \"terrorists\", noting that the opposition \"is going to take more stick than a thieving cat\" and describing Voluntad Popular deputy Freddy Guevara as a \"drug addict\". Diosdado also threatened the shipping companies in the country, stating that \"they contribute with the transfer of supplies that are used by members of these violent groups to generate acts of vandalism and terrorism in Venezuela\" and declaring that the situation \"will be taken to the competent authorities to investigate these actions\", saying that shipping companies DHL, Liberty Express, Aduanera Las Dos L, Aduana Isacar and Economía Aduanera 2000 could be charged under the Anti-Terrorism Law.On 24 June, during a ceremony commemorating the Battle of Carabobo and Army Day, President Nicolás Maduro declared that all those detained in Operation Tun Tun were under military justice, and on 19 July Diosdado Cabello threatened, again in his program Con el mazo dando, the candidates to be appointed by the National Assembly as judges of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, after the judges appointed in 2015 with vices and irregularities by the outgoing ruling party majority of the National Assembly, saying: \"Let's see who will appoint you, who will defend you, to see if Julio Borges will defend you when the operation tuntun comes for you, let's see if they will defend you.\"On the morning of 30 April 2018, officers of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) raided the house of the relatives of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile judge Elenis Rodríguez, in Maturín, where they stole a computer equipment and where her mother, who had Alzheimer's disease, and a sister of the justice live, who was taken as a witness to testify but was released after several hours. In the rest of the country, similar procedures were carried out against properties of at least four other magistrates, including Miguel Angel Martin, who served as president of the Supreme Tribunal, and magistrates Cioly Zambrano, Tony Marval, and Pedro Troconis.On July 11, 2019, Diosdado threatened to apply Operation Tun Tun against diplomat Reinaldo Diaz Ohep. In 2020, the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Venezuela published a report on the COVID-19 pandemic where it warned that the peak of the outbreak in the country could reach 4,000 cases per day in June. Cabello responded to the report by threatening the academy, saying \"This is an invitation for security agencies to visit these people. It is an invitation to a tun tun\". The academy rejected the threats.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal documented at least six instances in which Venezuelan security forces raided residential areas and apartments in Caracas and in four different states. In some of these raids, which tended to occur near barricades built by protesters, security forces entered homes without search warrants, stealing personal belongings and food, and both beating and arresting residents.The deputy of the Legislative Council of the Bolívar state, Cesar Ramírez, witnessed the raid in the urbanizations of Villa Latina, Los Olivos and Los Mangos in Puerto Ordaz, where officers of the National Guard, military counter-intelligence and the Bolivarian Intelligence Service were present with sledgehammers, demolition equipment, firearms and even drums, breaking glass and main access doors and raiding residences. Ramirez described the actions of the officers as \"very far from what is a police operation\" and that rather \"it looked like a criminal operation with people in National Guard uniforms, hooded and with firearms causing destruction and running over a civilian population inside their homes, violating human rights\". Ramírez requested the Attorney General's Office to order a criminal investigation against governor Francisco Rangel Gómez, officials of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence and the Bolivarian National Guard for causing destruction to private property, raid of apartments without a court order and detaining a minor without an arrest warrant.Political scientist and editor of Aporrea Nicmer Evans described the operation as \"fascist\", denouncing that they knocked on his door to ask him about deputy Germán Ferrer, husband of the attorney general dismissed by the National Constituent Assembly, Luisa Ortega Díaz. In 2020, constitutionalist Joel Rodríguez Ramos declared that Operation Tun Tun \"presaged barbarism\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnforced disappearances in Venezuela\n2017 Venezuelan protests\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Jaffa in 1197 was a military engagement between the Ayyubid army and the Crusaders outside the city of Jaffa. The Crusaders were defeated and lost Jaffa in the end.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1195, the German king, Henry VI took the cross and launched a new crusade to the holy land. This time the Germans took a route by sea, avoiding the dangerous route his father has taken during the Third Crusade. Arnold of Lübeck states that the Germans had an army of 60,000, which is indeed an exaggeration; the Germans probably had a quarter of that number. A bulk of Germans arrived early in September while the main force stopped at Cyprus to crown Aimery. The German force made a raid into Galilee; however, they were surrounded by the Ayyubids led by Al-Adil, and only the intervention of King Henry saved them.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nSoon, Al-Adil left Acre and headed towards Jaffa, as the truce of 1192 had ended. The city of Jaffa was ruled by Renauld Barlais. The Crusaders, probably out of rashness, marched out of Jaffa and went to meet the Ayyubids. The Crusaders attacked the Muslims; however, the Ayyubids fought back against them and put them on the run. The Crusaders retreated from the battlefield towards Jaffa again. However, the Crusaders found the gates to be shut. The garrison closed the gates out of fear of a potential attack on the city. All the crusaders outside were subsequently massacred. The Ayyubids then laid siege to the city.\nThe Ayyubids assaulted the walls and forced the garrison to retreat. The defense was weak. The Crusaders were forced to retreat to the citadel, but the Ayyubids managed to breach it and kill all the defenders inside. King Henry heard the news of this attack and dispatched his army to relieve the city; however, on September 10, in an unexpected accident, Henry fell from a window and died. At the same time, Jaffa had already fallen to the Ayyubids, and upon hearing the death of their king, the Crusader relief army withdrew.\nThe Ayyubids destroyed the city, took lots of spoils and captives, and left.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe city of Jaffa remained in Muslim hands until 1204, when it was returned to the Crusaders as part of a truce agreed with Al-Adil. But despite it's return, it remained deserted until 1228.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJean Richard (1979), The Latin Kingdom Of Jerusalem, Volume A.[1]\nChristopher Tyerman (2007), God's War, A New History of the Crusades.[2]\nGraham Loud (2019), The Chronicle of Arnold of Lübeck, 1st Edition.\nChristopher Marshall (1994), Warfare in the Latin East, 1192–1291.

That is, the ballot is taken in two rounds, if no one reaches at least an absolute majority of the valid votes, a second round between the two most voted candidates will be held. All the candidates holding executive posts had to renounce till April 2, 2006 in order to be able to run.\nThe candidates for Governor of São Paulo were, in no particular order:\n\nThe Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) – was the governing party, though the incumbent governor Geraldo Alckmin had taken over after the death of Mário Covas.\nWorkers' Party (PT) – the main opposition party in the state chose José Genoíno, a Federal Deputy and former Guerrilla fighter as its candidate.\nBrazilian Progressive Party (PPB) chose former governor Paulo Maluf as its candidate\nBrazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) – chose Federal Deputy Lamartine Posella as its candidate.\nOther candidates included Carlos Apolinário (PGT).\n\n\n== References ==",

He supported the policy of Aristide Briand to maintain peace and was among the earliest to recognise the danger of Nazi Germany. His opposition to German propaganda caused conflict with his directors, who favoured collaboration. During the Battle of France in 1940, Bois was asked by Le Petit Parisien's management to publish a statement proclaiming that as editor he had followed a personal policy, which he refused. He subsequently ceased to be the paper's editor.\nDuring the French collapse in June 1940, Bois sought refuge in Britain, where he worked for the Free France movement. He authored Truth on the Tragedy of France, which analysed France's defeat.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It is included in Article 137c of Title V of the Dutch Criminal Code, which includes crimes against public order.\nInsulting a group of people is a form of punishable insult and is considered a form of expression offence  The crime is distinguished from other offenses of insult, not by the content of the insult, but by the link between the expression and specific group characteristics. There is insult to a group of people if someone makes deliberately insulting statements about a group of people in public, orally or in writing or images, because of their race, their religion or belief, their heterosexual or homosexual orientation or their physical, psychological or intellectual disability. The rationale for criminalization is partly to prevent disruption of the public debate and the prevention of disturbances.\nInsulting a group is closely related to the incitement to hatred, discrimination or violence contained in Article 137d. Article 137e of the Criminal Code contains the offense of disseminating group insults.",

It was the church of a former priory dependent on the Abbey of La Chaise-Dieu before becoming a collegiate church.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe parish church of Notre-Dame in Langeac was destroyed in 1430. The Church of Saint-Gal then became the parish church. It is likely that during this period, the bays of the nave of the current church were built. This reconstruction is probably attributed to Jacques de Langeac, who had to abandon his religious orders to take up the barony of Langeac.\nThe year 1460 is engraved on the portal of the main façade. In 1488, the chapter of canons was definitively constituted by the bishop of Saint-Flour. The choir stalls were completed in 1526. Langeac was annexed to the diocese of Le Puy-en-Velay in 1823. This church has been classified as a historical monument since September 16, 1907. Several items are referenced in the Palissy database.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It was led by public health administrator Raphael Cilento.\nAhead of the 1953 Senate election, the party merged with the New South Wales-based Democratic Party of Australia (DPA). However, they split following the election. The party was also separate from the North Queensland Democratic Party.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party merged with the Democratic Party several months before the 1953 Senate election, with the DPA's Charles Russell (a former Country Party MP) saying the decision was made because both parties had similar aims and ideologies. The party endorsed Cilento as its lead candidate in Queensland. Not long after the Senate election, which saw the Democratic ticket fail to win a seat, the parties split.\nAt the 1954 federal election, Cilento ran as the IDP's candidate in the division of McPherson, held by Country Party leader Arthur Fadden. He was unsuccessful, receiving 34% of the vote.\n\n\n== Policies ==\nThe party pledged to \"restore representative government\" in Australia, with Cilento criticising the two-party-system and stating that \"uncontrolled competition between parties, and machine politics generally, can only lead to totalitarianism\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In Good Company is an album by the American musician Joe Williams, released in 1989. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male\". Williams supported the album with a North American tour. In Good Company peaked in the top five of Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart.\n\n\n== Production ==\nWilliams duetted with Marlena Shaw on Louis Jordan's \"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby\" and \"Baby You Got What It Takes\", the song made famous by Dinah Washington and Brook Benton. \"Just Friends\" is a version of the John Klenner and Sam M. Lewis song. Shirley Horn sang on \"Too Good to Be True\" and \"Love Without Money\". Williams was backed by Supersax on \"Embraceable You\" and \"Just Friends\". Henry Johnson played guitar on the album; Norman Simmons contributed on piano. Williams was still capable of moving through three vocal octaves.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Los Angeles Times praised \"Williams's consistently potent sound.\" USA Today noted his \"sinuous range and meaty bass.\" The Ottawa Citizen called the album \"an engaging collection but not one that stands close scrutiny,\" but admired the version of \"Ain't Got Nothing but the Blues\". The Washington Post labeled it \"one of the best jazz vocal albums of the year,\" writing that Williams \"has lost a bit of his range and power, but ... he has honed his phrasing to such a sharp edge that the most familiar standard becomes a starkly personal statement.\" The Boston Globe said that Williams \"carries the weight here with great style and polished grace.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Williams shows that at 70 he still had the magic.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It stands in an area of fields and low hills to the south of Llandegla-yn-Iâl (today's south-east Denbighshire), Wales.\nThis, it seems, was the 'Castell yn Iâl' (castle of Yale) built by Owain Gwynedd in 1149, according to the Chronicle of the Princes, when he seized the hundred of Ial from the kings of Powys. That first castle stood until 1157 when it was burnt down by Iorwerth Goch ap Maredudd (Iorwerth Goch) of Powys following a raid by Henry II of England on Gwynedd. There is another record in an English document from 1212 which refers to the repair of 'Yale castle', but it is likely that another castle in the same area is meant, namely Tomen y Faerdre, 3 miles down the valley near Llanarmon-yn-Iâl.\n\nThe castle stands on private land but can be seen from the A525 road between Wrexham and Ruabon, about a mile and a half south-west of Llandegla.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRichard Avent, Cestyll Tywysogion Cymru (Caerdydd, 1983)\nPaul R.

        "content": "Henry Hanna (4 January 1871 – 21 March 1946) was an Irish barrister and later High Court judge, author, and photographer. Hanna was born to a Belfast-based  Presbyterian merchant family on 4 January 1871. He was educated at the Belfast Royal Academy, Queen's University, and London University.  \nHe became eye-witness to two key events, the Landing at Suvla Bay - about which he wrote his book \"The Pals at Suvla Bay\" - and the 1916 Easter Rising where we wrote diaries that have been described as a \"litany of alarms and rumours circulating around the city, interspersed with his eyewitness accounts of events in his neighbourhood\".\n\n\n== Legal career ==\nIn 1896, he was admitted to the Irish Bar and became part of the old North-East Circuit. Hanna came to be considered the authority on the Workmen's Compensation Act and its revisions and published his work, \"The law of workmen's compensation : with the Irish rules and forms\" in 1907. In 1911, he achieved the status of a silk barrister and became King's Counsel and, two years later, was called to the English Bar.  As a lawyer, Hanna faced the challenge of managing a substantial caseload due to his successful advocacy, including the defence of James Larkin's co-accused (Larkin opted to defend himself) and, despite his own unionist stance, several Irish Republicans, such as Sean MacEntee and Denis McCullough. He spent several years working on the Irish Law Times with William John Johnston, where he mastered Pitman's shorthand. He served as a member of the Executive Committee of the International Academy of Comparative Law at the Hague. During the Great War, he was made chairman of the Maritime Board, and in 1919 was made Serjeant-at-law. In 1925 and assumed the role of a judge in the Free State High Court, a position he held until his resignation in 1943. During this time, he presided over several notable cases, including: the Seamus Clandillon libel trial (the longest libel action in the history of the Irish courts at the time, running from 29 October to 14 November 1928), the action by the Lynch family following the Copley Street Riot, and the murder trial of those accused of murdering Noel Lemass (brother of Seán Lemass). He was treasurer of the the Honorable Society of King's Inns for 1927 and 1928.\n\n\n== Easter Rising ==\nDuring the Easter Rising, a period he referred to as 'Black Easter Week', Hanna, then a resident of the city, chronicled a series of alarms and rumours that swept through the streets. His personal experiences were intertwined with the unfolding events in his neighbourhood.\nOn Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, Hanna was on manoeuvres in the Dublin mountains with his battalion of the Volunteer Training Corps, known as the \"Gorgeous Wrecks\" (a pun on the name of the King, Georgius Rex), when they got word that the city was in the \"hands of the rebels\". Their attempts to return to Beggars Bush Barracks brought them directly into the line of sniper fire resulting in casualties. Eye-witness testimony written in The Kildare Observer, and Eastern Counties Advertiser on 6 May 1916 states:\n\n\"I am myself a member of the Veteran Corps, known in the city as the “Gorgeous Wrecks” (G.R.)... The rifles they have are of an antique pattern. They have no ammunition to use with the rifles—there is not a bullet in Dublin that would fit them, and under these circumstances I refused as I say to invite attack parading useless, antedeluvian [sic] weapons. The G.R’s went for a route march on Monday. When the outbreak occurred I was sent to warn them, but they reached Northumberland Street at the same time as did. I was still some distance from the Corps when the rebels opened fire on them from the houses. Four were shot dead and fifteen were seriously wounded. There was, of course, no attempt at defence, and the members of the Corps who escaped took shelter anywhere they could get it. Four of them very pluckily attempted to attend to the wounds of their fallen comrades, and carried some of them to shelter while under fire.\"\nHanna recognised the immediate danger of being on the street in his uniform and headed for his home at 54 Lansdowne Road. The proximity of Hanna's home to Lansdowne Road station afforded a view, from his attic, from which he could survey the rebel forces as they dug trenches across the railway line, effectively, per Hanna, severing access to the city. The stretch between Lansdowne Road Station and Bath Avenue Bridge became a focal point of rebel activity.\nAmidst the chaos, Hanna worked to procure essential supplies for the troops defending Beggars Bush Barracks. Bread and tins of bully beef were sourced, even as the situation grew increasingly precarious. Matters escalated when the rebels commandeered the neighbouring house, heightening the risk of being caught in the crossfire.\nOn Thursday, April 27, Hanna faced one of the fiercest days of fighting. A near miss—a bullet whizzing past his head—served as a stark reminder of the danger. Residents along Lansdowne Road witnessed the relentless bombardment during daylight hours, seeking refuge on their own doorsteps. At night, the safest place to rest was on the floor, away from stray bullets.\nAs food supplies dwindled by Thursday, tales of looting permeated the city. The surrender of the Four Courts on Saturday, 29 April, marked a turning point, although skirmishes continued in the suburbs. Hanna's enduring memories of the Rebellion included the city aflame at night, the thunderous cannonade, nerve-wracking sniper fire, and an unwavering compulsion to engage with neighbours and understand the unfolding events.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nHanna's political affiliations aligned with Lord Middleton, the Rt. Hon. Andrew Jameson (who had created the Irish Unionist Anti-Partition League), and other Southern Unionists who sought reconciliation with Sinn Féin in 1921. \nHe ran in the 1918 Irish general election on behalf of the Irish Unionist Alliance in the Dublin St Stephen's Green constituency, but came a distant third to Thomas Kelly of Sinn Féin. Writing in the Irish Independent on 30 November 1918 as a part of this campaign, Hanna voiced opposition to partition which 'would be disastrous to the interests of Southern Unionists'.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nBeyond the courtroom, Hanna's interests extended to photography, he was made vice-president of the Photographic Society of Ireland, and canine expertise, he served as the president of the Irish Kennel Club for several years. His written contributions included legal treatises, but it was his book, \"The Pals at Suvla Bay,\" documenting the experiences of the 7th Royal Dublin Fusiliers during the 1915 campaign at Suvla Bay, that showed what his obituary described as his \"passion not only for accuracy but for good writing\".\nFrom 1930 to 1931 he was president of the Ulster Medical Society.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2015, the National Museum of Ireland staged a theatre show that focused on the fate of the 7th company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, young Irishmen who were sent to fight in the disastrous Allied assault on Gallipoli in 1915. The creators drew heavily on the book 'Pals at Suvla Bay', a memorial written by Hanna upon his return from the war, as well as other historical texts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The tomb of Xu Guangqi is the burial site of Xu Guangqi (24 April 1562 – 10 November 1633), a prominent late Ming dynasty statesman, scholar, and leader of the Catholic community, as well as some of his relatives. It is located north of Xujiahui, Shanghai, in the present-day Guangqi Park, covering an area of 3,000 square meters and standing 2.2 meters tall. The tomb is elliptical in shape.\nIn the seventh year of the Chongzhen era (1634), he was posthumously granted the privilege of burial with the rank of a first-rank official, and a special envoy was dispatched to escort his coffin back to Shanghai for burial. Due to the unsettled situation at the time, the coffin was temporarily placed outside the Da'nan Gate of Shanghai (Old City) in the Shuangyuan Villa. In the fourteenth year of the Chongzhen era (1641), he was finally buried in the southwest corner of Gaochang Township, Shanghai County, Songjiang Prefecture.\nIn the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu era (1903), the Catholic Vicariate of Kiang-nan renovated and expanded the tomb. It was once abandoned, even turned into a vegetable garden. In 1957, it was briefly rebuilt.: 210  During the Cultural Revolution, it became an open-air warehouse and was severely damaged. It was once again restored in 1983. In 2003, it was reconstructed according to the tomb's design from 1903 and has since been well-maintained.\nOn 26 May 1959, and 7 December 1977, the tomb of Xu Guangqi was declared a cultural relic protection unit of Shanghai. On 13 January 1988, it was announced as a national major cultural relic protection unit by the State Council.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n\nXu Guangqi, a native of Shanghai County, Songjiang Prefecture, Nanzhili, in the late Ming dynasty, passed the imperial examination in the 32nd year of the Wanli era (1604) and held the highest official position as the Director of the Ministry of Rites and concurrently the Grand Secretary of the Hall of Literary Profundity. He studied astronomy, calendar, mathematics, and firearms with the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. He presented several astronomical and mathematical works to the Ming Emperor, along with contributions in military strategy, salt administration, land reclamation, and hydraulic engineering. Xu Guangqi's significant contributions to east–west cultural exchange earned him the title \"the first person in China to truly open his eyes to the world\", as described by Professor Mao Peiqi. In the sixth year of the Chongzhen era (1633), Xu Guangqi passed away at the age of 72. A special guard was dispatched by the Ming government to escort Xu Guangqi's remains back to Shanghai, arriving in his hometown in the second month of the seventh year of the Chongzhen era (1634).: 70  Eventually, Xu Guangqi was buried at the junction of Zhaojiabang and Fahuajing, known as the Tomb of Xu Guangqi. One of his descendants later settled near the tomb, and the area was named \"Xujiahui\" (\"property of the Xu family at the junction of two rivers\").: 65 \n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nOriginally covering more than 20 mu, Xu Guangqi's tomb had two huabiao (ornamental columns) in front of it, as well as a stone archway. Stone statues of sheep, horses, and elderly figures were placed on both sides of the tomb path. In the 29th year of the Guangxu era (1903), the huabiao of Xu Guangqi's tomb had disappeared.: 62  Due to Xu Guangqi's Catholic faith during his lifetime, the Catholic Church erected a cross in commemoration of the 270th anniversary of Xu Guangqi's passing. Inscriptions in Chinese and Latin on the base of the cross describe Xu Guangqi's achievements,: 71  and the tomb was renovated simultaneously. In 1933, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Xu Guangqi's passing, different communities raised funds to build an iron fence around the cross, as well as stone railings and cement roads around the cemetery. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the trees in the vicinity were heavily felled, the soil was excavated, and the cemetery was turned into vegetable fields.: 71 \n\n\n=== Present ===\nIn 1956, eight influential figures from the direct lineage of Xu Guangqi and the Xu clan wrote to the Shanghai People's Committee expressing their willingness to entrust Xu Guangqi's tomb to the state for safekeeping. Subsequently, Xu Guangqi's tomb was placed under the management of the Shanghai Cultural Bureau. In 1957, the tomb underwent restoration, and residents who had been cultivating vegetables in the cemetery were relocated elsewhere. Apart from the portion of land occupied by the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau staff area, the rest of the area was restored to its original state, with trees replanted within the cemetery.: 71  The surrounding area was transformed into the Nandan Park.: 93  During the Cultural Revolution, most of the landmark buildings in the cemetery were destroyed, including the rebuilt huabiao, stone archway, and stone statues, all of which were smashed, and the cemetery was converted into an open-air warehouse. In 1975, the cemetery was reclaimed by the Shanghai Municipal Gardens Department in collaboration with the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee and underwent renovation.: 71 \nIn 1980, mathematician Su Buqing inscribed a tombstone for Xu Guangqi, which was erected in front of Xu Guangqi's tomb. In 1981, the burial mound was reconstructed, and dragon cypress and evergreen trees were planted on both sides. In 1983, Xu Guangqi's tomb was again restored. Approximately 15 meters in front of the tomb, a granite statue of Xu Guangqi wearing the robes of a first-rank official, half bust, 1.2 meters high, with a pedestal 1.6 meters high, was erected. A new stele corridor was built on the east side,: 65  and a 150-square-meter granite tomb platform was constructed on the small road in front of the tomb. A large number of trees were planted around the tomb, and several stone benches were placed. In April 2012, two commemorative stone tablets were erected at Xu Guangqi's tomb, each inscribed with articles commemorating Xu Guangqi by Ruan Yuan and Chu Coching; in addition, two sculptures related to Xu Guangqi were also erected at the same time.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe tomb of Xu Guangqi is located on the north side of Guangqi Park, covering an area of 3000 square meters. There are a total of 10 tombs in the cemetery. The main tomb houses Xu Guangqi and his wife, Madam Wu, while his four grandsons and their wives are buried on both sides. After the 1983 renovation, the height of the burial mound reached 2.2 meters with an area of 300 square meters, elliptical in shape, surrounded by granite paving. Green grass is planted on the burial mound, while large camphor trees, dragon cypresses, cedar trees, and oleanders are planted in front of the tomb. A tombstone stands in front, inscribed with \"Tomb of Xu Guangqi\" in the handwriting of mathematician Su Buqing. Stone benches are placed on both sides, and on the right side of the tomb, a Qing Dynasty stone horse is preserved.\nAdditionally, there is another stone horse, as well as pairs of stone sheep, stone elephants, and stone dogs, and a cross. On the east side of the tomb, there is a stele corridor built in 1983. Originally a resting pavilion in the park, it was renovated to have a wall in the middle, with 12 inscribed stone tablets, featuring Xu Guangqi's portrait, the biography of Xu Guangqi written by Zha Jizuo at the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the first sentence of Xu Guangqi's handwriting preface to the \"Introduction to Geometry\", and a poem by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Qi handwritten by Xu Guangqi. In front of the tomb, there is a memorial archway with three bays and four columns, with the inscription \"Tomb of the Late Great Scholar and Prince Tutor, Posthumously Honored as Grand Guardian and Further Honored as Grand Guardian, Minister of Rites, and Concurrent Grand Secretary of the Hall of Literary Profundity, Xu Wending's Tomb\". The archway also has couplets inscribed, with the upper couplet reading \"Master of Calendar and Agriculture for Hundreds of Generations, Guiding Heaven and Earth\", and the lower couplet reading \"From General to Minister, an official devoted to military affairs and scholarly pursuits\".\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nOn 26 May 1959, and 7 December 1977, the tomb of Xu Guangqi was successively declared a cultural heritage site in Shanghai. On 13 January 1988, the tomb of Xu Guangqi was announced by the State Council as one of the third batch of nationally major protected cultural relics. In 2003, the tomb of Xu Guangqi was designated as a patriotism education base in Shanghai. Since then, the Education Bureau, Cultural Bureau, and other units of Xuhui District in Shanghai have organized memorial ceremonies at the tomb of Xu Guangqi every Qingming Festival. Sometimes there are offerings of flower baskets and speeches on related commemorative themes.\nIn 2003, the South Chunhua Hall, a cultural heritage site in Meilong, Xuhui District, was converted into the Xu Guangqi Memorial Hall. The memorial hall covers an area of more than 400 square meters, with an exhibition area of over 220 square meters. It features four exhibition themes, displaying valuable materials such as portraits, manuscripts, and documents related to Xu Guangqi.\nIn 2006, the contents of the lost epitaph of Xu Guangqi's tomb were discovered in a magazine published in 1920. Based on the Latin content of the epitaph on the tombstone, it was inferred that Xu Guangqi had indeed converted to Catholicism and had taken the baptismal name \"Paul\". In 2007, the tombstone of Xu Guangqi's tomb was accidentally discovered buried under the soil of the tomb, with an area of about 1 square meter and some damage in the upper right corner. After this discovery, the tombstone was placed in a flower bed in Guangqi Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTomb of Lu Xun\nTomb of Soong Ching-Ling\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Shanghai\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n徐家汇源. \"徐光启墓 景点介绍\" (in Chinese).

        "content": "Melgunov Kurgan (Ukrainian: Мельгунівський курган), also known as Lyta Grave (Ukrainian: Лита могила), is one of the oldest Scythian kurgans (burial mounds) from 7th century BC.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe kurgan was excavated in September 1763 near the village of Kopani (nowadays located in Kropyvnytskyi Raion, Kirovohrad Oblast). The work was carried out on the instructions of Oleksiy Melgunov (after which the kurgan was named), who would later become the general governor of Novorossiya Governorate. It was investigated by Vladimir Yastrebov in 1892 and Ninel Bokiy in 1990. Excavations were also done by Y. Boltryk in 2019. Information about the excavations is fragmentary and contradictory.\nIt was established that the kurgan was built in 7th century BC and modified in 4th century BC. The mound is about 10.5 m tall. The kurgan consists of burnt slagged soil with the remains of melted metals, burnt bones, stones, earth, and clay mixed with coal. The use of fire was a part of the funeral rite.\nGolden jewelry and sword decorations were found in the kurgan, and they are currently stored in Hermitage Museum and Kharkiv Historical Museum (although a large part of the collection was destroyed during World War II bombings). At the depth of 2 m, multiple items were found under stone slabs: an acinaces with a golden hilt and a gold-plated wooden scabbard decorated with images of fantastic animals, a golden diadem, silver details of an Assyrian palace stool, 17 gold plates depicting an eagle with hinges on the back, a plate with images of monkeys and birds, a bronze clasp with images of lion heads, 40 bronze arrowheads, rings, and other objects. The items did not have any traces of fire.\n\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe site has outstanding significance, as it is the only known Scythian royal mound of the time in the Northern Black Sea region. In 2020, the kurgan's mound was restored and a memorial sign was installed. The image of the eagle from the golden plates found in the kurgan is depicted on the coat of arms of Kirovohrad Oblast.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bezor Doul or Bez Doul is a historical monument located at Bezor pothar in the Dhemechi area of Dibrugarh district. It is situated about 5 km from Dimow town of Sivasagar district. The Bezor Doul is a Vishnu Doul and is built with an octagonal sanctuary and a steep gap. It is an example of late medieval brick temple architecture from the Ahom period. During the Ahom era, a traditional medicine practitioner of Chung Khel received the title of Bezbarua for his efficiency. He was granted vast lands by the Ahom kings in the present-day Bezor pothar area. The doul was constructed by the Ahom king Rudra Singha in his memory. The walls of this small doul are quite thick. Various flower jali works adorned the walls of the doul, but they are no longer present. There are no idols in this doul, but Vishnu is still worshipped here. The Archaeological Department of the Government of Assam has recognized the Bezor Doul as a State Protected Monument.\n\n\n== Location ==\nBezor Doul, also known as Bez Doul, is located in Bezor p othar in the Dhemechi area of Dibrugarh district. It is an ancient monument from the Ahom era, situated about 5 km from Dimow in Sivasagar district.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the Ahom era, a traditional medicine practitioner (Bez) of the Chung Khel promoted and received the title of Bezbaruah for his excellent medical treatment to the Royal family. He was granted vast tracts of land in the area of present-day Bezor Pathar (Fields of the Bez) by the Ahom kings. The Bez Daul was built by Swargadeo Rudra Singha in memory of that Bezbarua. Some believe that Bezbarua built the doul himself. Later, the doul became known as Bez Doul or Bezor Doul.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAt present, the Bezor Doul and a large area around it are protected by concrete walls. The doul is very beautiful in appearance, and its walls are quite thick. This doul is identified as a Vishnu Doul from its top of its peak. Although there are no idols inside the doul, lord vishnu is still worshipped here. The Bezor Doul is an octagonal sanctuary with a steep background. It is a late medieval brick monument from the Ahom dynasty.\nThe entrance to the Jagmohan of Bezor Doul is on the west side. The canopy of Jagmohan is bow-shaped, with a cap in the middle and the top in the shape of a Majubandhani. The canopy is connected by two roofs up to the jangha. Antarala is built with an inverted U shaped entrance. The walls of the doul are quite thick, with a gabaksha on the wall and one kundraksha on top of the gabaksha. The inner area is conical and well-structured. There are no sculptures here.\nThe doul was formerly decorated jali works with flowers and leaves from bottom to top. The carvings were iroded away from the body of the temple over time. The middle part of the jangha is shaped like a slightly swollen drum from the outside. The shikhara of the doul is in the shape of a banana flower and slightly elevated to the north. The Kalasha at the top resembles a lotus flower bud, and the Sri Chakra is placed on the Kalasha as a weapon.\n\n\n== Location ==\nBezor Doul, also known as Bez Doul, is located in Bezor p othar in the Dhemechi area of Dibrugarh district. It is an ancient monument from the Ahom era, situated about 5 km from Dimow in Sivasagar district. It is well-connected by transportation from Moranhat and Dimow town. Maranhat railway station is about 21 km away and Dibrugarh Airport is about 60 km away from it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oleksandr Anatoliyovych Kapinos (Ukrainian: Олекса́ндр Анато́лійович Капіно́с; 10 March 1984 – 19 February 2014) was a Ukrainian farmer and political activist who is posthumously awarded the Hero of Ukraine in 2014. He is a member of the Svoboda party and took part in the clashes of Revolution of Dignity which resulted in his death. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 10 March 1984, in the Ukrainian village of Dunaiiv. Kapinos graduated with a major in carpentry technique at the Ukrainian State Forestry University in Lviv (now the Ukrainian National Forestry University) in 2006, after completing his hometown school. One of the top pupils, he served a Polish internship. Working in Vinnytsia, he was the leader of the nationalist group Skolota in the area from 2008 to 2009. He went back to Ternopil Oblast in 2009 and started farming there.  \n\n\n== Career ==\nKapinos supported Ukrainian culture, restoration of customs, and was an engaged member of the community. He was the leader of the Patriot Volyn advocacy group. Together with starting sports organizations in the community, organizing musical groups, and leading local choirs, he was also an organizer of cultural and creative events for youth. Volunteered in summer camps for the underprivileged. He was the first to call for the removing of Soviet emblems from his hometown village and started the process of erecting a memorial honoring Taras Shevchenko.\nAdditionally, Kapinos was the driving force behind the first memorial in the region to be built in the village of Kulikiv, honoring those who fought for Ukraine's independence. He attended Ukrainian Insurgent Army marches and traveled to Kyiv annually for the Feast of the Intercession. He actively participated in the Orange Revolution in 2004. He took part in the Maidan Nezalezhnosti demonstration in Kyiv in 2012, when he was among the first to declare an indefinite hunger strike in opposition to a bill that intended to suppress the Ukrainian language.\nEarly in 2012, Kapinos stood up for the liberties of the locals and stopped a development that would have devastated the Kremenets Mountains' ecosystem from being built on his native Danube. He later took part in the Revolution of Dignity. He landed in Kyiv at the end of November 2013, just as Euromaidan was getting underway. He joined the 35th hundred Volynska Sich under the pseudonym Flint when Maidan Self-Defense was established. Against overwhelming odds, he and his team held the Trade Unions Building on 18 February 2014, during the evening attack on the Maidan.\nIt was around 10 p.m. when he sustained a head wound, severing an artery. After being transported to the Kyiv City Clinical Emergency Hospital, he underwent surgery there. The wound proved to be too serious, and he passed away at 09:37 on 19 February 2014. On 20 February, the Holy Liturgy was conducted at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ternopil on the day of sorrow in honor of those who were killed during the protests in Kyiv; including Kapinos and Ustym Holodnyuk. He was later buried in his village of Danube in Ternopil Oblast.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKapinos was a bandura, accordion and guitarist. Following the Revolution of Dignity, his marriage to his girlfriend Olena Kotlyar was arranged. She stated that he died with the hope that his objectives will be met and that Ukraine will be pleased with its sons.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nA memorial plaque honoring Kapinos was formally opened on 10 March, at Kulykiv, Kremenets Raion. On 24 August 2014, Independence Day, a monument in Dunaiv honoring the Hero of the Heavenly Hundred was unveiled, featuring his statue. 2014 saw the naming of a Dunaiiv street in his' honor. On 10 March 2016, his birthday, a commemorative plaque in Vinnytsia was unveiled. On his close friend and regional council deputy Volodymyr Bartsyos's suggestion, it was put in his household. A memorial plaque was also erected at the building no. 2 of the Ukrainian National Forestry University.\nKapinos has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the Golden Star (posthumously; 21 November 2014)\n Medal \"For Sacrifice and Love for Ukraine\" (posthumously; 4 July 2015)\nHonorary Diploma of the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Kyiv (posthumously; 8 May 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Compositional game theory is a branch of game theory and computer science, which aims to present large complex games as a composition of simple small games.\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nA major theme in computer science is the ability to construct simple building-blocks (e.g. functions or procedures in a programming language), and compose them into larger structures (e.g. more complex functions or programs). This principle is also called modularity.\nIn contrast, in classic game theory, even complex games are treated as single, monolithic objects. This makes the analysis of games hard to scale.\nCompositional game theory (CGT) aims to apply the modularity principle to game theory. The main motivation is to make it easier to analyze large games using software tools.\n\n\n== Higher-order game ==\nA higher-order simultaneous game is a generalization of a Simultaneous game in which players are defined by selection functions rather than by utility functions. Formally, a higher-order simultaneous game for n players contains the following elements:\n\nA set R of outcomes.\nFor each player i, a set Xi of choices (possible actions).\nWe define Σ as the Cartesian product of all Xi, and call it the set of strategy profiles.\nAn outcome function, from Σ to R. This function determines, for each combination of actions of the players, what the outcome will be.\nFor each player i, there is a selection function denoted di. The selection function takes as input a context, which is a function from Xi to R; and returns a set of best-responses, which is a subset of Xi.\nThe term \"higher-order\" comes from the latter element. The best-response correspondence of each player is a higher-order function, as is input is itself a function. Every strategy-profile s1 in Σ, defines for each player i a function from Xi to R: the function maps each possible action xi in Xi to the outcome that would result if all players except i play as in s1, whereas player i switches his action to xi. In other words, s1 defines the context in which player i operates.\nGiven two strategy-tuples s1 and s2 in Σ, we say that s2 is a best-response to s1 if, for each player i, s2,i is contained in the output of di on the context generated by s1. The best-response relation is a binary relation contained in Σ x Σ, denoted by B.\nIn a standard game, instead of the selection function, there is a utility function ui for each player i. A utility function takes as input an outcome from R, and returns a real number. Such a game can be represented as a higher-order game as follows. For each player i, the selection function returns the set of actions from Xi that maximize the utility of agent i, given the context. \n\n\n== Open games ==\nThe main object of study in CGT is the open game. An open game has the following elements:\n\nA set X of observations;\nA set Y of outcomes;\nA set Σ of strategy profiles.\nA play function P, which is a function from Σ x X to Y;\nA coplay function C, which is a function from Σ x X x R to S;\nA best-response function B, which is a function from X x (Y -> R) to a relation in Σ x Σ.\nIt is an abstraction of a higher-order game. \nOpen games can be decomposed in two ways:\n\nIn sequence - yielding a sequential game;\nIn parallel - yielding a simultaneous game.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBayesian open games.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOpen game engine - Haskell code for constructing and analyzing open games.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sanctioning Evil is an 2022 American action-thriller film written by Kyle Travis Sharp and directed by Ante Novakovic. The film stars Tobias Truvillion, Zach McGowan and Taryn Manning. The film follows Staff sergeant Reginald Barnes (Truvillion), a recently discharged Army veteran who finds his way back into society via congressman Ambrose (McGowan). The film was shot in New York and New Jersey in late 2020.\nThe film was released on October 7, 2022, by Vertical Entertainment. \n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm critic Jim Morazzini from Voices from the Balcony gave in 1 of 5 stars writing: \"Talky and dull with a plot that relies on coincidence Sanctioning Evil is an overlong mess that could have been a solid revenge-based action film. Or an interesting conspiracy film. Or a thriller about political corruption. Instead, it incorporates bits of all three and comes out with a mess complete with a sanctimonious quote from the Bible to justify it all.” \nNelson Acosta from Fiction Horizon gave it 8/10 and praised the performances writing: \"when the film gets going, it ends up becoming this fascinating exploration of morals in a world that doesn’t want anything to do with them. The film also goes for an ending that feels the complete opposite of what other films are doing. Some might find it anticlimactic, but Sanctioning Evil goes for it and makes the film worth watching.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSanctioning Evil at IMDb \nSanctioning Evil at Rotten Tomatoes",

It was initially named Electricity Market Center (SMK) and before the most recent name change, Energy Market Authority (EMV).\nThe Energy Authority's tasks include monitoring the pricing of the electricity transmission grid and natural gas markets, and maintaining Finland's national emission trading registry. The agency also provides information on electricity prices to consumers to support the competition of electricity suppliers. Additionally, the Energy Authority oversees the implementation of electricity origin guarantees, ensuring that the amount of energy sold to consumers by energy companies, such as wind energy, is produced by wind power. The Energy Authority also administers the renewable energy feed-in tariffs that came into effect in 2011.\nElectricity transmission in Finland is a natural monopoly, managed by regional transmission companies. The Energy Authority oversees these companies to ensure they do not abuse their monopoly position and overcharge their customers.\nRegarding emissions trading, the Energy Authority grants and monitors emissions permits, oversees the implementation of emissions trading, approves emissions verifiers, and acts as the auctioneer of emission allowances in Finland.\nIn early 2014, the Energy Authority adopted its current name and assumed tasks related to energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment. At that time, the Energy Authority employed 70 people. Simo Nurmi has been the Director-General since April 2015.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuropean Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnergy Authority",

        "content": "The 2024 Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections across the United Kingdom being held on the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Gateshead was a district of the Tyne and Wear metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. \nGateshead Council has continuously been under Labour control since its creation. The Liberal Democrats have generally been the main opposition. In the most recent election in 2023, Labour won 15 seats on 50.3% of the vote and the Liberal Democrats won 7 seats on 27.5% of the vote. The Conservatives received 12.5% of the vote and the Green Party received 7.5% of the vote, but neither party won any seats.\nPositions up for election in 2024 were last up for election in 2021. In that election, Labour won 19 seats and the Liberal Democrats won five seats.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election will take place by first-past-the-post voting, with wards generally being represented by three councillors, with one elected in each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Gateshead aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous Composition ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Heide Keller (15 October 1939 – 27 August 2021) was a German actor and screenwriter. She became known to a wide audience primarily through her portrayal of the head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur in around 80 episodes in the ZDF series Das Traumschiff and in 27 episodes of the spin-off Cruise into Happiness.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nHeide Keller was born on 15 October 1939 in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. She grew up in Düren, where she attended the Higher Commercial School.

After a few less prominent roles, from 1981 she played in the ZDF television series Das Traumschiff, first as hostess, and later as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur. From 2007 she was also seen in the role in a total of 27 episodes of the spin-off Cruise into Happiness. Keller also wrote scripts for individual episodes under the pseudonym Jac(ques) Dueppen. At the end of January 2017, it was announced that she would be leaving the television series at her own request. At the end of December 2017, her departure was discussed for the first time in the episode The Dream Ship: Uruguay. Her last appearance on the Dream Ship was in the following 80th episode The Dream Ship: Los Angeles, which aired on 1 January 2018.

        "content": "On 21 March 2024, David Ben Avraham (Hebrew: דוד בן אברהם), a 63-year-old Palestinian Jewish convert, was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier near Elazar, an Israeli settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. When Ben Avraham got out of a taxi, the soldier approached him and asked for his name and whether he was Jewish, to which Ben Avraham responded affirmatively. In the ensuing encounter, the soldier pointed his rifle at Ben Avraham and threatened to kill him if he reached for his bag on the ground; Ben Avraham then complied with the soldier's orders by putting his hands on his hand and stepping away from his bag, but was nevertheless shot dead.A knife was later found in Ben Avraham's bag, but The Times of Israel reported that there was no evidence that he posed a threat. The Israel Defense Forces opened an investigation into what it called a \"grave\" incident. The soldier, a reservist, was released a week later by an Israeli court. The Jerusalem Post stated that this killing joins a series of \"wrongful mistaken killings\" of Jewish Israelis and Arab Israelis that have occurred since 7 October 2023, \"in which, to date, the prosecution and courts have been extremely lenient on the killers.\"Originally Sameh Zaytoun (Arabic: سامح زيتون), Ben Avraham was a resident of Hebron and had changed his name upon converting to Judaism from Islam a number of years ago in Bnei Brak, Israel, having been inspired by his grandfather, who saved 25 Jews during the 1929 Hebron massacre. Following his conversion, he was jailed by the Palestinian Authority for 58 days in 2019. The Israeli government repeatedly denied his applications for Israeli citizenship, which The Times of Israel stated was \"ostensibly due to his Palestinian heritage.\" The Israeli Interior Ministry posthumously approved the residency status that he had been seeking.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBorn Sameh Muhammad Abd al-Rai Zaytoun (Arabic: سامح محمد عبد الراي زيتون), Ben Avraham had converted to Judaism from Islam a number of years ago in honour of his grandfather, who had saved 25 Jews during the 1929 Hebron massacre. Zaytoun's attempts to formalize his conversion were rebuffed several times by Israeli authorities until he eventually succeeded in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak, where he changed his name to David Ben Avraham. After his conversion, Ben Avraham's applications for Israeli citizenship had been repeatedly denied, which The Times of Israel stated may have been because he was Palestinian. Avraham was a resident of Hebron.In 2019, Ben Avraham was arrested and jailed by the Palestinian Authority for 58 days in Hebron, where he was reportedly tortured by guards and attacked and beaten by other inmates after they discovered that he had converted to Judaism. Palestinian religious figures also visited him in prison to convince him to retract his conversion, but he declined. A number of Israelis rallied for his release, including a resident of Hebron who organized a hunger strike for two weeks. Another fundraised for his bail, which was disbursed to a Hebron Palestinian court. Following his release from prison, Israeli first responders picked him up from the prison in a wheelchair.\n\n\n== Killing ==\nAccording to available CCTV and bodycam footage reported on by The Times of Israel, Ben Avraham exited a taxi on the morning of 21 March 2024 near the settlement of Elazar in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. An Israeli reservist then approached him and a confrontation ensued between the two. During the exchange, the reservist did not appear to believe that Ben Avraham was Jewish. Ben Avraham reached for his bag and was stopped by the reservist who said, \"Touch that and I'll kill you, do you understand me?\" The reservist then ordered Ben Avraham to put his hands up. Another video from the incident showed Ben Avraham with his hands on his head seconds before he was shot.The Jerusalem Post reported that Ben Avraham did not do anything suspicious other than get off at a bus location near Jewish residence that Palestinians did not typically use. A knife was later found in Ben Avraham's bag, but The Times of Israel reported that there was no evidence that he posed a threat and the Israeli military opened an investigation into what it called a \"grave incident\". Noam Arnon, a friend of Ben Avraham’s and a Hebron spokesperson, said that Ben Avraham carried the knife in his bag for self-defense.The reservist's attorneys opined that \"we do not doubt that the investigation will clarify the chain of events and the case [of David Ben Avraham] will end with an additional excellence award awarded to the soldier\". The attorneys also said that the soldier \"recently was honored for his bravery in thwarting the ramming attack that took place about three weeks ago in Gush Etzion.\" Israeli law does not allow use of lethal force in cases where an arrest is easily achievable.The reservist was detained by authorities. He was released a week later by the order of an Israeli military court judge, who said that the reservist had several reasons to believe that Ben Avraham to be a \"terrorist\". The Israeli judge said that Ben Avraham exited a taxi with Palestinian license plates near a settlement; that he told the reservist that he was going to Jerusalem despite not having a permit to enter Jerusalem; that he spoke Hebrew with an Arabic accent; that soldiers had been warned of potential \"terrorist\" activity; and that he had lowered his hands. Arnon said that Ben Avraham was continuing his study in religion and was on his way to Jerusalem for religious studies the day he was shot by the army reservist.Ben Avraham's death came days after two members of Israel's Shin Bet security service were fired upon and wounded between the Gush Etzion Junction and the Migdal Oz settlement, around two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Elazar bus stop. Over 350 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers in the occupied West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October 2023, mostly during attacks or clashes with Israeli troops. The Jerusalem Post said Ben Avraham's killing joins a series of \"wrongful mistaken killings\" of Jewish-Israelis and Arab-Israelis that have occurred since 7 October, \"in which, to date, the prosecution and courts have been extremely lenient on the killers\".After Ben Avraham's death, Israeli Minister of Interior Moshe Arbel granted Ben Avraham's request for Israeli residency, with Arbel commenting that this was to fulfill Ben Avraham's \"last wish to be part of the Israeli people\" as a form of \"justice, even if it is too late and under tragic circumstances\".\n\n\n== Funeral ==\nJewish custom is to bury the dead as soon as possible. Ben Avraham's burial was postponed for more than two weeks because his family opposed him receiving a Jewish funeral and submitted an appeal to bury him themselves in Hebron. A family court in Tel Aviv determined that Ben Avraham's conversion was proof that he wanted to be buried in a Jewish ceremony and authorized the funeral to move forward. Hebrew media outlets reported that dozens of residents from neighboring settlements attended his funeral. He was buried in Har Bracha, an Israeli West Bank settlement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKilling of Eyad al-Hallaq\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the first geological park in Brazil, recognized by UNESCO (global geopark).\nIt is located across six municipalities in Ceará: Barbalha, Crato, Juazeiro do Norte, Missão Velha, Nova Olinda, and Santana do Cariri. With a total area of 3,796 km², the park presents a vast biological, geological, and paleontological heritage.\nInitially, part of its territory was recognized as the Environmental Protection Area of Chapada do Araripe since 1997, on the plateau between 700 and 900 meters high, located near the border of Ceará with the states of Piauí and Pernambuco.\nIt holds one of the largest deposits of fossils from Lower Cretaceous in Brazil and in the world. This includes the largest concentration of pterosaur remains in the world, as well as 20 different orders of fossilized insects, approximately 110 million years old. It also contains preserved fossils of the earliest flowering plants, which demonstrate primitive interactions between insects and plants. Since September 2006, it has been integrated into the Global Geoparks Network and is recognized by UNESCO as a relevant geological and paleontological heritage of the world. It was the first geological park recognized in the Americas.\nOne of the objectives of the geological park is to preserve the natural wealth of Chapada do Araripe.\n\n\n== Geosites ==\nIn Araripe UNESCO Global Geopark there are nine geosites. Each geosite characterizes a diferent period of this region’s geological time.\n\nColina do Horto\nCachoeira de Missão Velha\nFloresta Petrificada do Cariri\nBatateira\nPedra Cariri\nParque dos Pterossauros\nRiacho do Meio\nPonte de Pedra\nPontal de Santa Cruz\n\n\n== In pop culture ==\nSeveral dinosaurs, pterosaurs, fish, and plants from the Geological Park of Araripe appear in the Brazilian science fiction work Hidden Reality (Realidade Oculta).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAraripe geopark on UNESCO website",

        "content": "Uddingston Football Club was an association football club from Uddingston in Lanarkshire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was the third senior club from the town ; its first record is of its joining the Scottish Football Association in August 1898.  It was set up at a difficult time for clubs given the rise of the Scottish Football League and other similar league competitions.  A Lanarkshire Football League was founded in October 1898, which required a £10 guarantee for visiting clubs, well beyond the capabilities of the smaller clubs.  A smaller Second League was held in the second half of the 1898–99 season, with Uddingston as one of the five members, but it seems to have fizzled out by the end of April.\nUddingston was duly without any level of success.  It entered the Lanarkshire Cup three times, from 1898–99 to 1900–01, as well as the Consolation Cup for clubs eliminated before the final; it played five times in the competition, losing four matches, with the exception being a 1–1 draw with Wishaw Thistle in the 1898–99 Consolation - a match which was both \"fluky and uninteresting\" and in which Uddingston had a goal disallowed.\nIt also entered the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1898–99 and 1899–1900.  In the former year, the club walked over Longriggend in the first round, and only lost 2–1 at Carfin in the second.  In the latter, the club gained its only competitive victory, with a 7–1 win at Glengowan, despite the home side being ranked slight favourite, but the club lost again in the second round, this time 3–1 at Wishaw, hindered by one of its better players (Crichton) having to cry off after an injury received against Carfin Emmet.  A protest against the Wishaw goalkeeper for being an \"irregular\" member was dismissed, Uddingston not learning from a failed protest by Wishaw Thistle against the same player after the first round.\nThe club was struck off the Scottish FA roll in August 1900.  The club still technically existed, as it was entered in the Lanarkshire Cup and was drawn to receive a bye in the first round, and paired with Motherwell in the second, but the tie did not take place.  The next Uddingston club was set up in 1910, but it was not a senior club, and the 1898 club remains the last senior club from the town.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club played in white.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club played at Meadowbank Park, as had its predecessor club.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Curriculum learning is a technique in machine learning in which a model is trained on examples of increasing difficulty, where the definition of \"difficulty\" may be provided externally or discovered automatically as part of the training process. This intended to attain good performance more quickly, or to converge to a better local optimum if the global optimum is not found.\n\n\n== Approach ==\nMost generally, curriculum learning is the technique of successively increasing the difficulty of examples in the training set that is presented to a model over multiple training iterations. This can produce better results than exposing the model to the full training set immediately under some circumstances; most typically, when the model is able to learn general principles from easier examples, and then gradually incorporate more complex and nuanced information as harder examples are introduced, such as edge cases. This has been shown to work in many domains, most likely as a form of regularization.There are several major variations in how the technique is applied:\n\nA concept of \"difficulty\" must be defined. This may come from human annotation or an external heuristic; for example in language modeling, shorter sentences might be classified as easier than longer ones. Another approach is to use the performance of another model, with examples accurately predicted by that model being classified as easier (providing a connection to boosting).\nDifficulty can be increased steadily or in distinct epochs, and in a deterministic schedule or according to a probability distribution. This may also be moderated by a requirement for diversity at each stage, in cases where easier examples are likely to be disproportionately similar to each other.\nApplications must also decide the schedule for increasing the difficulty. Simple approaches may use a fixed schedule, such as training on easy examples for half of the available iterations and then all examples for the second half. Other approaches use self-paced learning to increase the difficulty in proportion to the performance of the model on the current set.Since curriculum learning only concerns the selection and ordering of training data, it can be combined with many other techniques in machine learning. The success of the method assumes that a model trained for an easier version of the problem can generalize to harder versions, so it can be seen as a form of transfer learning. Some authors also consider curriculum learning to include other forms of progressively increasing complexity, such as increasing the number of model parameters. It is frequently combined with reinforcement learning, such as learning a simplified version of a game first.Some domains have shown success with anti-curriculum learning: training on the most difficult examples first. One example is the ACCAN method for speech recognition, which trains on the examples with the highest signal-to-noise ratio first.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"curriculum learning\" was introduced by Yoshua Bengio et al in 2009, with reference to the psychological technique of shaping in animals and structured education for humans: beginning with the simplest concepts and then building on them. The authors also note that the application of this technique in machine learning has its roots in the early study of neural networks such as Jeffrey Elman's 1993 paper Learning and development in neural networks: the importance of starting small.  Bengio et al showed good results for problems in image classification, such as identifying geometric shapes with progressively more complex forms, and language modeling, such as training with a gradually expanding vocabulary. They conclude that, for curriculum strategies, \"their beneficial effect is most pronounced on the test\nset\", suggesting good generalization.\nThe technique has since been applied to many other domains:\n\nNatural language processing:\nPart-of-speech tagging\nIntent detection\nSentiment analysis\nMachine translation\nSpeech recognition\nImage recognition:\nFacial recognition\nObject detection\nReinforcement learning:\nGame-playing\nGraph learning\nMatrix factorization\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCurriculum Learning: A Survey\nA Survey on Curriculum Learning\nCurriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Framework and Survey\nCurriculum learning at IEEE Xplore",

        "content": "The Democratic Party of Australia (DPA), sometimes referred to as the Australian Democratic Party, was an Australian political party that was active in the mid-1950s.\nAhead of the 1953 Senate election, the party merged with the Queensland-based Independent Democratic Party (IDP). However, they split following the election. The party was also separate from the North Queensland Democratic Party, which had itself been formed just weeks after the DPA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was formed in Sydney on 17 February 1953 by a group who had organised the campaign of independent candidate Martin Hardie at the 1952 Bradfield by-election. It was chaired by former Willoughby mayor A. R. Baldwin. According to its secretary, the party opposed the Liberal Party's policy on taxation and the Labor Party's policy on socialisation.\nThe party merged with the Independent Democrats several months before the 1953 Senate election, with the DPA's Charles Russell (a former Country Party MP) saying the decision was made because both parties had similar aims and ideologies. The party endorsed public health administrator Raphael Cilento (of the IDP) as its lead candidate in Queensland.\nAt the Senate election, the party's ticket was unsuccessful, winning 6% of the vote. Shortly after, the party opened nominations for candidates for the next federal election.\nThe party endorsed Thomas Brosnan as its candidate for the 1953 Lang by-election. However, Brosnan was disendorsed after the close of nominations as he had not been a resident of Australia for three years.\nFollowing the by-election, several members of the party's New South Wales executive resigned, including organising secretary Douglas Maxwell in October 1953. Around this time, the DPA split from the IDP.\nOn 6 June 1954, the party's New South Wales branch disbanded, thus dissolving the party entirely.\n\n\n== Leaders ==\n\n\n=== President ===\n\n\n== References ==",

The Association of Social Competition later withdrew the lawsuit before the Federal Court of Justice in January 2022 after a fundamental decision of the Federal Court in September 2021 in the trial against influencers Cathy Hummels, Leonie Hanne and Luisa- Maxime Huss was decided on the labeling of advertising in favor of influencers. The association bore the costs of the legal dispute against Reif.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nStrong & Beautiful.

        "content": "Yatha' Amr Watar bin Yakarib Malik (d. 695 BC) was one of the ancient Mukarrib of Saba, who ruled in the last two decades of the eighth century BC.\nHe is the author of the oldest and most important ancient historical documents related to news of the establishment of the state of Saba, which later turned into a kingdom, during the reign of King Karib'il Watar in the seventh century BC.\nAccording to a special archaeological inscription by the Assyrian king Sargon II and the records of Dur-Sharrukin, Itamra of the Saba paid tribute to Sargon II during the seventh year of his reign, that is, approximately the year 715 BC.\n\n\n== In Assyrian records ==\nThe Sabaean ruler “Yatha Amr Watar” was mentioned during the reign of Sargon II in the year 715 BC, this is in the following phrases:\nFrom Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and “Šamši,” queen of Arabia, and Atamra of Saba’i, and the kings of the coast and the gold desert, special mountain plants, precious stones, ivory, and maple seeds, And various kinds of aromatic herbs, horses, and camels, and they delivered them to me as tribute.”\n“From Pharaoh, king of Egypt, Šamši, queen of Arabia, and Atamra of Saba, give me raw gold from the mountains, and horses and camels.”\n\n\n== In Sabaean inscriptions ==\nThe most important source for the era of \"Yatha Amr Watar\" is a huge inscription discovered in 2005, during excavations carried out by the German Archaeological Institute in the middle of the Almaqah Temple in Sirwah. It is erected in front of the previously discovered inscriptions of Karib Il Watar ibn Dhamar Ali (inscriptions RES 3945 and inscriptions RES 3946, written on opposite sides of the same stone block).These two devotees, each individually, left a wonderful record of his reign through two long inscriptions in the Al-Maqa Temple in the ancient Sabaean city of Sirwah. . Thanks to comparison with Assyrian texts from Mesopotamia, the history of these two inscriptions was identified, and the identity of these two great inscriptions was revealed. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Coventry City Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections across the United Kingdom being held on the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Coventry was a district of the West Midlands metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The West Midlands Combined Authority was created in 2016 and began electing the mayor of the West Midlands from 2017, which was given strategic powers covering a region coterminous with the former West Midlands metropolitan county.\nCoventry Council has variously been under Labour control, Conservative control and no overall control since it was established. Labour most recently gained control of the council in the 2010 election, when they gained six seats at the expense of the Conservatives and Socialist Alternative. Labour continued to make gains to consolidate its majority on the council in the 2011 and 2012 elections, since when the party's position has remained stable. In the most recent election in 2023, Labour won 13 of the seats up for election with 50.4% of the vote, the Conservatives won four seats with 29.5% of the vote, and the Greens won one seat with 9.3% of the vote. Labour maintained its majority on the council.\nSeats up for election in 2023 were last elected in 2021. This election was originally scheduled for 2020, but was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that election, Labour won thirteen seats and the Conservatives won six seats.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election will take place by first-past-the-post voting, with wards being represented by three councillors, with one councillor elected in each ward each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Coventry aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election. People voting in this election in Coventry only vote for a councillor in the ward they reside.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\n8 September 2023: Becky Gittins (Labour) resigns to stand as the Labour candidate for Clwyd East at the 2024 general election. A by-election is scheduled for 26 October 2023.\n26 October 2023: The Earlsdon by-election is won by Lynette Kelly; Labour holds the seat.\n\n\n== References ==",

The series will be played over four weeks culminating in the 2024 A-League Women Grand Final.\n\n\n== Qualification ==\n\nWestern United, Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets all confirmed their spots in the elimination-finals. Semi-finalists Melbourne City and Sydney FC were confirmed in finishing the top two spots. Melbourne Victory qualified for the elimination-finals through a 4–0 win over Premiership seeking Sydney FC, as Melbourne City claimed the premiership in a 2–1 win over Perth Glory to finish two points clear ahead of second-placed Sydney FC.\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\n\n== Matches ==\nThe system used for the 2024 A-League Women finals series is the modified top-six play-offs by the A-Leagues. The top two teams enter the two-legged semi-finals receiving the bye for the elimination-finals in which the teams from third placed to sixth place enter the elimination-finals with \"third against sixth\" and \"fourth against fifth\". Losers for the elimination-finals are eliminated, and winners qualify for the two-legged semi-finals.\nFirst placed team in the semi-finals plays the lowest ranked elimination-final winning team and second placed team in the semi-finals plays the highest ranked elimination-final winner. Home-state advantage goes to the team with the higher ladder position.\n\n\n=== Elimination-finals ===\nThird-placed Western United who qualified for successive finals series played their first home finals match, which was against sixth-placed Newcastle Jets appearing in their first finals series since 2018. Newcastle took the lead 11 minutes in through Sarina Bolden until Western equalised by Alana Cerne. Bolden scored a penalty for Newcastle to take the lead into half-time, as Catherine Zimmerman score a penalty for Western to equalize again. In extra-time, Newcastle scored two further goals through Melina Ayres and Sophie Haban to win the match 4–2 and qualify for the semi-finals against Melbourne City.\n\nFourth-placed Melbourne Victory will host a finals match for the first time since 2020, against fifth-placed Central Coast Mariners who in their return season qualified for back-to-back finals series since 2009.\n\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\n\n\n=== Grand Final ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA-Leagues official website",

        "content": "IndExs – Index of Exsiccatae is an online biological database that plays a pivotal role in documenting more than 2,200 historical and ongoing series of exsiccatae and exsiccata-like works. Managed by the Botanische Staatssammlung München in München, IndExs serves as a comprehensive data repository for these series, providing detailed titles with information on the more than 1,300 editors, bibliographic information, exsiccatal numbers, publication timespans, ranges, information on preceding and superseding series and publishers. Exsiccatae, organised series of biological specimens distributed among biological collections, are essential resources found in major herbaria worldwide. Open access to the general information on exsiccatae facilitates global scientific engagement and research.\n\n\n== History and purpose ==\nLaunched in 2001, IndExs has become indispensable to herbaria, fungaria, and digitisation initiatives, catering to their evolving scientific content needs. The database categorises exsiccatae and the specimens they distribute, focusing on major organismic groups within botany and mycology. This categorisation is enhanced by images of exemplary specimen labels from more than 70 herbaria citing their Index Herbariorum´s acronyms.  IndExs standardizes the naming conventions for exsiccata series.IndExs leverages the DiversityExsiccatae module of the Diversity Workbench framework as database management system. Recently, efforts to align its technical infrastructure with Wikidata concepts have begun, indicating a move towards more integrated and semantic web-based data management practices. The main focus is on the disambiguation of names of more than 1,300 editors and the integration of information for 2,200 exsiccata series into the semantic web. This move involves adopting Wikidata identifiers for the precise identification of editors, contributing additional details to existing Wikidata entries about their scientific work, and creating new entries where necessary. A proposed new property, the \"IndExs Exsiccata ID,\" aims to link directly to IndExs, allowing for the incorporation of exsiccata series information into Wikidata. This integration facilitates a linked data environment, ensuring that the significant contributions of botanical and mycological editors and their work are more accessible and accurately represented in global data repositories.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe practical application of IndExs is highlighted by its use in the cataloguing and analysis of the bryophyte collection at the National Herbarium in Pretoria (PRE), South Africa. In this project, IndExs was used to compile the first catalogue of exsiccatae for the PRE collection and provided the necessary framework and reference material to identify and classify the 66 exsiccatae series represented in the collection. Through IndExs, the project team was able to identify and document significant exsiccatae within the PRE collection, including rare sets like Anton Rehmann's Musci Austro-Africani and Bryophyta Antarctica exsiccata edited by Ryszard Ochyra. This case shows how IndExs facilitates the documentation and study of botanical specimens, enabling the first comprehensive catalog of exsiccatae within a major herbarium collection. Through IndExs, researchers can access information on exsiccatae, contributing to botanical research, taxonomy, and the history of botanical exploration and exchange. Similarly, the IndExs has been proposed for use as a reference list in the digitisation of German herbaria specimens and related biodiversity informatics projects.\n\n\n== References ==",

The film follows New York City Detective Chris Jones (Tobias Truvillion) who get shot by a white detective, returns fire and kills him.\nThe film was released in selected theatres on May 7, 2021, by Mutiny Pictures. Film writer Taheim Bryan was shot to death in New York City in August 2021 sitting in his Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm critic Tomris Laffly from Variety gave it a mixed review writing: \"Trying to be The Wire of the BLM era, Brendan Kyle Cochrane's haphazardly edited New York-based drama of shifting perspectives feels too unfocused and overstuffed for a feature.\" and same time praised Truvillion's performance writing: \"Thankfully, Truvillion in one of the leading parts is an exception to this overarching shortcoming. As Chris, a good cop in a barrel of bad apples, he puts forth a performance that is in equal parts authentic and tender.\"\nSandie Angulo Chen from Common Sense Media gave it 3 of 5 stars writing: \"Relevant themes and Truvillion's stand-out performance rescue this drama from preachy dialogue and oversimplification of the tensions between Black communities and law enforcement.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEqual Standard at IMDb \nEqual Standard at Rotten Tomatoes",

She twice represented the Dominion at World Conventions of the WCTU.\nMcKee favored equal suffrage, total Prohibition of the liquor traffic, and independence in politics. During World War I, she engaged in temperance work among the Canadian soldiers and sailors.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn religion, McKee was Presbyterian. \nOn May 20, 1864, she married the Rev. Thomas McKee, J.P.S., inspector of schools at Brockville. The couple had five sons and three daughters. Rev. and Mrs. McKee removed to North Bay, Ontario, in 1913.

Located on the left bank of the Virbu River, along Ventspils—Tukums II railway (Sabile station), it is 16 km away from the municipality center Talsi and 105 km from Riga, the national capital.\nJaunpagasts is home to the parish administration, Virbu primary school, cultural center, kindergarten, library, family doctor's practice, and the Neivakene Old Believers Church (built in 1928). The largest companies are SIA \"Jaunpagasts Plus\" (Brūzī) and SIA \"Jaunalko\".\n\n\n== History ==\nJaunpagasts is mentioned in historical sources for the first time in 1237 in the feudal book. The present-day settlement was established on the land of the former Jaunpagasts (Neuwacken) manor (now the inhabited place Brūzis on the right bank of the Virbu River) near the railway station. In 1909–1911, with the financial support of the Don Agrarian Bank, approximately 120 families settled in the vicinity of Jaunpagasts. In the post-war years, Jaunpagasts became the central village of the Soviet collective farm \"Virbi\".\n\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to the 2022 census, the population of the village is 392 people.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tuāfale Tanoa’i AKA Linda T is a DJ, photographer, documentary maker and performance video installation artist of New Zealand. She is often known as DJ Linda T. Through her art she documents often misrepresented communities including Māori, Pasifika and LGBTQI+ communities which she is connected to.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTanoa'i grew up in Kingsland, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. Her parents were both migrants to New Zealand from Sāmoa. Tanoa'i is Sāmoan.\nTanoa'i has a Masters in Art and Design from Auckland University of Technology (AUT) with First Class Honours. Her exegesis was called Storytelling as koha: consolidating community memories. It explored a 'fusion of Tangata Whenua and Pacific perspectives within a performance installation framework'.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTanoa'i has worked in local radio, TV and on short films. Since the early 1980s Tanoa'i has been documenting small communities in Aotearoa, New Zealand. An exhibition in 2018 called Storytelling as koha: consolidating community memories based on her university Masters at Corbans Estate Arts Centre in Auckland presented decades of work and the installation was described as an archive, 'from the political to personal, pertaining to Pacific, Māori, and LGBTQI communities'. In this exhibition Tanoa’i's were interviews, photographs and a soundscape providing visibility to people and communities often misrepresented. Of her work Tanoa'i says, \"“What I do is unique, I’m not into capitalism or mainstream movie-making. Much of the work I do I gift back to the communities that feature in the works.”\nTanoa'i was a founding member of D.A.N.C.E. Art Club (Distinguished All Night Community Entertainers Art Club) formed in 2008 while she was studying. Other founders were Ahilapalapa Rands, Vailmaila Urale and Chris Fitzgerald. They created events to disrupt what 'fine arts' was presented as, events included pool nights and a radio station. One event was a 'noho' (a group stay-in event) to brig together collaborative and collective artists 'indigenous to Moana-nui-a-Kiwa'.1. Groups included Mata Aho Collective, FAFSWAG, Oceania Interrupted, SaVAge Klub and others.\nOne of the projects was an exhibition called Welcome curated by Ahilapalapa Rands and it included a Guinness World Record attempt to hold the longest DJing marathon in a public space. Tanoa'i was the DJ, and the event went for three days but did not break the record.\nAn ongoing installation artwork from Tanoa'i is titled LTTV (2009-). Arts-writer Iona Gordon-Smith describes viewers of the exhibition being invited on-stage and their interviews become part of the exhibition. Tanoa'i targets people under-represented on TV including 'Māori, Moana and queer peoples'. This exposes the process and presents the outcome of a media process and is inclusive of viewers removing the usual separation.\nTanoa'i was the 2019 Pacific Artist in Residence at the University of Canterbury supported by Creative New Zealand and the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies. During the residency she presented work at the Physics Room. It was called, Spontaneous Intentionality.\nThe group exhibition at Dunedin Public Art Gallery From the Shore (2021) included work by Tanoa'i alongside others such as Tracey Mofatt, Tanu Gogo and Lisa Reihana, reference points for the art was from Mereta Mita and Barry Barclay. Tanoa'i presented LTTV (2009-) and participants spoke about Mita and Barclay.\nIn 2017 and 2020 Tanoa'i was programmed as a DJ in Music In The Square, at Aotea Square, Auckland. In 2020 Tanoa'i created a documentary about a month travelling in the USA watching women musician concerts called Chasing Chaka 2018: A Healing Adventure.  Tanoa'i was on a NZ On Air Music panel in 2022 selecting NewMusic Pasifika recipients.\nAs a political statement Tanoa'i says: \"Capitalism doesn’t have to be the foundation of our present human reality. I’m not suggesting anarchy. I’m suggesting Pacific Peace.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2008 Tanoa'i received the Emerging Pacific Artist award at the Creative New Zealand Arts Pasifika Awards.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nMoana-nui-a Kiwa is the oceans of Kiwa, and is the Pacific Ocean in its broadest sense.",

        "content": "Raisa Opanasivna Kyrychenko (née Korzh; Ukrainian: Раїса Опанасівна Кириченко; 14 October 1943 – 9 February 2005) was a Ukrainian mezzo-soprano singer and music teacher who is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Princess Olga. The singer's vast repertory included compositions by modern artists as well as traditional songs from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 14 October 1943, in the Ukrainian village of Koreshchyna. Conflicting sources stated her birthday on 14 November. Raisa participated actively in the community and received her first singing lesson at the Zemlyankiv school. Although she was employed in a communal farm, she continued to sing in a chorus that she and other girls had founded. She sang as a soloist in the school choir when she studied in middle school. She later graduated frorm the Kharkiv National Kotlyarevsky University of Arts in the late 1980s.  \n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Kremenchuk Automobile Plant's house of culture's district choir leader, Pavlo Ochenash, brought notice to her distinctive voice. He was the one who assisted the young Raisa in obtaining the approval of the authorities of the communal farms to relocate to the city and join the choir.\nShe spent her 19 years in Cherkasy, right on the brink of her eventual heyday in Poltava. She started having asthma attacks after the construction of the Azot chemical plant, which had a negative impact on her career. Fedir Morgun, the first secretary of the Poltava Oblast Council at the time, fell in love with her profession, and doctors recommended her to leave the city. To bring her back home, he dispatched his colleagues Herman Yurchenko and Hryhoriy Levchenko. A new chapter in her artistic life as well as the life of Poltava the artist opened.\nRaisa joined the Poltava Philharmonic's Raiselka group in 1962. She came to Zhytomyr and started singing with the ensemble Lyonok in 1964 after receiving an invitation from its leader. She sang solos with the Kherson Philharmonic at that time. She joined the Cherkasy Folk Choir in 1968. Although a folk group Rosava was made for her in Cherkasy in 1983, she returned to Poltava in 1987 due to disagreements with the Philharmonic leadership. She then joined the Churaivna group there.\nHleb Kudryashov, her biographer, further claims that not many people are aware that Raisa donated her Shevchenko National Prize to the Chernobyl charity. It so happened that in April of 1986, following her receipt of this prize in March, the Chernobyl disaster occurred. She gave a sizable donation as she was unable to turn away from the incident.\nOther hits follow the song I'm your Cossack in Poltava. In Ukraine, Raisa achieves a significant achievement in media. She left the traditional folk tunes behind and made her way onto the main stage. The lyrics to the Mr. Colonel, nevertheless, sparked controversy since it used the term \"Mr. Colonel\" rather than \"comrade.\" Years later, the address \"Mr. Colonel\" was to become customary for the Ukrainian Ground Forces, even if not everybody appreciated it at that point.\nAfter Mr. Colonel became popular, she began to release an increasing number of pop successes. The vocalist performs at the Freestyle band's studio. The Cherry Bloomss and The Fate of My Village are the two CDs that Raisa has released. She has been employed as a vocal instructor at the Poltava Mykola Lysenko College of Arts in 1994.\nFollowing her Canadian tour in 1995, Raisa started experiencing renal issues. Funds were raised by Ukrainians for the procedure, which involved her flying to Germany in November 1996 to get treatment and be ready for a surgery in Kyiv. The singer had a transplant of her kidneys in Kyiv on 2 June 1998. Her life was prolonged by this procedure by eight years. She performed overseas, notably in the United States. Baltimore, an American city, has made her an honorary citizen in 1983. Other countries she toured included Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Algeria, India, Tunisia, Malaysia, the Philippines.\nFrom September 1999 until October 2001, Raisa served on the committee for the Shevchenko National Prize. She had her coronary arteries operated on at the National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology on 1 February 2005. The damage was caused by the operation she was receiving for renal treatment. But the surgery was ineffective and she passed away from cardiac illness on 9 February 2005. As directed by Raisa, she was buried close to her mother's tomb in the village of Koreshchyna, in the Poltava Oblast.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRaisa met her future husband, Mykola Kyrychenko, a accordionist, composer, and arranger, in Poltava. The husband outlived her by 8 years during their 43-year happily ever after. In 2000, she relocated her residence to Kyiv.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nIn honor of Raisa, a memorial plaque was inaugurated at her parents' home on 13 October 2005, and a church was constructed in the village of Koreshchyna. The home at 40 Sichovykh Striltsiv Street in Kyiv, where she resided from 1997 to 2005, has a memorial plaque placed on its exterior. In Cherkasy, a bust was built in 2018 close to the Regional Philharmonic building. In addition to the sculpture of her placed on Raisa Kyrychenko Street outside the Public Poltava administration building on 13 October 2012, a memorial plaque was also placed on the home where she resided in Poltava on 13 October 2005. The Raisa Kyrychenko Museum in Poltava, which is housed within the Poltava V.G. Korolenko National Pedagogical University, preserves her legacy. The singer's records, outfit, shoes, and old pictures are all shown on different cassettes in the museum.\nRaisa has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (31 October 2003)\n Order of Princess Olga First Class (3 March 2001)\n Order of Princess Olga Second Class (4 March 1999)\n Order of Princess Olga Third Class (3 March 1998)\nShevchenko National Prize (1986)\nPeople's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR (1979)\nHonored Artist of the Ukrainian SSR (1973)\nHonorary Citizen of Baltimore (1983)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

She was called the \"Mother of 100,000 babies\".\n\n\n== Life ==\nShaw was born in Murrumburrah, New South Wales. Her parents were Mary Emillia (born Druitt) and her husband the Rev. Augustus Rutherford Shaw. They had both been born in Australia. She was their first child and they would have five more. She trained as a nurse at Marrickville Hospital in the suburbs of Sydney during the war years of 1914 to 1917. She qualified as a midwife in the following year at what became the Royal Hospital for Women. She volunteered for the military but the armistice was soon agreed.\nIn January 1919 Shaw joined Crown Street Women's Hospital as deputy matron and was appointed matron in 1936.\nFrom 1938 until the end of her career she was a member of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association's council.\nIn 1951 she was still organising the nursing at Crown Street Hospital when she was lauded for arranging what was called a \"Baby Bureau\". Previously expectant women had to go from hospital to hospital in Sydney to find a bed where they could give birth. Shaw's Maternity Booking Office for Metropolitan Hospitals (aka Baby Bureau) took on this task giving mothers a one-stop shop where they would be told of a hospital that had a free bed for them. The booking also benefitted the hospitals as mothers would reserve beds in several hospitals to ensure that they had a space.\nShaw retired as a matron in 1952 having been identified as \"the mother of 100,000\" babies. A public appeal raised a thousand pounds for her. She had been made an OBE in 1950 for her services to nursing.\nShe died in Waverley in 1974.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "A burial stone is a method of blocking burial caves and other narrow openings\n\n\n== Blocking stones in burial caves ==\nThe stone's purpose is to prevent from unwanted visitors and animals enterring the burial system.\nIn the Land of Israel, square blocking stones are common in burial systems from the First Temple period, adapted as a cork for the opening of the rock-cut tomb system. Even when the blocking stone is not present in the area, it is visible that the burisal cave was sealed with a stone by the chippings of the edge of the cave opening. Burial caves of this type can be seen on the slopes of Kfar Shiloh, in front of the City of David.\nIn Second Temple period burial systems, round blocking stones that move on a rail and seal the opening, can be found. The stone was intencially large and heavy, it needed a joint effort of several people to move it, making it difficult for grave robbers and vagabonds opening or breaking in. Tombs with such blocking stones can be found in the Hurvat Midras, in a preserved burial cave on the \"Jo'ara road\" (6954), near its intersection with road 66 and in the Tombs of the Kings in Jerusalem. There are common legends about special mechanisms for rolling the heavy blocking stones, but no evidence of such mechanisms has been found.Apart from a physical barrier preventing the entry of men and pests, the blocking stone had another purpose that was to prevent ṭumah (impuriity) exiting the cave. The Mishnah, Tractate Oholot, Chapter 15, Mishniyot 8 - 9 teaches that various objects can be used as a blocking stone in order to prevent impurity from leaving, but the main advantage of the stone is that it does not receive ṭumah, (see also Mishna Torah to Rambam, Book of Taharah, Laws of Dead Impurity, Chapter 6).\n\n\n== Blocking stones for security purposes ==\nEvidence of the use of blocking stones for security purposes can be found during the Roman period in the Land of Israel. During the Bar Kokhba revolt, blocking stones were used to seal the rebels' hiding systems.\nIn many excavation sites in the Land of Israel, especially sites in the mountain area from the Byzantine period, large rolling stones and rails for rolling them were discovered at the entrances of public buildings (such as synagogues). The courtyard of the building was surrounded by a solid wall and had a single and relatively narrow opening. At the opening threshold a rail was installed and on the sides of the opening niches were designed in the wall and in them was placed the blocking stone. This made it possible to safely close the place when not in use and store valuables inside. Only a joint effort could open the building's blocking stone, this prevented a single man enterring the place. It also made it possible to create a safe gathering place for the settlements' population, who could escape to a public house and shut themselves inside fortifying themselves against enemies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The sarcophagus of Princess Olga from the Tithe Church is a carved slate sarcophagus from the 11th century, found during excavations of the Tithe Church in Kyiv in 1826. Kept in the St. Sophia Cathedral. Some researchers believe that Princess Olga, who is known to have been reburied in the Church of the Tithes by her grandson Prince Vladimir around 1007, was buried there. The sarcophagus is exhibited in Sofia of Kyiv as the “Sarcophagus of Princess Olga”. However, this attribution is questioned by most researchers, although the possibility that Princess Olga could have been buried in the sarcophagus is not completely ruled out.\nThe sarcophagus is covered with detailed carvings in the Byzantine style, similar to those found on the marble sarcophagus of Yaroslav the Wise and on the slate slabs of the choir of St. Sophia Cathedral.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe sarcophagus is made of seven slabs of red slate (pyrophyllite slate), 4 cm thick, probably mined near Ovruch. The plates are connected internally by two iron brackets. The shape of the lower part is a rectangular parallelepiped, and the upper part (lid) is gable. The length of the sarcophagus is 198 cm, width 60 cm, height 96 cm.\nThe composition of the sarcophagus is like a house, made of seven individual slabs fastened together, covered with a gable roof. The relief treatment of its sides is different: one longitudinal side, apparently intended to be moved towards the wall, is decorated with only six identical simple crosses with trapezoidally expanded ends of the branches. Three of them are on the half of the lid and three, respectively, on the side wall. The front side of the sarcophagus is richly decorated with relief, as is the half of the lid covering it. Three crosses and three cypress trees alternate on the wall, placed in six identical spans of the arcature belt. There are four rosettes on the lid, connected by wires to each other and to the frame. The weaving tape has a wide central roll and is profiled along the edges with deep grooves. The end walls of the sarcophagus are decorated with a flourished cross and a cross “on a sphere” of the same shape. Thus, the sarcophagus is an excellent example of wickerwork from the Middle Byzantine period.\n\n\n== Discovery and exploration ==\nThe sarcophagus was first found in 1826 during excavations conducted by architect Nikolai Efimov. It was located outside the main foundation of the Church of the Tithes at the northern wall between the lysens, walled up on the right side of the entrance to the 12th-century plinthic tomb. The sarcophagus was studied in more detail during repeated excavations by Dmitry Mileev in 1908 (in the interim, the sarcophagus remained buried at the discovery site).\nThe sarcophagus contained a preserved complete skeleton, on which, according to Efimov's initial report, there were the remains of women's clothing: a brocade bedspread and women's shoes. A 1908 study revealed that the skeleton was in poor condition, it was reported that the remains of clothing and leather from boots were then stored on it, and the presence of traces of purple oxides on the bones indicate that metal objects were not preserved. The sex of the buried person was not clearly established for the skeleton, although the relatively small size indicated a woman or teenager.\nAfter Mileev's excavations, the sarcophagus was filled up again. In 1918, it was excavated for the third time and moved to the Historical Museum. Later, the sarcophagus was moved to St. Sophia Cathedral.\n\n\n== Dating ==\n\nResearchers date the sarcophagus mainly to the beginning of the first half of the 11th century, but there are also hypotheses regarding the 10th or 12th century.\nThe carving is made in the same Byzantine style as on the marble sarcophagus of Yaroslav the Wise; in particular, similar images of cypress trees and crosses are used. This type of decoration is common in Byzantine reliefs from the 11th century. A. N. Grabar noted that similar decoration (in particular, rows of arches) is found on some sarcophagi depicted in the Minology of Basil II miniatures. It associated the slate sarcophagus, like the sarcophagus of Yaroslav the Wise, as an example of Constantinople sculpture of the first third of the 11th century.\nAccording to N. E. Makarenko, the difference in the design of the walls indicates that the two masters made the sarcophagus at the end of the 10th-11th centuries in different manners and is the result of Byzantine influence coming through the Balkans. V. G. Putsko agrees with him, believing that at least two craftsmen worked on the sarcophagus. However, he explains the difference in decor by the fact that the masters did not copy entire compositional schemes, only individual elements. M. K. Karger believes that by the 11th century, local stone-cutters in Kyiv made sarcophagi for the Kyiv nobility. “Among them, along with smooth-walled ones, sarcophagi are also known, completely covered with bas-relief carvings.”\nAlthough the carving motifs on the sarcophagus are traditional for Byzantine sculpture of the 11th century, they are also found on monuments of the 12th-13th centuries, for example, on reliefs from Smyrna from the late 11th-12th centuries or Thessaloniki from the 12th-13th centuries. This extends the dating of the slate sarcophagus to the 11th-12th centuries.\n\n\n== Attribution ==\nThe Church of the Tithes was built as a cathedral at the princely court and from the very beginning became the grand ducal tomb. Vladimir moved the tomb of Princess Olga to the church, then in 1011 one of his wives, the Byzantine Anna, was buried there, and in 1015 Vladimir himself was buried next to her. In 1078, the coffin of Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich was placed in the Tithe Church. In addition, in 1044, Yaroslav the Wise posthumously baptized his uncles, princes Yaropolk and Oleg Svyatoslavich, and moved their burials to the Tithe Church.\nThe chronicles mention only two women buried in the Church of the Tithes—Princesses Olga (1007) and Anna (1011). Anna, like Vladimir, was buried in a marble sarcophagus, but there was no mention of Olga's sarcophagus. Therefore, immediately after its discovery, the slate sarcophagus began to be attributed to Princess Olga. Archaeological studies of the Church of the Tithes revealed a large number of fragments of at least one, completely destroyed, marble monolithic sarcophagus, which in shape, size and carving was very similar to the sarcophagus of Yaroslav the Wise in the St. Sophia Cathedral. This confirms that there were marble sarcophagi in the Church of the Tithes, as the chronicles report, and at least Prince Vladimir was buried in such a sarcophagus, which means that the reports of the burial of Princess Anna in a marble sarcophagus are plausible. That is, it is unlikely that the slate sarcophagus from the Church of the Tithes could have belonged to Princess Anna.\nHowever, most researchers believe that the slate sarcophagus was discovered in its original location. Therefore, it is unlikely that Princess Olga could have been buried outside the Tithe Church near its wall, instead of being buried inside the temple. The appearance of this sarcophagus does not coincide with the chronicle description of the sarcophagus of Princess Olga, according to which there was a window in the upper part of the sarcophagus through which the body of the princess could be seen. However, even if we accept the chronicle description of the sarcophagus as accurate, this does not exclude the possibility of reburying the princess in another sarcophagus or changing the lid slab.\nIn 1824, Kondrat Lokhvitsky, a rival of Efimov, was the first to attempt to excavate the Church of the Tithes. Among other things, he found three slate sarcophagi, but their further fate is unknown. Also on the territory of the church, in addition to fragments of a marble sarcophagus, fragments of at least five slate ones were found. Not all burials of the Church of the Tithes were mentioned in the chronicles, and perhaps this was one of such burials. It is also not completely ruled out that the skeleton could have been male, and the remains of clothing and shoes were mistakenly interpreted as female. In general, the question of the attribution of the sarcophagus remains unresolved, but it is accepted that a member of the family of Kyiv princes was buried in it.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2022, the album was released in a limited edition on vinyl.Hits from this album include the title track, Oda radosti – anegdote evrointegracija (Ode to joy – European integration angedotes), Serator (Sucker)...\n\n\n== Album ==\nThe album was named after the novel of the same name by Katherine Anne Porter. The themes and songs from this album are treated electronically to a good extent, they are less rockier than one might expect, but in the end it is Rambo, as the public has accepted, respected, or simply \"appreciated\" him less. The viewership of certain songs is absolutely respectable, which clearly speaks of the popularity of Rambo himself.\n\n\n=== Cover ===\nThe original album cover features a red FAP truck in the shape of a submarine, while the vinyl cover features an illustration of sailors navigating a flat Earth \"lying\" on sewer pipes.\n\n\n== Samples ==\n\"Oda radosti – anegdote evrointegracija\" – Ode to Joy (Beethoven)\n\"Platiš 1 dobiješ 2\" – Pobegulja (song from Zona Zamfirova)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrod budala at Discogs",

        "content": "Sir William Rae  (1786 – 8 April 1873) was a Scottish naval surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRae was born in 1786. He was the son of Matthew Rae of Park-end, Dumfries. He was educated at Lochmaben and Dumfries, and afterwards graduated M.D. at Edinburgh University. In 1804 he entered the medical service of the East India Company, but in the following year was transferred as surgeon to the royal navy. He served first in the Culloden under Sir Edward Pellew (afterwards Lord Exmouth). In 1807, when in the Fox, he took part in the destruction of the Dutch ships at Gressic in Java. Subsequently, when the squadron was becalmed in the Bay of Bengal, he contrived an apparatus for distilling water. When attached to the Leyden in 1812–13 he was very successful in his treatment of the troops suffering from yellow fever at Cartagena and Gibraltar, and received the thanks of the commander-in-chief and the medical board.\nIn 1824 he was appointed to the Bermuda station. He became M.R.C.S. in 1811, extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1839, and F.R.C.S. in 1843. He ultimately attained the rank of inspector-general of hospitals and fleets, and retired on a pension to a country practice near Barnstaple. He was created C.B. in 1855, and knighted in 1858. He died at Hornby Lodge, Newton Abbot, Devonshire, on 8 April 1873, and was buried at Wolborough. Rae married, in 1814, Mary, daughter of Robert Bell; and secondly, in 1831, Maria, daughter of Assistant-commissary-general R. Lee.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Gerald le Grys Norgate (1896). \"Rae, William\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

All 100 seats in the State Council will be up for reelection.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nUnder current election laws, the State Council is elected for a term of five years, with parallel voting. 50 seats are elected by party-list proportional representation with a 5% electoral threshold, with the other half elected in 50 single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. Seats in the proportional part are allocated using the Hare quota, modified to ensure that every party list, which passes the threshold, receives at least one mandate.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Party lists ===\nTo register regional lists of candidates, parties need to collect 0.5% of signatures of all registered voters in Tatarstan.\nThe following parties were relieved from the necessity to collect signatures:\n\nUnited Russia\nCommunist Party of the Russian Federation\nA Just Russia — Patriots — For Truth\nLiberal Democratic Party of Russia\nNew People\nCommunists of Russia\n\n\n=== Single-mandate constituencies ===\n50 single-mandate constituencies were formed in Tatarstan.

        "content": "William Henry Ransom  (19 November 1824 – 16 April 1907) was an English physician and embryologist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRansom was born at Cromer, Norfolk, on 19 November 1824. He was the elder son of Henry Ransom, a master mariner of that town, who died in 1832. His mother, Mary Jones, was daughter of a Welsh clergyman. Educated at a private school at Norwich, Ransom was apprenticed at sixteen to a medical practitioner at King's Lynn. In 1843 he proceeded to University College, London, where Huxley was a fellow student. Writing to Herbert Spencer on 1 June 1886, Huxley points out that at the examination in 1845 Ransom came out first, winning an exhibition, and he second, with momentous results to himself. 'If Ransom,' Huxley continues, 'had worked less hard I might have been first and he second, in which case I should have obtained the exhibition, should not have gone into the navy, and should have forsaken science for practice' (Life and Letters of T. H. Huxley, 1900, ii. 133). After holding residential posts at University College Hospital, Ransom studied in Paris and Germany, graduating M.D. London in 1850. Then settling at Nottingham, he was from 1854 to 1890 physician to the Nottingham General Hospital. He became F.R.C.P. London in 1869, and fellow, respectively, of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society and University College, London, in 1854 and 1896. He was elected F.R.S. on 2 June 1870 for his knowledge of physiology and original observations in ovology, his candidature being supported among others by Huxley, Paget, and Lister.\nRansom's chief contributions to pure science were made when he was comparatively young, his later activities being absorbed in professional work. He was author of nine papers of value on embryological subjects, of which the first, 'On the Impregnation of the Ovum in the Stickleback,' appeared in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' (vol. vii. 1854–5). Another, ’On the Ovum of Osseous Fishes,' was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1867. He was interested in geology and assisted in the exploration of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire caves, reading at the first meeting of the British Association at Nottingham, in 1866, a paper 'On the Occurrence of Felis Lynx as a British Fossil.' In 1892, when the British Medical Association met there. Ransom was president of the section of medicine, his address dealing with various aspects of vegetable pathology.\nIn 1870 Ransom devised a disinfecting stove (gas-heated) for the sterilisation of infected clothing, which was used extensively till steam methods were adopted. A presidential address to the Nottingham Medico-Chirurgical Society, 'On Colds as a Cause of Disease,' delivered on 4 November 1887, attracted attention. His only independent publication, 'The Inflammation Idea in General Pathology,' appeared in 1906 (Nature, 29 November 1906; Brit. Med. Journ. 23 June 1906).\nThrough his long career at Nottingham Ransom identified himself with the welfare of the place. Zealous in support of the volunteer movement, he served for fifteen years in the 1st Notts rifle corps. Interested in educational questions, he helped in the establishment of University College, Nottingham, of the governing body of which he was a member. He died at his residence. Park Valley, Nottingham, on 16 April 1907.\nIn 1860 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Dr. John William Bramwell of North Shields, who predeceased him. They had issue four sons and one daughter. The eldest son. Dr. W. B. Ransom (b. 5 September 1860), succeeded his father as physician to the General Hospital, Nottingham, dying in 1909.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: James, T.

In 1809, he was admitted to the Bavarian nobility register as a count. In 1785, he entered the service of the Würzburg Monastery as a lieutenant and attended the Salzburg Page Training Institute Gregorianum from 1787 to 1790. He then studied law and political science at the University of Salzburg, the University of Bonn, and the University of Göttingen.\nIn 1791, he became the archbishop's chamberlain and court councilor to Hieronymus von Colloredo, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. From 1796 to 1797, he was Reich Chamber Court assessor (judge) of the Bavarian District in Wetzlar; from 1797 to 1803, he was Catholic Reich Chamber Court President; and from October 3, 1803, until the dissolution of the Reich Chamber Court on August 6, 1806, he was Reich Chamber Judge. He was the last person to hold the highest judicial office in the Old Kingdom.\nIn 1807, he came to Munich as the Real Privy Councilor and President of the Court of Justice. In 1808, he became president of the Bavarian Higher Appeal Court and, in the same year, became an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Reigersberg was one of the first three people to be awarded the Grand Cross of the newly established Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown in 1808. \nFrom 1810 on, he was Bavarian Minister of Justice and President of the Constitutional Commission. After the fall of Count Maximilian von Montgelas in 1817, he chaired the Council of Ministers and was therefore, alongside Foreign Minister Aloys Franz Xaver Graf von Rechberg and Rothenlöwen, the most influential politician under King Max I. However, he disappointed expectations and had to resign in 1823. Afterwards, he was the Imperial Councilor of the Crown of Bavaria.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKarl Theodor von Heigel: Reigersberg, Heinrich Alois Graf von. In: General German Biography (ADB).

After taking the degrees of bachelor and licentiate, he graduated M.D. on 29 May 1699. He practised in London, and in 1702 published ‘A Treatise of Vapours or Hysteric Fits,’ of which a second edition appeared in 1707. The book is dedicated to ‘the Honourable Sir John Talbott, his near relation,’ and gives a detailed clinical account of many of the phenomena of hysteria, mixed up with pathology of the school of Thomas Willis. His preface is the latest example of the type of apology for writing on medicine in the English tongue so common in books of the sixteenth century. He shows much good sense, pointing out that there are no grounds for the ancient belief that the movement of the uterus is related to the symptoms of hysteria, and supports the statement of Thomas Sydenham that similar symptoms are observable in men. Their greater frequency in women he attributes to the comparative inactivity of female life. He recommends crayfish broth and Tunbridge waters, but also seeing plays, merry company, and airing in the parks. In 1714 he published, at J. Morphew's, ‘A Treatise of the Cholick,’ dedicated to his relative, Charles, duke of Shrewsbury, of which a second edition appeared in 1715. This work shows less observation than his former book, but contains the description of an autopsy which he witnessed at Montpellier, giving the earliest observation in any English book of the irritation produced by the exudation in peritonitis on the hands of the morbid anatomist. On 3 April 1721 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London. He died on 19 December 1730.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1896). \"Purcell, John\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "A rolling stone is a method of blocking burial caves and other narrow\nBlocking stones in burial caves\nThe purpose of the stone is to prevent the intrusion of unwanted animals and visitors into the burial system.\nIn the Land of Israel, in burials from the First Temple period, square rolled stones are common, adapted as a \"stopper\" for the opening of the rock-hewn tomb system. Even when the Goll stone is not present in the area, it can be recognized that the cave was sealed with a stone by the chippings of the edge of the cave opening. Caves of this type can be seen on the slopes of Kfar Shiloh, in front of the City of David.\nIn a burial from the Second Temple period you can find round rolling stones that move on a rail and seal the opening. The stone was large and heavy, so that in order to move it from its place, the joint effort of several people was required, which was intended to make it difficult for robbers and vagabonds. Graves with such rolling stones can be seen in the Madras ruins, in a preserved burial cave on the \"Joara road\" (6954), near its intersection with road 66 and in the tombs of the kings in Jerusalem. Legends are common about special mechanisms for rolling the heavy Goll stones, but no evidence of such mechanisms has been found.\nApart from a physical barrier against the entry of pests, another purpose of the Gollel stone is to prevent the exit of impurity. The Mishnah, Tractate Aholot, Chapter 15, Mishniyot 8-9 teaches that various objects can be used as a burial roll in order to prevent impurity from leaving, but a stone does not receive impurity, thus its advantage in this matter (see also Mishna Torah to Rambam, Sefer Purity, Laws of Dead Impurity, Chapter 6).\nUse of pebbles for security purposes\nEvidence of the use of Goll stones for security purposes can be found during the Roman period in the Land of Israel. During the Bar Kochba rebellion, Goll stones were used to seal the rebels' hiding systems.\n\nIn many excavation sites in Israel, especially in sites in the mountain area from the Byzantine period in the Land of Israel, large rolling stones and rails for rolling them were discovered at the entrances of public buildings (such as synagogues). The courtyard of the building was surrounded by a stable wall and had a single and relatively narrow opening, a rail was installed at the threshold of the opening and on the sides of the opening holes were designed in the wall and in them was placed a rolling stone. This made it possible to close the place safely when not in use, which made it possible to store valuables inside. The opening of the stone could only be done jointly, which prevented intrusion into the place by a single hand. This also made it possible to create a safe gathering place for the population of the settlement, when the citizens could escape to the public house and shut themselves inside to fortify themselves against enemies.\n\n\n== References ==",

All 35 members of Worcester City Council in Worcestershire will be elected following boundary changes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWorcester has been controlled by both the Conservatives and Labour for long periods. From 1980 to 1999, Labour held a majority on the council. The Conservatives then held a majority from 2003 to 2008 after a period of no overall control, and again from 2011 to 2012.\nThe Conservatives regained control in 2015, but the council reverted to no overall control a year later; 2021 to 2022 was also a period of Conservative majority. In the previous election, the Green Party gained 5 seats with 28.4% of the vote, Labour gained 1 with 28.0%, the Liberal Democrats gained 2 with 16.3%, and the Conservatives lost all the seats they were defending with 25.4%. Following the election, Labour and the Green Party formed a majority coalition, with the party leaders serving as joint leaders of the council.\n\n\n== Boundary changes ==\nWorcester usually elects its councillors in thirds, on a 4-year cycle. However, following boundary changes, all councillors will be elected to the new wards.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nMay 2023: Simon Cronin (Labour) dies; by-election held July 2023\nJuly 2023: Elaine Willmore (Labour) holds by-election\nAugust 2023: Andy Roberts (Conservative) dies; by-election held October 2023\nOctober 2023: Katie Collier (Green Party) gains by-election from Conservatives\n\n\n== Councillors standing down ==\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Worcester Council following the close of nominations on 8 April 2024.

        "content": "Plantago udicola is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to New Zealand. Heidi Meudt and Philip Garnock-Jones described P. udicola in 2012. Plants of this species of plantain are perennial with a rosette habit, leaves widest above the middle, seeds uniform, ellipsoid and 1–4 per capsule, edges of bracts sparsely hairy, edges of sepals with isolated hairs at the apex only, and a chromosome number of 2n = 96 (dodecaploid). It is listed as Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPlantago udicola Meudt & Garn.-Jones is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. New Zealand botanists Heidi Meudt and Philip Garnock-Jones described P. udicola in 2012.\n\nThe type material was collected by Mei Lin Tay, Philip Garnock-Jones, William Malcolm & Rilka Taskova at Little Lake Sylvester, Western Nelson, South Island, New Zealand in 2007. The holotype is housed at the herbarium of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (WELT).\nPlantago udicola is morphologically most similar to P. raoulii, P. spathulata and P. picta.\nP. udicola can be distinguished from these and other New Zealand Plantago species by a suite of characters including its 1–4 uniform, ellipsoid seeds, edges of bracts sparsely hairy, edges of sepals with isolated hairs at the apex only, and a chromosome number of 2n = 96.\nP. udicola can be further distinguished from P. raoulii by the longer calyx (2.3–3.5 mm vs. 1.6–2.4 mm) and larger corolla lobes (1.2–2.9 mm long by 0.6–1.3 mm wide vs. 0.6–1.2 mm long by 0.3–0.7 mm wide).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPlantago udicola plants are small rosettes with a primary root up to 20 mm thick, with up to 19 usually narrowly angular-obovate leaves, and with visible, short to long (<24 mm long), rust-coloured leaf axillary hairs in the basal rosette. The leaves have 1–5 veins, are 16–186 mm long (including petiole) and up to 27 mm wide, usually not punctate, usually with isolated hairs or sparsely hairy on the upper surface, and usually glabrous, with isolated hairs or sparely hairy on the lower surface, particularly the midrib and edges. The leaf usually has an acute apex, and its edges are smooth or wavy or with 4–12 minute or large teeth, and with isolated hairs or sparsely hairy near the teeth. The petiole is usually distinguishable from the leaf lamina, and up to 75 mm long. Each rosette plant has up to 18 erect inflorescences which can be up to 266 mm long. The scapes are smooth and sparsely to densely hairy. The spikes are usually linear-ovoid with 2–32 densely crowded flowers. Each flower has 1 small bract that is ovate, broadly ovate or very broadly ovate that is sparsely hairy on the margins and otherwise glabrous or with isolated hairs along the midrib. The calyx is 2.2–3.5 mm long, 1.4–2.9 mm wide, with isolated hairs at the apex, otherwise glabrous. The corolla tube is 1.8–3.7 mm long, corolla lobes 1.1–2.9 mm long, stamen filaments 2.0–7.5 mm long, anthers 1.5–2.2 mm long, and style 2.2–6.4 mm long and densely hairy. The ovary is 0.6–1.8 mm long, with 4–5 ovules. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule with circumsessile dehiscence, usually ellipsoid, broadly ellipsoid, or ovoid, widest at or below middle, 2.1–4.7 mm long and 1.4–3.2 mm wide. Each capsule has 1–4 rust, brown or dark brown, uniform, rounded seeds 1.1–2.5 mm long and 0.6–1.4 mm wide, usually ellipsoid.\nPlantago udicola flowers from November to February and fruits from about December to June.\nThe chromosome number of Plantago udicola is 2n=96.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nPlantago udicola is a plantain that is endemic to the North Island and South Island of New Zealand.\nIn the North Island P. udicola is found in the Volcanic Plateau region only. In the South Island it is found in the Western Nelson, Sounds Nelson, Westland, Canterbury, Otago and Fiordland regions.\nP. udicola grows in wet or damp ground in bogs, streams or hollows on silt or peaty soil in subalpine to alpine tussock or herbfields from 580 to 1600 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nin phylogenetic analyses of Australasian species of Plantago using standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA, chloroplast DNA, and mitochondrial DNA regions) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), Plantago udicola was moderately to strongly supported as being closely related to the mainland New Zealand species P. spathulata, P. picta  and P. raoulii.\nSimilarly, the sole individual of P. udicola was closely related to individuals of P. raoulii, P. spathulata and P. picta in another phylogenetic study focusing on Plantago species throughout the world using whole chloroplast genomes. Finally, the species was not included in another phylogenetic studies focusing on oceanic island Plantago species using standard DNA sequencing markers.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nPlantago udicola is listed as Not Threatened in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Plantago udicola at Wikimedia Commons\nPlantago udicola occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "Richard Powell (1767 – 18 August 1834) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPowell was the son of Joseph Powell of Thame, Oxfordshire. He was baptised on 11 May 1767, and in 1781 was elected a scholar at Winchester. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, on 19 January 1785, but subsequently migrated to Merton College, where he graduated B.A. 23 October 1788, M.A. 31 October 1791, M.B. 12 July 1792, and M.D. 20 January 1795. He studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was one of the founders of the Literary and Philosophical Society there, which was afterwards named the Abernethian Society. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians 30 September 1796, and in 1799 delivered there the Gulstonian lectures. They were published in 1800, under the title of ‘Observations on the Bile and its Diseases, and on the Œconomy of the Liver,’ and show careful observation and sound judgment. The method of clinical examination of the liver which he proposes is excellent; and he is the first English medical writer who demonstrates that gallstones may remain fixed in the neck of the gall-bladder, or even obliterate its cavity, without well-marked symptoms or serious injury to the patient. On the resignation of Dr. Richard Budd, he was, on 14 August 1801, elected physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, an office which he retained till 1824. He was a censor at the College of Physicians in 1798, 1807, 1820, and 1823; was Lumleian lecturer from 1811 to 1822; and delivered the Harveian oration in 1808. He had considerable chemical knowledge, and published ‘Heads of Lectures on Chemistry’ in 1796. He was one of the revisers of the ‘Pharmacopœia Londinensis’ in 1809, and published a translation of that edition. On 30 September 1808 he was appointed secretary to the commissioners for regulating madhouses, and on 13 April 1810 he read, at the College of Physicians, ‘Observations upon the Comparative Prevalence of Insanity at Different Periods,’ afterwards published in the ‘Medical Transactions of the College of Physicians of London,’ vol. iv. In the same volume he published ‘Observations on the Internal Use of Nitrate of Silver,’ in which he recommends its use in chorea and in epilepsy, an opinion which he modified in a subsequent paper on further cases of the same diseases, read on 17 April 1815. On 20 December 1813 he read ‘Observations upon some cases of Paralytic Affection’ (Medical Transactions, vol. v.), in which simple facial palsy was for the first time described. Sir Charles Bell, in the course of his researches on the nervous system, afterwards redescribed and explained this affection; but the credit of its first clinical description belongs to Powell, who also initiated a method of treatment by warm applications which became commonly used, and is often efficacious. In the following year (2 Dec.) he read ‘Some Cases illustrative of the Pathology of the Brain,’ a description of thirteen cases of interest. In the course of the paper he describes several diseases which have since become well known, but had then scarcely been noticed—such as hæmatoma of the dura mater, meningitis following necrosis of the walls of the inner ear, and new growth of the pituitary gland. On 7 May 1818 he read a paper ‘On certain Painful Affections of the Alimentary Canal’ (Med. Trans. vi. 106), which describes a variety of acute but recurring enteric inflammation associated with the formation of flakes of false membrane. He also published an account of a case of hydrophobia. He gave some attention to the study of the history of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and on 27 November 1817 a letter from him to Dr. William George Maton was read, describing the most ancient charter preserved in the hospital and its seal. He printed for the first time the whole text of this charter (Archæologia, vol. xix.), which is a grant from Rahere in 1137. Powell lived in Bedford Place, London, for some years, and, after he retired from practice, in York Terrace, Regent's Park, where he died on 18 August 1834. His portrait was hung in the committee-room of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1896). \"Powell, Richard\".

        "content": "Mohammed Rahim Khan (1775–1825), was the second Khan (and fourth ruler) of the Uzbek Kungrat dynasty in the Khanate of Khiva. He reigned from 1806 to 1825.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe ascended the throne after the tragic death in battle of his elder brother Eltuzar who had reigned from 1804 to 1806. He himself had managed to escape to Khiva, after the failure of the raid against the Emirate of Bukhara in which Eltuzar drowned in the Amu Darya.\n\n\n=== Internal policy ===\nIn order to strengthen and develop the power of the State in a country subjected to anarchy for almost a century, Mohammed Rahim Khan launched a series of important reforms. He founded a High Council to improve administration, reformed taxes and brought order to the customs system. He is the first Kungrat sovereign to mint gold and silver coins. The Khanate previously mainly used the currency of the Emirate of Bukhara.\nHe pursued an economic development policy, in particular by improving and developing the irrigation system.\n\n\n=== External policy ===\nIn 1808–1809, he led an expedition against the Chovdur tribe. In 1811, he finally subdued the Uzbek tribes of the Amu Darya delta who had broken away from Khiva. He also subdued the Kazakh tribes of the lower Syr Darya in 1812-1813 and in the 1820s, he conquered the city of Merv.\nMohammed Rahim strengthened diplomatic ties with the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Afghan Empire. It was especially with the latter country that ties became very friendly, when Afghan Emir Mahmud Shah Durrani took refuge in Khiva between 1803 and 1809. When he regained his throne, he granted privileges to the merchants of the Khanate of Khiva so that they could trade without hindrance in his country.\nThe Russian envoy Nikolay Muravyov-Karsky was dispatched to his court in Khiva in 1819-1820 and in 1822 he published a book on his trip. According to him, the Khanate then had a population of 300,000 inhabitants, most of them Uzbeks or Turkmen.\nA second Russian diplomatic mission was sent to Khiva in 1820. It was headed by Aleksandr Negri.\n\n\n=== Cultural influence ===\n\nIn addition to his native Uzbek language, Mohammed Rahim also spoke Persian and Arabic. He strived during his reign to protect the sciences and the arts. He built the Kutlugmurad Inak Madrasah, the Bogʻbonli mosque, and other buildings. He ordered a new throne in 1815, covered with silver plates and decorated with arabesques. It is now in a museum in Moscow. The Khivaite historian Mounis Khorezmi was working on his History of Khorezm at this time.\n\n\n=== Death and succession ===\nMohammed Rahim's son, Allah Kuli Khan (1794–1842), succeeded him to the throne of the Khanate of Khiva after his death in 1825.\nAnother son, Sayyid Muhammad (1823–1864), would succeed Kutlug Murad Khan, the last grandson of Allah Kuli Khan, who died aged 18 in 1856.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGulomov Kh.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Japanese Invasion of Malabang was part of the Japanese landings on the western coast of Mindanao that began on April 29, 1942. Kawaguchi Detachment landed in three important points in west coast of Mindanao including Malabang in then undivided Lanao Province. Defending forces of Filipino and American troops resisted but due to lack of artillery pieces and Japanese Naval and Air support they were overwhelmed and forced to retreat most of the time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter securing Panay Island, General Homma ordered General Kawaguchi to Mindanao. He was to land in Lanao sector of Mindanao Force which was under the command of Brigadier General Guy O. Fort. Kawaguchi's naval convoy was soon spotted in the Zamboanga sector and reported to Mindanao Force HQ on April 27, 1942, at which time Fort warned his troops of the imminent invasion from his command post at Camp Kiethley.\nKawaguchi arrived and landed in Malabang on April 29, 1942. Opposing them was the 61st Infantry Regiment under Colonel Eugene T. Mitchell. Attached to the 61st was a 2-gun battery of QF 2.95 inch Mountain Guns commanded by Captain Albert Price and a PC Company based in Momungan.\n\n\n=== Combat Narratives ===\nThe 3rd Battalion, 61st Infantry under Major Ernest E. McLish was deployed north of Malabang Air Field astride to Ganassi Road while the 2nd Battalion 61st Infantry under Captain Clyde Childress was posted astride the Maladig River. The 1st Battalion under Major Moran was held in reserve near Lake Dapao.\nThe Japanese landed in Banago southeast of Malabang and used the docks to land their tanks. They moved forward in an effort to quickly capture the Mataling River Bridge.\nRegimental headquarters moved from Ganassi to left side of the reserve Battalion. Mitchell requested to blow up the bridge but Fort declined as the bridge was needed to give the 2nd Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Calixto Duque a way to retreat from Parang.\nMitchell reported to General Fort that a convoy of more than 20 trucks full of Japanese soldiers with tanks and scout cars left from Parang, Cotabato to Malabang. \n\n\n==== Retreat to Dansalan ====\n\nMitchell rounded up men to establish a holiday position. General Fort informed him of giving him 1st Battalion, 84th Infantry under Major Jay Navin. Again rained down on the Filipino on this position with mortars, artilleries, and machine gun fire. Mitchell established another line but before they could finish their earth works the Japanese struck again which scattered his exhausted, tired, dispirited men. This time Colonel Mitchell was captured, 61st Infantry was routed and capture of its commander gave Japanese full control of Route 1 towards Lake Lanao.\n\n\n=== Moro Battalions ===\n\nGeneral Fort's confidence with Moro Battalions was justified when they ambushed a battalion size Japanese force travelling from Ganassi to Lumbatan. Led by Captain Mamalinta Lao, they annihilated the Japanese with only two Moros lost. Another Moro unit under Lieutenant Muhammad Ali Dimaporo and Captain Busran Kalaw continuously harassed the Japanese.\n\n\n==== Reinforcement ====\nFort ordered Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Vessey to move down one of his battalions in Bacolod to support Mitchell. Upon reaching Ganassi, Vessey with his executive officer Tisdale and Private Childress moved farther to do reconnaissance but were met by a tank who fired at their vehicle. Vessey was able to returned to Gannasi and appointed Commander Robert Strong, USN as his executive officer thinking Tisdale and his driver were killed during the ambush. It was later known that Tisdale died in the jungle trying to reach 73rd Infantry Line. Lieutenant Colonel Naidas of Philippine Constabulary was ordered by Fort to establish a line from Tamparan to Taloan Hill using whatever troops he could find and deny entry to the Japanese into the east coast of the lake.\nJapanese advance resumed on May 3 towards Bacolod with motorized column with four tanks spearheading at the 73rd Infantry's position. Direct fire from Captain Price's detachment caught the leading tank and putting it out of commission, confusing the Japanese column. However, the Japanese got air support from Zamboanga forcing the 73rd Infantry into successive withdrawals. In Dansalan, the 73rd Infantry with remnants of the 61st Infantry established another line to deprive the Japanese of Route 1 and link with the Kawamura Detachment.\n\n\n== Execution of Jose Abad Santos ==\n\nChief Justice Jose Abad Santos of the Philippine Commonwealth was captured in Barangay Tubod, Barili, Cebu, while riding in an automobile with his son, Jose Jr (Pepito), and his aide, Lieutenant Colonel Benito Valeriano. He was brought to a Japanese Camp in Basak San Nicolas, Cebu City, where the Japanese attempted to persuade him to collaborate with them. However, when he was brought to Lanao by Kawaguchi on May 1, 1942, he was informed of his execution order. He was executed in May 1, 1942 and was hastily buried. Markings were allowed on his grave.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe troops in Lanao sector was still fighting when orders from General Sharp reached General Fort to surrender on May 10, 1942. Many questioned the order as his unit was still successful in fighting the Japanese. His troops, who were both Americans and Filipinos, were still giving a good fight. However, Sharp warned that any American who disobeyed his order would be court martialed. Fort surrendered on May 12, 1942 and combat operations ceased in Lanao Sector. \n\n\n=== Death March and Fort's execution ===\nAfter surrender of troops in Lanao Sector by its commander General Fort in May 12, 1942, the Japanese forced the Filipino American troops to walk without water and food from Dansalan to Iligan. POWs in very poor condition walked 136km from Camp Keithley in Dansalan to Camp Overton in Iligan. Americans were tied by four per column and Filipinos, although not bound, were made to walk barefoot, and some were executed on the road. This event was known as the Mindanao Death March.\nAfter General Fort's surrender, he was shipped north on the small freighter Maru San alongside other captive generals, including his commander Sharp plus Joseph P. Vachon and Manuel Roxas. After the war, Roxas would become the first president of the Philippines. Fort was then escorted by the Kempeitai to Manila, where he remained for several months. In November 1942 the Japanese sought Fort's help in talking to the Moro people, who were still fighting the Japanese. Specifically, Fort was supposed to tell the Moro that since the U.S. Army had surrendered they must also surrender. Fort was brought from Manila back to Marawi (then known as Dansalan) on Mindanao to tell the Moro to surrender. However, Fort refused to cooperate and was executed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See Also ===\nMindanao Force\n61st Infantry Regiment\n81st Infantry Division\nGuy O.

        "content": "Raidongia Doul or Raidongia Dol\nis a historical doul located in the Lejai-Kalakhowa area of Dibrugarh district. It was built in 1750 by the Ahom king Swargadeo Pramatta Singha (1744–1751). Initially it was a Devi Temple. Over time, a house was built near the doul and the people of the area started to worship Shiva. Therefore, the present doul is also known as Shiv Doul or Raidongia Shiv Doul. Its main festival is Maha Shivratri. The Archaeological Department of the Government of Assam has recognized the Raidongia Doul as a State Protected Monument.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Raidongia Daul is located in Lejai Miripathar village under Larua Mouza of Barbarua Revenue Circle in Dibrugarh district. It is situated approximately 22 km from Dibrugarh. The temple is connected to the main road by a historical road known as Raidongia Road, which starts from Lejai-Kalakhowa road. The temple is situated on the north side of Raidongia Road and west of the main Lejai-Kalakhowa road.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe foundation stone of the temple was laid in 1742 by Swargadeo Pramatta Singha (1744–1751) of the Ahom kingdom. The temple is known to have been offered as a dowry in the name of his beloved sister, Yamini, who was married to the Raidongia king, considered to be the head of the present Lejai region at that time. The doul was completed in the late 1750s with the cooperation of the local villagers. A total of 200 puras of land were dedicated to the temple. Along with the daul, a pond was also dug during that period. The pond is still next to the doul.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Raidongia Daul is a combination of Ahom and Nilachal architectural styles. This doul is based on an octagonal altar. The main peak is 45 feet high and has eight small peaks surrounding the polygonal main peak. The walls of the main peak of the brick doul contain numerous sculptures depicting various gods and goddesses, giving clear representations of Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki respectively. There are also rock sculptures of Brahma, Vishnu and Lakshmi, as well as various forms of Goddess Durga. Traditional raw materials such as duck eggs, ground porridge, and Bora rice were used in the construction of the temple. The chakra located on the dome above the daul is marked with four projecting tridents. Additionally, there are numerous sculptures of gods and goddesses and Shivlings in the courtyard of the daul. There are 24 ancient relics and 14 statues of the Ahom kingdom.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe priest of the doul performs regular pujas dedicated to Lord Shiva. Every year, Maha Shivratri is celebrated here on the fourteenth day of the Krishna Paksha in the month of Phalguna according to the Hindu calendar. On this occasion, devotees and pilgrims from various parts of the country come here to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. Surrounded by paddy fields, the doul is known as a habitat for various migratory birds. Its natural beauty fascinates visitors to the place.\nIt is located approximately 22 km from Dibrugarh city on the Lejai-Kalakhowa road and is well connected from Dibrugarh city. The Dibrugarh railway station is about 28 km away, and Dibrugarh Airport is about 37 km away.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was preselected by the Liberal National Party (LNP) on 8 July 2012 to contest the division of Blair at the 2013 federal election. She was unsuccessful, with incumbent Labor MP Shayne Neumann re-elected with a 1.02% two-party-preferred swing towards him.\nShe re-contested Blair for the LNP in 2016, and again was unsuccessful with a 3.62% two-party-preferred swing away from her.\nAt the 2020 Queensland local government elections, Harding contested the mayoralty of Ipswich City Council following more than a year of the council being under administration. She was elected with 62.98% of the vote after preferences, becoming the first non-Labor aligned Ipswich mayor in 50 years.\nHarding was re-elected in 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHarding's husband, Steven Voll, has also served in the RAAF as an air field defence guard at RAAF Base Amberley. He was deloyed to Afghanistan two days after Harding was announced as an LNP candidate in 2013.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karl Ganser (15 September 1937, Mindelheim – 21 April 2022, Breitenthal) was a German geographer, urban planner, and former managing director of the International Architecture Exhibition Emscher Park.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKarl Ganser was born the son of a farmer. After studying chemistry, biology, and geography at the Technical University of Munich, Ganser completed his doctorate in 1964 with a dissertation on \"A socio-geographical division of the city of Munich based on election results. Possibilities of a socio-spatial division of cities based on the behavior of the population in political elections\" and in the same year became an assistant and lecturer at the Geographical Institute of the TH Munich.\nIn 1967, Ganser moved to the urban development department of the city of Munich as project manager. He habilitated in 1970, and in 1971, he became the head of the Institute for Regional Studies in Bonn. He merged it with the Institute for Regional Planning to form the then Federal Research Institute for Regional Studies and Regional Planning Federal Research Institute for Regional Studies and Regional Planning (now part of the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning), of which he remained director until 1980. From 1980 to 1989, he was head of urban planning at the Ministry for Regional and Urban Development of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nFrom 1989 to 2000, Ganser held the position of managing director of the International Architecture Exhibition Emscher Park (IBA). As IBA managing director, he focused on transformation of old industrial areas and the restoration of the landscape in the Emscher Landschaftspark. He also advocated for the preservation of industrial heritage and prevented the demolition of the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex in Essen, the Gasometer Oberhausen, the Jahrhunderthalle in Bochum, the Kokerei Hansa in Dortmund, and the Meiderich Steelworks in Duisburg-Meiderich (now a central part of the Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord). Ganser's achievement was to give new meaning to the industrial age buildings and to enable unforeseen uses: the largest gas holder in Europe was turned into an exhibition hall, and a steelworks was declared a landscape park.\nGanser retired in 1999 but continued to work as a publicist, expert, and mediator. He was appointed as a mediator in the dispute over the Waldschlößchen Bridge in Dresden. Throughout his career, Ganser focused on the preservation of industrial monuments, including the Gaswerk Augsburg, and to urban renewal projects. He also focused on ecological issues. In 2011, Ganser provided consulting services for the restoration of the Sayner Hütte in Bendorf on the Middle Rhine.\n\n\n== Honors and Awards ==\nIn 1999, Ganser received an honorary doctorate from the Ruhr University Bochum, particularly for his work as \"one of the architects of the new Ruhr area\". In 2003, Ganser received the Staatspreis des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen. He received an honorary title Citizen of the Ruhr Area since 1995 and was made an honorary member of the Association of German Architects (BDA) in 1997. In 2001, he was awarded the Cultural Groschen of the German Cultural Council, which he refused to accept in protest against the destruction of the industrial monument Vockerode.\nIn 2007, Karl Ganser received the Bavarian Nature Conservation Prize for his commitment to urban renewal projects, land conservation, and nature and environmental protection. His work at the International Building Exhibition Emscher Park from 1989 to 1999, where he initiated a circular economy in land and energy consumption, building stock, and water management based on the principle of \"transformation without growth,\" was particularly mentioned.\n\n\n== Selected Works ==\nIndustrial Culture in Augsburg.

        "content": "Translated from Love is a 2007 studio album by American country musician Kelly Willis. The album came after a long hiatus, received positive reviews by critics, and placed on several charts.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Translated from Love received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 from 10 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that \"this is, in many ways, as slick as her MCA records, though it is punchier, rocks a little harder, and feels like it was geared for more open-minded country radio stations\" and continues that Chuck Prophet is \"a perfect producer for getting what an artist wants out of a tune\", summarizing that \"it's a winner, a solid, consistently crafted \"new country\" record that wears rock & roll proudly on its sleeve\". Doug Freeman of The Austin Chronicle gave this album 3 out of 5 stars, writing that the \"songs are forged with a more mature fire and relaxed tone\" than Willis' previous work. In Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman scored Translated from Love a B+, calling it \"a treat in any emotional language\". A review in No Depression ended, \"But the way she follows the metaphors of giving in to the unpredictable nature of love, with the feel of someone fully awake to feeling, submits to no translation. She really just sounds just like herself.\" Rolling Stone's Robert Christgau rated this work 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating that \"her good taste tethers her to the old homestead\". Jonathan Keefe gave this album 4 out of 5 stars in Slant Magazine, summing up that \"While it lacks the thematic focus of its two predecessors (2002’s Easy and 1999’s extraordinary What I Deserve), Translated From Love compensates with its deliberate, measured quirk; it still has the depth her fans have come to expect, but it’s Willis’s coolest record yet\". Translated from Love received an 8 out of 10 at PopMatters where it was characterized as \"a kick in the pants compared to the relatively mellow Easy\". Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post wrote that \"Willis's emergence from [a] hiatus feels less than focused, as Translated presents a scattered collection of styles and tempos that never quite jell\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Nobody Wants to Go to the Moon Anymore\" (Damon Bramblett) – 2:53\n\"Sweet Little One\" (Chuck Prophet and Kelly Willis) – 3:55\n\"Don’t Know Why\" (Prophet, Jules Shear, Willis) – 3:37\n\"Teddy Boys\" (Willis) – 2:44\n\"Losing You\" (Prophet and Willis) – 3:34\n\"Too Much to Lose\" (Prophet, Shear, and Willis) – 4:33\n\"The More That I'm Around You\" (Shear) – 3:34\n\"Sweet Sundown\" (Bramblett) – 3:01\n\"Success\" (David Bowie, Ricky Gardiner, and Iggy Pop) – 3:44\n\"Stone’s Throw Away\" (Greg Leisz, Prophet, and Willis) – 4:18\n\"I Must Be Lucky\" (Prophet, Shear, and Willis) – 3:01\n\"Translated from Love\" (Stephen Yerkey) – 2:19\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKelly Willis – vocals, harmony vocals on \"Sweet Little One\" and \"Losing You\"\nStephanie Ames Asbell – viola on \"Sweet Little One\", \"Losing You\", \"Too Much to Lose\", and \"Stone’s Throw Away\"\nAdam Ayan – audio mastering at Gateway Mastering\nClaude Bernard – backing vocals on \"Sweet Sundown\"\nMike Hardwick – dobro on \"I Must Be Lucky\"\nAndrew Hernandez – audio engineering\nPhil Hill – audio engineering\nMax Johnston – backing vocals on \"Sweet Sundown\"\nPaul Q.

        "content": "The 2020 Ipswich City Council election was held on 28 March 2020 to elect a mayor and eight councillors to the City of Ipswich. The election was held as part of the statewide local elections in Queensland, Australia.\nTeresa Harding was elected mayor with 62.98% of the vote after preferences, becoming the first non-Labor Party aligned Ipswich mayor in 50 years.\nThe election saw significant changes to the council's electoral system, and followed its dismissal in August 2018.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== 2017 mayoral by-election ===\n\nOn 6 June 2017, mayor Paul Pisasale announced his resignation, citing a decline in his health due to multiple sclerosis. The announcement came one day after his office was searched by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission and police.\nAndrew Antoniolli was elected mayor with 54.44% of the vote after preferences.\n\n\n=== 2018 dismissal ===\nIn May 2018, Antoniolli was charged with seven counts of corruption forcing him to stand down and administrators to take over Ipswich City Council.\nIn August 2018, the Queensland Government passed legislation to dismiss all Ipswich councillors and replace them with an administrator. The dismissal officially came into effect on 21 August.\nGreg Chemello was appointed as administrator to serve for the rest of the term.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nPrior to 2020, Ipswich City Council was composed of a directly elected mayor and 10 single-member wards (or divisions), both using optional preferential voting.\nIn July 2019, it was announced that the 10 single-member wards would be replaced by four two-member wards, reducing the total amount of councillors to eight. Preferential voting was removed and replaced by plurality block voting (also referred to as first-past-the-post by the Electoral Commission), where voters are only required to mark the same amount of candidates as there are positions to be elected − in the case of Ipswich, two candidates.\nThe electoral system for mayor was unchanged.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nTeresa Harding, a government contractor and former two-time Liberal National candidate for Blair, contested the mayoral election without any party endorsement.\nTwo Labor Party members, Mark Williams and Ursula Monsiegneur, contested the mayoral election as Independent Labor candidates.\nPat Walsh was endorsed by the Greens to contest the mayoralty. The Liberal Democrats endorsed two councillor candidates, husband and wife Anthony and Jacinta Bull.\nPaul Tully, who served as a councillor for 39 years until its dismissal, led the \"Your Voice Of Experience\" ticket in Division 2.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n=== Councillors ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dog Show is the 10th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 12 December 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFor the annual All-Breed Dog Show, George Liquor, the abusive owner of Ren and Stimpy, has entered his pets into the show despite the fact that Stimpy is a cat. George is only willing to love his pets if they are \"champions\" and subjects both of his pets to various cruelties such as cutting off Ren's tail. In the first stage of the contest, Mr. Horse rejects both Ren and Stimpy, but George berates him with such force that Ren and Stimpy make it to the finale. George tells Ren to win to \"make my dreams come true!\", but Ren mocks him instead. Ren tells George that he should enter the Dog Show competition, which George does, calling himself the rare Royal American George Hound. Despite the fact that George is not a dog, he wins the prize trophy while Ren and Stimpy embrace and say \"oh joy!\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nGeorge Liquor-voice of Michael Pataki\nPoodle-voice of Harris Peet\nThe Salesman-voice of Billy Wst\nMr. Horse-voice of John Kricfalusi\nFat Lady-voice of John Kricfalusi\n\n\n== Production ==\nDog Show had an extremely troubled production even by the standards of The Ren & Stimpy Show and was the subject of a fierce disputes between the showrunner, John Kricfalusi and the producer, Vanessa Coffey for the entire first half of 1992 over its contents. The judges of the dog show were originally depicted as stereotypically effeminate gay men, and George Liquor made a number of blatantly homophobic remarks. Coffrey ordered the judges to be replaced with the Mr. Horse and Salesmen characters, which delayed the episode. A number of George's homophobic remarks were removed, but others such as his statement to the judge \"keep this strictly professional Mack\" were retained, but left out of context. Dog Show was scheduled to air on 5 September 1992, but did not finally appear on the air until 12 December 1992.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski wrote that Dog Show was a far inferior episode compared to the other 1992 episode that featured the George Liquor character, Man's Best Friend.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013). Slimed! An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Golden Age. London: Penguin Publishing Group. ISBN 9781101614099.\nKomorowski, Thad (2017). Sick Little Monkeys: The Unauthorized Ren & Stimpy Story.

        "content": "Pule Mmodi (born 23 February 1993) is a South African soccer player who plays as a winger for Kaizer Chiefs in the Premier Soccer League.\nHe signed for Uthongathi in 2018 as a part of a large influx of new players. While he played for Uthongathi, it was reported that Doctor Khumalo scouted him for Kaizer Chiefs. He was instead picked up by Lamontville Golden Arrows for the belated start of the 2020-21 South African Premier Division. The club described him as a \"very tricky, quick and skillful attacking midfielder\". \nMmodi's first callup to the South African national team was hampered by his not having a passport, as he had never imagined he would travel outside South Africa. He later received more call-ups, and played two friendly matches in 2022 and one in 2023. Making his first-tier debut at the age of 27 and impressing in 2021–22, he was also called a \"late bloomer\".\nIn September 2022, before the closing of the summer transfer window, Mmodi was nearing a transfer to Kaizer Chiefs. It fell through because Chiefs would not meet the Arrows' asking price. The Arrows' manager commented him for remaining dedicated to the club.\nHowever, Mmodi's contract would expire in the summer of 2023. AmaZulu voiced their interest in the player. Rumours ensued about a swap deal with Kaizer Chiefs during the winter transfer window. The transfer to Kaizer Chiefs finally took place in the summer of 2023. Mmodi attracted attention for changing his player agent on the same day his contract with Golden Arrows had expired and he signed for Kaizer Chiefs.\nIn his home debut, he also scored his first goal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Laurence Holker Potts (18 April 1789 – 23 March 1850) was an English inventor and physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPotts son of Cuthbert Potts, surgeon, and Ethelinda Margaret Thorpe, daughter of John Thorpe, M.D., F.S.A. He was born in Pall Mall, London, on 18 April 1789. He was educated at Westminster School and at a school in Northamptonshire, and in 1805 he was apprenticed to Mr. Birch, surgeon, of Warwick. In 1810 he was entered at St. George's Hospital and became a house-pupil of Sir Benjamin Brodie; William Frederick Chambers and (Sir) Charles Locock were house-pupils at the same time. He passed the College of Surgeons in 1812, and graduated M.D. at Aberdeen in 1825. In 1812 he was appointed surgeon to the Royal Devon and Cornwall miners militia, then quartered in Ireland. The regiment returned to Truro in 1814, and was subsequently disbanded, Potts starting in practice in the town. He had always taken much interest in scientific pursuits, and in 1818 took an active part in founding the Royal Institution of Cornwall. He gave several courses of lectures there, and was in the habit of making gratuitous analyses of minerals for the miners. In 1828 he became superintendent and physician of the Cornwall county lunatic asylum at Bodmin. This appointment he resigned in 1837, removing in the following year to Vanbrugh Castle, Blackheath, where he established an institution for the treatment of spinal diseases. Here he established a workshop for the manufacture of the various appliances and apparatus, of which he devised many new forms. He had at the same time a town house in Buckingham Street, Strand, to which a workshop was attached. His increasing interest in his inventions diverted his attention from his patients, and Vanbrugh Castle was eventually given up. In 1843 he took out a patent (No. 9642) for conveying letters on a railway formed by suspending wires or light rods from distant points, making use of church towers, or any other lofty structures available. The patent also includes a velocipede and a boat propelled by paddles worked by hand. He was also the author of many minor inventions. But the invention with which his name is closely connected is for a method of sinking foundations, for which he obtained a patent in 1843 (No. 9975). It consists in the sinking of hollow piles of iron, open at the lower end and closed at the top by a cap. A partial vacuum being then formed within the tube by means of a pump, the shingle, sand, &c., are caused to flow up through the pile by the pressure of the atmosphere, the rush of water from below breaking up the soil and undermining the lower edges of the pile. The pile descends by its own gravity, assisted by the pressure of the air on its closed end, and when it is filled, the contents are discharged by a pump. As the tube descends the cap is removed and a fresh length attached. The tubes may be of large size, when they practically become coffer-dams. The invention was well received, and at first it promised to be a great success. Potts gave evidence on 10 June 1844 before the royal commission on harbours of refuge (cf. Report, p. 119), when Mr. James Walker, president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a member of the commission, spoke very highly of the new method. The matter was taken up by the Trinity Board, and on 16 July 1845 an experimental tube, two feet six inches diameter, was driven to a depth of twenty-two feet into the Goodwin Sands in two or three hours. This was intended to form the foundation of a beacon, which, however, does not seem to have been completed until 26 August 1847, when it was announced to mariners (Mechanics' Magazine, 9 August 1845, p. 96; Civil Engineers' and Architects' Journal, December 1847, p. 388). Several small beacons were erected on sands lying near the mouth of the Thames in 1845–6 (cf. Findlay's paper in Transactions of the Society of Arts, 15 December 1847, lvi. 269).\nIn 1845 Potts became acquainted with Charles Fox of the firm of Fox & Henderson, who spent a considerable sum of money upon the invention, and used it wherever they had an opportunity (Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, xxvii. 301). The first large work upon which it was employed was the viaduct which carries the Chester and Holyhead railway across Maeldreath Bay in the Isle of Anglesey. Nineteen tubes, one foot diameter and sixteen feet long, were successfully sunk in the sand during the summer of 1846. A full account of this undertaking, with engravings, is given in the ‘Civil Engineers' and Architects' Journal,’ (December 1847, p. 388). It was also employed successfully for sinking the piers for a railway bridge over the Ouse at Huntingdon, but it failed at the bridge over the Nen at Peterborough, in consequence of the presence of boulders in the clay forming the river-bed. The foundations for the South-Western railway bridge over the Thames, between Datchet and Windsor, were laid by Potts's method; but on 12 August 1849, when the line was ready to be opened, one of the tubes suddenly sank, causing a fracture in the girder resting upon it (Times, 14 Aug. 1849, p. 3). G. W. Hemans tried it with cylinders ten feet diameter in 1850, during the construction of a bridge over the Shannon at Athlone, on the Midland Great Western railway of Ireland, but the expense of pumping out the air was very considerable, and much trouble was caused by boulders, which the trial borings had failed to indicate (cf. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, xxi. 265, xxvii. 301, 305, xxviii. 349, 353, l. 131; Humber, Bridges, 3rd edit. pp. 180, 247; Civil Engineers' and Architects' Journal, December 1850, p. 392; Burnell's Supplement to Weale's Theory of Bridges, 1850, p. 100).\nPotts read a paper on his method before the Society of Arts on 10 May 1848, for which he received the Isis gold medal (Transactions, lvi. 441). He devoted the last years of his life almost exclusively to the perfecting of his invention, upon which he expended a very considerable fortune. Unhappily, it was not a financial success; and experience has proved that its application is very limited. It is rarely used now (cf. Newman, Cylinder Bridge Piers, 1893, p. 41). It had, however, one very important result, as it incidentally gave rise to the system of sinking foundations by compressed air, an invention of great importance. It was intended to employ Potts's method to sink the piers of Rochester Bridge (commenced about 1849), but it was found that the river-bed was encumbered with the remains of a very ancient bridge, and that the cylinders could not be forced through the obstructions. It then occurred to Mr. J. Hughes, the engineer in charge of the work, to reverse the process, and to pump air into the cylinders to force the water out, so that the men could work at the bottom of the cylinders, as in a diving-bell. As the material was excavated from the space covered by the cylinders they sank by their own weight. An ‘air-lock’ provided the means of ingress and egress to the cylinders. An account of the work was read by Hughes before the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1851 (cf. Proceedings, x. 353, also published separately). It was afterwards pointed out that the same method had been previously used in France, though on a very small scale.\nPotts died on 23 March 1850. He married, in 1820, Miss Anne Wright, of Lambessow, Cornwall. Four daughters and two sons, John Thorpe and Benjamin L. F., both of whom were trained as engineers at the London Works, Smethwick, near Birmingham, under Fox & Henderson, survived him.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Prosser, Richard Bissell (1896). \"Potts, Laurence Holker\".

He was a research associate at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College of London in 2000 and 2003 respectively. He has been widely cited and recognised among the scholars worldwide.\nHe was a visiting fellow at the Department of Sociology, Hyderabad Central University and the Department of History, University of Calcutta.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHe received his bachelor's degree in Chinese language, philosophy, and political science from Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. He also earned a master's degree in sociology from the Centre for the Study of Social Systems. In 1992, the same centre awarded him an M.Phil. and a Ph.D. on the topic of nationalism, religion, and peasant politics in post-colonial India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh against the backdrop of colonial experiences.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe started his academic career by teaching in the sociology department of Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. He was associated as a fellow with the University of Calcutta, Hyderabad Central University, Charles Wallace India Trust, and the University College of London.\nPresently, he is an associate researcher at the Centre de Sciences Humaines (CSH-Delhi).\n\n\n== Work & Reception ==\nHe has worked across the different thematic in sociology.\n\n\n=== Social history of South Asian medicine & health ===\nHis studies focus on how modern medicine in the sub-continent has emerged and what the main factors and conditions made it possible. In this discussion, colonialism and communalism have been also referenced. Many scholars around the world have referenced his work in this debate and discussion.\nUnani medicine and its practices were his prior subject area. He searched and read out the maximum related sources in Urdu & Persian. He came out with a thesis that 'Unani' was a pluralist medical practice.\nThe 'Doctory' as a concept has been introduced by him. This concept tells that the modern medicine, which became closely associated with colonialism, was known in the Indian subcontinent as \"Doctory\" or Daktari Ilaj. The doctor and Doctory Ilaaj became powerful symbols of colonialism and the colonial state. The doctor was one of the most visible representatives of European knowledge; he was not the Hakim; he looked, dressed, and spoke differently; he created an aura and mystery around himself; he symbolised' modern' medicine; in fact, having a doctor visit became a mark of high status and modernity.\n\n\n=== Colonialism ===\nHe studies the historical influence of colonial politics on traditional medical systems like Unani and the resistance within these systems against such influences.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDoctory (Daktari)\nSocial History of Medicine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Antokudai Site (安徳台遺跡)  is a archaeological site with the traces of a Yayoi period settlement, located in the city of  Nakagawa,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2019.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Antokudai site is  contains the remains of a large-scale village that existed from the early middle to early late Yayoi period, or approximately 2000 years ago.  Research to date has uncovered the remains of more than 130 residences and numerous burial mounds, including one of the largest pit dwellings in Japan with a diameter of more than 15 meters, as well as remains of pit dwellings where metal casting-related artifacts such as bronze molds, and tools reused from imported iron axes have been unearthed. In addition to Yayoi pottery, artifacts have included glass magatama , iron swords and daggers and shell bracelets made from Sinustrombus latissimus shells, which are only found in the South Pacific. In one of the graves, a shell bracket was found still attached to the human skeleton's right arm, and a glass item believed to have been used as a hair ornament was also found near the skull. It is believed that this was the central village where the rulers of the country of Nakoku (奴国, Nakoku, Na-no-Kuni), which is mentioned in ancient Chinese records. resided.\nAccording to the Book of the Later Han, in 57 CE, Emperor Guangwu of Han granted Nakoku an imperial seal, patterned after the Chinese jade seals, but made of gold: the king of Na gold seal.\nIn return, that same year, Na sent envoys to the Chinese capital, offering tribute and formal New Year's greetings. This seal was discovered over 1500 years later, by an Edo period farmer on Shikanoshima Island, thus helping to verify the existence of Nakoku, which was otherwise known only from the ancient chronicles. Engraved upon it are the Chinese characters 漢委奴國王 (Kan no Wa no Na-no-Koku-ō, \"King of the Na state of the Wa (vassal) of Han\". \nA reference is found in vol. 30 of the Chinese Book of Wei from the Records of the Three Kingdoms,  titled \"The Account of the Easterners: A Note on the Wa\" (Chinese: 東夷傳‧倭人條), to the continued existence of Nakoku in the 3rd century, naming the officials and stating that it contains over 20,000 homes. This section is  known in Japan as the Gishi Wajinden (魏志倭人伝, Records of Wei: An Account of the Wa).\nThe site is located approximately 4.6 kilometers south-southwest of Hakata-Minami Station on the Kyushu Shinkansen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNakagawa city home page(in Japanese)\nCultural Porperties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)",

Their Galactic 02 launch occurred on 10 August 2023. Anastatia, at 18, was the youngest person to have gone into space using the United States definition of the boundary of space.\n\n\n== Space travel ==\nIn 2021, the duo won tickets for the Galactic 02 launch, typically sold for $450,000, through a drawing held by Virgin Galactic. The draw, which required a minimum donation of $10, was held as part of a charity event raising funds for the non-profit organization Space For Humanity.\nSchahaff received a pledge of support by tourism minister Charles Fernandez on behalf of the nation and the Ministry of Tourism and Investment.\nThe trip, launched 10 August 2023, was the company's seventh spaceflight, second commercial space flight, and first private passenger launch.

        "content": "The Antoku Ōzuka Kofun (安徳大塚古墳)  is a Kofun period  burial mound, located in the city of  Nakagawa,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2016.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Antoku Ōzuka Kofun  is located on the tip of a west-facing hill with an elevation of about 30 meters, orientated to the west.  It is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. In 1971, the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education conducted an archaeological excavation due to the development of a nearby housing complex. As a result, it was found that the total length of the mound was 64 meters, and that the tumulus was built by cutting a moat approximately 10 meter wide from the front and rear hills. The diameter of the posterior circular part is approximately 35 meters and the height is approximately six meters. The rectangular anterior portion is approximately 30 meters long, with a width of approximately 20 meters, and height of two meters.  The slopes of both areas were covered with fukiishi, and haniwa. The tumulus had been robbed in antiquity and details of the burial chamber are uncertain. From the haniwa and pottery shards recovered at the site, together with the shape of the mound,  it is estimated that this tumulus was built around the latter half of the 4th century, or early in the Kofun period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNakagawa city home page(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Delfines Hotel & Convention Center, formerly known as the Delfines Hotel & Casino and commonly known as the Hotel Los Delfines, is a five-star hotel in San Isidro District, Lima, Peru. From its opening in 1997 until 2010, the hotel was best known for its two bottlenose dolphins, Yaku and Wayra, who gave the hotel its name.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hotel, owned by Jacques Levy Calvo—a Peruvian businessman and banker of French-Jewish descent—and his siblings, opened on July 15, 1997, intended to attract foreign businessmen visiting the city. Its name came from the two dolphins that were trained by Levy's (then) wife, María Elena Llanos. At the time of its opening, it was the first hotel able to host more than 1,000 in an event hall.\nIn 2008, the hotel's \"Salón Mediterráneo\" event hall was one of the locations where meetings of that year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation were held.\n\n\n=== Dolphins ===\n\nYaku (born c. 1988) and Wayra (born c. 1992) are two male and female bottlenose dolphins that served as the hotel's namesake and main attraction from 1997 to 2010. Born off the coasts of Cuba, they were smuggled to Mexico, where they became known as \"Yoyo\" and \"Laly\" until their arrival to Peru, where they were moved to the hotel and renamed to the Quechua words for \"water\" and \"air\", respectively.\nThe dolphins' arrival to Peru in 1997 after their purchase the year before led to an immediate response by animal welfare groups in the country, with the Judiciary of Peru ruling in favour of the hotel, concluding that the pool where they were kept was built prior to the creation of any regulations regarding the maintenance of captive dolphins. Consequently, the dolphins remained in the hotel, accessible to its guests and reportedly exposed to the show lights and street noise.\nIn 2010, both dolphins were moved from the hotel to another pool in a hill near La Herradura, a beach in Chorrillos District. The new site's poor conditions were condemned by local media, with its small size (12 m in diameter and 3.5 m deep) being highlighted. All visits ceased to be allowed in 2011.\nDuring the entirety of her captivity, Wayra became pregnant four times with ultimately no calf surviving due to the conditions they lived in. The one calf she gave birth to is alleged to have been crushed by her due to the small size of the hotel pool.\nBoth dolphins were reportedly moved to Dolphin Cove Jamaica, a dolphinarium in Jamaica, on July 18, 2014. These claims have since been disputed, however, by former caretaker Ursula Behr, who was once denied a visit to the dolphins in June 2014. María Elena Llanos, Levy's ex-wife, also denounced the lack of transparency and possible abuse in the animals' transport, highlighting that Yaku's cardiac issues could be fatal if not treated properly.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCountry Club Lima Hotel, located next to the hotel\n\n\n== References ==",

He is best remembered for a drop goal he kicked against the All Blacks at Rodney Parade in 1963. His 17th-minute drop goal was the only score of a 3–0 win, which made Newport the only side to beat the All Blacks during their 36-match tour.\nUzzell, capped five times, made his Wales debut against the 1963 All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park, two months after his famous goal. He featured in all four matches of the 1965 Five Nations Championship, as Wales claimed the triple crown.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDick Uzzell at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Tegelijk groen (Netherlands Dutch pronunciation: [təɣəˈlɛɪk ɣrun] lit. 'simultaneously green'), commonly translated as all directions green and also known as a bike scramble is a traffic rule in the Netherlands allowing bicycles to cross designated intersections at the same time from all sides. The all-cross phasing for bicycles was invented in Groningen in 1989. On the Groningen crossings where tegelijk groen was introduced, no more fatal accidents between bicycles and motorised traffic have occurred since. Cyclists must coordinate the crossing spontaneously, as no side has priority. Priority to the right does not hold, so in case of an accident, no cyclist can claim that the other took their right of way. \nThe rule is planned to be introduced on intersections in Belgium as a square green for cyclists (Dutch: vierkant groen, French: vert intégral) in autumn 2025. The rule will also be rolled out for pedestrians, i.e. as a pedestrian scramble.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIdaho stop\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll Directions Green (Tegelijk Groen) - Groningen on YouTube",

        "content": "Akhania is a genus of flowering plants in the amaranth family, Amaranthaceae. It includes three species native to the eastern Mediterranean and western and central Asia, ranging from Greece through western Asia to the Caucasus, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nAkhania includes small shrubs or subshrubs 20 to 100 cm tall. The plants have a bushy habit, with several or numerous stems, small linear or broadly lanceolate leaves which are bright green, glaucous, or grayish and 5–35 mm long by 1–3 mm wide.\nThe genus Akhania is named after the Iranian botanist Hossein Akhani. Its species were formerly placed in the genera Salsola or Caroxylon. A genetic and morphological analysis concluded that the three species formed a distinct clade which is sister to Caroxylon.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThree species are accepted:\n\nAkhania canescens (Moq.) Sukhor. – western and central Asia, from Turkey and Palestine to Afghanistan and Kazakhstan\nAkhania carpatha (P.H.Davis) Sukhor. – the Greek Islands of Crete, Karpathos, and the Cyclades\nAkhania daghestanica (Bunge) Sukhor. – endemic to Dagestan in the northeastern Caucasus.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Avelino Henrique Saíde Vieira Dias Rodrigues Mingas (13 February 1934 – 27 May 1977) was an Angolan economist, writer, soldier, and politician who was a notable figure in the anti-colonial struggle for independence in Angola. He was the first Minister of Finance of an independent Angola and one of the ten members of the first national legislature, the Revolutionary Council of the People (or the \"Council of the Revolution\"). He was also a member of the Central Committee of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). A close associate of Agostinho Neto and Lúcio Lara, he was killed by people associated with the fractionists during the 1977 Angolan coup attempt.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMingas was born in the Ingombota district of Luanda, on 13 February 1934, the son of André \"Mongone\" Rodrigues Mingas and Antónia Diniz de Aniceto Vieira Dias. Some of his siblings are also notable figures in Angolan history, such as singers and composers André Mingas and Ruy Mingas, the latter of whom wrote the Angolan national anthem; linguist and investigator Amélia Mingas; athlete and administrator Júlia Rodrigues Mingas; and police captain José \"Zé\" Rodrigues Mingas. His family has also had a very strong connection to Angolan nationalism, primarily through his father, André Mongone, founder and one of the leaders of the African National League, and through his uncle, Liceu Vieira Dias, a pioneer of Angolan pop music and a founding member of the MPLA.\nAs a member of an upper-class African family in Luanda, he was able to receive extensive schooling, concluding his studies at the Instituto Médio Industrial de Luanda. However, he soon began involving himself with the anti-colonial struggle, mainly using literature as his form of political expression.\nHe became a militant in the nationalist movements, influenced by his uncle. However, as a result of both his uncle and his father being arrested in the beginning of the 1960s, he moved to Portugal for his studies. There, he came to be known as an excellent athlete and sportsman. While playing for a local sports team, he was warned that he would be arrested. He was able to outsmart the Portuguese police under the pretext of participating in a sports competition in Spain, and subsequently fled to Paris. He took refuge with Mário Pinto de Andrade, owing to his formal affiliation with the MPLA.\nHe remained serving in various European offices of the MPLA during a certain period until he was able to receive a scholarship to continue his studies in Cuba. While in Cuba, he graduated as an economist at the Instituto de Planificación Física and earned a doctorate degree in economics from the University of Havana. He also received military training with a specialization in martial arts. His time in Cuba transformed him, along with being a nationalist, into a Marxist.\nHe returned to the party headquarters in Brazzaville in 1971, during the Angolan War of Independence. He obtained the rank of major, and became a member of and fighting with the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (EPLA) under the pseudonym Lutuima. He was named the Director of the Center of Revolutionary Instruction of the Eastern Front, a position he occupied until 1972, including a time when in which he assumed leadership of the “Movement of Readjustment of the Eastern Front”. In 1972, he was transferred to the Department of Foreign Relations, being also invited to work in the party's regional offices in Lusaka. While there, he officially made his codename, Saíde, his legal name.\nAfter his roles on the Eastern Front and in Lusaka, he rose quickly to leadership positions in the MPLA, going on to become a part of the inner circles of Neto and Lara, mainly during the Active Revolt in Brazzaville. He was invited by Neto to serve as the chief of the MPLA office in Stockholm, Sweden, in the European country that most strongly supported the MPLA outside of those in the Socialist Bloc. He makes mention of his time in Cuba and Sweden in his poems, publishing them in a collection for the first time in Stockholm. He adopted the literary pseudonym \"Gasmin Rodrigues\". He was proven to be a formidable polyglot, having learned, along with Portuguese, Spanish, English, Swedish, Russian, and French.\nIn the middle of the Carnation Revolution and the expectations of the decolonization of Angola, he was invited by Neto in July 1974 to serve in as a party representative at the Organisation of African Unity to discuss and attempt one last solution to split the Active Revolt and the Eastern Revolt. Frustrated and obliged to, he received permission with other commanders to reformulate the EPLA and transformed it into the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA).\nOn 8 November 1974 he lodged with the “delegation of 26” of the party, led by secretary-general Lara. His participation contributed to his rapid ascension into leadership positions in the MPLA, including being elected to the Central Committee of the Movement. In January 1975, at the Alvor Agreement, he organized the Presidential Council on the Transition of Government as the minister of Planning and Finances.\nThe functions of the transitional governments cabinet were suspended in August 1975, with Mingas returning to combat as a major in FAPLA, being on the front lines to capture Luanda. The MPLA forces were victorious with guaranteed control of the capital. Even while in armed combat, he took part in, as a request of Manuel Rui, the writing of a constitutional document as a coordinator, writing the main economic tenets of the Angolan Constitution of 1975.\nWith the proclamation of Angolan independence on 11 November 1975, he took office as part of the aforementioned Revolutionary Council, along with heading the Directory of Agriculture and Accounting Services. He reformed the directory and, in March 1976, became the first Minister of Finance of the new country. In terms of financial and economic policy, he established a period of especially cautious transition against enormous financial difficulties for the country, attempting to contain increasing public debt, maintaining balance and  budgetary losses, and creating institutional financial stability.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBy 1976, there began to be a secretly formed opposition group within the MPLA called the Fractionists (or the nitistas), that had promoted inflammatory rhetoric against the “white-mestiço elite”, as well as against socioeconomic policies that they had attributed to the continuing widespread and deeply embedded poverty in Angola. This came after the war for independence but right as the civil war began to take form. The latter point made Mingas, a moderate within the movement, a personal adversary of the nitistas.\nOn their side, during a meeting with the Central Committee of the MPLA in February 1977, Mingas was one of those who accused the nitistas of “fractionalism”. Along with this, on 21 May 1977, he became aware of documents relating to the expulsion of Nito Alves and José Jacinto Van-Dúnem from the party. At the same time, his youngest brother, Zé Mingas, a police commander in the Directory of Information and Security of Angola (DISA), had become a supporter of the nitistas and informed Alves of plans to dismantle the coup attempt against the state.\nOn 27 May 1977, the nitistas attempted to overthrow the state. Various national leaders were taken hostage, among them Mingas, who had driven to meet with Neto and lead a group to attempt to retake the 9th Brigade headquarters and take control of the mutinous troops. Mingas was captured by the nitistas from DISA and was taken, along with Eugénio Nzaji and other military personnel against the revolt, to Sambizanga, where they were later burned alive. Zé Mingas was not aware of the plans of the nitistas to kidnap and kill his own brother, and himself was ultimately killed during the violent repression by the state against the coup attempt.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMingas is remembered as one of the greatest national heroes of Angola. His name is given to a plaza in Luanda, near the National Bank of Angola building, as well as various governmental institutions. There are many other monuments and public places spread throughout the country.\nIn 2019, president of Angola João Lourenço ordered the revision of the official history of the events of the 1977 coup attempt inside the “Reconciliation Plan in Memory of Victims of Armed Conflict in Angola”. Mingas’ daughter, lawyer Xissole Madeira Vieira Dias Mingas, received, in June 2021, her father's official death certificate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Big Baby Scam is the 9th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 12 December 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are once again homeless and starving. Upon seeing two babies in a crib, Ren tells Stimpy that the life of a baby is a pampered one. He devises a scheme where he will bribe the two infants to leave and that he and Stimpy will take their places. He contacts the two twin brothers, Shawn and Eugene, who are portrayed as being like gangsters who agree to leave in exchange for $50. Ren and Stimpy take the place of Shawn and Eugene. The parents of the two boys, the perpetually clueless couple Mr. and Mrs. Pipe, are apparently incapable of noticing that their sons have been replaced by a dog and cat. Ren discovers that the life of a baby is not what he expected and is subjected to various humiliations at the hands of the Pipes. A policeman brings back Shawn and Eugene Pipe and exposes the scam. Ren asks for the return of his \"50\" and receives it when the two brothers give him 50 punches.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMrs. Pipe-voice of Cheryl Chase \nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\nShawn Pipe-voice of Harris Peet\nThe policeman-voice of Billy West\nEugene Pipe-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was directed by Vincent Waller who drew the episode largely by himself. Production on Big Baby Scam was so troubled and over-budget that the lay-out stage of production was normally done at the Spümcø studio in Los Angeles was assigned to the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul as a cost-saving measure. Waller went to South Korea to supervise the lay-out work and had the task completed in three weeks. The episode was heavily censored by the Nickelodeon which removed the scene of the nude \"family bath\" where Ren stares intendedly at the breasts of Mrs. Pipe along with the scene where Mr. Pipe rubs Ren across his facial stubble.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe British critic Becky Barnicoat wrote that The Ren & Stimpy Show was \"confounding\" when it first aired in the United Kingdom in 1994 on the BBC, writing it featured a level of violence and vulgarity not seen in any cartoon aired on British television before. Barnicoat used the nude \"family bath\" scene in Big Baby Scam (which was not censored in the United Kingdom) as an example of how revolutionary The Ren & Stimpy Show was as there had never been a cartoon with scenes such as that aired before.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 30–100 mm (1.2–3.9 in) long with 3 to 17 narrowly elliptic leaflets, the side leaflets 5–20 mm (0.20–0.79 in) long and 3–10 mm (0.12–0.39 in) wide with stipules 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, sometimes yellow, 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long, arranged in racemes of 5 to 15, 10–80 mm (0.39–3.15 in) long, on a peduncle 0.5–1.5 mm (0.020–0.059 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long, with lobes equal to or longer than the tube. The standard petal is 6–9 mm (0.24–0.35 in) long and 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide, the wings 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long and the keel 5–8.5 mm (0.20–0.33 in) long and about 2 mm (0.079 in) deep.

        "content": "Mad Dog Höek is the 8th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 21 November 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a parody of professional wrestling, Ren and Stimpy have joined a WWF-like professional wrestling promotion under the stage names of Mad Dog Höek and Killer Kadoogan. Stimpy expresses concern that he might be hurt, but Ren reassures them that professional wresting is fake and that no one will be harmed. The opponents of Ren and Stimpy are the well named Lout brothers, Lump and Loaf. In the tag-team wresting match, the Lout brothers dominate the match and inflict much pain on Ren and Stimpy. Ren fights back, but is overwhelmed while Stimpy takes a masochistic pleasure in being beaten up. It is revealed that the outcome of the match has been decided in advance by the promoters and at the appointed time the Lout brothers lose in an unlikely manner despite the way that they have dominated the match. At the end of the match, the Lout brothers vow revenge for their defeat while Stimpy gives a deranged rant about how he and someone named Darrin really like the Lout brothers.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nLump Lout-voice of Bob Camp\nThe Announcer-voice of Billy West\nLoaf Lout-voice of Bob Camp\n\n\n== Production ==\nFor the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show, production of the episodes was divided into an \"A\" unit headed by the showrunner, John Kricfalusi which were more prestigious and a \"B\" unit headed by Bob Camp, which were not. Mad Dog Höek was one of the \"B\" productions assigned to Camp. The \"A\" productions headed by Kricfalusi had more time and money devoted to them while Kricfalusi later stated that \"corners were cut\" on the \"B\" productions which were seen by him just as a way of fulfilling the quota of episodes ordered by the Nickelodeon network. Camp decided the cartoonist world of professional wrestling with its over-the-top storylines and caricatured characters would make for a good subject for a cartoon. Production moved forward swiftly on the \"B\" productions as Camp was less of a perfectionist than Kircfalusi. Camp described himself as beign \"more about the gag\" as the episodes directed by him tended to be light on plot and were instead just merely a collection of gags centered around a single theme, in this case professional wrestling. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski in a review gave Mad Dog Höek three and a half stars out of five stars, writing it was an amusing parody of the already cartoonist and silly world of professional wresting with Stimpy giving a \"completly deranged fit\" at the end.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "content": "Marjory Joyce Fitzpatrick  (née Cawte, 15 July 1922 – 21 January 2018) was an Australian education advocate, author and a flight sergeant with the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force.Fitzpatrick is credited with helping institute reforms in South Australia which enabled parents to have more input in how their children's schools were managed.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFitzpatrick was born in Torrensville in the western suburbs of Adelaide, her father being a school headmaster. During her childhood, Fitzpatrick's family moved around South Australia living in such places as Streaky Bay, Waikerie, Solomontown and Plympton.She attended Adelaide High School but left early to pursue employment as a secretary.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nIn 1941, following the outbreak of the second world war, Fitzpatrick joined the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and relocated to Melbourne initially to assist with the shortage of male telegraphists.However, she rose to the rank of flight sergeant with the Z Force unit.\n\n\n== Education reforms ==\nFitzpatrick married Ron Fitzpatrick, a Rat of Tobruk who she had met at a Melbourne railway station in 1942.With her husband becoming a school headmaster, the couple moved around South Australia and lived in various communities such as Whyalla, Coonalbyn, Bowman, Moorak, Port Augusta and Morphett Vale.Fitzpatrick began lobbying for parents to have a stronger role within the schools their children attended, and ultimately became the president of the South Australian Association of School Parents Communities. In 1975, Fitzpatrick was one of the delegates who spoke at a rally of the Southern Eyre Peninsula Schools Welfare Association where she argued for a new scheme to assist high school students who were required to leave the local area for the final two years of secondary education.Fitzpatrick is credited with instituting sweeping reforms in the 1980s which enabled parents to have a better say in how their children's school were being managed. She was frequently invited to speak at education seminars and conduct workshops for parents.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nFitzpatrick had a great interest in writing and in 1987 wrote a biography recounting the life of Edith Strangway which was published in The Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal.In 1997 she helped establish a writer's group in Goolwa called \"Sand Writers\" where she wrote numerous short stories and poems which were published by the group.In 2007, Fitzpatrick and her husband invited eight World War II veterans to come together and share their wartime stories which were published in a book, The Stories of Us.Her husband Ron Fitzpatrick died at the age of 94 in 2013.Joyce Fitzpatrick died in Adelaide on 21 January 2018.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn the 1988 Australia Day Honours, Fitzpatrick was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for her service to education.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Volodymyr Semenovych Boyko (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Семе́нович Бо́йко; 20 August 1938 – 10 June 2015) was a Ukrainian metallurgist, entrepreneur and politician who is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Merit. Additionally, he was a member of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada from 2002 to 2007 and 2012 to 2014.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 20 August 1938, in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Sadki was the place where Boyko was raised. Tatiana Vladimirovna, his future daughter, was born in a home that his parents had constructed. Boyko stated that his first ambition was to become a sailor. He applied to the maritime school and was enrolled in the Soviet Navy in 1953, having completed seven classes at the No. 44 school. He later received his diploma from the Mariupol Metallurgical Institute in 1970. \n\n\n== Career ==\nBoyko was first employed as a pipeline worker in the Zhdanov Metallurgical Plant's water supply shop from 1955 to 1960. This plant was eventually renamed the Illich Steel and Iron Works of Mariupol. Following that, he worked on the fishing trawler RT-142 trawlflot in the fleet Glavmurmanrybprom and as a plumbing technician in the Stalinshakhtostroy building unit. During this time from 1957 to 1960, he also served in the ranks of the Soviet Armed Forces. He was conscripted into the Soviet Army, and was stationed in the Leningrad Military District. In 1960, he was demobilized as a junior sergeant and team leader. \nBoyko went from working as a cold metal carving in 1960 to being a supervisor at the metal rolling business in 1971. Later, he rose to the rank of senior master in the same business. After that, he worked as the special production department's deputy director for manufacturing and administration before taking over as head of the sheet rolling business. He served as the company's deputy head and acting head of the Production and Administrative Department from 1983 until 1990. After that, he was named deputy director of the plant for production and supply of products and took over as head of the Production and Administrative Department.\nBoyko was the general director of Illich Steel and Iron Works from 1990 until 1997. He became the general director and chairman of the board of the company after it was corporatized in 1997. Furthermore, he served as a freelance advisor to President Leonid Kravchuk from 1993 to 1994. He took the helm while both the nation and its economy suffered a collapse. He not only prevented the company from going bankrupt, but also elevated it to the top of the national metallurgical landscape.\nBetween 1994 and 2002, Boyko held a seat as a deputy of the Donetsk Oblast Council for two terms, while concurrently participating in the Council of Exporters under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Coordinating Council on Internal Policy. In 1994, he backed Leonid Kuchma as a representative of the Red Directorate in the presidential race. According to Vladimir Semyonov, he never pursued a career in politics. However, President Kuchma persuaded him to visit the legislature. From 2002 to 2007, he served as a People's Deputy of Ukraine, initially representing the bloc For United Ukraine! and later the Socialist Party, contributing notably to committees focused on industrial and regulatory policy within the Verkhovna Rada.\nBoyko's political allegiances changed as time passed. He had been a member of many groups, such as United Ukraine and European Choice, before temporarily joining the Party of Regions in November 2003 and staying there until September 2005. Subsequently, he forged partnerships with lawmakers from the Socialist Party, ultimately emerging as a key supporter of the party. From 2006 to 2007, he served as the Socialist Party's People's Deputy of Ukraine for the 5th convocation and made contributions to the committee on Industrial and Regulatory Policy and Entrepreneurship.\nAfter an extended sickness, Boyko passes away on 10 June 2015, at his old age of 76. Boyko's farewell for Mariupol locals took place in the Karl Marx Palace of Culture on Friday, 12 June from 9:00 to 14:00.\n\n\n== Philantrophy ==\nCitizens in Ukraine received no wages as companies closed one before another; the Illich Steel and Iron Works saw success back then, Boyko provided employment for many Mariupol locals. In addition, he funded football clubs and water their pitches, boxing matches and football fields, and he rebuilt educational institutions, preschools, healthcare facilities, police departments, tribunals, and the attorney's office. He also funded parks, highways, and airports.\nBoyko mentored the football team Metalurh (now FC Mariupol) in the late 1990s, and the team set a lofty objective for itself: to join the Ukrainian Premier League. His efforts paid off, as the squad was given access to one of the greatest seaside training bases in Ukraine at the time. The city got the biggest indoor sporting facility in Ukraine in 2001. The Western stadium, where the Ukraine women's national football team played in the successful Euro 2009, was constructed. The Illichivets Stadium (now Volodymyr Boyko Stadium), which hosted UEFA Cup matches, was reconstructed.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBoyko was married to Claudia Alexandrovna, and together they have a daughter, Tatiana Vladimirovna Potapova. He and his family resided in an unusually simple house.\nBoyko has an honorary sixth place on the list of 130 richest Ukrainians with a fortune of $3.15 billion, according to Fokus magazine's evaluation, which was published in March 2008. Furthermore, as the article points out, he could brag of only $1.3 billion in the start of 2007.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nBoyko received the gold medal from the WIPO Academy in 2006 in recognition of his exceptional contribution to the growth of creative endeavors in Ukraine. He ranked 45th on the Top 100 list of the most powerful individuals in Ukraine published in 2006 by the magazine De Correspondent, and he held the 61st position of the 200 most influential Ukrainians listing in the 2007 Fokus magazine assessment. The state bestowed upon him the most prestigious title, that of Hero of Ukraine, for his achievements, becoming the first and only awardee from Mariupol. A commemorative Bronze bust honoring him was unveiled on the exterior of the Pryazovskyi State Technical University's first building in Mariupol on 21 October 2017. \nHe has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (18 July 2003)\n Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Fifth Class (24 August 2013)\n Order of Merit First Class (27 April 2001)\n Order of Merit Second Class (19 September 1998)\n Order of Merit Third Class (7 February 1997)\n Order of Danylo Halytsky (19 August 2006)\n Order of the Badge of Honour (1974)\nHonored Metallurgist of Ukraine (17 July 1995)\nState Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology (1 December 1999)\nNamed for Volodymyr Boyko Stadium (2018)\nHonorary President of the FC Mariupol\nHonorary Citizen of Mariupol (1998)\nHonorary Citizen of the Krasnohvardiiske Raion\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Instead, the Brisbane Civic Party was formed and led by Mitchelton Ward councillor John Andrews.Despite changes introduced by the Bjelke-Petersen state government before the 1973 election, which reduced the number of wards and removed the direct lord mayoral election, the BCP lost in a landslide. The Labor Party won 20 out of 21 seats, while the BCP won just one ward − Indooroopilly − while Andrews lost his seat in Mitchelton.Following the BCP's loss, the Liberal Party decided to endorse candidates, starting at the 1976 election. The CMO also disbanded around this time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCitizens' Municipal Organisation\nLiberal Civic Party\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ōzuka Kofun (王塚古墳)  is a Kofun period decorated kofun burial mounds, located in the Jumei neighborhood of the town of  Keisen,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1937, and elevated in status to that of a Special National Historic Site in 1956  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Ōzuka Kofun was discovered by chance on September 30, 1934, when the front part of the stone burial chamber was scraped away during construction work. The shape of the tumulus is that of a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above; however, more than half of the mound has been lost due to previous construction work. The original length is estimated to have been 86 meters, with a posterior circular portion diameter of 56 meters and height of 9.5 meters, and an anterior rectangular portion width of 60 meters. The tumulus was constructed in two tiers, with alternating layers of red and black clay, covered by fukiishi. It was surrounded by a double moat.\nThe burial chamber is a horizontal entry stone chamber, with a stone shelf at the top of the back wall and a small window above the entrance.  It has a house-shaped cap stone that covers the sarcophagus, and the floor is divided into areas for two burials, with two depressions are made to place the heads, and two stone pillows. However, it is estimated that four people were buried here. Currently, the burial chamber is completely sealed for preservation, although it open to the public twice a year, in spring and fall. It is noteworthy in that mural painting that covers almost the entire surface of the burial chamber. The images depicted include horses, shields, swords, bows, and geometric patterns such as concentric ring patterns, warabi patterns, triangular patterns, and circular patterns. Six colors (red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white) have been confirmed in decorated kofun around Japan, and this tumulus uses five of these six colors (except for blue). This is the highest number of colors for any known tomb in Japan.\nWhen excavated, the burial chamber was found to be intact, and thus a large number of grave goods were recovered. These include a bronze mirror, a lapis lazuli tubular bead, two wooden beads with metal inlay, nine earthen beads, one amber bead, one gold item, metal fittings for horse harnesses, saddles and stirrups, and iron swords, arrowheads and a large quantity of Sue ware pottery. \nThe excavated artifacts were designated as a National Important Cultural Property in 1956 and are stored at the Kyoto National Museum.\nThe tumulus is a six-minute walk (480 meters) from Keisen Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuho Main Line.The Ōzuka Decorated Kofun Museum (王塚装飾古墳館) on site has displays of the murals in the burial chamber.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ozuka-kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOzuka Kofun Museum home page(in Japanese)\nKeisen Town home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Funabaru Kofun (船原古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Taniyama neighborhood of the city of Koga,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2016.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Funabaru Kofun was discovered in 1995 during land reclamation for farmland improvement. It is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above, and is estimated to have been constructed between the end of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century. The existing length is 37.4 meters, and the restored total length is estimated to be over 45 meters. It was excavated from 2012 to 2013. The burial chamber was a horizontal-entry stone chamber made of monoliths, with an anterior and posterior room.  The site is noteworthy for its wealth of grave goods, which were unusually buried in pits outside the main tumulus. The No. 1 earthen pit, which has an inverted L-shape, contained over 500 items. These included the first chandelier-shaped gilt-bronze horse harness decorations found in Japan, including a cross-piece fitting with a green glass bead set in the center, and metal weapons, armor and agricultural tools. The luxury of the harness was comparable to the quality of the artifacts excavated from the Fujinoki Kofun in Nara Prefecture.  After the excavation was completed, both the burial chamber was backfilled. In April 2018, a plaza and parking lot were built adjacent to the tumulus, and it is possible to visit the exterior.\nThe tumulus is approximately 4.7 kilometres southeast of Koga Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line (12 minutes by car).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nKoga city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The 1973 Brisbane City Council election was held on 31 March 1973 to elect 21 aldermen to the City of Brisbane. The election was held as part of the statewide local government elections in Queensland, Australia.\nThe Labor Party defeated the Brisbane Civic Party (BCP) in a landslide victory, winning 20 out of 21 wards. This was despite changes introduced by the Bjelke-Petersen state government before the election, which reduced the number of wards and removed the direct lord mayoral election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to the election, the Country Party state government reduced the number of wards from 28 to 21, and removed the direct election for lord mayor. This meant incumbent Clem Jones had to contest a ward, and the lord mayor was elected by a vote of aldermen after the election. The changes were aimed at Labor, who had controlled the mayoralty since 1961.\nAfter another defeat in 1970, the Citizens' Municipal Organisation (CMO) was described as \"moribund\" and did not contest the election. Instead, the Brisbane Civic Party was formed and led by Mitchelton Ward councillor John Andrews.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe BCP won just one ward − Indooroopilly − while Andrews lost his seat in Mitchelton.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the BCP's loss, the Liberal Party decided to endorse candidates, starting at the 1976 election. The CMO disbanded around this time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Yakenotōge Kofun (焼ノ峠古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Shisojima neighborhood of the town of  Chikuzen,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1975.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Yakenotōge Kofun is located is located on a ridge extending north from Shiroyama, a small, independent hill in the northwestern part of the Chikugo Plain. It is a \"two conjoined rectangles\" style (zenpō-kōhō-fun (前方後方墳) tumulus, which is extremely rare for Kyushu. It is orientated to the south-south east, and has a total length of  approximately 40.5 meters. The posterior portion is 23.5 meters on each side, and approximately 4.5 meters in height.The anterior part is 17 meters long, 12 meters wide, and approximately two meters high, and the width at the waist is 8.5 meters. The tumulus is surrounded by a moat about two meters wide. The posterior portion is thought to have been constructed in two stages, with the second stage being a mound of earth on top of the first stage, which was carved out of the ground. The anterior portion was entirely carved out of the ground. A vertical burial chamber was confirmed in the center of the posterior portion; however, a complete archaeological excavation has not been performed.\nAn ancient-style double-rimmed jar and a wide-mouthed jar was found near the surrounding moat. Judging from these Haji ware pottery shards, the tumulus is believed to date to the early Kofun period. The tumulus is approximately 20 minutes by car from Tsuko Station on the Nishitetsu Tenjin Ōmuta Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTown Board of Education home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "\"So Crazy\" is a song by Japanese singer Namie Amuro. It was released on October 16, 2003, by Avex Trax, and serves as the fourth and final single from her sixth studio album, Style (2003). Furthermore, all physical and digital formats included an additional A-side titled \"Come,\" which appears on the parent album. \"So Crazy\" was written by Full Force, Jennifer \"JJ\" Johnson, Michico, and Tiger, and produced by Cobra Endo. \n\"So Crazy\" is a love song that incorporates elements of hip-hop and R&B music. Music critics praised \"So Crazy\" for its urban sound, drawing parallels with Western music and influences. To promote the song, Japanese cosmetics company Lucido-L used it as their commercial theme. However, the single performed moderately in Japan, reaching number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, making it one of her lowest charting singles in the country.\nMasashi Mutō directed the music video for the single, which appeared on her video albums Filmography 2001–2005 (2005). It was also included in the set lists of three Amuro concerts and subsequent live albums. \"So Crazy\" first appeared on Amuro's third greatest hits album, Best Fiction (2008), and was later reworked and re-recorded for her seventh greatest hits and final album, Finally (2017), before her retirement.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Amuro worked on new music with the Japanese project Suite Chic. Her work with them inspired her to invite more collaborators to showcase various aspects of herself through her music. She began working on new music, collaborating with artists such as Zeebra, Ai, and Verbal, among others. During the process, \"So Crazy\" was one of several demo recordings recommended to her and her team. Amuro said she enjoyed the demo and imagined herself performing the song, saying \"I got an image of how it would be right away. I could imagine myself on stage, made up and in costume, singing and dancing to it.\"\n\"So Crazy\" was written by Full Force and Jennifer \"JJ\" Johnson, with Japanese lyrics by Michico and a rap section written by Tiger. Amuro stated that she wanted to rap on the song, which Zeebra and Tiger encouraged her to do, with the latter suggesting she showcase her \"naughty\" side. Toshihiro Wako assisted with the recording at Tokyo's On Air Azabu Studios. Rob Chiarelli and Chandler Bridges mixed the final version, and Yasuji Maeda mastered it. \"So Crazy\" is a love song that incorporates elements of hip-hop and R&B music.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn October 13, 2003, Avex Trax released \"So Crazy\" as a double A-side with \"Come\" as the third single from Amuro's sixth studio album Style (2003). The CD format included three additional tracks, including instrumental versions of the singles. The single was eventually distributed in Hong Kong in November of that year. The song was used as the commercial theme for the Japanese cosmetics company Lucido-L.\nMasashi Mutō directed a music video featuring Amuro and dancers in an underground parking scene, choreographed by Warner. The choreography took about ten days to complete, while the music video was finished in one session. The video was later featured on her video album Filmography 2001–2005 (2005). \"So Crazy\" was later included on Amuro's setlists for three different tours: the So Crazy Tour, the Space of Hip-Pop Tour, and the Best Fiction Tour. \"So Crazy\" and its music video appeared on Amuro's third greatest hits album, Best Fiction (2008), while the song was reworked and re-recorded for her seventh greatest hits and final album, Finally (2017), prior to her retirement.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMusic critics gave \"So Crazy\" positive reviews. AllMusic cited the song as a standout from Amuro's discography. Japanese magazine CDJournal reviewed the single and its appearances on Style and Best Fiction. CDJournal praised the single's release for attempting to capture Western music influences, while its appearance on Style was praised for its hip-hop sound and Michico's contributions to the song. For Best Fiction, the song was praised for its lyrics, alongside its chorus and rap section.\nCommercially, it performed moderately in Japan. \"So Crazy\" and \"Come\" debuted at number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 18,868 units in its first week. It became Amuro's lowest performing single at the time, alongside \"Shine More\", until it was surpassed by the follow-up single \"Alarm\", which peaked at number 11. The single spent 13 weeks on the chart, and has sold 48,969 units since its release, one of Amuro's poorest performance in the region.\n\n\n== Formats and track listing ==\nCD / digital / streaming formats\n\n\"So Crazy\" – 4:33\n\"Come\" – 4:35\n\"So Crazy\" (Instrumental) – 4:33\n\"Come\" (Instrumental) – 4:35\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Style.\nLocations\n\nRecorded at On Air Azabu Studios in Tokyo.\nPersonnel\n\nNamie Amuro – vocals\nCobra Endo – arranger, producer, programmer, production manager, coordinator\nMichico – songwriter\nTiger – songwriter\nRob Chiarelli – audio mixer\nChandler Bridges – audio mixing assistant\nFull Force – composer, songwriter\nJennifer \"JJ\" Johnson – composer, songwriter\nRon Harris – programmer\nDaisuke Imai – vocal director\nYasuji Maeda – audio master\nToshihiro Wako – recording assistant\n\n\n== Weekly charts ==\n\n\n== Sales ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"So Crazy\"/\"Come\" on Namie Amuro's official website (archived).\n\"So Crazy\" on Spotify.\n\"So Crazy\" (Finally version) on Spotify.",

        "content": "Dakota Adams (born 1996–1997) is an American from Montana who is running as a Democrat for the Montana House of Representatives in District 1 in northern Lincoln County in the 2024 United States elections. Adams is the oldest son of Oath Keeper Stewart Rhodes, who is currently serving an 18-year prison term for seditious conspiracy. Adams was homeschooled and raised with extreme Right-wing, prepper conspiracy theories. He left the American militia movement over his teenage years and wrote about his reasoning for Raw Story in 2022.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe oldest son of six children of Stewart Rhodes and Tasha Adams, Dakota Adams was homeschooled and purposely kept uneducated for his father to hold power over the household, keeping the threat of child protective services breaking up the family if they were to discover the children were not being educated by the state's laws. As a child he answered emails for the Oath Keepers and trained for the apocalypse. After leaving the militia world, Adams began to catch up on the education he was lacking, one area he had to learn was the multiplication table. He eventually passed a high-school equivalency exam.\nAccording to an interview with Laura Coates for CNN Adams described his upbringing as being in an \"extreme bubble of fear and isolation and paranoid ideology starting well before the founding of the Oath Keepers\". He stated that Rhodes was a \"pure authoritarian that was very much reflected at home\". The family managed to get away from Rhodes in 2018.\nHe plans to sell the militia paraphernalia he used to wear to \"anti-government protests alongside his father\".\n\n\n== 2024 political run ==\nCalling himself a \"progressive Democrat\" and an \"honest weirdo\" Adams believes that the residents of Montana deserve to have a choice of candidates. In 2022 he noticed that the ballot was mostly Republicans running unopposed. Stating that he wants to show that \"more ordinary people\" can step up and run for office. When asked in an interview why he was running he stated that he needs to \"walk the walk\" and stop \"yelling at other people to do something\". He believes that the Republican Party in Montana have \"failed the people in the state with a disastrous legislative session of mismanagement, performative virtue signaling, culture war issues over and over. ... Real problems and utter disregard for the welfare of the people of this state\".\nAdams opposes gun control laws saying that laws will harm disadvantaged groups from owning guns, though he advocates for a rehabilitation of gun culture calling it \"vanity-based, hyper-individualist ego trip culture\". He will be running against Neil Duram, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who was elected unopposed in 2018. Adams uses his mother's maiden name instead of Rhodes, and \"campaigns wearing band t-shirts and wearing black nail polish\", refusing to conform to the standard dress codes of politicians. The Montana Democrats \"are happy to have Adams on the ballot as Democrats have been hesitant to run in the deeply red district\".\nHe plans on running on \"core practical concerns such as housing costs, rising property taxes, inflation and abortion rights\". Adams says that Montana needs to have a plan to deal with rising real estate costs and sprawl.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In New Zealand politics, the phrase \"coalition of chaos\" was widely used during the 2023 New Zealand general election campaign. The phrase was a pejorative term used by the leaders of both major political parties - Chris Hipkins of the New Zealand Labour Party and Christopher Luxon the New Zealand National Party - to describe the prospective political coalitions that their respective leaders might have formed after the election. The term was chiefly used by Luxon to describe a potential left-wing coalition between Labour and the major progressive third parties, Te Pāti Māori and the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, and also to describe the resulting right-wing government Luxon formed with the ACT and New Zealand First parties upon National emerging as the largest party in the election.\n\nThe term \"coalition of chaos\" and others related to it, such as the \"three-headed taniwha\" have since been used by the opposition and some media commentators to describe the triumvirate-like power-sharing agreement that Luxon signed with Winston Peters and David Seymour, leaders of New Zealand First and ACT respectively.\n\n\n== Background and usage ==\nThe term was not coined in New Zealand, however; earlier usage included that of British Prime Minister David Cameron to describe a potential coalition between Labour and the Scottish National Party (see Chaos with Ed Miliband), which became similarly infamous.\nUnder New Zealand's mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, legislative coalitions are almost always essential for forming governments. During the campaign, Luxon, a centre-right social conservative, claimed Hipkins would form a \"coalition of chaos\" with the Green Party and Te Pāti Māori, the two other left-wing parties in the House of Representatives, the latter of whom he described as \"separatist\" and \"radical\". Luxon became known for his usage of the term. At one point Luxon caused controversy after also claiming Labour would go into coalition with \"Te Pāti Māori... and the gangs\". With the exception of former Green Party co-leader James Shaw (who has since resigned), all the leaders of New Zealand's major third parties are Māori. This is relevant because the potential left-wing coalition was seen as one which would enhance indigenous rights (in eyes of the right, to the detriment of others), and the right-wing coalition as one seen as regressive towards them.\nHipkins occasionally also utilised the phrase to claim that Luxon would form an extreme right coalition with two parties, ACT New Zealand, led by David Seymour, and New Zealand First, led by veteran politician Winston Peters; Hipkins also used the term \"coalition of cuts\". Luxon's reversal on forming a coalition with New Zealand First - which he had previously refused to comment on - was justified by Luxon himself as averting Labour's \"coalition of chaos\".\nAfter National emerged as the largest party in the election and formed such a coalition with New Zealand First and ACT, opposition politicians used the term to describe Luxon's government, the Sixth National Government of New Zealand, instead. The term \"coalition of chaos\" and others related to it, such as the \"three-headed taniwha\", have since been used to describe the triumvirate-like power-sharing agreement between Luxon, Peters and Seymour, in which Luxon had made significant concessions in exchange for support. This included the potential of a referendum on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi as proposed by ACT, which is extremely controversial. The term \"coalition of chaos\" to describe the Sixth National Government is mostly by left-wing commentators and politicians, but also some conservative ones, such as Matthew Hooton. Other commentators to have used the term include Joel Maxwell, Grant Duncan, and Rahui Papa.\n\n\n== References ==",

The weapon was designed as a cost effective weapon for allied nations who do not have high grade weapons production industry and facilities. SACO Defence halted its production during the 1990s on the grounds of a legal dispute when a copyright problem arouse with the Brazilian firearms manufacturer PLANEV (\"Mekanika Industria e Comercio\"), when they found out the SACO Model 683 was an unlicensed copy of their Uru submachine gun.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe SACO Model 683 is simple blowback operation fired from an open bolt capable of select fire. It is designed to be an easy to handle weapon for the soldier to use, made from steel stampings to reduce the cost of manufacture. The weapon is different from the URU externally: It uses an inline telescoping stock for increased accuracy which slides over the top of the receiver, a dual-function carry handle/tunnel sight for CQB, pistol grip, barrel shroud and compensator.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of submachine guns\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Altica cirsicola is a species of flea beetle from the Altica genus, which belongs to the Chrysomelidae family (commonly known as leaf beetles). A. cirsicola is found throughout East Asia. Adults feed exclusively on plants from the Cirsium genus. This food resource provides the species with the opportunity to create holes in the leaves of the plant, which helps to provide the beetles with camouflage and protection from predators.\nBoth male and female A. cirsicola make multiple matings throughout their lives. A. cirsicola males have been discovered to exhibit mate choice, using cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as one of several signals to help them identify potential mates.\nA. cirsicola have the ability to jump extensive distances, which provides them with a method of escaping predators. The jumping mechanism of A. cirsicola and other flea beetles has been described to be extremely efficient, and several studies have been conducted to analyze this jumping ability. The jumping mechanism of A. cirsicola and other flea beetles has led to a proposed design for a robotic bionic leg that can jump.\nA. cirsicola have microbial communities contained within their gut. This microbiome has been compared to microbiomes of other sympatric Altica species, and it is believed that the presence of such bacterial communities may provide several benefits to the beetles.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nAlthough beetles of the genus Altica are widely distributed throughout the world, A. cirsicola is primarily distributed throughout East Asia. The species is native to the countries of Japan and China. More recent reports have also found the species in other regions, with a 2024 publication reporting the first documented presence of the species in Russia. A. cirsicola also has had a reported presence in both North and South Korea, and there is a particular recording of the species in Mt. Hallasan National Park. Although A. cirsicola is nearly identical morphologically to the Altica carduorum species, A. carduorum is instead native to Europe.\n\n\n== Food resources ==\nLike many other leaf beetle species, A. cirsicola is an herbivore that feeds on the leaves of plants. A. cirsicola only eats plants that are from the Cirsium genus. In particular, the species is known to feed on Cirsium setosum.\nWhen A. cirsicola feeds on C. setosum, the beetle makes specialized holes in the leaves of the plant. The holes that are created in the plant are typically about half of the size of the insect's body and are usually uniform. One study by Ren et al. (2018) found that the anatomy of A. cirsicola, particularly the volume of its foregut and the restricted range of motion in the head-prothorax region, limit the size of the hole that the beetle creates while feeding. The same study also determined that the presence of these holes make it more difficult to visually recognize the beetles. These findings suggest that the holes A. cirsicola makes in its food resources serve as a form of camouflage.\n\n\n== Life history ==\nThe development goes through a metamorphosis process.\n\n\n=== Eggs ===\nThe eggs are oval and have a length about 1 to 2 mm. Female lay clutches of 1-15 eggs on the top or the bottom surface of the leaves.\n\n\n=== Larvae ===\nEggs develop into larvae about 5–8 days. Larvae have a dark brown to black color with a length of 5.2mm. Their body structure is composed of 10 segments with three pairs of short legs near the head. he larvae live and feed on the leaves where they are oviposited. There are three instars during the larval stage where the smaller larvae live at the bottom of the host leaves and the larger larvae live at the top and feed on the leaves of the host plants. The larvae stay in clutches upon feeding.\n\n\n=== Pupae ===\nLarvae leave the host plant and pupate into the ground or leaf litter. The larvae would form a case for themselves to live through the pupation and overwinter, which is made of mucus from the maxillary glands.\n\n\n=== Adult ===\nPupation ends in the next spring and adult beetles emerge from the case. Adults feed on the leaves of the host plant. Adult females generally have a larger body size than adult males. The female may reproduce one to three generations each year. Adults living in northern latitudes usually have one generation per year and adults living in southern latitudes may have more generations.\n\n\n== Protective behavior ==\n\n\n=== Hole-feeding camouflage ===\nA. cirsicola, along with some other leaf beetle species, create uniform holes while they feed on the leaves of their host plant food resources. Ren et al. (2018) demonstrated that these holes help to camouflage the species by changing the background environment of which the beetle interacts. Using a computer program and human participants to model potential predators in the wild, the researchers found that the presence of the holes in the leaves made it more difficult for humans to identify the A. cirsicola beetles. The difficulty in identifying the beetles increased when there were more holes present in the leaves and when the size of the holes were similar to the size of the beetles. Through analysis of the feeding behaviors of A. cirsicola, it was also suggested that the species may optimize their feeding to allow for hole sizes and quantities that increase the efficacy of its camouflage. Although the study used humans to model predators, the researchers believe the primary predators that may have led to the hole-feeding camouflage behavior are birds. Because birds primarily use visual cues to find the insects, it is believed that the hole-feeding camouflage greatly helps the beetles avoid such predators.\n\n\n=== Jumping ===\nAnother behavior that A. cirsicola exhibits that helps it to avoid predators is jumping. Jumping is a protective behavior found among many insects, but there have been extensive studies investigating the mechanisms of jumping in A. cirsicola and other flea beetles. A. cirsicola is able to jump far distances that are much longer in length than its own body length. In the wild, it is believed that the species jumps into leave clusters to quickly escape from predators.\n\n\n== Mating ==\nLike other Altica species, A. cirsicola males and females mate multiple times throughout their lives. Both males and females may have multiple sexual partners throughout their lives. Copulation in the species typically has a duration of approximately 20 minutes. After copulation, mate guarding may occur, which may prevent other opportunities to mate for the beetle that is guarded. This mate guarding may occur for multiple hours after copulation.\n\n\n=== Male choice ===\nAlthough male mate choice is typically less common in animals, it has been found that male mate choice may be selected for in A. cirsicola. Because A. cirsicola populations have generations that overlap and are typically clustered together, males of the species usually encounter both sexually immature and mature females, and also may encounter other males or even beetles of other Altica species. Because of the wide variety of encounters that male A. cirsicola have during their lives, they are able to identify the sex of other individuals and, if they are female, whether or not they are sexually mature.\nIt has been found that A. cirsicola males do not use behavioral cues to find mates. One study by Xue et al. (2016) has demonstrated that cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) play a role in identifying potential mates. CHCs are chains of hydrocarbons that cover the cuticles of most insects that typically play roles in communication and providing waterproofing qualities. It has been discovered that in A. cirsicola, the chemical makeup of CHCs differ by sex and sexual maturity. Males may use an assessment of these differences to help them identify mates. However, it is believed by researchers that other unknown signals also play a role in male mate choice, and the use of CHCs is only one component.\n\n\n== Physiology ==\nAdult Altica cirsicola have a width of approximately 2 mm and a length of approximately 4mm. The adult beetles have wings that are often used to assist with jumping. Their body shapes are elongated and their sides are somewhat convex. They are a dark blue in color and have a metallic quality, along with some purple tones. A. cirsicola is very visually similar to another flea beetle species, Altica carduorum, and it is very difficult to reliably distinguish between the two species morphologically. Despite their morphological similarities, DNA analysis suggests that the two are separate species.\n\n\n=== Jumping mechanism ===\nA. cirsicola has the ability to jump, which allows it to quickly escape from predators. The jumping process of A. cirsicola, along with several other flea beetles, has been described to consist of four steps. The first step is a preparation phase, where the beetle contracts the muscles in its hind legs. The second step is an initiation phase, where strain is built up in the femur, allowing the femur to act somewhat like a catapult. The third step is very brief, and it consists of an accumulation of strain that can no longer be held, leading to the trigger of the jump. Finally, in the fourth step, the beetle is catapulted from the ground and the strain is released so the muscles start to relax.\nThe jumping mechanism of A. cirsicola and other flea beetles is described to be very efficient, as it allows the beetles to jump extremely far distances relative to the length of their body in a very short amount of time. Furthermore, the beetles are able to jump repeatedly for over 30 jumps without becoming greatly tired.  The efficient nature of the jumping mechanism in these beetles has inspired a design of a bionic leg that can jump, which could possibly be used in robots.\nOne study by Zong et al. (2022) investigated the landing of A. cirsicola onto inclined platforms after jumping. This study found that A. cirsicola has three noticeably different modes that are used when jumping, which varies between individuals. One mode is termed the \"wingless mode\", in which the wings of the beetle are closed while it jumps and remain closed while in the air. Another mode is termed the \"intermediate mode\", in which the wings of the beetle are closed initially but are then opened while in the air. It is suspected that in this mode, the wings are opened to help reduce spinning. The last mode is termed the \"winged mode\", where the beetle uses its wings by flapping while taking off. It was found that the \"wingless mode\" was the most common mode used to jump, but most individuals preferred a particular mode. It was also found that the use of wings led to slower jumps, which helped to decrease the impact of the landing on the beetles.\n\n\n== Microbiome ==\nA. cirsicola have microbial communities in their gut that may provide several benefits. In a study by Wei et al. (2020) investigating the gut microbiomes of three sympatric Altica beetle species (A. cirsicola, A. fragariae, and A. viridicyanea), it was found that treating Altica beetles with antibiotics led to negative effects on the development of the beetles. The microbiomes in these species may provide several benefits, such as providing nutrients that may promote growth and helping with the digestion of compounds from plant food resources that may be toxic to the beetles.\nAlthough the three species of Altica beetles in the aforementioned study feed on different species of plants, it was found that the bacterial communities did not vary significantly between the beetle species. Thus, it is believed that the three sympatric Altica beetles may obtain their gut microbiome from a shared source, such as the soil, rather than from their respective plant food resources. Although there were not significant differences in the gut bacterial composition across the three species, it was found that the geographic location in which the beetles were obtained did have an effect on the types of bacteria present in their gut.\nWolbachia are bacteria that can live inside beetles and impact their reproductive isolation. Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and high Wolbachia infection rates are seen in Altica beetles. In a study investigating the effects of Wolbachia on Altica species, Wolbachia had a 100% infection rate in A. cirsicola. MLST Wolbachia genes showed three sequence types in A. cirsicola. The dominant strain type ST505 was in A. cirsicola.Phylogenetic analysis revealed 7 Wolbachia sequences were under a supergroup called supergroup B. The dominant Wolbachia strain in A. cirsicola (ST505) is related to ST348 which is a strain in supergroup A.\nTo investigate Wolbachia’s effect on mating, infected males were crossed with cured females. This revealed no changes in hatching success. Antibiotics had no effect on hatching success either. CI from Wolbachia can also lead to new insect species. Multiple Wolbachia strains in different species of Altica beetles but no change in hatching success shows CI does not play a factor in reproduction in the Altica beetles specifically.\n\n\n== Interaction with environment ==\n\n\n=== Control method for Canada Thistle ===\nA. cirsicola may also serve as a potential biological control method for the Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense. The Canada thistle is an invasive species of plant that is known to lead to crop damage. A similar species of beetle, Altica carduorum, was used in the 1960s as a method of controlling the Canada thistle in North America, but this effort was not effective. Preliminary findings have suggested that A. cirsicola may be another potential method of controlling the Canada thistle.\nA. cirsicola and A. carduorum are two beetle species that are very similar physiologically. Both have features such as elongated body shapes and slightly convex sides. Their body and appendages have a dark metallic blue color with faint purple coloring. This has implications when considering the beetles as control methods for the Canada Thistle in Canada. These beetles also show genetic similarity. There were 39 and 27 amplifiable and informative loci for A. carduorum and A. cirsicola, respectively. The genetic variation between the two species was 20%. Genetic similarity among the two species was low. This level was at 46%. This shows that A. carduorum and A. cirsicola are sibling species due to their morphological similarities. They are reproductively isolated. The genetic differences between A. caruorum and A. cirsicola indicate that they should be treated as two different species in the context of using them as control agents.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stand Round my Brave Boys is a 1745 song composed by George Frideric Handel.  It was commissioned to celebrate the Gentlemen Volunteers of the City of London, a regiment raised to resist the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. Handel had close connections with the ruling House of Hanover, and composed several tunes supportive of a loyalist position opposed to the rival Jacobite House of Stuart during his career. It was part of the patriotic fervour that also saw God Save the King adopted as a popular song. Handel's piece was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and then published on 14 November 1745. It was later included in the Jacobite Relics, a compilation of songs from the era.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBurrows, Donald. Handel.

        "content": "All Nations Baptist Church (Russian: Баптистская церковь Всех Наций) is a Russian-language Baptist congregation in Brooklyn, New York City, United States. It shares facilities with the Park Slope Community Church. The congregation is often associated with Koryo-saram: ethnic Koreans of the mainland former Soviet Union. It has been described as the only such Koryo-saram church in New York City.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe founding leader of the congregation is Leonid Kim. Kim was born in Uzbekistan. His grandparents were Koreans who lived in the Russian Far East and were forced to move to Central Asia in 1937. Kim was first introduced to Christianity at age 41, when he still lived in Uzbekistan, by a Korean-American missionary from Texas. Despite Soviet discouragement on religion, he converted and became devout. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he openly approached Korean missionaries, learned Korean, and openly attended church. He emigrated to the United States in 1995 at the invitation of the American Baptist College. From 1997, he worked as a missionary in Ukraine.He started the congregation in 2002. Initially, the congregation had four members: Kim, his wife, his son, and one other woman. By 2008, it had over 100 members. During this time, the Korean American Christian community continued to send missionaries to Central Asia in order to convert and bring more Koryo-saram to the United States. After arriving, these immigrants often needed communities and assistance, and found churches such as these to be helpful with that.According to Kim, the congregation serves some function as a community center for Koryo-saram. Some join the congregation initially because they come to ask for help on immigration issues, but end up staying for the community. In 2017, it was reported that the congregation was 60% Koryo-saram. In 2022, the demographics were reported as 30% Koryo-saram, 40% Ukrainian, and 20% Russian. The congregation has also been known to collaborate and host joint events and services with other local Korean American churches.According to Kim, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine initially caused some strife in the community that eventually healed. In 2022, the congregation collected donations and funded Kim to visit Ukraine to offer donated goods and funds, as well as his assistance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCafe Lily – a nearby Koryo-saram restaurant\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYouTube channel (in Russian)\nFacebook (in Russian)\n문석진목사가 만난 사람 01 열방교회 레오니드 김 목사 on YouTube – an interview with Kim in 2022, discussing his trip to Ukraine (in Korean)",

After graduating, he played professionally and semiprofessionally for the National Supply, Oak Harbor American Legion, Scott Shops, and Toledo Red Man Tobaccos teams.\n\n\n== Coaching ==\nBoldt served as an assistant at Woodward Tech while attending the University of Toledo. After graduating, he was the head basketball and baseball coach at Point Place High School.  In 1932, the Point Place baseball team won the Class B District championship. The high school closed in 1937 after Point Place was annexed into the city of Toledo and Boldt became a teacher at the Point Place Junior High School.\nBoldt returned to coaching in 1944, when he was named head basketball coach at the University of Toledo. Toledo played a limited schedule that season due to World War II finish the year with a 9–4 record. The war ended in time for the school to arrange a stronger schedule for the 1945–46 season and the Rockets went 20–7. Boldt resigned after the season allow a full-time coach to be hired, but returned in 1947 as an assistant to Jerry Bush. Boldt coached the team for the first two games of the 1952–53 season while Bush was away on a scouting trip. He resigned in 1954, as the university wanted an assistant basketball coach who was a full-time staff member while Boldt did not want to lose his tenure in the Toledo City School District.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nFrom 1949 until his retirement in 1966, Boldt was a social studies and orientation teacher at Macomber High School. In 1953, he coached the Macomber tennis team to the city championship. He also served as manager of the Jermain Park tennis courts from 1947 to 1965. He died on March 13, 1972, at St. Luke's Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sendō Kofun (仙道古墳)  is a Kofun period Decorated kofun burial mound, located in the Hisamitsu neighborhood of the town of  Chikuzen,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1978.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Sendō Kofun  is located in the northern part of the Chikugo Plain, at the foot of the Amidagamine Hills, which extends south from the Asakura Mountains. Approximately 50  enpun (円墳)-style circular tumuli, in the area make up the Amidagamine Kofun Cluster, and Sendō Tumulus is the largest of these. Archaeological excavation in 1977 revealed that it was a two-tiered tumulus with fukiishi on the surface, and that it has a diameter of about 33 meters and height of four meters. It is surrounded by a double moat, two to three meters wide and about one meter deep. The horizontal-entry stone burial chamber is orientated to the southwest, and was robbed in antiquity. The burial chamber is located in the center of the mound, and is 2 to 2.4 meters wide and 3 meters long, and the floor is covered with paving stones. Decorative murals cover the entire surface of the burial chamber. The patterns are geometric, such as circles and triangles, and the colors red and green are used. The only remaining evidence of grave goods was some small fragments of jade, possibly from a bracelet. However, anthropomorphic haniwa of warriors carrying shields and horses were discovered from the outer periphery of the mound, indicating that the tomb was constructed around the 6th century. It is a unique tumulus in that decorative kofun do not normally have haniwa. \nCurrently, the tumulus is maintained as part of an archaeological park and the burial chamber is open to the public every spring and fall. It is located 5.3 kilometers (about 15-minutes by car) northwest of Amagi Station on the Amagi Railway Amagi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nDecorated kofun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nChikuzen Town home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The moderate groups, centrist camp, or moderate camp is Hong Kong's moderate political alignment.\n\n\n== Political position ==\nThe moderate groups represents a moderate view between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps. However, depending on the political party, it may be partly closer to the pro-Beijing or pro-democracy.\nAlthough they are not actively pro-government at the level of the pro-Beijing camp, the moderate groups is people interact with the mainland Chinese government, unlike the pro-democracy camp; Ronny Tong on the Path of Democracy entered the Executive Council of Hong Kong, Chow Yick Hay (周奕希) on the Third Side is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference member based on Zhaoqing, Chow also became vice-chairman of the Kwai Tsing District Council with the help of the pro-Beijing camp, Wong Sing-chi on the Third Side was appointed by the government to be a member of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, and even Christine Fong is partly related to pro-Beijing organizations.\n\n\n== History ==\nPolitical events such as the Umbrella Movement and Waiting for Uncle Fat led to social differentiation; the pro-democracy camp was divided and some formed the localist camp.\nIn 2015, Ronny Tong, a member of the Civic Party, left the Civic Party and resigned as a member of the Legislative Council, advocated political reform, and formed a centrist organization, 'Path of Democracy'. Around the same time, former Legislative Council member Tik Chi-yuen of the Democratic Party bolted from the party and formed the 'Third Side' with Wong Sing-chi, another former Legislative Council member who was expelled from the Democratic Party.\nA 2015 poll by The University of Hong Kong found that 41.9% of moderate groups supporters, 28.4% of pro-democracy camp supporters, and 11.4% of pro-Beijing camp supporters.\nChristine Fong and Wong Sing-chi, classified as moderate groups in the 2016 New Territories East by-election, lost to Alvin Yeung, classified as pro-democracy camp. At the time, Christine Fong received 33,424 votes, while Wong Singh-chi received 17,257 votes; in New Territories, moderate groups received about 12%.\nThird Side chairman Tik Chi-yuen claims that voters abandoned the centrist line and voted for a pro-Beijing camp because of the 'Returning to the Edge Effect' (歸邊效應) in the election. He analyzed that the moderate groups is likely to win 1 seat in the New Territories if it works with politicians who belong to the moderate groups at the 2016 Hong Kong legislative election.\nIn the 2016 Hong Kong legislative election; Wong Singh-chi bolted from the Third Side and ran for the Social Welfare functional constitution, Tik Chi-yuen ran for the Kowloon West, Christine Fong was eliminated from 10th place with 34,544 votes in the eastern district of New Territories, the Path of Democracy sent two lists to Hong Kong Island and the eastern part of the New Territories and losing with 10,028 and 8,084 votes (respectively, which was a very small number of votes, resulting in the confiscation of the election deposit).\nOn 1 July 2017, Ronny Tong joined the Executive Council of Hong Kong composition.\nIn January 2018, the pro-democracy camp decided to hold a primary election to select candidates for the March 2018 Hong Kong by-elections, and Frederick Fung, who was still a member of Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) at that time, became a preliminary candidate (\"Plan B\"), but the pro-democracy camp persuaded Frederick Fung to give up his position as \"Plan B\". Under the pressure of various parties, Frederick Fung announced that he would give up his position, and at the same time, it sowed the seeds of Frederick Fung's defection from the pro-democracy camp.\nIn July 2018, Frederick Fung withdrew from ADPL, and in September, he expressed his intention to run in the by-election to show his opposition to the pro-democracy camp's preordaining of Lee Cheuk-yan to serve as preliminary candidate (\"Plan B\"). After Frederick Fung's break with the pro-democracy camp, ADPL immediately expressed its stance in support of Lee Cheuk-yan. During the canvassing period of the by-election, Frederick Fung was criticized by Lee Cheuk-yan for \"vote rigging\", which had a negative impact on the pro-democracy camp, describing him as \"Team B of the pro-establishment camp\". In the end, both Lee Cheuk-yan and Frederick Fung lost the by-election because their combined votes were less than that of Chan Hoi-yan, the representative of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.\nIn 2019, the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement caused a backlash from Hong Kong public opinion, and Ronny Tong, as an executive council member, intensified the confrontation over the Hong Kong government's Extradition Law. After the Umbrella Movement, political conflict in Hong Kong society intensified again, narrowing the political space of the moderate groups. At the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, the moderate groups won only four seats, and all four running for Ronny Tong's Path of Democracy lost with a low vote and their election deposit was confiscated.\nIn 2020, Hope for Hong Kong was founded; the majority of its members are from or related to pro-business parties. However, the party was disbanded after a year.\nIn the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, only one Tik Chi-yuen was elected from several moderate groups figures.\n\n\n== Political organizations ==\nProfessional Power (2010–present)\nPath of Democracy (2015–present)\nThird Side (2016–present)\nHope for Hong Kong (2020–2021)\nHK Round Table On People’s Livelihood (2022–present)\nThe Roundtable is not part of the moderate groups but has a moderate view among the pro-Beijing camp parties and is friendly to the moderate groups.\n\n\n== In Macau ==\nIn Macau, there are political party that claim to be \"中間派\" between pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps, it is Synergy of Macao founded in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Country Club Lima Hotel is a five-star hotel in San Isidro District, Lima, Peru. It was inaugurated on February 8, 1927, as the most exclusive country club in Lima before being reorganised as a hotel. It is part of the Cultural heritage of Peru.\nThe hotel has housed a number of important personalities of the 20th century, including the Duke of Windsor and his wife, French President Charles de Gaulle, U.S. President Richard Nixon, writer Ernest Hemingway, actors Ava Gardner and John Wayne, musician Mick Jagger, among others.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1925 the Sociedad Anónima Propietaria del Country Club was formed with a capital of Lp. 150,000, with the purpose of building developing the adjoining area of 1,300,000 m2 acquired from the Conde de San Isidro, Lobatón, Matalechuzas and Orrantia estates. The sale of the land was calculated at S/. 15 per urbanised m2 to reinvest part of the profits in building's construction.\nIn 1926 Lima Country Club was founded, an independent company from the previous one, which contracted the preparation of the architectural project for the club's premises. The project's execution was entrusted to the American architect T.J. O'Brien, who completed the project and inspected the construction, whose materials were imported from the United States and Great Britain.\nThe premises were inaugurated on Sunday, February 8, 1927, by President Augusto B. Leguía. There was a lunch for the President, his Cabinet of Ministers and a series of political, intellectual and artistic personalities of the city. Up until the 1970s, it was the meeting point for the Peruvian elite and the city's British colony, also receiving important guests from other countries, such as the adbicated Duke of Windsor and his wife, French President Charles de Gaulle, U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway, and actress Ava Gardner, among others.\nAfter being negatively affected during the economic crisis of the 1980s, it was acquired by the Consorcio Inmobiliario Los Portales and ICA in 1996, who invested in the hotel's renovation, being reinaugurated on July 21, 1998. It was subsequently declared part of the Cultural heritage of Peru by the Ministry of Culture and the National Institute of Culture.\nIt was again renovated from 2015 to 2017. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, the hotel remained open as it adopted the biosecurity measures mandated by the Peruvian government.\nThe hotel restaurant, Perroquet, has won first place for \"Best Hotel Restaurant\" in several international awards for several years. The hotel's traditional English bar is recognized for having one of the best pisco sours in the city, and in 2012, 2013 and 2022 it was awarded as the best bar in Lima according to the SUMMUM awards.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe hotel is featured in two novels by Alfredo Bryce, Un mundo para Julius and No me esperen en abril, being a prominent part of the latter's story.\nPeruvian saxophonist Jean Pierre Magnet, member of Traffic Sound, started his career in the club.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmbassy of China, Lima, located behind the hotel.\nDelfines Hotel & Convention Center, located next to the hotel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oda Chausutsuka Kofun (小田茶臼塚古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Oda neighborhood of former Amagi city in what is now part of the city of Asakura, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1979. It is believed to have been built in the late 5th century.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Oda Chausutsuka Kofun is located on the eastern edge of the Chikugo Plain, on the right bank of the Sada River, a tributary of the Chikugo River. Its existence has been known for a long time, and it is listed in a local history texts on Chikuzen Province in 1798 and 1863. The total length of the tumulus is 54.5 meters, and it is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above.  The diameter of the posterior circular portion is 39.7 meters, and the width of the rectangular anterior portion is  25 meters, narrowing to 14.5 meter at the construction between the two portions. The length of this anterior portion is only 14.5 meters, which is short for a typical tumulus of this style. The height of the tumulus os 5 meters. The tumulus is orientated to the north, but the opening for the horizontal passage-style stone burial chamber is to the southwest. This chamber measures 3.5 meters long by 2.2 meters wide and 1.6 meters high. The tumulus was surrounded by a moat 4 meters wide and 0.6 meters deep.  \nThe posterior circular part was constructed in three stages, with the bottom stage being carved out of the ground, and the second and higher stages being mounds with fukiishi. The anterior part was built in two stages, and in the second stage a row of cylindrical and \"morning-glory shaped\" haniwa was detected. Additionally, a large Sue ware jar and a utensil stand were placed above the constriction.\nDuring the construction of a road in 1928, the southeastern portion of the posterior circular part was destroyed and the burial chamber exposed. A local teacher from Asakura Junior High School (currently Asakura High School) conducted a survey, and many of the excavated grave goods are still stored at the school. A formal archaeological excavation was not conducted until 1973. The grave goods recovered in 1928 included a short armor with horizontal strips, a helmet,  a pauldron, an iron sword, two iron spears, five iron bars, a bundle of iron arrowheads, eight cyliindrical beads, 226 round glass beads, and 161 small beads. Also found were horse harnesses, a four-ringed bell, stone pestle and ancient Sue ware pottery.\nApproximately three kilometers north of the tumulus is the Amagi Historical Museum, which displays excavated items. The tumulus itself is approximately eight minutes by car from Amagi Station on the Amagi Railway Amagi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAsakura city home page (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Mirza Bakhish Nadim (Azerbaijani: Mirzə Baxış Nadim; 1785; Navahı, Javad Khanate – 1880; Navahı, Javad uezd, Baku Governorate, Russian Empire) was an Azerbaijani Turkish poet and satirist who lived in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMirza Bakhish Nadim was born in 1785 in Navahi village in a religious family. His family was originally from the city of Shamakhi. His father, Molla Asadullah, was one of the open-minded people of his time and raised his son in this way. Mirza Bakhish received his first education at home from his father, then he was sent to Shamakhi Madrasah. While studying at the madrasa, he also learned Arabic and Persian languages. After finishing his education, he returned to Navahi and started working here. Mirza Bakhish worked for the settlement of land and other issues of the peasants in the state bodies, for this he often represented the peasants in meetings with the state bodies in Salyan, Shamakhi and Baku. Because of this work, he was given the nickname Mirza. He was fired from his job due to problems with state authorities, but was later appointed to the position of head of the Pirsaat river water department. He died in Navahi village in 1880.\n\n\n== Creativity ==\nMirza Bakhish Nadim, like most of his contemporaries, wrote both in the style of traditional ashug  and classical poetry. His work includes a large number of goshmas, geraylis, ghazals, mukhammas, tarjibands, tarkibbends, hijvs and satire. Its satires “The Great Hungry Year in Navagi and the neighboring village in 1879”, “Description of the winter”, \"The work of the water chief\" against the beys and khans brought him wide fame. In an important part of his poems, he criticized the rules and laws of his time, state bodies, beys and khans.\nOne of Nadim's significant works is a historical poem describing the conquest of the Ganja, Shirvan, Baku, Guba, Erivan and Derbent khanates by the Russian Empire. He describes various bloody battle scenes of the Azerbaijani khanates, the conquest of Ganja, the oppression of the Azerbaijani peasants. The poet also described the hard and difficult life of the people, and in passages complained about his financial difficulties. His poems of this type include the satires \"Egyptian grandson of Imamverdi\", \"Murad Khan\", \"Karbalayi\", \"Mahmud\". His satirical poems were similar to the poems of Gasim Bey Zakir.\nMirza Bakhish's works, which were not published in the press of that time, were considered lost for a long time. Thus, until 2017, only a few poems of Mirza Bakish were known. However, in 2017, employees of the Institute of Manuscripts of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, Pasha Karimov and Ragub Karimov, discovered two collections of handwritten poems. A book was prepared based on these poems. During the examination of these new works, it became clear that Mirza Bakhish was the author of many lyrical and religious poems as well as satirical poems. According to researchers, there are still manuscripts of his poems. It is likely that after the discovery of these works, a complete idea of his creativity can be given.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nQasımzadə, Feyzulla, ed. (2017).

        "content": "Event-Space: Theatre Architecture and the Historical Avant-Garde is a book by New Zealand scholar and author Dorita Hannah. It was published in 2018 by Routledge. The book delves into the avant-garde movement's departure from traditional theatre spaces in favor of more unconventional venues, exploring the significance of 'event' as a central concept in modernism's revolutionary agenda. Through the lens of performance and architectural studies, Hannah establishes a theory of 'performative architecture', shedding light on historical avant-garde performance while offering insights for contemporary approaches to performance space design.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book explores the interplay between performance and architecture from Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus to Artaud's avant-garde works. Hannah introduces the concept of 'event-space' to analyze this relationship, delving into the divergent attitudes towards performance space during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through meticulous examination, the book connects key figures and movements, such as symbolism, constructivism, and surrealism, to their impact on theatre design. It navigates through the evolution of spatial performativity, from absolute space to abstract space and abject space, shedding light on the complexities within modernist architecture and performance art. Hannah's analysis is enriched by visual imagery and offers fresh perspectives on well-known figures and spaces. Ultimately, \"Event-Space\" serves as a significant contribution to understanding the intricate dynamics between architecture and performance, appealing to scholars, artists, and enthusiasts alike.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAndrew Filmer judged the book as a remarkable text and lauded Hannah's insightful exploration of spatial performativity during the historic avant-garde period. He admired the author's adept analysis of the schism between architectural rationalism and artistic avant-garde's challenges to convention, highlighting her nuanced readings of key events, scenes, and spaces.

It is one of the oldest streets in the area, the name dating back to the Bollobridge over Stamford Brook in the twelfth century. The earliest reference to the street is as Bolhollane in 1408, the name meaning the \"lane at Bull Hollow\". It marks the boundary between the London Borough of Ealing to the north and the London Borough of Hounslow to the south. The Bollo pub is located in the street nearer to the Chiswick Park end.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKnights, David and Amanda. Acton Through Time.

It is operated by Centrenergo. It had an installed capacity of 2,400 MWe and was mostly fuelled by coal. The plant was mostly destroyed during the 22 March 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the powerplant was approved in 1955 and it started operations in 1960.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the plant was damaged by Russian in September 2022.  Four civilian workers at the power plant died during that incident and electricity and water delivery was affected. The damage was repaired later.\nIn 2023 the plant was foritifed against war damage, with additions of protective structures around critical elements of the plant's facilities which was supposed to protect them against \"rocket fragments, indirect UAV attacks\" and similar threats.\n\nDuring the 22 March 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine, the plant has sustained major damage due to Russian bombardment and has been described as destroyed. Representative of its operating company, Centrenergo, noted that due to extensive damage, repairs will take long time and require international aid.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, power outages affected some 700,000 of the region inhabitants; several days later, over 100,000 were still affected and an hourly blackout schedule had to be implemented. Zmiivska plant was one of several energy infrastructure objects damaged during the 22 March attacks; three days after the attack the combined heat and power plant Kharkiv TEC-5 was stated to have ceased operation due to the damaged it had suffered during the attack.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRussian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "LiveView Technologies (LVT) is a video surveillance company based in Orem, Utah. It was founded by Ryan Porter and Bob Brenner in 2005.\n\nThe company creates the D3 Mobile Security Unit, a solar-powered surveillance trailer with cameras on a 22-foot pole, a two-way audio system, and blue flashing lights. The trailers are often placed in retail parking lots and paid for by retailers including Advance Auto Parts, Home Depot, Kroger, Lowes, Safeway, Walgreens, and Walmart.\nOroville, California's police department pays $45,000 per year for one LVT trailer. Another source placed the price at $3000 per month. An LVT trailer in a San Francisco Safeway parking lot played classical music at a loud level 24 hours per day for at least a week to deter loitering, per Safeway's corporate response. The 24/7 music has also been used in an LVT at a Home Depot in Denver.\nLVT has been the main jersey sponsor of NBA's Utah Jazz since 2023, in a deal organized by Klutch Sports Group.\nLVT has installed solar-powered cameras for the State of Utah along the state's creeks and rivers to detect flooding.\nThe company announced its $50 million Series B round in June 2022. Sorenson Capital, Pelion Ventures, The Larry H. Miller Group, and Lead Edge Capital are funders.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

A timber bridge at the location was first recorded in the 12th century, and again in 1322, at the time of the Battle of Boroughbridge.  In 1562, the bridge was rebuilt in stone.  It was widened between 1782 and 1785 by John Carr of York and John Gott, surveyors for the North and West Ridings, respectively.  The southern section of the bridge collapsed and had to be entirely reconstructed.  The bridge was Grade II listed in 1966.The bridge is built of sandstone, and has three segmental arches.  There are two pointed cutwaters on the east side and semicircular cutwaters on the west, carried up as buttresses.  Under the arches are five wide ribs.  The parapets continue beyond the bridge to the north, and have square terminals.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Spice and Wolf: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf is an anime television series based on the light novel series Spice and Wolf written by Isuna Hasekura and illustrated by Jū Ayakura. The story follows a 25-year-old traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence who meets Holo, a female wolf deity of harvest. Holo, bound to a nearby town by an old promise to ensure a good wheat harvest every year, escapes with Lawrence when the townspeople stop believing in her. Lawrence promises to take her north to her homeland, Yoitsu, while she helps him with his business transactions along the way in return.\nA new anime adaptation was announced in February 2022, as part of the light novel's 15-year anniversary. It was later confirmed to be a rebooted anime series produced by Passione and directed by Hijiri Sanpei, with Takahashi returning from the previous adaptation as chief director, Kevin Penkin composing the music, and Fukuyama and Koshimizu returning to reprise their roles as Lawrence and Holo respectively. The series premiered on April 2, 2024, on TV Tokyo, TV Osaka, TV Aichi, BS TV Tokyo and AT-X. The opening theme song is \"Tabi no Yukue\" (旅のゆくえ, lit. 'Journey's Destination') performed by Hana Hope, while the ending theme song is \"Andante\" (アンダンテ) performed by ClariS. Crunchyroll has licensed the series outside of Asia. In March 2024, Netflix announced that it would be streaming the series in select Asian regions.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Spice and Wolf episodes\nList of Spice and Wolf light novels\nList of Spice and Wolf chapters\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial anime website (in Japanese)\nOfficial website at Crunchyroll\nSpice and Wolf: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf at IMDb\nSpice and Wolf: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf (anime) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia",

        "content": "RemArms, LLC, is an American holding company that operates the firearms manufacturing portion of the former Remington Arms company. Based in Ilion, New York, the company is relocating its headquarters to LaGrange, Georgia.\n\n\n== History ==\nRemington Arms was a notable American manufacturer of firearms, founded in 1816 by Eliphalet Remington and originally known as E. Remington and Sons. The company was acquired in June 2007 by a private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. It became part of the firm's Freedom Group, which was renamed in 2015 as Remington Outdoor Company. Remington Outdoor Company declared bankruptcy in 2018, from which it emerged, and in 2020, following which it was broken up.\nThe firearm portion of Remington Arms (excluding Marlin Firearms) was sold to Roundhill Group, LLC, and was then organized as RemArms, LLC. Vista Outdoor purchased Remington Arms' ammunition business, which it subsequently organized as Remington Ammunition. Vista Outdoor also purchased various intellectual property, including the Remington brand name. RemArms licensed use of the brand name from Vista Outdoor in order to market its products using Remington Firearms branding.\nBoth Remington Firearms and Remington Ammunition appear to claim Remington Arms' history, the former noting in a 2021 press release, \"Founded in 1816, Remington Firearms is one of the nation’s oldest firearms brands, operating for 205 years\" and the latter noting on its website \"We’ve been here since 1816.\"\nRemArms obtained a Federal Firearms License in early 2021, and resumed production of some firearms at the former-Remington Arms manufacturing facility in Ilion, New York. The company announced its launch in September 2021, via a video from its CEO.\nIn November 2021, the company announced it would relocate its global headquarters to LaGrange, Georgia, with plans to contain a new advanced manufacturing operation and a research and development center. In November 2023, it was reported that the company would end its operations in Ilion in March 2024 with approximately 250 to 300 employees affected by the plant closure. The plant's union representative, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), condemned the planned closure. Closure of the company's manufacturing operations in Ilion was reported to be imminent in mid-March 2024.\nAs of March 2024, the company lists approximately 25 international distributors, located in:\n\nEurope: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine\nSouth America: Argentina, Chile, Panama, Uruguay\nOther: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey\n\n\n== Products ==\nRemington Arms manufactured many different models of rifles, shotguns, and handguns during its existence.\n\nA smaller number of products have been offered under the Remington Firearms brand. As of March 2024, the following models are listed on the company's website:\n\n\n=== Rifles ===\nRemington Model 700 (bolt action)\nMuzzleloader variant also offered\nRemington Model 783 (bolt action)\n\n\n=== Shotguns ===\nRemington V3 (autoloading)\nTactical variant also offered\nRemington Model 1100 (autoloading)\nRemington Model 870 (pump-action)\nTactical variants also offered\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Place Names: Approaches and Perspectives in Toponymy and Toponomastics is a book by linguists and authors Francesco Perono Cacciafoco and Francesco Paolo Cavallaro. The book explores toponymy and toponomastics. Through associating these studies with various disciplines and elucidating key methodologies with illustrative case studies, the volume provides an introduction to the origins, structures, and significance of place names worldwide. It was published in March 2023 by Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book consists of an introduction and nine core chapters in which Perono Cacciafoco and Cavallaro provide an exploration of toponymy, spanning from linguistic and etymological analyses to societal implications. Using diverse case studies from around the world, the volume develops a comprehensive exploration of place name research, covering historical and linguistic studies alongside contemporary naming practices. The authors demonstrate the significance of place names in understanding societal and environmental contexts. Through the ten chapters, various methodologies and approaches are presented, from historical toponomastics and diachronic toponymy to landscape archaeology. The book navigates through the complexities of categorizing and analyzing place names, emphasizing their role as \"linguistic fossils\". The book also delves into the evolution of naming practices over time and examines the socio-political influences on place naming. Case studies from diverse regions and chronological contexts offer concrete examples of the book's theoretical discussions.\n\n\n=== Chapters ===\nThe introductory chapter defines and presents the basics of toponymy and toponomastics.\nThe second chapter Language Change explores how toponyms, despite their status as linguistic fossils, are subject to both internal and external forces of language change, and demonstrates their crucial role in deciphering ancient writing systems like Linear B and potentially unlocking the secrets of undeciphered scripts such as Linear A.\nThe third chapter is a guide to historical toponomastics, examining linguistic and extra-linguistic analyses.\nThe fourth chapter Toponymy and the Historical-Linguistic Reconstruction of Proto-Languages explores the methods and challenges faced by toponymists in reconstructing ancient linguistic roots.\nThe fifth chapter explores diachronic toponymy, examining how oral traditions and linguistic analysis can help reconstruct place names in communities without written records, demonstrated through a study of Abui toponyms in southeast Indonesia.\nThe sixth chapter delves into the enduring relationship between landscape and place names.\nThe seventh chapter examines the interdisciplinary field of historical geography, illustrating its methods, applications in analyzing place names through archival sources, and its relevance in understanding the evolution of toponyms across different historical and contemporary contexts.\nThe eighth chapter Synchronic Toponymy explores the shift from historical approaches to synchronic toponymy.\nThe ninth chapter studies the intricate sociopolitical dynamics surrounding the use of place names.\nThe tenth chapter explores the multifaceted relationship between toponymy and cartography, highlighting the essential role of place names on maps, their historical and ideological significance, and the intriguing phenomenon of phantom place names which reflect human desires and perceptions throughout history.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn his review of the book, Swedish linguist Staffan Nyström judged it as a comprehensive and impressive work. He praised its breadth, richness in content, and its coverage of ancient and modern place names from various regions worldwide. Nyström highlighted the book's success in exploring place names from diverse angles, considering linguistic, societal, and historical perspectives. He noted the authors' adeptness at connecting names to the societies and environments where they originate, emphasizing the influence of aesthetics, ideologies, and power dynamics. Nyström found the book's discussion of place names as products of shifting human emotions and ambitions particularly insightful.\nSergei Basik said the work is a ground-breaking college textbook in toponymy and lauded its thematic range spanning from linguistic investigations to discussions on naming practices and decolonization. Basik commended the wide variety of empirical case studies from around the world, particularly highlighting the insightful examples collected during toponymic fieldwork in the context of language documentation. He also appreciated the inclusion of a meticulously crafted glossary, although he acknowledged minor shortcomings such as technical typos and geographical misapprehensions. Despite these, Basik concluded that the book is a commendable attempt to fill the gap in academic textbooks on toponymy and is insightful and enjoyable for all readers.\n\nRemus Creţan  wrote:This book brings together ideas that conceptualise the practices of place naming. Grounded in a multidisciplinary fashion – from sociolinguistics to geography – this volume is innovative as it examines place names according to their relations with histories, cultures, and societies in order to understand their historical and linguistic origins as well as the role they play in people's everyday lives.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFrancesco Perono Cacciafoco - Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University",

        "content": "Sir Clinton Driffield is a fictional police detective created by the British author J.J. Connington. He was one of numerous detectives created during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, making his first appearance in Murder in the Maze in 1927. He appeared in four subsequent novels by 1929 when Connington apparently wished to write him out following Nemesis at Raynham Parva. However, his replacement  Superintendent Ross failed to gain the same level of popularity over two novels and Sir Clinton returned in the 1931 mystery The Boathouse Riddle. He went on to appear in a further eleven novels. The last entry Common Sense Is All You Need was published the year of Connington's death in 1947 and is set in wartime Britain.\nDriffield is a former colonial official in South Africa who on returning home has taken over the role of Chief Constable of a rural English county. His cases revolve around the market town of Ambledown and the nearby country estates. The plots often mingle the \"fair play\" detective story with the country house mystery, both genres at their height at the time. He is frequently accompanied by his friend, the wealthy landowner and magistrate Wendover, who he affectionately calls squire due to his social position and traditional, conservative views.\nConnington was the pen-name of the chemist and academic Alfred Walter Stewart. While popular at the time of publication, the books went out of print in subsequent decades. One modern encyclopaedia of crime fiction describes Sir Clinton Driffield as an \"also-ran of the Golden Age\". In his 1972 work Bloody Murder the crime writer and historian Julian Symons dubbed Connington as one of the \"humdrum\" writers of detective fiction along with Freeman Wills Crofts and Cecil Street.\n\n\n== Novels ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEvans, Curtis.

Today the only monarchist organizations working at the federal level are Tradition und Leben, as well as regional groups in Bavaria and Saxony, among others, supporters of the former ruling family's such as the Wittelsbach and Witten family's. Today, most associations don't argue for the return of the former systems, but instead push for a  parliamentary system more similar to other European Kingdoms.

It was Grade II listed in 1966.The cross consists of four diagonal shafts with spurs between, in three diminishing stages, with moulded capitals.  The shafts of the middle stage have crocketed capitals, and the top stage has a crocketed capital.  The top parts have been damaged, and Nikolaus Pevsner describes them as having been \"reassembled with dubious accuracy\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Candy Mountain is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) in Washington that encompasses the slopes surrounding Candy Mountain in Benton County located southwest of Richland along the Columbia River. The viticultural area is the state's 16th AVA formally established on September 24, 2020, by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury after reviewing the petition submitted by Dr. Kevin R. Pogue, professor of geology at Whitman College, on behalf of the following industry members with wine businesses within the Candy Mountain appellation: Ramer Holtan, who is developing a commercial wine grape vineyard on Candy Mountain; Premiere Columbia Partners LLC, owners of Candy Mountain Vineyard; and Paul and Vickie Kitzke, owners of Kitzke Cellars. For wines to bear the “Candy Mountain AVA” label, at least 85% of the grapes used for production must be grown in the designated area, Candy Mountain is a sub-appellation entirely within the Yakima Valley and the expansive Columbia Valley AVAs adjacent to the eastern boundary of Goose Gap AVA and few miles southeast of Red Mountain AVA. Within the 815 acres (330 ha) minute AVA, there are currently two producing commercial vineyards, Candy Mountain Vineyard and Kitzke Cellars, which cultivate approximately 54 acres (22 ha) with future expansions for 200 acres (81 ha)\n\n\n== Terroir ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe distinguishing features of the Candy Mountain AVA are its soils and topography. Candy Mountain appellation is a segment of a series of four mountains in the area, which includes Red Mountain, Baker Mountain, and Little Badger Mountain, that are collectively referred to as “the rattles” due to their alignment with the larger Rattlesnake Mountain. Topography also distinguishes the Candy Mountain AVA from the surrounding regions which is located on the southwest-facing slope of Candy Mountain. Within the AVA, elevations range from 640 to 1,320 feet (195–402 m), and slope angles are moderate ranging from 2 to 20 degrees. Gentle slopes facilitate mechanized vineyard maintenance and harvest. A south-facing slope aspect increases the amount per unit area of solar radiation that reaches the surface and promotes photosynthesis in the grape vines, as well as grape development and maturation. By contrast, the valley floor surrounding both the entire Candy Mountain and the AVA is essentially flat, with slope angles less than 2 degrees, and is susceptible to cold air pooling and the associated frosts and freezes. Additionally, much of the land immediately surrounding the appellation is a valley floor with elevations below 640 feet (195 m). The exception is the northeastern side of Candy Mountain, which has similar elevations to the proposed AVA but were excluded due to northeasterly slope aspect and steep slope angles of up to 60 degrees.\n\n\n=== Soil ===\nThe soils of Candy Mountain are developed from wind-deposited silt (loess) and fine sand overlying sediment. The sediment is a mixture of gravel and sand that was derived directly from surging ice-age Missoula Flood waters and also includes silt and fine sand that settled out of suspension when the flood waters pooled behind downstream topographic restrictions that define Columbia Valley soils. The loess and sediment, in turn, both overlay basalt bedrock. The thickness of the flood-water sediment within the Candy Mountain AVA gradually decreases as one moves up the mountain, and the sediment is not found within the upper 70 feet (21 m) of the appellation. By contrast, the regions to the north, south, and west of the mountain and Candy Mountain are at lower elevations and, therefore, have thicker accumulations of flood sediments in their soils. According to the petition, the soils of the AVA have an effect on viticulture. The soils are fairly loose, which allows for root expansion. The soils also do not have a large water holding capacity, meaning that vineyard owners must monitor soil moisture carefully to ensure the vines have adequate access to water. Finally, the thin soils allow roots to come into contact with the underlying basalt bedrock, which is composed of calcium-rich feldspars and other minerals that are rich in iron and magnesium, such as pyroxene and olivine. The petition states that these minerals and nutrients are only present in the bedrock, so vines planted in the surrounding regions where the soil is thicker do not have the same access to these elements as vines planted within the AVA.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCandy Mountain lies 4 miles (6 km) southeast of Red Mountain and borders Goose Gap sharing similar terroir where southwest facing slopes experience warmer temperatures and more sunlight hours than any other part of the Columbia Valley. Like Red Mountain, it also has higher winds relative to the surrounding area. Temperatures on Red Mountain tend to be hotter during the growing season than those in other areas of the Yakima Valley viticultural area. The nighttime temperatures drop considerably, helping to preserve the acid levels within the grape. To support this observation, the Red Mountain petition submitted temperature data gathered from weather stations in the Washington Public Agriculture Weather System administered by Washington State University. He compared data from the weather stations of Benton City, Sunnyside, Buena, and Gleed, all located in the Yakima Valley viticultural area. The Benton City station is located on Red Mountain within its viticultural area. A comparison of average annual air temperatures for the years 1995 through 1999 shows that the Benton City station consistently had the warmest temperatures. The average temperature difference between Benton City and Gleed, the coolest site, ranged from 3.92 to 5.61 degrees. The petitioner stated that the difference of only a few degrees over the course of a growing season can produce dramatic results on the enological characteristics of wine. He further stated that Red Mountain is typically the first grape growing area in Washington State to harvest grapes because of its warmer temperatures. According to the petitioner, the warmer temperatures also help to produce fully mature, ripe grapes with exceptional balance that differ substantially in quality from those of other growing areas in the state.\nAt Benton City, the Yakima River flows past the area and provides a moderating effect on the temperature. Cool air from the northern elevations flowing to the lower river valley moves across the hillside vineyards and keeps the grapes from being overheated. This constant air movement prevents air settling and frost damage to the grapes. \nThe area has a desert climate with average annual rainfall of 5 inches (130 mm). During the growing season, daytime temperatures average 90 °F (32 °C) with nighttime temperatures dropping below 50 °F (10 °C). Vineyards rely on irrigation to supply water to the vines allowing viniters to optimize the growth cycle of their grapevines.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nWithin its 815 acres (1.3 sq mi), the minute AVA began with two producing commercial vineyards, Candy Mountain Vineyard and Kitzke Cellars, which cultivated approximately 54 acres (22 ha). Additionally, Mr. Holtan secured long-term leases from the Washington Department of Natural Resources to cultivate additional 200 acres (81 ha) of vineyards in the AVA. A copy of the lease was included in the petition as evidence of Mr. Holtan's intent to grow wine grapes. Currently, Kitzke Cellars is the only winery within the AVA, although the petition noted that other Washington wineries source from Candy Mountain grapes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTTB AVA Map",
