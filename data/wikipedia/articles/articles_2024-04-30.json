        "content": "Alberto Villaverde Llanos (7 July 1904 – 14 January 1969) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Real Unión. He was a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but he is best known for being the first-ever player from León to play in La Liga.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAlthough he was born on 7 July 1904 in León, Villaverde spent his entire career in Irun, joining the ranks of Real Unión in 1925 and playing with them for eight years until 1933. He helped his side win the Gipuzkoa Championship four times, 1925–26, 1927–28, 1929–30, and 1930–31, along with the 1927 Copa del Rey, starting in the final against Arenas Club de Getxo, which ended in a 1–0 victory, courtesy of a extra-time goal from José Echeveste.\nIn 1929, Villaverde played in the inaugural season of La Liga, and in doing so, he became the first-ever player from León to play matches in the Spanish top division. Of the 18 games that Union played, the Leonese featured in 13 of them, and although he failed to score, he did so in the next one and then in the last season in which he defended the colors of Union. It would take a full decade for another footballer from León to play in La Liga, César Rodríguez, who made his debut for Granada CF in 1939.\nVillaverde was a member of the Spanish football squad that competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but he did not play in any matches. In total, he was called up for the national team 3 times, but was unable to make his debut.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\tReal Unión\t\n\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners: 1927\nGipuzkoa Championship:\nWinners (5): 1925–26, 1927–28, 1929–30, and 1930–31\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the father of the former president of Athletic Club and mayor of Bilbao, Jesús María Duñabeitia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDuñabeitia was born in Bilbao into a family of athletes, and as a young man, he played football on the beach of Pedernales. Later he practiced athletics, and in 1918, he became the Biscayan high jump champion thanks to a jump of 1,525 meters and then established the Biscayan countryside record in salt and pepper. In 1920, he moved to Barcelona to study chemistry at the University of Barcelona, and whilst out in the Catalan capital, he took the opportunity to play football with the Espanyol first team for two seasons between 1920 and 1922.\nIn 1923, Duñabeitia returned to Bilbao to play for Athletic, then coached by Fred Pentland, and in his first season at the club, he won the 1923 Copa del Rey, starting in the final, precisely in Barcelona, where he kept a clean sheet to help his side to a 1–0 win over CE Europa; while in Barcelona some newspaper was already printing its front page with the victory of the Catalan team. In total, he played 9 official games over four seasons between 1923 and 1926.\nDuñabeitia later became a chemical engineer at the company Sociedad Española de la Dinamita. He brought athletics to Galdakao, Biscay. He died on 1 January 1980, at the age of 79.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAthletic Club\n\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners: 1923\nBiscay Championship:\nWinners: 1923 and 1924\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kiss the Blood Off My Hands is a 1940 crime thriller novel by English writer Gerald Butler. It was his first novel, originally published by Nicholson and Watson in April 1940. It quickly became a best-seller and the author was signed to a multi-book deal with Jarrolds Publishing. By 1945, the novel had sold over 232,000 copies in England alone (all during war-time). It received numerous American editions by such publishers as Farrar & Rinehart, Dell Publishing, and Carroll & Graf Publishers. The book was also translated into several languages, including French and Swedish. By 1960, it had sold in excess of 750,000 copies.\nThe narrative established Butler's distinctive hardboiled style, which led to comparisons with American writer James M. Cain. Butler's characters were also described by book critics as amoral and tougher than those introduced by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler a decade earlier.\nThe popularity of the novel led to its screen options getting purchased by numerous film production companies, including Eagle-Lion Films, Charles K. Feldman Productions, Norma Productions, Harold Hecht Productions, and Universal-International. A film was successfully made starring Joan Fontaine, Burt Lancaster, and Robert Newton, and directed by Norman Foster in 1948. A radio adaptation was broadcast in 1949 on the CBS series Lux Radio Theatre.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nBill Saunders former prisoner of war now living in London, whose experiences have left him unstable and violent. He gets into a pub fight in which he kills the publican and then flees. He hides out with the assistance of a nurse, Jane Wharton, who believes his story that the killing was an accident. Saunders is involved in another fight—this time with a police officer. He ends up behind bars, but Wharton, who is now in love with Saunders, gets him a job driving a truck delivering drugs for her medical clinic when he's released.\nMeanwhile, hoodlum Harry Carter, who witnessed the earlier bar fight, threatens to expose Saunders to the police. In return for his silence, Carter demands that Saunders cooperate with a planned robbery of his next drug delivery. When Saunders does the run, Wharton rides with him, forcing Saunders to make the delivery to avoid getting his girlfriend involved in the possibly dangerous theft. This betrayal of Carter puts the lives of Saunders and Wharton in even greater danger.\n\n\n== Background ==\nButler worked as a chemist early in his career, before becoming a writer for the advertising and public relations firm Pritchard, Wood and Partners Limited, based on Savile Row, London, eventually becoming its director. He was 33 years old when his first novel, Kiss the Blood Off My Hands, was published by Nicholson & Watson in April 1940. The novel was written as a distraction while staying in air-raid shelters while the Germans bombed London during World War II.\nKiss the Blood Off My Hands was accepted by the first publisher Butler contacted, Nicholson & Watson (whose building was ironically destroyed by a German bombing shortly after publication), and became a best-seller, leading to a publishing contract with Jarrolds Publishing and a reprint of the book. By 1945, the novel had sold over 232,000 copies in England alone (all during war-time). The Digit Books re-print of Butler's sixth novel, Choice of Two Women, published in 1960, stated that Kiss the Blood Off My Hands had sold in excess of 750,000 copies.\n\n\n== Film and radio adaptations ==\n\nIn early 1947, Eagle-Lion Films bought the film rights to Kiss the Blood Off My Hands, hoping to shoot it with Robert Donat in the lead. After the option expired, the novel's film rights were sold in mid-1947 to actor-turned-producer Burt Lancaster and his business partner, producer Harold Hecht. The film was the first project for Lancaster's new film production company, Norma Productions (financed by Universal-International), and hit the screens in October 1948. The film starred Joan Fontaine, Burt Lancaster, and Robert Newton and was released in some markets under the titles The Unafraid or Blood on My Hands, due to fundamentalist groups.\nA radio adaption was also made for the American Columbia Broadcast System program Lux Radio Theater, which was broadcast under the title The Unafraid on 21 February 1949. Fontaine and Lancaster reprised their roles from the film version, while Jay Novello, who had a smaller part in the film, played Newton's role.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nApril 1940 Nicholson and Watson, UK, first hardcover edition\n1941 Jarrolds Publishing, UK, hardcover edition\n1945 Jarrolds Publishing, UK, hardcover edition (re-print)\n7 March 1946 Farrar & Rinehart, US, hardcover edition\n1946 Presses de la Cité, France, hardcover edition under the title Les mains pures, translated in French by Jeanne Fournier-Pargoire (part of the Cosmopolis series)\n1946 Dell Publishing, US, paperback edition (part of the A Dell Mystery series, catalog Dell 197)\n1947 Ljus, Sweden, hardcover edition under the title Två mina händer rena, translated by Vanja Lantz\nDecember 1948 Dell Publishing, US, mapback paperback edition under the title The Unafraid [Kiss the Blood Off My Hands] (part of the Dell Mapback series, catalog Dell 242)\n1950 Presses de la Cité, France, paperback edition under the title Du sang sur tes mains, translated in French by Jean Weil (part of the Un mystère series, catalog 4)\n1961 Consul Books / World Distributors, UK, paperback edition\n1980 Presses de la Cité, France, paperback edition under the title Du sang sur tes mains, translated in French by Jean Weil (part of the Classiques du roman policier series, catalog 16)\n1987 Carroll & Graf Publishers, US, paperback edition\n1997 Éditions Omnibus, France, paperback edition (part of the book Polar années cinquante)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGoble, Alan.

        "content": "Thalamic gliomas are very rare, deep-seated, generally high-grade glial neoplasms that form in the thalamus, representing 1–5% of all pediatric brain tumors. Because of their difficult to reach position, they are a unique and difficult challenge for neuro-oncologists and neurosurgeons.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThalamic gliomas are most often discovered on magnetic resonance imaging following symptoms, with the most common presenting symptom being motor deficit. While a definitive diagnosis of the neoplasm cannot be made without a biopsy of the tumor, biopsies have historically been avoided due to the extreme sensitivity of the region.\n\n\n=== Bithalamic glioma ===\nA notable variant of thalamic gliomas are bithalamic gliomas. Bithalamic gliomas cross the interthalamic adhesion and occupy space in both thalami. These have poorer outcomes than unilateral thalamic gliomas.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nUnless a thalamic glioma shows aggressive behavior, they are often treated with a \"watch and wait\" approach until signs of growth occur. Thalamic gliomas can be treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or resection.\n\n\n=== Resection ===\nThalamic gliomas are among the most difficult challenges a neurosurgeon faces today. Historically, thalamic gliomas were considered inoperable. Advances in neurosurgical technology have opened up the thalamic area to resection, but conservative approaches remain popular. Microsurgical approaches are well suited for thalamic gliomas.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThalamic gliomas have a poor prognosis. In adult patients, the overall two-year survival rate is 19.7%, with low grade tumors holding a two-year survival rate of 31.0% and high-grade tumors holding a two-year survival rate of 16.5%. In pedtiatric patients, low-grade astrocytomas held a five-year survival rate of 40% while high-grade astrocyte tumors held a five-year survival rate that varies between 15% and 25%. Strangely, pediatric thalamic oligodendrogliomas appear to have a far worse prognosis than thalamic astrocytomas, with a three-year survival rate of 14% in one series.\nHigher Karnovsky performance status and CSF diversion are good prognostic markers in cases that match the criteria for glioblastoma.\nWhile the H3K27m mutation that is the distinct marker of a diffuse midline glioma is generally a very poor prognostic factor, it is unusually associated with slightly higher rates of survival in adult thalalmic glioma patients.\n\n\n== Pathology ==\nThalamic gliomas are often but not exclusively diffuse midline gliomas; other varieties of glial tumor can develop in this region.\n\n\n== Prominent patients ==\nTammi Terrell (1945–1970), Motown singer that died from an \"acorn size\" tumor in her thalamus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThalamic Glioma Registry at Weill Cornell\nChildhood Thalamic and Hypothalamic Astrocytoma at Dana Farber\nThalamic tumors at Neurosurgical Atlas",

        "content": "On July 21, 2020, jihadists from Islamic State – Sinai Province (ISSP) attacked an Egyptian military camp in the village of Rabaa, on the outskirts of Bir al-Abd, Sinai Peninsula. The attack was in preparation for a larger assault on an Egyptian security complex in the town, but Egyptian forces repelled the attack. ISSP militants then fled and captured four towns near Bir el-Abd, which they occupied until October. Booby-trapped buildings in the towns then killed fourteen civilians. The attack was the most significant attack by ISSP against Egyptian forces in several years.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe town of Bir el-Abd became a target for the Islamic State's Sinai Province in 2018 following a heavy focus on the city of Arish by Egyptian forces after an attack on a mosque in Arish by ISSP killed over three hundred worshippers. ISSP intensified its campaign in and around the city, with pamphlets naming government sympathizers that would be beheaded, attacks on Dawarga tribesmen, and kidnapping villagers in areas controlled by the Union of Sinai Tribes, a pro-Egyptian tribal militia.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack began with two car bombers at an Egyptian military camp in Rabaa, on the outskirts of Bir el-Abd, by ISSP. Dozens of ISSP militants then attacked the Egyptian camp on foot. The Egyptian military released a statement accusing the jihadists of planning to launch an attack on Egyptian security complexes in the town of Bir el-Abd, and that a shootout with the militants left two soldiers killed and four injured, as well as eighteen jihadists dead. ISSP released a statement claiming that the attack had killed forty Egyptian soldiers, and injured sixty others. The militants fled west, and occupied four villages of Qatiya, Iqtiya, Ganayen, and Merih. \nISSP militants, once reaching the villages, set up roadblocks and planted the flags of the Islamic State in the villages. Villagers in the occupied towns attempted to flee the Islamic State in the wake of the attack, and locals affiliated with the Egyptian army were executed by the group. Over the following days, several Egyptian military officers were abducted and executed in and around the villages. Egyptian forces surrounded the villages, and captured all four in October 2020 after a slow siege that began in August. Little is known about what occurred in the villages between August and October due to the Egyptian government banning media from reporting in the Sinai Peninsula.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the Egyptian Army's recapture of all four villages, residents stated that they still felt unsafe and that the army's negligence in removing mines posed a danger to returning residents. ISSP had booby-trapped many areas in the villages, and some residents stated that ISSP still had a presence there despite Egyptian forces nearby. On October 10, two women returning home were killed by a mine in Qatiya, and four people were killed and one injured in a mine explosion in their home in Iqtiya in October 12. Two people were killed each in Genayen and Merih, and one was injured in Genayan. On October 24, five people were killed in a mine explosion in Iqtiya.\nThe Islamic State pushed westward after they were kicked out of the four villages, and began another campaign of assassinations against Egyptian officials. These attacks mainly targeted the Air Defense Forces of the Egyptian Army, with one attack killing ADF Major Mahmoud Reda.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Chapman is an English philosopher, teacher and writer, best known for their work on neurodiversity studies and the philosophy of disability.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDuring their childhood, Chapman lived in low-income housing in London and, later, elsewhere in England. They struggled with learning problems and left school at age 15. After living with friends, Chapman became a beggar. After dealing with winter conditions, Chapman entered the foster care system. \nDuring the 2000s, Chapman studied philosophy at the University of Southampton. In 2012, after being diagnosed with autism, they completed their master's degree and began their doctorate at the University of Essex with a focus on neurodiversity as a theory, developing a concept of autistic prosperity. They defended their thesis in 2018. Chapman is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.\n\n\n== Carrer ==\nUntil mid-2022, Chapman served as a senior lecturer in education at Sheffield Hallam University. Beginning in 2023, they became an assistant professor at Durham University, in the field of critical neurodiversity studies. Outside of academic activity, Chapman has also written articles for Psychology Today.\nIn 2023, Robert published the book Empire of Normality: Neurodiversity and Capitalism, which focused on developing a Marxist perspective on neurodiversity.\n\n\n== Positions ==\n\n\n=== Neurodiversity ===\nChapman defines the neurodiversity movement as a social justice movement that aims to change the way mental disability and neurodevelopmental conditions are observed with the goal of being perceived in a socio-ecological approach to disability. They make frequent references to authors such as Nick Walker and Judy Singer and those authors' proposals for conceptualizing neurodiversity. Chapman argues that, historically, neurodiversity as a movement has had a political approach based on identity, which, from their perspective, is a liberal view.\nChapman argues that the correct interpretation of the concept of neurodiversity contributes to the further development of its theoretical and practical side, and that its multiple definitions are evolving over time. They have also discussed the relationship of neurodiversity to explanatory models of disability, such as the social model of disability and the value-neutral model proposed by philosopher Elizabeth Barnes.\nGerald Roche has argued that Chapman's definition of neurodivergent Marxism is “an intersectional approach to analysing how capitalism produces and maintains multiple forms of oppression, to ensure that new sites of extraction can be constantly identified and exploited in the endless pursuit of capital accumulation.” Awais Aftab has said that Chapman's work “has had a substantial impact on my own thinking, and their writings have consistently forced me, and many others, to rethink long-standing assumptions related to pathology and medical care.” Julie Dind stated in a review of the book Neurodiversity Studies: A New Critical Paradigm, which included Chapman's writings, that one of their essays successfully challenges the tragic perspective on autism promoted by medicine. In 2023, Tiago Abreu argued that Chapman's work manages to provide an effective state-of-the-art and historical contextualization of neurodiversity.\n\n\n=== Psychiatry ===\nIn various articles and especially in their book Empire of Normality: Neurodiversity and Capitalism, Chapman has criticized how psychiatrists and the field of psychiatry deal with the issue of mental health and disability. In 2022, Chapman said that “a lot of critical psychiatry today is about emphasizing how people with mental health diagnoses are not 'really' disabled–not like 'really' disabled people–because mental health is a political issue rather than a medical issue. For me, however, all issues concerning health and disability are political issues; so, that is a false binary\".\nChapman has also criticized anti-psychiatry, especially the work of Thomas Szasz. John Cromby, for Mad in the UK, responded critically to Chapman's approach in Empire of Normality, arguing that the work “misrepresents antipsychiatry” in terms of historical context and use of the term, and argued that it “tends towards idealism.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "American-born Filipino actress Liza Soberano has received many accolades for her work in film and television. She began her career as a teenager with a minor role in a 2011 episode of the fantasy anthology series Wansapanataym, followed by a supporting part in the drama series Kung Ako'y Iiwan Mo, for which she was nominated for a Star Award for Best Female New TV Personality. For much of 2013, she played minor roles in films—the coming-of-age romantic comedy Must Be... Love and the comedy-drama She's the One. Soberano had her breakthrough role in the second season of the drama series Got to Believe (2014). She played the love interest of Daniel Padilla's character, alongside Kathryn Bernardo.\nIn 2014, Soberano landed her first major role, opposite Enrique Gil, in the romantic drama series Forevermore, for which she received the award for Most Promising Female Star at 2015 Box Office Entertainment Awards. Her profile increased with two roles in commercially successful romantic comedies of 2015 which co-starred Gil. She played an unattractive exchange student in Just the Way You Are, and a woman conflicted of her feelings between two men in Everyday I Love You. Her role as an adventurous young aristocrat in the drama series Dolce Amore (2016) garnered Soberano a nomination for the Star Award for Best Drama Actress. Critical success followed with her performance of a weblog writer on a job assignment with an ex-boyfriend in Cathy Garcia-Molina's drama My Ex and Whys (2017). It became her highest-grossing release, and earned her the Box Office Entertainment Award for Box Office Queen. That same year, she took on the role of Miss Universe 2015 winner Pia Wurtzbach in a biographical episode of the anthology series Maalaala Mo Kaya.\nFor her portrayal of a tribal heroine in the epic fantasy series Bagani (2018), Soberano was nominated for a Star Award for Best Drama Actress. She then starred in Antoinette Jadaone's drama Alone/Together, which earned her two wins at the 2020 Box Office Entertainment Awards—Princess of Philippine Movies and Television and Most Popular Loveteam for Movies. Later that year, she starred as a struggling migrant worker in Dubrovnik in the romantic drama series Make It with You (2020). She also voiced the titular protagonist in the Netflix animated series Trese (2021), about a detective who deals with crimes of supernatural origin In 2024, Soberano made her Hollywood debut in Zelda Williams's comedy horror Lisa Frankenstein.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Music video ==\n\n\n== Podcast ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiza Soberano at IMDb",

        "content": "Robert C. Givins (1845/46-1915) was a Canadian-born American real estate developer and novelist. He built the Givins Beverly Castle in Beverly, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRobert C. Givins was born in Ontario, Canada in 1845 or 1846. He was the third son of the Rev. Saltern Givins, who for many years was the rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Toronto.\nWhen seventeen years old, having completed his college course, Givins came to Chicago with a capital of ten cents. He soon secured a situation in the real estate office of C. J. Hull, a noted real estate dealer at that time, and from whom Givins learned his first lesson in subdividing property. He entered the Union College of Law (now, Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law) in 1865 and graduated from that institution in 1867.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nHe was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Illinois in 1868, but never took much interest in the profession, having turned his attention to real estate. He inaugurated the system of selling lots to the working people on small monthly payments. The first subdivision ever sold out entirely by this method is situated on the northwest corner of 12th street, and what is now called Central Park Avenue. The plat was placed on record by Givins & Gilbert in 1867. He early formed a partnership with James Gilbert, later sheriff of Cook County, and engaged in the real estate business under the name of Gilbert & Givins. In 1875, Givins became associated with Edmund A. Cummings and Silas M. Moore in the firm of E. A. Cummings & Co., and continued a member of that firm from that time.\nHe was the founder of many suburban towns about Chicago, several of which were later embraced within the Chicago city limits. During his business career, he sold out building lots sufficient to make a city of vast proportions.\nHe was fond of writing stories. Three of his novels, The Rich Man's Fool, The Millionaire Tramp, The Unwritten Will, were well known books of fiction, and were read throughout the U.S. and other countries. Other novels included Mlle. L'Inconneue, Jones Abroad and One thousand miles an hour. His letters, written to the Chicago Evening Post while on a trip around the world, proved highly entertaining.\nGivins was one of the organizers and a charter member of the Chicago real estate board, of which organization he was vice president in 1894.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn later years, he devoted much time to traveling, and was engaged with his wife, Emma S. Givins, in making a tour of the world and securing souvenirs and works of art from other countries for their home at Tracy Heights.\nTheir home, built of rock-faced limestone, on a high ridge, with commanding towers, was an imitation of a feudal castle, and a picturesque residence.\nHe had one son, Robert S. Givins.\nRobert C. Givins died in San Francisco, California, April 14, 1915.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nThe Rich Man's Fool\nThe Millionaire Tramp\nThe Unwritten Will\nMlle. L'Inconneue\nJones Abroad\nOne thousand miles an hour\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fang Gan (方干; 809–888), also known as Fang Xiongfei (雄飞) and Xuanying (玄英), was a Tang dynasty poet.\nFang's father, Fang Su (方肅), was a jinshi and Hangzhou-based magistrate who founded the Fang Clan of White Cloud (白雲方氏) in White Cloud Village, Tonglu, Zhejiang. According to the tenth-century Jianjie lu (鑑誡錄) or Records of Warnings, Fang Gan was the fourteenth son of his family. He was nicknamed \"Fang Sanbai\" (方三拜, literally \"Fang Three Bows\") because of his idiosyncrasy of bowing three times to whomever he met. Despite being academically gifted, he failed the imperial examination more than ten times, apparently because of his cleft lip which examiners felt would bring Chinese academia into disrepute.\nFang successfully underwent surgery for his cleft lip about a decade after retiring to Jinghu. According to a poem by Song dynasty poet Xu Tianyou (徐天佑), titled \"Fan Gan Dao\" (方幹島) or \"Fan Gan's Island\", this operation took place around 880. Now referred to as \"Buchun Xiansheng\" (補唇先生) or \"Mr Lip Mended\", Fang spent his final years in a local mountain retreat. Fang was a noted player of the guqin, and enjoyed fishing and drinking in his spare time.\nFang wrote countless poems in his lifetime, three hundred and seventy of which were preserved by one of his proteges and subsequently published in a ten-juan anthology by Wang Zan (王贊). Following a popular campaign against \"Qu mingru\" (屈名儒) or \"injustice to noted scholars\", Fang was posthumously recognised as a successful imperial candidate. A Chinese proverb about posthumous recognition thus goes, \"Shenhou shi Fang Gan\" (身後識方干) or \"Not until after his death was Fan Gan recognised\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===",

        "content": "Burnsall Bridge is a historic bridge across the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire, in England.\nA bridge across the river at Burnsall was in existence early by the 14th century.  It was repaired in 1609 at the expense of William Craven, and again repaired in 1659, at a cost of £300.  It was brought down during a flood in the summer of 1673, which destroyed many other bridges on the river.  The bridge was reconstructed, with funding from a charge levied across the West Riding of Yorkshire.  The bridge was again severely damaged in a flood in 1883, a reconstructed bridge opening in 1885.  It has been grade II listed since 1954.  It is a much-photographed location, on a picturesque section of the river, and is crossed by the Dales Way.\nThe narrow stone bridge is slightly hump-backed.  It carries the B6160 road over the River Wharfe, and consists of five segmental arches, the outer arches smaller.  It has triangular cutwaters rising to pedestrian refuges, a band, a parapet and end pilasters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burnsall\n\n\n== References ==",

This compound was ultimately first synthesised by Geoffrey Varty and colleagues at Irish biopharmaceutical company Cybin in 2023. It has a Ki of 0.35 nM at 5-HT2A, and an EC50 of 4.1 nM at 5-HT2A and 7.3 nM at 5-HT2C, compared to 88 nM at 5-HT2B. It is a potent, selective, long acting and orally active agonist for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and produces psychedelic-like responding in several different animal species. It is not known to have been tested in humans.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2C (psychedelics)\n2C-T-28\n2C-TFM\n2C-TFE\n3C-DFE\nDOPF\nTrifluoromescaline\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 177th Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army south of Leningrad in March 1941, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939. As Army Group North advanced on Leningrad the division, still incomplete, was rushed south to the Luga area. In mid-July it helped provide the initial resistance to the LVI Motorized Corps which set up the counterstroke at Soltsy, the first significant check of the German drive on Leningrad. In August the German offensive was intensified and the defenders of Luga were encircled and forced to escape northward, losing heavily in the process. A remnant of the 177th reached Leningrad, where it received enough replacements to again be marginally combat-effective. In October to was moved to the Neva River line as part of the Eastern Sector Operational Group. After briefly coming under command of 55th Army it was moved across Lake Ladoga to join 54th Army. It remained in this Army, as part of Volkhov Front, almost continuously until early 1944, serving west of the Volkhov River. It took part in the winter offensive that finally drove Army Group North away from Leningrad and earned a battle honor for the liberation of Lyuban, where part of it had been raised in 1941. Following this victory it was reassigned to 2nd Shock Army in Leningrad Front, and took part in the unsuccessful efforts to retake the city of Narva, before being removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in April for further rebuilding and replenishment. It returned to the fighting front at the beginning of May in 21st Army facing Finland. At the outset of the final offensive against Finland it was in 23rd Army in the Karelian Isthmus. During this operation it advanced through the central part of the isthmus against determined Finnish resistance. The division remained facing Finland until early 1945, when it was moved to Latvia and spent the remainder of the war containing the German forces trapped in Courland, eventually assisting in clearing the region after the German surrender in May. It was moved to the Gorkii Military District in August, and was disbanded there in April 1946.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe division was formed in March 1941 south of Leningrad. At the start of the German invasion it was still trying to complete its formation under direct command of Leningrad Military District. Its order of battle on June 22, 1941, was as follows:\n\n483rd Rifle Regiment\n486th Rifle Regiment\n502nd Rifle Regiment\n706th Artillery Regiment\n6th Antitank Battalion (until July 1, 1943)\n7th Antitank Battalion (after July 1, 1943)\n254th Reconnaissance Company (later 254th Reconnaissance Battalion)\n333rd Sapper Battalion\n555th Signal Battalion (later 745th Signal Company)\n20th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n175th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Platoon\n243rd Motor Transport Company\n265th Field Bakery\n150th Divisional Veterinary Hospital\n29018th Field Postal Station (later 676th)\n520th Field Office of the State Bank\nCol. Ivan Stepanovich Ugryumov was assigned to command on March 24, but he was superseded on May 5 by Col. Andrei Fyodorovich Mashoshin. On May 25 the commander of Leningrad District, Lt. Gen. M. M. Popov, and his staff, had drafted a defense plan under which the 177th, along with the 191st and 70th Rifle Divisions, plus the 3rd Tank and 163rd Motorized Divisions of 1st Mechanized Corps, would remain under his direct command as a strategic reserve. Popov's plan was flawed by the assumption that the main threat to the city would come from Finland, and little was done to prepare for a German drive from the south. It was not until June 23 that Popov dispatched a deputy, Lt. Gen. K. P. Piadyshev, in that direction. This officer soon recommended that a line be established from Kingisepp to Luga to Lake Ilmen. However, severe shortages of materiel and manpower prevented any immediate action.\n\n\n== Defense of Leningrad ==\nAfter its breakneck advance through the Baltic states, Army Group North began moving again early on July 9 from the Pskov and Ostrov regions. It was now 250km from Leningrad. In anticipation, on July 4 Army Gen. G. K. Zhukov ordered Popov to \"immediately occupy a defense line along the Narva–Luga–Staraya Russa–Borovichi front.\" Popov officially formed the Luga Operational Group on July 6, and as of July 10 it consisted of the 191st and 177th Divisions as well as the 1st Narodnoe Opolcheniye Division and four machine gun-artillery battalions.\nBy July 14 the Group had been considerably reinforced with the 41st Rifle Corps, 1st Mountain Rifle Brigade, two more Opolcheniye divisions, and other forces. Popov also placed the two tank divisions of 10th Mechanized Corps in Front reserve to provide armor support. The construction of the actual defense line had begun on June 29, using construction workers and civilians from Leningrad, although when the 177th arrived south of Luga itself on July 4 it was so incomplete that an additional 25,000 labourers had to mobilized. The 191st Division occupied the Kingisepp sector of the line. Meanwhile, the German advance from Pskov, while slower than through the Baltics due to rugged terrain and summer heat, was still gaining some 25km per day. The 111th Rifle Division, which had already taken heavy losses in fighting east of Pskov, fell back to support the 177th south of Luga. As the LVI Motorized Corps, under command of Gen. E. von Manstein, and backed by infantry of I Army Corps, advanced on the Novgorod axis it encountered unexpectedly stiff resistance.\n\n\n=== Counterstroke at Soltsy ===\nThe 8th Panzer Division, in the vanguard, penetrated 30-40km along the Shimsk road and reached the town of Soltsy late on July 13. Here it was halted by spirited opposition from the 177th and the 10th Mechanized, skilfully exploiting the difficult terrain. By nightfall the panzers found themselves isolated from the 3rd Motorized Division to its left and the 3rd SS Totenkopf Division lagging in the rear.\n\nAlert for opportunities to strike back, the STAVKA ordered a counterstroke against the overexposed German force. This was communicated to Marshal K. Ye. Voroshilov, who in turn directed 11th Army to attack along the Soltsy-Dno axis with two shock groups. The northern group consisted of the 10th Mechanized's 21st Tank Division and the two divisions of 16th Rifle Corps, with reinforcements. The southern group consisted of the three divisions of the 22nd Rifle Corps, and was to attack 8th Panzer from the east, with one division moving against the panzers' communication lines to the southwest. The assault, launched in oppressive 32 degree C summer heat and massive clouds of dust, caught 8th Panzer and 3rd Motorized totally by surprise. The two divisions were soon isolated from one another and 8th Panzer was forced to fight a costly battle in encirclement for four days. It also disrupted the German offensive plans by forcing 4th Panzer Group to divert 3rd SS from the Kingisepp and Luga axes to rescue the beleaguered panzer division. In his memoirs von Manstein wrote:Our corps' position at that moment was hardly an enviable one, and we could not help wondering whether we had taken rather too great a risk this time... As matters stood, the only course open to us was to pull 8 Panzer Division back through [S]oltsy to escape the encirclement that now threatened... The next days proved critical, with the enemy straining every nerve to keep up his encirclement and throwing in, besides his rifle divisions, two armoured divisions enjoying strong artillery and air support. 8 Panzer Division nevertheless managed to break through [S]oltsy to the west and re-group, despite having to be temporarily supplied from the air.The Soltsy counterstroke cost 8th Panzer 70 of its 150 tanks destroyed or damaged and represented the first, albeit temporary, success achieved by Soviet forces on the path to Leningrad. It also cost the German command a precious week to regroup and resume the advance. However, the cost to the Soviet forces was high.\nIn response to a letter from the STAVKA dated July 15, Popov split the Luga Group into three separate and semi-independent sector commands on July 23, in addition to relieving and arresting Piadyshev for \"dereliction of duty\". The Luga Sector, under command of Maj. Gen. A. N. Astinin, was tasked with holding the Luga highway axis south of Leningrad. He was assigned the 177th, 111th, and 235th Rifle Divisions, 2nd Tank Division, the 1st Regiment of 3rd Narodnoe Opolcheniye Division, two machine gun - artillery battalions, and a battalion from the Leningrad Artillery School. At the same time Voroshilov's headquarters inspected the Luga Defense Line and determined it was utterly inadequate. It was recommended that further defenses be constructed closer to Leningrad, despite Voroshilov's objections, which were overruled by Stalin. By the beginning of August the 177th, 111th and 235th had come under command of 41st Rifle Corps, still in the Luga Group.\n\n\n=== Retreat to Leningrad ===\nOn August 8 Hitler ordered that Army Group North be reinforced with large armored forces and air support in preparation for a final drive on the city. Two days later elements of LVI Motorized, supported by I and XXVIII Army Corps, advanced along the Luga and Novgorod axes toward the southern and southwestern approaches to Leningrad. The three Corps tore into and through the partially prepared defenses of the Luga Group and advanced on Krasnogvardeysk, while the 48th Army was forced out of Chudova and Tosno. These advances cut the line of communications to the Luga Group, which had to give up the town August 20. Fighting in encirclement, the nine Soviet divisions, including the 177th, had to cut their way out to the north and east in small parties, harried continually by the 8th Panzer, 4th SS, 269th and 96th Infantry Divisions conducting ongoing converging attacks on the Group from all sides. The German command estimated Red Army losses at 30,000 men, 120 tanks and 400 guns among the encircled forces.\nAs of September 1 the 235th was still in 41st Corps which was assigned to the Southern Operational Group of Leningrad Front, which had been formed on August 27 from part of Northern Front. Remnants of the division took up positions near Pushkin, but by now the combined strength of the 235th, 177th Rifle and 24th Tank Divisions was no more than 2,000 men. On September 8 elements of Army Group North captured Shlisselburg, completing the land blockade of Leningrad. Under the circumstances the 235th would be disbanded as part of an effort to rebuild the 177th over the next four weeks. On October 10, Colonel Mashoshin left the division to take command of the 115th Rifle Division; he would lead three other divisions during the war and gained the rank of major general on September 25, 1943. He was replaced by Col. Grigorii Ivanovich Vekhin, who had been serving as acting commander of 70th Rifle Division.\n\n\n=== First Sinyavino Offensive ===\nIn early October the 177th was assigned to the Eastern Sector Operational Group, formed by Maj. Gen. I. I. Fedyuninskii, the commander of Leningrad Front, from 55th Army and Front reserves. This Group consisted of five rifle divisions, two tank brigades and one battalion, and supporting artillery. It was intended to assault across the Neva River on a 5km-wide sector between Peski and Nevskaya Dubrovka, advance toward Sinyavino, and help encircle and destroy the German forces south of Shlisselburg in conjunction with 54th Army advancing from the east, effectively lifting the siege. German action preempted the Soviet attack, as they began a thrust toward Tikhvin on October 16. Nevertheless, the STAVKA insisted that the attack proceed as planned on October 20, but it made little progress. By October 23, Tikhvin was directly threatened, and the STAVKA lost its nerve. Fedyuninskii was moved to command of 54th Army, Lt. Gen. M. S. Khozin, took over Leningrad Front, and the Sinyavino offensive was officially cancelled on October 28.\n\n\n=== Tikhvin Counteroffensive ===\nTikhvin fell on November 8 to 12th Panzer Division, but it had been weakened by Soviet resistance, was vastly overextended, surrounded on three sides, and subject to minus 40 degree C. temperatures. Despite this, Hitler refused to sanction any retreat. The STAVKA now prepared for a wide-reaching counteroffensive, to involve 17 rifle divisions, two tank divisions, and one cavalry division. The series of attacks began on November 12. Previous to this the forces of Leningrad Front had been ordered to support the operations east of the Volkhov River. Khozin launched an attack on November 2 from the bridgehead at Moskovskaya Dubrova against the 96th Infantry but made little impression at the cost of heavy casualties. Supporting KV tanks had been unable to cross the river due to heavy losses of bridging equipment. A second attempt was set for overnight on November 9, now also targeting the 227th Infantry Division. A special shock group had been formed from select Narodnoe Opolcheniye volunteers backed by the 177th and went into action on November 11 along an axis toward the Gorodok No. 1 settlement, which had been turned into a strongpoint. The attack faltered after gaining a small lodgement on the western edge of the settlement.\nOn December 7 the German forces were still in Tikhvin, but the counteroffensive west of Moscow by Western Front had begun two days earlier, which rendered Hitler's notions of continuing an advance from the town utterly futile. At 0200 hours on December 8 he finally authorized a withdrawal, which, in fact, had been underway for several hours. The retaking of Tikhvin, in the event, would prove to be one of the first permanent liberations of Soviet territory during the war, and probably saved Leningrad. By the end of the month Army Group North had been driven back roughly to the line of the Volkhov. Also during December the 177th came under direct command of 55th Army, and on December 18 Colonel Vekhin left the division; he would soon be given command of the 152nd Rifle Division and would end the war leading the 350th Rifle Division, becoming a Hero of the Soviet Union on May 29, 1945. He was replaced by Col. Anatolii Gavrilovich Koziev, who had previously led the artillery group of 42nd Army.\n\n\n=== Move to Volkhov Front ===\nIn January 1942 the division left Leningrad via the Road of Life over Lake Ladoga to join 54th Army, which was still in Leningrad Front. With one brief interruption it was in this Army until February 1944, part of Volkhov Front. 54th Army controlled the Lake's southern shore.\n\n\n== Lyuban Offensive Operation ==\n\nHaving liberated the territory occupied by the Germans in their Tikhvin offensive and caused them significant casualties, Stalin expected his armies to be able to break the siege of Leningrad, as part of a series of offensives across the front. Army Gen. K. A. Meretskov of Volkhov Front wrote:\"The 4th Army on the right flank was supposed to attack in the general direction of Kirishi and Tosno to encircle and destroy the enemy that had advanced north of Mga to Lake Ladoga in cooperation with the Leningrad Front's 54th Army.\" The new offensive had been launched by 54th Army on January 4, when it once again attacked I Corps, to the west of Kirishi. Forty-eight hours of heavy fighting produced an advance of only 4–5km, after which a counterattack by 12th Panzer Division drove the Army's troops back to their starting line. The attack was renewed on January 13 and the village of Pogoste was taken on the 17th, but that was the limit of success.\nBy mid-February 2nd Shock Army of Volkhov Front had driven across that river and was forcing its way through the swamps towards Lyuban, well in the German rear, but was unable to break out decisively toward Leningrad. On February 26, Leningrad Front received the following:\"The STAVKA of the Supreme High Command orders: after the 54th Army's shock group has been reinforced on 26–27 February, the 54th Army will launch a decisive offensive in the general direction of Lyuban no later than 1 March. By combining the 54th Army's attack with an attack by the Volkhov Front's forces, the fronts' united forces will completely liquidate the enemy's Lyuban – Chudovo grouping and capture the Lyuban–Chudovo rail line.\"Reinforcement of 54th Army with the 4th Guards Rifle Corps made it possible to penetrate the German defenses near Pogoste on March 15, driving 22km southwards to within 10km of Lyuban, but German re-deployments brought the advance to a halt by March 31. The 177th was not heavily involved in this operation, holding the line on quieter sectors. During March it was transferred to 8th Army, still in Leningrad Front, but returned to the 54th in April. The 54th Army, while liberating some territory, was not successful in linking up with 2nd Shock Army, and the latter army was cut off and destroyed during the following months.\n\n\n=== Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda ===\n54th Army was engaged in mostly local fighting through the balance of 1942. It became part of Volkhov Front when it was formed in June. The 177th was kept at a fairly low strength level on this defensive front. On January 12, 1943, Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts launched Operation Iskra, which by the end of the month had finally opened a land corridor to the besieged city, but this also did not directly involve the 54th. However, the success of Iskra, as well as the encirclement and destruction of German 6th Army at Stalingrad and the subsequent offensives in the south, led the STAVKA to plan a larger operation near Leningrad, to be called Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Pole Star), with the objective of the complete destruction of Army Group North.\nThe objective of 54th Army was to create a shallow encirclement, in conjunction with 55th Army from Leningrad, of the German forces still holding the Sinyavino – Mga area. The Army was to attack north of the village of Smerdynia in the direction of Tosno where it would meet the 55th; it would then attack towards Lyuban to divert the attention of German 18th Army from the deep encirclement being planned by Northwestern Front once its forces captured the Demyansk salient and its defenders. The 54th was reinforced before the offensive, which it began on February 10. It attacked the 96th Infantry with four rifle divisions (not including the 177th), three rifle brigades, and the 124th Tank Brigade, and yet only managed to penetrate 3–4km on a 5km front in three days of heavy fighting. On February 27, STAVKA ordered Pole Star halted, as almost no progress had been made on any sector.\n\n\n== Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive ==\nThe front went back to relative inactivity for the remainder of 1943. At the beginning of October, after nearly two years of intermittent pressure, Army Group North evacuated the Kirishi salient to free up desperately needed reserves. In spite of this, the Army Group was in a very precarious position as the northern Soviet Fronts began planning a winter offensive. The plan that was issued to the commander of 54th Army between October and December must have looked familiar: a drive westwards towards Tosno, Lyuban and Chudovo as part of a short encirclement, followed by an advance southwest to Luga. However, in the past year the German forces had grown weaker, the Soviets stronger, and the offensive would be launched on three attack axes. On December 18 Colonel Koziev was transferred to command of the 256th Rifle Division where he would remain for the duration, being made a Hero of the Soviet Union on February 21, 1944 and promoted to the rank of major general on June 3. He was replaced by Col. Aleksei Yakovlevich Tzygankov, who had previously led the 1st Mountain Rifle Brigade.\n\nThe offensive on first two of the attack axes, from Leningrad itself and from the Oranienbaum bridgehead, began on January 14. 54th Army launched the third prong on the 16th:\"The enemy, who has to defend simultaneously along several directions, was subjected to yet another assault – the Volkhov Front's 54th Army went over to the attack. The direction of the attack is toward Liuban'. However, the enemy's resistance still has not been overcome. He is continuing to cling fiercely to every clump of ground and launching counterattacks. It is requiring considerable bravery and selflessness to overcome him.\"Although the attack had only advanced 5km by January 20, it was preventing German XXXVIII Army Corps from transferring forces to even harder-pressed sectors. In response to increased German resistance the 119th Rifle Corps was assigned to 54th Army, which resumed its advance overnight on January 25/26, captured Tosno and Ushaki, and reached the rail line southeast of Lyuban. The next day the commander of German 18th Army ordered his 121st Infantry Division, along with the Spanish Legion, to abandon the town, which was enveloped on three sides, and fall back to Luga. Fearing full encirclement after the loss of Lyuban and Chudovo the XXVIII Corps accelerated toward Luga, with 54th Army in pursuit. On January 28 the division received a battle honor:LYUBAN... 177th Rifle Division (Colonel Tzygankov, Aleksei Yakovlevich)... The troops who participated in the liberation of Tosno and Lyuban, by the order of the Supreme High Command of 28 January 1944, and a commendation in Moscow, are given a salute of 12 artillery salvos from 124 guns.At the beginning of February the division was under direct command of Volkhov Front, but by a month later it had joined 124th Rifle Corps of 2nd Shock Army, which was facing the German positions at Narva.\n\n\n=== First Battle for Narva ===\n2nd Shock, now under command of General Fedyuninskii, had initially made good progress toward Narva. Kingisepp had been liberated on February 1, and bridgeheads across the Narva River had been forced both north and south of the city by February 3. Beginning on February 11, Fedyuninskii's forces attacked the left wing forces of 18th Army in an effort to outflank the Panther Line from the north and to advance into Estonia. While the advance from the southern bridgehead gained up to 12km by mid-month it then came to a standstill. The STAVKA issued a directive to the commander of Leningrad Front, Army Gen. L. A. Govorov, late on February 14 demanding that Narva be taken no later than February 17. The 124th Corps had already been sent to 2nd Shock from Front reserves and it was duly deployed into the southern bridgehead, along with additional armor. Despite heavy fighting and consequent casualties on both sides by February 28 it was clear that the offensive had failed. The next day Colonel Tzygankov left the 177th, being replaced by Col. Vasilii Mikhailovich Rzhanov. This officer would be promoted to the rank of major general on April 20, 1945 and would lead the division into the postwar.\n\n\n== Continuation War ==\nDuring March the 124th Corps returned to Leningrad Front reserves, and on April 6 entered the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding, being assigned to 21st Army on April 10. While the Leningrad–Novgorod offensive had driven Army Group North from the gates of Leningrad, Finland continued to hold the part of the Karelian Isthmus that it had retaken in 1941. The STAVKA, now with an abundance of resources, set a priority on defeating the Finnish forces in Karelia, reoccupying the territory taken after the Winter War, possibly occupying Helsinki, but in any case driving Finland out of the war. The USSR officially published its peace terms on February 28, but these were rejected on March 8. Although negotiations continued, the STAVKA began planning for operations in May.\nAt this time the line from Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland was held by 23rd Army. It faced the six infantry and one armored divisions of the Finnish III and IV Army Corps, a total of roughly 250,000 personnel. 23rd Army had numerical superiority, especially in equipment, but also faced heavy fortifications and difficult terrain. In order to provide General Govorov with an overwhelming force to guarantee success, on April 28 the headquarters of 21st Army, under Lt. Gen. D. N. Gusev, arrived from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, soon followed by the men and equipment of his 124th and 97th Rifle Corps. By this time 124th Corps comprised the 177th, 281st, and 286th Rifle Divisions. During May the 177th and 281st were transferred to 23rd Army, joining the 372nd Rifle Division in 98th Rifle Corps.\n\n\n=== Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive ===\nAt the outset of the offensive the 177th and 281st Divisions were deployed in the second echelon of 23rd Army, in the eastern half of the Karelian Isthmus. In the plan for the offensive the entire 98th Corps, under command of Maj. Gen. A. I. Anisimov, would be handed over to join battle in the sector of 21st Army's right flank.\n\nOn the evening of June 9 the first echelon rifle corps of 21st Army fired a 15-minute artillery preparation, followed by a reconnaissance-in-force to assess the damage. The offensive proper by this Army began at 0820 hours on June 10, following a 140-minute artillery onslaught. The 30th Guards Rifle Corps gained up to 15km against the 10th Infantry Division, while 97th Corps only managed to advance 5km. Meanwhile, the Finns were ordered to pull back to their second line. For the next day, 97th Corps was ordered to continue to advance on Kallelovo, and 98th Corps joined the offensive in the early morning, striking at the junction between 30th Guards and 97th Corps, which was handed over to 23rd Army at 1500 hours. By day's end the 97th and 98th Corps reached the Termolovo-Khirelia line. On June 12, 98th Corps advanced northward on the road to Siiranmiaki, but the pace of the advance was slowing, and it became clear that a regrouping would be necessary before tackling that second line.\n\nBetween June 14–17 the two Soviet armies penetrated the second Finnish defense line and began a pursuit towards the third. This began with a 55-minute artillery preparation on the 23rd Army sector and the Army went over to the attack at 1000 hours along the Keksholm axis. On the left flank the 98th Corps, with two divisions of 115th Rifle Corps, attacked the defenses of 2nd and 15th Infantry Divisions in the sector of Lake Lembalovskoe and Kholttila. This force managed to capture the strongpoints of Vekhmainen and Siiranmiaki, 500-600m into the second Finnish defensive belt, by the end of the day. The attacks continued during June 16-17, but Finnish resistance increased with the commitment of scant reserves. 23rd Army slowed to a crawl in dense terrain where the Finns carried out skilful rearguard actions, and 98th Corps was completely stymied in attacks on many strongpoints in the second defensive belt. Govorov's orders on the afternoon of June 17 stated in part:The 23rd Army will pursue the Finns energetically along its entire front, prevent him from withdrawing to the Vuoksi water system, and seize positions along the southern shores of Lakes Suvanto-iarvi, Vuoksi-iarvi, and Iaiuriapian-iarvi to Muola[a] no later than 18 June... regroup the 98th Rifle Corps to the left flank, and prepare to attack northwest toward Repola to envelop Vyborg from the northeast.He also ordered both armies to create strong forward detachments reinforced with tanks and artillery. During the day the Army regained its momentum as the Finns fell back to the VTK line, advancing 5-10km on a 30km-wide sector against heavy resistance; 98th Corps reached the line from Iulentelia to Kakhkala to Tarpila. Despite these successes, both Govorov and the STAVKA considered that the advance was far too slow.\n23rd Army was now reinforced with 6th Rifle Corps, and fought all day on June 18 to pierce the VTK line. By dusk it had gained 15-20km, reaching a line from the mouth of the Taipalen-ioki River on Lake Ladoga to Marianiemi and as far as Kaurula. The next day, 21st Army tore a huge gap in the defenses from Muolaa to the Gulf of Finland and began racing toward Vyborg. By now the depleted 2nd and 15th Infantry Divisions, reinforced by 19th Infantry Brigade, were trying to hold sectors up to 50km wide. Overnight on June 19/20, Govorov ordered the two armies to \"destroy the enemy Vyborg grouping and capture Vyborg no later than 20 June by developing the attack to the northwest.\" 23rd Army was to attack from the line Kiuliapakkola–Kheinioki with the 6th and 98th Corps to reach a line from Kavantsaari Station to Kukauppi no later than June 21. At the same time the 177th was transferred to 6th Corps, and it captured the Saren Peninsula on June 27 before going over to the defense. On July 10 it returned to 98th Corps, which was now part of 21st Army. During the offensive the division suffered 1,177 fatal casualties, of which 95 were officers, and 1,082 other ranks.\n\n\n== Courland Pocket and Postwar ==\nIn September the 177th was reassigned to the 43rd Rifle Corps in 59th Army, still in Leningrad Front. In November it returned to 23rd Army as part of 97th Corps, which also contained the 178th and 327th Rifle Divisions. It would remain under these commands until the German surrender. In the spring of 1945 it moved into Latvia, eventually to the vicinity of Liepāja. On the evening of May 9, Army Group Courland surrendered, and for most of the remainder of the month the 177th was involved in taking the surrender of German troops.\nIn August the 97th Corps was moved to the newly-formed Gorkii Military District, where the division was stationed at Ivanovo. It was disbanded there in April 1946.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFeskov, V.I.; Golikov, V.I.; Kalashnikov, K.A.; Slugin, S.A. (2013).

        "content": "Cresswell Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Cresswell in the county of Northumberland. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1875.\nThe station was closed in 1944.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the founding of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck in 1824, and later when it became the RNLI, it wasn't uncommon for any acts of gallantry at sea, whether by lifeboat, or other means, to be rewarded with the RNLI Gold or Silver Medal. For the rescue of 6 men from the vessel Julius on 23 November 1861, which was aground and breaking up on Broad Sand Rocks, Thomas Brown (Big Tom), a Cresswell boatman, was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\nSome years later, in 1874, James Brown of Cresswell, and his 3 sons, were drowned when their fishing boat overturned within sight of the shore. James was the brother of Thomas. At the inquiry, it was stated that no lifesaving equipment was available at Cresswell, nor was there a Barometer to indicate the weather.\nAn appeal was made to the RNLI for a lifeboat to be stationed at Cresswell, which was agreed. A 30-foot 8-oar self-righting pulling and sailing lifeboat (one with oars and sails) was constructed by Forrestt of Limehouse, London costing £328-18s-0d. A launching carriage cost a further £114-13s-0d. Addison John Baker-Cresswell, of Cresswell Hall, provided the site and dressed stone for the construction of a boathouse, which cost £154-11s-4d. A major benefactor was Mr Thomas Hackwood of Sydenham, who requested the boat be named Old Potter. Thomas Brown (Big Tom) was appointed Coxswain.\nA new lifeboat would be provided to Cresswell in 1889. Ellen and Eliza (ON 245), a 10-oar self-righting lifeboat, with two sails, and a water pump to remove water from the boat, arrived on 24 August 1889. Thomas Brown was still Coxswain, with no fewer than 8 other crew members with the surname Brown. Thomas retired in 1890, being awarded a Silver second-service clasp. His replacement Henry Brown served until 1893, handing over to Adam Brown, the son of Thomas.\nAdam Brown would remain Coxswain until 1908. He had been a member of the crew since 1875. His retirement would come just before a new boat was to arrive in Cresswell, a 34-foot 10-oar Dungeness-class lifeboat, designed by Felix Rubie, costing £723, funded from the legacy of Mrs M.A.Vaughan of Highbury. The boat was named Martha (ON 599). Adam would be succeeded by William Brown, another crew member since 1875.\nWilliam would be awarded the The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum for a service in 1914, and continue as Coxswain until his retirement in 1925. Robert Brown would take over for a short time in 1925, and then hand over to Addison Brown, who would serve as Coxswain until 1944.\nWith motor-powered lifeboats now at Amble to the north, and Newbiggin to the south, Cresswell Lifeboat Station was closed in 1944. The Cresswell lifeboats had launched 58 times, and saved 91 lives. Martha (ON 599) was sold out of service, being converted to be a motor yacht named Cresswell.\nThe boathouse is still in use, these days as the Cresswell Village Hall.\n\n\n== Margaret Armstrong ==\nNo mention of the Cresswell lifeboat would be complete without the mention of Margaret Armstrong (née Brown). Margaret was the daughter of James Brown, who had been lost with three of her brothers, in 1874. \nIn 1876, in heavy rain and gale force conditions, she had already helped drag the lifeboat a mile north up the beach, for the lifeboat to launch to the aid of the vessel Gustaf. With all men from Cresswell involved, Margaret, along with two younger girls, was despatched to summon the Newbiggin Rocket Brigade, running barefoot along the shortest route, a distance of 4 or 5 miles, through the swollen river Lyne, and in terrible conditions. 14 lives were saved from the Gustaf. Margaret was awarded a Silver teapot for her actions. For over 50 years, she would always respond to the Maroon (rocket) to help launch the boat, and even at the age of 70, had never missed a quarterly practice or service launch.\nMargaret was awarded the Gold Brooch, and the Institution's Record of Thanks. She was featured in a film in 1921, named by the press as 'The Second Grace Darling'.\nMargaret died in 1928 aged 79. A plaque in her memory was placed on the wall of St Bartholomew's Church, Cresswell by the RNLI in 1981.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Cresswell\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nThomas Brown, Boatman - 1861\nThomas Brown, Coxswain - 1890 (Second-Service Clasp)\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nWilliam Brown, Coxswain - 1914\n\n\n== Cresswell lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier is a biography about Stonewall Jackson, a Confederate general officer during the American Civil War. It was written by Allen Tate and published by Minton, Balch & Co. in 1928. The book takes a partisan stance for the Confederate States of America. The subtitle references the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford.\nThe book is not annotated and Tate wrote in the preface that it mainly consists of paraphrases of other published works. His main sources were Battles and Leaders of the Civil War (1884), Memoirs of Stonewall Jackson (1891) by Mary Anna Jackson, Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War (1898) by George Francis Robert Henderson and The Family and Early Life of Stonewall Jackson (1924) by Roy Bird Cook. The book was written hurriedly due to the deadline of the publishing contract. Tate was disappointed with the finished book, calling it a \"little bread-and-butter opus\". Tate said: \"I wish I could get out an injunction against the reading of it by my friends—and an injunction to compel the General Public to read it.\"\nThe scholar Max Webb wrote that the book is a portrait of Tate as well as Jackson. Steve Davis called it \"perhaps Tate's most staunchly pro-Southern work\", and wrote that this may make it incomprehensible for some Northern readers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Egbeka was the ninth Oba of Benin, ruling from 1370 AD to 1400 AD. He was the eldest son of Oba Ohen and took over the throne after his father's death.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nInformation about Oba Egbeka's early life is limited. As the eldest son of Oba Ohen, he was next in line for the throne. His ascension was preceded by a period of civil unrest and power struggles within the kingdom.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nEgbeka's reign was marked by several civil wars with the Uzama Nihinron. His governance skills were limited, and his death did not significantly affect the kingdom. During his reign, the Sobos (Urhobos) migrated from Benin, founding Abraka and other towns.\n\n\n=== Conflict with the Uneme ===\nEgbeka's rule was marked by conflict with the Uneme people, who were skilled ironmakers. He suspected them of being involved in his father's death. His actions led to the departure of the Uneme and the establishment of their community around 1390 AD. The Uneme were known for their ironmaking skills, and their departure affected the kingdom's economy and military capabilities.\n\n\n=== Military campaigns ===\nOba Egbeka's military campaigns, particularly against the Uneme people, were not successful. He attempted to subdue the Uneme by forming military alliances with neighbouring Yoruba kingdoms and using spiritual warfare.\n\n\n== Personal life, death and succession ==\nEgbeka's daughters married prominent chiefs, which helped to reduce opposition from the Uzama and brought peace during the latter part of his reign. Oba Egbeka died around 1400 AD, ending a period of unrest. The throne was succeeded by Oba Orobiru, who sought to stabilise the kingdom after Egbeka's reign.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBRADBURY, R.

        "content": "Michael Taylor (born c. 1954) is an American former college football coach. He was the head football coach for North Greenville College—now known as North Greenville University—from 1987 to 1991 and from 2004 to 2008 and Newberry College from 1992 to 2002.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nTaylor was a native of Savannah, Georgia, and was a two-sport athlete for H. V. Jenkins High School and Newberry College. He participated in football and baseball. For the football team, he was a tailback for his first two seasons as he rushed for 518 yards as a sophomore in 1973. He suffered a season-ending injury during the 1974 football season. In 1975, he transitioned to defensive back. \n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 1977, after he graduated from Newberry, he was hired as an assistant football coach for Georgetown (KY). After one season he was hired as the defensive backs coach for Lenoir–Rhyne. He coached the Bears defensive backfield for five seasons before being hired for the same position for East Tennessee State in 1983. Before the next season, he transitioned from coaching the defensive backs to coaching the wide receivers. In 1986, he rejoined Lenoir–Rhyne as the team's defensive coordinator. He resigned following the season.\nAfter only one season with Lenoir–Rhyne, Taylor was hired as the head football coach for North Greenville. He was hired to coach the start-up junior college team that announced they were reinstating the previously discontinued football program. The team started practicing in the spring of 1988 and played their first varsity season in the fall of 1988. During his three-year tenure with the junior college, he finished with an overall record of 32–3, including undefeated seasons in his first and last seasons. His teams were known for their defensive prowess and his option running game. In 1992, he was hired as the head football coach for his alma mater, Newberry. In eleven seasons as head coach he led the team to a 47–73 record including a fifteen-game South Atlantic Conference (SAC) conference game losing streak. His best season came in 1996, the teams first season back in the SAC, as he led the team to a 7–4 record. He was fired following a 1–10 record in 2002. After not coaching in 2003, Taylor rejoined North Greenville, which was now a member of the NCAA Division II. He led the team to a 22–32 record in five seasons at the helm. His best season came in 2006 when his team finished 10–2 and won the Victory Bowl. He resigned after the 2008 season.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nIn 2001, Taylor was inducted into the North Greenville Hall of Fame as a coach.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorth Greenville Hall of Fame profile",

It was brought into the state system as an elementary school in 1876, admitting both boys and girls.  It became a primary school in 1944.  It was grade II listed in 1969.  In 2002, Alan Stockdale and John Townend wrote a history of the school, with profits going towards the construction of a new extension of the building.  In 2024, the school was inspected by Ofcom and graded \"good\".  At the time, it had 50 pupils.\nThe school is in stone on a plinth, and has a stone slate roof with chamfered stone coping, ball finials, and a bellcote on the right gable.  There are two storeys and six bays.  In the third bay is a full height gabled porch containing a doorway with a moulded surround and a four-centred arch under a square head with foliated spandrels.  Above it is an inscribed and dated panel flanked by engaged columns carrying a cornice, and over it is a hood mould.  The panel reads: \"William Craven Alderman of London founder of this Schoole Anno Dmi 1601\".  The inner doorway has a chamfered surround and a four-centred arch.  All the windows have ogee mullions and leaded lights, those in the ground floor under a continuous hood mould.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005), is a Supreme Court case that determined that the burden of proof belonged to whoever challenged an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Schaffer v. Weast revised the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which had introduced IEPs as a method of ensuring an individual and effective education for disabled students. Prior to Schaffer v. Weast, when any party challenged an IEP, the burden of proof was almost always placed on the respective school system.\n\n\n== Question Raised ==\nWho is assigned the burden of proof if parents or a school system decide to legally challenge an IEP?\n\n\n== Decision ==\nOn November 14, 2005, the Supreme Court issued a 6-2 ruling in favor of Schaffer. After the case, Justice O’Connor stated that  “If parents believe their child's IEP is inappropriate, they may request an \"impartial due process hearing.\" §1415(f). The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing. We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.”\n\n\n== Background ==\nJocelyn and Martin Schaffer, parents of Brian Schaffer, sued superintendent Jetty Weast and the Montgomery County Public Schools, because the Schaffer's claimed that their child was not receiving the fair and adequate education that is afforded to all students with disabilities in the United States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (I.D.E.A.). The Schaffer family claimed that the Individualized Education Program (I.E.P.) that was created specifically for Brian – who suffers from learning disabilities and speech impairments – was not working in the best interest of their child.\nThe district court that heard the case presented by the Schaffer family, held that the Schaffer family was in the right and the school district needed to rectify the situation of providing the supports needed the ensure Brian received a fair and adequate education. When the Fourth Circuit court took the case on appeal, it ruled that the lower court (district court) had mistakenly put the burden of proof on the school system – to prove the student received an adequate and fair education – and that whoever claimed the education plan of the student was not working had to prove so.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abdelkader Zoukh is a former Algerian politician who served as the wali of Algiers from 2013 to 2019, and also as the wali of M'Sila, Aïn Témouchent, Mostaganem, Oran, and Sétif between 1991 and 2013. Zoukh was dismissed from his post as wali of Algiers due to the Hirak protest movement against the Algerian government that broke out in 2019, and was later sentenced to several years in prison for a variety of corruption cases.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZoukh was born in Ouargla, French Algeria on November 15, 1949. He graduated from the National School of Administration in 1982. His first administrative position was as the wali of M'Sila Province between August 21, 1991, and 1996. Between 1996 and August 22, 1999, he served as the wali of Aïn Témouchent , and then as wali of Mostaganem Province from 1999 to August 17, 2004. Between 2004 and August 11, 2005, Zoukh served as the wali of Oran Province, and later as wali of Médéa Province from 2005 to September 30, 2010.\nZoukh was appointed wali of Sétif Province in 2010, and remained in that position until October 24, 2013, when he was appointed the wali of Algiers Province by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. As wali of Algiers, Zoukh was accused of corruption by various Algerian authorities. Zoukh was dismissed from his post as wali of Algiers on April 22, 2019, two months into the Hirak protest movement against the Bouteflika government. His dismissal was announced just five hours after the collapse of a building in the lower Casbah that killed five people.\nZoukh was referred to the Algerian supreme court for corruption in the aftermath of Hirak on May 26, 2019. On June 6, he was officially retired via a presidential decree, and his position as wali was replaced by Abdelhalek Sayouda. On June 17, he was placed under judicial supervision due to several corruption cases made against him. On December 5, 2020, Zoukh was sentenced to five years in prison due to granting privileges to the family of prominent Algerian general Abdelghani Hamel, and another four years in prison for a similar case involving Mahieddine Tahkout's family. Zoukh was sentenced to another four years in prison on December 29, 2020, due to his abuse of office in favor of Ali Haddad.\nIn a new trial in December 2021, Zoukh's prison sentence in the case regarding Hamel was reduced to one year, the case involving Haddad was reduced to three years, and the case involving Tahkout was reduced to three years. On May 5, 2022, Zoukh was sentenced to two more years in prison for a corruption case involving Zoukh granting privileges to the company Ennahar. On January 26, 2023, Zoukh was sentenced to three more years in prison and forced to pay a fine of 200,000 Algerian dinars over abusing his office to aid the son of General Belksir.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Foundation of Coubertin is a French foundation that aims to perfect the professional, intellectual and cultural training of young people from manual trades and to transmit a number of values to them: concern for perfection and quality of work, sense of honesty and responsibility.\n\n\n== The meeting of the two founders ==\nThe Foundation of Coubertin was born from the meeting in 1949 of two personalities:\n\nYvonne de Coubertin (1893–1974), the last descendant of this name with her sister Marie-Marcelle (she is the niece of Pierre de Coubertin, re-creator of the Olympic Games), owner of the estate whose grandfather Bonnaventure Julien Frédy de Coubertin was mayor of Saint-JeanRémy-lès-Chevreuse and Father Paul Frédy de Coubertin, literary author;\nJean Bernard, artist and renovator of the Companionship of Duty of the Tour of France, only child of sculptor Joseph Bernard.\nIn 1950 they created an association for the development of rural companionship. This association became in 1973 the Foundation of Coubertin, immediately recognized as a public utility.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe domain of Coubertin (80 hectares) is located in the valley of Chevreuse in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, in the countryside (although five minutes walk is enough to reach the RER station).\nThe entrance to the estate opens onto a majestic linden driveway leading to the palace gate. Behind the gate, a French driveway leads to a castle of the late seventeenth century, with a sober facade. To the right of the castle, below, is the garden of bronzes and behind the castle, an English park. The castle is listed as a historical monument by decree of 7 September 1945.\n\n\n== Mission of the Foundation of Coubertin ==\nThe purpose of the Coubertin Foundation is to perfect the professional, intellectual and cultural training of young people from manual trades and to transmit a number of values to them: concern for perfection and quality of work, sense of honesty and responsibility. Each year, the institution receives about thirty young people, belonging to the trades of carpenter, cabinetmaker, metalworker, bricklayer, stonemason, plasterer and coppersmith, mostly from the Workers' Association of Companions of Duty and Tour of France.\nProfessional training is provided in master's workshops, known as :\n\nThe Saint-Jacques workshops, for metalwork, carpentry and stone-cutting; the Saint-Jacques workshops carried out the complete reconstruction of the royal gate at the Versailles palace as it existed before 1771;\nFoundry of Coubertin, for metalwork and cast art; in 2008, the foundry realized the Flame of Liberty of Jean Cardot, realized for the Embassy of the United States in Paris and inaugurated in the presence of the United States and French presidents.\n\n\n== The collections of the Coubertin Foundation ==\n\nThe collections of the Foundation of Coubertin are located in the palace of the estate. The Foundation received from its second president, Jean Bernard, a donation of 21 sculptures and 1,500 drawings by his father, the sculptor Joseph Bernard. This donation is the beginning and the core of the collections of the Foundation of Coubertin.\nIn 1994, the workshop funds of sculptor René Collamarini (1904–1983) were added to the collections.\nThe Foundation has a set of sculptures ranging from the end of the 19th century to the 20th century (116 pieces): Robert Wlérick, Pablo Gargallo, Carlo Sarrabezolles, Jean Chauvin, Étienne Hajdu, Marta Pan, Jean Cardot as well as an important choice of sculptor drawings. The Foundation also benefits from deposits of sculptures (about sixty), including an important deposit of the Bourdelle museum and pieces by Étienne Martin, Marta Pan, Parvine Curie, Karel, Dominique Labauvie, John Kelly.\nAround this collection, the architect Robert Auzelle has set up an open-air sculpture museum, the Jardin des Bronzes.\nThe conservation of the Collections organizes an exhibition of sculpture every year and the estate opens to the public for two months.\nIn 2002, the collections of the Coubertin Foundation were awarded the label of \"Musée de France\".\n\n\n== Major exhibitions from 1986 to 2012 ==\n1986 : sculptures du xxe siècle ;\n1987 : bronzes d’automne, de Rodin à Zadkine ;\n1988 : la sculpture en taille directe en France, de 1900 à 1950 ;\n1989 : pierres et marbres de Joseph Bernard ;\n1990 : Aux grands hommes, David d’Angers ;\n1991 : genèse d’une sculpture, le monument à Michel Servet, de Joseph Bernard ;\n1992 : Jean Chauvin ;\n1993 : Étienne Hajdu ;\n1996 : Étienne Martin ;\n1998 : Gilioli ;\n1999: course of sculpture in Île-de-France (selection from the collection of the Regional Contemporary Art Fund (FRAC) of Île-de-France);\n2000: Marta Pan;\n2001: Jean Cardot;\n2002: Eugène Dodeigne;\n2005: Nicolas Alquin;\n2007: forty drawings by Joseph Bernard (exhibition at the Orangerie of Madame Élisabeth in Versailles);\n2008: Jean Bernard, artist and companion of duty, on the centenary of his birth;\n2009: sculptures by Antoine Poncet (poetic resonances with Jean Arp and Philippe Jaccottet);\n2010: sculptures by Ousmane Sow (May 8 to July 11);\n2011: a look at Rodin's photographs, videos, installations by Jean-Yves Cousseau (from May 7 to July 10, 2011);\n2012: sculptures by Denis Monfleur (from May 5 to July 22, 2012).\n\n\n== Frequentation ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMasterpiece (companionship) (on French Wikipedia)\nApprenticeship\nPierre de Coubertin\nMetalworking",

        "content": "British Columbia government debt is composed of the financial liabilities of the Canadian provincial government of British Columbia.: 81 \nAs of 2023, the British Columbia (BC) total government debt (total liabilities) was $129.3 billion for the 2022-23 fiscal year (ending 31 March 2023). Total debt consists mainly of debt securities (e.g. government-issued bonds), but includes other financial liabilities such as accounts payable.: 154  The BC government had $85.2 billion in debt securities (e.g., government bonds) outstanding in 2022.\nBritish Columbia government net debt (i.e., total debt minus financial assets) was $60.7 billion in 2022–23.: 154  Net debt per person was $11,329, and net debt as a percentage of provincial GDP was 15.4%.: 154  In its 2024 budget, the BC government forecast that its net debt would more than double in four years, rising to $128.8 billion by 2026–27.: 154  Following the budget's release, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the province's credit outlook to \"negative\", and S&P issued its second credit downgrade in a year, with both agencies highlighting the province's burgeoning debt.\nBritish Columbia became the first province in Canada to pass legislation to limit the growth in government debt in 1991. Between 2000 and 2022, BC had legislation in place to limit the growth of government debt, with the measures having been introduced by both major parties (the New Democratic Party and the BC Liberal Party).\n\n\n== Alternative measures of BC government debt ==\nThe British Columbia (BC) government focuses on its debt measured as net debt (also called net liabilities).  Its net debt is defined as its total debt minus its total financial assets, which consist chiefly of investments in commercial publicly-owned (Crown) corporations, such as BC Hydro.: 154  Another measure of BC government debt is its debt securities issued in the market (e.g. government bonds, bills, and debentures).\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish Columbia government net debt was fairly stable from 1998, but rose following the 2007–2008 financial crisis before stabilizing again. Government spending accelerated after 2017, with real per person spending rising 4.7% annually between 2017 and 2021 vs. 0.5% between 2000 and 2017. (To ensure the growth rate difference was not due to the pandemic, COVID-related expenditures were excluded.)\nColumnist Gary Mason said that when the NDP government of John Horgan was elected in 2017, it was initially concerned about maintaining sound finances since, in the 1990s, the NDP gained a reputation for being \"spend-thrifts – lefties who hadn't a clue about properly managing the province's finances\". However, when David Eby became premier in November 2022, he signalled that balanced budgets were no longer a priority and the province borrowed heavily.\nBritish Columbia's net debt was projected to increase from 15% of GDP in 2022 to 28% by 2026. BC finance minister Katrine Conroy argued the rise in debt was justified as \"We cannot afford to have a deficit of services\" and \"what would be reckless would be to make cuts in this province\". \n\n\n== Credit rating ==\nBritish Columbia's credit rating provides an indication of its debt sustainability, as it shows a rating agency's view of the province's ability to meet its financial commitments.\nBC was rated AAA by S&P Global Ratings until July 2021, when it was downgraded to AA+. The rating was cut to AA- with a negative outlook in April 2024 (the third downgrade in three years) after the provincial government increased borrowing. S&P said it might lower its rating again in the next two years if the province \"[maintained] its current fiscal trajectory\". \nCredit rating agency Fitch gave British Columbia a long-term issuer default rating of \"AAA stable\" in 2007. Fitch cut its rating to \"AAA negative\" in July 2020, then downgraded BC to \"AA+ stable\" in July 2021.\nMoody's Investors Service has rated BC at its highest rung, Aaa, from 2006, partly on the basis that provinces in Canada have support from the federal government. On 9 April 2024 Moody's cut its outlook to \"negative\" due to rising spending commitments and a \"lack of commitment to return to fiscal balance within a specified period\".\n\n\n== Legislation to limit government debt in BC ==\nBritish Columbia was the first province in Canada to limit the growth of government debt with its Taxpayer Protection Act introduced in 1991 by the Social Credit party. The act required a balanced budget on a cumulative basis over the succeeding five-year period, and spending growth was limited to the rate of average GDP growth over the previous five years.: 5  Although the NDP voted in favour of the act while in opposition, the law was repealed in 1992 by the newly-elected NDP government of Premier Mike Harcourt, which ran a series of deficits.: 8 \nIn 1994, the Harcourt government introduced a Debt Management Plan, and two successor plans, to balance the budget and limit the growth of debt.: 8–10  NDP premier Glen Clark's government passed the Balanced Budget Act in 2000, arguing \"equity demands that future generations of British Columbians not be burdened with an unsustainable level of debt\", and that BC needed to maintain its position as a low-debt province so it would have the financial flexibility to make adequate investments in health, education, social justice, and the environment.\nIn 2001, Premier Gordon Campbell's Liberal government introduced its own fiscal control act, the Balanced Budget and Ministerial Accountability Act. As with the NDP government's law, cabinet ministers would lose up to 20% of their annual salaries if budget targets were not met.: 296–297  The act was amended in 2009 to allow for two years of deficit spending, due to the fall in provincial revenues following the worldwide 2007–2008 financial crisis.: 302 \nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Premier John Horgan's NDP government introduced the Economic Stabilization Act which suspended for three years the law that prohibited deficit budgets. In 2022, the balanced-budget component of the law was abolished permanently. Finance Minister Selina Robinson said people expected their MLAs to make wise decisions based on needs, not \"so that members of the executive council can get their full pay. I think that's a terrible motivation.\" She added that the legislation \"sent the wrong message\" and could be viewed as a deterrent to fund programs and policies that affect the budget. \n\n\n== See also ==\nBalanced Budget Act (Quebec)\nCanadian public debt\nGenerations Fund, Quebec\nGovernment debt\nOntario government debt\n\n\n== References ==",

The town is near Sukhum-Babushara Airport, which was reopened in 2008. In Dranda itself there is an Orthodox cathedral from the 6th century.\n\n\n== Dranda Cathedral ==\n\nBuilt around 551 by emperor Justinian I In the Georgian Orthodox Catholicate of Abkhazia, during the Middle Ages Dranda served as the seat of bishops. During the Turkish occupation, the temple suffered great damage, but was later restored. In 1880, a monastery was established at the cathedral. After the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, the Georgian Orthodox Church was subjected to intense harassment.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 1989 Dranda had 2,673 inhabitants, this number rose to over 3,200 by 2011. This makes Dranda one of the few places in Abkhazia whose population is higher than the figure from the last Soviet census. The majority of the population consists of Armenians (51.0%) and Abkhazians (36.3%), as well as Russians (7.1%) and Georgians (3.7%). Smaller minorities include Greeks (0.7%) and Ukrainians (0.5%).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nYuri Vardimiadi (1925–1956), footballer\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The Old Town Hall is a historic building on the corner of College Road and Slack Lane in Handsworth, West Midlands, a suburb of Birmingham in England. The building, part of which is currently used as the headquarters of the Handsworth Historical Society, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned as a private house in the mid-15th century. It was designed in the medieval style, built using cruck-framed construction techniques and was completed about 1460.\nIn 1625, it was divided into three cottages, with a floor inserted in the building's hall, and the walls infilled with brick.  Part of the building accommodated the Overseer of the Parish, who was in charge of local administration and, being in an area known as \"Town End\", it became known as the Town Hall. During the early part of the 18th century the overseer was a James Underhill and he was succeeded by a Jeremiah Needham. By the 19th century, the overseer of the parish was, among other matters, responsible for the maintenance of the village green. The building was also used as a courthouse and was the local venue for hearings of the assizes.\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with steam engine manufacturing at Soho Foundry, a local board of health was formed in Handsworth in 1877. The board commissioned the Council House on Soho Road and, after it was completed two years later, the old town hall had no further role in the administration of the area. In any case, the board's successor body, Handsworth Urban District Council, which was appointed in 1894, was wound up when the area was annexed by Birmingham City Council in 1911.\nIn the 1930s, other similar cottages and barns in the area were cleared but, following a campaign by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Sir Ernest Robert Canning, in 1933, the old town hall survived, and in 1947 it was acquired by the Birmingham Archaeological Society which restored it, redivided into two, larger, cottages, and donated it to Birmingham City Council.\nIn 1973, the Handsworth Historical Society began using one of the cottages as its headquarters and as a local history museum. The other cottage continued to be rented out to a council tenant.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe cruck-framed building has brick infill between the wood, and a tiled roof.  It has a single main storey and an attic, and two entrance doors.  There are five casement windows on the ground floor, three large and two small, and four gabled dormer windows in the attic. It has been grade II listed since 1972.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Siphulopsis is a single-species fungal genus in the family Icmadophilaceae. This monotypic genus the contains the fruticose lichen species Siphulopsis queenslandica, found in Australia. This lichen was originally described by Gintaras Kantvilas in 2018. He tentatively classified it in the genus Knightiella due to morphological similarities with Knightiella eucalypti (since transferred to the genus Knightiellastrum), but molecular phylogenetics revealed it to constitute a distinct lineage.\nThe genus name Siphulopsis combines the name Siphula, referring to a similar genus, with the Greek suffix -opsis, which denotes resemblance. This naming reflects the similarity in thallus morphology between this species and those of Siphula.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe species Siphulopsis queenslandica initiates its growth as small, scale-like patches (squamulose) and soon develops into shrub-like, cushioned clumps (fruticose), typically presenting a whitish to pale ashen-grey colour. This species lacks rhizines (root-like structures for attachment). Upon examination of a cross-section of the thallus, a pseudocortex can be observed. This outer layer is about 20–30 μm thick and consists of poorly differentiated, short-celled hyphae, each approximately 5 μm wide. This layer also contains sporadically interspersed dead cells of its photosynthetic partner, a unicellular green alga. The algal cells are spherical and measure between 6 and 10 μm in diameter.\nReproductive structures known as ascomata are not observed in this species. However, it possesses pycnidia, which are small, flask-shaped structures embedded within the thallus, producing bacilliform (rod-shaped) conidia, which are involved in asexual reproduction.\nThe chemical composition of Siphulopsis queenslandica includes thamnolic acid, a secondary metabolite common in many lichen species.\nThe generic description of Siphulopsis references its fruticose thallus that contains thamnolic acid, which is somewhat similar to Siphulae Fr. but lacks rhizines and is not genetically related to this genus.\n\n\n== References ==",

Rachel Rascoe of The Austin Chronicle called it \"ruminative, less hooky, but still a recognizable play in the Austin-area singer's traditional and soul country mix\" and felt that it \"slots like an exploratory studio in-betweener among Crockett's comprehensive catalog\". Spin's Stephen Deusner concluded that \"rather than a throwback or a neo-neo-traditionalist, he just sounds like a guy singing his sad, sad songs to the huddled masses\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that while Crockett's \"approach\" may be similar to its predecessor The Man from Waco (2022), the album \"feels considerably different thanks to the troubadour swapping country for soul as the album's connective tissue\". Ben Salmon, reviewing the album for Paste, found that the album \"sounds remarkably warm and alive and real; it feels like you can step on the bass lines, put the twinkling piano notes in your pocket or reach out and touch the pedal steel guitar parts\". Glide Magazine's Jim Hynes stated that the musicians recording live to tape \"feels like a live performance\" and Crockett \"remains squarely in the front row of today's best writers\". John Amen of No Depression praised the album, writing, \"Occurring as a cross between Hank Williams, a low-key carnival announcer, and the Coen brothers’ Buster Scruggs, Crockett has perfected his craft: $10 Cowboy is a 2024 standout.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oglethorpe Club is a historic members-only society in Savannah, Georgia. Established in 1870, it is the oldest gentlemen's club in Georgia, and the seventh-oldest in the Southern United States, behind Cape Fear Club and ahead of The Athlestan Club. It is located at 450 Bull Street, immediately to the north of Forsyth Park.\nAccording to Adelaide Wilson in Historic and Picturesque Savannah (1889), the club was organized on September 21, 1875. Twelve members were present. Its first president was George S. Owens. The club's maximum membership grew to 175 when The Chatham Club closed. Membership was 350 by 2024. Women are not allowed to be members, but can attend with her husband, as long as she wears a dress.\nThe club features the Flagstone and Colonial rooms for formal events, as well as a tavern. Cell phone use inside the building is prohibited.\nIt stands directly across Bull Street from the Armstrong House, the original owner of which—George Ferguson Armstrong—was a member of The Oglethorpe Club.\nThe Oglethorpe Club is named for General James Oglethorpe, who established the Savannah colony in 1733.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nGeorge Ferguson Armstrong, businessman\nSonny Seiler, attorney\nAn \"unwritten rule\" of the club is that members' money must be old, not new (that is, if you were not born with money, you were not permitted to become a member). It is for this reason that preservationist Jim Williams was not a member. In retaliation, in 1967 Williams purchased Armstrong House across the street.\n\n\n== Building ==\n450 Bull Street, built in 1857 and also known as the Edmund Molyneux House, was designed by John S. Norris. Molyneux was consul at Savannah from 1832 to 1862. After the Civil War, the house was purchased by Henry R. Jackson.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Devin Haney vs. Ryan Garcia, billed as This One Counts, was a professional boxing match contested in the super lightweight division between the WBC super lightweight champion, Devin Haney, and former WBC interim lightweight world champion, Ryan Garcia. The bout took place on 20 April 2024 at the Barclays Center in New York.\nThe fight ended in a majority decision win for Garcia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn February 9, 2024, it was announced that Haney vs. Garcia was signed for April 20, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada for the WBC super lightweight title.\nThe title of the fight, This One Counts, is a reference to the six prior matches between Haney and Garcia in amateur boxing, with this one being their first official match in professional boxing. The last time they fought was in January 2015, the quarterfinals of the USA Youth National Championships. Their record in the amateurs stood evenly tied at 3–3.\nTwo days before the fight, Garcia agreed to a wager with Haney that Garcia would pay $500,000 for every pound over the limit should he miss weight.\nGarcia later weighed in at 143.2lbs, 3.2lbs over the championship limit, and would forfeit up to $600,000 of his purse to Haney. Garcia would not be eligible to win the title.\n\n\n== Result ==\nGarcia won the bout via majority decision. Garcia knocked down Haney in rounds 7, 10 and 11 before coming away with the victory by Majority Decision (114–110, 115–109, 112–112). Garcia outlanded Haney 106–87 in total punches and 95–45 in power punches.\n\n\n== References ==",

He also served as the governor of the Katō clan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe eldest son of Katō Yasutada. His mother was Keijuin. His legal wife was the daughter of Katō Yasutada. He had a son named Katō Taisei (second son). He held the official rank of Shosanmi, Yamashiro no Kami, and Izumo no Kami. His childhood name was Shinnosuke. He held the title of Viscount. On December 20, 1862, he succeeded his father as the head of the family due to his retirement. In June 1864, he organized a peasant gun squad called Gosogumi. In addition to this peasant army, he also acted as the new government's army with the domain soldiers. In June 1869, he became the head of the domain due to the return of the domains to the emperor. However, in July 1871, he was dismissed from his position due to the abolition of the domains. In September 1871, he moved to Tokyo and on July 8, 1884, he was granted the title of Viscount. He was later promoted to the rank of Shōsanmi. On February 23, 1913, at the age of 76, he died. His grave is located at Kaizen-ji Temple in Matsugaya, Tokyo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKatō clan\nNiiya Domain\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Daimyo\nCategory:1838 births\nCategory:1913 deaths",

The film follows Ethan Cox (Saunders), the owner of a self-driving car company, experiences cancel when his controversial Halloween costume grabs the attention of the public on social media and puts his career at risk. To mitigate the damage, he hires Dotty (Uggams), a 71-year-old snack cart vendor, as the company's new CEO.\nThe film premiered at the 2022 San Diego International Film Festival in October 2022. It was released on May 19, 2023, by Quiver Distribution.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 5 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10.\nFilm critic Avi Offer from the NYC Movie Guru gave it a negative review writing: \"Dotty & Soul has two things going for it that make it somewhat watchable. First, there's Leslie Uggams' charismatic performance. The film comes alive the most whenever she's on screen. She deserves better material, though.\" Brittany Witherspoon from the Screen Rant wrote in her review: \"It’s clichéd and predictable, but Dotty & Soul is sincere in showing how people can learn from past mistakes when given time to put in the work.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDotty & Soul at IMDb \nDotty & Soul at Rotten Tomatoes",

        "content": "Rajaouna Mountain (or Baluwa Mountain) is a peak in the Djurdjura mountain range in the Tell Atlas in Algeria, located in the Tizi Ouzou, Tizi Ouzou District, Tizi Ouzou Province of the Kabylia region of Algeria.\n\n\n== Description ==\nRajaouna Mountain is a peak in Tizi-Ouzou Province, with an altitude of 650 m (2,133 ft), overlooking the south of the city of Tizi-Ouzou, and facing Mount Hasnawa and Mount Issa Mimoun within the Djurdjura Mountains.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the French occupation of Algeria, Rajaouna Mountain was home to a Turkish fortress built 261 meters (856 feet) above sea level.\nBefore 1830, the Regency of Algiers built this castle from the Sultan's House in the Casbah of Algiers in order to monitor the Kingdom of Kuku.\nA significant part of the Kabylia region was not under the authority of the Dey in Algiers, with the Ait Abbas fortress as its command center.\nDuring the French army's invasion of Tizi Ouzou, a fierce battle was fought around this fortress in June 1845, known as the Battle of Rajaouna.\nThe Rajaouna Heights also witnessed clashes between the Algerian National Liberation Army and the French Army during the Algerian Liberation Revolution, where the Algerians had many hideouts located at this height and its foothills.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe formation of Rajaouna Mountain dates back to the Tertiary of the Cenozoic era on the geologic timescale.\nThe presence of sedimentation of sandstone, puddingstone and breccia around Baluwa Mountain has indicated that the uplift was formed during the Oligocene period.\nArchaeological and paleontological discoveries have further confirmed this geological hypothesis.\nThe site of the current Albor village lies on a solid bed of mica schist and gneiss.\nThe top of the mountain is composed of metamorphic rock, and its foothills are composed of archean-old schist and clay schist.\n\n\n== Water ==\nRajaouna Mountain has an artesian well as well as several springs.\nAfter collecting rainwater and snowmelt, the mountain's reefs supply the Sebaou Valley, which surrounds the ridge to the east, north, and west as it descends toward its estuary in Boumerdès Province.\nThese reefs from the mountain also flow into the valley of Oued Sebt.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nRajaouna Mountain can be reached via the following national roads:\n\nNational Road 12.\nNational Road 72.\nTransportation to this mountain is available through a network of public transportation:\n\nTeleferic Rajauna.\nBohinon land Station.\nBoukhalfa train station.\nTizi Ouzou train station.\nWadi Issa train station.\n\n\n== Forests ==\nThe heights of Rajaouna Mountain are surrounded by a diverse vegetation cover centered on two forests:\n\nHarouza forest.\nBaluwa Forest.\n\n\n== Villages and districts ==\nRajaouna Mountain has two main villages:\n\nRajaouna Tasht village.\nRajaouna Albor Village.\nIt also overlooks several districts of Tizi Ouzou municipality, including:\n\nBoukhalfa.\nTala Allam.\nTemizar Leghbar.\nBouhinon.\n\n\n== Religious activities ==\n\n\n=== Mosques ===\n\nThis area contains many mosques that are supervised by the Directorate of

        "content": "The Yamazaki clan (山崎氏, Yamazaki-shi),  a samurai and aristocratic clan in Japan, was a branch of the Uda Genji and the Sasaki clan and was elevated to the rank of daimyo by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Kamakura period. Initially serving as the lord of Marugame Domain in Sanuki Province during the early Edo period, they were later deprived of their domain, with a branch remaining as a lower-ranking samurai family. After the Meiji Restoration, they established the Bitchu-Nariwa Domain and were ennobled as a kazoku (baronial) family..  \nApart from this Yamazaki clan, there are numerous other Yamazaki clans with different genealogies.\n\n\n== History ==\nYamazaki Norie served under Sasaki Yoshitaka at Yamazaki Castle in Inukami District, Omi Province, giving rise to the Yamazaki name. Yamazaki Kataie became the lord of the Mita Domain in Settsu Province with 23,000 koku. Yamazaki Iemori became the lord of the Wakasa Domain in Inaba Province with 30,000 koku. His son, Yamazaki Ieharu, was transferred to the Tominoka Domain in Higo Province and then to the Marugame Domain in Sanuki Province. The Marugame Domain was passed down until Yamazaki Haruyori, but the clan lost their status. Yamazaki Toyoharu was granted 5,000 koku and continued the lineage in Inaba, Sanuki Province. Yamazaki Harutoshi petitioned for feudal lord status, adding the Nariwa Domain to reach 12,000 koku after the Restoration of Imperial Rule. The clan was granted over 12,746 koku and the Nariwa Domain was established during the Meiji Restoration. During the Meiji Restoration period, the head of the Yamazaki clan,  Yamazaki Harumasa, submitted a petition for the promotion of his feudal status, requesting to add 7,000 koku of land to his existing 12,000 koku, making it a total of 19,746 koku. This petition was granted on May 15th of the first year of the Meiji era, thanks to the recommendation of Prince Yoshiaki of Niinawa Temple, who later became Prince Akinori of Komatsu Palace, stating that the Yamazaki family was a descendant of the Uda Genji clan, which was related to Emperor Uda. In 1869, Yamazaki Harutoshi passed on the clan headship to his legitimate son, who was subsequently ennobled as a member of the peerage. Yamazaki Harutoshi served as the governor of the Naruwa Domain until the abolition of the feudal domains in the fourth year of the Meiji era. In 1884, with the implementation of the Peerage Act, the Yamazaki clan was elevated to the rank of baron within the peerage system. \n\n\n== The Yamazaki clan of Echizen Province ==\nThe other Yamazaki clan\nThe Yamazaki clan of Echizen Province is a branch of the Akamatsu clan. According to the \"Yamazaki-kefu\" genealogy, a descendant of Akamatsu Ujinao named Hizen-no-kami settled in Yamazaki village in Yamashiro Province and took the village name as his surname. His seventh-generation grandson, Yamazaki Nagatoki, descended to Echizen and served Ashikaga Takakage. The Yamazaki clan, including  Yamazaki Yoshie, perished along with the Asakura clan. However, Yamazaki Nagatoku, the sole survivor, served Akechi Mitsuhide and Sakuma Morimasa before becoming a retainer of Maeda Toshinaga, the lord of Kanazawa Domain. From then on, his descendants continued to serve as important retainers of the Maeda clan until the Meiji period.\nThe Yamazaki clan of Suruga Province and Sagami Province\nThis is the story of a clan from Suruga Province and Sagami Province. \nThey were a branch of the Fujiwara clan and received protection from the Takeda clan of Kai and the Imagawa clan of Suruga during the late Muromachi period. Later, this clan was given land near Sunpu by the Imagawa clan and settled in Shizuoka. The main branch, which had received protection, then turned to the Tokugawa clan after the downfall of the Imagawa clan. After the fall of the Hojo clan, they led their followers to develop and settle in the devastated Gokuya region of Odawara. They became the headman responsible for managing the land tax of the Odawara Domain in that region. The clan changed their name, and the followers moved to the surrounding areas as the Yamazaki faction.\nThe Yamazaki clan from Satsuma Province\nThe Yamazaki clan of Satsuma Province is said to have originated in the Yamazaki district of Isa County. It is believed that Yamazaki was established as their territory by Yamazaki Shigemochi, the third son of Kito-in. However, with the decline of the Kito-in clan, the Yamazaki clan disappeared from that area. The Kito-in clan, after being defeated by the Shimazu clan, sought refuge with the Ouchi clan and moved to Hyūga and Bungo provinces.\nThe Yamazaki clan of Musashi Province\nDescendants of Musashi Province. A clan of the Ono clan, a branch of the Yokoyama clan.\n The Yamazaki family from Tosa Province\nThe Yamasaki clan of Tosa Province, descended from the Monowaki clan, settled in Murotsu village. Yamazaki Yamashige, also known as Kageyoshi, became the lord of Makiyama village and established Yamasaki Castle. Yamashige had nine sons who migrated to various places such as Tosa Yamada Town, Nahari Town, Kagami Town, Kochi City, and Sagawa Town. Some of his sons were killed in the Battle of Tsuchigawa. The main branch of the Yamazaki clan is located in the Shio settlement, where they worship the ancestral Hachiman deity and the heavenly deity Misaki-sama.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYamazaki clan\nNariwa Domain\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nYamazaki Ieharu\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Japanese clans",

        "content": "The siege of Oran was a military campaign launched by the Regency of Algiers, led by Muhammad el Kebir, against the Spanish garrison of Oran. The Algerians occupied the city after a siege that lasted from 1790 to 1792, ending the Spanish occupation that lasted for 300 years.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1785, the Spanish began negotiations with Algiers and were willing to cede Oran and Mers el-Kebir if they would be allowed to retain their trading posts in return for Algiers to cease their attacks on Spanish vessels. The Algerians were happy with these terms; however, the Spanish population was outraged with these terms, forcing their government to delay carrying them out. The death of Charles III of Spain and the breakout of the French Revolution forced the Spanish to forget about Oran. The Dey of Algiers was becoming impatient with their false promises and began blockading Oran in 1789.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nIn October 1790, Muhammad Bey began the siege of Oran with an army of 30,000 men. The Bey considered using mining explosives against the city walls; however, a violent earthquake struck Oran and devastated the town, destroying most of the city and killing more than 2,000 of its inhabitants. The Algerians used this opportunity and launched a swift assault into the city, but the Spanish garrison resisted fiercely and repelled the assault. The Algerians then began besieging the city more closely. The Spanish began opening negotiations in August or September 1791. Both sides agreed to a treaty which confirmed the earlier terms. In early 1792, the Spanish evacuated the town along with their belongings, and in March, the Algerians occupied the city.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Algerians began repopulating the city with Arabs and Jews, which remained under their control for 40 years. The Ottoman sultan sent his praises, when the city returned under Muslim control, which ended the Spanish control that lasted three hundred years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlan G.

        "content": "On October 1, 2023, rebels from the CSP-PSD attacked Malian forces in Bamba, Gao Region, Mali.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the start of 2023, tensions had intensified between the Malian junta that took power in 2021 and the allied Wagner Group mercenaries against the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD), a coalition of the former rebel Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) and the pro-government Platform militias. Malian and Wagner forces attacked the town of Ber in August 2023, the first major clashes between the two groups since the signing of the Algiers Accords in 2015. CSP-PSD spokesmen denounced the attack, and stated that retaliation would occur. The CSP-PSD then declared war on the Malian junta, and attacked Malian forces in Bourem, Léré, and Dioura. \nOn September 7, 2023, jihadists from Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin raided the Malian military camp at Bamba in a simultaneous attack on the camp and a civilian ship in Gourma-Rharous.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nThe CSP-PSD and CMA attacked the military camp in Bamba at 6am on the morning of October 1. Because of the jihadist attack less than a month beforehand, most of the camp had already been pillaged or damaged. Malian officials reported \"intense fighting\" at the camp later on the day of October 1, and the CSP-PSD claimed the capture of the military camp around the same time. RFI later confirmed photographs that showed that CSP-PSD and the CMA were in control of the camp at Bamba. The CSP-PSD and CMA took Malian equipment from the camp as they left.\nThe Malian army did not release a statement on the aftermath of the attacks, including the casualties of Malian or rebel soldiers. The CSP-PSD announced the deaths of twenty-five Malian soldiers during the attack along with six taken prisoner, and showcased videos of three captured VP11 vehicles and two pieces of heavy artillery. The CSP-PSD claimed that they only suffered one dead fighter and four injured fighters.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFour days after the attack, the CSP-PSD ambushed Malian forces at the dam in Taoussa. The CSP-PSD claimed the deaths of nine Malian soldiers and two taken prisoner, as well as the destruction of thirteen vehicles and twelve others captured.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The USM Alger-RS Berkane matches is a football matches, counting for the semi-finals of the 2023–24 CAF Confederation Cup. Each tie in the knockout phase is being played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. Due to the issue of the map of Morocco including Western Sahara on RS Berkane’s shirt, both matches were not played. The case was referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\n\n== The issue of Western Sahara ==\n\nThe territory of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara has caused a deep-seated antagonism and general mistrust between Algeria and Morocco that has permeated all aspects of Moroccan-Algerian relations. After Spain announced its intention to abandon the territory in 1975, relations between Morocco and Algeria, both of which had previously presented a united front, disintegrated.\nAlgeria, although not asserting any territorial claims of its own, was averse to the absorption of the territory by any of its neighbors and supported the Polisario Front's wish to create an independent nation in the territory. Before the Spanish evacuation, the Spanish government had agreed to divide the territory, transferring the majority of the land to Morocco and the remainder to Mauritania. This agreement violated a United Nations (UN) resolution that declared all historical claims by Mauritania or Morocco to be insufficient to justify territorial absorption and drew heavy criticism from Algeria.\n\n\n== Algiers match ==\n\nThree days before the match, RS Berkane traveled to Algeria, where they were allowed to take a direct flight from Berkane to Algiers instead of passing through Tunisia (while Algerian skies were closed to flights from Morocco). Due to the ambiguity regarding the match shirts which show the map of Morocco, including Western Sahara, a territory 80% controlled by Morocco and claimed by the Sahrawi separatists of the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria. Algeria has also severed its diplomatic relations with its Moroccan neighbor because of this issue, Algerian customs asked to see these jerseys and did not allow the delegation to take them. After the letter from the CAF interclub relations manager, the USMA lodged an appeal and the CAF jury responded. Emad Chenouda responded that the Club Commission had decided to keep this jersey despite the refusal of the Algerian authorities. USM Alger which appealed this decision via the Algerian Football Federation, received a negative response.\nThe semi-final first leg of the CAF Confederation Cup between USM Alger and RS Berkane has been canceled. The Berkane players refused to play with the jackets provided by the Algerian Federation and without their “official” jerseys. Despite their presence at Stade du 5 Juillet, the Moroccans refused to go onto the field. The president of the Moroccan club Hakim Benabdellah told CAF officials that there is no match without the jerseys circulating all over the map of the Kingdom of Morocco. FAF president Walid Sadi announced that he intended to bring the matter before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). “Our position is clear, we will not back down and we are ready for anything”. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) indicated that the first leg of the semi-final of the Confederation Cup did not take place on April 21, 2024, in Algiers as planned. The matter will be brought before the competent authorities. CAF apologizes for any inconvenience caused to sponsors, TV partners and supporters. On April 24, The CAF Interclub Competitions and Management of the Club Licensing System Committee met to deliberate on the incident between USM Alger and RS Berkane, they decided to Sanction USM Alger with a forfeit of 0–3, and To Submit the case to the Disciplinary Board for possible additional sanctions. The second leg fixture at the Berkane Municipal Stadium on 28 April 2024 is maintained.\n\n\n== Berkane match ==\nDespite the lingering crisis due to the first leg, USM Alger traveled to Morocco on April 26 aboard a private Egyptian plane on a direct flight. although the meeting is not expected to take place again. The FAF received a new letter from CAF, notifying a rejection of the appeal lodged after the decision to declare USM Algiers forfeited in the first leg. During the technical meeting before the match was held in the presence of the leaders of USM Alger and RS Berkane and representatives of the Algerian and Moroccan federations. Where did RS Berkane indicate that she planned to wear the flocked jersey set of the map of Morocco with Western Sahara.\nUSM Alger refused to play since the Moroccan club still wears its jersey with the country's disputed map on the chest. The officials waited a quarter of an hour before realizing that one of the two teams had not left the locker room. At this time, RS Berkane players entered the stadium to greet their supporters while USM Alger players left the municipal stadium towards Oujda to make the return trip to Algiers. Before kick-off, RS Berkane supporters brandished a “tifo” with the map of Morocco showing the disputed territory. CAF awarded RS Berkane qualification for the final of this competition. The FAF has initiated a procedure to appeal the CAF sanction before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, considering that the Cairo-based body has \"validated the Moroccan club's request to wear a jersey with a political message\" during the home and away semi-final. On May 2, CAF designated RS Berkane as finalist of the Confederation Cup and declared to transmit the file to the disciplinary committee for possible other sanctions against the FAF.\n\n\n== At the Court of Arbitration for Sport ==\n\nIn accordance with article 48 paragraph 3 of the CAF Statutes, this decision is subject, according to the appeal jury, to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) within ten days from notification of the decision. decision and must include all the element documents appearing in point 2 of the directives emanating from the CAS. For its part, the FAF, through its general secretariat, had contacted the General Secretariat of the CAF, on April 14, 2021, regarding the geographical map published on the official website of the African body and which is not not consistent with official maps of the United Nations and the African Union (AU) where the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD) and not Western Sahara.\nOn April 23, 2024, the Algerian Football Federation and USM Alger filed a request with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne through a law firm specializing in this type of case. The motion was filed for summary judgment for emergency judgment. A company made up of experienced lawyers has been appointed to defend the Algerian cause. In its complaint USMA highlighted the violations by RS Berkane and CAF of the articles of the statutes and regulations of the latter, including those relating to equipment, namely articles 59 and 60 or even law 4 of the IFAB. \nOn May 2, the CAS announced that it had rejected the request for interim relief to suspend the decision of the CAF appeal jury which validated the use of the RS Berkane jersey, in the absence of a response from the Confederation of African Football. However, the case remains open on the merits and the court is in the process of collecting the elements of each party. After the Competitions Commission of the Confederation of African Football approved the qualification of RS Berkane for the Confederation Cup final, against the backdrop of a political-judicial conflict which ended in the CAS offices, the Algerian Football Federation is preparing to submit a new request to the CAS, with the aim of temporarily stopping the final scheduled by the Pan-African body in two matches on May 12 and 19. In this regard, the FAF requested that the case be heard by a single judge. This request did not encounter any opposition from the parties concerned, namely CAF, FRMF and RS Berkane.\nOn May 10, the Lausanne court once again rejected a request from USM Alger to suspend the Confederation Cup final, pending the conclusion of arbitration proceedings with CAF in the RS Berkane affair.\n\n\n== Subsequent events ==\nThe Sahrawi Football Federation has broken its silence regarding the jersey crisis. The Western Sahara Sports Federation described the actions of RS Berkane as a Moroccan maneuver aimed at legitimizing the occupation through sport and achieving political objectives far from the sporting domain. According to Article 50 of the Olympic Charter (paragraph 2), no kind of political, religious or racial demonstration or propaganda is permitted in an Olympic venue, site or other location.\nOn April 23, 2024, Algeria men's under-17 handball team withdrew from the match against Morocco during the Arab Youth Championship organized in Morocco. The Algerian Handball Federation decided to withdraw after confirming that Morocco would participate with a jersey bearing the map including Western Sahara.\nOn April 28, 2024, the Algerian Gymnastics Federation officially announced the withdrawal of its national teams, men and women, from the upcoming African Nations Championship, which will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco. According to the press release published on the official page of the relevant sports authority, the Algerian delegation did not obtain the necessary authorizations from the Ministry of Youth and Sports to travel to Morocco. The MJS had decided to freeze Algeria's participation in all sporting events in which Moroccan teams would participate, waiting for the International Olympic Committee to put matters into context and put them into practice. As a reminder, Algeria was to take part in these African artistic gymnastics championships, qualifiers for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\nThe Algerian Olympic Committee officially contacted the International Olympic Committee to denounce the multiple violations committed by Morocco after the RS Berkane affair and what happened during the Arab Under-21 Handball Championship. The request presented by the AOC is essentially based on the provisions of Article 52 of the Olympic Charter, which refers to the prohibition of any practice. political, religious or racist advertising slogan during various sports competitions. The AOC clearly indicated that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is a state in itself recognized by the African Union and that the issue is still pending at the level of the United Nations.\nThe former star striker of the pharaohs Mido criticized the \"blindness\" of Egyptian officials to Morocco's control over the African football confederation. Mido said “The head office of CAF is located in Egypt but decisions are made in Morocco” and added, “They left us the CAF building and they took charge of all the bodies of African football. This was all planned 10 years ago.” And to conclude, “They took everything from home and we are proud to have the headquarters. while the operations take place in Morocco ».\nOn ON Time Sports channel, Fouzi Lekjaa president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and member of the FIFA executive committee, confirmed that he does not intervene in any way in the appointment of referees for Moroccan club matches at the club championship level or for the Moroccan national team through the continental championships through its influence within the Confederation of African Football. Lekjaa said “If I had been responsible for appointing the referees, the club to which I belong RS Berkane, would have won all the major championships on the African continent”.\n\nI have been president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation for 7 or 8 years. I have never spoken to CAF about the appointment of a referee to direct a match of a Moroccan club or national team. He said that if I had been responsible for appointing referees, the club I belong to, RS Berkane, would have won all the major championships on the African continent, and the Moroccan national team would have also won the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Their Rainbow Had Black Edges is a 1943 crime thriller novel by English writer Gerald Butler. It is his third novel and is written in the noir style popular at the time.\nThe first British hardcover edition was published by Jarrolds Publishing in July 1943. This was Butler's first novel to be published outside of England, with American publishers Farrar & Rinehart signing him to a multi-book contract. Their Rainbow Had Black Edges was published in the United States under the alternative title Dark Rainbow on 8 November 1945.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nTheir Rainbow Had Black Edges is the story of a soldier who never saw the war. The world would call Ranny weak-minded; the only thing in him that had any lasting strength was his love for Elizabeth. Across the pages of this book crawls boredom, maddening boredom, and the yearnings for a woman's arms. Then in breathless sequence come desertion, discovery, arrest. But on the long, dragging journey back, the fires burn again inside him, and he risks a desperate break away from his armed escort. Finally the woman who loves and hides him is faced with a choice that she hardly dares to make. \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for The Lewiston Daily Sun, R.W.L. noted: \"Men, especially, will like Gerald Butler's first novel to be introduced outside his native England. \"Dark Rainbow,\" is a bitter and powerful tale, but service-men will understand it, and the author has made no attempt to spare the reader the disastrous effect of likable, patriotic young Rannington's long confinement in various army camps. Gripping, well-written, this story shows vividly the futility of war.\nFor The New York Times, A.B. was less flattering: \"It is all too unbelievably and protractedly coy. The unhappy ending is as superficial as all that went before. IT is hard to accept the notion that this is a superior enough example of current English writing to have been worth importing.\"\nThe New Yorker was more flattering, \"Since the deserter's motivation is seldom clear enough, the tragedy which ensues does not quote come off. Nevertheless, the chase over the now familiar English countryside and in blacked-out railway compartments is a professional piece of work, and the author's friendly attitude toward his caddish hero may be the start of a postwar trend.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nJuly 1943 Jarrolds Publishing, UK, first hardcover edition\n1945 Jarrolds Publishing, UK, hardcover edition (re-print)\n8 November 1945 Farrar & Rinehart, US, hardcover edition under the title Dark Rainbow\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGoble, Alan.

        "content": "Bargi hydroelectric power station (Italian: Centrale idroelettrica di Bargi) is a hydroelectric power station in the north-central part of Italy, in the Emilia-Romagna region. It uses reservoirs created in the confluence of two right tributaries of the river Reno, which flows into the Adriatic Sea north of Ravenna).\nBack in 1911, the Brasimone reservoir with a volume of 6.4 million cubic metres was created with the help of a 40-meter high brick dam. It was located on the stream of the same name, which flows from the left into the Setta River (the right tributary of the Reno), and fed the Santa Maria power plant.\nAnd in 1932, to the west of the Setta watershed, on the Limentra di Treppio river (another right tributary of Reno), the Suviana reservoir was built, originally intended only to feed its own hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of 27 MW. The 96-meter-high and 225-meter-long gravity dam built here, which required 288,000 m3 of material, holds a reservoir with a volume of 46.7 million m3 (useful volume 43.9 million m3). It can be noted that, in addition to the direct flow, an additional resource comes to this reservoir from the western direction - from the Pavana reservoir on the Limentra di Sambuca (another right tributary of Reno) and from the Molino del Pallone water intake dam on Reno itself.\n\n\n== References ==",

The film was produced by James Kenyon and Sagar Mitchell.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film shows employees of all ages, including children, leaving the Williamson's factory in Lancashire after a full work day. While most of the employees depart the factory on foot a few jump on the back of trailers being pulled by horses or using personal bicycles. The film is one of some early films that shows that child labour was seen as acceptable among families as many families were considered poor or seen as the lower class. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Honourable Sir Edward Marmaduke Joseph Vavasour, 1st Baronet DL (formerly Edward Marmaduke Joseph Stourton; 6 May 1786 – 16 March 1847) was an English landowner and baronet.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nVavasour was born on 6 May 1786 as Edward Marmaduke Joseph Stourton. He was the son of Charles Stourton, 17th Baron Stourton and Hon. Mary Langdale. His elder brother was William Stourton, 18th Baron Stourton and his younger brother was Charles Langdale, the Whig MP for Beverley and Knaresborough.\nHis paternal grandparents were William Stourton, 16th Baron Stourton and Winifred Howard (a leading Roman Catholic who was a great-granddaughter of the 6th Duke of Norfolk). His mother was a daughter of Marmaduke, 5th Baron Langdale and his wife, Constantia Smythe (a sister of Walter Smythe and, therefore, an aunt of Maria Anne Smythe, who, following her second marriage became known as Mrs. Fitzherbert, the longtime companion of George, Prince of Wales, later King George IV).\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe gained the rank of Captain between 1817 and 1824 in the Yorkshire Hussars. On 27 February 1826 his name was legally changed to Edward Marmaduke Joseph Vavasour by Royal Licence, after inheriting the Vavasour estates of his maternal cousin, Sir Thomas Vavasour, the seventh and last Vavasour Baronet of the 1628 creation. He was created 1st Baronet Vavasour, of Hazelwood, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 14 February 1828.\nHe served as a Deputy Lieutenant of Yorkshire.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 6 August 1813, he married Marcia Bridget Lane-Fox, daughter of James Fox-Lane, MP for Horsham, and Hon. Marcia Lucy Pitt (daughter of British diplomat and politician George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers). Together, they were the parents of:\n\nSir Edward Marmaduke Joseph Vavasour, 2nd Baronet (1815–1885), who died unmarried.\nMarcia Mary Vavasour (1816–1883), who married William Constable-Maxwell, 10th Lord Herries of Terregles in 1835\nCharles Joseph Vavasour (1817–1846), who died unmarried.\nWilliam Joseph Vavasour (1822–1860), who married Hon. Mary Constantia Clifford, daughter of Hugh Clifford, 7th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, in 1846.\nGeorge Joseph Vavasour (1824–1895), who married  Amalia Ernestina Elizabatha Bell, daughter of Carl Theodor Bell, in 1850. After her death in 1861, he married Anne Heppenstall, daughter of John Heppenstall, in 1880. They divorced in 1889.\nPhilip Joseph Vavasour (1826–1887), a Roman Catholic priest who was Canon of the Chapter of the Diocese of Leeds.\nSir Edward died on 16 March 1847 near Dijon in Burgundy, while on a pilgrimage to Rome. As his eldest son Edward died unmarried in 1885, the baronetcy passed to his grandson, William, a son of his third son, William.\n\n\n== References ==",

The film is directed by Swedish director Henrik Burman, and produced by Björn Tjärnberg. The film will feature interviews from Chris Martin, Nile Rodgers and David Guetta among others.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie description from Tribeca Festival reads: \"Before there was Avicii, there was just Tim. For the first time through his own words, witness the journey of a shy but prodigious musical talent who would soon become one of the defining artists of his generation\". According to Billboard, the movie will include \"never-before-seen archive footage and interviews with Bergling himself\". It will also feature \"newly produced material, with interviews with Bergling's family, friends and colleagues\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe documentary was originally announced by the Avicii estate in September 2021, with a 2023 release date. The movie began production in 2019. Director Henrik Burman said about the film: \"My goal is to provide an honest and new perspective on both the artist Avicii and Tim's life. I want this to be a film that surprises the audience and challenges the public's image of Sweden's biggest international artist of today and, in doing so, also shine a light on what his music has meant to so many people.\"\nThe new release date was announced on Avicii's Instagram profile in April 2024. The wider release is yet to be confirmed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Peck's Ferry Bridge is a historic Warren truss bridge that carries Locktown-Flemington Road over Plum Brook in Delaware Township of Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. Built in 1900 by John W. Scott of Flemington, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1999, for its significance in engineering. It was reconstructed in 2004.\nThe 29 foot (8.8 m) long single-span bridge crosses Plum Brook, a tributary of the Wickecheoke Creek, which flows into the Delaware River at Prallsville. According to the nomination form, it is a modified Warren truss bridge. Scott also built the nearby Stone Sign Post Road Bridge over Plum Brook.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey\nList of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Remote Desktop Protocol clients allow users to connect to servers running Remote Desktop Services,  Azure Virtual Desktop, or non-Microsoft server software to enable remote desktop functionality. Since the release of Remote Desktop Connection, there have been several additional Remote Desktop Protocol clients created by both Microsoft and other parties.\n\n\n== By Microsoft ==\n\n\n=== Remote Desktop Connection ===\n\nRemote Desktop Connection (RDC, also called Remote Desktop or just RD) is the client application for RDS. The program has the filename mstsc.exe and in Windows 2000 and prior, it was known as Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC or tsclient). It allows a user to remotely log into a networked computer running the Remote Desktop Services. RDC presents the desktop interface (or application GUI) of the remote system, as if it were accessed locally. In addition to regular username/password for authorizing for the remote session, RDC also supports using smart cards for authorization.\nRDC 6.0 was released as part of Windows Vista. With RDC 6.0, the resolution of a remote session can be set independently of the settings at the remote computer. If the Desktop Experience component is plugged into the remote server, remote application user interface elements (e.g., application windows borders, Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons etc.) will take on the same appearance of local applications. In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use the resources of the local computer. Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the client system. Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the client system, independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC can also be used to connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.\nRDC prioritizes UI data as well as keyboard and mouse inputs, as opposed to print jobs or file transfers. so as to make the applications more responsive. It redirects plug and play devices such as cameras, portable music players, and scanners, so that input from these devices can be used by the remote applications as well.  RDC can also be used to connect to computers which are exposed via Windows Home Server RDP Gateway over the Internet. Finally, few shortcuts that will be handy\n\nTo achieve Ctrl+Alt+Del effect on remote desktop, you can use the Ctrl+Alt+End key combination.\nTo alternate between the full screen and window mode of remote desktop, you can use Ctrl+Alt+Break ( Ctrl+Fn+Alt+⇧ Shift on certain HP laptops).\n\n\n=== Microsoft Remote Desktop ===\n\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop, also called Remote Desktop, is a modern client for RDS released in September 2012. Compared to the older Remote Desktop Connection, the program offers a touch-friendly interface. It allows users to connect to remote PCs, RemoteApp programs, session-based desktops, and virtual desktops. The program is available on Windows as an Universal Windows Platform on the Microsoft Store, MacOS as Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac, Android, iOS, iPadOS, and on all platforms as a web client. The Windows version of the app is no longer being updated with new features or support for Azure Virtual Desktop. Instead, users are recommend to use the Remote Desktop client for Windows.\n\n\n==== Web client ====\nIn late 2018 Microsoft released an HTML5 web client for Microsoft Remote Desktop. The client allows users to connect to their remote apps or to their remote desktops without using an installed remote desktop client. is one of the components of Microsoft Windows that allow a user to initiate and control an interactive session The web client uses the TLS secured port 443 and does not use the RD Gateway to transport traffic, instead relying solely on the remote desktop session host aspect of remote desktop services.\n\n\n=== Remote Desktop client for Windows ===\nThe Remote Desktop client for Windows (MSRDC), branded as Microsoft Remote Desktop, Remote Desktop, and Azure Virtual Desktop if installed from the Microsoft Store, is a client that uses the Remote Desktop Protocol to allow users to connect to Azure Virtual Desktops on feeds made available by enterprise administrators. The program can be downloaded as an MSI installer as Remote Desktop or from the Microsoft Store as Azure Virtual Desktop.\nIn contrast with Microsoft Remote Desktop and like the older Remote Desktop Connection program, MSRDC allows for the redirection of local USB and serial devices. MSRDC is also used by Windows Subsystem for Linux to display programs with a graphical user interface.\n\n\n=== Windows Mobile ===\nA RDS client also existed for Windows Mobile called Remote Desktop.\n\n\n== Non-Microsoft ==\nThere have been numerous non-Microsoft implementations of clients that implement subsets of the Microsoft functionality for a range of platforms.\n\n\n=== rdesktop ===\n\nrdesktop is a free and open-source implementation of a client software for RDP. rdesktop supports most features of RDP 5, with features from RDP 5.1 and 6 not yet implemented. Unlike its Microsoft counterparts, it still supports the older RDP 4 protocol used by Windows NT 4.0. There also several graphical frontends to rdesktop including tsclient, Gnome-RDP, and KDE Remote Desktop Connection (KRDC).\n\n\n=== FreeRDP ===\nFreeRDP is a RDP client that started as a fork of redesktop in 2009. It was created with the aim of modularizing the code, addressing various issues, and implementing new features. FreeRDP comes with its own command-line-client xfreerdp, which supports Seamless Windows in RDP6. Around 2011, the project decided to abandon forking and instead rewrite under Apache License, adding more features like RemoteFX, RemoteApp, and NTLMv2. A commercial distribution called Thincast was started in 2019. A multi-platform client based on FreeRDP including Vulkan/H.264 support followed in summer 2020. There's a GTK-based client named Remmina also based on FreeRDP.\nFreeRDP offers server implementations for macOS and Windows. On other systems including Linux, software packages may build upon FreeRDP to implement a complete server. Weston, the compositor in Wayland, uses FreeRDP to implement an rdp server it terms \"rdp-backend\". This server is in turn used by Microsoft to provide graphics support (WSLg) in its Windows Subsystem for Linux. \n\n\n=== Remmina ===\n\nRemmina is a free and open-source remote desktop client for POSIX-based system that supports RDP along with a verity of other protocols. It uses FreeRDP as a foundation. It is the default remote desktop client on Ubuntu.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComparison of remote desktop software\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Klara Chaje Blum (simplified Chinese: 朱白兰; traditional Chinese: 朱白蘭; pinyin: Zhū Báilán; November 27, 1904 – May 5, 1971) was a Jewish German-language writer in Austria, the Soviet Union, and China.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKlara Blum was born in 1904 to a Jewish family in Chernivtsi, in what is now Ukraine but at the time was controlled by Austria-Hungary. Her father, Josef Blum, was a landowner and local politician. He began to clash with her mother, Cipre Maschler Kaner, who was 26 years his junior and became empowered by the early feminist movement to challenge his authority; the two eventually divorced in 1913.\nAround that time, as World War I began, 9-year-old Klara and her mother fled to Vienna. She later sought a Romanian passport, as her hometown had come under Romanian control, but she primarily lived in Vienna to care for her ailing mother. \nAfter graduating high school in 1922, Blum undertook university studies in literature and psychology, but she likely did not complete them due to financial struggles.\n\n\n== Career beginnings in Vienna ==\nIn the 1920s, Blum began writing poetry, as well as articles for such Jewish publications as the Ostjüdische Zeitung and Czernowitzer Allgemeine Zeitung. An active Zionist in this period, she migrated to Palestine in 1929, but she left shortly after, dissatisfied with her experience. After many years as a Zionist, she would turn away from the movement in her later years, writing in her will of \"the disgrace that the state of Israel, this tool of U.S. imperialism, has brought upon my people.\"\nAfter three years as a member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party in the early 1930s, in which time she wrote for such Viennese publications as the Arbeiter-Zeitung, she shifted her sympathies to the Communist Party, though she did not formally join.\n\n\n== Soviet exile ==\nAfter Hitler's rise to power, Blum was awarded a two-month fellowship in the Soviet Union for a poem she wrote in 1934, and she used the opportunity to settle in the country for what would become 11 years. She gained Soviet citizenship in 1935. While there, she wrote and translated literary works and reviews for the journal International Literature and other publications. \nIn 1939, she published the poetry collections Die Antwort in Moscow and Erst Becht! in Kyiv. Her other German-language poetry collections in this period included Wir entscheiden alles (1941), Donauballaden (1942), and Schlachtfeld and Erdball (1944).\n\n\n== Move to China ==\nIn 1937, Blum began a love affair with the Chinese communist activist and journalist Zhu Xiangcheng (born 1901), whom she had met in Moscow. The two lost contact the following year, after spending only four months together, and while Zhu was thought to be dead, Blum was convinced he was still out there, working for the revolution. So when World War II ended and German exiles in the Soviet Union began to disperse, Blum headed for China in an effort to locate her lost love. After significant difficulty obtaining a visa, she arrived in China in August 1947 with the assistance of the Shanghai Jewish Rescue Committee.\nSettling in Shanghai, she began teaching the following year at Tongji University, learning to lecture in Chinese, although she would have to leave the position after less than a year. She continued to search to no avail for Zhu, declaring herself her lover's \"wife.\" Records later revealed, toward the end of Blum's life, that Zhu had died in a Siberian labor camp in 1943.\nWhile in China, Blum continued to write poetry and fiction, which often touched on Chinese themes and echoed Chinese literary styles. In 1949, she produced the autobiographical novel The Shepherd and the Weaver (Der Hirte und die Weberin), which was published in East Germany in 1951. Her other works in this period include the collection of five novellas Das Lied von Hongkong (1959) and the unpublished 1962 autobiographical novel Die Schicksalsüberwinder (\"Overcomer of Fate\"). \nBlum is thought to be the only Jewish female poet of Chinese nationality to compose in German. Though she moved away from Jewish religiosity, she still identified strongly as a Jewish person throughout her life.\nIn her later career, she also worked as a translator; she had previously translated from Russian to German while still in the Soviet Union. In China, she translated poetry by Mao Zedong from Chinese to German. She also continued to publish German-language articles in East Germany. Starting in 1952, she became a German professor at Shanghai's Fudan University. She later left Shanghai after fighting with a fellow European professor, and beginning in 1957 she taught at Guangzhou's Zhangshan University.\nBlum obtained Chinese citizenship on June 21, 1954. She adopted the Chinese name Zhu Bailan, taking her lost lover's family name and choosing a personal name meaning \"white orchid.\"\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nKlara Blum died of liver disease in 1971, at age 67, in Guangzhou.\nIn 2008, a street in Vienna was renamed Klara Blum Gasse in her honor. Her novel Der Hirte und die Weberin, considered her most important work, was re-published in Germany in 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 25, 2024, an occupation protest began at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to protest the administration's investments in Israel. The occupation, self-titled as the 'Palestine Solidarity Encampment', was a part of pro-Palestine protests on university campuses campaigning for divestment from Israel. The encampment was attacked multiple times by counter protestors, leading to clashes. On May 2, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) raided and dismantled the encampment, arresting the protestors and ending the occupation.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn April 17, pro-Palestinian protestors at Columbia University began an occupation protest on its campus to protest Columbia's investments in Israel amid the Israel–Hamas war. The protest, as well as its forced dismantling (when university president Minouche Shafik authorized the New York City Police Department to storm the campus and conduct mass arrests) sparked a series of nationwide protests and encampments for divestment.\nUCLA has associations with organizations that invest in Israeli manufacturing companies. UCLA also has investments in BlackRock, which does business in Israel and has holdings in weapon manufacturing companies.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== April 25 ===\nOn April 25, students and faculty set up the encampment. They released a list of demands, including UCLA’s divestment from companies that profit off the Israel-Hamas War, a disclosure of where the UC system is investing tuition money, the UC system to cut ties with city police departments who police student activism, an end to academic collaboration with institutions that are profiting and collaborating with Israel, and an immediate and permanent ceasefire. \nProtestors erected wooden barricades and displayed signs that included slogans such as \"UCLA says Free Palestine\" and \"UC has blood on it's hands.\" The 'Palestine Solidarity Encampment' group was set up, which includes the UC Divest Coalition, Students for Justice in Palestine, and Jewish Voice for Peace. IfNotNow was also present at the protests. The group posted online a list of demands for the administration, which includes divestment from Israel, calling for a ceasefire, and an academic boycott of Israel. \nMembers of pro-Israel groups included the Israeli American Council and United Jewish Coalition and other protestors in support of Israel surrounded the encampment. Some minor skirmishes between protestors were reported. \n\n\n=== April 26–29 ===\nOn April 26, the administration released a statement saying that it prioritized the safety of students and minimizing disruption, but also that it supported free expression on campus and was therefore not requesting law enforcement at that time. UCLA police patrolled the perimeter of the encampment. Some Israeli and Jewish students said they felt uncomfortable. Pro-Palestinian protestors requested UCLA to not send in police. On April 27, pro-Israel counter-protestors raised more than $50,000 in three hours on GoFundMe to fund a screen and loudspeaker. Jessica Seinfeld, the wife of American comedian Jerry Seinfeld also posted on her social media account on Instagram that she had donated $5,000 to the counter-protestors.\n\nOn April 28, the administration created a physical barrier to separate dueling protestors. Later in the day, demonstrators broke through and a confrontation ensued. It was unclear what side broke through the barrier, and the administration condemned the violence. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also clashed with police. Members of the Harriet Tubman Center for Social Justice held a solidarity demonstration with the pro-Palestinian protestors.\nOn April 29, faculty organized a walkout in solidarity with the protestors. Pro-Palestinian protestors set up metal barricades and appointed guards to block access to counter-protestors and media. Counter-protestors shouted through microphones and played loud music in front of the encampment early in the day. Later, a group of around 60 counter-protestors tried to breach the encampment, which led to heavy clashes. Security and UC officers with riot gear briefly intervened to separate the protestors. During clashes, counter-protestors released mice at the encampment.  In response to the attack, the Council on American–Islamic Relations called on UCLA administration to investigate it as a hate crime.\n\n\n=== April 30 ===\nA brief altercation between campus security and a disabled man occurred when the man tried to walk through a pathway blocked by the protest. The man said he was aware of the demonstrations, but didn't know that major pathways were blocked. Later in the afternoon, the UCLA Chancellor Gene Block shared a message with the UCLA community addressing the situation, stating that UCLA was increasing security presence on campus, removing barriers established by the encampment, and that the \"student conduct process has been initiated, and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion\" for any UCLA faculty, staff or students involved.\nVideo of a female Jewish student's bleeding head went viral. The student was admitted to the ER and is reported to be in stable condition.  The victim identified herself as Elinor Hess and claimed that she was shoved down when she reached to grab her flag, which fell down, and was kicked and pulled by the hair before she lost consciousness.\nIn an email to students, UCLA announced the extended closure of Powell Library and Royce Hall from 5:00 pm Tuesday, April 30. The facilities are planned to reopen Monday, May 6. \n\n\n=== May 1–2 ===\n\n\n==== Counter-protester attack ====\nOn Tuesday around 10:50 PM, a pro-Israeli group attacked the pro-Palestinian protesters' camp for nearly four hours, attempting to breach the barricades surrounding the encampment. The attackers, reported to have come from outside of campus, carried Israeli flags and assaulted students with sticks, stones, poles, metal fencing, and pepper spray. They played loud audio of a child crying, threw wood and a metal barrier into the camp, and shot at least 6 fireworks into the encampment, including one directly at a group of protestors carrying injured. A video investigation suggested pro-Palestinian protesters did not initiate any confrontation but acted in defense. The counter-protestors called for a \"Second Nakba\", referring to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948, and played the Israeli national anthem and Harbu Darbu on loud speakers during the attack. Security personnel hired by UCLA refused to intervene and stood to the side during the attack. LAPD officers arrived by 1:45 AM but waited at least an hour before intervening. None of the counter-protesters were known to have been arrested by the end of May 3rd, though UCLA was investigating the attackers with help from LAPD and FBI by May 7th. According to The Guardian, counter-protesters included several far-right activists involved in anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-vaccine campaigning.  \nFifteen people were reported injured, including one who was hospitalized. Student journalists for the Daily Bruin described being targeted by the counter-protestors and were punched, kicked, and beaten. Witnesses said the LAPD intervened after nearly four hours of attacks by the pro-Israel counter-demonstrators. One counterprotester stated, \"We were all waiting for the L.A.P.D. to show up, and they never did\". A report found one counter-protest group raised funds through GoFundMe, with Jessica Seinfeld and Bill Ackman donating $5,000 and $10,000, respectively. Both the LAPD and the university's hired security faced criticism for not protecting the encamped students. An Al Jazeera English correspondent on the scene reported, \"There seems to be absolutely no police intervention whatsoever.\"\n\n\n==== Forced disbandment ====\nIn the evening, law enforcement in riot gear issued a dispersal order to over a thousand people who had gathered in support of the encampment, stating anyone who refused to leave could face arrest.\n\nFollowing the previous night's dispersal order, an estimated 200 to 400 students remained on campus. At around 1:30 a.m. on May 2, LAPD officers broke into the encampment but were forced to retreat after they were outnumbered. After an hour, officers of the California Highway Patrol equipped in riot gear arrived at the campus to confront the protesters. Police reportedly fired a stun grenade, surrounded the encampment from all four sides, and began tearing down its walls, arresting 132 protestors, reportedly including at least one professor. Police were seen firing rubber bullets at the student protestors and methodically dismantling the encampment, that was cleared by the morning.\n\n\n=== May 6 ===\nOn the morning of Monday, May 6, social media users on X as well as reporters from the Daily Bruin started to report that members of UCPD were detaining and arresting pro-Palestine protestors in Parking Lot 2 in response to calls by protestors for a sit-in protest at Moore Hall. According to the newspaper, 43 protestors including UCLA students were arrested on the scene. On the same day, UAW Local 4811, the chapter representing over 48,000 University of California workers under the United Auto Workers union, issued its strike authorization vote to be held between May 13 and 15.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nFollowing the attack on the encampment by Pro-Israel counter-protestors on May 1, California governor Gavin Newsom stated, \"The limited and delayed campus law enforcement response at UCLA last night was unacceptable — and it demands answers\". Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a statement saying police had responded to a request from UCLA administration, later describing the violence as \"abhorrent\". Following the police storming of the encampment, U.S. president Joe Biden said he supported law enforcement, stating, \"We’re a civil society and order must prevail\".\n\n\n=== At UCLA ===\n\nIn a statement, the protesters said, \"The life-threatening assault we face tonight is nothing less than a horrifying, despicable act of terror. Law enforcement simply stood at the edge of the lawn and refused to budge as we screamed for their help.\" One student speaking to CNN stated, \"The police the university had hired, the private security guards, stared and watched as this happened\". Another student speaking to The Guardian said after being twice hit over the head, he \"was left with stitches on his forehead and 14 staples in the back of his head\". The editorial board for the student newspaper, The Daily Bruin, released an op-ed condemning the university for failing to protect students and the encampment.\nUCLA Chancellor Gene Block released a statement denouncing the May 1 conflict, stating \"this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable\", describing the counter-protesters who attacked the encampment as \"instigators\".\nFaculty condemned the lack of a response to the counter-protestors, including Ananya Roy, who said, \"The word is out they can do this repeatedly and get away with it. I am ashamed of my university.  A UCLA professor of Jewish history, David N. Myers, stated that \"some of the attackers appeared to be carrying Israeli flags and other pro-Israel symbols\", in reference to the violence.\nThe administration released an email statement saying that they were \"sickened\" by the violence and that they called law enforcement to help control the situation. UCLA cancelled classes and alerted students that there would be \"law enforcement presence stationed throughout campus.\" Remote instruction was announced for Thursday and Friday classes. Faculty members of the History Department released a statement condemning the violent attacks on the students and called for the UCLA Chancellor as well as the UC President to be held accountable for their inaction.\nThe Faculty for Justice in Palestine chapter at UCLA called for a labor strike on May 2, 2024.\n UAW Local 4811, the union representing over 48,000 academic workers at the 11 UC campuses announced that it would hold a strike authorization vote within a week in response to the violence against students at UCLA.\n The UCLA branch of Hillel International, an organization that supports Jewish life and Israel on student campuses released an unsigned statement condemning the violent attack on all students and requesting off-campus Jewish community to stay away from on-campus protests.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nIn an op-ed in The Guardian, activist Judith Levine criticized U.S. media coverage of the counterprotester attack, particularly outlets' refraining from assigning blame and for using the passive voice.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nApril 2024 Israel–Hamas war protests on university campuses in the United States\n2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupation\n2024 University of Southern California pro-Palestinian campus occupation\n2024 University of Oregon pro-Palestinian campus occupation\n2024 University of Virginia pro-Palestinian campus occupation\nBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions\nStudent protest\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to 2024 UCLA pro-Palestinian campus occupation at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Kreation Music Rights is a South Korean music publishing company and a subsidiary of SM Entertainment. It was launched in 2023 as part of the company's SM 3.0 strategy. As of April 2024, KMR has recruited around 100 songwriters, making it the largest company of its kind in the K-pop industry.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn August 2023, SM Entertainment CEO Jang Cheol-hyuk announced plans during an investor presentation to launch a new music publishing company called Kreation Music Rights (KMR), as part of the SM 3.0 strategy. SM converted the existing SM Friends subsidiary into a music publishing label to support SM's newly established multi-production center system, providing a wider pool of songs for artists. It was also intended to provide an additional revenue stream for the company, enabling the internalization of royalties and music sales to other companies. KMR was launched in September 2023, with investment of 27.1 billion won. Lee Sung-soo, SM's chief A&R officer and longtime head of production, was appointed CEO.\nKMR established a European office in Stockholm in December 2023. Writers signed to the company include Norwegian songwriting team Dsign Music, responsible for songs such as Girls' Generation's \"Genie\", NCT Dream's \"ISTJ\" and Taemin's \"Want\", and Sweden-based duo Sunshine, responsible for Red Velvet's \"Psycho\" and Aespa's \"Spicy\". KMR also acquired the South Korean production teams MonoTree and The Hub, joining the Kangta-led Smash Hit as CICs (company-in-company). It has plans to establish a North American subsidiary and form additional partnerships with local companies. KMR attracted controversy over its acquisition of The Hub and entertainment company 10x Entertainment, with allegations that it overpaid for the two companies. SM refuted this, explaining that The Hub showed rapid sales growth and 10x was part of its plan to establish a label. In March 2024, KMR launched the production label Kustomade, representing former Stray Kids member Kim Woo-jin and Yelo, a member of MonoTree. It signed a business agreement with the Dong-ah Institute of Media and Arts to foster new talent in the field of K-pop production.\n\n\n== Labels ==\nCompany-in-company\n\nMonoTree\nThe Hub\nSmash Hit\nBadX\nProduction labels\n\nKustomade\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lille 3000 is an association representing a cultural program promoted by the city of Lille and the Lille 2004 organizing committee.\nLille 3000 is intended as a continuation of the dynamism instilled by Lille in 2004 as the European Capital of Culture.\nLille 3000 reuses the cultural venues created or renovated for Lille 2004 (Tri Postal, Maisons Folies etc.); but also creates new ones (rehabilitation of the former Saint Sauveur goods station, which became a cultural center in 2009, etc.).\nTogether with the city, the association manages several of the cultural facilities mentioned above, and regularly organizes a wide range of activities, metamorphoses, shows, and exhibitions.\nEvery three years or so since 2006, Lille 3000 has also presented a series of major themed cultural events (cultural seasons) lasting several months and attracting millions of visitors, under the artistic direction of Didier Fusillier. These events open with a grand parade through the streets of Lille.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Bombayser de Lille ===\n\nThe main theme of Lille 3000's first cultural season, which ran from October 14, 2006, to January 14, 2007, was India, at the crossroads of art and modernity. It involved the organization of 450 events, including music, cinema, theater, dance, meetings, and exhibitions, attracting nearly a million visitors.\nThe Lille 3000 themes related to India were divided into several distinct categories, each held at different venues according to a calendar;\n\nMusic\nFilm, literature and fashion\nExhibitions\nTheater\nDance\nMaisons Folie\nMidi Midi\nMetamorphosis\n\n\n=== Europe XXL ===\n\nThe second season of Lille 3000, entitled Europe XXL, ran from March 14 to July 12, 2009. Its main theme was Eastern Europe, to mark the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It led to the organization of around 500 events and some 50 exhibitions and attracted almost a million visitors.\n\n\n=== Fantastic ===\nLille 3000's third season ran from October 6, 2012, to January 13, 2013. Its theme was the world of the supernatural, the fantastic, and the strange. It attracted almost two million visitors.\nIn addition to several shows and events, the season included installations throughout the city and numerous exhibitions in the metropolis' main museums.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nLille 3000's fourth season kicked off on September 26, 2015, inaugurated by a grand parade through the streets of Lille. This season aimed to showcase the vitality of the contemporary world, via numerous exhibitions and urban metamorphoses. The beginning of the 21st century embodies a turbulent era from which a new world is emerging, embodied here by major cities; represented for this edition were Rio, Detroit, Eindhoven, Phnom Penh and Seoul.\nRenaissance attracted 1.6 million visitors.\n\n\n=== Eldorado ===\nLille 3000's fifth season runs from April to December 2019 on the theme of Mexico. Eldorado attracted over 2.5 million visitors.\n\n\n=== The Great Eldorado Parade ===\n\n\n==== The parade schedule ====\nThis parade was composed mainly of five floats. There were many elements of the 2018 Fiesta de los Muertos sent by Mexico; but also harmonies, amateur participants and professional companies invited for the occasion. Four floats were imagined, decorated and orchestrated by Roubaix-based collective Art Point M: the Dia de los Muertos float featuring mariachis; the Frida-Khalo float; the Alebrijes float accompanied by Compagnie du Tire-Laine; and the Lucha Libre float re-enacting a live wrestling match.\n\nIn all, a dozen bands and 3,000 dancers, musicians and people in make-up or disguises paraded around the floats in Mexican colors.\n\n\n==== Parade entertainment ====\nOn Saturday, May 4, 2019, the festivities got underway at 3 pm at Tripostal and the Euralille shopping center, where children and adults got ready in make-up, costume, mask, and wreath workshops until 6 pm. And at 3 p.m., a flash mob set the pace in Place du Théâtre, opposite the Lille Opera House.\n\n\n==== Musiques de la parade ====\nDuring the parade, many artists were present on the floats. On the Dia de Los Muertos (“Day of the Dead”) float, the Mexican music group Mariachi Cocula6 was on hand to entertain the people of Lille along the established route. For the float representing Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, group 4cascabel6 played the Fandango, a musical genre with Latin and African influences. On the Alebrijes float (wooden statues representing fantastic animals and creatures), the Compagnie du Tire-Laine, an orchestra based in the Moulins district, brought together over sixty musicians. After the parade, they organized a grand ball on the Place du Théâtre at the end of the evening.\nThe festivities continued after the parade ended, from 10 pm to 1 am. Musicians from Soundtruck and DJ El Frances improvised a music studio in a Volkswagen van near Rue Nationale. In the Place du Théâtre, the group Kumbia Boruka, founded by Hernan Cortes, got the tourists up and dancing with its blend of Mexican accordion and Jamaican reggae. Other groups, such as Mariachi Los Tarasco and Theator Tol, offered songs and music from all over the world. Electro-house music was also in the spotlight on Place Rihour, where DJ Batichica, originally from Guadalajara in Mexico, presented a set of EDM (Electronic Dance Music).\n\n\n==== Parade safety ====\nAlong the entire parade route, between Place des Buisses and Champ de Mars, 250,000 spectators gathered to watch the nearly 800-meter-long procession pass by. The organizers had set up a restricted and regulated traffic and parking plan. A protective perimeter was set up by the national police in downtown Lille from 3 pm to 2 am. Streets affected by the parade were closed to traffic from 6.30 pm to 2 am. In some streets downstream from the starting point, visitors waited for two hours for the parade to pass. Most were on foot along the routes reserved for the floats, which slowed the parade's progress to the Champ de Mars.\n\n\n==== Parade postponed ====\nThe parade, scheduled for Saturday, April 27, 2019, has been postponed to Saturday, May 4, 2019, due to weather conditions (forecasts of high winds threatened the smooth running of the parade). The decision was taken on Thursday, April 25 by the lille3000 organization, Lille City Council, and the Nord prefecture. It was the first time in five editions that a lille3000 parade had been postponed. As a result of the postponement, some installations originally scheduled for the parade were not present.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nFor this season, a number of exhibitions on the theme of El Dorado (myth, travel, migration, nature, etc.) have been set up (see sub-sections below). Other major exhibitions are also on offer at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille, the Piscine in Roubaix, the Louvre-Lens and the Frac Grand Large in Dunkirk.\nMexican muralists, the “Tlacolulokos” duo (named after their native village), have been invited to paint three murals in the Mexican tradition, with local inspiration; two exhibitions are devoted to the art of fresco.\n\n\n=== Eldorama ===\nLe Tripostal hosts the Eldorado exhibition from April 27 to September 1, 2019. In three chapters, it retraces the great story of Eldorado. On the second floor, visitors will find the Dream Worlds section. The second floor features The Rush. Finally, on the top floor of the building, visitors can find the section entitled Un eldorado sans fin. Chinese artist Chen Zhen's dragon and Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama's light piece are also on show.\n\n\n=== Intenso/Mexicano ===\nIn this exhibition at the Hôtel de l'Hospice Comtesse from April 27 to August 30, 2019, visitors can discover works by the great names of Mexican art: Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and Manuel Álvarez Bravo. In all, 48 paintings, prints, and photographs from the permanent collection of Mexico City's Museo de Arte Moderno. The exhibition covers the Mexican 20th century.\n\n\n=== US-Mexico/Border ===\nFrom April 27 to July 28, Maison Folie in Wazemmes will be exhibiting “the work of contemporary artists who explore the border as both a physical reality and a subject of imagination and experimentation, enabling projects to emerge and solutions to be found”. The exhibition was previously presented in Los Angeles, at the Craft & Folk Art Museum. Drawings, architecture, sculpture, painting, and photography are on show, demonstrating the crossover between the different disciplines.\n\n\n=== The Green Goddess ===\nFrom April 27 to November 3, 2019, the Gare Saint Sauveur is hosting the “La Déesse Verte” exhibition, which draws a parallel between art and nature. A vast greenhouse has been reconstituted and embellished by the works of some twenty artists, who raise issues such as the overexploitation of nature and the effects of the human kingdom on the ecosystem.\n\n\n=== Curiosity ===\nFrom April 27 to July 13, 2019, Lille's natural history museum is exhibiting collections from Mexico City's Museum of Popular Art, referring to Mexico's traditional culture and imaginary world.\n\n\n== Public installations ==\n\n\n=== Alebrijes ===\nIn front of Lille Flandres station, rue Faidherbe, ten large-format alebrijes - statues of half-real, half-fantastic animals from Mexican folklore - have been installed. Installed at the end of April, they will remain there for 8 months until December.\n\n\n=== Calaveras ===\nGiant skulls, or Calaveras, manufactured by an undertaker, have been painted and decorated by Mexican artists and placed around town, mainly in the garden of the Ilot Comtesse.\n\n\n=== Monumental chandelier ===\nDesigned by the Transe Express company, which made its name at the 1992 Albertville Olympic Games, the celestial chandelier is installed in Lille's Grand Palace. Suspended from a crane, it comprises eight branches at the ends of which musicians play, their weight ensuring the stability of the installation. Wind instruments, ground instruments, and frenzied rhythms are on the program, transforming the public square into a ballroom. The suspended orchestra is accompanied by acrobats, who soar several meters high between earth and sky.\n\n\n=== Museum Of The Moon ===\nLocated in the heart of Lille Flandres train station, the Museum Of The Moon is a ten-meter inflatable moon suspended above the ground. It was created by English artist Luke Gerram from NASA lunar images and will be on view until December 2019.\n\n\n=== Soles de Oro ===\nCreated by Mexican visual artist Betsabeé Romero, the Soleils d'or are dozens of mirrors set up in the Old Stock Exchange in the capital of Flanders. Concave in shape and linked together at the height of just a few meters, they produce a variety of light effects, much to the delight of passers-by.\n\n\n=== Retouched fresco ===\nA mural painted as part of Eldorado on a wall in Lille-Moulins, entitled Hydrates toi d'urbaine liqueur, has been strongly criticized by the Alliance police union. The mural depicted three women in Mexican muralist style, one of whom bore the word ACAB (an acronym for All Cops Are Bastards) on her arm, which the artists said referred to the frequent corruption in the Mexican police force. The artists themselves erased the word ACAB in April 1912.\n\n\n=== Counter-festival ===\nElnorpadcado is a counter-festival organized to protest the 2019 Lille 3000 “Eldorado” edition. It ran from April 26 to December 1, 2019. The organizers of this counter-festival are protesting against the gigantism of Lille3000 and its cultural seasons, which in their view are not designed for the people of Lille and Northern France, but to attract an essentially foreign audience: “We're simply saying stop, enough is enough! Since 2004, lille3000 has been proposing huge projects, with excessive communication. At this stage, it's perversion! The festival was triggered by a public outcry against the city's incoherence in proposing these outrageous events, while at the same time implementing a much-criticized concreting plan. One project, in particular, has crystallized all the tensions: the rehabilitation of the Friche Saint-Sauveur, which will be largely concreted over (notably for the construction of a new swimming pool and housing), while the people of Lille have been calling for more green space for years.\nSome players in Lille's cultural life also questioned the Lille 3000 model and its organization. Thomas Werquin, president of Axe Culture, an association that defines itself as a “citizen think tank” in favor of public debate, criticized Lille 3000's disconnection with its territory. In particular, he regrets: \"The festival is not an opportunity to better understand the roots of the people of Lille. For Thomas Werquin, there is a cultural urgency to get to know each other better, which is not that of “parties and glitter”. For him, other cultures should be given pride of place, such as those of the Maghreb and Black Africa, or the Roma. The importance given to Eldorado over the whole of Lille's cultural life has also been criticized: the theme of Mexico is said to have been imposed on Lille's cultural institutions, which are condemned to integrate it in one way or another into their programming, on pain of losing out on subsidies.\n\n\n== Utopia ==\nThe sixth edition of Lille 3000 takes place from May 14 to October 2, 2022, under the name Utopia. It aims to focus on “the links that unite Man with the living. Rather than perpetuating the anthropocentric conception of the world, Utopia will propose the visions of artists, inventors, creators and scientists who question the hierarchy between man and nature“.\n\tWorks presented at Utopia\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cost and economic benefits ==\nLille 3000's annual resources are distributed as follows: the city of Lille finances between €2.3 and €3.2 million, the MEL between €600,000 and €900,000, the Hauts-de-France region €1 million (supported by the French Ministry of Culture and the European Union); and private sponsorship contributes an average of 34% of the association's resources (EDF, Auchan, Caisse d'épargne, AG2R, Air-France, Accor groups). Lille 3000 and its cultural events are an undeniable asset for the image of the city and the metropolis, but the touristic and economic spin-offs are questionable: in Lille's hotels, since the majority of visitors come from the region and the metropolis, the spin-offs are small but not negligible. Museums, on the other hand, see a sharp increase in visitors during the cultural seasons.\nAccording to Médiacités, however, traditional festivals are just as popular with the people of Lille as the Lille 3000 events. Lille 3000 reports 110 million euros in economic spin-offs for the region in connection with its 2015 “Renaissance” event. Based on tourism data and a survey by the Metropole de Lille, the CRC recalculated earnings at around 65 million. However, Lille 3000 is regularly criticized by its opponents for being a commercial or political operation or for costing too much.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLille\nRue Esquermoise\nCitadel of Lille\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDouniès, T.

        "content": "Fotos Tzavelas or Tzavellas (Greek: Φώτος Τζαβέλας/Τζαβέλλας; 1770 - 1809) was a Greek Souliot fighter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Tzavelas family was a well-known clan from the region of Souli in Epirus, who played an important role in the struggles of the Souliotes and during the Greek War of Independence. Fotos Tzavelas was the first-born son of Lambros and Moscho Tzavela. He succeeded his father in the leadership of the Souliotes after the battle of Kiafa and the defeat of Ali Pasha, after which Ali was forced to exchange the hostages that he had held since 1792 with important Albanians who had been captured by the Souliotes. Thus he freed Fotos who returned to Souli, and, after his father's death, the Souliotes elected him their leader. Despite the defeat, Ali Pasha launched new attacks (1800 - 1803) against the Souliotes. The attacks of Ali against the Souliots did not bring any results, in the summer of 1800. That is why Ali decided and built towers in the area around Souli, and besieged the Souliotes with his army. Fotos Tzavelas distinguished himself in these battles for his heroism and leadership skills. He turned out to be a great warlord and showed so much bravery that the Souliotes took oaths \"by the sword of Fotos\". In December 1803, Ali occupied Souli and the Souliotes were forced to disperse. Fotos Tzavelas fled to Parga and then to Corfu, then part of the Septinsular Republic under Russian and Ottoman rule, where, before long, many Souliot clans had taken refuge.\nIn Corfu he served as an officer in the Greek Legion, a military corps created by the Russians, in order to protect the Ionian Islands. Other Souliotes, many klephts, local islanders and volunteers from the mainland of Epirus had joined the Legion.\nIn August 1805 the Greek Legion participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, alongside 14,000 Russian and 10,000 British troops. The expedition was cut short, however, by Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and changing allegiances of the Neapolitan government. In 7 January 1806, the Russians were forced to abandon the Italian mainland to the French. Fotos Tzavelas particularly distinguished himself during this campaign.\nIn 1807 Corfu was occupied by the French. Fotos Tzavelas was designated by the French as a chiliarch in the Albanian Regiment. He died in 1809 from an unknown cause and was buried in the monastery of Panagia Platytera, where his tomb is preserved to this day.\n\n\n== Family ==\nWith his wife, Despo, they had four sons, Nikolaos, Kitsos, Ioannis or Bakatselos and Konstantinos, who lived and took part in the Greek Revolution. He also had a daughter Fotini, who married Gennaios Kolokotronis in 1828. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKallivretakis, Leonidas (2003). \"Ένοπλα Ελληνικά σώματα στη δίνη των Ναπολεοντείων πολέμων (1798-1815)\" [Greek armed corps in the throes of the Napoleonic wars (1798-1815)].

        "content": "The Pulaskian was a short-lived newspaper, published in Pulaski County, Arkansas from 1915 to 1929. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe paper was founded by John C. Small, a resident of the Pulaski Heights neighborhood on the then-outskirts of Little Rock, Arkansas in Pulaski county. Small sold the paper to Parke and Harper Publishers in 1916, one year after starting the publication. The new publishing company was owned by Augustus Winfred Parke and Clio Armitage Harper, with the latter being a prominent citizen and active in many of the other local newspapers of the day. The paper was originally released once per week on Friday, but was moved to Thursday in 1920. The paper focused on local news and legal proceedings, but did have a world focus during World War I.\nWilliam F. Beck, known for his Pea Ridge Pod publication, moved to nearby Maumelle and began writing for the Pulaskian in 1917. Frederick W. Allsopp, another prominent man of Little Rock, noted in his History of the Arkansas Press for a Hundred Years and More in 1922, that Beck's \"The Pod\" drew praise from Puck magazine, The New York Times, and great men, including the president, governors and congressmen.\" Allsopp's book was published by the same company as the Pulaskian, Parke and Harper Publishing.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nToday, copies of the historical newspaper is kept in the University of Arkansas special collections in Fayetteville, Arkansas, available by advance notice only.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Der Marner was a 13th-century itinerant poet and singer in the Middle High German language, whose work is preserved in the Codex Manesse. He was born in Swabia and obviously enjoyed a good school education. He wrote some of his works in the service of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. According to Meister Rumelant, he went blind in old age and was murdered before 1287, probably during the interregnum. \nDer Marner wrote Minnesang (minstrel songs) and later also gnomic poems. He also left behind five Latin poems. His poetry covered a wide range of subjects in addition to minstrelsy: life wisdom, theological and political reflections, riddles and literary feuds, including with Reinmar von Zweter. \n\"Der Marner\" is a nom-de-plume derived from Latin marinarius, that is, \"the mariner\", a fanciful artist's self-designation. His real name is unknown.\nThe poems were first edited by Philipp Strauch (scholar). A more recent edition with modern German translations was made by Eva Willms.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHaustein, Jens (1995). Marner-Studien.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Breakup of Spanish armed forces of July 1936 was the process of decomposition of military and public order formations into two factions: the one which supported the government (loyalists, later called Republicans) and the one which joined the coup (rebels, later called Nationalists). Theoretically there were some 250,000 men serving in various armed branches. However, in fact this figure was probably much closer to 170,000, of which 90,000 served in the military and 80,000 in public order formations; detailed figures advanced by historians differ.\nIn historiography the prevailing opinion is that more armed servicemen joined the rebels than the loyalists; the ratio advanced differs from 59:41 to 52:48, yet there are also scholars who claim that only the minority joined the insurgency. It is usually accepted that slightly more peninsular troops and slightly more public order men remained loyal rather than rebelled, but that the so-called Army of Africa, which in its entirety joined the coup, tilted the balance in favor of the Nationalists.\nNumerical split of manpower between the two warring sides of the Spanish Civil War is by no means indicative as to division of military and combat potential. This is mostly because in the Republican zone the effectives theoretically available were not taken advantage of; many military units were dissolved as potentially rebellious, many officers were detained, many units with few officers and NCOs left turned into loose undisciplined groupings, many rank-and-file servicemen opted for a wait-and-see stance and many later crossed to the Nationalist zone. Also, in early days following the failed coup the military potential of both sides was to a significant extent defined by civilian volunteers.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nThe Spanish military forces were falling into 3 major groups: 1) mainland army, stationed in garrisons in peninsular Spain and on the islands; in numerical terms it was composed mostly of conscripts. Most scholars do not hold these troops in high regard, suggesting poor quality of training, low morale, outdated equipment and officers who often have never seen combat, resembling bureaucrats in uniforms rather than military commanders. These troops were organised into 8 so-called organic divisions, each corresponding to one military region; their theoretical strength is quoted as 110,000-120,000, but in July 1936 there were no more than 70,000 actually in the barracks; 2) army stationed in Africa. It consisted of heterogeneous formations, but mostly of indigenous Moroccan troops and the Foreign Legion, both composed of volunteers. Most of its officers and NCOs saw combat during Rif Wars. African troops were widely considered the best part of the Spanish army; they numbered some 24,500 men in actual service; 3) the navy. In terms of manpower there were some 12,000 people serving in its ranks; the fleet was composed of rather obsolete larger warships and numerous newer destroyers, with some modern cruisers near completion in shipyards. Peninsular and African troops were governed by the Ministry of War; the fleet was governed by the Ministry of Marine. Air force, which technically formed a separate branch, in terms of manpower grouped no more than few thousand men.\n\n\n=== Peninsular army ===\n\nQuesada claims that on paper, there were 120,000 men on the continent and islands in total; Beevor opts for a similar figure of some 110,000. Clifford adheres to the theoretical figure of 120,000, but notes that only 80,000 were actually available. These figures stand no comparison to calculations of military historians, who claim that de facto there were some 65,000 troops in all peninsular garrisons; retrospective analysis of the Francoist staff claimed 60,000. Fairly recent analysis of the Republican army during the civil war, written by Alpert, claims that the total number of troops actually in the barracks in July 1936 was some 65,000. How this mass was split between the Republicans and the Nationalists is unclear, e.g. at times totals advanced by various authors do not match their own sub-totals. Cierva claimed 32,000 Republicans and 19,000 Nationalists (63:37), Nationalist staff had 36,500 Republicans and 23,500 Nationalists (61:39), Quesada claims 33,000 Republicans and 24,000 Nationalists (58:42) and exactly the same figures are given by Turnbull, Beevor settles for 57,000 Republicans and 50,000 Nationalists (53:47), Romero Salvado opts for 35,000 Republicans and 32,000 Nationalists (52:48) and almost exactly the same figures are advanced by Alpert, 34,000 Republicans and 32,000 Nationalists (52:48), while Payne maintains that “less than half” of “fewer than 90,000” rebelled (47,000 Republicans, 38,000 Nationalists?). Some scholars, who accept the figure of 66,000 troops actually in the barracks on the peninsula, settle for general remark that they were “spread roughly equally”. In structural terms, out of 8 divisional commands 3 were controlled by the Republicans (I: Madrid, III: Valencia, IV: Barcelona) and 5 by the Nationalists (II: Sevilla, V: Zaragoza, VI: Burgos, VII: Valladolid, VIII: La Coruña).\n\n\n=== African army ===\n\nSome earlier works, e.g. Salas, claimed that the Army of Africa consisted of some 47,000 troops; also some recent books advance similar figures, e.g. Beevor and Casanova refer to 40,000. However, there was no homogeneous formation known as “Army of Africa” and Spanish Morocco was garrisoned by at least 4 different formations: 1) Foreign Legion, 2) indigenous troops in Spanish service, so-called Regulares, both infantry and cavalry, 3) indigenous troops in service of the sultan and 4) Carabineros, plus 5) minor figures related to navy, air force and policing formations. Already some older studies claimed that there were merely 24.5 thousand troops available to the Nationalists in Morocco, and the figure of 24,741 is advanced also by the recent military analysis. The difference, apart from usual issues related to leaves and outdated documentation, is due to some categories, especially troops in sultan's service, formally not having been under Spanish command and not having been available for shift towards the peninsula. All sources agree, however, that troops brought to Spain from Morocco were the best units in the army, battle-hardened during the Rif Wars, well-equipped and with high combative spirit. Almost all of these 25 thousand men joined the Nationalists, with the exception of some 300 men on leave on the peninsula.\n\n\n=== Navy ===\n\nThough in terms of land forces the potential of Spanish army was rather limited and in numerical terms it was smaller e.g. than the armies of Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia, its navy still ranked as a powerful force to be reckoned with. In Europe it ranked far behind the British and French fleets, but until the early 1930s it was still comparable to the Soviet navy (Europe), German Reichsmarine/Kriegsmarine and the Italian Regia Marina, outclassed only when the latter three embarked on massive investment program. Salas estimated total naval personnel at 20,000, yet contemporary military historians reduce this figure to some 12,000 men. One source claims that 7,000 joined the rebels (with no info either on total or how many remained loyal), the information difficult to reconcile with breakup of the vessels. This, however, is of limited importance; what mattered was the split of warships available. In terms of tonnage, the Republican fleet was double the size of the Nationalist one (some 60,000 tons vs. some 30,000 tons), which was mostly thanks to Nationalist control over 1 battleship (16,000 tons). In terms of the number of warships the Republican advantage was massive: they operated 1 battleship, 3 light cruisers, 14 destroyers and 12 submarines, while the Nationalists operated 1 battleship, 1 light cruiser, 1 destroyer and no submarine. The Republicans controlled all ports along the Bay of Biscay and on the Mediterranean (some 80% of all coastline), while the Nationalists controlled ports in Galicia and on the Atlantic coast of Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Total military ===\n\nAlmost no author provides overall military figures (peninsula + Africa + navy) and in most cases, their suggestions must be ascertained by means of adding sub-totals or applying partial ratio calculations. For Romero Salvado it is 35,000 Republicans vs. 66,000 Nationalists (35:65), for Beevor it is 57,000 Republicans vs. 100,000 Nationalists (36:64), for Quesada it is 33,000 Republicans vs. 53,000 Nationalists (38:62), and for Turnbull it is 33,000 Republicans vs. 48,000 Nationalists (41:59). The narrative by Payne implicitly suggests the same ratio, but somewhat higher figures, namely 47,000 Republicans vs. 68,000 Nationalists (41:59). The officer corps got split fairly evenly; recent military estimates suggest that out of 17,000 officers in total (inc. retired etc.), 8,000 found themselves in the Republican zone and 9,000 in the Nationalist one (47:53). However, in fact only 4,000 supported the loyalists and 13,000 opted for the rebels. Another author claims that out of officers active and in service, 2,000 opted for the Republicans and more than 4,600 for the Nationalists. For NCOs the numbers were 7,500 in the Republican zone and 8,000 in the Nationalist one.\n\n\n== Public order forces ==\n\nApart from regular military, there were 3 other major uniformed and armed formations. None of them was formatted as combat troops, intended to take part in tactical warfare operations. However, they consisted of disciplined men in structured, barracks-based units, trained to perform policing role and to use firearms. The traditional constabulary, operational mostly in rural areas, was Guardia Civil (some 34,000 men). Another traditional service was Carabineros (formally Instituto de Carabineros), operating mostly along the frontiers to prevent smuggling (sources provide figures ranging from 14,000 to 16,000). Relatively new service was Guardia de Asalto (formally Cuerpo de Seguridad y Asalto), set up by the Republic (some 18,000). The Civiles and the Asaltos were subordinated to the Ministry of Interior; the Carabineros formed part of the Ministry of Finance structures. There was no service named “police”. However, there were some specialized armed services, e.g. traffic rules were enforced by Cuerpo de Vigilantes de Caminos. There were also various armed policing services subordinated to local authorities, be it regional or province-specific. Strength of these other units is highly unclear, though they might have amounted to 14,000. Total number of servicemen in all security formations was about 80,000.\n\n\n=== Guardia Civil ===\n\nBy far the largest security formation in Spain was Guardia Civil; in sources its strength is quoted as 32,458, 32,477, 32,860, or 34,320. Its units were scattered evenly across all of the country, though with higher saturation in rural areas and small towns rather than in large urban centres. Its commander, general Sebastián Pozas Perea, was a loyal though not particularly vocal republican. The Civiles had a long-standing reputation of heavy-handed service, and were despised by left-wing supporters as an instrument of reactionary politics. Some sources claim that most of the servicemen joined the rebels; Beevor maintains that merely 40% (which would translate to 13,000-14,000 men) remained loyal. However, academic scholars tend to disagree; according to Tusell some 51% sided with the government, the popular Osprey series by Quesada suggested rather 53% while earlier Osprey work by Turnbull suggested 59%; also the Nationalist staff quoted by Payne estimated the ratio of 59% (20,100). Depending upon the ratio estimated and overall strength assumed, in absolute terms these percentages would translate to some 16,000-20,000 Civiles in the Republican ranks and 13,000-16,000 in the Nationalist ones. There is abundant evidence of Guardia Civil taking part in combat during the July coup, either on the rebel or on the loyalist side. There seems to be no particular pattern emerging, and even in one area local garrisons might have adopted a different stand, e.g. in the Seville province some rebelled (in Ecija), some suppressed the rebellion (in Carmona) and some assumed a wait-and-see position (Osuna).\n\n\n=== Guardia de Asalto ===\n\nSources tend to agree that the Asaltos numbered some 17.5 thousand servicemen (with detailed figure of 17,660 quoted). Since the formation was set up during the early Republic days – at the time it numbered some 4,000 men – it was intended not only as urban police, but also as sort of republican guard, which translated into specific recruitment and vetting procedures. It was partially formatted as riot police, supposed to deal also with urban unrest; the Asaltos were even equipped with armoured vehicles. They were deployed mostly in major urban centres; 6,000 (34% of the total) served in Madrid and Barcelona. All authors agree that Guardia de Asalto remained mostly loyal to the government, either because of republican preferences of its servicemen, or because in large cities the rebels remained hesitant, which prompted these vacillating to side with the prevailing party. Tusell, Payne and other sources agree that some 70% of the Asaltos sided with the loyalists, which in absolute figures would translate to some 12,000 in Republican ranks and some 5,000 in the Nationalist ones. Also Quesada claims 12,000 for the Republicans. Beevor claims that as much as 40% sided with the rebels, which would rather suggest the figures of 11,000 for the Republicans and 7,000 for the Nationalists.\n\n\n=== Carabineros ===\n\nIn literature there is some discrepancy as to the number of Carabineros: some authors claim 14,113 and others claim 16,096. Like in case of Guardia de Asalto, their geographical distribution was highly uneven, this time conditioned not by urbanisation, but by location of Spanish frontiers; they were deployed mostly along the coastline, in northern provinces along the Pyrenean border with France and in western provinces along the border with Portugal. The general inspector of the formation was Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, one of chief military conspirators and later rebel leaders, yet there is no evidence he developed a plot structured in ranks of the service. It rather seems that their choices were conditioned by circumstances; in regions where rebels prevailed (Navarre, Leon) they sided with the Nationalists, in regions with loyalist domination (Catalonia, Extremadura) they supported the government. Payne, Turnbull and Tusell agree that in overall terms most of the Carabineros remained in Republican ranks, though they give the percentage as 65% (some 10,000 men, the figure also explicitly advanced by Quesada), 60% (some 9,000 men) or 59% (also 9,000), which leaves some 4,000-5,000 for the Nationalists. Entirely different split is suggested by Beevor, who maintains that “about two-thirds” opted for rebellion (hence, some 5,000 for the Republicans and some 10,000 for the Nationalists).\n\n\n=== Other armed policing services ===\n\nAlmost all historiographic works ignore minor, local and specialized armed services, and almost none provides any approximation as to their numerical strength. However, when in 1937 the Nationalist general staff estimated composition of both sides back in July 1936, they included the position of “Guardia de Asalto y policía armada”, with the total of 31,200 men. As the number of the Asaltos was 17.6 thousand, this leaves some 13,600 to all other minor specialized formations, like Cuerpo de Vigilantes de Caminos, forest rangers, or prison guards; this figure covers also local policing services, be it regional (Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalonia), provincial (Miqueletes in Gipuzkoa or Miñones in Alava) or municipal (in some cities municipal guards carried firearms). It is not clear how many of them sided with the loyalists and how many joined the rebels. If the Nationalist estimates are considered as point of departure and if the number of Asaltos is accepted as discussed earlier, it seems that some 10,000 remained loyal and some 4,000 opted for insurgency. There is little anecdotic evidence available to provide some examples, yet it is known that some of these servicemen initially took part in combat; e.g. Mossos d'Esquadra protected governmental buildings in Barcelona and Miqueletes engaged against advancing Carlist requetés in defence of their control posts at the border between Gipuzkoa and Navarre.\n\n\n=== Total security formations ===\n\nAll security formations in total are usually estimated to be between some 65,000 and 70,000 men, though these computations do not include local and specialized policing services; when included, the figure might be around 80,000. Totals for both warring factions, which emerge from aggregating specific estimates coming from various authors and related to particular services might differ widely, ranging between 39,000 and 52,000 for the Republicans and between 27,000 and 41,000 for the Nationalists. However, in few cases some authors provide their suggestions for all security services in total, not necessarily in line with their detailed estimates. Beevor claims there were 33,000 for the Republicans and 30,000 for the Nationalists; Payne suggests rather 37,000 vs. 30,000, Quesada maintains 40,000 vs. 30,000, Turnbull 32,000 vs. 21,000, and the Nationalist general staff estimated in 1937 that the figures were 51,000 vs. 29,000. The overall percentage split of security forces which emerges from different sources is (Republicans vs. Nationalists): 64:36 (Nationalist staff, 1937), 61:39 (Turnbull), 60:40 (Tusell), 57:43 (Quesada), 55:45 (Payne) and 52:48 (Beevor).\n\n\n== Armed forces in total ==\n\nIn theory in July 1936 there were some 250,000 men in all Spanish armed forces, both the military and the security formations. On paper, i.e. counting theoretical staff figures related to specific garrisons, some 110,000 were in the Republican zone and 140,000 in the Nationalist one (44:56). Beevor maintains that proportionate advantage of the rebels was even larger and gives the totals of 90,000 in Republican zone and 130,000 in the Nationalist one (41:59). However, some synthetic works might claim the reverse proportion, e.g. according to Casanova out of 250,000 in total, 120,000 opted for the rebels (which implies that 130,000 remained loyal, 52:48). The discrepancy is of little importance, since 250,000 was a largely theoretical figure and the actual number of men under arms was much lower, mostly due to outdated staff documentation, recruitment in progress, and leaves in midst of the summer season.\nRecent study of military historians claims that the figure of “los efectivos realmente operativos” was probably about 167,000, though earlier figures provided by some authors added up even to the record low total of 133,000. The Nationalist general staff estimated in 1937 that with the total of 165,000, the split was 88,000 for the loyalists and 77,000 for the rebels (53:47), which is the unique (along Casanova) statistics claiming the Republicans held numerical advantage. Various sub-totals calculated by Quesada point to the similar total of 158,000, but with exactly the opposite split: 74,000 for the Republicans and 84,000 for the Nationalists (47:53). One eminent historian also claims Nationalist numerical advantage; he opts for the total of 184,000 and for the split of 88,000 vs. 96,000 (48:52). In his later work he is somewhat more vague, but with the similar total of 182,000 and the similar – though implied, not explicitly stated – split of 84,000 Republicans and 98,000 Nationalists (46:54). The smallest overall difference in strength is suggested by Turnbull: 65,000 Republicans and 68,000 Nationalists (49:51).\n\n\n== Tabular summary ==\nThe below table summarises all numerical estimates found in the sources consulted and discussed above. The numbers are in thousands. In most cases there are 2 figures in a cell; one is for the lowest figure identified, and one is for the highest figure identified. Given the discrepancies, it is hardly possible to suggest a \"prevailing\" figure for every category. Also, an attempt to produce an arithmetic \"average\" figure does not seem feasible, given one single extreme estimate might distort the calculation; e.g. five sources give the number of peninsular troops loyal to the government in the range of 32,000—36,000, but there is another one which comes out with the figure of 57,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmy of Africa (Spain)\nCivil Guard (Spain)\nCuerpo de Seguridad y Asalto\nCarabineros (Spain)\nGolpe de Estado de julio de 1936 en la Armada española\nSpanish coup of July 1936\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMichael Alpert, The Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939, Cambridge 2013, ISBN 978-1-107-02873-9\nAlexander Clifford, The People's Army in the Spanish Civil War.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Ariolimax buttoni is a species of banana slug native to the West Coast of the United States.The species has a yellowish-tan hue that is similar to a banana and can be either spotted or unspotted. These slugs tend to be more sedentary but will migrate to find food or reproduce.\n\n\n== Digestion ==\nA. buttoni are foragers that eat dead organic matter. Like most mollusks, these slugs have a mouth on the bottom of their head with a jaw that enables them to break off smaller bits of food. Inside their mouth, they have a tongue called a radula that is covered in microscopic teeth to help break down the food even further. Once the nutrients of the food have been broken down and absorbed, the slug excretes packaged waste through the anus located on the side of its head.\n\n\n== Breathing ==\nLike other banana slugs, A. buttoni has a single lung that aids in gas exchange. To aid in this process the slug has a pnuemostome, a small opening in the head that can close or open depending on the slug's oxygen and water levels.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBanana slugs are hermaphroditic, meaning they are both male and female at the same time. During reproduction, Ariolimax buttoni engages in apophallation - the behavior in which a slug chews off its mating partner's penis.  Their mating season is very long, lasting from February to early September. In addition, the copulation itself is long. In a study conducted by Janet Leonard, data showed that on average the mating process would last up to seven hours with some extreme cases even taking 23. Since the slugs are hermaphroditic, one slug acting as the female would invert its penis for sexual reproduction to take place. However, cross-fertilization is not always necessary. A. buttoni can produce viable offspring with high rates of hatching success through uniparental reproduction.\n\n\n== Movement ==\nAriolimax buttoni moves via a foot on their underside that contracts and relaxes. In addition, they can glide over surfaces by producing a slime layer that aids in combating friction. They tend to be mainly sedentary but will move towards food and mates. Since the slugs have poor vision, they struggle to overcome physical barriers. However, the thick mucus coating on their skin enables them to stick to surfaces and move vertically over obstacles.\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nA. buttoni lives around 30 months. They tend to reach sexual maturity at about one year and lay eggs in the fall or winter. It has been observed that Ariolimax buttoni begins to copulate at as little as 8 months of life.\n\n\n== Defense ==\nAriolimax buttoni does not have shells to defend themselves and their bright color makes them an easy target for predators. However, the slime they produce deters predators from eating them. The mucus coating on their skin is toxic and causes numbing to the mouth of organisms that ingest it. In addition, the thick, sticky slime slows and traps predators from catching up to the slug.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Tournament was the 53rd edition of the NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship, an annual tournament to determine the national champion of NCAA Division I and Division II men's collegiate indoor volleyball. The single-elimination tournament, which was expanded to eight teams with the addition of the SIAC Champion getting an auto-bid, began with four quarterfinal matches. The entire tournament was hosted by Long Beach State University from April 30 to May 4, 2024, at the Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, California.\nThe quarterfinals and semifinals were streamed live on NCAA.com. The National Championship was moved from ESPN2 to ESPN and took place on May 4 with ESPN+ simulcasting it.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the SIAC was granted a waiver to be allowed an automatic bid despite not meeting the two-year eligibility waiting period requirement. The SIAC was granted the bid because the conference had been fostering growth and diversity in a region that has had little representation in men's volleyball.\nWith Fort Valley State University receiving the automatic bid for the SIAC conference, the school made history as the first HBCU to compete in the NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship.\nOf note, the quarterfinals featured a sweep in every game, the first such occurrence since the 2013 NCAA Men's Volleyball Tournament, albeit an important difference being that the field was much smaller back then (4 compared to 8).\nWith UCLA winning it's 21st title, it's the first time the school has repeated as champions since the 1995-1996 seasons. Likewise, their win marks the sixth school in a row to repeat as champions, starting with UC Irvine's repeat wins in the 2012-2013 seasons. Ironically, John Speraw, who just won back-to-back titles with UCLA also won with UC Irvine in 2012 season, before leaving to coach at UCLA in 2013.\n\n\n== Bids ==\nThe tournament field was announced on NCAA.com Sunday, April 21, 2024, at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\nAll times Pacific.\n\n\n== All Tournament Team ==\nHilir Henno, UC Irvine\nCamden Gianni, Grand Canyon University\nSkyler Varga, Long Beach State\nSimon Torwie, Long Beach State\nAndrew Rowan, UCLA\nMerrick McHenry, UCLA\nEthan Champlin, UCLA (Most Outstanding Player)\n\n\n== References ==",

Murphy said, \"Everybody else was a Sinatra freak, but I was a Nat King Cole freak...He was like rhythmic honey\". Murphy said that Cole delivered, \"the loosest, slipperiest vocals in the world\". This album is a continuation of Mark Murphy Sings the Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume One and the tracks were recorded at the same sessions.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nThe tracks were recorded in two sessions in October and November of 1983 with Murphy and Steve Zegree producing. Each tune is recorded as a duet with a single instrument, either bass, piano or guitar. Murphy was attracted to the challenge of having his voice so very exposed in this rather stark approach to the songs. Michael Bourne wrote in the liner notes, \"Murphy's voice, always a spectacular instrument in itself, is called upon to be even more virtuosic than ever\". Murphy said the recording was a tribute, not a copy, \"to my first influence, and to Nat's taste. Of course he could make everything sound good, but he also picked such wonderful songs\". Murphy decided to record many lesser known songs associated with Cole, and avoided many of his bigger hits.\nBob Magnusson, who appeared with Murphy on Bop for Kerouac, accompanies on bass on two tracks (2, 8). The pianist and guitarist had not previously recorded with Murphy. Gary Schunk accompanies on piano on three tracks (1, 3, 6).  And Murphy is accompanied by guitarist Joseph LoDuca on four tracks (4, 5, 6, 9).\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nScott Yanow assigns 3 stars to this release in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz. He said, \"It would have been nice if all of the musicians could have played together a bit, but the strong material and Murphy's interpretive skills hold one's interest throughout...Murphy mostly avoided the obvious hits, opting for particularly strong material that fits his chance-taking style\". \nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones said the recordings for Volume 2 were \"more accessible\" than Volume 1.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Portrait of Jennie / Ruby\" (J. Russel Robinson, Gordon Burdge / Heinz Roemheld, Mitchell Parish) – 5:01\n\"Walkin' My Baby Back Home / Breezin' Along With the Breeze\" (Fred Ahlert, Roy Turk / Haven Gillespie, Seymour Simons, Richard A.

        "content": "\"Young Morgan\" (Roud 5369, also known as \"The Flying Highwayman\") is an English folk ballad. It is part of a tradition of positive highwayman ballads, and portrays Morgan (who is only known from this song) as a hero who does not rob the poor.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe song appears in two broadside ballads. The earliest version, \"The Flying Highwayman\" is undated, but is estimated to be from around 1750. Unlike later versions, it ends with Morgan being pardoned by the king. The second, \"Young Morgan\", is dated to the early nineteenth century, and omits the first and last verses.\nAccording to John Wardroper, the song was very popular, and led to a sequel being written, in which Morgan, after being pardoned, travels to France where he uses a black pudding as a fake pistol, and becomes a successful highwayman.\nTwo verses, from a version where the highwayman was hanged at Tyburn, were remembered by Walter Sholto Douglas, who heard a young Romani woman singing the ballad around 1801:\n\nPhoebe Smith sang two verses of the song to Mike Yates in 1975/76. She said her brother had learned it from an old man who knew someone that had been present at the highwayman's execution. These verses were recorded, and included in her album The Yellow Handkerchief (2001):\n\nMartin Carthy heard Phoebe Smith's recording, and wrote his own version, based on this and the \"Young Morgan\" broadside ballad. He included the song on his album Waiting for Angels (2004).\nThe folk group Duck Soup performed \"Young Morgan\" for their album Open on Sundays (2010), sung by Dan Quinn.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoung Morgan (Roud 5369) at Broadside Ballads Online",

        "content": "Wardour Street is the upcoming studio album by English rock band The Quireboys. It is scheduled to be released on 13 September 2024 through Cadiz Music. The album is named after Wardour Street, a prominent street in London's Soho district known for its music venues and historic significance to the UK rock scene.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWardour Street is the first Quireboys album after the band splintered in early 2022. Frontman Spike was fired from the band, leaving Guy Griffin as lead vocalist. In May 2022, Spike announced his reunion with former Quireboys members Guy Bailey and Nigel Mogg.\nOn 9 December 2022, newly formed group released a two-track single, \"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\", in support of Care After Combat, a charity for British combat veterans. The album's lead single, \"Jeeze Louise\", was released on 31 October 2023. The release of Wardour Street was originally announced for spring, coinciding with a UK tour in May 2024, with guitarist Luke Morley from Thunder performing in place of Guy Bailey, who had died in April 2023. The release date was later pushed back to 13 September.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mark Murphy Sings the Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume One is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nMark Murphy Sings the Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume One is the 21st album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 51 years old in 1983 and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1985. This album is collection of songs associated with Nat King Cole. Murphy received his third Grammy Award nomination for his performance.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1983 Murphy decided to record a tribute album to his teenage idol Nat King Cole. Murphy said, \"Everybody else was a Sinatra freak, but I was a Nat King Cole freak...He was like rhythmic honey\". Murphy said that Cole delivered, \"the loosest, slipperiest vocals in the world\". Murphy wrote in the liner notes, \"This Nat King Cole Songbook is dedicated to his daughter Natalie and brother Freddie - two fabulous singers - but mostly to the memory of Nat's A&R man at Capitol Records, Lee Gillette. Lee was also a founding member of NARAS\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\nThe tracks were recorded in two sessions in October and November of 1983 with Murphy and Steve Zegree producing. Each tune is recorded as a duet with a single instrument, either bass, piano or guitar. Murphy was attracted to the challenge of having his voice so very exposed in this rather stark approach to the songs. Murphy said the recording was a tribute, not a copy, \"to my first influence, and to Nat's taste. Of course he could make everything sound good, but he also picked such wonderful songs\". Murphy decided on many lesser known songs associated with Cole, and avoided many of his bigger hits.\nBob Magnusson, who appeared with Murphy on Bop for Kerouac, accompanies on bass on three tracks (1, 6, 8). The pianist and guitarist had not previously recorded with Murphy. Gary Schunk accompanies on piano on four tracks (3, 5, 9, 10).  And Murphy is accompanied by guitarist Joseph LoDuca on three tracks (2, 4, 7).\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nScott Yanow assigns 4 stars to the album in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz. He said, \"It would have been nice if all of the musicians could have played together a bit, but the strong material and Murphy's interpretive skills hold one's interest throughout...Murphy mostly avoided the obvious hits, opting for particularly strong material that fits his chance-taking style\". \nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones singles out \"These Foolish Things\" as \"one of the most affecting songs on the album\".\nMurphy was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards for his performance on Mark Murphy Sings Nat's Choice – The Nat \"King\" Cole Songbook Volume I. He lost to Bobby McFerrin and Jon Hendricks for Another Night in Tunisia. \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Nature Boy / Calypso Blues\" (Eden Ahbez / Nat King Cole, Don George) – 5:56\n\"Love Letters / Serenata\" (Victor Young, Edward Heyman / Leroy Anderson, Mitchell Parish) – 3:39\n\"Oh You Crazy Moon\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) – 3:38\n\"’Tis Autumn\" (Henry Nemo) – 4:13\n\"I Keep Goin’ Back To Joe's\" (Marvin Fisher, Jack Segal) – 4:18\n\"Tangerine\" (Victor Schertzinger, Johnny Mercer) – 3:50\n\"Lush Life\" (Billy Strayhorn) – 4:22\n\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along / Baby, Baby All the Time\" (Sammy Cahn, Saul Chaplin, L.E.

        "content": "Gaius Julius Asper was a Roman politician and senator in the third century AD.\nAsper came from the city of Attalia in Asia Minor. He was promoted to a high position in the Senate due to his learning and intellect. During the reign of Commodus, Asper served as suffect consul. In 204 AD, Asper was appointed as Proconsul of Africa. In 212 AD, he served as consul together with his son, Gaius Julius Camilius Asper. At the same time he was consul, Asper also was Urban Prefect of Rome.\nHowever, in that same year, Asper fell out of favor and was exiled along with his son on the orders of Caracalla. Later, he was pardoned and appointed Proconsul of Asia in 217 AD, but the new emperor Macrinus revoked this appointment, citing Asper's old age and illness, installing Quintus Anicius Faustus in his stead.\nAsper was a Priest of the Flamens and the Salii.\n\n\n== References ==",

On 29 April 2024, Waller was appointed as the second ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. As he is celibate, he will be consecrated as a bishop. He was formerly a priest in the Church of England before converting to Catholicism in 2011.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in London, England, he was educated at St David and St Katharine Church of England Secondary School in Hornsey, London, and the College of Ripon and York St John. Having been a community worker in Bradford, he then trained for Anglican ministry at Chichester Theological College, an Anglo-Catholic theological college.\n\n\n== Church of England ==\nWaller was ordained a Church of England deacon in 1991 and as a priest in 1992. He served in the Diocese of Chichester as a curate (1991–1995) and then as team vicar of Crawley (1995–2000). He then served as vicar of the Parish of St Saviour, Walthamstow, in the Diocese of Chelmsford from 2000 until he left the Church of England to join the Roman Catholic Church.\nIn addition to his parish ministry, he was a member of the House of Clergy in the General Synod of the Church of England from 2005 to 2010.\n\n\n== Roman Catholic Church ==\nOn 24 April 2011, Waller officially converted from Anglicanism to the Roman Catholic Church. He was ordained as Catholic deacon on 14 May 2011 and as a priest on 11 June 2011, both times by Thomas McMahon, Bishop of Brentwood. He was parochial administrator of St John the Baptist church, Ilford, from 2011 to 2015, and then parish priest of Christ the King, Chingford, from 2015 to 2024. In 2020, he was additionally appointed vicar general of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham by its ordinary, Keith Newton.\nOn 29 April 2024, it was announced that Pope Francis had appointed Waller as the next ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. Waller is celibate and will therefore be consecrated as a bishop: his predecessor Newton was married and therefore ineligible for the episcopate. Waller will also be the first bishop of any of the three personal ordinariates that has served as an ordinariate priest rather than being an external appointment. His episcopal consecration is due to take place on 22 June 2024 at Westminster Cathedral with Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández as the principal consecrator.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rosabel Grace Watson (September 1865 – 5 October 1959) was an English conductor, theatre music director and all-round musician. She was the founder of the first all-female orchestra in the UK.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nWatson became interested in music by regularly attending the August Manns concerts at Crystal Palace in the late 1870s. In 1880 she began her professional training at the Guildhall School of Music, studying piano with Lindsay Sloper.  She was described in Etude Magazine as \"a first-rate all-round musician and a most capable conductor. She is the best woman horn-player in England, and plays the piano and all the stringed instruments extremely well, especially the double bass\".\nAfter graduating Watson was active as a soloist and chamber music musician from the early 1880s. She taught music in schools and composing and conducting theatre music. She performed in and arranged concerts at venues including The People's Palace and Toynbee Hall. With her friend the pianist Anne Mukle she worked on philanthropic music and drama productions in one of the poorest areas of London, Bethnal Green.\nIn 1911 she was appointed director of music at the Institute School of Music in Hampstead Garden Suburb (founded by social reformer Henrietta Barnett), until it closed down at the outbreak of war in 1914. Henry Wood was president of the school and lectures were given there by Gustav Holst, Frank Bridge and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Cellist May Mukle (sister of Anne and a member of the Aeolian Orchestra) was on the teaching staff.\n\n\n== Aeolian Ladies' Orchestra ==\n\nIn 1886 Watson founded the Aeolian Ladies’ Orchestra, said to have been the first all-female orchestra in the UK. In her years on the concert circuit she had already worked with many of the leading female musicians of the day, including violinist Kitty Althaus, oboist Leila Bull, the Chaplin sisters (Nellie, Kate and Mabel), Clara Farrow (horn), Catherine Fidler (trumpet), Anna Lang (violin), Constance Moss (trombone), the Mukle sisters (Lilian, Anne and May), Lucy Mumby (bassoon), flautists Anita Paggi and Edith Penville, Beatrice Pettit (cornet) and clarinetist Frances Thomas.\nThe orchestra, which flourished in the 1890s and still performed occasionally over the following two decades, employed many of these and other female students and scholars who had trained at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music and Guildhall School of Music. The orchestra toured nationally - including engagements at the Royal Albert Hall (1896) and in Dublin, and also played at many suffrage gatherings.\nOther women only orchestras of this era included the English Ladies' Orchestral Society, the Haresfoot Ladies' Band, the Lady William Lennox's Orchestra and Mrs. Hunt's Ladies' Orchestra.\n\n\n== Theatre music ==\nWatson became an authority on incidental music for the theatre, mostly, but not exclusively Shakespeare. She frequently worked in Stratford at the Royal Shakespeare Company as a music director, from 1916 up until around 1944, often with Donald Wolfit and also with William Poel and the Elizabethan Stage Society. She selected, arranged and sometimes composed the incidental music as well as conducting, though the extent of her contribution is not always clear. For the 1925 production of King John, for instance, the surviving score and parts do not name any composer. Typically she is credited as musical director and/or arranger.\nShe also worked between 1933 and 1953 at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre under Robert Atkins, who was in charge there from 1932 until 1961. For instance, she directed the music for Twelfth Night (1934) and the 1937 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream (using Mendelssohn's music) featuring Leslie French as Bottom and Fay Compton as Titania. She also conducted elsewhere, such as the Ballet Rambert's performances at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge in December 1943.\n\n\n== Final years ==\nWatson continued to work regularly into her old age. One of the last theatre music performances she is credited with was a July 1956 production of Twelfth Night at the Open Air Theatre. Watson died in London on 5 October 1959 at the age of 94. Her papers, including original manuscripts, are held at the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin, among the papers of the actor Chris Castor and her husband Donald Wolfit.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sibyllenort Palace (German: Schloss Sibyllenort or Polish: Pałac Sybilli) is a former palace in Szczodre, 12 kilometres north-east of Wrocław, Silesia, Poland. It was first the seat of the dukes of Oels, and later the private property of the royal Saxon family. Due to its Tudor style, it was known as the Silesian Windsor. It was destroyed in the last days of the Second World War, by soldiers of either the retreating SS or the Red Army (or both).\nToday, only individual remnants of buildings and the vast, largely overgrown park bear witness to the once grand and representative castle complex.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== House of Württemberg-Oels ===\n\nThe villages of Neudorf and Rastelwitz belonged to the Gaffron family since 1592, with Rastelwitz lying deserted since the Thirty Years' War. In 1685, Balthasar Wilhelm von Gaffron sold them to Christian Ulrich I, Duke of Württemberg-Oels (1652–1704) . From 1685 to 1692, he constructed a summer residence there for his second wife, princess Sibylle Maria of Saxony-Merseburg (1667–1694), after whom he named both the town and the palace, Sibyllenort. The palace consisted of 13 axles with a French garden and was surrounded by a moat.\nChristian Ulrich's son, Charles Fredrick II (1690–1761), gifted the palace to his wife, Sibylle Charlotte Juliane of Württemberg (1690–1735), in 1712, who initially leased the property. After the palace was deemed uninhabitable, Sibylle Charlotte renovated it in 1716 and used it as a summer residence until her death in 1735. It then passed to her sister, Hedwig Friederike of Anhalt-Zerbst (1691–1752), before reverting back to the dukes of Württemberg-Oels.\nPolish kings and Saxon electors Augustus II the Strong (1670–1733) and Augustus III of Poland (1696–1763) visited Sibyllenort, when travelling between their capitals Dresden and Warsaw.\nCharles Frederick II's successor and brother, Charles Christian (1716–1792), paid little attention to the palace. He was the last of his line. His daughter, Friederike Sophie Charlotte Auguste (1751–1789), was married to prince Frederick Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1740–1805), son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1713–1780). This prince became the inheritor of Schloss Sibyllenort.\n\n\n=== Duke of Brunswicks: duke Frederick Augustus ===\nIn 1792, the duchy of Oels was granted to prince Frederick Augustus. He preferred Sibyllenort over the Oels castle in Oleśnica. He significantly renovated and expanded Sibyllenort from 1792 to 1805. The main building was raised with an additional floor, the main facade received projecting bay windows, and two domed round towers were added on the courtyard side. Additionally, four outbuildings were constructed, including a theatre. The gardens were designed by Christian Weiss. Joseph von Eichendorff visited the palace in 1803 and praised the combination of luxury and taste.\nWhen duke Frederick August died, the duchy and the Sibyllenort palace went to his nephew, Frederick William (1771–1815), who inherited the Duchy of Brunswick as well.\n\n\n==== Gallery: Sibyllenort in the time of duke Frederick Augustus ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Duke of Brunswicks: duke William ===\n\nFrom 1824 onwards, it was owned by the last Duke of Oels, William, Duke of Brunswick (1806–1884). In 1829, he hosted at Sibyllenort the Russian tsar Nicholas I and his wife, Charlotte of Prussia.\nBetween 1851 and 1857, duke William, under the direction of architect Carl Wolf, rebuilt and significantly expanded the palace complex in the style of Windsor Castle in the British Tudor style, comprising 400 rooms. The length of the palace was 300 metres, of which the frontal façade was 100 metres long. East of the newly integrated corps de logis, a new economic wing was built, as well as a glazed orangery. Simultaneously, a 75-hectare English landscape park with several ponds and a wild game reserve of over 200 hectares were created. It was possible to visit the park and 60 representative rooms with a large collection of 5,000 prints and paintings, and Meissen porcelain, making the palace a popular tourist attraction. The theatre within the palace featured actors from Wrocław and a professional ballet from Brunswick.\nWilliam made Sibyllenort his main residence and died there on 18 June 1884, unmarried and without legitimate heirs. He bequeathed Sibyllenort to his nephew, Albert, King of Saxony (1828–1902). The duchy of Oels itself returned to the Prussian crown. The Oels castle became one of the residences of the Prussian crown prince.\n\n\n==== Gallery: Introduction of the Tudor style by duke William ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Saxon royal family ===\nKing Albert of Saxony used Sibyllenort as a summer residence. Under Albert, the theatre was converted into a chapel, the palace received water and sewage systems, and the large fountain in front of the main facade was installed. Also, there were other improvements like importing a marble altar from Venice and covering the dining room walls with embossed leather depicting ancient scenes.\nThe Archduchess Louise of Austria (1870–1947), consort of the last King of Saxony,  Frederick Augustus III (1865–1932), recounts the following about Sibyllenort Castle in her memoirs:\n\"In the summer of 1902 we were in the country, but our usually pleasant holiday was clouded by the serious condition of King Albert, who was on the point of death. The King and Queen were staying at the Castle of Sibyllenort near Breslau (Wrocław) in Silesia, a beautiful residence given by the last Duke of Brunswick to the then King of Saxony. The castle contains four hundred rooms, and it was the scene of many scandalous orgies in the later forties. The Duke, who was a great admirer of the fair sex, had a private theatre there, and the ballet was composed of numerous pretty girls, whom he kept in harem-like seclusion. I remember seeing some rather startling pictures when I visited the castle as a girl of sixteen, but these were very properly banished by Queen Carola's orders, and Sibyllenort became a highly decorous royal residence.\"\nAfter the abdication of the king Frederick Augustus III in 1918, Sibyllenort became his permanent residence. He died there in 1932. During this time, a unique collection of Meissen porcelain was assembled.\nHis heir, Frederick Christian of Saxony (1893–1968), could not afford to maintain the huge building. This leaded to a large part of the interior furnishings being auctioned off in 1935.And the remainder of the furniture was transferred to Frederick Christian's newly built Wachwitz Palace in Dresden. The library went to the University of Breslau. A wing of the palace was converted into apartments, but no concept for its overall use was found.\n\n\n==== Gallery: A tour of the Sibyllenort palace interior in the time of king Frederick Augustus III ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nFrom 1939, the palace buildings were used as a Luftwaffe main depot.\nOn 26 January 1945, as the Red Army approached, the central building of the palace was blown up, resulting in the entire building burning down. This was done either by retreating soldiers of the Wehrmacht or looting soldiers of the Red Army.\n\n\n=== Communist Poland ===\n\nThe last royal owner was prince Fredrick Christian. When Silesia came under Polish administration after World War II, Schloss Sibyllenort and its estate were confiscated.\nIn the People's Republic of Poland, the still usable parts of the buildings were used by the State Security Service, including as a recreational centre for officials. After extensive renovation from 1977 to 1980, the preserved part of the east wing became a training centre for employees of the Lower Silesia Voivodeship and the city of Wrocław.\nSimultaneously, demolition of the ruins began in the 1950s, with interruptions until 1989. Neo-gothic buildings were stigmatized as they clearly had German origins. Initially, buildings built after 1850 were not entered in the monument register at all. The stones were partly used for the reconstruction of cities destroyed during the war, like Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nIn the contemporary period, the remnants of the palace complex, including the palace wing, outbuilding, park with a forest, and a walled fence with a gate, were listed as historic monuments in 1990. Since 1988, the palace wing has remained unused, while former State Agricultural Farm employees reside in the outbuilding. In 1992, the property was sold to a private company, and in 2001, it passed into private ownership. In 1999, the iron lion sculptures from the entrance gate went missing.\n\n\n== Modern remnants ==\n\nStill existing structures in 2015 included:\n\nA fragment of the eastern wing – brick-built, two-story, in the style of English neo-Gothic, two-winged with two corner octagonal towers, three and four-axis with a roof hidden behind an attic with battlements;\nA fragment of the theatre building (currently a residential house) – brick-built, two-story, in the style of English neo-Gothic, built on a square plan, three-axis with a flat roof hidden behind an attic, with a projecting bay on the front facade with a stepped gable;\nThe palace park – in the English style, covering an area of 9.75 hectares, with a horseshoe-shaped pond covering an area of 1 hectare, with a group of weeping willows;\nLandscape-botanical garden (currently a forest) – covering an area of 75 hectares, ponds covering an area of 10 hectares, within which there are monumental trees – ginkgo biloba and pedunculate oaks;\nSouth gate (formerly topped by iron lions) – brick-built, stone-faced, consisting of four pillars on a plinth crowned with an arcaded frieze with crenelations;\nWest gate (formerly topped by iron lions) – brick-built, stone-faced, consisting of four pillars on a plinth crowned with visible heraldic shields;\nPark keeper's house (currently abandoned) – brick-built, single-story, in the shape of the letter T, with a gable roof covered with fish-scale tiles with wide eaves, some windows with triangular pediments framed with decorative lintels;\nPark keeper's house (currently abandoned) – brick-built, single-story, in the shape of the letter L, with a gable roof covered with tiles with wide eaves, some windows with triangular pediments, common decorative lintel; and\nGame reserve (currently forest) – covering an area of 200 hectares.\nIn the former park there is also a memorial cross for King Albert, which his wife Carola (1833–1907) had erected after his death.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSieber, Helmut (1957).

        "content": "Battles for Prehoryłe fought between Polish Partisan forces and German-Ukrainian forces, skirmishes took place over months in the village of Prehoryłe\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nAfter the massacre of Polish civilians in 1943, there were growing fears of a repetition of the events in Volhynia. So Poles organised self-defences as in the villages located between the Bug River and the strip of villages Bereść. The conflict escalated after that .in villages located between the Bug River and the strip of villages: Uchanie, Bereść, Hostynne, Werbkowice, Wronowice, Miętkie, Telatyn, Chodywańce. In these villages, to increase the effectiveness of the UNS troops, bunkers were built and trenches dug. However, in January there were only isolated mutual assaults, with a few casualties on both sides. Also from Volhynia, a throng of Polish people who were fleeing the terror began to arrive.\nThe course of events was sharper in the Hrubieszów area, where, on the initiative of the commander of the Hrubieszów District of the AK under Antoni Rychel, pseud. \"Anio³\", Poles acted simultaneously against the Ukrainian intelligentsia and those Ukrainians who, after the attack of the USSR on Poland, sided with the Soviets. The latter were denounced to the Hrubieszów Gestapo. Against the first group, the tactic of attacks on pre-designated persons was used. By June 1943 alone, 150 people had been liquidated in this way. Polish units (a detachment of Battalion of Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\"\nIn view of the development of the situation, the Zamojski Inspectorate of the Home Army decided to evacuate the Polish civilian population to the districts of Bilgoraj, Zamojski, Chelm, Krasnostawski and the western part of Tomaszowski, to strengthen Polish self-defence in the remaining area and to launch a coordinated attack on the area occupied by the Ukrainians. At the beginning of March, the evacuation plan was launched, but was only partially carried out due to the reluctant attitude of the Polish population\n\n\n== Battles ==\n\n\n=== First Battle ===\nIn April 1943, another defence of Malkov against the onslaught of Ukrainian nationalists. The battle in the village of Prehoryłe ended with the victory of the Polish self-defence, the Upovars did not manage to take the well-defended Holubia.\n\n\n=== Second Battles ===\n\nFor the following months, the village was quiet, until the forces of the Home Army and the Peasant Battalions began fierce fighting with the local UPA forces. The Ukrainian forces then began to take up arms against the Poles with the Germans. Skirmishes were reported in Małków, where the forces of the Rysia Battalion under the command of Karol (Kaczała) defeated Ukrainian forces. This was not the end of the successes, the Battle of Zablocie was fought next, which brought Stanislaw Basaj fame. On 17 February the Germans directed their own and Ukrainian forces to Prehoryłe, but without success; fortunately, the forces of the Peasant Battalions arrived on time and gave an idea of why the Rysia battalion is considered not to have been defeated.\n\n\n=== Third Battle ===\nOn 5 March, a clash with the Ukrainian SS Galizien and Ortschutz was recorded, in which 1 BCh soldier was killed and 1 wounded. When, on 9 March, two AK battalions under the command of Stefan Kwaśniewski and Zenon Jachymek took action against the Ukrainians with a broad front from Prehoryłe to Sahryń, initially the BCh units did not take part in the battle, except for a small detachment that served as a guide in the vicinity of Modryń. However, as the action unfolded, BCh units joined the action on the eastern wing of the battle, where Stefan Kwaśniewski was in command. I am writing more about this because Wojciech Sulewski in his publications attributes the whole of this battle to the 'Rysia' battalion, which is not true.\n\n\n=== Fourth Battle ===\nOn 8.III.1944, the combined detachments of the Galizien-SS, the Ostschutz from Szychowice and Holubia and the UPA units from across the Bug River, supplying the local \"Striltsiv\" from Holubia, attacked the mixed Polish-Ukrainian village of Prehoryłe at dawn. It was adjacent on the eastern side - the flowing Bug River - to the Kryłów-Hołubie (now Golubie) route. The attackers burned and murdered the Polish population. The BCh platoons of \"Rysia\", who were quartered closest to Prehoryły, decided to come to the aid of the murdered population. A fierce battle ensued and the enemy troops were driven out, partly.Some went to Holubia, others to Bug and still others to Szychowice. This action is called name in partisan nomenclature - Prehoryłe I.\nOn the second day: on 9.III.1944, around 11 a.m., an alarm was raised in Górka. From the direction of Prehory one could hear the rustling of machine gun series and single rifles. Still in the morning soldiers of \"Rysia\" in the strength of 2 platoons under the general command of \"Bruchalski\" (Feliks Dzygala), went to Prehoryłe burnt the day before, as a protection of the team that was to bury murdered Poles.\nAnd then an attack by UPA forces came from Holubia. A second battle broke out. This battle is called - Prehoryłe II, on 9.III.1944. To help the forces of \"Bruchalski\" rushed the platoon of \"Szczygiel\" (Feliks Zwolak). When the platoon reached Prehoryłe, the action was already coming to an end. After setting fire to a shed, \"Bruchalski\" managed to leave the encirclement under cover of smoke. The participation of our platoon came down to the fact that it thwarted the pursuit of \"Bruchalski's\" retreating partisans. The Uprising's men, seeing that the Poles were with the help of new forces, they abandoned the pursuit.\n\n\n== Aftermatch ==\nThis was followed by preparations for the Hrubish Revolution, these victories were of great significance as they discouraged the UPA forces from continuing to fight hard for every scrap of land.\n\nAfter the action on Prehoryłe II (day), the platoon of \"Szczygła\" returned to temporary quarters in the part of the unburned Gorki. In the evening everyone was electrified by the news that on the night of 9/10 III.1944 the following were to be liquidated: Sahryń, Turkowice, Szychowice Łasków. Sahryń, Turkowice,Malice and the like. were to be done by units from the Tomaszów Lubelski district, specifically the AK Battalion of Tomaszów \"Wiktor\" (Zenon Jachymek). It was to be supported by BCH platoons: ,,Leaf\" (Antoni Furmaga), ,Visa\" (Tomasz Flis) and Moscow - these two platoons (the latter two) still belonged to the AK at the time - of the Hrubieszów \"Wiktor\" (Stefan Kwaśniewski). In Sahryń the Independent Modrin Section of Henryk Ratyna, from the composition of the 4th platoon of \"Szczygiel\" of the 1st Battalion of the BCH \"Rysia\", took part. At the same time the combined forces of the BCh and AK of the Hrubieszów district, i.e. the 1st Battalion of the Hrubieszów Division of the BCh \"Rysia\" and the 5th Battalion of the AK \"Wiktor\", were to strike at the base of the Ortschutz and the \"SS\" from the Galizien-SS in Szychowice and the USN-UPA base in Łasków-village.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Travis County Corrections Bureau encompasses two correctional facilities managed by the Travis County Sheriff's Office in Travis County, Texas: the Travis County Jail, a central booking facility in downtown Austin, and the Travis County Correctional Complex in Del Valle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first jail in Travis County was authorized in 1847 and constructed on what is now known as the Old Courthouse block of downtown Austin. When this facility was destroyed by a fire in 1855, a new jail was built on the site the following year. This iteration of the jail and county courthouse lasted until 1906.\nA new county jail was constructed on the intersection of 11th Street and Brazos Street, near the new courthouse on 11th Street and Congress Avenue. These facilities lasted until 1931, when the State of Texas offered Travis County land for a courthouse to break its existing lease for the courthouse and jail. The resulting Travis County Courthouse is still in use today, but the courthouse jail closed in 1990 due to a 1972 lawsuit which deemed a jail above a county courthouse unconstitutional.\nA bond for a new jail was passed in 1978, and the new jail opened in July 1986. Because of overflow, a new facility with a capacity of 96 inmates was established in Del Valle, Texas. Now known as the Travis County Correctional Complex, the Del Valle facilities have expanded to a capacity of 2,300 inmates.\nA plan for separate women's facilities at the Travis County Correctional Complex was proposed in 2016, but scrapped by 2021. \nIn 2023, the Travis County Commissioner's Court approved  a pilot diversion center as an alternative to jail for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. The program began operations in early 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The depiction of bicycles on stamps began in 1899 with a Cuban special delivery stamp, although unofficial (local or cinderella) issues had been previously released in Germany (1887/8), in the United States (1894), and in Australia (1896). The number of bicycle-related postal items (stamps, postal stationery, etc.) exceeds 30,000 as of 2024. As a thematic topic, bicycles are notable for the wide variety of subjects that they are used to illustrate.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe definition of what constitutes a bicycle stamp is open to interpretation. A bicycle stamp has one or more of the following characteristics:\n\nIt depicts a human-powered cycling machine. This includes a whole (or part of) bicycles, tricycles, unicycles, toy cycles, tandems, rickshaws, exercise/standing bicycles, etc. It excludes powered or unpowered wheelchairs and motor-driven or motor-assisted cycling machines, e.g. motorcycles, mopeds.\nIt depicts a bicycle or cyclist in a social context. For example, a cyclist in a street scene, cycling as an energy-efficient, green, mode of transport, or cycling promoting road safety.\nIt depicts a building used specifically for cycling sport, i.e. a velodrome.\nIt depicts a person notable for being a cyclist, e.g. a winner of the Tour de France, or cycling events at the Olympic Games.\nIt depicts the process of manufacturing a bicycle, or a notable bicycle manufacturer (individual or firm).\nIt depicts the word \"bicycle\" in the local language, even if the image of a bicycle is not included. The word triathlon without an image of a bicycle is excluded.\nThe following types of material are excluded (although they may also be collected by bicycle stamp enthusiasts):\n\nPostal stationery, e.g. a postcard depicting a bicycle with a non-bicycle stamp affixed.\nCinderella, local, private or personal issues, i.e. unofficial stamps.\nNon-postal stamps, e.g. revenue stamps such as the French 1940s \"Impôt sur les vélocipèdes\".\nStamps issued by non-existing/unrecognized countries and/or in excess of actual postal requirements.\n\n\n== Early issues ==\nThe first bicycle stamp of the 20th century was a 1900 stamp issued for local postal delivery during the siege of Mafeking, depicting Cadet Sgt. Major Goodyear on a bicycle. The United States issued a special delivery bicycle messenger stamp in 1902. Bulgaria issued a cycling stamp as part of a set commemorating the Balkan games of 1931. In 1935 the USSR issued a bicycle stamp to commemorate the World Spartacist Games. Denmark issued a stamp showing King Christian X on horseback as part of his silver jubilee celebrations in 1937; in the background of the street scene are three cyclists.\nThese early issues illustrate the wide variety of subjects depicted on bicycle stamps. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Depiction of cycle sports ==\n\nCycle sports include:\n\nIndoor\nCycle racing\nVelodromes\nOutdoor\nEvent racing, e.g. cycling to raise money for charities\nTour racing, e.g. the Giro d'Italia\n\n\n== Depiction of non-sport uses ==\n\nSubjects depicted on non-sport bicycle stamps include:\n\nThe history of the bicycle\nBicycle industrial manufacturing\nBicycle mail transportation and postal delivery\nBicycles for commercial delivery\nPeople transportation e.g. by rickshaw\nBicycle military use\nBicycles as toys\nBicycle tourism\nBicycles in street scenes\nBicycles to symbolize alternative, energy-efficient transport\nBicycles depicting or encouraging road traffic safety\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSudbury, Ronald F.

        "content": "\"Ludi letnji ples\" (\"Serbian Cyrillic: Луди летњи плес\"; transl. Crazy Summer Dance) is a song by Flamingosi featuring Louis from the Flamingosi album Gordost i predrasude, which was came second in Serbian: Evropesma 2006, Serbia and Montenegro's national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006.\n\n\n== The Evropesma 2006 controversy ==\n\nThe song of the Montenegrin band No Name Moja ljubavi took second place in the Montenegrin semi-final \"Montevizija 2006,\" qualifying for the national final Evropesma. Flamingosi's song won the Serbian semi-final of Beovizija on February 13, 2006. Therefore, it was one of the twelve songs that qualified for the national final, Evropesma.  In the final, the song finished in second place, behind \"Moja ljubavi\", which has won largely thanks to the support of the jury members from Montenegro. The members of the Montenegrin jury did not award any points to the two best-placed songs from Beovizija, including Ludi letnji ples, which also happened at the 2005 Evropesma. The jury's voting ended with an eight-point lead for the song Moja Ljubavi, exactly as much as they received from the members of the Serbian jury. In the TV voting, the audience gave 12,000 votes to Flamingosi and only 3,500 to No Name. The disgruntled audience in the hall demanded that Flamingosi and Louis sing for them at the end of the program, not the official winners, which is what later happened.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nRadio Television of Serbia did not want to accept victory and planned to organize a new national final whose outcome would be entirely determined by televoting. Radio and Television of Montenegro refused, claiming the result to have been legitimate. Unable to reach an agreement, Serbia and Montenegro withdrew from Eurovision 2006.\nThe State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved following a referendum on May 21, 2006, one day after the Eurovision final. Since the 2007 competition, Serbia and Montenegro have competed individually.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe public reception was positive, it became a hit in the Balkan region, and some even called the song \"the Serbian Macarena\". There are several versions of this song. The first one is the original version for the Evropesma competition, the post-competition version with mention of the defeat and the cities of Serbia and Montenegro, not European capital cities, and the semi-instrumental version with only the female vocals and the chorus.\nIn the 2020s, the song became popular again on TikTok.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLudi letnji ples on AppleMusic\nLudi letnji ples on Spotify\nTik tok hashtag\nReviews of the song",

        "content": "\"Euphoria\" is a diss track written and recorded by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, in response to Canadian-American rapper Drake's single \"Push Ups\" and his independently released song \"Taylor Made Freestyle\". It was unexpectedly released on April 30, 2024, via Interscope Records, initially as a YouTube exclusive before being released to streaming platforms hours later. The song takes its name from the American teen drama series Euphoria, of which Drake serves as an executive producer. \nThe song was produced by Cardo and Kyuro, with additional work from Johnny Juliano, Sounwave, and Yung Exclusive. Its extended introduction contains a sample of Teddy Pendergrass's 1981 song \"You're My Latest, My Greatest Inspiration\". \"Euphoria\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its humorous yet hateful tone, Lamar's versatile performance, and complex entendres. However, criticism was directed at the production and a few punchlines that some considered objectionable. The song broke the single-day streaming record for a hip hop song in 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn March 22, 2024, Kendrick Lamar made a surprise appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's collaborative studio album We Don't Trust You on the single \"Like That\". His featured verse was a diss against Drake and J. Cole in response to their single \"First Person Shooter\". Cole rebutted \"Like That\" first with the polarizing \"7 Minute Drill\", which he later retracted and removed from streaming services.\nDrake offered two responses to \"Like That\". His first, \"Push Ups\", was premiered by media personality DJ Akademiks after a low quality demo version that sampled \"Get Money\" by Junior M.A.F.I.A. was leaked. Throughout the song, Drake mocks Lamar's short stature and musical authenticity, all the while generating rumors of him being extorted by his former label, Top Dawg Entertainment.\nThe second response, \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", was released on Drake's social media accounts immediately after \"Push Ups\" was released to streaming platforms. The song used vocals generated from artificial intelligence of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, two of Lamar's musical idols, to entice him to release his own response. He also questioned his friendship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, whom the freestyle is named after. Shakur's estate sent Drake a cease and desist letter accusing him of violating the rapper's personality rights and abusing his legacy. They further claimed that the AI-generated vocals being used against Lamar, a \"good friend\" of the estate who respected Shakur publicly and privately, compounded the disrespect. Drake was ordered to remove the song from his social media accounts or face litigation; he obliged to the former demand.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe song begins with an audio sample, which was revealed to be a reversed audio clip from The Wiz, a 1978 remake of The Wizard of Oz starring Michael Jackson (who Drake has often compared himself to), in which Richard Pryor, who plays the titular Wiz, states \"Everything they say about me is true. I'm a phony.\" After this, the song starts out \"softly\" with Lamar waiting until the final line of the first verse to directly address Drake. The song's intro builds around a sample of Teddy Pendergrass's song \"You're My Latest, My Greatest Inspiration\". Lamar talks about a \"paranoid\", \"pathetic\", and \"spiraling\" master manipulator \"fabricating stories on the family front\". The beat then picks up as the delivery gets \"sharper\", while the rapper makes references to Drake's name (\"Draco Pistol\"), as well as the previous diss track \"Taylor Made\".\nLamar later mentions Drake and Cole by name and references \"The Story of Adidon\", a 2018 diss track by Pusha T aimed against Drake, in the context of fatherhood. In other instances, he accuses Drake of being a \"scam artist\" and namedrops artists such as YNW Melly, Gunna, Daft Punk, Lil Yachty, and Sexyy Red. Lamar also accuses Drake of sending a cease and desist letter to prevent the release of \"Like That\": \"Try cease and desist on the 'Like That' record / Ho, what? You ain't like that record?\" Further references in the song include Drake's Meek Mill diss track \"Back to Back\".\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n\"Euphoria\" was first released to YouTube on April 30, 2024, with no prior announcement. It was published on the platform at approximately 8:24 a.m. PT, which many alluded was a nod to the basketball player Kobe Bryant; he was a shooting guard for the Los Angeles Lakers under the jersey numbers 8 and 24. Hours after its YouTube launch, \"Euphoria\" was made available on music streaming services through Interscope Records. Brian Zisook, co-founder of Audiomack, noted that the song is Lamar's first release under a new direct licensing agreement with Interscope following his departure from Top Dawg Entertainment (under a joint deal with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope); Lamar's own creative communications company, PGLang, is reportedly not involved in the deal. \nThe song's cover art is a screenshot of Merriam-Webster's definition of the word \"euphoria\", but journalists believe that its title is also a reference to the American television series of the same name. Drake is one of the series' executive producers, which has been a subject of controversy for its use of mature content, including sexual material, amongst its teenage characters.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nPer a Complex assessment, which graded the song's lyrics, presentation, quality and overall effectiveness, \"Euphoria\" received a score of 42 out of 50 (84%). Its examiner, Peter A. Berry, concluded that the song is a \"bit too sprawling\" for its own good, and the production is \"kinda mid,\" but it ultimately offers a \"potent mix of skill, viciousness, and humor that would be hard for anyone to overcome.\"\nVivian Medithi of The Fader described \"Euphoria\" as a standout rap song and a \"dynamic study in hating.\" Rolling Stone's Andre Gee was impressed at how Lamar sounded like a \"seasoned vet\" despite the song being his first official diss record. He noted that, while many of Lamar's criticisms had been expressed before, \"the way he lobs his insults makes it a haymaker\", concluding that the track was an \"eruption of disdain\" for Drake. Angel Diaz, writing for Billboard, called the song \"six minutes and 23 seconds of pure, unadulterated hate\". Diaz felt that Lamar's response was \"well worth the wait\", praising its dense lyricism and opining that Drake's diss tracks up to that point had not \"hit as hard\" as \"Like That\" and \"Euphoria\".\nIn less favorable reviews, Pitchfork's Alphonse Pierre felt that \"Euphoria\" lacked a \"knockout blow\" that could have pushed Lamar's feud with Drake past \"fleeting spectacle\". Pierre felt that the track was substandard to other disses like Nas' \"Ether\", especially on the matter of what Pierre perceived as \"gay jokes\" in \"Euphoria\". Pierre also commented negatively on the song's production, especially believing that the track has \"the worst beat switch-ups you'll hear all year.\" Ben Beaumont-Thomas for The Guardian similarly wrote that for someone whose artistry \"rests on his self-presentation as flawed but enlightened\", Lamar demeaned himself with the usage of \"outright\" misogynistic and homophobic lyrics; particularly the usage of the term dickrider to describe Drake's OVO labelmates. Beaumont-Thomas also criticized the production, describing the beat as \"blah even if Lamar does ride it with skill and animation\".\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\"Euphoria\" was the subject of extensive press attention following its release. New Ho King, a Chinese restaurant located in Toronto's Chinatown neighborhood, was flooded with five-star reviews on Google Maps after it was mentioned in the track.\nU.S. President Joe Biden's 2024 presidential campaign team used the song in a video against his opponent Donald Trump, overlaying edited lyrics criticizing Trump's behavior: “I hate the way that you walk over women’s rights, the way that you talk about immigrants. I hate the way that you dress, I hate the way that you sneak diss on Truth Social.”\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Euphoria\" reached number one on the US Spotify charts, as well as number one on the US Apple Music and global music charts. It debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, before reaching a new peak at number 3 the following week on the chart.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKendrick Lamar – vocals, songwriter\nCardo – producer\nKyuro – producer\nJohnny Juliano – producer\nSounwave – producer\nYung Exclusive – producer\nMatthew Bernard – additional keyboards, associated performer\nJonathan Turner – mixing\nRay Charles Brown Jr. – recording engineer\nNicolas De Porcel – mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Maestro\" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band Seventeen. It was released on April 29, 2024, as the lead single from the compilation album 17 Is Right Here. It debuted at number one on the Circle Digital Chart.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter having initially teased new content on their Follow tour encore concerts in Incheon, Seventeen officially announced the release of 17 is Right Here, a compilation album that would encompass their nine-year career, on April 2, 2024. On April 18, the album revealed a 33-song tracklist, which included the band's greatest hits, as well as four new songs: \"Spell\", \"Cheers to Youth\", \"Lalali\", and the lead single \"Maestro\".\n\"Maestro\" premiered at Seventeen's encore Follow Again to Seoul concerts at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on April 27 and 28. The song and its accompanying music video were officially released on April 29, 2024.\nOn May 2, Seventeen announced an orchestral remix of the song, to be released the following day. It was released on May 3, alongside a previously unreleased instrumental version of the original track.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Maestro\" was described as a dance R&B track that pulls various elements from Seventeen's previous hits, such as \"Very Nice\", \"Oh My!\", \"Fear\", \"Rock with You\", \"Cheers\", and \"Super\". By incorporating these elements, the song aimed to convey the message of the past continuing to be a source of inspiration for the group as they evolve.\nThe song was composed by Woozi, Bumzu, Ninos Hanna, Andreas Öberg, Gabriel Brandes, Justin Starling, Maya Rose, Niklas Jarelius Persson, William Segerdahl, and Yeom Dong-gun; its lyrics were written by Woozi and Bumzu.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was released on April 29, 2024. In an effort to question the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in music and art, the cyberpunk-themed music video, which features Seventeen performing in technology-heavy sets and fighting against robots, was intentionally partially created using AI, showcasing the band's thoughts and fears of a modern world where \"everything is created through AI and new technologies\". \nThe music video was partly filmed at Kwangwoon University's Cultural Centre, the hall Seventeen hosted their first fan meeting at in 2015, and a showcase for the 17 Is Right Here album in May 2024.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Maestro\" debuted at number one on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart and component Download Chart, as recorded on the charts dated April 28 – May 5, 2024. The song also entered the World Digital Song Sales weekly chart at number five on the chart dated May 11.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nCristina Jaleru of the Associated Press lauded \"Maestro\" as \"a playful R&B tune intertwined with an engaging EDM hook\", further calling it a \"perfect encapsulation of the band's past sound with present inclinations\". In a four-star review for Rolling Stone India, Debashree Dutta praised Seventeen for their \"seamless harmony [which] creates a luminous soundscape in conjunction that showcases their musical expertise and virtuosity\", noting that the song \"builds in passion and profundity as solid rap, vocals, and performance take center stage\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nOn South Korean music programs, \"Maestro\" achieved first place wins on the May 8 episode of Show Champion, May 9 episode of M Countdown, May 10 episode of Music Bank, and May 11 episode of Show! Music Core.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mark Murphy Sings Nat's Choice The Complete Nat \"King\" Cole Songbook Volumes 1 and 2 is a 1986 studio compilation album by Mark Murphy.\nMark Murphy Sings Nat's Choice The Complete Nat \"King\" Cole Songbook Volumes 1 and 2  is a compilation of two Muse Records studio albums by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy; namely, Mark Murphy Sings the Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume One and Mark Murphy Sings Nat's Choice: The Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume Two. It was released by the Muse label in the United States in 1986, the year following the releases of the separate volumes. This album is a collection of songs associated with Nat King Cole. Murphy received his third Grammy Award nomination for his performance. Mark Murphy released several tribute albums during his career including Memories of You for Joe Williams, Bop for Miles for Miles Davis, Bop for Kerouac and Kerouac, Then and Now for Jack Kerouac, Night Moods for Ivan Lins, The Latin Porter for Cole Porter, and What a Way to Go dedicated to Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1983 Murphy decided to record a tribute album to his teenage idol Nat King Cole. Murphy said, \"Everybody else was a Sinatra freak, but I was a Nat King Cole freak...He was like rhythmic honey\". Murphy said that Cole delivered, \"the loosest, slipperiest vocals in the world\". Murphy wrote in the liner notes to Vol.1, \"This Nat King Cole Songbook is dedicated to his daughter Natalie and brother Freddie - two fabulous singers - but mostly to the memory of Nat's A&R man at Capitol Records, Lee Gillette. Lee was also a founding member of NARAS\".\nIn an interview with John Watson for the BBC Murphy said, “My uncle - my mother's brother - introduced me to the music of Art Tatum in around 1937 or 38, and so I started riding down across the park to listen to the rest of his jazz records. He had a lot of Benny Goodman, and I had very early introductions to Peggy Lee, Stan Kenton, June Christy . . . and Nat \"King\" Cole was truly my king in those days, you know.”\n\n\n== Recording ==\nThe tracks were recorded in two sessions in October and November of 1983 with Murphy and Steve Zegree producing. Each tune is recorded as a duet with a single instrument, either bass, piano or guitar. Murphy was attracted to the challenge of having his voice so very exposed in this rather stark approach to the songs. Michael Bourne wrote in the liner notes, \"Murphy's voice, always a spectacular instrument in itself, is called upon to be even more virtuosic than ever\". Murphy said the recording was a tribute, not a copy, \"to my first influence, and to Nat's taste. Of course he could make everything sound good, but he also picked such wonderful songs\". Murphy decided to include many lesser known songs associated with Cole, and avoided many of his bigger hits.\nBob Magnusson, who appeared with Murphy on Bop for Kerouac, accompanies on bass on three tracks (1,6,16). The pianist and guitarist had not previously recorded with Murphy. Gary Schunk accompanies on piano on seven tracks (3, 5, 8–11, 15).  And Murphy is accompanied by guitarist Joseph LoDuca on seven tracks (2, 4, 7, 12–14, 17).\nTwo tracks, one from each original volume, did not make it on this compilation: \"Until the Real Thing Comes Along / Baby, Baby All the Time\" (Sammy Cahn, Saul Chaplin, L.E. Freeman, Mann Holiner, Alberta Nichols / Bobby Troup) which is track 8 on volume 1 and \"Walkin' My Baby Back Home / Breezin' Along With the Breeze\" (Fred Ahlert, Roy Turk / Haven Gillespie, Seymour Simons, Richard A. Whiting) which is track 3 on volume 2.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nScott Yanow assigns 4 stars to Vol. 1 and 3 stars to Vol. 2 in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz. He said, \"It would have been nice if all of the musicians could have played together a bit, but the strong material and Murphy's interpretive skills hold one's interest throughout...Murphy mostly avoided the obvious hits, opting for particularly strong material that fits his chance-taking style\". Yanow calls the combined release of Vol.1 and Vol 2. \"excellent\" in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones singles out \"These Foolish Things\" as \"one of the most affecting songs on the album\", and said the recordings for Vol 2. were \"more accessible\" than Vol 1.\nMurphy was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards for his performance on Mark Murphy Sings Nat's Choice - The Nat \"King\" Cole Songbook Volume I. He lost to Bobby McFerrin and Jon Hendricks for Another Night in Tunisia.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Nature Boy / Calypso Blues\" (Eden Ahbez / Nat King Cole, Don George) – 5:56\n\"Love Letters / Serenata\" (Victor Young, Edward Heyman / Leroy Anderson, Mitchell Parish) – 3:39\n\"Oh You Crazy Moon\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) – 3:38\n\"’Tis Autumn\" (Henry Nemo) – 4:13\n\"I Keep Goin’ Back To Joe's\" (Marvin Fisher, Jack Segal) – 4:18\n\"Tangerine\" (Victor Schertzinger, Johnny Mercer) – 3:50\n\"Lush Life\" (Billy Strayhorn) – 4:22\n\"Never Let Me Go\" (Jay Livingston, Ray Evans) – 3:32\n\"These Foolish Things\" (Jack Strachey, Harry Link, Holt Marvell) – 4:17\n\"Portrait of Jennie / Ruby\" (J.

        "content": "Aaron Clement Waters  (1905–1991) was an American geologist, petrologist, and volcanologist, known for his pioneering work on the Columbia River Basalt.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAaron C. Waters was born as the youngest of seven children of parents who were pioneers in Washington state and grew wheat at their homestead. He graduated in geology from the University of Washington with a B.Sc. in 1927 and an M.Sc. in 1928. He graduated with a Ph.D. in geology in 1930 from Yale University. His doctoral dissertation Geology of the Southern Half of the Chelan [30′] Quadrangle, Washington was supervised by Adolph Knopf. From 1930 to 1951 Waters held an appointment as a faculty member at Stanford University. He was leave of absence for the arcademic year 1937–1938 and during WW II from 1942 to 1945. For the academic year 1937–1938 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and did research in Scotland and Scandinavia. In 1940 he married Elizabeth von Hoene, who was then a student at Mills College. During their marriage, she often accompanied him in his fieldwork and served as camp cook. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) expanded its search for strategic minerals. Waters went on an extended leave of absence to serve in the USGS — the main focus of his work was on mercury deposits. He first worked in Arkansas and then in several western states. Before the end of WW II he was sent to search for other metal ores in different parts of the USA. In 1945 he returned to his professorial duties at Stanford and began to focus on basalts and other volcanic rocks of the Pacific Northwest. Waters, in collaboration with James Gilluly and Alfred Woodford, wrote a textbook Principles of Geology, which was published by W. H. Freeman and Company in 1951. The Principles of Geology went through 4 editions and for more than two decades remained the leading introductory textbook for geology. Waters acquired expertise concerning uranium ores and from 1951 to 1952 participated in the USGS's exploration for uranium ores on the Colorado Plateau.\nIn 1952 Waters resigned from Stanford University to accept an appointment at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a professor from 1952 to 1963. From 1963 to 1967 he was a professor and chair of the geology department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. From 1967 to 1972 he was a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There he established a Ph.D. program in earth sciences and retired as professor emeritus in 1972. During his years as a professor at U.C. Santa Cruz, he worked with Richard Virgil Fisher on maar volcanism.\nIn retirement as professor emeritus, Waters occasionally taught part-time at the University of Satan Cruz and  held visiting professorships at Oregon State University, the University of Texas at El Paso, and California State University, Los Angeles. As professor emeritus, he also worked as a research consultant for the USGS and Los Alamos National Laboratory.\nWaters was elected in 1964 a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and in 1966 a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1982 he was awarded the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America.\nIn 1983 Aaron and Elizabeth Waters settled in Tacoma, where he continued to write about geology and pursue his hobby of gardening. Upon his death in 1991, he was survived by his widow, their two daughters, and three grandchildren.\n\n\n== Research ==\nWaters was a leading expert on the geology of the Pacific Northwest. He did research on volcanology, igneous and metamorphic petrology, geomorphology, and tectonics. With Konrad B. Krauskopf, he did important fieldwork on protoplastic deformation found in the Colville batholith. Waters was the author or co-author of classic articles on determining the directions of flow in volcanic rocks and on documenting the characteristics of volcanic base surge deposits.\nAs a participant in the Apollo program, he contributed to research on lunar geology, including composition and origin of the lunar surface and assessment of Apollo landing sites. He was involved in the geological training of the astronauts, including those astronauts who later made lunar landings.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nFuller, Richard E.; Waters, Aaron Clement (1929). \"The Nature and Origin of the Horst and Graben Structure of Southern Oregon\".

        "content": "Victor Richard Ratten (12 December 1878 – 30 December 1962) was an Australian surgeon and hospital administrator. He was known for his long involvement with Royal Hobart Hospital, serving as superintendent from 1917 to 1936 and as a surgeon until his death in 1962. He came into conflict with the medical establishment in Tasmania on a number of occasions and was the subject of a royal commission into his qualifications in 1918.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRatten was born on 12 December 1878 in Kew, Victoria. He was the son of Eliza Ann (née Gordon) and George William Ratten. His father was a schoolteacher and was later ordained as an Anglican minister.\nRatten spent part of his childhood in Port Fairy, Victoria. He and his family later moved to Forbes, New South Wales, where his father established a private school, the Lachlan College. He was a talented sportsman as a youth, winning several cycling championships. After leaving school, Ratten worked for the Union Bank of Australia in Forbes until 1898, when he and a friend announced their intention to travel the world by bicycle. Their progress to Sydney was reported in local newspapers but they did not proceed further.\nAfter serving an apprenticeship with a dentist in Sydney, Ratten returned to country New South Wales in 1899 and began practising as a dentist in West Wyalong. By 1903 he had moved to Brisbane. He later spent time in the United States and in March 1907 acquired a diploma of medicine at Harvey Medical College in Chicago. The college was short-lived and the validity of Ratten's qualification was later the subject of debate.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nIn May 1907, Ratten established a medical practice in Sheffield, Tasmania, joining his father in the state. He practised in Sheffield for seven years and was a health officer for the Kentish Municipal Council, also serving as a justice of the peace. In August 1914, Ratten enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps and was attached to the 12th Battalion as a regimental medical officer. He departed for Egypt aboard HMAT Geelong in October 1914. He returned to Australia in 1915 after being unfit for military service, although he was not discharged from service until March 1918.\nRatten was refused admission to the Tasmanian branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) after its formation in 1911, as it did not recognise his American qualification. He moved to Hobart in 1916 after purchasing an existing medical practice.\n\n\n=== Royal Hobart Hospital ===\nRatten was appointed surgeon-superintendent of Hobart General Hospital (later Royal Hobart Hospital) in 1917. He had a reputation as a skilled surgeon, \"insisting on extremely high standards of hygiene, theatre teamwork and modern equipment\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1907, Ratten married Blanche Greaves, with whom he had two sons. His oldest son John Richard Ratten was an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and died in 1945 while on active service.\nOutside of medicine, Ratten was an antique collector and owned racehorses. His horse The Artist won the Hobart Cup and Launceston Cup in 1949, and he also won the Hobart Cup with Wingfire in 1947.\nRatten died in Hobart on 30 December 1962, aged 84.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Klára Dostálová (born 13 March 1971) is a Czech politician and economist who has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic since 2017. She served as Deputy Minister of Local Development in the Second Cabinet of Andrej Babiš from 2014 to 2017 before being appointed permanently from December 2017 until 2021. In 2020, Dostálová returned to the council of the Hradec Králové region, of which she has been a member from 2016 until 2017. Dostálová is active in politics as a non-party member of the ANO movement.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDostálová served as chairwoman of the Center for European Design between 2009 and 2014. She faced suspicions of manipulating the repair of Hořice Square, in which CEP prepared an application for a subsidiary, where her father Vilém Tvrdík subsequently won the tender.\nDostálová was also involved in the non-profit company Revitalizace KUKS ops, which has been in liquidation since 6 January 2023, where she served as chairwoman of directors board. Since 2014, Dostálová has been a member of the board of directors of the Mountain Service of the Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Deputy Minister for Local Development ===\nIn February 2014, Dostálová replaced Věra Jourová as Deputy Minister for Local Development of the Czech Republic. Dostálová remained at the ministry even after the arrival of new minister Karla Šlechtová. The same year on 10 November, Dostálová also became first deputy minister of regional development.\nIn the 2016 Czech regional elections, Dostálová was the leading candidate of the ANO movement in the Hradec Králové Region from the position of a non-party member and was elected as a representative. However, she resigned from the representative mandate in April 2017 due to the incompatibility of the functions of regional representative and deputy minister for regional development. The opinion on the incompatibility of the functions was promoted by the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic.

        "content": "Natsumi Sakai (酒井 菜摘, Sakai Natsumi, born 24 July 1986) is a Japanese politician who currently serves as a member of the House of Representatives for Tokyo-15. She previously served in the Kōtō Ward Assembly, and ran for mayor of Kōtō in 2023 with backing from a majority of the opposition.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSakai was born in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture on July 24, 1986. After graduating from Jiyugaoka High School Nursing Department, she moved to Tokyo and worked as a nurse in the obstetrics and gynecology department at Sasa General Hospital in Nishitokyo, Tokyo. She obtained her midwifery license in 2011. Since 2013, she has worked as a staff member at the opening of the perinatal center at Showa University Koto Toyosu Hospital.\nIn 2014, at the age of 28, Sakai was diagnosed with cervical cancer. While on leave, she underwent uterine-conserving surgery and chemotherapy, but continued to work. During the 2015 unified local elections, she decided to become a politician after seeing a poster on an election bulletin board that featured a single mother and a female nursery school teacher as candidates. She underwent infertility treatment using in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and after a threatened miscarriage and premature birth, gave birth to her first daughter in 2017. She returned to work in 2018.\nShe ran as a candidate for the Kōtō Ward Assembly as an endorsed member of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan in 2017, and was elected for the first time. She then participated in the formation of the new CDP, before being re-elected in 2023 as the third highest vote getting candidate out of 59.\nOn 14 November, she left the CDP, and two days later, announced her candidacy for mayor of Kōtō following the resignation of Mayor Yayoi Kimura. She ran as an independent with the backing of the CDP, Japanese Communist Party, Reiwa Shinsengumi, Social Democratic Party, Tokyo Seikatsusha Network, and Greens Japan. She filed her candidacy on 3 December, the public notice date, and resigned from the Assembly as a result. She  ended up losing to Tomoka Okubo, who was backed by a unified group of the LDP, Tomin First no Kai, Komeito, and the Democratic Party for the People. In an interview after her loss, she stated she was \"disappointed she couldn't break away from old politics.\"\nOn 1 February, 2024, Mito Kakizawa resigned from the House of Representatives due to his arrest, leaving the 15th district in Tokyo up for a by-election. On 4 April, the CDP announced it would back Sakai for the by-election following his resignation. In response to this, four days later, the Communist Party candidate announced they would withdraw and back Sakai. Votes were counted on 28 April, and she was elected with a clear plurality, being sworn in two days later.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lilika Nakos (Greek: Λιλίκα Νάκου; February 24, 1904 – May 25, 1989), sometimes written Lilika Nakou, was a pioneering Greek journalist and writer. \nShe has been described as one of the \"grandes dames of modern Greek literature.\" According to scholar Deborah Tannen, she was \"one of the first women writers of modern Greek prose and for many years the only woman in Greek journalism.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIoulia Nakos, known by the nickname Lilika, was born in Athens in 1904, although her date of birth is somewhat disputed. Her father was Loukas Nakos, a member of parliament. Both her father and her mother, Eleni Papadopoulos, were from upper-class families, and she spent much of her childhood traveling around Europe.\nIn 1911, Nakos moved to Geneva, Switzerland, with her mother. She studied at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève and then the University of Geneva. Her youth in Geneva brought her into contact with the international pacifist left, which had a significant impact on her perspective throughout her life.\n\n\n== Writing career and war years ==\nFrom 1924 to 1929, Nakos lived in Davos, where she was helping her only great love, George Ventiris, recover from tuberculosis. While there, she began writing, and her stories were published in Paris magazines. Then, in 1928, her first book, Photini, was published in Paris, and subsequently in Greek translation in Athens.\nAfter living with Ventiris in Paris in 1929, the following year she returned to Greece, where she became a member of the Generation of the '30s literary movement. Alongside such writers as Elli Alexiou, Galateia Kazantzakis, Zoe Karelli, and Maria Polydouri, she is considered one of the first women to contribute significantly to Greek literature. \nIn 1932, she published her first Greek-language fiction collection, I Xepartheni. She also began collaborating internationally with other anti-fascist writers. In this decade, she worked as a high school in Crete and Athens, and established a puppet theater in the capital. Nakos became known as one of the first women to write prose in Greek, and to frankly depict women's coming-of-age stories. \nShe also began working as a journalist, writing from 1934 to 1941 for the newspaper Akropolis. Then, in the mid-'40s, she wrote for the papers Ethnos and Embros. She was politically active, both in her writing and as a member of such organizations as the Greek League for Women's Rights. During the Metaxas dictatorship, she helped sequester communists in her family's home in the Athens suburbs.\nFrom 1937 to 1939, she was married to Constantine Foskolos. Their relationship ended in divorce.\nIn 1941, during the Axis occupation of Greece, Nakos worked as a volunteer nurse. She suffered significant physical and emotional trauma in this period. Her 1944 book I Kolasi Ton Paidion collected stories she wrote based on her experiences treating children during the ensuing famine. It was published in English translation as The Children's Inferno: Stories of the Great Famine in Greece in 1946.\nWith the death of her mother in 1947, due to the long-term effects of starvation during the war, Nakos returned to Switzerland, where she settled in Lausanne. She wrote for French-language newspapers in Switzerland and Paris from 1947 to 1955, and then for the Greek publication Ora, before retiring with a pension from the Journalists' Union in 1958. She also wrote several more books throughout the 1950s and '60s, and became particularly known for her 1955 work I Kyria Ntoremi (\"Mrs. Doremi\"), which is considered her only comic novel.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nAfter suffering paralyzing back pain, Nakos began spending time recovering in Icaria on a doctor's advice. In 1967, while on the island, she was severely paralyzed due to sciatica and returned permanently to Athens.\nIn 1979, her book Oi Parastratimenoi (\"The Lost\") was made into a television series, followed by a serial based on I Kyria Ntoremi in the 1980s, drawing renewed attention to her work. She died in 1989 at age 81.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nPhotini (1928)\nI Xepartheni (1932)\nOi Parastratimenoi (1935)\nI Zoi tou Edgar Poe (1936)\nI Kolasi Ton Paidion (1944)\nNafsika (1953)\nI Kyria Ntoremi (1955)\nAnthropina Pepromena (1955)\nYia Mia Kainouryia Zoi (1960)\nOi Oramatistes Tis Ikarias (1963)\nProsopikotites pou Gnorisa (1965)\nTo Chroniko Mias Dimosiografou (1980)\nI Istoria tis Parthenias tis Despoinidas Tade (1981)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Memória do Bixiga Museum is located in São Paulo, Brazil, and tells the story of the region's Italian immigrants. Founded in 1981, it is one of the city's oldest museums and is located in a typical 20th century building at 118 Rua dos Ingleses. It was closed from 2005 to 2010, but later reopened to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\nOpened in 1981, the Memória do Bixiga Museum was designed by the neighborhood's cultural agitator, Armando Puglisi, commonly known as Armandinho do Bixiga, and features objects related to Italian immigrants in the region. Most of the items on display were donated by Puglisi or by residents of the neighborhood.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe museum's collection includes 1,500 different items, as well as 8,000 photographs including objects by Adoniran Barbosa. Among the items on display, many of them donated by the creator of the place himself, there are pasta machines and bottles in which milk was delivered door-to-door at the time. The collection also includes classic uniforms from the Vai-Vai samba school, Carmen Miranda's shoes, weapons from the 1932 Revolution, a dentist's chair from the 1920s and photos of Bixiga.\nThe building is larger than its first location. On the first floor, visitors can see a refrigerator that is over 100 years old, a pair of gloves belonging to \"Piranha\" (Pedro Galasso), a veteran boxer who also lived in the neighborhood, and letters from the Second World War.\nAlthough little is known about the building that houses the Memória do Bixiga Museum, it was built at the beginning of the 20th century and is listed by Conpresp. Due to administrative problems, it was closed from 2005 to 2010, but reopened on 18 March 2010.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Venom of the Red Lotus\" is the thirteenth and final episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Legend of Korra, which is a spin-off to Avatar: The Last Airbender, and the 39th episode overall. The show follows Avatar Korra (Janet Varney), the only person capable of bending all four elements (water, earth, fire, and air), as she tries to maintain balance in the world, with this season focusing on her battle with The Red Lotus, led by Zaheer (Henry Rollins), as they intend to create an anarchist world free from government and the Avatar.\nThe episode was directed by Melchior Zwyer and written by Joshua Hamilton and Tim Hedrick, and follows the Red Lotus aiming to kill Korra while she is in the Avatar State so they can end the Avatar cycle. The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon's website on August 22, 2014, and received critical acclaim for its action sequences, animation and ending.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn caves near the Northern Air Temple, Zaheer and the Red Lotus administer mercury poison to Korra seeking to let her enter the Avatar State before killing her so that the Avatar reincarnation cycle will be broken. Jinora, using her spiritual projection abilities, overhears the plan and tells the rest of the airbenders who have been captured. The rest of Team Avatar follows Kai to a cave system where they find and rescue the airbenders. Korra's father Tonraq, Bolin and Mako go to search for Korra, who is resisting entering the Avatar State. As she resists, she sees her past enemies: Amon, Unalaq and Vaatu.\nEventually, Korra stops resisting and enters the Avatar State, however the Red Lotus find they have underrated Korra's power as she quickly escapes her chains. Zaheer flies from the caves and Korra chases after him, while Bolin fights Ghazan and Mako fights Ming-Hua. Korra uses her fire and earthbending to propel herself into a fight with Zaheer, while Tenzin reunites with his children and Tonraq begs the airbenders to help Korra. Inside the caves, Mako electrocutes Ming-Hua to death while Ghazan, refusing to go back to prison, uses lavabending to collapse the caves, killing himself. Bolin and Mako manage to escape the caves before they collapse.\nAs Korra's body becomes weak due to the poison, Zaheer gains the upper hand in the fight. As he is about to asphyxiate Korra, the airbenders create a giant tornado that pulls him the ground. Zaheer is arrested and Suyin Beifong metalbends the poision out of Korra. Two weeks later, Korra is in a wheelchair and is being helped around by Asami Sato. She attends a ceremony where Tenzin makes Jinora an airbending master and he tasks the new Air Nation with continuing Korra's legacy in helping keep balance to the world. Korra watches this and lets out a single tear.\n\n\n== Credits and production ==\nThe episode was directed by Melchior Zwyer and written by Joshua Hamilton and Tim Hedrick.\n\nThe idea of restraining the Avatar in X-shaped chains, as seen in this episode, was originally conceived for the scene of Aang being captured by the Fire Nation in the first season of Avatar, but was then vetoed by the network. It was allowed this time, according to Bryan Konietzko, after he complained about seeing a shot of SpongeBob SquarePants, another Nickelodeon character, similarly restrained.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode received critical acclaim from critics and fans and is considered one of the best episodes of the series.\nOliver Sava of The A.V. Club stated that \"The power on display in the final Korra/Zaheer fight is breathtaking, and director Mel Zwyer does phenomenal work capturing the full impact of the fight. The standout moment is an extended single shot following the two fighters as they exchange blows while navigating through the air, creating a disorienting sense of weightlessness as the camera gets swept up in their gravity-defying movement.\" Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, writing that \"The Legend of Korra's Book Three finale ended on a solemn note, following an action-packed and climactic showdown\" and \"The final confrontation between Korra and Zaheer, for example, was gorgeously animated and scored but also very raw and personal. Meanwhile, the Bending Brothers' fight against Ming-Hua and Ghazan brought its own thrills.\"\nLeo Noboru Lima of Slash Film wrote that \"No other half-hour in the show's history packs so much gripping action, grand drama, character progression, visual splendor, and seismic narrative development into its running time; it's the kind of dizzying, mind-blowing, expletive-inspiring Great TV that shows like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Lost\" offered at their best.\" Michael Mammano of Den of Geek gave the episode a score of 5 stars out of 5, stating that \"This finale succeeded in so many ways...\" and praised the character arcs of the season that were further developed or concluded in the episode saying \"Korra and Asami’s friendship, Lin and Su’s family history, the return of the Air Nation and Tenzin’s coping with how his culture will inevitably change, Jinora’s coming of age, Kai gaining a sense of community and responsibility, Bolin learning to be himself both in regards to how he approaches girls and how his bending will evolve… there was so much going on, and it was great!\"\n\n\n== Notelist ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Funeral for Justice is a 2024 studio album by Nigerien desert blues band Mdou Moctar, released on Matador Records. It has received positive reviews from critics and was supported by a concert tour. The album explores cultural and political themes, including the impact of foreign interference in Nigerien affairs and the replacement of indigenous languages with colonial ones.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nEditors at AnyDecentMusic? scored this release 8.1 out of 10, aggregating 14 reviews. According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Funeral for Justice received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 from 12 critic scores. It is the second highest rated album of 2024 on Metacritic, behind Cowboy Carter.\nWriting at The Arts Desk, Guy Oddy scored this release 4 out of 5 stars, calling it \"the real deal and, at a time when most Western musicians seem to be afraid or uninterested in calling out those who are driving us all to disaster\" and \"louder, faster and more overtly political than any of his band’s previous discs\". Bill Pearis of BrooklynVegan included this among the best releases of the week, calling this the band's \"most overtly political album yet... with music that is invigorating, stirring and has revolution on its mind\". In Exclaim!, Matthew Teklemariam rated Funeral for Justice an 8 out of 10, writing that \"the music here is so energetic that it's invigorating\" and \"the production is a tight fit\" that results in \"a minor epic built from a surfeit of dissident spirit and Van Halen fanaticism\". Shawn Donohue of Glide Magazine praised the musicianship on display: \"while Moctar’s fire-breathing guitar playing will grab the headlines, it is the drumming that truly adds an extra punch throughout the album\" and \"Funeral for Justice finds the band flying high while creating songs they believe passionately in, resulting in the strongest album of Mdou Moctar’s career\". A profile of the band at Guitar.com by Huw Baines called this their \"most free and experimental album yet\" and praised the guitar-playing by band leader Moctar as well as bassist Mikey Coltun's \"meticulous production\". Janelle Borg of Guitar World stated that this music shows a progression in Moctar's songwriting and likened the playing style to Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.\nNoah Barker of The Line of Best Fit rated Funeral for Justice a 9 out of 10, telling readers \"if you’ve heard a previous Moctar record and pieced together the best bits, you’ll have an imitation of Funeral for Justice’s righteous glory, but if you haven’t, use this record as a roadmap in discovering the previous odd-decade of Moctar’s talent\". Writing for musicOMH, Ross Horton scored this work a 5 out of 5, declaring it \"a fantastic album [which] may be the best of an already-excellent run of albums produced by... the greatest rock band in the world\". A profile of the band in NME by Oumar Selah stated that this release shows that the band \"remain musically inventive and passionate for change in their home nation and beyond\". That magazine also published a review by Max Pilley who scored it 4 out of 5 stars, stating that listeners to this \"wildly exciting\" music \"will not just hear the glorious music of the Tuareg people, but they will understand their struggles, too\". In The New York Times, Ben Sisario called this release \"a cri de coeur of screaming guitars and lyrics decrying the legacy of colonialism in Niger and throughout Africa\" that \"amps up the urgency\" of 2021's Afrique Victime. In The Observer, Phil Mongredien rated Funeral for Justice 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it \"doesn’t pull any punches, whether tackling the disastrous legacy of French colonialism... and the failures of African leaders to build up their countries..., or the way that Moctar’s native Tamasheq language is at risk of dying out as it loses out to French among younger people...\".\nEditors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.4 out of 10, declaring it among the Best New Music and critic Arielle Gordon praised the incendiary political lyrics: \"it’s impossible to miss—from the blood dripping off of the crows on its album cover to the screeching guitars that open its first song, it’s the proud sound of rebellion, transposed from Tamasheq into a language that refuses to be misinterpreted\". At PopMatters, Adriane Pontecorvo rated this album a 10 out of 10, writing that \"Even by Mdou Moctar’s high standards, Funeral for Justice is extraordinary. It is searing in music and lyrics, with messages that are essential in a world on fire and whose sounds can carry those messages far and wide. More than any previous Mdou Moctar album, it feels alive: Moctar and his whole band are in the room with their listeners, fanning the flames of righteous resolve and reminding us that if justice is dead, there’s no more fitting tribute to it than raising our voices on its behalf\". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone called this \"the band’s most forceful album yet, tailor-made to melt minds at massive festivals\" with \"anti-colonial and anti-corruption declarations\" accompanied by Moctar's guitar work. Spin's Ana Leorne gave this album an A, stating that it \"represents another step in decentralizing the public discourse from Western normative standards, hopefully allowing for a better understanding of others and ourselves\". Editors at Stereogum chose this for Album of the Week, with critic Chris DeVille calling it \"a fantastic record that should not have to exist\", due to its response to the 2023 Nigerien coup, but continues that it is \"too energized to be depressing\", with \"with shout-along slogans to go along with the rumbling rhythms and guitar heroism\". In Uncut, Daniel Dylan Wray rated Funeral for Justice 4 out of 5 stars, calling the music \"emphatic psych-rock\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll lyrics are written by Mahamadou Souleymane; all music is composed by Souleymane, Michael Coltun, and Ahmoudou Madassane.\n\n\"Funeral for Justice\" – 3:09\n\"Imouhar\" – 5:07\n\"Takoba\" – 3:54\n\"Sousoume Tamacheq\" – 5:41\n\"Imajighen\" – 4:11\n\"Tchinta\" – 5:13\n\"Djallo #1\" – 0:24\n\"Oh France\" – 5:40\n\"Modern Slaves\" – 5:45\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMdou Moctar\n\nMikey Coltun – bass guitar, guitar, percussion, backing vocals, production, engineering\nSouleymane Ibrahim – drums, djembe, backing vocals\nAhmoudou Madassane – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMdou Moctar – lead guitar, vocals\nTechnical\n\nRobert Beatty – artwork\nHeba Kadry – mastering\nSeth Manchester – mixing\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 in rock music\nList of 2024 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFuneral for Justice at Discogs (list of releases) \nFuneral for Justice at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

He assembled local works, many from suppressed churches and monasteries, for public display. Initially the collection was displayed in the Palazzo dei Priori, with an inauguration of the displays in 1905. The Gallery was closed during the second world war until 1948.\nIn 1981, a display of works at the Palazzo Minucci-Solaini, induced the authorities to create a new museum at this site, inaugurated in 1982. This palazzo was built in late-1400s, with the design traditionally attributed to Antonio da San Gallo il Vecchio.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAmong the works in the museum\n\nVolterra Deposition by Rosso Fiorentino, is considered the mannerist painter's masterpiece\nAnnunciation (1491) and Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saints (1491) by Luca Signorelli\nMadonna of the Rose, Enthroned Madonna and Child and Saints and Saint Nicola da Tolentino and Peter by Taddeo di Bartolo\nCristo in Pietà by Francesco di Neri da Volterra\nMadonna and Child by Jacopo di Michele\nMadonna (called of the long neck) by Stefano di Antonio di Vanni\nSt Sebastian between saints Bartholomew and Nicola by Neri di Bicci\nBirth in the Manger and Scenes from the Life of the Virgin by Benvenuto di Giovanni\nChrist in Glory with Four Saints and a Donor by  Domenico Ghirlandaio\nAdoration of the Shepherds e Mourning over dead Christ by Pieter de Witte\nBirth of the Virgin by Donato Mascagni\nAnnunciation, Immaculate Conception and Mourning over dead Christ del Pomarancio\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Bibliograpy ==\nDerived from Italian wikipedia entry\nRenato Bacci,  La Pinacoteca e il Museo di Arte Sacra  Arti Grafiche C.G., Milano 1997\nAntonio Paolucci, La pinacoteca di Volterra, 1989",

        "content": "Jean Pettrequin (c. 1724-1764) was a carpenter who immigrated to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. He claimed to receive a letter that promised additional supplies to the town; this letter subsequently instigated an uprising in the town. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nPettrequin immigrated to Lunenberg, Nova Scotia, with German and Swiss Protestant settlers in 1752, after overcrowding in Halifax necessitated the migration of these immigrants to other parts of the colony. Each settler was given 50 acres of land in which they did not have to pay taxes on them for 10 years. \nIn his first winter in the town, Pettrequin claimed to receive a letter from a cousin in England. This letter stated that the cousin procured supplies for the town, and asked Pettrequin if the supplies had arrived. A group of townsfolk, disenchanted with their living conditions, demanded to see the letter, which Pettrequin refused to do. Pettrequin was detained in a blockhouse; although he was rescued by Patrick Sutherland, he was subsequently recaptured and returned to the blockhouse. Under torture, Pettrequin claimed that he sold the letter to the town's magistrate Sebastian Zouberbuhler.\nAt a subsequent hearing, Pettrequin claimed that another settler, John William Hoffman, told him that a letter was sent from a sailer in Halifax. Hoffman encouraged Pettrequin to respond to the letter and tell the town of its contents. Hoffman was subsequently convicted of false libel and inciting a riot; Pettrequin's testimony was used to obtain this verdict. \nResearchers do not have details of Pettrequin's life after 1754.\n\n\n== References ==",

The company is known for its efforts in advancing computing technology through the creation of an imperceptible and lightweight smart contact lens. XPANCEO secured a $40 million investment from Hong Kong's Opportunity Ventures to pursue the development of computing devices in the form of smart contact lenses.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded by Valentyn S. Volkov, Ukrainian material scientist and physicist and Roman Axelrod in 2021.\n\n\n== Smart Contact lenses ==\nIn the beginning of 2024, XPANCEO revealed successfully demonstrating the proof of concept for the world's first augmented reality holographic lens testing system. The company's prototypes cover of three categories. These are a lens that allows for night vision and 3D, a lens that offers measurement and precision vision (for example for clinical use), and a holographic lens for augmented reality experiences. The new device, which is the world's first ultra-thin lens, is made of advanced optical materials (including low-dimensional and van der Waals materials), which exhibit record-breaking refractive indices and anisotropy and maintain excellent optical properties. The company has likened developments of 2D materials like graphene to what it is pursuing with new materials for contact lenses. \nXPANCEO integrates over 20 patented technologies in advanced optics, photonics, novel materials, AI, and neural interfaces to produce ultra-compact and highly efficient optoelectronic devices embedded in smart contact lenses.\n\n\n== Recognitions ==\nXPANCEO was recognized as one of the top five optic laboratories in the world by international consulting firm BCG.\nXPANCEO has been nominated for the BOLD Award for developing the first ultra-thin smart contact lenses.\nAccording to Nature, XPANCEO ranked 3rd research institution in physical sciences among UAE research organizations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A fasciole is a thickened spiral band formed by the successive growth lines on the edges of a canal.\nThe term \"anal fasciole\" has been proposed by W.H. Dall in 1885 for the raised ring or band marking the track of the notch that forms a conspicuous feature in the sculpture of some gastropod shells. This is very prominent in turban snails (family Turbinidae). This notch is for the purpose of allowing the effete matters to escape from the anus without fouling the water going to the gills. The anal fasciole is often well-defined and can vary in size and prominence among different species.\nThe term \"siphonal fasciole\", named by Theodore Gill, bears a somewhat similar relation to the anterior end of the siphonal canal, but is generally less distinctly marked  off from the rest of the surface.\nThe notch itself is a break or irregularity in the peristome, denoting the position of the siphon. The term \"anal notch\" may be used in description to distinguish it from the \"siphonal notch\". \n\n\n== References ==",

The imposing 13th-century stone building once the office of appointed town magistrates, still has offices of the local commune, including the communal council, for Volterra, province of Pisa, region of Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History and Description ==\n\nThis building, initially called Palazzo del Comune, was commissioned in 1208 by Ildebrando Pannocchieschi, Palatine Count of the Holy Roman Emperor. The design and construction is attributed to maestro Riccardo da Como; the first floor was completed in 1234, and the upper floors by 1257. Originally, it housed the town leaders, consisting of 24 elders (Anziani), which in 1283 were replaced by 18 Priors of the People (Priori del Popolo), and in 1289 by 12 Defenders of the People (Difensori del Popolo).\nThe stone facade and the tower likely did not receive it merlionated rooflines until the 16th-century. The facade is now decorated with heraldic shields in stone and terracotta belonging to ruling families, often of the appointed Florentine officers after the town became part of the Duchy of Tuscany in 1472. The two lions on columns at the corners of the facade, representing the Marzocco of Florence, were added after this time. The northeast facing facade is oddly asymmetric, with the entrance portal off to the left, the tower off to the right, and the five mullioned windows on the piano nobile, not matching the trios on subsequent levels. The tower was partially rebuilt after the earthquake of 1846.\nOnce the palace housed the local Civic museum and art gallery, but by the 19th-century this museum was moved to the present site of Palazzo Minucci-Solaini. The main portal leads to a large atrium in the ground floor. In the stairs leading up to the next story (first floor), is a fresco depicting a Crucifixion with Saints (1490) by Pier Francesco Fiorentino. The first floor houses the Sala del Consiglio (Hall of the council). This large meeting hall is extensively frescoed with heraldic symbols, completed during a restoration in 1881. A large lunette still retains a partially damaged  Annunciation (1398) painted by Jacopo di Cione Orcagna. The others were completed in 1881. The lunette to the right depicts a Wedding at Cana (1593) by Donato Mascagni. The upper floors were used as a residence by the magistrates.\nThe courtyard once contained a fresco titled Justice (1532) by a young Daniele Ricciarelli; it was detached in 1844 and is now in the town civic museum.\n\n\n== Bibliografia ==\nAnna Padoa Rizzo (a cura di), Arte e committenza in Valdelsa e in Valdera, Florence, Octavo, 1997 ISBN 88-8030-104-7\nA.

He worked for a while in the US and served as a war correspondent during World War I. He also accompanied the Prince of Wales on his tour of India in 1921.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nRobinson was born in Chunar to army chaplain Julian Robinson and Harriet Woodcocke, daughter of Thomas Sharpe, Vicar of Doncaster.

He went to the US where he became a journalist for the New York Tribune, moving to Idaho during the Gold Rush. In 1884 he moved to the Minneapolis Tribune and in 1887 he edited the Northwestern Railroader. In 1895 he published a novel Men Born Equal and in 1896 he campaigned for William McKinley. He moved to England in 1900 and managed the publishing firm of Isbister and Co before it went insolvent four years later.

He also accompanied the Prince of Wales to India in 1921–22. He reported from the Paris Olympics of 1924 and was present in Egypt during the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun.\nRobinson married Mary Lowry in Minneapolis in 1891 and they had two children who died young.

The house was used as a field hospital by the Union Army following the Battle of Bentonville of the American Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Norris-Holland-Hare House was built around 1805 by Needham Norris, a Baptist minister and the son of American Revolutionary War veteran Pvt. John Norris Jr. Needham Norris was the grandfather of the Raleigh socialite Cornelia Alice Norris. The house was constructed on a portion of a land grant given to John Norris Jr. Built in the Federal style, the house features wood sash windows, plain weatherboards, stone foundation piers, and Flemish bond brick chimneys. Norris bequeathed the house and farm to his nephew, Simpson Washington Holland.\nIn September 1864, Holland traveled to Virginia to search for his brother, a Confederate soldier fighting in the American Civil War. Holland died two months later, without having returned home. The widowed Mary Ann Matthews Holland was left to care for their young children.\nIn April 1865, after the Battle of Bentonville, an encampment of Union soldiers encircled the house. The family lived upstairs while the soldiers occupied the first floor as a field hospital.\nThe home later passed to the Hare family, descendants of the Hollands, who owned it until 2004.\nIn 2017, the town purchased the 1,904-square-foot house to save it from demolition, with plans to sell it with preservation requirements. The home was purchased by a family later that year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roberto Giulio Mongeri (1 August 1873 - 30 November 1951) was an Ottoman Empire-born Italian-descent architect. He designed a number of notable buildings in Istanbul during the late period of the Ottoman Empire and in Ankara and other cities of Turkey in the early years of the Turkish Republic as a member of the First national architectural movement. He taught architecture at the School of Fine Arts in Istanbul.\n\n\n== Ancestors ==\nLike many Italian families, the Mongeri family fled the Austrian occupation after the  defeat of the Italians in the Battle of Novara in 1849 during the First Italian War of Independence, and took refuge in the Ottoman Empire. Luigi Mongeri (1818–1882), who studied philosophy and medicine, moved from Crete to Istanbul, then Constantinople. He significantly contributed in the fight against the spread of cholera epidemic in that time. During the reign of Sultan Abdulmejid I (r. 1839–1861), Luigi Mongeri was appointed to a hospital in Istanbul in 1857, and was promoted to the position of the chief physician in 1860. He served also as the personal doctor of the Sultan's sister Adile Sultan (1826–1899). During the reign of Sultan Abdulaziz (r. 1861–1876), he was appointed chief physician of the newly established psychiatric hospital in 1873. He was awarded ordens from The Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\n== Personal life and early years ==\nRoberto Giulio Mongeri was born to Italian-descent Luigi Mongeri and British-descent Tecla Taylor as the youngest child into an Turkish Levantine family in Istanbul on 1 August 1873. He had two brothers Federico and Luigi and a sister Marisa.\nGiulio went to Italy with his sister Marisa, and grew up with his uncles Giuseppe and Michele in Milan, where he started studying at Liceo classico Giuseppe Parini. He then continued his education studying architecture at Accademia di Brera in Milan, where his uncle Giuseppe taught. During his education years between 1893 and 1895, he  took part in architecture project competition and won bronze medal. In 1896, he was honored with the Luigi Clerichetti award. He graduated on 28 October 1896 with an average score of 9.5 out of 10.\nHe then started working in Italy for a grain silo construction at Port of Genoa. In summer holidays, he visited his mother and brother in Istanbul. After completion of the grain silo project, he returned to the Ottoman Empire to pursue a career. In his early years in Istanbul, he joined Società Operaia Italiana di Costantinapoli (Italian Workers' Society of Constantinaple), today Casa Garibaldi (Garibalidı House), and took part in  the architectural works of Italians.\nGiulio Mongeri married to Italian-descent Caterina Capodaini (1877–1900), nicknamed Ketty, he met during a summer holiday in his brother's house on Büyükada, Istanbul. She died during the birth of her first child Guido (1900–1935). Giulio married then Caterina's sister  Cristina (1879–1917). From this marriage,   the five children, Ketty (1904), Alda (1909), Giulio (1910), Elena (1912) and Giovanna (1913), were born. While Elena and her family remained to live in Turkey, other members of the Mongeri family  moved to Italy.\nDuring his stay in Istanbul, he was three times married and had seven children. He lived with his children and the nannies in the beginning in Pera, today Beyoğlu, and later in Şişli in houses he designed and built.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis project designs of a church in Lombardian style, a mansion in Italian Renaissance  style, a mausoleum in Ancient Greek architectural design as well as an inn and a house in modern design were on display at the Istanbul Exhibition in 1903. In 1907, Mongeri was appointed architect of the Italian Embassy in Istanbul, then the capital of the Ottoman Empire. He was selected corresponding member of the Brera Academy in Milan. He became the official architect of the Ottoman Bank in 1911.\nIn 1909, Mongeri was appointed to teach in the Architecture Department at the School of Fine Arts (Ottoman Turkish: Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi), today Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in Istanbul, which was one of the first institutions in the Ottoman Empire under the direction of Osman Hamdi Bey (1842–1910) to provide architectural education in western manner. With the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912), some Italian-origin people in the Ottoman Empire were forced to leave the country. So, the Mongeri's duty was suspended. The Municipality of Milan sent Mongeri a certificate of appreciation for his aid and support to his exiled siblings during the war time. He resumed his teaching duty in the academy in 1922, and served in this position auntil 1930.\nSome of notable Turkish architects he taught are Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu (1888–1982), Macit Rüştü Kural (1899–1964), Şevki Balmumcu (1905–1982), Zeki Sayar (1905–2000),  Sedad Hakkı Eldem (1908–1988) and Hüsnü Tümer.\nIn 1922, he was honored with the Ordine della Corona d'Italia by the Italian Government. He served as the Consultant Architect of the Hungarian Government in 1930.\nMongeri designed a number of notable buildings primarily in Istanbul, but also in Ankara, Bursa and some other cities between 1900s and 1930s. He is considered as an important member of the  First national architectural movement.\n\n\n== Works during the late Ottoman Empire period ==\n\nMongeri's known first work was his design of the Church of St. Anthony  (1906–1912), and apartments, together with Italian-Levantine architect Eduardo de Nari. The buildings he designed during the late years of the Empire in Istanbul were mostly for the Italian cımmunity. Among his works, for he preferred Western eclectic architectural style, are the office building of Assicurazioni Generali (1909), Bulgur Palas (1912), the Majik Cinema (1914–1920), the building of the Italian Embassy (1919), today Consulate-General, Karaköy Palas (1920), and Maçka Palas (1922–1926).\n\n\n== Works during the early Turkish Republican era ==\nAfter the proclamation of the Republic in 1923, he designed buildings in srvrtal cities of Tuurkey becoming a member of the First national architectural movement (1927–1938).\nNotable buildings designed by Mongeri in this era are office buildings of the Ottoman Bank in Ankara, İzmir, and Mersin. headquarters of Ziraat Bank in Ankara (1926–1929), and its office buildings in \nEskişehir (1926), Adana (1930), Aydın, office building of Türk Ekonomi Bankası in İzmir (1927–1928), office buildings in Ankara of Tekel (1928), İşbank (1929), Spa Hotel Çelik Palas (1930–1935) in Bursa.\nHe used more ornamentation for the interior and façade of the buildings in Ankara than other Turkish architects of his time. He designed the ceilings of the buildings covered with the new materials steel and glass. The ceilings of the headquarters of Ziraat Bank and İşbank were decorated with stained glass of European floral motfs. His known last design was for the Spa Hotel Çelik Palas in Bursa.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\nAfter 1933, Mongeri did not involve in any architectural activities. The importance he gave to the garden of his mansion on Güzelbahçe Sokak (literally: Beautiful Garden Street) in Teşvikiye, Şişli shows his love for nature and flowers. He devoted himself to philately and painting.\nIn 1941, Mongeri moved to Venice, Italy to live with his daughters Alda and Giovanna. He started painting and drawing. Two paintings from 1942 named Laguna and Lido di Venezia signed by him are known to exist. There are many drawings of Venetian fountains and arches found in his drawing pad.\nIn 1951, Mongeri went back to Istanbul to visit his duaghter Elena. He stayed two months, and had cataract surgery in that time.\nAfter his return to Venice the same year, Giulio Mongeri died at the age of 78 on 30 November 1951. He was buried in the family tomb at Cimitero Monumentale di Milano. On 5 December, a spiritual service was held in his memory at the Church of St. Anthony in Istanbul he had co-designed.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Bennington is a 1953 oil painting by the American outsider painter Grandma Moses, produced at age 93 and signed \"Moses\".\nIt has been in the collection of the Bennington Museum since 2014.\nIt shows the artist's impression of The Battle of Bennington, with the central portion being a map of the various positions of the participants in the fight itself. To the right behind the mountain is the Bennington Battle Monument, which is impossibly reflected in the Hoosic river, which winds around on the side of the battlefield and flows beneath her beloved covered bridge of Cambridge. The winding river and the shadow of the monument suggest the artist's intent to connect the events of the battle with larger activities involved in the Saratoga campaign. Originally commissioned by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1953, it was rejected for having the modern monument included. In typical Grandma Moses fashion, she did not retouch the painting but obligingly painted another one, which was accepted and most recently put on show and featured in the 2012 \"By, For, and Of the People: Folk Art and Americana\" exhibition of the DAR Museum.\nThis painting is one of five Bennington-related paintings that Grandma Moses made, three of which are in the Bennington collection.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\nBennington, a 1953 painting of the town of Bennington by Grandma Moses in the Bennington Museum, featuring a relocation of the monument next to the museum itself.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the painting in the 1975 abridged version of Otto Kallir's 1973 catalogue raisonné\nOtto Kallir, Grandma Moses, Complete edition, New York, Harry N.

        "content": "Amy Rowntree OBE (13 July 1885 – 4 March 1962) was a Tasmanian educationist who introduced kindergarten techniques to Tasmania. She was also a writer and she and two of her sisters founded Nattyna Heritage Museum in 1957.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRowntree was born in the Tasmanian capital of Hobart. Her parents were Ann Maria (born Fearnley) and Francis Rowntree who was an engineer. She was one of eight children and her brother Edward Fearnley Rowntree was a notable pilot and engineer.\nIn 1912, the New South Wales government had sent Martha Simpson to Europe to learn about the Montessori Method of education from Maria Montessori. These principles were practiced at the demonstration school and in 1912 to 1913 Rowntree was at Teachers' College, Sydney learning from Simpson.\nThe Elizabeth Street Practising School was in Tasmania and in 1919 she became the \"mistress of method\" of the school looking after infant teaching and she became Tasmania's first Inspector of Infant Schools. In the same year she graduated from the University of Tasmania and two years later she was awarded a master's degree. Rowntree was a role model for aspiring professional women. She said that she gave up some the \"joys of womanhood\" but she also experienced travel to Europe and North America as part of her career. She retired in 1945 and in 1949 she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.\nIn retirement she took an interest in local history and she wrote eight books. In 1957 the Nattyna Heritage Museum opened and she and two of her sisters, Fearn and Milli were the main people who inspired its creation. Amy became ill in 1961 and after her death in 1962 her sister (and her illustrator) Fearn helped her last books to be published. Rowntree had died in Battery Point in 1962.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "The 2024 Israeli protests are a series of protests, civil unrest and riots against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his administration, primarily sparked by the ongoing war on Gaza, pressuring Netanyahu to ceasefire and accept an hostage deal. These protests began sporadically at the onset of the war and have significantly grown in size and intensity, culminating in massive gatherings across various Israeli cities.\nIsrael also experienced anti-war protests, and anti-humanitarian aid protests, although they were smaller in scale.\n\nMany in the protests are left-leaning, and are against the escalation of the war, calling for a ceasefire and a prisoner exchange. Many are saying Netanyahu is \"intentionally sabotaging hostage deals\", for his own political survival.\n\n\n== Background ==\nProtests against Netanyahu and his government started after he tried to delay his trial. these protests were called the Black Flags Protests, and later were called \"Balfour Protests\".\nThe second wave of protests came in response to the government's push for a wide-ranging judicial reform, aimed to change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, ultimately cancelling Judiciary in the state. these protests called the reform \"dictatorship\" and were the biggest in the history of Israel.\nThe current third wave of the protests pressuring Netanyahu to accept hostage deal and resign. the protestors are accusing Netanyahu, saying he's a major factor in Israel's deterioration over the years, ultimately causing 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 5 November 2023, thousands rallied in Tel Aviv for hostages deal, and some were also protesting in Jerusalem.\nOn 28 January 2024, police arrested several protesters in Kaplan Square in the Tel Aviv, while hundreds were dispersed by force.\nOn 2 April 2024, a protest outside Netanyahu's residence turned into clashes with police. Five people were arrested and one officer was injured in the melee.\nOn 6 April 2024, during an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv, a car deliberately accelerated into a crowd of protesters, injuring five.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shishkin (4 April 2014 – 28 April 2024) was an Irish-bred British-trained thoroughbred racehorse who competed in National Hunt races. A dual Cheltenham Festival winner, he  won 14 of his 21 races including six Grade 1s with his best performance generally regarded as the Clarence House Chase victory over Energumene. He was trained by Nicky Henderson and ridden by Nico de Boinville.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nAfter two point-to-points in 2018, Shishkin began racing under rules with a bumper win at Kempton in March 2019. He raced as a novice hurdler during the 2019/20 season, falling on his hurdling debut at Newbury, before securing a maiden win a month later. After a 11-length success in the Sidney Banks Memorial Novices' Hurdle he was favourite for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham. His odds drifted on the eve of the Festival but Shishkin overcame a \"troubled passage\" during the race to win in a photo finish from Abacadabras.\nShishkin was switched to fences for the 2020/21 season, in novice chase company he had three easy victories prior to the Cheltenham Festival including in the Wayward Lad and Lightning Novices' Chase. He began the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham as odds-on favourite and delivered an impressive 12-length victory. A fifth success of the season followed at Aintree with the Maghull Novices' Chase.\nShishkin's start to the 2021/22 season was delayed with Henderson choosing not to run him in the Tingle Creek Chase. He re-appeared at Kempton for the Desert Orchid Chase where he record a ninth straight victory. He then faced unbeaten Irish two-miler chaser Energumene in a much anticipated clash in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot. Energumene led and set a strong pace throughout with Shishkin working hard to keep in touch, he cleared the last fence still trailing but kept on to win by a length. Jockey de Boinville rated it as one of the best races he had ridden in. Both horses lined-up for a rematch in the Queen Mother Champion Chase but Shishkin put in a disappointing performance and was pulled up halfway through the race. The initial reason for this was the heavy ground but later tests showed that Shishkin had a rare bone condition.\nShishkin returned to racing seven months later at the Tingle Creek, after finishing a distance third Henderson assessed that he now needed to race further than two miles. His next race was the Ascot Chase, the longer distance of two miles five furlongs bringing about a return to form as he won by 16 lengths. A month later at the Cheltenham Festival he made several jumping errors in finishing second to Envoi Allen in the Ryanair Chase. His season concluded with a first run over three miles in the Aintree Bowl, which he won after rallying late on to beat Ahoy Senor.\nThe 2023/24 season for Shishkin was set to begin with the 1965 Chase at Ascot but the horse planted himself at the start and refused to race. His next outing, the King George VI Chase, was no less eventual as he led by a length jumping the second last fence before stumbling and unseating jockey de Boinville. Shishkin returned to winning ways with victory in the Denman Chase which left Henderson to target the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was among a number of Henderson horses withdrawn from their Festival races after an unsatisfactory scope. He came fourth in the Aintree Bowl on 11 April 2024, in what would prove to be his final race. Henderson announced the death of Shishkin on 28 April 2024 which was as a result of fracturing his hind leg after getting stuck in his box.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sanusi (born 20 May 1960) is an Indonesian politician of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle who has served as the regent of Malang Regency in East Java since 2018. He was previously vice regent between 2016 and 2018, when the regent Rendra Kresna was arrested. Between 1999 and 2014, he served in the regency's legislature as a member of the National Awakening Party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSanusi was born on 20 May 1960 in Gondanglegi village in Malang Regency. His parents were sugarcane farmers. He studied in his home village, graduating from a teachers's school before later receiving a degree from Sunan Ampel State Islamic Institution in Surabaya, later also receiving a master's degree from an economic institute in Yogyakarta.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating, Sanusi worked as an English teacher at a state-funded Islamic High School at his home village, and was also active in the sugarcane industry. According to Sanusi, his parents and his local kyai initially disallowed him from taking a job as a government employee because duties levied by the government on haram alcohol and prostitution would be included in his salary.\nHe joined the Nahdlatul Ulama-affiliated GP Ansor organization, by 1998 becoming its leader at Gondanglegi. The following year, he became chairman of the National Awakening Party (PKB; also Nahdlatul Ulama affiliated) in Gondanglegi. Sanusi ran for a seat in the Malang Regency Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) in the 1999 election, and was elected, becoming head of PKB's parliamentary group. He was reelected for his second and third terms in 2004 and 2009, during which he became deputy speaker of the DPRD. By 2010, he was chairman of PKB's branch in Malang Regency.\nIn the 2015 regency election, he ran as the running mate of Rendra Kresna, and the pair won with 605,817 votes (51.6%). They were sworn in on 17 February 2016. On 15 October 2018, Kresna was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission under bribery charges, and Sanusi became acting regent the following day. Sanusi was sworn in as full regent on 17 September the following year. \nSanusi initially registered to run for a full term in the 2020 regency election as a PKB member, but as PKB refused to endorse him, he moved to the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. He proceeded to win the election with Didik Gatot Subroto as running mate, securing 530,449 votes (45.5%) in a three-way race. They were sworn in on 26 February 2021. As regent, Sanusi has ordered a review into recipients of a municipally-funded free healthcare program on top of the  national healthcare program, claiming that the program's cost was five times the regency government's capability of funding it. He also signed the regency on for a pilot project to eliminate plastic waste.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHe is married to Anis Zaidah Wahyuni, and they have four children.\n\n\n== References ==",

It determined the champion of the 1986–87 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Tennessee Lady Volunteers and the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters. The game was played on March 29, 1987, at the Frank Erwin Center in Austin, Texas. After leading 33–24 at halftime, No. 7 Tennessee pulled away to defeat No. 3 Louisiana Tech 67–44 to capture the program's first NCAA national championship. Tonya Edwards was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Tennessee Lady Volunteers ===\n\nThe Lady Vols, who represented the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, were led by head coach Pat Summitt in her 13th season at the school. Tennessee began the season ranked No. 3 in the AP Poll. After peaking at No. 1 in the polls for the last three weeks of 1986, the team remained in the top 10 all season long and finished the regular season at No. 7 in both major polls.\nPlaying as the No. 2 seed in the Mideast region of the NCAA tournament, the Lady Volunteers defeated Tennessee Tech, No. 11 Virginia, and No. 2 Auburn to reach the fourth Final Four in program history. In the National semifinals, Tennessee defeated No. 4 Long Beach State, 74–64. The 27–6 Lady Vols entered the matchup with No. 3 Louisiana Tech as the underdog.\n\n\n=== Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters ===\n\nThe Lady Techsters, who represented the Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana, were led by head coach Leon Barmore, in his 2nd season as head coach at the school. Louisiana Tech opened the season ranked No. 2 in the AP poll and, like Tennessee, spent the entirety of the season inside the top 10. They finished the regular season ranked No. 3 in both major polls.\nIn the NCAA tournament, La Tech defeated Northwestern, Southern Illinois, and No. 9 Iowa to reach the fourth NCAA Final Four in program history. They won 79–75 over No. 1 and defending National champion Texas in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game with a 30–2 record.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alapata Apata, a satirical play by Wole Soyinka mocking Nigerian politics through the story of Alaba, a retired butcher. As Alaba adjusts to his newfound leisure, the play exposes the absurdities of power dynamics and political manipulation in Nigeria. With humor and wit, Soyinka critiques corruption and hypocrisy, offering a sharp commentary on governance while entertaining readers with its humorous portrayal of characters and situations.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story follows Alaba, a skilled butcher who unexpectedly retires to live atop a rock. His reputation in the butchering business precedes him, yet his retirement bewilders many who cannot fathom why someone successful would choose idleness on a rock.\nUnknown to Alaba, the rock he now calls home hides valuable resources desired by political figures. His presence there sparks various interpretations and interests in society. Some view him as a prophet, while others see him as a threat or a tool for their own agendas.\nThe narrative focuses on themes of greed, corruption, and societal decay, symbolized by Alaba's unconventional retirement spot. Through Alaba's character Soyinka delivers a powerful message about seeking solutions within ourselves and combating ignorance and corruption that hinder progress.\nThe play also highlights the importance of attention to detail, as seen in the teacher's mistake with tonal marks, and reflects on the impact of modern technology on justice and truth.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nCorruption and Power: The play delves into the pervasive corruption within Nigerian society, particularly among political leaders and government officials. Alaba's unwitting interference with their interests exposes the lengths to which they will go to maintain their power and exploit resources for personal gain.\nGreed and Moral Decay: Alaba's retirement to a seemingly idle life on top of a rock contrasts sharply with the greed and moral decay depicted in other characters, especially those in positions of authority. His contentment stands in stark contrast to the insatiable desire for wealth and power displayed by others.\nMisinterpretation and Conflicting Interests: The different interpretations of Alaba's actions by various characters highlight the complexity of human perception and the clash of interests within society. Whether seen as a threat, a spiritual figure, or a mere nuisance, Alaba's presence sparks conflicting agendas and misunderstandings among those around him.\nThe Search for Truth and Revelation: Through Alaba's character, the play explores the theme of seeking truth and revelation. While some characters, like the Pastor, believe Alaba's retirement holds spiritual significance, others recognize the hidden potential and resources beneath the surface, symbolizing the quest for deeper understanding and enlightenment.\n\n\n== Settings ==\nthe settings of this play waves from Alaba's humble butcher shop to the symbolic sanctuary of the rock, each location plays a pivotal role in shaping the narrative landscape.The play set its location at Alaba's Butcher Shop, a humble yet significant setting where the protagonist's expertise and reputation are established, setting the stage for the play.\nOn a Rock, a serene retreat from the chaos of society, Alaba finds solace and tranquility. However, the hidden riches beneath the rock become the reason for conflict, placing  him against others.\nThe Government Offices stand as a contrast, symbolizing power and corruption. Here, political machinations collide with Alaba's peaceful existence, highlighting the struggle between personal integrity and systemic greed.\nIn The Pastor's Church, the spiritual dimension intersects with the narrative, offering insight into Alaba's journey towards enlightenment amidst the turmoil of his surroundings.\nWithin the broader Community, diverse perspectives converge, reflecting the complexity of Nigerian society. From the herbalist to the mechanic, each character offers a unique lens through which to view Alaba's actions and their implications.\nEducational Institutions briefly surface, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and attention to detail in navigating societal complexities, while modern elements like Media and Technology underscore the influence of digital advancements on perception and communication.\nTogether, these settings create a multi-layered backdrop that enhances the thematic depth of the novel, exploring themes of corruption, power, and the quest for truth in Nigerian society.\n\n\n== References ==",

He applied five times to join the prestigious local Hoàng Anh Gia Lai Academy, but he failed all his attempts. In 2016, he temporarily signed Hoàng Anh Gia Lai under-15 side because the team lacked players for the national championship but was released by the club after the tournament ended.\nIn 2017, Văn Hữu joined the SHB Đà Nẵng youth academy. He was promoted to the first team in 2022 and was an important substitute player for the team. However, he had fewer game time in the 2023 season due the club's bad results. SHB Đà Nẵng ended the season in the last place and relegated to the V.League 2.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn January 2022, Văn Hữu took part in the 2022 AFF U-23 Championship with Vietnam national under-23 team. He appeared in the opening game against Singapore, assisted twice in a 7–0 win. After the match, he tested positive for Covid-19 and was removed from the squad.

Makgolokwe-a-Mafehleng are found in Lekwa region where Free State, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces of South Africa meet. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nKgosikgolo Lehasa II ascended to the throne in 2015 after the regency of his Grandmother. He has five siblings: a sister and four brothers.\nSince his ascendance to the throne, he has been pushing efforts to unite the Kholokoe tribe that have been dispersed and its history wiped by the government during colonial times and worked hard to restore culture. The Kholokoe are part of Bakgatla of the Great King Tabane who gave birth to Bakgatla ba Mutsha, Bakgatla ba Mmakau, Bapedi, Makholokoe, Batlokoa, Baphuthing, Basia and Bavhenda. They are one of the tribes who were dispossessed of their land and treated with the most contempt by the colonial government. The splitting of the Kholokoe tribe came from numerous battles both within and waged against them by others, the Makgolokwe-A-Mafehleng clan broke away from the main tribe after the battle with the Nhlapo people in 1821 where King Polane and his son Selotolotsa (son from the senior house) were killed., Sebobane (son of Selotolotsa) was taken into hiding in Heidelberg where he grew up amongst the Bafokeng and was mentored into his role of leading Makgolokwe-A-Mafehleng in 1846 at the age of 26.\nKgosikgolo Lehasa II's belief was that African Royals needed to stand for themselves independently from the governments as the two systems did not share the same values, so he began fostering relations between African Royals beyond the borders of the individual countries. With the understanding and passion of entrepreneurship, he started encouraging tribes to create economies that would see them grow stronger economically and therefore transform their Kingdoms and remove reliance by Royals on politicians\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn his career, Kgosikgolo Lehasa II is a successful entrepreneur who has won multiple awards, a published author, and mentor to many other upcoming entrepreneurs. He has served in national roles to improve the quality of lives for many South Africans, which won him the title of Southern African Quality Champion.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nHe is the descendant of the house of Lehasa I of Makholokoe, the lineage of Makgolokwe-A-Mafehleng is a direct lineage of the Kholokoe Tribe Kingship.\n\nTabane (1540)\nKgetsi (1565)\nMoloi/Mokete (1585)\nHlabathe (1605)\nSehoaba (1625)\nTjale (1645)\nTsoleli (1665)\nMotsoane (1685)\nMokholoane/Mokhoaba (1705)\nMatsemela (1730)\nLehasa/Matholela I(1750)\nPolane (1770)\nSelotolotsa (1795)\nSebobane (1818)\nKgabele (1838)\nSefenya (1856)\nMatebele (1881)\nNaka-la-none/Kgeya (1910)\nTshele (1939)\nMatholela (1979)\n\n\n=== Parents ===\nLetsielo Moloi (father)\nSeipati Mondi (mother)\n\n\n=== Siblings ===\nTumelo Mohaka (brother) - (born 1969; died 1997)\nBolawana Mohaka (sister) - deceased\nPrince Kgeya Moloi (brother)\nPrince Motsamai Moloi (brother)\nPrince Gauta Moloi (brother)\n\n\n=== Children ===\nPrince Kgopotso (son) - (born 2002; died 2020)\nPrincess Lebo (born 2005; died 2005)\nPrincess Refiloe (daughter)\nPrince Tau (son)\nPrincess Lesego (daughter)\nPrincess Lethabo (daughter)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "During closing stages of the Soviet–Japanese War in August 1945, Japanese Kwantung Army still resisted with strong fortifications in Hutou Fortress. The Red Army, with the cooperation of the fighters of the Chinese forces, on August 26, 1945, the finally captured the Fort. As the Hutou battle ended, Japan's unconditional surrender came 11 days later. Only 53 of the 1,400 Japanese soldiers survived one of the last campaigns of the Second World War. A Study on the Hutou Fortress Battle between Japan and the Soviet Union took place in 2009, by the Social Science Academy of Heilongjiang Province, entitled \"The end of World War II\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Japan regarded the Soviet Union as its greatest potential adversary. in 1931, after the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded the north-east of China, it formed a direct confrontation with the Soviet Army on the Sino-Soviet border. In order to strengthen the preparation for war against the Soviet Union, since 1934, the Japanese Kwantung Army built 17 fortresses, totalling more than 80,000 permanent fortifications, in the 5,000-kilometre border strip starting from Hunchun in Jilin Province in the east, passing through the Sino-Soviet border in Heilongjiang Province in the centre, and extending to Hailar and Arshan in Inner Mongolia in the west.\nIn order to deal with the Soviet Far East Front, the Japanese Kwantung Army in the East Manchuria region to build the most intensive fortress, accounting for more than half of the total number of fortresses. Among them, the largest is the Tiger's Head Fortress.\nHutou Fortress is located in Heilongjiang Province, Hulin County, Hutou Town, around the hills of the Wunda Mountains, from the west of the Firestone Mountains, east to the Ussuri River. The fortress area is 12 kilometres wide at the front and 6 kilometres deep at the back, consisting of five positions on Mangtu Mountain, Tiger North Mountain, Tiger East Mountain, Tiger West Mountain and Tiger Tsunami Mountain, each of which is connected by pits and traffic trenches. Because of its large scale, complex structure, complete facilities, by the Japanese Kwantung Army boasted as the ‘Oriental Maginot Line’. 1934 to 1939, the Japanese Kwantung Army for the construction of the Tiger's Head Fortress, cost hundreds of millions of dollars, using hundreds of thousands of Chinese labourers and prisoners of war. These labourers were transported to the fortress as if they had entered hell on earth. They were not clothed, not fed, and worked more than ten hours a day with heavy physical labour, and countless labourers died of exhaustion, illness and were killed.\nIn March 1939, the Japanese Kwantung Army established the 4th Border Guard brigade and stationed it at the Hutou Fortress. 1941 was the heyday of the Hutou Fortress Guard, with its troop strength increasing to 12,000 men and its weaponry being significantly strengthened. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese army put the strategic focus on the southern battlefield, and constantly from the Kwantung Army, resulting in a substantial decline in the strength of the Kwantung Army, a serious shortage of troops, the force equipped with elasticity, the fortress garrison continued to shrink. Before the Soviet Army attacked the Tiger's Head Fortress, the Japanese Kwantung Army's 15th Border Guard brigade stationed at the fortress had only more than 1,400 soldiers and a small amount of equipment and ammunition.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nWith the declaration of war on Japan by the Soviet Union on 8 August 1945 and the start of the invasion in the early hours of 9 August, fighting broke out between the 15th Border Garrison at Tiger Head Fortress and the invading Soviet troops. As the garrison commander, Army Colonel Takeshi Nishiwaki, was on a business trip to the 5th Army Headquarters and could not return to his unit, the artillery commander, Army Captain Tadashi Ohki, took command as acting garrison commander. A large number of civilian Japanese residents from the surrounding area were also evacuated to the fortress, resulting in a total of approximately 1800 people being caged in. According to one theory, 1,400 civilians were evacuated, thus bringing the total number of civilians to nearly 3,000. However, many of the civilians were women and girls due to the 'uprooting mobilisation'. The Type 90 train atrillery was dismantled for transportation to Tonga and could not be bombarded, but the 41 cm howitzers shelled the railway bridge on the Siberian Railway's Iman diversions line and continued shelling the Soviet troops until the gun's barrel was disabled on the 19th due to a cavity in the gun barrel.\nThe Soviet Army, with about 20,000 men in two divisions, set about capturing the fortress. The surrounding Kwantung Army was in retreat and the garrison was isolated and desperate, but it is not clear to what extent the garrison itself understood this. On 15 August, the garrison heard the announcement of the Gyokuon-broadcast, but regarded it as a conspiracy; on 17 August, five Japanese prisoners of war, as military envoys of the Soviet Army, informed the Japanese Government of their unconditional surrender and negotiated a ceasefire to disarm them, but the Soviets refused as a conspiracy; one of the garrison officers beheaded the local branch chairman of the Zainogun-kai, who was also a military envoy; on 18 August, a Japanese officer was killed by the Soviet Army, who had been a member of the Soviet Army. The Soviets then proceeded to negotiate a ceasefire, but this was rejected as a plot. The Soviet army did not send any more military envoys after that and is believed to have adopted a policy of thorough annihilation unless the Japanese surrendered.\nSoviet troops also attacked underground facilities by pouring petrol into them, igniting it and sending the smoke through a blower to kill Japanese soldiers through carbon monoxide poisoning. On 26 August, the Hutou Fortress fell completely. Only 53 survivors are reported to have survived. The Japanese had boldly stated that Hutou Fortress would be able to fight for more than half a year, but it could only hold out for more than half a month due to insufficient forces. The Battle of Tiger Head Fortress, which was a fierce battle because of this, is said to be the last fierce battle of the Second World War on the Japanese side (on the Soviet side, many people think of the end of the Second World War as the end of the German-Soviet War, and the Soviet-Japanese war started afterwards and the battle itself ended after less than a month, so there is a general lack of interest.)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"A Charge to Keep I Have\" is a hymn written by Charles Wesley. It was first published in 1762 in Wesley's Short Hymns on Select Passages of the Holy Scriptures. The words are based on Leviticus 8:35. It is most commonly sung to the hymn tune Boylston by Lowell Mason.\n\n\n== History ==\n\"A Charge to Keep I Have\" was first published as hymn number 188 in Charles Wesley's 1762 anthology, Short Hymns on Select Passages of the Holy Scriptures. This collection included various hymns on each book of the Bible. The hymn is one of 21 inspired by verses from the Book of Leviticus. \"A Charge to Keep I Have\" was later included in A Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called Methodists, published in 1780 by Charles's brother John Wesley. It was, though, removed from the second edition of Short Hymns in 1794.\nThe words were inspired by Leviticus 8:35, in which God, through Moses, gives instructions to Aaron and his sons, for their service as priests. He commands them to \"keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not.\" Other Bible verses reflected in the words include Hosea 6:2, Matthew 25:30, 1 Corinthians 4:2 and 2 Peter 1:10.\n\nWesley's words draw closely on Matthew Henry's commentary on Leviticus 8:31–36, first published in 1706:We have every one of us a charge to keep, an eternal God to glorify, an immortal soul to provide for, needful duty to be done, our generation to serve; and it must be our daily care to keep this charge, for it is the charge of the Lord our Master, who will shortly call us to an account about it, and it is at our peril if we neglect it. Keep it ‘that ye die not’; it is death, eternal death, to betray the trust we are charged with.\nHymnologist Erik Routley described Wesley's use of Henry's commentary as \"a very unusual manner of treating Scripture,\" asserting: \"I cannot recall any other example of a hymn writer taking down a commentary and putting its contents into verse.\"\n\n\n== Text ==\n\n\n=== Original words ===\nIn its original form, the hymn has two stanzas, each containing eight lines, written in double short meter (66.86 D). \n\nIn most hymnals, the stanzas are divided into two, to create two verses with four lines each.\n\n\n=== Final lines ===\nThe final two lines are changed in several hymnbooks, to remove the reference to eternal death for apostasy (\"I shall for ever die\"). In the 1904 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, the lines were changed to:\n\nIn the 1983 Methodist hymn book Hymns and Psalms, they were changed to:\n\nThe verse has also been changed to read:\n\n\n== Tune ==\nThe hymn is most commonly sung to the tune Boylston, composed in 1832 by Lowell Mason. This tune was originally published in The Choir or Union Collection of Church Music, as music for a hymn entitled \"Our Days are as Grass.\" In Methodist hymnals, \"A Charge to Keep I Have\" has sometimes been paired with St Thomas, written by Aaron Williams, or Cambridge, by Ralph Harrison, both composed in the 18th century.  \n\n\n== Modern Usage ==\nThe hymn remains popular, and is included in several hymnals across different denominations, including The Song Book of the Salvation Army (1986), The United Methodist Hymnal (1989), The Baptist Hymnal (1991) and Singing the Faith (2011). It has often been used at the end of conferences, to inspire attendees for service.\n\"A Charge to Keep I Have\" became popular in Black churches in America in the 19th and 20th centuries. As with other traditional hymns, the music was significantly altered; Eddie Glaude has described such hymns as being \"radically transformed by haunting and beautiful arrangements.\"\n\nThe hymn has been influential for George W. Bush, who based the title of his 1999 autobiography A Charge to Keep on this hymn. It was also played at the service marking his inauguration as Governor of Texas in 1995. Bush said he was \"particularly impressed\" by the lines: \"To serve the present age, my calling to fulfill / O may it all my powers engage to do my Master's will.\" He saw these words as summarising his mission. A painting with the same name, by W.H.D. Koerner, was loaned to Bush when he became Governor. In a memo to staff, Bush wrote:When you come into my office, please take a look at the beautiful painting of a horseman determinedly charging up what appears to be a steep and rough trail. This is us. What adds complete life to the painting for me is the message of Charles Wesley that we serve One greater than ourselves.\nAn a capella arrangement of the hymn, sung by gospel singer Marion Williams, appears on the soundtrack for the 1991 film Fried Green Tomatoes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maria Dmitrievna Subbotina (Russian: Мария Дмитриевна Субботина; 1854–1878) was a Russian Narodnik revolutionary. Born into a noble family in the Oryol, she was educated in Moscow and moved abroad to study medicine at the University of Zurich. In Switzerland, she became involved in the socialist circles led by Pyotr Lavrov and Mikhail Bakunin, the latter of whom she followed to Zagreb in order to organise among Serbian nationalists planning the Herzegovina uprising. In 1874, she returned to Russia, where she began organising factory works in Ivanovo and Moscow. She was arrested for her activities and tried in the Trial of the 50, which sentenced her to exile in Siberia, although her sentence was lessened to exile in the Volga region, as she had fallen seriously ill. She died of tuberculosis while in exile in Novouzensk.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaria Dmitrievna Subbotina was born in 1854, in the village of Podvorgolskoye, in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. She was the second daughter of a noble landowner, Dmitrii Subbotin, who died shortly after the birth of his youngest daughter Nadezhda, leaving his children with a considerable inheritance. The girls' mother, Sofya Subbotina, endeavoured to provide them with the best possible education, enrolling them at a girls' school in Moscow in 1868.\nShe never formally graduated from school, as in 1872, she decided to follow her older sister Evgeniia and her friend Anna Toporkova in travelling abroad to Zurich, where she enrolled in the medical faculty of the University of Zurich. She quickly came to dislike life in Switzerland, remarking that \"in despotical Russia life is easier. There is not this depressing atmosphere of routine and habit as here in \"free\" Switzerland\". There she joined a Russian student circle led by Pyotr Lavrov, who she became a follower of, working as a typesetter for his magazine Vpered. She also joined the Fritschi women's group.\nWhen the Tsarist government issued a ban on women studying in Zurich, in 1874, she moved to Paris, in order to pursue her medical studies at Sorbonne University. But she didn't end up graduating, as the anarchist revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin had invited her to Zagreb in order to work with local Serbian nationalists, who were in the middle of preparations for the Herzegovina uprising. She and Olga Lyubatovich, both followers of Bakunin, travelled to the Balkans, where they joined a local Serbian socialist organisation.\nTogether with other women from the Zurich socialist group, she subsequently returned to Russia, where they took up political activism. Together with Varvara Alexandrova and Anna Toporkova, she went to work in a factory in Ivanovo and lived together in Toporkova's flat. Subbotina was implicated in the Trial of the 193 due to her mother's arrest in September 1874. She was initially prevented from leaving the Kursk Governorate, but by 19 February 1876, she had been acquitted due to a lack of evidence.\nDuring this time, she moved to Moscow, where she joined the All-Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Organisation. She fell ill with tuberculosis, so was unable to actively participate in its propaganda activities, but oversaw the supplying of propagandists with money and books. On 12 August 1875, her flat in Ivanovo was raided and she was arrested together with Alexandrova and Toporkova. Subbotina was transferred to Moscow, where she was incarcerated in Butyrka prison while awaiting trial. After attempting suicide due to the harsh conditions of her imprisonment, her condition worsened and she was granted compassionate release in 1876.\nBefore long, she had joined back up with the Narodniks and participated in the founding of the Land and Liberty organisation. On 30 November 1876, she was named as a participant in subversive anti-government activities in the Trial of the 50, which saw her arrested again and confined in pre-trial detention. On 14 March 1877, she was found guilty of belonging to an illegal political organisation and sentenced to exile in the Tomsk Governorate, where she would be deprived of her rights and prevented from leaving the province. However, due to the circumstances of her illness, on 14 August 1877, the court accepted an appeal to replace her sentence with exile to the Samara Governorate. In autumn of 1877, she was transferred to Novouzensk, where she died from tuberclosis on 8 February 1878.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Yesterwynde is the upcoming tenth studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, and is set to be released on 20 September 2024 by Nuclear Blast.\nThis is their first studio album since Wishmaster to not feature Marko Hietala following his departure from the band in January 2021, and their first to feature Jukka Koskinen as the new bassist.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Production ===\nHolopainen started sketching drafts for the next Nightwish album through March and April 2021. while he remained busy with side projects Auri and Darkwoods My Betrothed. He confirmed that the band booked a studio for the next album, which was in the summer of 2023 for three months at the Röskö campsite. In March 2022, Holopainen entered the studio, writing demos for the next Nightwish album, which were later finished in June 2022.\nAfter the band had listened to the demos, Jansen, who was at the time, working on her debut solo album Paragon, stated on 10 June 2022 that while the sound of the band would not be lost, the upcoming album would be put in a heavier direction. Holopainen later confirmed that the next album would be both a follow-up to Human. :II: Nature. and both the third and final part of a trilogy which was started from Endless Forms Most Beautiful. After completing the demos in July in an undisclosed location, the band began tracking for the album in August. Hahto later confirmed that he had finished recording eight songs. The band finished recording their instruments in September 2023, with the orchestral arrangements wrapping up the following month. The recording sessions were finished at the end of November 2023. Mixing and mastering began for the album at Finnvox Studios in January 2024, and was later completed at the end of February.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n=== Themes ===\nThe title of the album is a word made by band member Troy Donockley, which Holopainen describes as the feeling of time, history, memory, and being connected to past generation, who have \"all had their lives, their ups and downs, and they don't exist anymore, except as atoms scattered all over the universe. And we're going to be in that state pretty soon as well. So that should give you something to think about.\"\nHolopainen has described the album as being about humanism, history, and the inspiration thereof, and that outlook of the album is positive and optimistic.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe tenth studio album's name, Yesterwynde, was announced on 30 April 2024 along with a release date for 20 September 2024. The first single for the album, called \"Perfume of the Timeless\", will be released on 21 May 2024.\nThere is no tour planned to support the album, as the band is set to go on a hiatus from touring following the album's release, which Hahto had said would last for \"two or three years\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nNightwish\n\nFloor Jansen – lead vocals\nEmppu Vuorinen – guitars\nKai Hahto – drums, percussion\nTuomas Holopainen – keyboards\nTroy Donockley – Uilleann pipes, backing vocals\nJukka Koskinen – bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thermal balance of a diver occurs when the total heat exchanged between the diver and their surroundings results in a stable temperature of the diver. Ideally this is within the range of normal human body temperature. Thermal status of the diver is the temperature distribution and heat balance of the diver. The terms are frequently used as synonyms. Thermoregulation is the process by which an organism keeps its body temperature within specific bounds, even when the surrounding temperature is significantly different.  The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment. If the body is unable to maintain a normal human body temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It occurs when the body loses heat faster than producing it. The core temperature of the body normally remains steady at around 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). Only a small amount of hypothermia or hyperthermia can be tolerated before the condition becomes debiltating, further deviation can be fatal. Hypothermia does not easily occur in a diver with reasonable passive thermal insulation over a moderate exposure period, even in very cold water.\nBody heat is lost by respiratory heat loss, by heating and humidifying (latent heat) inspired gas, and by body surface heat loss, by radiation, conduction, and convection, to the atmosphere, water, and other substances in the immediate surroundings. Surface heat loss may be reduced by insulation of the body surface. Heat is produced internally by metabolic processes and may be supplied from external sources by active heating of the body surface or the breathing gas. Radiation heat loss is usually trivial due to small temperature differences, conduction and convection are the major components. Evaporative heat lodd is also significant to open cirduit divers, not so much for rebreathers.\nHeat transfer to and via gases at higher pressure than atmospheric is increased due to the higher density of the gas at higher pressure which increases its heat capacity. This effect is also modified by changes in breathing gas composition necessary for reducing narcosis and work of breathing, to limit oxygen toxicity and to accelerate decompression. Heat loss through conduction is faster for higher fractions of helium. Divers in a helium based saturation habitat will lose or gain heat fast if the gas temperature is too low or too high, both via the skin and breathing, and therefore the tolerable temperature range is smaller than for the same gas at normal atmospheric pressure. The heat loss situation is very different in the saturation living areas, which are temperature and humidity controlled, in the dry bell, and in the water.\nThe alveoli of the lungs are very effective at heat and humidity transfer. Inspired gas that reaches them is heated to core body temperature and humidified to saturation in the time needed for gas exchange, regardless of the initial temperature and humidity. This heat and humidity are lost to the environment in open circuit breathing systems. Breathing gas that only gets as far as the physiological dead space is not heated so effectively. When heat loss exceeds heat generation, body temperature will fall. Exertion increases heat production by metabolic processes, but when breathing gas is cold and dense, heat loss due to the increased volume of gas breathed to support these metabolic processes can result in a net loss of heat, even if the heat loss through the skin is minimised. \nThe thermal status of the diver has a significant influence on decompression stress and risk, and from a safety point of view this is more important than thermal comfort. Ingassing while warm is faster than when cold, as is outgassing, due to differences in perfusion in response to temperature perception, which is mostly sensed in superficial tissues. Maintaining warmth for comfort during the ingassing phase of a dive can cause relatively high tissue gas loading, and getting cold during decompression can slow the elimination of gas due to reduced perfusion of the chilled tissues, and possibly also due to the higher solubility of the gas in chilled tissues. Thermal stress also affects attention and decision making, and local chilling of the hands reduces strength and dexterity.\n\n\n== Thermal management ==\nThe thermally neutral air temperature for an unprotected resting human is about 28 °C (82 °F), and the thermally neutral temperature in water is about 35 °C (95 °F), much closer to normal body temperature. This difference is due to the very different physical properties of the media. If the metabolic rate is raised, these ambient temperatures will become uncomfortably high.\nThe thermoneutral zone (TNZ) is the range of temperatures of the immediate environment in which a standard healthy adult can maintain normal body temperature without needing to use energy above and beyond normal basal metabolic rate. It starts at approximately 21 °C (69.8 °F) for normal weight men and at around 18 °C (64.4 °F) for those who are overweight, and extends towards circa 30 °C (86.0 °F). This is for a resting human and does not allow for shivering, sweating or exercising. Vasomotor control is the only regulatory mechanism in the thermoneutral zone.Even with light clothing, radiation and convection losses are dramatically reduced, effectively reducing the TNZ. Below the lower critical temperature of the TNZ heat balance can be maintained by 9ncrease in metabolic heat production, including shivering, but above the upper critical temperature, the normal mechanism of evaporative cooling by sweating is not available to divers in the water.\n Water is a far more effective heat source and sink than air and the TNZ is correspondingly narrower and shifted upwards to 33 to 35.5 °C (91.4 to 95.9 °F). In hyperbaric environments the higher gas density, and in the case of helium based gases, higher conductivity, also cause a narrower TNZ.\nThe thermal comfort zone (TCZ) is the range of temperatures  in which a perception of comfort is experienced, and which are regulated by behaviour.\nThe higher rate of heat transfer in water means that for an uninsulated person, the heat loss due to increased movement and the consequent increased convection, is not compensated by the additional metabolic heat output, and after a short period, a swimmer will lose heat more quickly than a person remaining still relative to the water. In practice, some movement may be essential to avoid drowning, When well enough insulated, this tendency will reverse, and exercise will increase body heat faster than it is lost.\nThe insulation provided by surface tissues is mainly dependent on perfusion of those tissues. Reduction of perfusion due to vasoconstriction is a natural response to cold sensation by the skin. High levels of carbon dioxide are a vasodilator, which will counter this vasoconstriction. Not only will heat be lost more quickly, but higher perfusion will cause a faster tissue loading by inert gas when at depth, though the saturation level may not be as high due to solubility changes. Elevated carcon dioxide levels can also increase ventiation, which can contribute to heat loss.\n\n\n=== Factors affecting the thermal status of the diver ===\nAmbient temperature of the water\nMovement of water over the surface of the diver or suit\nAir temperature, before and after the dive.\nWind chill. Increased convective cooling by ambient air\nEvaporative cooling in air\nBreathing gas temperature, density, specific heat, and respiratory minute volume (RMV).\nInsolation when out of the water\nThermal insulation reduces the rate of heat transfer in both directions.\nBasal metabolism produces heat\nExertion, the energy provided by metabolic processes to perform work, also generates heat.\nActive heating, the use of electrical heating elements in undergarments, heat packs, or hot water circulation in an open or closed circuit in the diving suit. and heating of the breathing gas supply.\nActive cooling. In some circumstances the diving environment is too hot for comfort or health and cooling is required. The pre-dive environment can also be too hot, and require cooling, but this is usually relatively simple and can generally be achieved by wetting the outside of the suit for evaporative cooling, and seating the standby diver in shade.\n\n\n=== Emergency heating of divers ===\nThere is a need for emergency heating of divers trapped in a closed diving bell. The breathing gas may be helium based, at a high pressure, and the ambient water temperature may be quite low, down to 2°C, with a typical temperature in the North Sea of about 5°C. The bell itself is usually made of steel, a good thermal conductor, and the quality of bell insulation is variable, so the internal atmosphere tends to match the water temperature fairly soon after the heating fails. Divers trapped in bells for long periods have been subjected to various degrees of hypothermia when the primary heating systems failed. There have been deaths attributed to this cause.\nHeat is lost much faster in a heliox atmosphere at high pressure, and in a dry environment conduction and convection from the body surface and from the lungs are much greater than in normal atmospheric air. Heat loss from the lungs can cause rapid core temperature loss.\nPassive systems were the first to be developed to a stage where they were considered functionally sufficient, and are relatively simple, economical and immediately available. Personal insulation for the diver, in the form of an insulated bag, combined with a breathing gas heat exchanger to conserve the heat of exhaled gas, and heat liberated by a personal carbon dioxide scrubber kept within the insulation layer round the diver is usually sufficient to keep the divers in thermal balance whie waiting for rescue. The scrubber has an orinasal mask, and the bag is secured to the inside of the bell by a harness, to prevent the diver from collapsing if rendered unconscious, and potentially blocking access to the bell by rescuers.\n\n\n== Consequences of chilling and heating ==\nCore temperature reduction will eventually result in hypothermia, but even lesser temperature  drops will cause reduced physical and mental capacity. Peripheral chilling generally causes vasoconstriction, which slows the rate of ingassing and outgassing (washout) in those tissues. This affects the risk of decompression sickness in bounce diving and saturation excursions with significant depth change.\nHand temperature reduction below 15 °C (59 °F) results in loss of hand and finger strength and dexterity which can make the diver unable to perform necessary tasks, or delay getting them done, which can reduce their ability to recover from dangerous incidents, and increase risk of injury or fatality. Maintaining core temperature of the body does not preserve hand temperature or perfusion when the hands are exposed to cold water, even when passive insulation of the hands is provided.\n\n\n=== Overheating ===\n\nIn humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than 37.5–38.3 °C (99.5–100.9 °F), depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body's  temperature set point. The normal human body temperature can be as high as 37.7 °C (99.9 °F).  Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected. Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above 40 °C (104 °F) can be life-threatening.\n\n\n=== Chilling ===\n\nHypothermia is reduced core body temperature that happens when a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs and produces for long enough. Clinical hypothermia occurs when the core temperature drops below 35 °C (95 °F)., though the American Heart Association uses 36 °C (97 °F). Heat loss is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries. Reduced capacity for rational decision making increases risk due to other hazards, and loss of strength in chilled muscles also affects the capacity to manage both routine and emergency situations. Low tissue temperatures and reduced peripheral perfusion affect inert gas solubility and the rate of ingassing and outgassing, thereby affecting decompression stress and risk. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to severe chilling, and eventually hypothermia in inadequately protected divers, although it is not often the direct clinical cause of death.\nMost divers are sufficiently protected by their diving suits that clinical hypothermia is rare for scuba divers, but it is considered a significant hazard for surface supplied saturation divers.\n\n\n== Heat loss ==\nThe rate of heat loss from the human body is a function of subcutaneous fat thickness, but metabolic heat production is not accurately predictable, which is a limitation on predicting the lowest water temperature in which a stable thermal balance can be reached, with or without a given external insulation.\nThe individual metabolic response to a cold environment depends to some degree on the distribution of skin temperature, but also by other factors, including physical fitness and conditioning by prior exposure to low temperatures.\nImmersion in water at 29 °C (84 °F) has been found to not stimulate much metabolic response. Consequently, there is little peripheral vasoconstriction or shivering, which allows faster core cooling, which may progress to approximately 35 °C (95 °F), a temperature at which temporary but serious intellectual impairment occurs, and which is thought to have been a significant factor in some accidents during deep dives using hot water suits. These low core temperatures are not associated with much sensation of cold. The lower limit of safe core temperature for potentially dangerous and complex work can therefore be assumed to be higher than the nominal hypothermia limit of 35 °C (95 °F)\n\n\n=== Breathing gas temperature ===\nInhaled gas is heated to nearly 37 °C (99 °F) and humidified to saturation before it reaches the alveoli, and this humidification requires both additional heat and water. Some of the heat is recovered during exhalation, but there is a net heat loss in most circumstances as the gas is usually relatively cold and dry, particularly open circuit scuba gas which has an extremely low humidity, and temperature commonly below 0 °C (32 °F) at the mouth. Increased gas density due to depth increases this heat loss. Different gas composition also affects heat loss as gases have different specific heats. In this regard, helium based gases have lower specific heat for a given pressure and remove less heat for a given RMV and depth.\nCold breathing gas also causes an increase in airway resistance as it induces contraction of smooth muscles of the airways. Heating of the inspired gas by hot water jacket on the helmet, for surface-supplied divers, or retaining the heat in a reabreather loop reduces this effect and also reduces heat loss. The gas in the rebreather loop is also fully saturated most of the time, reducing heat loss by evaporation.\n\n\n=== Insulation ===\n\nInsulation of the diver is the primary function of most types of diving suit. The two main classes of ambient pressure diving suit are wetsuits and dry suits. Both are effective, but dry suits have a wider range of temperatures in which they are effective than wetsuits.\n\n\n==== Wetsuits ====\n\nWetsuits are close-fitting flexible suits that are typically used where the water temperature is between 10 and 25 °C (50 and 77 °F). The foamed neoprene of the suit thermally insulates the wearer. Although water can enter the suit, a well fitted suit prevents excessive heat loss because little of the water warmed inside the suit escapes from the suit to be replaced by cold water, a process referred to as \"flushing\".\nProper fit is critical for heat retention. A suit that is too loose will allow a large amount of water to circulate over the diver's skin, taking up body heat. A suit that is too tight is very uncomfortable and can impair circulation at the neck, a very dangerous condition which can cause blackouts. For this reason, many divers choose to have wetsuits custom-tailored instead of buying them \"off the rack\". Many suppliers offer this service and the cost is often similar to an off-the-rack suit.\nWetsuits are limited in their ability to retain heat by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10 mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7 mm, 5 mm, 3 mm, and 1 mm. A 1 mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.\n\n\n==== Semi-dry suits ====\nSemi-dry suits are effectively wetsuits with watertight seams and nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck, ankles and zip. They are typically used where the water temperature is between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F). The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains relatively warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple to use compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are usually made from thick expanded neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals having a slick sealing surface in contact with the skin. Two-piece sets tend to be a one piece full length suit, sometimes described as \"long johns\", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.\n\n\n==== Dry suits ====\n\nDry suits are generally used where the water temperature is between −2 and 15 °C (28 and 59 °F). Water is prevented from entering the suit by seals at the neck and wrists and the opening for getting the suit on and off is typically closed by a waterproof zipper. The suit insulates the wearer by maintaining an insulating layer of air in the undersuit between the body and the suit shell, (in exactly the way that thermal insulation garments work above water) or by using a watertight expanded neoprene suit shell, which is inherently insulating in the same way as a wet suit, and which can usually be worn with additional insulating undergarments.\nBoth laminated fabric and neoprene drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, they are quite bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. The woven materials are relatively inelastic and constrain joint mobility unless inflated to a fairly loose fit. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits and are more elastic, but in some cases do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a significant degree of insulation.\nConstant volume dry suits have a system allowing the suit to be inflated to prevent \"suit squeeze\" caused by increasing pressure and to prevent excessive compression of the insulating undergarments. They also have vents allowing the excess air to escape from the suit during ascent.\nFor improved insulation, dry suit users may inflate their suits with argon, an inert gas which has superior thermal insulating properties compared to air and helium. The argon is carried in a small cylinder, separate from the diver's breathing gas. This arrangement is frequently used when the breathing gas contains helium, which is a very poor insulator in comparison with other breathing gases. Argon has 32% lower thermal conductivity than air, but does not always make a significant difference to core temperature or perceived thermal comfort in comparison with air.\n\n\n=== Active heating and cooling ===\nActive heating and cooling uses an artificial heat source or sink to heat or remove excess heat from the diver. A diver can be kept in comfort and thermal equilibrium in a tubesuit garment while immersed in water from 10 to 40 °C (50 to 104 °F), using a  flow of water at 30 °C (86 °F). Available technology includes closed and open circuit water circulation, electrical heating elements worn inside the diving suit, and chemical heating and cooing packs. Active heating and cooling is often used in conjunction with passive insulation, and usually when passive insulation is inadequate or inconvenient, or insufficiently adaptable to variable conditions during a planned dive.\n\n\n==== Hot water suits ====\n\nHot water suits are loose fitting neoprene wetsuits used in cold water commercial surface-supplied diving. A hose in the diver's umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater at the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary the warmth of the suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn to extend heating to the extremities. Breathing gas heating at the helmet is available by using a hot water shroud over the helmet inlet piping between the valve block and the regulator. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design, and need not be very thick, as their primary function is to temporarily retain and guide the flow of the heating water. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.\nHot water suits are often used for deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much more efficiently than air, which means that the diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Loss of heated water supply for hot water suits can be a life-threatening emergency with a high risk of debilitating hypothermia. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes. Depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly, particularly as decompression efficiency is reduced by a drop in body temperature.\nHeated water in the suit forms an active insulation barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32 °C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45 °C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, and in the early stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.\nThe hot-water suit is normally a one-piece neoprene wetsuit, fairly loose fitting, to fit over a thin neoprene undersuit, which can protect the diver from scalding if the temperature control system fails, with a zipper on the front of the torso and on the lower part of each leg. Gloves and boots are worn which receive hot water from the ends of the arm and leg hoses. If a full-face mask is worn, the hood may be supplied by a tube at the neck of the suit. Helmets do not require heating. The heating water flows out at the neck and cuffs of the suit through the overlap with gloves, boots, or hood.: ch18 \n\n\n== Overheating ==\nOverheating is much less common than excessive heat losss, but there are situations where commercial divers must dive in hot water. In these cases it is necessary for the diver to be actively chilled, as insulation alone cannot reduce the temperature of the diver. Sweating is the mechanism normally used to cool the body when the temperature rises above 37 °C (99 °F), but it is ineffective in water, as the sweat cannot evaporate, and in a dry suit the internal gas as saturated in a very short time, after which no further evaporation can occur. A system using vests chilled with ice has been tested successfully, and tubesuits chilled with water at 30 °C (86 °F) have been tested in ambient water temperatures of up to 40 °C (104 °F). As in the case of excessive heat loss, effective insulation of the diver inside a chilled suit will minimise the cooling load. The effects of hyperthermia on diver performance and physiology are incompletely understood, particularly during exercise.\n\n\n== Influence on risk ==\n\n\n=== Direct physiological and medical risk ===\nThe temperature of the diver's body or parts thereof affects the short term risk of: \n\nDecompression sickness, by affecting the rates of ingassing and outgassing of tissues by affecting solubility in the tissues and by affecting perfusion of the tissues.\nHypothermia; particularly due to core heat loss through cold, dense breathing gas, and due to depressing vasoconstriction by superficial warming which may cause core temperature afterdrop.\nImmersion pulmonary oedema; vasoconstriction increases central blood volume.\nNon-freezing cold injury; usually of the hands, due to low perfusion when the body is cold and vasoconstiction increases heat loss, and limited insulation to allow sufficient dexterity to operate essential equipment.\nFrostbite; above the surface in sub-freezing temperatures, mostly to exposed areas.\nHeat exhaustion and heatstroke; in hot water and in hot surface conditions before the dive.\n\n\n==== Effects of diver temperature on decompression risk ====\n\nThe thermal status of the diver has a significant influence on decompression stress and risk, and from a safety point of view this is more important than thermal comfort. Ingassing while warm is faster than when cold, as is outgassing, due to differences in perfusion in response to temperature perception, which is mostly sensed in superficial tissues. Maintaining warmth for comfort during the ingassing phase of a dive can cause relatively high tissue gas loading, and getting cold during decompression can slow the elimination of gas due to reduced perfusion of the chilled tissues, and possibly also due to the higher solubility of the gas in chilled  tissues.\nThe natural variation of diver temperature and heat distribution over time during a dive is opposite to the theoretically preferred variation, as a comfortably warm diver descending into cold water while well insulated, will spend the first part of the dive warmer than optimal, possibly performing sufficient work to maintain core and peripheral temperature, induce high perfusion to the muscles involved, and ingas fast, while during the ascent and decompression, a significant amount of heat may have already been lost, the peripheral tissues may be poorly perfused, and the diver will not generally be exercising much. These factors will slow outgassing in comparison with the ingassing rate of the dive. The chilled tissues may also be slower to outgas due to increased gas solubility at lower temperatures.\nWhen the diver feels cold during an ascent, outgassing is probably compromised by vasoconstriction, and to reduce decompression risk they should extend decompression time in spite of prolonging the discomfort, rather than try to get out as soon as possible. External active heating while there is a fairly deep chilling of the surface layers could induce skin bends due to solubility changes in the surface tissues if the heating is too fast for perfusion to wash out excess inert gas. Light exercise during decompression can warm the diver slightly, and increase perfusion, which can help with outgassing, but heavy exercise may trigger bubble formation in the joints.\n\n\n==== Thermal management to limit decompression stress ====\nDecompression stress can be limited by following a specific thermal management strategy: In the period leading up to a dive, the diver should avoid unnecessary exercise and warming up that would increase peripheral perfusion in the ingassing sector of the dive. Sufficient passive insulation is needed to prevent excessive heat loss, but active heating of the surface tissues should be avoided or minimised while in the ingassing stages of the dive, to allow cold response vasoconstriction, which will limit both core heat loss and peripheral tissue ingassing. During ingassing, exercise should also be limited to what is necessary. During the ascent and decompression, slow and gentle active rewarming and mild exercise at a level that does not induce bubble formation and growth. can improve inert gas washout. After the dive, active superficial rewarming and strenuous exercise should be avoided until tissue gas loading has reduced sufficiently that decreased solubility in rewarmed tissues will not be a problem.\n\n\n=== Risk due to loss of competence ===\nReduced core temperature are known to reduce situation awareness and analytical skills, both necessary for recognising the development of an unsafe situation and for timely correction or mitigation.\nCold exposure generally causes impairment of cognitive processes in healthy subjects at core temperatures above technical hypothermia. An exposure to cold may impair attention, speed of processing, memory and executive function, although the effects can depend to some extent on individual physiology and details of the specific exposure. Acclimatisation  and repeated exposure can affect results. Delirium may occur in mild hypothermia with a core temperature of 32–35 °C (90–95 °F) The sensation of discomfort from cold may encourage poor judgement in a decision to not extend decompression time when the decompression risk has been increased by vasoconstriction.\nPhysical strength and dexterity are known to be reduced when the muscles are chilled. Even when core temperature and acceptable general body comfort is maintained in cold water, chilling of the extremities may result in loss of strength and dexterity in the affected parts. This cane compromise the ability of the diver to operate essential equipment in an emergency.\n\n\n=== Risk associated with specific thermal management equipment ===\nThere is a greater risk of decompression sickness associated with the use of hot water suits in comparison with dry suits using only passive insulation. This is explained by the hypothesis that more inert gas is dissolved in the tissues during the bottom sector of the dive while the diver is working relatively hard as a consequence of higher perfusion due to exertion, and less vasoconstriction, due to the sensation of skin warmth from the external heating. Symptoms were predominantly skin bends. Similar effects can be expected with other active external heating systems (electric, chemical, latent heat), but core heating by heated breathing gas is not known to have this effect, and the effects on decompression risk of hot food and drinks after diving are thought to be negligible.\n\n\n== Long term effects of cold water exposure ==\nPersistent exposure of the external auditory canal to cold water can induce the growth of exostoses.\nPermanent effects of non-freezing cold injury can arise from exposure of hands to cold water. The damage depends on temperature and length of exposure.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWhite, M., Allan, D., Light, I., & Norman, J. N. (1980). Thermal balance in divers.

        "content": "Julia Rausing (11 February 1961 – 18 April 2024) was a British philanthropist. She co-founded the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust with her husband in 2014, which became one of the largest philanthropic funds in the UK.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJulia Helen Delves Broughton was born in 1961 to Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton and Helen Delves Broughton (née Shore). She had an older sister, Isabella Blow, a younger brother, John, and a younger sister, Lavinia. Julia and her sisters grew up at Doddington Hall in Cheshire and studied at Heathfield School.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBroughton, like her sisters, was left £5000 by her father on his death. The majority of his wealth was left to his third wife. Broughton worked as a personal assistant and then as a secretary at Christie's. She became a senior director there.\nBroughton met Hans Rausing in the early 2000s at Christie's. She supported him after the death of his first wife and psychiatric hospitalisation, and they married at Woburn Abbey in July 2014.\n\n\n== Philanthropic work ==\nRausing co-founded the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust with her husband in 2014 to support charities in the UK. The Trust became one of the largest charitable grant-makers in the country.\nIn 2019, the Rausings donated the largest donation that English Heritage had received at that point, to fund a new bridge to Tintagel Castle.\nRausing led an initiative, the Charity Survival Fund, during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide £35 million to charities struggling to raise funds during lockdowns. This was the single biggest donation to NHS Charities Together.\nIn 2023, the Trust identified hospices at critically low funding levels and provided £8.7million to 27 at financial risk.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nRausing died on 18 April 2024, at the age of 63, after an extended period of living with cancer.\nThe National Gallery has a room named for Rausing and her spouse, the Julia and Hans Rausing Room (Room 32). A former Moravian Church in Malmesbury was renamed the Julia and Hans Rausing Building in 2018, with funding to support its use for education, heritage, culture and the arts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia williamsiorum is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south-west of Western Australia. It is a low, compact shrub with decussate, narrowly egg-shaped leaves, and deep purple, tube-shaped flowers with hairy lobes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia williamsiorum is a low, compact shrub that typically grows up to 30 cm (12 in) high and 40 cm (16 in) side, its young branchlets hairy. The leaves are decussate, pressed against the stems, narrowly egg-shaped, 3.0–7.0 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long and 0.5–1.8 mm (0.020–0.071 in) wide. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils with elliptic to egg-shaped bracts 0.3–0.5 mm (0.012–0.020 in) long and bracteoles 1.0–1.4 mm (0.039–0.055 in) long at the base. The sepals are narrowly egg-shaped, 1.7–2.4 mm (0.067–0.094 in) long. The petals are deep purple, joined at the base, forming a tube 3.3–5.8 mm (0.13–0.23 in) long with the lobes curved back, 1.3–2.2 mm (0.051–0.087 in) long and densely hairy on the inside. Flowering occurs between mid-October and mid-December and the fruit is narrowly elliptic, 2.0–2.2 mm (0.079–0.087 in) long and 0.5–0.6 mm (0.020–0.024 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nStyphelia williamsiorum was first formally described in 2017 by Michael Clyde Hislop and Caroline Puente-Lelièvre in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (williamsiorum) honours Don and Joy Williams of Badgingarra.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species occurs in the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion of south-western Western Australia from south of Eneabba to Badgingarra and as far east as the Alexander Morrison National Park, where it grows in shallow sandy soil in low heath.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia williamsiorum is listed as \"Priority Three\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Lidcombe & Bankstown Line (numbered T6, coloured brown) is a yet-to-commence suburban railway line run on the Sydney Trains network in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was announced on 30 April 2024, a few months prior to the closure of the line previously known as the T3 Bankstown Line to be converted into rapid transit. As of April 2024, services have yet to commence on this line; it is expected that this will happen once the Bankstown Line is closed from mid-2024.\nThe line runs on the Bankstown railway line between Bankstown and Birrong and on the Main South railway line between Birrong and Lidcombe.\n\n\n== Route ==\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe Lidcombe & Bankstown Line was created as a direct result of the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project with the section of the existing Bankstown Line east of Bankstown being converted into rapid transit. In 2020, the NSW Government released a report for options for the stations west of Bankstown. Among the three options included, one included two shuttle services between Bankstown to Lidcombe and Liverpool; the second included a shuttle between Lidcombe and Bankstown, with stations north and west (and including) of Sefton to receive direct trains to the City Circle; the third included a shuttle between Bankstown and Liverpool, with direct trains to the City Circle via Regents Park from Bankstown. The second option was ultimately favoured to minimise the impact on the rest of the network.\nHowever, as a result of this, Birrong and Yagoona will lose their direct access to trains to Sydney CBD, a point which has particularly concerned advocacy groups against the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project, including Restore Inner West Line and Save T3 Bankstown Line, with the former proposing lower fares at Birrong, Yagoona and Olympic Park.\nIt is also noted the NSW Future Transport Strategy 2056 does not include Lidcombe & Bankstown Line, but instead proposes a new Parramatta to Kogarah line including a new corridor between Chester Hill and Bankstown bypassing Birrong and Yagoona station.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==",

He settled in Griekwastad, where he, along with Barend Barends was the paramount leader. Because of the hostile Hartenaars uprising (Hartenaarsopstand) he left Griekwastad with his followers in 1815. After the death of his father in 1820, Kok was the rightful successor, but after a short period as captain of Campbell he retired in favour of his brother Cornelius Kok II to join the Bergenaars (also called Hartenaars).\nIn 1826 Kok settled in Philippolis. In 1823 Adam Kok II, Cornelius Kok II, Andries Waterboer  and Barend Barends won the Battle of Dithakong, thereby sparing the Griquas the terror of the Mfecane.  He died in 1838 while returning from a visit to Cape Town. His death leads to a succession battle between his sons, Abraham Kok and Adam Kok III,  which was won by the latter.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nE.J.

        "content": "Phlebotomy licensure in the United States is the process by which various regulatory bodies regulate the practice of phlebotomy through licensure. There are no federal phlebotomy training or certification requirements, though several states have imposed their own requirements. In 2024, four states require licensure for phlebotomy: California, Louisiana, Nevada, and Washington. \nIn 2001, California enacted phlebotomy licensure after an on-the-job trained phlebotomist was found to be re-using needles. Following California, several states including Massachusetts and Missouri attempted to introduce either licensure or training/educational requirements, but the bills died.\nPhlebotomy licensure advocates claim that the licensure would enhance the quality of personnel, while the laboratory industry opposes phlebotomy licensure as an unnecessary cost. Phlebotomy is not without risk, and more challenging patients increase the chance of complications. However, without licensure, it can be difficult to hold bad actors accountable.\nIncreasingly, a number of healthcare facilities are rolling phlebotomy duties into their patient care technician roles or other allied health roles.\nA number of FDA 510k cleared devices, such as the BD Minidraw have been introduced to enable the drawing of blood without a phlebotomist. Additionally, there are devices to help aid non-phlebotomists more readily find veins.\n\n\n== Certifications ==\nThere are several national phlebotomy certifications in the US.\n\n\n== States ==\n\n\n=== California ===\nIn 2001, California enacted phlebotomy licensure following a public health outcry about an on-the-job trained phlebotomist that re-used needles.\nCalifornia has two levels of phlebotomy licensure:\n\nCertified Phlebotomy Technician I (CPT I) - authorized to perform skin puncture and venipuncture blood collection.\nCertified Phlebotomy Technician II (CPT II) - authorized to perform skin puncture, venipuncture, and arterial puncture blood collection.\nCalifornia introduced phlebotomy licensure after an on-the-job trained phlebotomist at a Palo Alto phlebotomy draw station for SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratory (SBCL) was found to be re-using needles, sometimes after washing them with diluted hydrogen peroxide, in an effort to save supplies and run a cost-efficient lab. The phlebotomist was also accused of mislabeling blood to cover-up mistakes, of reusing the same pipette for both blood and urine samples and of rarely wearing rubber gloves while working. The laboratory conducted an internal review of its phlebotomy practices at its 800 sites across the United States and found no deficiencies. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) advised the approximately 3600 impacted patients whom had their blood drawn at the clinic to get HIV and Hepatitis testing as well as counseling.A subsequent study found a low risk of infection from the re-used needles due to the low infection prevalence in Palo Alto.\n\n\n=== Connecticut ===\nIn 2005, a bill was introduced requiring 80 hours of training and certification of phlebotomists, but was not passed.\n\n\n=== District of Columbia ===\nIn 2014, DC passed Law 20-272, Clinical Laboratory Practitioners Amendment Act of 2014 which established a registration board for phlebotomists. \n\n\n=== Illinois ===\nPhlebotomists are not licensed in Illinois but must have a high school diploma and have completed a training program to practice. Certification is not required and phlebotomists do not fall under the Illinois Clinical Laboratory Act.\nIn 2020, Illinois passed a bill requiring the Illinois Department of Public Health to triannually develop training materials for drawing blood from children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and for facilities to ensure the training is incorporated for phlebotomists.\nThere have been bills to introduce phlebotomy licensure in Illinois, but have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n=== Kentucky ===\nIn 2005, a bill was introduced that would require 80 hours of didactic and practical training, plus 50 hours of clinical training, and certification as a phlebotomy technician for phlebotomy, that did not pass.\n\n\n==== Louisiana ====\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nIn 2007, a bill (HR 312) was introduced to establish a board of registration of phlebotomists, but did not pass.\n\n\n=== Missouri ===\nIn 2008, a bill to license medical technologists and phlebotomists was introduced, but did not pass.\n\n\n==== Nevada ====\n\n\n=== North Carolina ===\nNorth Carolina does not have any additional state requirements for phlebotomy.\n\n\n==== Washington ====\n\n\n=== West Virginia ===\nIn 1999, a bill was introduced that would require phlebotomists be certified, but it died in committee.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEdwards, Mac (Oct 2005). \"Coalition strives for phlebotomy personnel standards\".

        "content": "Francesc Arín i Simó (1891–1936) was a Valencian trade unionist and journalist. A metalworker by trade, Arín became a union leader in the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), within which he formed part of the moderate faction. He led the metalworkers' union through the early 1920s, which saw him arrested, exiled and blacklisted. He then switched professions to work in the fishing industry, within which he likewise became a trade union leader. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, he joined the Solidaridad group led by Ángel Pestaña and continued to organise the CNT throughout the period.\nWhen he was elected as the Secretary General of the CNT in 1930, he began to pursue a policy of legalisation, opposing the use of conspiratorial methods against the government. After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, he argued for the temporary defence of the republic until the CNT had consolidated its strength and the threat of a reactionary coup d'état had been averted. Together with Pestaña, he published the Manifesto of the Thirty, which criticised premature calls for insurrection by individual cadres. The faction gradually lost influence within the CNT and eventually split from it entirely, forming the Federación Sindicalista Libertaria (FSL). Arín pushed for the FSL's reintegration into the CNT and rejoined the organisation by 1936. He was killed by the Nationalists in the first days of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and activism ===\nFrancesc Arín i Simó was born in the Valencian town of Benicarló, in 1891. By 1910, he had moved to Argentina, where he became involved in the anarchist movement as a contributor to the magazine La Protesta. He became known to the Argentine government as a \"dangerous foreigner\" and, on 2 March 1912, he was prosecuted for an article he co-wrote for La Protesta in which he insulted President Roque Sáenz Peña. Although he was acquitted due to a lack of merit, he was nevertheless deported on 26 March 1912 to Barcelona, where he join theed anarcho-syndicalist movement.\nA metalworker by trade, by 1918, he had become a leading trade unionist within the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), as secretary of the Barcelona Metalworkers' Union. Together with Ángel Pestaña and Salvador Seguí, he was also a leading figure in the moderate faction of the CNT.\nIn October 1920, he led a strike action by metalworkers in Barcelona, which ended in an agreement with their employers. The following month, after Severiano Martínez Anido was appointed as governor of the province of Barcelona and initiated a campaign of repression against the syndicalist movement, Arín was arrested and imprisoned on board the Giralda, in the port of Barcelona. He was subsequently deported to La Mola for his trade unionist activities, but by 1922, he had returned to mainland Spain. In July 1922, he was delegated by the metalworkers' union to the CNT's regional conference in Blanes. In January 1923, he also presided over a regional plenary of the CNT in Barceloneta.\nBy 1923, Arín had been blacklisted from jobs in the metalworking industry; he was forced to change professions, managing to find work as a foreman, unloading freshly-caught fish at the docks. From 1924 to 1925, he collaborated on the magazine Fructidor.\n\n\n=== Clandestine activities ===\nDuring the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, he joined Ángel Pestaña's group Solidaridad. After the collapse of the dictatorship, he became editor of the group's weekly magazine Acción, which published its first issue on 15 February 1930, and was tasked with reorganising the CNT after years in clandestinity. He participated in rallies in Mataró and Barcelona, organised respectively by unions in the local cinema and theatre sectors, and was also elected as president of the CNT's fishing union.\nIn June 1930, he joined the CNT's national committee, headed by Progreso Alfarache. After Alfarache's arrest in September 1930, Arín himself took over as Secretary General of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo. From this position, he acted as the CNT's official representative in meetings with republican revolutionary committees, which aimed to overthrow the Spanish monarchy, but he came out opposed to the use of any conspiratorial methods.  Instead, in January 1931, he went to La Model prison in Barcelona, where he signed a document calling for the CNT to carry out a public campaign for political freedom. He began to campaign openly for the legalisation of the CNT, even sending a delegation to meet with the prime minister Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas at the end of February. The following month, he explained his decision in an article published in Solidaridad Obrera.\n\n\n=== Treintism ===\nFollowing the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in June 1931, he participated in the CNT's extaordinary congress in Madrid, where he reaffirmed his moderate political positions. Together with Pestaña and Joan Peiró, who also served on the national committee, Arín revealed the extent of the CNT's collaboration with Catalan republican groups against the dictatorship and outlined his belief that the nascent Republic had to be temporarily supported until the CNT had consolidated itself and the threat of a reactionary coup d'état had been averted, which provoked a heated exchange between delegates. When members of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) objected to the national committee's collaborationism, Arín accused them of hypocrisy, claiming that it had been the FAI that had initiated their collaboration with republican political and military groups, without having consulted the national committee.\nOver time, Arín became increasingly critical of the FAI, which he accused of acting against the CNT. In response, Arín himself proposed to his fellow moderates that they publish a manifesto, personally signed with each of their names. In August 1931, he and 29 other moderate members of the CNT signed the Manifesto of the Thirty. Drafted by Pestaña and rewritten by Progreso Alfarache, Agustín Gibanel and Ricardo Fornells, the manifesto criticised the FAI's revolutionary aspirations as \"naive\", declaring that revolution could only be accomplished by the co-ordinated will of the working masses, not by a militant minority. Arín and his fellow treintistas were subsequently denounced by members of the FAI, including Buenaventura Durruti and Joan Garcia i Oliver, the latter of whom accused them of \"dictatorial syndicalism\". Undeterred, Arín contributed to the publication of the Solidaridad group's official weekly newspaper, Cultura Libertaria, which began publication in November 1931.\nIn March 1932, Arín and Pestaña were removed from the CNT's national committee and the treintistas increasingly lost influence within the organisation. The following month, Arín participated in the CNT's regional plenary in Sabadell, which saw the split of the treintista unions from the rest of organisation. In May 1932, he organised a meeting of the CNT's local federation in Sabadell, in which they defined their position on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932. In July 1932, he was expelled from the CNT's transport union, which he had presided over for a year; that same month, he also established the Barcelona Fishing Industry Union along treintista lines, for which he served as president until February 1932.\nArín was a founding member of the treintista organisation, the Federación Sindicalista Libertaria (FSL). He was elected to preside over its first meeting, set to be held on 9 April 1933, but it wasn't able to go ahead because of the CNT's opposition to it. When Pestaña left the FSL in 1934, Arín took over as the organisation's vice-secretary, a position from which he oversaw its reintegration into the CNT. The following year, he began collaborating on the magazine Sindicalismo. In February 1936, he co-organised a rally in Mataró with Joan Peiró; and in June 1936, a rally in Balsareny with Antonio Ortiz Ramírez.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was in the middle of a propaganda tour; he found himself in the province of Seville when it was captured by Nationalists during their coup d'état. On 18 July 1936, after a meeting in Carmona, he was arrested and shot by the forces of Gonzalo Queipo de Llano.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Music For One Apartment And Six Drummers is an art movie, a found music video, and a conceptual short film released in 2001 by Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson It depicts a group of musicians performing their piece in a vacant apartment using various day-to-day objects to create the music.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFour men and a woman are sitting in a car with one man leaning against the car outside. One of the men is briefly looking at a map. When the time is right, after an old couple, seemingly on their way out to walk the dog, can be seen leaving the apartment complex in the background, the crew leaves the car heading for the apartment building.\nThe crew proceeds to an apartment lockpicking their way into it and moves to each room of the apartment playing music on objects found in each room. The whole procedure is timed to the clock by a wristwatch wore by one of the musicians. The old couple then gets back from their walk while the musicians are still in the apartment.\n\n\n== Instruments ==\nThe music starts lowkey in the kitchen with the musicians seemingly focused on the task at hand with no excessive instruments used. The music is then intensified, going into the bedroom and bathroom, and then culminates when in the living room which shows on the musicians faces and in their gestures. This can also be seen in the mood the music is made in - from the stringent use of kitchen utensils to the overblown mess in the living room using books thrown on the floor from the shelf as instrument. This is done to the extent that the musicians seemingly looses control of time as they have just stopped performing, with no time to exit, when the old pair gets back to the apartment.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\nThe piece might be inspired by John Cage's 4'33'' in a maximalistic twist i.e. an inverted silence is brought about in an empty apartment that is being overrun by impromptu instruments.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMusic For One Apartment And Six Drummers won the 2001 Guldbagge Award for best short film.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Vandal War (461–468) was a long-term conflict between the two halves of the Roman Empire on the one hand and the Vandals in North Africa on the other. This war revolved around hegemony in the Mediterranean and the empire of the west. The Vandals as a rising power posed an enormous threat to the stability of the Roman Empire. Piracy and plunder were a scourge, threatening trade throughout the Mediterranean. The Roman war effort from 466 onwards was aimed at the destruction of the Vandal Kingdom in order to restore the empire to its original territory. Armed conflicts alternated with peace talks and the two parts of the Roman Empire did not always act in unison.\n\n\n== Main figures ==\nGeiseric (429–477), king of the Vandals, had played an important role since he led his people to Africa in 429. He had received that position by emerging victorious in a series of wars with the Romans. In the conflict between 461 and 468 his main opponents were: Ricimer, commander-in-chief of the Western Roman army and strongman in the west since his coup in 461, and Leo I (457–474), emperor of the eastern part of the Roman Empire, who frequently occupied himself with the western part due to the lack of a western counterpart. The eastern emperor oversaw many ambitious political and military plans, mainly aimed at aiding the faltering Western Roman Empire and recovering its former territories.\nFurthermore, the Roman general Marcellinus, a fierce opponent of Recimer, played a prominent role from the start. The role of Western Roman emperor Libius Severus (461–465) was minimal, while that of his successor Anthemius (467-472), on the other hand, was considerably greater. Basiliscus at least, an Eastern Roman general, played a important role at the end of the war.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nAfter the earlier Vandal War of 439–442, North Africa largely fell into the hands of the Vandals. Formally as foederati of the Romans, but de facto they ruled this part of the empire to their own discretion. Since then, the Vandals had control of part of the Mediterranean fleet and focused on piracy, at first on a small scale but becoming more and more significant over time. The Western Roman Empire lacked sufficient resources to effectively counter this.\n\n\n=== Sack of Rome ===\n\nIn 455, the Vandal king Geiseric saw the usurpation of Maximus as an open violation of his treaty with the Romans, and an opportunity to invade Rome with his fleet. The city was plundered for two weeks (Sack of Rome).\nAccording to Johannes Malalas, who wrote a chronicle a century later, Geiseric was summoned by Eudoxia, the wife of the murdered emperor Valentinian III to avenge the murder of her husband. He captured Eudoxia and her two daughters, Eudocia and Placidia, when they tried to flee.\n\n\n=== Destruction of the Roman fleet ===\nIn 460, the Roman army under the then emperor Majorian campaigned in Spain to strengthen Roman authority. While his generals defeated the Suebi in Lusitania (modern Santarém, Portugal), preparations were made for a campaign against the Vandals. The emperor assembled a large force with which he set out from Gaul to Carthaginensis, where his fleet was moored at Portus Illicitanus (near Elche). Geiseric, fearing the Roman invasion, tried to make peace with Majorian, who rejected this. Geiseric then used other means. Traitors paid by the Vandals set fire to the fleet on 13 May 460. Even before the army arrived, the fleet was destroyed. Majorian canceled the attack on the Vandals and had to disband the large army he had raised. In Arles he received messengers from Geiseric, with whom he agreed to make peace, which was probably a confirmation of the peace of 442. For Majorian, the failed campaign against the Vandals was a huge setback which put an end to his plans to restore the empire to its former glory, and it also undermined his position as emperor of the west.\n\n\n=== Ricimer's coup ===\nIn August 461, Majorian returned to Italy, where he was imprisoned by Ricimer, the commander-in-chief of the Roman army, and then murdered on August 7. Ricimer's coup plunged the Western Roman Empire into a huge crisis. In Gaul, the Burgundian and Gothic foederati, who had gained a high degree of independence in exchange for supporting Majorian, turned away from Roman authority, while Ricimer received little support from the Roman army outside  Italy. The generals Aegidius in Gaul, Nepotianus in Spain and Marcellinus in Sicily resisted and refused to follow orders from Italy.  The Gallic army seems to have declared Aeidius counter-emperor and in Sicily Marcellinus had ambitions in that direction.\n\n\n== Start ==\n\n\n=== Vandal occupation of the Western Isles ===\nAn interregnum of three months followed, during which the title of Western Emperor was not claimed. During this interregnum there was a political struggle for succession between Ricimer, the Eastern emperor Leo I, and Geiseric. Finally, Libius Severus (461-465) was put forward as emperor by Ricimer and inaugurated by the Senate in Ravenna on 19 November 461. This appointment was not recognized by the eastern part and for the Vandals this was a valid reason to break the peace treaty with the Romans. A new war with the Vandals broke out and at the end of 461, Geiseriks' naval fleet captured the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Malta and the Balearic Islands from the Romans and raided mainland Italy and Greece.\nRicimer, now the strongman in the west, was indeed lord and master in Italy, but in addition to the hostile attacks in the Mediterranean region, he had to deal with open military opposition from the generals Aegidius, Nepotianus and Marcellinus. In Marcellinus, who stayed south of Italy in Sicily, Ricimer saw a danger to his position. Ricimer turned to a ruse to get this able general out of his way. Marcellin's army consisted mainly of Hun auxiliary troops. Bribes from Ricimer induced the Huns to abandon Marcellin's service and enter his. Deprived of most of his troops, Marcellinus left for Dalmatia. However, Ricimer did not intervene militarily, because Marcellinus was supported by the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I. Nepotianus and Aetius no longer posed a danger to Ricimer after he managed to attract the Gothic and Burgundian foederati to him with generous favors.\n\n\n=== Peace negotiations ===\nAfter Marcellin's departure, Sicily was again ravaged by Vandal attacks, but Ricimer's negotiations had no effect. A peace mission under the umbrella of the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo in 462 was more successful. The ladies of the Theodosian house returned from their captivity. Eudocia, the bride of Huneric, was saved, but her mother Eudoxia and her sister Placidia were sent to Constantinople. In return, Geiseric negotiated for a certain portion of Valentinian III's property as the treasure of Eudocia. He had already occupied and annexed the Mauritanian provinces, as well as Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands, and planned to preserve the marriage of his son Huneric to Eudocia.\n\n\n=== Vandal claim to the emperor ===\nGeiserics' concession had a clear political purpose. The Vandal monarch now emerged as the champion of the Theodosian house against Ricimer and his upstart emperor. Placidia was married to Olybrius, a member of a prominent Roman family, and Geiseric demanded that Olybrius succeed to the throne in Italy. Threatened on the one hand by the Vandals, on the other by Marcellinus in Dalmatia, Ricimer and the obedient Senate asked for mediation from the Eastern Roman emperor. Leo was asked to bring about a reconciliation with Geiseric and Marcellinus. Leo agreed, after which Marcellinus ceased hostilities. However, the envoys that Leo sent to Geiseric returned from Carthage without results. Geiseric claimed on behalf of his daughter-in-law that all her father's private property in Italy belonged to him, as well as the inheritance of Aetius, whose son Gaudentius he kept as a prisoner. In pursuit of these claims, Geiseric led a major expedition against Italy and Sicily, destroying rural districts and undefended towns. Ricimer had little to say against this, his army and navy failed to stop the Vandals at sea.\n\n\n=== Ricimers' campaign against Aegidius ===\nIn 463 a confusing spectacle occurred,\nwhen Ricimer, in the name of the western emperor Libius Serverus, employed Goths to attack part of the Roman army in Gaul. When the battle was fought at Orleans, Aegidius was victorious. His rebellion was not curtailed until the autumn of 465, when he was murdered. At the time, Aegidius was engaged in negotiations with the Vandal king Geiseric, attempting to build an alternative balance of western forces to challenge Ricimer's dominance.\n\n\n=== Battle for Sicily and Interregnum ===\nIn 464 or 465 Marcellinus again campaigned against the Vandals. By order of Emperor Leo I, he returned to Sicily to defend the island against the Vandals which posed a direct threat to the personal power and prestige of Ricimer, who called on Leo to persuade Marcellinus not to undertake hostilities against him.\nEmperor Libius Severus, who was no more than a puppet of Ricimer, died on 15 August 465. His cause of death is unknown: both murder and natural causes are possible. The elevation of Olybrius, which would have been a restitution of the Theodosian dynasty, may have seemed a hopeful solution to some of the difficulties of the situation, but the fact that he was Geiseriks' candidate and relative was a reason not to accept him. A year and eight months after the death of Libius Severus, no successor was appointed.\n\n\n== Continuation of the war ==\n\n\n=== Invasion of the Peloponnesus ===\nIn 467, the sea attacks by the Vandals became increasingly extensive. Geiseric's warships now also appeared off the coast of the Peloponnesus and Egypt. It was feared that there would be an attack on Alexandria that would have consequences for the grain supply of the Eastern Roman capital. This threat explains why the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo I decided to no longer stand idly by. He abandoned the diplomatic path and took steps to achieve closer cooperation with the Western Roman government in Italy. \nNow that not only Italy and Sicily were threatened but the trade of the entire Mediterranean, the forces of the East had to be united with those of Italy and Dalmatia against the African enemy. Leo agreed with Ricimir that Anthemius, general in the eastern army, would become the new emperor of the west. Ricimer's support was secured by an arrangement for him to marry Anthemius' daughter.\nIn the spring of 467, Anthemius, accompanied by Marcellinus, arrived with an army to Italy. After his accession to the throne on 12 April 467, a large-scale campaign against the Vandals was prepared, to be undertaken by an Eastern Roman fleet with land troops under the overall command of Emperor Leo's brother-in-law, Basiliscus. Anthemius appointed Marcellinus, also to counterbalance Ricimer, as second imperial general and commander-in-chief of the Western Roman troops involved in the campaign.\n\n\n=== Plan of Attack ===\n\nThe attack plan that the Romans had in mind was based on the idea of having the eastern and western armies act together and attack the Vandals simultaneously on three fronts. The eastern army had to be divided into two for this. A sizable fleet was assembled, reputedly consisting of 1,113 ships, to carry an army of 100,000 men. Marcellinus, was ordered to conquer Sardinia and then sail to the coast of North Africa to link up with the eastern fleet under Basiliscus.. Basiliscus would then sail directly to Carthage with the joint fleet. Heraclius, another general, would gather eastern forces in Egypt, disembark at Tripolitania, and then attack by land at Carthage. Procopius estimated the cost of the expedition at 130,000 pounds of gold; Ioannes Laurentius Lydus estimated the cost at 65,000 pounds of gold and 750,000 pounds of silver.\n\n\n=== The attack of the Romans ===\nMarcellinus recaptured Sardinia with little difficulty, and Heraclius met little resistance from the Vandals in Tripolitania, and both moved to make contact with Basiliscus's forces. According to Procopius, Basiliscus' fleet dispersed the Vandal fleet near Sicily, but Basiliscus did not take advantage of this advantage and rested his troops at Cape Bon, a strategic location sixty kilometers away from Carthage. According to historians Michael Kulikowski, Friell and Williams, Geiseric appealed for peace and proposed a five-day armistice to give themselves time to prepare in the meantime. Heather notes that the Romans favored avoiding a naval battle, and that this may have been the reason Basiliscus hesitated to take on the Vandals to attack.\n\n\n=== The Defense of the Vandals ===\n\nIn the days allotted to him, Geiserik assembled a new fleet with a number of fireships and, aided by good winds, attacked the Roman fleet. The Roman fleet was defeated by the combination of the fireships, bad winds and surprise, with half of it destroyed. Basiliscus fled with the rest of the fleet to Sicily, to consolidate with Marcellin's forces; their morale and supplies might have secured a victory, but Marcellinus was murdered, possibly by order of Ricimer. Heraclius, who had not yet reached Carthage, returned to the Eastern Roman Empire by retracing the path he had taken, and Basiliscus returned to Constantinople with half his fleet.\n\n\n== Aftermath and consequences ==\nThe poor result that the Romans achieved with the large-scale operation at the end of the Vandal war must have had a major morale effect. The Roman Empire had brought all its strength to bear and had failed in its mission to destroy the Vandal Empire. According to Heather the battle considered to have ended the Western Roman Empire's chances of survival. Without access to the resources of the former Roman province of Africa, the west could not sustain an army powerful enough to defeat its numerous enemies.\nNevertheless, it took two years for Geiserik to regain enough confidence to resume his attacks on Italy.\nIn 472, Ricimer's western regime came to terms with Geiseric, making his son's brother-in-law, Olybrius, emperor. Geiseric did not make peace with the Eastern Roman Empire until 476. He concluded a treaty with the new emperor Zeno entitled Eternal Peace. This treaty was fairly faithfully observed on both sides under his successors. A revolution in Carthage in 531 finally gave the Roman Empire, which then only existed in the East, the desired opportunity for intervention, leading to the Vandal War (533–534).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nPeter Heather (2008), The Fall of the Western Empire 425-76, pag. 5 t/m 32, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS\nKulikowski, Michael (2019).

He was also successful judoka. He was posthumously awarded the Golden Police Star, the Medal for Bravery, and the Order of the Golden Crest with Swords, after he died in the Battle of Hrasno, during the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian War.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVinko Šamarlić was born on March 8, 1964, in Ozimica near Žepče. After finishing elementary school in Zavidovići, he went to Sarajevo, where he attended the Police High School. After finishing school, he was first employed as a policeman, and in 1985 he joined the Special Unit, where he became the commander of a combat unit with the rank of captain. In parallel with this, he was a prominent judoka of the Sarajevo Judo Club Željezničar. He won numerous medals and became a member of the Bosnian national team.\nAt the onset of the Bosnian War, he had met the Olympic qualification standard to compete in the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. As a member of the special unit of the Ministry of the Internal Affairs of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he died in the battle of Hrasno on June 8, 1992, the day before the departure of the team to the Olympic Games in Barcelona, where he was supposed to carry the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n== Orders and medals ==\nHe was posthumously awarded the \"Golden Police Star\", the \"Medal for Bravery\" and the \"Order of the Golden Crest with Swords\". In his memory, a street in Ilidža near Sarajevo bears his name, and every year in his memory the international Vinko Šamarlić Memorial Judo Tournament is held in Sarajevo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3758 known as the Owl Galaxy, is a type Sb spiral galaxy in the constellation of Leo. It is located 447 million light-years from the solar system and an approximate diameter of 70,000 light-years. NGC 3758 was discovered by Ralph Copeland on March 18, 1874, but also independently discovered by Edouard Stephan ten years later.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nNGC 3758 is classified as a Seyfert 1 type galaxy. It is classified a Markarian galaxy (designated Mrk 739), because compared to other galaxies its nucleus emits excessive amounts of ultraviolet rays.  It is a binary active galactic nucleus galaxy, a rare example of a galaxy merger.  \n\nNGC 3758 is made up of two separate galaxies, NGC 3758W and NGC 3758E. Each of the two galaxies has a supermassive black hole, which is only 11,000 light-years apart and gorging on infalling gas. Both black holes are active, in which large amounts of gas is sent spiraling inward, which it becomes hot and radiates energy. The galaxies are gravitationally bound together and such, their orbits will dynamically decay until their nuclei merge in which the process takes a few billion years.\nThe galaxy has an appearance of a friendly-looking object complete with two cores as the eyes and a swirling grin. It is possible that binary black holes on the verge of merging in NGC 3758 can turn stars into hypervelocity stars and catapult them out of their host galaxy.\nNGC 3758 contains an extended emission-line region (EELR), which was discovered in the Galaxy Zoo project. This EELR could originate from both AGN or from just one. Detailed oxygen [O III] imaging could reveal which AGN is responsible for this EELR. ESO's VLT MUSE instrument is capable of such observations and MUSE did observe NGC 3758 in 2016, but no publication about the MUSE data concerning the EELR exists as of May 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Tauranga mayoral election is to be held to elect the Mayor of Tauranga. It is the first election since the Minister of Local Government appointed a Crown Commission on 9 February 2021 to oversee all of Tauranga City Council's governance responsibilities.\nThe election will be held using a Single Transferable Vote system.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe last mayor, Tenby Powell, was elected to the office in October 2019 but resigned in November 2020, eight months after he was unanimously censured by his council for an angry outburst. Following further mayoral \"outbursts,\" Powell publicly called for the Minister of Local Government to appoint a commission to replace the \"dysfunctional\" council. The decision to cancel the election for a new mayor and councillors, and the appointment of a crown commission instead by Local Government minister Nanaia Mahuta was not without controversy. A legal opinion by law firm Russell McVeagh found her decision may have been \"unlawful\" and Tauranga MP Simon Bridges called the decision \"dramatic and draconian\", while saying that Powell quitting removed \"a significant source of friction\" and it was reasonable to assume the council would become more functional with the election of a new Mayor and Councillors.\nThe 2022 local elections were cancelled by the government and the commission remained in place until an election for members of the Tauranga City Council to be held on 20 July 2024. Additionally, the Minister also decided to postpone the 2025 local election in Tauranga until 2028. The council elected in 2024 will thus serve a four year term, a first for New Zealand.\n\n\n== Key dates ==\nKey dates for the election are:\n\n19 April: Last day to switch electoral roll.\n26 April: Nominations opened for candidates.\n24 May: Nominations close.\n29 June–3 July: Voting papers delivered.\n29 June: Special voting begins.\n20 July: Polling day. Voting documents needed to be at council before voting closes at 12 noon. Preliminary results available as soon as all ordinary votes are counted.\n23–25 July: Official results, including all valid ordinary and special votes, declared.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nRia Hall, musician and television presenter\nTina Salisbury, deputy mayor 2020-21\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Tauranga local elections\n\n\n== References ==",

The club's aim was to look for young British talent to strengthen their team, and to offer a professional contract to one. Eventually, Foster was invited to Finland and offered a one-year professional contract with a one-year option. SalPa documented the sessions and later published a mini-documentary series, Unelma elää (eng. The Dream is Alive), about the recruiting process.\nOn 28 April 2024, in his fourth Ykkösliiga match with SalPa, Foster scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 home win over MP.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKeir Foster at Soccerway",

        "content": "Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad: A Family Memoir of Miraculous Survival is a memoir by Daniel Finkelstein. It was first published in June 2023 in the United Kingdom by William Collins, and as Two Roads Home: Hitler, Stalin, and the Miraculous Survival of My Family by Doubleday in the United States in September 2023. It is an account of his Jewish parents' persecution during World War II, and how his mother survived Hitler's death camps, and his father endured slave labour and starvation in Stalin's Siberian Gulag.\nFinkelstein is a British journalist and politician. He is a political columnist and former executive editor of The Times in London, and was a member of the House of Lords in August 2013.\nHitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad was the 2023 winner of the British literary magazine, Slightly Foxed's \"Best First Biography Prize\", and a finalist in the 2023 National Jewish Book Awards. The memoir was selected by several publications as one of their best books of 2023, including the Financial Times, The Spectator, and The Economist.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nHitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad tells the story of Daniel Finkelstein's family in Europe, before, during, and after World War II.\nMirjam, Daniel's mother, the youngest daughter of German Jews, Margarete (Grete) and Alfred Wiener, was born in Berlin in 1933. Alfred made it his life's ambition to document the raise of antisemitism in Germany and record Nazi crimes. When Hitler came to power in 1933, and it became clear that Jews were no longer safe in Germany, Alfred relocated his family to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, close to where Anne Frank lived. At the time, the Netherlands was considered a safe haven because of its neutrality. Alfred took his library of accumulated documents to London for safety and was preparing to bring Grete and their three daughters to England, when Germany invaded the Netherlands, cutting Alfred off from his family. In June 1943, Grete and her three daughters, including ten-year-old Mirjam, were detained by the Nazis and sent to the Westerbork transit camp in northeastern Netherlands. From there they were transported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany in January 1944, where they were forced to work as slaves and given very little food.\nLudwik Finkelstein, Daniel's father, was the son of Adolf (Dolu) and Amalia Finkelstein (Lusia), prosperous Polish Jews living in Lwów in eastern Poland (now Lviv in western Ukraine). In August 1939, Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact in which they agreed to divide Poland between them, and in September 1939, Germany invaded west Poland and the Soviet Union east Poland. Overnight, the Finkelsteins became Soviet citizens, but were soon detained on suspicion of being anti-Soviet. Dolu was deported to a Siberian Gulag slave labour camp in Ukhta near the Arctic Circle, while Lusia and ten-year-old Ludwik were sent to a forced labour collective farm in Kazakhstan. The Finkelsteins had to constantly fight freezing temperatures and starvation to stay alive.\nIn June 1941, Hitler launched an offensive against Stalin which resulted in the release of Dolu, Lusia and Ludwik from the Soviets. Dolu, now recruited with many other released Poles to fight the advancing Germans, reunited with Lusia and Ludwik in Yangiyoʻl in Uzbekistan in March 1942. The Finkelsteins made their slow way out of the Soviet Union to Tehran in Iran in August 1942, and then onto London in August 1947.\nIn London in 1944, Alfred managed to secure fake Paraguayan passports for Grete and their daughters, and in January 1945, they were released from Bergen-Belsen as part of a prisoner exchange with the Germans. Grete died later that month, but Mirjam and her sisters travelled to Switzerland and then onto New York City in February 1945. They joined Alfred later in London in January 1947. Mirjam met Ludwik in April 1956, and they married in July 1957.\nDaniel Finkelstein, the second of three children, was born to Mirjam and Ludwik in London in August 1962. Daniel's paternal grandparents, Dolu and Lusia died in June 1950 and February 1980 respectively, while his maternal grandfather, Alfred died in February 1964. Daniel's parents, Mirjam and Ludwik died in January 2017 and August 2011 respectively. British intelligence made extensive use of Alfred's library during the war, and it was used as evidence during the Nuremberg trials in 1945–1946. After the war, his library was formally established as the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, and became one of the world's foremost Holocaust research institutes.\n\n\"In the battle with Hitler and Stalin, the victory belongs to Mum and Dad.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review in The Guardian, Rohan Silva called Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad a \"powerful and beautifully written … book\". He said Finkelstein explores themes that lift the memoir \"to the status of a modern classic\", alongside Philippe Sands's East West Street and Edmund de Waal's The Hare with Amber Eyes. Silva stated that one such theme is \"the futility of intellectual reasoning in the face of rabid irrationality.\" He noted that despite Alfred Wiener's dedication to \"expos[ing] the contradictions of antisemite[ism]\", the Nazis still took over the country. Another theme in the book is despair. Even though Finkelstein's parents survived, Sliva remarked that \"there’s an overwhelming sense of what has been lost: so many families, so many happy homes, so many childhoods.\"\nWriting in The Daily Telegraph, Angus Reilly described Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad as a \"superb memoir\". He said \"powered by a sense of filial duty\", Finkelstein has produced \"an exciting story of courage and persistence\" that is \"engagingly sustained\" from start to finish. Reilly opined that just as Philippe Sands and Jonathan Freedland have returned to the Holocaust to write books \"full of emotive colour\", Finkelstein has done the same, delivering \"an elegy for the past, and a hopeful call for the future.\" Reilly gave the book a rating of five stars out of five.\nIan Hughes called Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad a \"heartbreaking family testimony\" that is \"deeply moving\". In a review in The Irish Times Hughes said he found parts of the book almost \"unbearable to read\", including the accounts of how most of the children who played together in the streets of Amsterdam in the early 1940s ended up being killed in Nazi death camps. Hughes stated that Finkelstein's \"remarkable book\" is \"an extraordinary testimony to love and hate\", and \"is essential reading for our troubled present\".\nIn a review of Two Roads Home (the United States edition of the book) in The Wall Street Journal, Tunku Varadarajan stated that Finkelstein's story is \"so overflowing with cruelty and loss that [his] prose needs only to be spare and plain for us to be scorched by his narrative\". Varadarajan wrote that Finkelstein \"is firm in his own conviction that [Hitler and Stalin] were peers in the annals of evil\", and added that it came as \"no greater blessing\" to the author that by surviving, his mother and father had beaten both dictators.\nDiane Cole called the memoir \"an indelible chronicle of both historical and personal significance.\" Reviewing Two Roads Home in The Washington Post, Cole said it \"tracks each family member’s physical passage through the inferno alongside the soul-scarring cycles of doubt and despair\". She found that she had to stop reading from time to time to process \"the cruelties so routinely perpetrated by both Hitler’s and Stalin’s forces\", but stated that it was Finkelstein's \"adroit depiction[s]\" of the book's characters and their resilience that kept her reading this \"unflinching and gripping family history\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nFinkelstein, Daniel (2023).

        "content": "Bamburgh Castle Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Bamburgh in the county of Northumberland. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1882. \nThe station was closed in 1897.\n\n\n== History ==\nA local coble was modified to act as a lifeboat for Bamburgh Castle by Lionel Lukin in 1786. This was done at the request of a Dr Sharp and supported by the \"Crewe Trustees\", a charitable organisation founded by Nathaniel Crewe, Bishop of Durham in 1704. Because of this, it was long thought that Bamburgh Castle was the first lifeboat station in the country but more recent research puts that distinction with Formby Lifeboat Station, founded 10 years earlier.\nIt was only in 1882, following several shipwrecks in the area, that requests were made to the RNLI to place a boat at Bamburgh, which was agreed. A site for a boathouse was chosen on The Wyndings, and constructed at a cost of £231. A 32-foot self-righting \"pulling and sailing\"\" lifeboat (one with oars and sails), built by Woolfe of Shadwell and costing £282, was funded by the late Mr John Cuttell, of Holmfirth, Yorkshire, and named after the donor and his sister John and Betty Cuttell (ON 184) at a ceremony on 24 August 1882. A further £1000 was donated by Miss Cuttell for the upkeep of the Bamburgh Castle lifeboat in perpetuity. Two further lifeboats to serve at Banburgh were also named John and Betty Cuttell.\nIn 1885, the John and Betty Cuttell (ON 184) was transferred to Upgang lifeboat station near Whitby, renamed Joseph Sykes, and Bamburgh received another 32-foot self-righting lifeboat built by Woolfe, a slightly older boat built in 1879, previously named City of Manchester at Ferryside Lifeboat Station.\nShe was called out twice over the next 4 years, both calls in March 1888, firstly to the Marshall of Thurso on 4 March 1888, the crew being rescued by the Boulmer lifeboat.\nThe second call-out, on 15 March 1888, resulted in an inquiry being held after the crew failed to launch to the Albion of Brevig, which was wrecked with the loss of 7 of 10 crew, 3 reaching shore themselves. This inquiry, held by the RNLI's district inspector at the Victoria Hotel in Bamburgh, pointed to the reasons for the lifeboat stations closure several years later. The crew were acquitted of wasting inordinate time before launching, and then for failing to man the lifeboat. In defence it was said that the location was extremely difficult to launch from, with both men and the wheeled lifeboat carriage getting stuck in the flat sand. Also it was noted that the location had caused a difficulty in recruiting crew, with the local men tending to relocate frequently for work, the crew was instead situated in North Sunderland and conveyed to Bamburgh upon the alarm being raised.\nA third and final lifeboat would be provided to Bamburgh in 1889. This time, it was a 34-foot self-righting lifeboat, again constructed by Woolfe, costing £426, and again named John and Betty Cuttell (ON 247). The boat was only launched once, along with the North Sunderland lifeboat Thomas Berwick, on 4 April 1891, to the Ornen, aground at Greehill Rocks. Both lifeboats were beaten by the conditions, and failed to reach the vessel. The following day, with calmer conditions, a rescue was carried out by the North Sunderland lifeboat. The John and Betty Cuttell was called, but stood down, a further three times.\nWith a record of just three launches and no lives saved over a 15 year period, primarily due to difficult launching conditions, the Bamburgh Castle lifeboat station was closed in 1897. The boathouse still remains, and is used as a Holiday Let.\nIn 2021, car mechanic Chris Mason set off on his own personal challenge to visit every lifeboat station in the UK and Ireland, raising money for the RNLI on the way. He started his trip at the former station at Bamburgh Castle.\n\n\n== Bamburgh Castle lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He worked as a liquor manufacturer in Saint John, New Brunswick, serving in a firm for manufacturing agents as its president.\nIn early June of 1969, Loomer was elected mayor of Saint John, defeating the preceded Joseph A. Macdougall in the municipal election. He was sworn into office on June 22, 1969. As mayor, he was featured in an article about Saint John's urban renewal project by The New York Times, where he shared an optimistic view on the future of Saint John and its port, being \"confident that [Saint John] is in an idea position to attract container shipments.\" His term in office was short-lived, serving as mayor for only 26 days until his death.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn September 27, 1941, Loomer became married to Irene Stevens Curie. At the time, he lived in Saint John. They had one son, who died in 2022. On July 18, 1969, Loomer died at a hospital in Toronto, Ontario from a heart attack, two days after being admitted there for a physical examination. Following his death, his office was taken over by then-deputy mayor Arthur L. Gould, until James E. Calvin was elected on October 6, 1969.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hie Site (比恵遺跡, Hie iseki) is a complex archeological site entered on the remains of a group of raised-floor warehouses built in the late Kofun period (6th to 7th century), located in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.  It was designated as a National Historic Site in 2001.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Hie Site is thought to be the remains of the \"Natsu no Miyake\" mentioned in the Nihon Shoki in an entry dated 536. The site itself is extensive, and contains traces dating from the Japanese Paleolithic period to the Sengoku period. It is located in the center of the Fukuoka Plain, on a diluvial plateau with an elevation of five to seven meters between the Naka River and the Mikasa River. Although the administrative site name is different from the Naka ruins group adjacent to the southeast, they are one group of ruins, so the sites are sometimes collectively referred to as the Hie-Naka ruins group. The area of both sites combined extends for two kilometers from north-to-south. Additionally, the Isogawa ruins, which are adjacent to the south of the Naka ruins, and the Sanno ruins, which are adjacent to the east of the Hie ruins, are considered to be part of the same complex.\nCurrently, only the Kofun period warehouse group has been designated as a national historic site and is called the \"Hie Ruins\". This site is located a block next to the west of Fukuoka City Harusumi Elementary School. In archaeological excavations, two palisade-like remains and the remains of ten pillared buildings were discovered. The pillar foundations were densely erected not only around the outside of the building, but also inside, and this is a construction typically used in raised-floor warehouses. The palisade-like remains are on the north and south sides of the survey area, and they extend from southwest to northeast, almost parallel to the current land division. The buildings vary in size, and the spacing between buildings is not uniform, but all are aligned in groups parallel to the north fence, which shows a degree of planning.  Judging from the relationship between the buildings and the remains of previous and subsequent eras, it appears that the buildings was constructed in the late 6th century and was abandoned in the late 7th century.\nIt is theorized that this is the site of a government office, and there is a high possibility that it is related to the \"Natsu official residence\" described in the Nihon Shoki, which refers to a local administrative center constructed near the mouth of the Natsu River, which served not only to control and defend northern Kyushu but to act as a window on the Asian continent and to regulate trade. As such, it could be considered the predecessor to the Dazaifu established later after the government's Ritsuryō reforms. \nThe site is approximately 1.6 kilometers southeast of Hakata Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka city home page(in Japanese)",

It is a one-page short story and was printed in 1989. His debut collection of short stories, titled Wings Entangled with the Sky, was published in 2000. His first novel, A Tree Died of Longing For, released in 2001, delves into the themes of belief and skepticism in fortune-telling. From then on, he balanced both medical practice and literary pursuits. While employed at North Okkalapa General Hospital, he translated the Harry Potter books.\nSince 2002, he has refined his style in writing short stories and novels and has also authored numerous poems. During those years, he frequently wrote screenplays for movies, with some of his screenplays earning nominations for the Myanmar Academy Awards. Additionally, he directed the popular TV show \"Puzzle Palace\" for 12 years. He directed two TV dramas: \"Duel Fight between Two Flowers\" (2017) and \"Hospital Diary\" (2018). As a film director, he also directed a feature film titled \"The Moment,\" which has yet to be released.\nHe also employed various pen names, including Thadoe Tayza and Zaw Naing Ngan Soe. Under the alias Thadoe Tayza, he authored over 40 works of fiction exploring fantastic and horror themes. Furthermore, he utilized the pseudonym \"Zaw Naing Ngan Soe\" to write over 20 detective fiction pieces.\nMin Khaike Soe San is the recipient of the 2021 Myanmar National Literature Award for Collected Short Stories for his work Gauche Stories.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nA Tree Died of Longing For (2001)\nLovers at the beginning of the world (2002)\nZero (2003)\nRaindrops for those concerned in soaking (2003)\nCoffee Evening (2004)\nNamesis and Me (2004)\nLet’s say that she is a monkey (2004)\nHeartbroken Junction of a Gypsy (2005)\nStranger (2005)\nTomorrow Programmed (2005)\nDaemon (2006)\nCowardice milksop (2009)\nBeing Pettish is hazardous for Health (2010)\nCurrency of the Kingdom of Death (2012)\nThe Bodyguard of a Birdie (2013)\n\n\n=== Collections of short stories ===\nWings Entangled with The Sky (2000)\nWorld’s Famous Ghost Stories (2002)\nNight of A Snooper (2003)\nNight at Grandeur Graveyard (2011)\nLogo for Satan (2011)\nNight of a Lion Call (2012)\nThe Last Testament of a Ghost (2012)\nA Parrot’s Mouth (2012)\nForgetful Village (2013)\nMom Killed Me (2014)\nProstitute-daughter (2015)\nEnd up this story’s finale yourself (2016)\nActor the Great (2017)\nTime out or Play on?

        "revision_id": 1223611150,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Larmanjat guided rail system was a French hybrid road-and-rail system of the nineteenth century. It sought to combine the benefits of the low friction of metal wheels running on a single metal rail with the improved tractive effort offered by wide side-wheels running on the road surface—only the side wheels were driven. Engineer Jean Larmanjat presented the apparatus at the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris and in August 1868 he opened a 5-kilometre (3-mile) demonstration line between Raincy and Montfermeil, Seine et Oise, to the east of Paris. The success of this line gained the attention of Portuguese diplomat the Duke of Saldanha for the construction of lines around Lisbon. He formed a company in London to build lines between Lisbon and Cintra and Lisbon and Torres Vedras, but these were not successful and the company was declared bankrupt in 1875. In 1873 Larmanjat was authorised to install his track on a length of towpath on the Canal de Bourgogne to haul heavy barges. He did not complete the project.\n\n\n== Demonstration at the Universal Exhibition ==\n\nThe locomotive Larmanjat demonstrated at the Paris exhibition of 1867 (the \"locomobile\") had two pivoting, double-flanged, metal wheels mounted in line and carrying most of the locomotive's weight on the single rail. Two larger wheels, one on each side and in contact with the road surface, were mounted on a cross-axle. The cross-axle was driven through  spiral bevel gear reduction and the wheels were a loose fit on the axle to allow for different rotational speeds, so easing the negotiation of turns. Drive was transmitted only when coil springs mounted in the hubs were sufficiently wound up. Whereas in normal running most of the weight fell onto the rail, when extra traction was required the locomotive was tilted by a screw mechanism moving a linear-motion slide, operated from a position on the front of the vehicle; this brought extra weight to bear onto the road wheels. On the carriages,  to reduce friction all the weight was carried by the central wheels; the side wheels served only to keep the vehicles upright.\n\n\n== Raincy and Montfermeil line ==\n\nConsequent on the success of the Paris trial, in August 1868 Larmanjat opened a 5-kilometre (3-mile) line along the existing public road between Raincy and Montfermeil, east of Paris, to demonstrate how a cheaply laid track would be sufficient where only light traffic was expected. The locomotive was again supported on a single rail, with the driving wheels and the side wheels of the carriages running on the ordinary surface of the road. On the opening day the journey from Raincy to Montfermeil (the uphill direction with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14, 7%) took 20 minutes and the return journey, with firm application of the brakes, 17. A turning curve with a radius of 5 metres (16 ft) was provided at the west end of the line, with points and a turning triangle at the east.\nRaincy was the location of a heavy artillery engagement during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, during which the line was destroyed.\n\n\n== Lisbon steam tramways ==\n\nIn March 1869 the Duke of Saldanha, Portuguese ambassador in Paris, inspected the Raincy-Montfermeil project and was persuaded of its capabilities. He built, largely at his own expense,  a 5-kilometre (3-mile) Larmanjat line between Lisbon and Lumiar. This was inaugurated on 31 January 1870.\nTo complete the Lisbon project of 100 kilometres (63 miles) of line to Torres Vedras and Cintra, more capital was needed so in London in July 1871 Saldanha set up the Lisbon Steam Tramways Company Ltd., with share capital of £200,000 (equivalent to £20,000,000 in 2019). Edwin Clark, Punchard and Company of London, an international civil engineering firm, was engaged to build and run the line, accepting shares in the new company as part payment. Francis Trevithick was appointed as chief engineer. Trevithick commissioned Sharp Stewart of Manchester to build a Larmanjat locomotive to his design, incorporating a new hydraulic mechanism to adjust the locomotive's weight distribution from within the cab, replacing the original screw mechanism. He specified that the roadway was to be supplemented by wooden planks to carry the driving wheels.\nSharp Stewart delivered the first locomotive to Buckhurst Hill, Essex, in December 1872, where a length of demonstration track had been laid. Public trials were held (with rolling stock supplied by Brown and Marshalls of Birmingham) over two days in January 1873. Performance was satisfactory on the first day, when the weather was dry, but on the second day rain made the wooden planks slippery and the driving wheels were unable to maintain sufficient traction. Nonetheless, Clark, Punchard were authorised to continue construction in Lisbon.\nThe line to Cintra was completed by February 1873 and to Torres Vedras in May.  In the conditions experienced in Portugal, Trevithick's engines and track were not successful: derailments occurred from stones obstructing the planks or the rail; in wet weather the locomotives struggled for traction on the warped and slippery planks; in dry weather gritty dust overwhelmed the passengers and entered the working parts of the locomotives, causing frequent breakdowns.\nAfter 22 months in operation, always running at a loss, the Lisbon Steam Tramways Company was deemed to have \"completely failed in [its] undertaking\", and on 16 July 1875 it was made the subject of a winding up order in  the Chancery Division of the High Court in London.\nPunchard and Clark, the contractors appointed by the promoting company, were the subject of legal proceedings alleging fraud—it was claimed that they had employed financier Albert Grant dishonestly to \"ramp\" the price of their shares in the tramway company. It was stated in court that Grant had bribed financial journalists to report favourably on the investment with one, Marmaduke Sampson, the city editor of The Times, receiving £275. The plaintiff (a dissatisfied shareholder) was awarded the purchase price of his shares.\n\n\n== Other proposed lines ==\nIn September 1869, citing the success of the Raincy-Montfermeil line, Larmanjat applied for authorisation to build a line along departmental road 3 from Joigny to Toucy, Department de L'Yonne. Public consultation was ordered and in April 1874 (by which time the indifferent performance of the Larmanjat tramways at Lisbon had become evident) permission was refused.\nLarmanjat secured authorisation to build a 15-kilometre (9-mile) line on public roadways from Lausanne to Échallens,  canton of Vaud, Switzerland, in June 1872.  The promoting company, Compagnie du chemin de fer de Lausanne à Echallens, sent an engineer to witness the Raincy trial and he reported unfavourably: He found that the locomotive had a tendency to leave its track and wander to the left and right \"like a wheelbarrow (une brouette)\". Instead, the existing roadway was widened to accommodate conventional metre-gauge track, but the nickname \"La Brouette\" continued in use long after the new line was opened.\n\n\n== Canal de Bourgogne ==\nIn January 1873 Larmanjet secured a 40-year concession for towpath haulage of barges between Roche and St-Jean-de-Losne on the Canal de Bourgogne, a distance of 240 kilometres (150 miles). He reasoned that the centre rail would resist any tendency for the boats to pull  the locomotives sideways into the water, and that fragile canal banks would bear the weight of his small engines better than that of highway traction engines. The system was tested in July 1873 but after three years of delay it was abandoned.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEwing system\nCaillet monorail\n\n\n== References ==",

They attempt to deliver a bill to a burly French-Canadian lumberjack Jacques LaPierre who beats them up. Jacques is appalled by how weak Ren and Stimpy are, and decides to teach them to be lumberjacks as a way to \"man up\" the duo. Jacques tells Ren and Stimpy that they must cut a tree and warns them of the Spiny Tree Lobsters that attack lumberjacks. Ren and Stimpy attempt to find a tree to cut down and are literally incapable of seeing a tree for a forest. Finally, the duo find a lone tree and decide to cut it down. After trying for several hours, a Tree Lobster who sounds like Moe Howard from The Three Stooges appears and takes Ren hostage. The Tree Lobster shows Ren various animals in their habit and asks Ren what he has learned. Ren replies that he has learned that \"nature can be cruel, but I can be crueler!\" Ren uses a steamroller to cut down the tree. The Tree Lobster is revealed to be Jacques in disguise. Jacques says that Ren has what it takes to be a lumberjack. Ren, Stimpy and Jacques end the day in a whirlpool Jacuzzi.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nJacques LaPierre-voice of Billy West\nTree Lobster-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was illustrated at the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul in the summer of 1994.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski gave Lumber Jerks two stars out of five.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

The skirmishes took place between troops of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the Border Security Force (BSF) on the poorly-marked international border between the two countries.\nThe clashes began on 1 November, When for more than a month, India and Bangladesh had engaged in a gunbattle at the border town of BeIonia in northeastern India. Bangladesh Rifles had fired nearly a hundred rounds into a river islet at Belonia, a small subdivisional town in South Tripura. While three companies of the Bangladesh Rifles have been deployed to man a single border outpost, about as many troops now guard the 50 km railway track between Belonia railway station which is in Feni - the principal town of the Bangladeshi district of Noakhali.\n\n\n== Background ==\nYears, After the victory of the Battles of Belonia Bulge by the Mukti Bahini and allied Indian troops The Belonia issue was almost settled in 1974 when Mrs Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman agreed to the general principle of watershed. It was decided that in all cases of riverline boundaries the midstream would be regarded as the border. And that both sides would take steps to ensure that the rivers did not change their course, Unfortunately it was not settled.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThe joint boundaries commission was to meet in the first week of November to finalise the Belonia border within the framework of the Indira-Mujib agreement. Officials of the two countries held a flag meeting. However, on 15 August 1975 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family was killed, and Zia became president in 1977, and in 1977, Indira Gandhi lost the election, years later, in October 1979, Bangladesh said, it should be regarded as no-man's-land and farmers on the Indian side should be refrained from harvesting in no-man's-land. The Indian side did not agree, Indian peasants began harvesting the paddy they had sown. Bangladesh Rifles and the Border Security Force both exchanged fire in the beginning days of November, thus starting intense gunbattles between the two sides.\n\n\n== Conflict ==\nBangladesh Rifles and Indian Border Security Forces exchanged fired near the Comilla-Tripura border throughout the entire month of November to December 1979. The shooting appears to have become a habit with the soldiers on both sides. A joint survey team of India and Bangladesh visited the area and watched bullets flying across the disputed land for 90 minutes. No fatalities or injuries were reported.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the three-day talks, the two delegations issued a brief joint statement in which, both sides have agreed to exercise maximum restraint and avoid provocation to ensure the return of normalcy in the Muhuri Char area of the Belonia sector on the Tripura-Comilla border. This merely means that the two sides will not resort to exchange of firings on the disputed 44-acre stretch of land.\nExchange of firing ended, but the talks had later partially failed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2001 Bangladesh–India Border Clashes\n2005 Bangladesh-India Border Clashes\n2019 Bangladesh-Indian Border Clash\n1958 East Pakistan-India Border Clashes\nDeaths along the Bangladesh–India Border\nBorder Guard Bangladesh\nBorder Security Force\nA.

        "content": "Blazing Entrails is the fourth episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 15 October 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen becomes concerned when Stimpy acts even more moronically than usual. Ren takes Stimpy to see Dr. Brainchild, but first must find obtain the permission of his mother. Dr. Brainchild is an immature boy with an enormous brain. After examining Stimpy, Dr. Brainchild says that Stimpy will die of his terminal stupidity unless Ren enters him to find out what is wrong. Dr. Brainchild inflates Stimpy and Ren enters his body via his rectum. Ren goes to Stimpy's stomach where he marries an antibody. After spending a year raising his family, Ren remembers his mission. Ren goes to Stimpy's brain where he discovers that Stimpy's \"ignorant gland\" is destroying his brain. After fighting the rouge gland, Ren receives a message from Dr. Brainchild telling him that he must leave Stimpy's brain or be trapped there forever. Ren does not make out in time.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nCorncob-voice of Bob Camp\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nDr. Brainchild-voice of Bill Mumy\nDr. Brainchild's mother-voice of June Lockhart\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe Games Animation studio had hired the Big Cartoons studio to work as a subcontractor for the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show to take advantage of the lower value of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Arthur Filloy had been sent to Australia to supervise the work of the Mr. Big Cartoons studio for Blazing Entrails. Filloy had left The Ren & Stimpy Show after completing Blazing Entrails as he felt that the rate of being paid $6 for every foot of animation to be too low. Filloy was unaware that the Mr. Big studio had informed Games Animation that he was still working on the show. Filloy recalled: \"It got a phone call from a rather irate Jim Ballantine, asking me what the fuck I was doing. Ballantine told me that I was supposed to be directing Ren & Stimpy over at Mr. Big. I was just as confused as he was, and I informed him that I had only timed one cartoon and gave it up. He asked if [Mr. Big had approached me since then], I said nope and boy did he get sore. Ballatine said he'd be in Sydney within three days. A day or so later, I get a phone call from Jim and he was furious, he wanted to talk over at my house and there he told me how he kicked [Mr. Big's] ass. He got me off their contract and hired me directly at Games. We struck a deal that I would get paid a good salary from Games, but I was to direct all the cartoons at Mr. Big\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski gave Blazing Entrails three stars out of five.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "The hafnium nitrides are the various salts produced from combining hafnium and nitrogen.  The two most important such are hafnium(III) nitride, HfN; and hafnium(IV) nitride, Hf3N4.  None can be prepared from hafnium oxide, but must instead be prepared from the elemental metal or a different hafnium nitride salt; attempted nitridation of the oxide gives an oxynitride instead.  \nHfN is refractory and generally produced as a thin film coating, although zone annealing gives the bulk material.   HfN adopts the rock-salt crystal structure.  The surplus hafnium electron delocalizes, so that HfN is a metal, conducting at room temperature and superconducting below 8.8 K (−443.83 °F).  Its bright gold color is a cheaper alternative to gilding.  \nThe dark red semiconductor Hf3N4 does not form at room temperature, but requires high pressure, high temperature synthesis in a diamond anvil cell.  At 18 GPa (180,000 atm) and 2,800 K (4,580 °F), it adopts the cubic crystal structure and repeats according to space group I{{{1}}}3d.  At lower pressures, the cubic structure is believed metastable, decaying to the orthorhombic structure of zirconium(IV) nitride.  That structure forms outright at 19 GPa and 2,000 K (3,140 °F), and another metastable tetragonal structure forms at 12 GPa and 1,500 K (2,240 °F).  Computational studies suggest that it may catalyze polymerization of nitrogen at very high temperatures, through a catenary anion in HfN10.  \nIn systems with limited nitrogen, hafnium also forms Hf3N2, as well as a solid solution hafnium alloy.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pseudo-feminism, also known as fake feminism or feminism appropriation, refers to the act of co-opting feminist rhetoric and ideologies for purposes that contradict or undermine the goals of feminism. It involves using the language and imagery of feminism to promote ideologies, products, or actions that reinforce traditional gender roles, objectification, or oppression of women.\nPseudo-feminism is often criticized as a form of pinkwashing, where corporations or organizations try to market themselves as supportive of women's rights and feminist values while engaging in practices that harm or exclude women. It can also manifest as individuals or groups claiming to be feminists while promoting misogynistic, anti-feminist, or regressive views.\nCritics argue that pseudo-feminism can be damaging as it co-opts and dilutes the meaning of feminism, undermining the efforts of genuine feminist movements. It is seen as a form of cultural appropriation, exploiting feminist discourse for personal gain or commercial interests without understanding or commitment to the underlying principles.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nIn the pursuit of gender equality and justice, the concept of feminism has played a pivotal role in shaping society. However, a distorted version of feminism, known as pseudo-feminism, has emerged and begun to tarnish its reputation. Pseudo-feminism refers to the misuse of feminist principles and laws, often resulting in false accusations and harm to innocent individuals.\nOne of the most significant impacts of pseudo-feminism is the misuse of rights and laws intended for the protection of women. This can lead to false accusations of sexual harassment, assault, and other forms of abuse. These false claims can have severe consequences for the accused, including damage to their reputation, mental health, and even suicide, Just like Manav Singh case.\nFalse accusations can also create a skewed perception of reality, as they may lead to increased mistrust and hostility between men and women. This imbalance in gender relations can hinder the progress of genuine feminist causes, as the focus shifts from equality to personal grudges and ego.\nMoreover, pseudo-feminism can undermine the credibility of actual cases of abuse, making it difficult for victims to receive the support and justice they deserve. The constant fear of false accusations can also create a sense of reluctance among men to engage in normal interactions with women, further straining relationships.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "IC 1182 is a type S0-a lenticular galaxy located in Hercules. It is located 464 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered on August 11, 1892, by Stephane Javelle. IC 1198 is a member of the Hercules Cluster, which is a part of the CfA 2 Great Wall.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIC 1182 was originally classified as a Seyfert type 2 galaxy but later, research shows it is an unusual and rare galaxy in some kind of merger event. A jet which is extending out from the center in an easterly direction is composed of kinetic material. There is a broad, faint S-shaped plume and debris on the other side of the galaxy. IC 1182 radiates a lot of energy and ejects a substantial amount of material at high velocity. In its central region, clusters of O-type hot blue stars are present.\n\n\n== An ongoing merger? ==\nIC 1182 shows high resolution broad and narrow band images and long slit spectroscopy. It reveals a distorted morphology with a heavily obscured disk-link structure with several knots in its regions.  Some of the galactic material, in the form of two slender tails are detected beyond the main body of the galaxy. IC 1182 has color indices of an early type object which is significantly bluer than what is typical for this kind of galaxy. The narrow lines show this galaxy is a powerful emitter and the knots in the central region and inside the tail emerging eastward from the galaxy are luminous in Hα and have typical sizes of 1 kpc.\nAdditionally, IC 1182 contains large quantities of neural hydrogen which its distance-independent ratio of hydrogen mass to optical luminosity is equal to 0.7 times the solar ratio. This could indicate it might be involved in a collision involving a gas-rich spiral galaxy which gives rise to observed nuclear emission lines.\n\n\n== References ==",

The film was released to mixed-to-negative reviews.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRavi Kale as Umesh Reddy\nRoopika as Roopa\nSadhu Kokila as a police officer\nSharath Lohitashwa as Hanumantha\nBullet Prakash\nShobha Raghavendra as Umesh's mother\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was initially titled Khatarank Umesh Reddy before being shortened to Khataranak after the release of a similarly film titled Umesh (2013). The film was given an A certificate.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA critic from Rediff.com rated the film two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"Khatarnaak is devoid of entertainment or any elements that entertain. It is violence, sex and gore. But, the movie is a wake up call for vigilance in our neighbourhood\". A critic from The Times of India rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Though director Malavalli Saikrishna has brilliantly presented each of his criminal acts with a firm grip over script and narration, the message he is sending to the youth through this movie is questionable. There is sex, violence and killings that were part of Umesh’s life\". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote that \"The film is strictly for those who want to watch ‘soft porn’ on big screen. But it is the first 15 minutes or so that actually titillate. The rest of it is just plain documentary of a serial killer's life\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKhatarnak at IMDb",

        "content": "John Tait Orr (15 December 1888 – 13 May 1971) was a Scottish footballer who played as an inside forward. Having moved from Newtongrange Star to Blackburn Rovers as a teenager in January 1908, he was often a reserve for the likes of Eddie Latheron, Jock Simpson, Danny Shea and compatriot Walter Aitkenhead, but had a role in the squads which won the English Football League championship in 1911–12 and 1913–14. Towards the end of the latter season, he was selected for the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match, but this did not lead on to a full cap.\nThe outbreak of the First World War in 1914 disrupted football and led to official competitions in England being cancelled a year later; during the conflict, Orr agreed to play some matches for Blackburn's local rivals Burnley and also featured for Preston North End, but otherwise missed out on what would probably have been the peak years of his sporting career, and joined the British Army in 1917. He remained on Blackburn's books until the end of the 1919–20 season, but made only three post-war league appearances due to injury (despite some callous newspaper reports having predicted that after demobilisation from the armed forces, \"he is certain of his place now\" – Latheron having been killed in the war). Orr returned to Scotland and made a comeback in his 30s playing for hometown club Leith Athletic in minor competitions including the Scottish Football Alliance, and for two seasons in the Scottish Football League Division Three. A benefit match was played for him in 1926.\nHis uncle Willie Orr was also a football player (Celtic, Scotland) and manager (Airdrieonians, Leicester City).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yustina Vladimirovna Kruzenshtern-Peterets (Russian: Юсти́на Влади́мировна Крузенште́рн-Пе́терец; June 19, 1903 – June 8, 1983) was a Russian-born journalist, poet, and author.\nAfter spending much of her childhood in Harbin, China, Kruzenshtern-Peterets became a significant contributor to Russian diaspora publications both there and in Shanghai. After the Communist takeover, she left for Brazil and later the United States, where she worked both for Voice of America and for Russian-language media in New York and California. In addition to her journalistic writing, she produced short stories and poetry, which was heavily influenced by her youth in China. \n\n\n== Birth and family ==\nYustina Kruzenshtern was born in 1903 in Vladivostok, in what was then the Russian Empire. She was descended from the Estonian noble family that included the famous admiral Adam Johann von Krusenstern. Her father, a captain, died fighting in World War I.\n\n\n== Life in China ==\nDuring the wave of migration amid the Russian Revolution, she emigrated with her mother and brother to Harbin, China, where she had already spent a portion of her childhood while her father was stationed there. Her time in China left a significant impact on her work as a writer, and she would later identify the country as her \"second motherland.\" After settling in Harbin, she began contributing to the local newspaper Gong Bao and magazine Rubezh. She was involved in the young writers association Churaevka, alongside such Russian diaspora writers as Valery Pereleshin, Alexey Achair, and Larissa Andersen.\nIn late 1930, she moved to Shanghai. There, she worked as a feuilletonist and political columnist for the newspaper Shanghai Dawn from 1931 to 1934, as well as for the English-language North China Daily News, as she spoke fluent English. She was also fluent in French, and translated books from French in this period. In addition to her journalistic writing, she published works of poetry, including the 1946 collection Poems. Book 1. Her work helped her to support her chronically ill mother and brother. While in Shanghai, in 1935, she married the poet Nikolai Peterets, whom she had met in Harbin and moved to Shanghai with. He died young in 1944, of tuberculosis, a tragedy that would mark the rest of Kruzenshtern-Peterets' life.\nDuring World War II, she was a vocal \"defencist.\" She also opposed Zhdanovism, in 1948 publishing the magazine Antigone, which aimed to reflect the \"free thought\" of Russians in the Far East and contained articles about the life of the intelligentsia in the Soviet Union. Throughout her career, she wrote under many pseudonyms, including Snorre, Sibilla Ven, T. Stern, and Merry Devil.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nKruzenshtern-Peterets left China for Brazil in the 1950s, following the Chinese Communist Revolution, and then in the early 1960s moved to the United States. There, she spent 10 years working for the Russian department of the U.S. government's Voice of America broadcaster, and she wrote for the New Russian Word newspaper. She also continued to write poetry, and in 1969 she published a short story collection, Ulybka psishi. After her retirement from VOA, she settled in the San Francisco area, where starting in 1982 she worked as an editor for the newspaper Russian Life. She died in San Mateo in 1983, at the age of 79.\n\n\n== External links ==\nKruzenshtern-Peterets (IU.) papers at the Online Archive of California\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "André Vieira Dias Rodrigues Mingas Júnior, also known by his artistic name André Gasmin (24 May 1950 – 11 October 2011), was an Angolan musician, architect, urbanist, professor, and politician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMingas was born on 24 May 1950 in Luanda, the son of André \"Mongone\" Rodrigues Mingas and Antónia Diniz de Aniceto Vieira Dias. Some of his other siblings were also prominent figures in Angolan history, namely politician, singer, and composer of the Angolan national anthem Ruy Mingas, linguist and teacher Amélia Mingas, athlete and administrator Júlia Rodrigues Mingas, police commander José \"Zé\" Rodrigues Mingas, and economist, writer, and politician Saíde Mingas.\nHaving begun his direction towards music at an early age, he was strongly influenced by his uncle Liceu Vieira Dias and his brother Ruy. His first album was \"Coisas da Vida\", considered to be an important mark in Angolan popular music, mixing jazz, rock, and semba. Through this he also became a pioneer of the semba-jazz subgenre. Highlights of the album include \"Esperança\", \"Mufete\" e \"Chipalepa\".\nBy the 1970s, he began associating with artists such as Filipe Mukenga and Waldemar Bastos, both of whom strongly influenced him, primarily through the adoption of dissonance.\nAfter the independence of Angola, he became one of the founders of the Angolan Artists' Union. He graduated from Agostinho Neto University with a degree in architecture and later earned a masters' degree in architecture and urbanism from the Technical University of Lisbon. In Portugal, he became a professor of architecture at the Universidade Lusófona in Lisbon.\nAfter he returned to Angola, he became the vice-minister of Education and Culture, a period in which he organized the Society of Angolan Authors (SAA), the conglomeration of smaller and larger educational institutes in order to better sponsor contemporary art in Angola.\nAs an architect, he was against the large-scale real estate speculation that affected the province of Luanda beginning in the 1990s, becoming an especially strong critic of the demolition of the old Quinaxixe Market. Despite this, he was assigned, in 2006, to lead the reevaluation of the structural integrity of buildings in various neighborhoods around Luanda, as well as becoming responsible for the expansion of the neighborhoods of Talatona and Belas.\nOn 12 October 2006, president José Eduardo dos Santos named him as secretary of Local Subjects of the Presidency of Angola. He was later named the Angolan consul in São Paulo, Brazil. He was already in the city, but died before he could assume the position on 11 October 2011.\n\n\n== References ==",

ISCAP's main stronghold was Beni Territory in North Kivu, and the group launched its first attack against a Congolese military camp in Beni. In the days leading up to the prison break, the Islamic State announced a \"Breaking the Walls\" campaign intended on breaking IS militants out of prisons. The Kangbayi prison in Beni had been attacked once before in June 2017, and prior to the attack held a large number of ADF fighters. The mayor of Beni, Modeste Bakwanamaha, stated that there had been rumors before the attack about a planned break-out. The United Nations estimated that the prison held 1,456 inmates before the breakout.\n\n\n== Prison break ==\nThe break-out occurred at 4:30 am local time, and a large number of ADF militants broke the door down with electrical equipment. The attack began with militants ambushing a Congolese military position on the Lao hill overlooking the prison and military base. Both ISCAP and the ADF claimed responsibility for an attack on the prison and military camp shortly afterward. 1,335 prisoners escaped the prison during the break-out, and 100 stayed. During the break-out, two prisoners were shot and killed. The prisoners included ADF militants and Mai-Mai fighters.\nTwenty inmates later returned to Kangbayi prison and surrendered themselves to Congolese authorities, along with identifying the perpetrators of the break-out as ADF. The United Nations dispatched a patrol of peacekeepers to the Kangbayi prison after the break-out. Bakwanahama urged residents of Beni to be suspicious of people who might be escapees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The ceremony of Hae Nang Maew (Thai and Khmer: Procession of Lady Cat) is a traditional folklore rainmaking ritual cat procession which can be seen in Cambodia as well as Central and Northeast Thailand in times of drought, from May until August.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Traditional procession of the Siamese cats ===\nSisawat Siamese cats or otherwise black cats are selected and put in a bamboo or rattan baskets  covered with a lid to avoid the cat from escaping. Cloud-colored cats or black cats are preferable, believed to provide fortune. The basket is hung to a wooden or bamboo pole carried by two porters. Five pairs of candles and five paired flowers. The eldest among the ritual performers kicks off the procession by asking the cat to provide rain for the land after which the procession along with the musical band walk through the streets of the village asking the bystanders to pour water on the cat.\nThe procession usually takes place when the drought becomes a matter of concern for the peasants. Normally villagers begin planting as soon as rains arrived after Royal Ploughing Ceremony in early May. Without rainfall after this ceremony, villagers usually decide to hold the cat parade.\n\n\n=== Music and song ===\nThe cat procession is lively and animated like the Trot dance by a musical band consisting of drums, gongs, cymbals and claves. and singing which varies in various locations but lyrics are often close to this ancient tune:“Rain, rain, come pouring down. We barely had any this year. Without rain, our rice will die.”\n\n\n=== Modern Tradition ===\nWhile this procession is still done as such in Cambodia, in Thailand, the \"curious tradition\" has been updated to avoid what could be interpreted as animal torture, cats being notoriously afraid of water. In order to avoid animal-torture criticism, in Isan, the cat has sometimes been replaced by a stuffed teddy bear. Even more, in Uttaradit, children as well as their parents replace the cats by dressing up as tomcats and putting on make-up to impersonate the felines. Villages in Tamnak Tham Subdistrict, Nong Muang Khai District, Phrae Province make fake cats from bamboo frame and coconut husks named \"Nong Saifon\". Hello Kitty or Doraemon dummies have also been used as replacements.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nAccording to Thai anthropologist Phraya Anuman Rajadhon, cats dislike being wet and have since olden days been associated with causing droughts. And to lift the curse, they are therefore drenched with water. The procession was often linked to royal rituals and its name itself refers to the cat as Neang Maew or \"Princess Cat\", showing the place of honor given to the animal carried around in a form of palanquin.\nSimilar to medieval European propitiatory rites such as Kattenstoet, the hope in performing this procession is that it would once again \"rain cats and dogs\". If a cat cries out during the ceremony, it means that rain is imminent. Khmer and Thai people hope that rain will come from 3 to 7 days after the ceremony. This hae nang maew not only boosts their morale about the rainfall, it also helps to reinforce the unity of the village folks, because practicing this old ritual custom requires communal participation and efforts.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe rainmaking ritual of Hae Nang Maew is mostly practiced by Thai farmers in both the central and northeast region of the country. It is also celebrated in Cambodia, though it is unclear where the rite originated, whether it be in the Angkorian civilization for centuries or more recently in Laos.\n\n\n== References ==",

They are located 977 million light-years from the solar system and were discovered on July 28, 1892, by Stephane Javelle.\n\n\n== Galaxies ==\nIC 1166 NED01\nIC 1166 NED01 or PGC 56771 is a type E elliptical galaxy. Located above IC 1166 NED02, it has a diameter of approximately 110,000 light-years. PGC 56771 has an active nucleus and it is classified as a Seyfert type 1 galaxy. It has a quasar-like appearance, but its host clearly seen and presents two sets of emission lines which are superimposed on each other. PGC 56771 is classified a Markarian galaxy (designated Mrk 867), because compared to other galaxies its nucleus emits excessive amounts of ultraviolet rays.  It has a surface brightness of 23.2 magnitude and, located at right ascension (16:02:08.92) and declination (26:19:45.60) respectively.\nIC 1166 NED02\nIC 1166 NED02 or PGC 1771884 is a type SBbc spiral galaxy. Located below IC 1166 NED01, it has an approximate diameter of 160,000 light-years making it slightly larger compared to the other galaxy and does not have an active galactic nucleus. PGC 1771884 has a surface brightness of 23.4 magnitude and, a right ascension of (16:02:08.83) and declination (26:19:31.20).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Valdur-Olev Ohakas (December 26, 1925 – February 16, 1998) was an Estonian painter.\n\n\n== Ealy life and education ==\nValdur Ohakas was born in Tallinn, Estonia, the son of Johannes Ohakas (1900–1979) and Agathe Elise Ohakas (née Kirnmann, 1903–1997). The artist Raoul Kernumees was his maternal uncle. He attended Tallinn Primary School No. 21, Tallinn Middle School No. 2, Tallinn Trade School, and Tallinn Evening Technical School. From 1942 to 1943, he studied at the Tallinn School of Fine and Applied Arts under Eerik Haamer and Johannes Greenberg. From 1943 to 1944, he was mobilized into the German army. From 1944 to 1948, he studied at the Tartu State Art Institute under Johannes Võerahansu and Elmar Kits, but he did not graduate from the school because in 1949 he was arrested with a group of art students and sent to the Vorkuta Gulag in the Karaganda Region of the Kazakh SSR. He was released in 1956.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOhakas started showing his works at exhibitions in 1946, and in 1959 he became a member of the Artists Union of the Estonian SSR. Ohakas participated in the renewal of Estonian art in the 1960s, and he was in close contact with Ülo Sooster and many artists from Tartu and Tallinn. The height of Ohakas's work was the 1960s and 1970s, when romantic landscapes were central to his versatile creations.\n\n\n== Works ==\nOhakas's work in the late 1950s was characterized by the \"harsh style\" (Estonian: karm stiil) (e.g., Pirita, 1959). At the beginning of the 1960s, he mainly cultivated still lifes, in which color and the light–dark contrast become increasingly important (e.g., Natüürmort kaladega 'Still Life with Fish', 1965; Vanad asjad 'Old Things', 1968). Starting with the end of the 1960s, his geometrizing style often reached the point of being abstract or surreal (e.g., Natüürmort kannuga 'Still Life with a Pitcher', 1970; Linn 'City', 1973; Antiik 'Antiquity', 1974). In the 1960s and 1970s, romantic landscape visions took center stage (e.g., Mütoloogiline maastik 'Mythological Landscape', 1971; Järvede org sügisel 'Valley of Lakes in Autumn', 1978; Tee 'Road', 1982).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Braywick House, for most of its history called \"Braywick Grove\", is an English country house now converted to offices. It is a historic Grade II* listed building located in Braywick, Berkshire, a suburb south of Maidenhead.\n\n\n== History ==\nBraywick House was built in 1675 for Sir William Paule (also spelled Paul and Paull) (c.1632-1685), Paule was the son of Dr. William Paul, Bishop of Oxford (1599–1665).\nHe died childless, so when his widow Mary (later Lady Penyston, second wife of Sir Fairmeadow Penyston, the last of the Penyston baronets, of Leigh), died in 1714, the house reverted to the family of William's brother James, which at that point consisted only of James' granddaughter Catherine (-1753). In 1724 she married Sir William Stapleton, 4th Stapleton Baronet (1698–1740). While they maintained ownership of Braywick, the Stapleton family's primary residence was at Greys Court, nearby in Oxfordshire, which Catherine had also inherited.\nIn around 1783, the house was acquired by the Hon. Thomas Windsor (1752–1832), the second son of Other Windsor, 4th Earl of Plymouth. A former Royal Navy Captain, Thomas Windsor had made his fortune by capturing Spanish ships in the Caribbean. In 1802, while living in Braywick, he was High Sheriff of Berkshire. According to subsequent descriptions of the property, he enlarged and remodeled the house in the then-current Georgian style.\nThe house was sold in c.1808 to captain, later Major-General, Sir Thomas Anburey (1759–1849). Anburey then listed Braywick for sale when he was sent to India in 1818. He would go on to lead the Bengal Sappers and Miners in Allahabad.\nIn 1833, William Atkins-Bowyer (1779–1844) is listed as residing at the property.\nBy 1839 the home was owned by Richard Boucher (sometimes spelled Bouchier) (1754–1841) who was vicar of Brightwalton in Berkshire for 53 years between 1788 and 1841. And in 1842 Richard's widow, Rebecca Coney Boucher, bequeathed the estate to her nephew, John Jeane Coney. Coney (d. 1862) came from a Batcombe, Somerset family. His grandfather, Bicknell Coney (1732–1812), was a director of the Bank of England.\nBraywick House remained in the Coney family until the early part of the 20th century. While still owned by the Coneys, the house was sometimes rented. For example, in the first years of the 20th century, the home was the residence of Liberal Party politician Henry Bernhard Samuelson, later the 2nd of the Samuelson baronets.\nIn 1907 the property was sold to Sir James Richardson Andrew Clark, 2nd Baronet Clark, (1852–1948), son of prominent doctor Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet (1826–1893). It then passed to his son, Sir Andrew Clark, 3rd Baronet (1898–1979).\nThe house was converted to office and storage space in 1959. Some companies that have since had offices there include Shooting Times, Crescent Life Assurance, Pandair Freight, Schneider Electric, and NEC.\nIn 1983 textile design firm Laura Ashley moved their UK Retail Headquarters there. Additional building updates were done then and in the mid-1990s.\nThe house, now part of a busy commercial corridor, remains office space.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nA red brick house, originally a Stuart-period design, but remodeled and expanded in the mid-to-late 18th century to a more Georgian style. The front is plain with two wings that project slightly. Inside, the main staircase is the original from the 17th century. There is good mid-18th century Rococo plasterwork that Pevsner compares to houses by Sir Robert Taylor. The 19th century coach house is now part of the office conversion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoyal Berkshire History – Braywick\nHistoric England – Braywick House",

        "content": "Henry Wynne (born 18 April 1995) is an American middle-distance runner who specializes in the 1500 m and mile. Competing for the University of Virginia, he was the 2016 NCAA indoor mile champion.\nAfter graduating from Virginia in 2017, he joined the Brooks Beasts Track Club and has since set personal bests of 3:34.08 in the 1500 m and 3:51.26 in the mile. He is a two time US Indoor Championship runner-up and in April 2024, was part of a Brooks Beasts quartet that set the world record in the DMR.\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\n\n\n=== High School ===\nIn 2013, during his senior year at Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, Wynne won national titles in the mile indoors and out at New Balance Nationals Indoor and New Balance Nationals Outdoor. He graduated from high school with personal bests of 1:49.93 in the 800 m, 4:05.04 in the mile, and 9:04.34 in the 3200 m and with a total of 22 Connecticut state titles and 5 New England titles.\n\n\n=== University of Virginia ===\nIn fall of 2013, Wynne enrolled at the University of Virginia, joining the Virginia Cavaliers cross country and track and field teams. After redshirting his freshman cross country season, Wynne made his Virginia debut during the 2014 indoor season where he would run a personal best of 4:04.37 in the mile and go on to place eighth at the ACC Indoor Championships in the same event. Outdoors, he ran 3:46.48 over 1500 m and finishing his freshman season placing eighth at the USA Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon.\nIn 2015, Wynne placed fifth at the ACC Indoor Championships in the mile and finished sixth as part of Virginia's DMR at the NCAA Indoor Championships. In June, he qualified for the NCAA Outdoor Championships in the 1500 m, but failed to advance to the final.\n\nDuring the 2016 indoor season, he broke four minutes in the mile for the first time, running 3:58.74 at the John Thomas Terrier Invitational in Boston. In February, ACC titles in the mile and DMR, and on March 12, competing at the NCAA Indoor Championships in Birmingham, Alabama, he took first place in the mile in 4:06.63.\nAfter setting a 3:38.05 personal best in April and taking the ACC 1500 m title in May, Wynne placed third at the 2016 NCAA Outdoor Championships, finishing behind Clayton Murphy and Izaic Yorks. Later that summer, he represented the United States at the NACAC U23 Championships, winning gold in the 1500 m.\nAfter missing the 2016 fall cross country season due to a knee injury, Wynne placed second in mile at the 2017 ACC Indoor Championships in February and placed fifth at the ACC Outdoor Championships in the 1500 m. However, his high hopes of a strong showing at his final NCAA Outdoor Championships were squashed after a bout of pneumonia just before the East Regional Qualifier, causing him to place just eleventh in his heat, dashing his hopes of qualifying for a final NCAAs.\nWynne competed at the 2017 USA Championships in Sacramento, California, placing 33rd overall.\n\n\n=== Brooks Beasts ===\nFollowing his 2017 season and the conclusion of his collegiate career, Wynne signed professionally with Brooks, joining the Brooks Beasts Track Club under coach Danny Mackey. Just two days before he signed the contract, he underwent knee surgery, something him and Mackey had hidden from Brooks during contract negotiations, causing the Brooks sports marketing department to be \"very unhappy\" when they learned of it.\nComing off his operation, he struggled through the 2018 season, but managed personal bests of 3:55.23 in the mile and 13:30.43 over 5000 m. \n\nIn early 2019, Wynne finished second at the USA Indoor Championships and ran a mile personal best of 3:51.26, placing him sixth on the all-time US list at the time. Later that year, he ran a 3:35.14 1500 m PB in Seattle and finished eighth in the at the USA Outdoor Championships.\nIn May 2021, he ran a 1500 m personal best of 3:34.08 to take fourth at the Portland Track Festival. The following month, at the 2020 US Olympic Trials (held in 2021), Wynne placed fifth in 3:37.70.\nIn 2022, Wynne placed third over 1500 m at the USA Indoor Championships and qualified for the 1500 m final at the USA Outdoor Championships, placing twelfth in 3:48.03.\nAt the Boston University Last Chance Indoor Qualifier in February 2023, Wynne ran his fasted mile since 2019, clocking a time of 3:52.51 to take the win. At the 2023 USA Outdoor Championships in July, Wynne placed fifth in 3:35.99 and, in August, ran a 1500 seasons best of 3:34.67 to take the win at the Ed Murphy Classic in Memphis.\nOn April 19, 2024, at the Oregon Relays, Wynne, alongside Brooks Beasts teammates Brandon Kidder, Brandon Miller, and Isaiah Harris, set a world record in the distance medley relay. After a 2:49.60 1200 m leg by Kidder, a 46.60 400 leg by Miller, and a 1:45.75 800 m split from Harris, Wynne anchoring the quartet running the 1600 m leg, needed a split in the low 3:50s to secure the record. Running completely solo, he ran a split of 3:52.63, breaking the previous record of 9:15:50 set by Kyle Merber, Brycen Spratling, Brandon Johnson, and Ben Blankenship at the 2015 IAAF World Relays, by 0.92 seconds with a time of 9:14.58.\n\n\n== Championship results ==\n\n\n=== International Competitions ===\n\n\n=== USA Championships ===\n\n\n=== NCAA Championships ===\n\n\n== References ==",

Bogotá was affected by the fire in the Eastern Hills.\n\n\n== Events ==\nPresident Gustavo Petro said Wednesday that he will declare the forest fires ravaging the country a natural disaster and a state of emergency, freeing up funds to fight the fires.\nOn 26 January 2024, 138 flights at El Dorado International Airport were affected and returned to normal the next day and police arrested 26 people for \"fire-related crimes.\" The Minister of the Environment, Susana Muhamad warned that the country was at serious risk of suffering forest fires that could worsen deforestation. Nearly half of the 2 trillion peso ($508 million) budget to address problems caused by El Niño, such as fighting fires, has already been spent, according to the report. \nIn the Berlin moorland under the jurisdiction of Tona Santander, around 50 hectares of vegetation, mainly frailejones, were consumed, putting the department's water supply in check, which lasted a week of intense fires that destroyed almost the entire moorland due to high temperatures and man-made burning.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Walsham (or John of Walsham) was an English Franciscan theologian and philosopher. Born at Walsham, John obtained a doctorate in theology from the University of Cambridge. He became the lector at the Franciscan studium in Cambridge and around 1350 became the lector at their studium in Norwich. He was licensed to take confession in the diocese of Canterbury in 1358.\nAll of John's surviving works are found in a single manuscript, Oxford, Corpus Christi College, 182. It is a collection of nine questions that were disputed sometime between 1344 and 1349. John takes the position, rare for his time, that there are valid a posteriori arguments for the existence of God, but none valid a priori. He distinguishes between the task of proving the existence of a first being and the more difficult one of proving the existence of a supremely and infinitely perfect being who created the universe. In dismissing a priori proofs, like that of Thomas Bradwardine, he refers to another work of his, which has not survived.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zhenyu Yue is a Chinese academic researcher in the field of neurology and neuroscience, who is the Alex and Shirley Aidekman Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. He is known for his discovery of genes controlling autophagy (cell self-eating), autophagy functions in central nervous system, molecular mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases, and modelling neurological diseases using genetic mouse models.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nZhenyu Yue earned a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Cell Biology from Wuhan University in China in 1988. He then obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Vertebrate Genetics from the Institute of Hydrobiology at the Chinese Academy of Science, also in Wuhan, China, in 1991. In pursuit of further education, Yue relocated to the United States, where he embarked on doctoral studies in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. He conducted his Ph.D. research under the mentorship of Aaron J Shatkin, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, at UMDNJ-Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. His doctoral studies, which spanned from 1992 to 1997, focused on virus biology and mRNA modifications. The highlight of this Ph.D. thesis is the identification of human mRNA capping enzyme, which is a significant contribution to the understanding of mRNA biology, and has yielded the patent “mRNA Capping and Use thereof”.\nYue engaged in postdoctoral research at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/The Rockefeller University in New York. From 1998 to 2002, he worked under the guidance of Nathaniel Heintz, specializing in molecular biology and neuroscience. He reported the first autophagy gene disruption mouse models, which revealed a link of autophagy to tumorigenesis. Yue pioneered autophagy research in neurodegeneration using Lurcher mice.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nZhenyu Yue's research has primarily concentrated on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.\nOne of the notable areas of Yue's research involves the study of autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. His work has led to the identification of novel autophagy regulators, such as the components in Beclin 1-hVPS34 complex (class 3 PI3K), Atg14L, Rubicon, and NRBF2, which play crucial roles in the autophagy pathway. This research is significant for understanding how disruptions in cellular cleaning mechanisms can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\nYue's research has contributed to identifying and characterizing autophagy receptors, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. For instance, SQSTM1/p62, often found in Lewy bodies, tau tangles, and huntingtin aggregates, is the prototype of autophagy receptor that regulates the clearance of polyubiquitinated protein complex and aggregate through autophagy.  AKAP11, a significant risk gene for bipolar and schizophrenia, is an autophagy receptor that control PKA-RI complex degradation through autophagy.\nYue's research has extended to identifying and characterizing therapeutic targets for Parkinson’s disease (PD). For instance, he has explored the role of LRRK2 and synaptojanin 1 signalling pathway in neurodegeneration. Yue’s investigation demonstrated that vitamin B12 modulates LRRK2 kinase activity through allosteric regulation and confers neuroprotection.  Furthermore, Yue’s group has performed molecular profiling of substant nigra from the PD post-mortem brains using single nucleus RNA sequencing, and identified diverse dopamine neuron subpopulations and a novel vulnerable neuron type. His studies provided valuable resource and insight into therapeutic targets of PD.\nAfter concluding his postdoctoral tenure at The Rockefeller University in New York, Yue joined the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York in August 2004 as an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology & Neuroscience. He was promoted to associate professor with tenure in August 2008, and then full Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience in July 2013.\nYue has been the Director of Basic and Translational Research in Movement Disorders since December 2012 and Director of the Center for Parkinson’s Disease Neurobiology since July 2022.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nIn 2008, Yue was honored with the Faculty Council Award for Academic Excellence by Mount Sinai.\nYue holds the Alex and Shirley Aidekman Family Neurological Research Professorship at Mount Sinai.\nYue has been a recipient of the Sundaram Research Scholar Award from the Mount Sinai Medical Center in 2017, 2018, and 2019.\nYue has been a member of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society, since March 2024.\nIn addition to his institutional honors, Yue has been actively involved with the Chinese Biological Investigator Society (CBIS), serving as a board member since 2016.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nYue, Z.; Maldonado, E.; Pillutla, R.; Cho, H.; Reinberg, D.; Shatkin, A.

        "content": "\n= L’histoire juridique des paris sportifs au Canada =\nLe Canada est un pays qui encourage la liberté ainsi que les opportunités. À cause de ceci, les Canadiens maintiennent le droit de faire leurs choix en temps et en lieux. Les Canadiens ont le droit de choisir la religion désirée, le droit de voter, le droit de se déplacer et de gagner leur vie. Comme le Canada est un pays jeune en relation avec la ligne de temps historique, plusieurs droits et libertés ont été ajoutés aux Canadiens et continuent d’être ajoutés pour enfin rester à jour avec les temps de la population courante. De nos jours, la technologie joue un grand rôle dans la vie de tous les jours pour la plupart des personnes autour du monde. Les deux autres choses qui peuvent être assez communes à travers tout le monde sont la religion et aussi l’amour pour les sports. Tout ceci nous apporte à la raison de ce texte. \nAvec l’évolution des droits et libertés au Canada, les Canadiens ont reçu le droit de placer des paris sportifs au Canada. Les paris sportifs sont une forme de jeux d’argent qui consiste à placer des paris sur les sports. La raison que les personnes participent aux paris sportifs est à cause de la passion pour un certain sport ou une équipe certaine, ou même un joueur professionnel. Un pari sportif peut permettre aux spectateurs de ces sports professionnels d’être plus proche et plus investi dans la joute ou dans l’équipe ou le joueur pour enfin supporters et aussi démontrer leur connaissance et leur loyauté. \nAvec ceci, ce texte va porter sur l’histoire juridique des paris sportifs au Canada dès le début de son évolution qui a eu lieu dans les années 1890 jusqu’à sa réalisation en 1985 jusqu’à son évolution aux années des 2020 et le futur. Il y est aussi important de mentionner les possibilités et les conséquences dans le futur pour les paris sportifs au Canada.\nLa Légalisation des paris sportifs au Canada\nL’histoire juridique des paris sportifs au Canada a commencé à prendre racine lors des années 1890 ou les paris sportifs sont rendus illégaux au Canada, sauf pour courses de chevaux. Ceci a donc évolué en 1969 quand le gouvernement fédéral a déclenché un système de loterie. Avec ceci il y a aussi la naissance de la première installation des paris sportifs sur « proline » qui a donné le choix de faire des paris « over, under » ou le choix de choisir qui va gagner les joutes cette journée.  \nPour clarifier, un pari « over, under » consiste de faire un pari soit pour un nombre plus haut ou plus bas du nombre déterminer. Par exemple, dans le hockey il pourrait avoir un « over, under » de 5.5 buts, donc si tu fais un pari de « over », vous pariez que la joute va avoir 6 buts ou plus, pour le « under » c’est la même chose, mais pour 5 buts et en dessous. Ceci a rapidement subi une évolution quand le gouvernement fédéral a tourné et a donné la responsabilité aux gouvernements provinciaux pour enfin décentraliser le contrôle de la plupart des activités de jeu. Avec ce changement, le gouvernement provincial avait maintenant la responsabilité de prendre les décisions en matière de réglementation et d’octroi de licences, mais il faut encore que les provinces suivent les autorités exécutées par le Code pénal canadien.  \nIl y a encore des restrictions pour les joueurs des paris sportifs au Canada qui ont maintenant et seulement une méthode pour faire les paris sportifs sous la restriction de la « Proline ». Les paris sportifs ont aussi subi une autre évolution, une qui est importante dans l’histoire juridique des paris sportifs au Canada, lors de l’année 1985. En 1985, le gouvernement fédéral a fait un compromis avec les provinces en échange de 100 millions dollars, le gouvernement fédéral a changé et a fait des modifications dans le Code criminel pour enfin donner les provinces le pouvoir exclusif concernant les jeux de loteries et d’autres jeux de hasard. Il y avait encore un manquement de jeux concernant des paris de « single-game wagering », ce qui veut dire qu’il n’y a pas de façon de choisir plusieurs paris pour une seule joute. Les paris de « single-game wagering » sont simplement le fait de faire un pari pour un seul événement et les résultats d’un seul événement, au lieu d’être forcé à faire des « parlais » qui veut dire ajouter le résultat de plusieurs joutes sur un seul pari sportif.  \nEn 1989, le premier casino commercial est ouvert à Winnipeg avec un autre qui ouvre ses portes à Montréal en 1993. Lors des premières années des 2000, il y avait des plans pour utiliser les fonds pour aider les équipes professionnelles de hockey au Canada avec leurs problèmes d’argent pour enfin être capable de concourir avec les équipes américaines plus riches. Il y a des plans en place maintenant pour enfin distribuer les revenus des paris sportifs, ce qui était un plan innovant qui va affecter le futur.  \nEn 2005, les paris sportifs autour du monde commencent à évoluer de façons rapides. En 2005, le Royaume-Uni a donné le droit aux personnes canadien de faire des paris sportifs avec leurs sites européens, ils donnaient le droit de faire des paris de « simple -game wagering » et même le choix de faire les paris entièrement en ligne. Ceci était une lacune de la part du Code criminel canadien qui a enfin affecté le pourcentage du revenu que le gouvernement Canadian recevait de la part des paris sportifs en comparaison avec les sites européens. Dans les années 2005, une étude de cas a été fait concernant le montant d’argent que les sites considérer « offshore », donc les sites européens, et durant cette étude de cas, le résultat était estimé que les canadiens faisait des paris qui a représenté 14 milliards de dollars par année.  \nEn comparaison, au Canada ils ont fait des paris qui représentaient 500 millions dollars. Enfin, la légalisation des paris sportifs est venue à sa légalisation complète en 2021 quand le Canada a établi et mis en vie l’adoption du projet de loi C-218 nommée la « Loi sur le pari sportif sécuritaire et réglementé » qui a légalisé les paris sportifs à jeu unique ici au Canada.  \n L’évolution des paris sportifs au Canada\nMaintenant, il est le temps de discuter de l’évolution que les paris sportifs ont subi au Canada concernant le projet de loi C-218 et les évolutions qui continuent à avoir lieu de nos jours. Le projet de loi C-218 est venu en place lors de l’année 2013 quand le député Brian Masse a lancé la première tentative pour lever l’interdiction des paris sportifs sur un seul match « single-game wagering » au Canada, mais cette première tentative a failli. Brian Masse a aussi fait une autre tentative en 2016, mais encore une fois cette tentative a failli. En 2020, un autre député, Kevin Waugh, lance la troisième tentative pour mettre fin à l’interdiction des paris sportifs sur un seul match au Canada. Cette troisième tentative a fini par recevoir un soutien important de la part de plusieurs partis et a fini par devenir un projet de loi du gouvernement en novembre de cette année. En 2021, le projet de loi C-218 a été adopté par le Parlement canadien afin d’aider et créer un marché canadien pour les paris sportifs. À partir du 27 août 2021, les paris sportifs sur un seul événement sont légaux. \nPresque immédiatement après l’adoption du projet de loi C-218, il y avait sept loteries provinciales qui ont lancé des produits de paris sportifs. L’évolution des paris sportifs continue à progresser en 2022 quand l’Ontario devient la première province canadienne à autoriser les paris sportifs en ligne externes d’exercer leur service au Canada, ceci fait que les joueurs peuvent utiliser des sites externes à leurs avantages puisqu’il y a maintenant plusieurs chances différentes et beaucoup plus de choix pour les joueurs des paris sportifs. Plusieurs compagnies comme TheScore Bet, BetMGM et Draftkings sont devenues des principaux sites pour faire des paris sportifs. \nDepuis que ce changement et l’adoption du projet de loi C-218, un nombre croissant de paris sportifs ont ouvert leurs portes dans la province et ont vu un nombre incroyable d’inscriptions et de joueurs actifs dans la province. Puisque l’Ontario a prouvé que le nouveau système fonctionne, et que l’Ontario est un marché viable, les tendances vont continuer à augmenter au fur et à mesure que d’autres paris sportifs commenceront à entrer sur le marché. Puisque les provinces ont maintenant le choix de choisir comment réglementer les paris sportifs à leurs provinces, et aussi avec le succès de l’Ontario, les prochains pas seront que d’autres provinces comme le Québec, l’Alberta, la Colombie-Britannique et le Manitoba à suivre les pas de l’Ontario et à ouvrir ses portes à l’expansion des paris sportifs en ligne. Il y a aussi des lignes directrices dans chaque province, il y a des provinces qui peuvent faire des paris sportifs dès l’âge de 18 et il y en a d’autres que ses 19.\nLa situation pour les paris sportifs au Canada peut être résumée par ceci, les paris sportifs sont proposés par des sociétés de loterie qui se font de la publicité à un grand nombre de points de vente et font beaucoup de publicité à la télévision, à la radio et dans la presse écrite. L’évolution des paris sportifs au Canada est en train de subir des changements et va continuer de subir des changements. Les paris sportifs deviennent de plus en plus populaires ainsi que de plus en plus profitables qui veulent dire que le marché va seulement continuer à grandir. Puisque l’organisation se passe à un niveau provincial, il y aura des droits et libertés à certaines provinces qu’il n’y aura pas dans les autres. L’évolution va être une qui est différente pour chaque province, mais elle va être une qui est rapide et certaine. L’évolution de n’importe quoi comporte des avantages, mais aussi des conséquences, certainement quand cette évolution se passe si vite. L’évolution des paris sportifs au Canada va certainement prouver des problèmes, mais aussi des avantages pour chaque province et sa population de joueurs de paris sportifs.\n \nLes possibilités et conséquences dans le futur pour les paris sportifs au Canada\nPour commencer, nous avons vu l’évolution des paris sportifs, il est maintenant le temps d’évaluer les possibilités avantageuses, mais aussi les conséquences dans le futur pour les paris sportifs au Canada et ses joueurs. Pour cette portion de l’article, il faut rester neutre et il n’est pas acceptable de prendre un côté ou l’autre donc une position neutre est essentielle. Avec les paris sportifs qui sont devenus beaucoup plus accessibles au public canadien, il emporte de grandes possibilités pour le Canada qui auront autrement manqué, mais aussi de grandes conséquences qui auront dû être évitées.\nEn premier, les possibilités aussi connues comme les avantages sont présentes en discutant de l’économie canadienne et comment les paris sportifs ont un effet. Depuis la légalisation des paris sportifs au Canada, il y a un grand marché important qui se déverse maintenant dans cette économie canadienne. Il y a des billions de dollars qui sont mis dans le Canada et ses provinces qui auront autrement à être dispensées dans plusieurs autres lieux et pays. Un autre aspect positif pourrait être le fait que les personnes et les citoyens devraient avoir le droit d’être libres avec ses choix et ses propres finances, les personnes devraient avoir l’occasion de jouer avec leur argent pour en fait avoir la chance de gagner de l’argent. Un autre aspect positif est donc le fait que les paris sportifs et l’industrie des jeux au Canada a emporté plus de 182 000 emplois au Canada. \nMaintenant, passons aux conséquences qui sont entrainées par la légalisation des paris sportifs au Canada. En premier, la plupart des statistiques nous démontrent que la plupart des participants sont des hommes, ce qui démontre un public visé. Aussi, la légalisation des paris sportifs fait en sorte que faire des paris sportifs est devenu beaucoup plus accessible, avec ceci il y a une chance plus élevée d’entrainer des problèmes de dépendance. Il est possible de faire des paris sportifs à n’importe quel temps à n’importe quel endroit à cause des sites en ligne, ce qui fait que l’option pour faire des paris sportifs est toujours présente, il ne faut pas se rendre au casino ou rien comme ceci, il faut juste aller sur le téléphone. Nous pouvons voir un changement et une augmentation dans les paris sportifs placés chaque année à l’aide de Statistique Canada. En plus, les paris sportifs donnent aussi une chance plus élevée d’entrainer des dommages financiers.\nLes deux problèmes mentionnés en haut peuvent enfin causer des problèmes psychologiques et aussi comme n’importe quel type de jeu d’argent peuvent causer des problèmes dans la vie des participants qui ne sont pas faciles à résoudre ou à s’éloigner. Enfin, une dernière conséquence de la légalisation des paris sportifs au Canada est le fait que, de nos jours, les paris sportifs et les sites et compagnies de paris sportifs font beaucoup d’annonces publicitaires. Les compagnies font des endossements de plusieurs athlètes professionnels pour promouvoir les paris sportifs. \nTout ceci va entrainer des personnes à jouer des paris sportifs qui n’auront jamais. Aussi, les bandes d’annonces pourront aussi affecter l'âge que les personnes commencent à faire les paris sportifs. Mais, sur l’autre côté, la liberté est essentielle, les sentiments envers les paris sportifs peuvent aller des deux côtés. Comme n’importe quoi dans le monde il y a deux côtés sur la même pièce et tous affaires dans le monde ont des avantages mais aussi des conséquences.\n\n\n== références ==",

        "content": "Juan Pedro Baigorri Velar (1891, Concepción del Uruguay - 24 March 1972, Buenos Aires) was an Argentine engineer; known for his claims that he had invented a rain-making machine.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis father was a military officer. Raised in Buenos Aires, he studied at the Colegio Nacional. Later, he travelled to Italy, where he attended the University of Milan and received a degree in engineering, with a specialty in geophysics. He worked for several fuel companies, which involved trips to numerous countries, investigating soil composition and exploring for oil. During the course of these trips he made his own instruments, for detecting minerals and electromagnetism.\nIn 1929, he was invited by Enrique Mosconi to join the newly created YPF, a state-owned Argentine energy company. He had been working primarily from the United States but, at that time, he returned to Argentina and settled there permanently.\n\n\n== The Rain-Making Machine ==\nAccording to the magazine Crítica, its invention came about accidentally, when he was in Bolivia using his mineral detecting device. When it was connected, a light rain suddenly began to fall. He apparently concluded that was due to the \"electromagnetic congestion\" it produced. After that, he spent much of his time attempting to make it more effective. The final version was about the size of a 14\" TV set, with a battery and two antennas...one negative, one positive. It was presented at the offices of the Central Argentine Railway, for publicity purposes.\nThe company manager proposed that he make it rain in Santiago del Estero Province, which was going through one of the worst droughts in its history. In 1938, he travelled to Pinto with a representative of the company. According to witnesses, when the machine was turned on the wind changed direction, it became cloudy, and twelve hours later there was a brief downpour. He was encouraged to create a higher-power device and, later that year, took it to Santiago del Estero, the provincial capital. After fifty-five hours of being in operation, 2.5 inches of rain fell.\nUpon returning to Buenos Aires, he was interviewed by several newspapers and magazines, local and foreign. He also received criticism from Alfredo Galmarini, head of the Meteorology Directorate, who called the machine a \"parody\" and didn't believe that Baigorri was serious. In response, he promised to make it rain in Buenos Aires in three days, activated the machine, and sent an umbrella to Galmarini. Clouds began to gather on the first night and, the following morning, there was a downpour. After claiming another successful demonstration in Carhué, he returned to his regular career, saying that he was tired of the publicity.\nIn 1951 Raúl Mendé, the Minister of Technical Affairs, asked him to put his machine back into use. The following year, he claimed to have caused rain in Caucete, where there had supposedly been a drought for eight years. In 1953, he made a similar claim for La Pampa Province. Eventually, interest in him and his device waned, and he went into seclusion. He had never revealed exactly how his device worked, and suggested that only he could put it into operation properly. He was gradually forgotten.\nHis refusal to patent his machine led to suspicions that it was a fraud. Eduardo Piacentini, of the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, declared that Baigorri's machine might be able to predict rain, but not cause it. There was also the possibility that his work was affected by confirmation bias, whereby people would remember when it rained, but not when it had failed to. Nevertheless, similar experiments in other parts of the world, such as the United Arab Emirates, indicated that his basic theory might be correct.\nHe died in poverty and was buried at La Chacarita Cemetery.

        "content": "Frances Louise Lockridge (January 10, 1896 – February 17, 1963) was an American journalist and writer of detective fiction. With her husband, Richard Lockridge, she created one of the most famous American mystery series, Mr. and Mrs. North. Over her lifetime, the pair wrote 50 novels together.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFrances Louise Davis was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1896.\nShe attended the University of Kansas, though she did not graduate, and worked as a reporter and music critic at various publications including the Kansas City Journal-Post, Kansas City Kansan, and Kansas City Star. She met fellow reporter Richard Lockridge, whom she married in 1922, after which the couple moved to New York.\n\n\n== Mr. and Mrs. North series ==\nIn 1937, Frances Lockridge conceived the plot for a detective novel, but she had problems with her characters. She sought the collaboration of her husband, Richard, and they merged her plot with the characters he had created earlier for a series of comic sketches in The New Yorker, Mr. and Mrs. North. The book was published in 1940 as The Norths Meet Murder, launching a series of twenty-six novels, which was adapted for the stage, film, radio, and television.\n\n\n== Lt. Heimrich series ==\nIn the second Mr. and Mrs. North novel, Murder Out of Turn (1941), the couple and their New York City homicide detective friend, Lt. Bill Weigand, encounter murder out of town, near Brewster, New York. There they meet an officer of the New York State Bureau of Criminal Identification (referred to in some later books as the Bureau of Criminal Investigation), Lt. Heimrich (in later books given the first name Merton, and achieving promotion to captain). Heimrich also guest-starred in a 1946 Mr. and Mrs. North book, Death of a Tall Man, before becoming the star of his own series of twenty-two novels, beginning with Think of Death (1947). Richard continued the series after Frances' death in 1963, but she co-wrote the following novels:\n\n\n== Nathan Shapiro series ==\nFrances and Richard Lockridge began a third detective series with The Faceless Adversary (1956), featuring New York City Police detective, Nathan Shapiro. Shapiro was a sad-sack of a detective, who always assumed some other detective would be more skillful or more insightful. He always thinks that the promotions he receives are undeserved. People he encounters wonder what makes him appear to be so depressed. Eventually, the Shapiro series ran to ten books, with Richard continuing the series after Frances' death in 1963, but the couple worked together on:\n\n\n== Paul Lane series ==\nFrances and Richard Lockridge began a fourth detective series with Night of the Shadows (1962), a police procedural featuring a New York City Police detective, Paul Lane. Lane was the main character in Quest for the Bogeyman (1964), the last book that Frances contributed to, and then he and partner Sgt., then later Lt., John Stein, were prominently featured in the six novels focused on New York County assistant district attorney Bernard Simmons that followed that character's first appearance, in And Left for Dead (1961).\n\n\n== Other writing ==\nIn their collaborations, Frances would generally produce the plot of the novels, while Richard would flesh out the writing. \"We had story conferences, and wrote a summary. As we both insisted, the writing was entirely mine,\" Richard said in one interview. In 1962, the Chicago Tribune's Harry Hansen wrote, \"I asked the pair where they got their plots. Richard Lockridge pointed to his wife; she thinks up the complications, he puts them into prose.\" The Lockridges' books were all jointly bylined: their Mr. and Mrs. North books as \"Frances and Richard Lockridge\"; the Lt. Heimrich books as \"Richard and Frances Lockridge.\"\nOutside of their series, Frances and Richard Lockridge co-wrote the novels Catch As Catch Can (1951), The Innocent House (1958), The Golden Man (1960), and The Ticking Clock (1961). With her husband, Lockridge also wrote several short non-fiction books about cats, including Cats and People (1960).\nOn her own, Frances Lockridge wrote the 1928 book How to Adopt a Child; from 1922 to 1942 she worked for the adoption and placement committee of the State Aid Charities Association. She also for several years wrote the New York Times' \"Hundred Neediest\" column.\n\n\n== Personal and professional life ==\nIn 1960, Frances and Richard Lockridge served as co-presidents of the Mystery Writers of America. They received a special Edgar Award in 1962.\nFrances Lockridge died in 1963, in Connecticut, at age 67. Richard continued to write Lt. Heimrich, Nathan Shapiro, and Paul Lane novels, as well as non-series mystery novels, but he wrote no Mr. and Mrs. North novels after Frances' death.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "State of Nevada v. Michael J. McDonald, et al. is a state criminal prosecution concerning the Trump fake electors plot in Nevada. The six defendants are accused of offering a false instrument for file or record and uttering a forged instrument to falsely claim that Donald Trump won the state's electoral votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Nevada. Among the accused are Michael J. McDonald, the chair of the Nevada Republican Party, and Clark County Republican chairman Jesse Law.\nOn December 5, 2023, a grand jury issued the indictment. All six defendants pleaded not guilty; the case is set to go to trial on January 13, 2025. If convicted, they face between one and five years in prison.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, and carried the state of Nevada, defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in the popular vote by 33,596 votes, and gaining all of the state's six electoral votes. Trump and his allies, however, refused to accept the election results and launched an ultimately unsuccessful campaign to remain in power via subverting the election results.\nIn 2022, during the investigation of the U.S. House select committee on the January 6 attack, Nevada GOP chair Michael J. McDonald and Nevada GOP secretary James DeGraffenreid were both subpoenaed on January 28 and deposed on February 24.\nIn May 2023, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford testified that the fake electors would likely not be charged as he did not believe they had violated any specific law. However, in November 2023, it was reported that Ford was actively investigating individuals who had acted as fake electors.\n\n\n== Indictment ==\nOn December 5, 2023, a Nevada grand jury in the District Court for Clark County issued an indictment charging six Nevada Republicans. The indictment stems from the sending of a document falsely ascertaining that Trump had won the state.  Each of the six defendants was charged with two felony counts:\n\nOffering false instrument for file or record: Defendants \"knowingly procured\" and offered a false instrument to be \"filed, registered, or recorded in a public office\"\nUttering forged instruments: Defendants, with intent to \"defraud, uttered, offered, and disposed\", falsely put off an instrument as true\nNevada was the third state to bring charges in the fake elector scheme, after Georgia and Michigan. Arizona later became the fourth state to bring charges.\n\n\n=== Defendants ===\nMichael J. McDonald, Nevada Republican Party chairman\nJames DeGraffenreid, Nevada Republican national committeeman\nJesse Law, Clark County Republican Party chairman\nJames Hindle III, Storey County clerk\nShawn Meehan, Nevada Republican who acted as Chairman of the Resolutions\nEileen Rice, Nevada Republican elector\n\n\n== Pre-trial proceedings ==\nThe six defendants were arraigned on December 16, 2023; all pleaded not guilty. Judge Mary Kay Holthus set the trial for March 11, 2024. This was later moved to January 13, 2025.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndictment",

        "content": "Fulgidea is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Umbilicariaceae. It has two species of squamulose lichens that grow on bark and on wood.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2013 by the Norwegian lichenologists Mika Bendiksby and Einar Timdal. They assigned Fulgidea oligospora as the type species. The genus name Fulgidea is derived from the Latin word fulgur, meaning \"lightning\", alluding to its preference for growing on burnt wood. The name also reflects its morphological similarities to species within the genus Lecidea. Both species of Fulgidea had previously been classified in the genus Hypocenomyce.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGenus Fulgidea is characterized by its squamulose thallus, which is closely attached or slightly raised and oriented against gravity. The thallus ranges in color from greyish-green to dark brown and can have either a dull or shiny appearance. It lacks a pruinose coating (a fine powdery surface layer that sometimes appears frosted) and does not have a hypothallus, which is an underlying layer of hyphae that can sometimes be visible at the lichen's periphery.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies) of Fulgidea are black, flat, and maintain a distinct margin. They lack a pruinose covering. The exciple, which is the tissue surrounding the apothecium, is made up of tightly bonded, relatively thin-walled hyphae that are ellipsoid to shortly cylindrical in shape. The inner parts and rim of the exciple are blackish brown, and the pigment partially dissolves in potassium hydroxide solution (K) resulting in a brown coloration, but does not react to nitrogen tests (N−). The epihymenium—the uppermost layer of cells in the apothecium—is brown and contains amorphous substances that also dissolve to release a brown effusion when treated with K.\nThe ascus (spore-bearing structure) is narrowly rhombic with an amyloid cap at the tip. The amyloid reaction is a staining reaction used to identify certain chemical properties of lichen tissues. The cap includes a small, amyloid tholus—a structure within the ascus tip—with a non-amyloid central plug. Pycnidia, which are asexual reproductive structures, have brown walls. The pycnoconidia (asexual spores), are rod-shaped, measuring 7–10 μm in length and about 1 μm in width.\nChemically, Fulgidea species contain alectorialic and thamnolic acids, which are secondary metabolites (lichen products) specific to certain lichens and contribute to their biochemical characteristics.\n\n\n== Comparison to similar genera ==\nThe genus Fulgidea is primarily distinguished from Hypocenomyce by its exciple structure. In Hypocenomyce, the exciple is colorless internally and green at the rim (K−, N+ violet), and is only partially conglutinated with hyphae separated by lecanoric acid crystals (C+ red). Additionally, Hypocenomyce features a green epihymenium and pycnidium wall that react positively to violet staining with N and contains lecanoric acid, unlike Fulgidea which lacks amorphous substances. The pycnoconidia in Hypocenomyce are generally longer, ranging from bacilliform to filiform in shape.\nContrasting with Pycnora, Fulgidea has an ascus that is narrowly rhombic with an amyloid cap and a small amyloid tholus with a non-amyloid central plug, whereas Pycnora has a broadly clavate (club-shaped) ascus without an amyloid cap but with a well-developed, amyloid tholus and a deeper amyloid area along the wall. Additionally, Pycnora has a strictly crustose thallus and a green epihymenium that turns violet with N and dissolves in K, with shorter pycnoconidia that are more or less spherical to shortly bacilliform. Elixia, another genus, differs from Fulgidea as it forms a crustose or endoxylic thallus, with star-shaped to lirelloid apothecia, capitate paraphyses with a distinct pigment zone at the top of the apical cell, and lacks secondary compounds. Xylopsora, another genus in the Umbilicariaceae, is morphologically, anatomically and ecologically similar to Fulgidea and differs mainly in secondary chemistry: it contains friesiic acid rather than alectorialic and thamnolic acids.\n\n\n== Species ==\nFulgidea oligospora (Timdal) Bendiksby & Timdal (2013) – Arizona, USA; Sakha Republic, Russia\nFulgidea sierrae (Timdal) Bendiksby & Timdal (2013) – California, USA\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Imajuku Kofun Cluster (今宿古墳群, Imajuku Kofun-gun)  is a group Kofun period burial mounds, located in Nishi-ku, Fukuoka Japan. Three of the burial mounds were designated individually as National Historic Sites of Japan in 1928. In 2004, these three tumuli were consolidated with four additional tumuli and the name was changed to the \"Imajuku Kofun Cluster\". \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Imajuku Kofun Cluster consists of more than 350 tumuli in an area extending three kilometers east-to-west and 1.5 kilometers north-to-south in the Imajuku Plain on the west side of Hakata Bay and the hills behind it in western Fukuoka City. These include 11 zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. The keyhole-shaped tumuli are known to have been constructed over a period of approximately 150 years from the mid-4th century to the early 6th century, including three that are known to have existed, but have now disappeared. Cases in which keyhole-shaped tumuli were continuously constructed throughout the Kofun period in the same region are rare nationwide.  The three tumuli which were covered in the initial 1928 National Historic Site designation are:\n\nSukizaki Kofun (鋤崎古墳) located at the eastern end of the group, the Sukizaki Kofun is believed to have been constructed in the latter half of the 4th century. It is 62 meters long, seven meters high, and built in three stages. There is a horizontal-entry cave-style stone burial chamber which contained three clay coffins, and one small stone coffin. It was excavated] from 1981 to 1983. Grave goods included five bronze mirrors. 240 beads, two iron swords, six iron daggers, two iron halberds, 14 iron tools, five needles and Haji ware pottery. Haniwa found on the mound included cylindrical, morning glory-shaped, pot-shaped, and various figurative haniwa.\nMarusumiyama Kofun (丸隈山古墳) is the largest in the cluster, with a total length of 84.6 meters. The posterior circular portion has a diameter of 60 meters, and the width of the anterior rectangular portion is 25 meters. It is estimated to date from the  first half of the 5th century. The horizontal-entry stone burial chamber made of basalt and the sarcophagus inside is open to the public. It was opened in the Edo period, and records state that bronze mirrors, iron swords, iron arrowheads, and other items were found inside, including Tomoe-shaped bronze vessels, magatama beads, and cylindrical beads.\nImajuku Otsuka Kofun (今宿大塚古墳) has a length of 64 meters. It is surrounded by a shield-shaped moat 8 to 12 meters wide, with an outer embankment. It is located on a low plateau at the northern foot of Mt. Koso, orientated to the west. It dates from the first half of the 6th century. Cylindrical, warrior and horse-shaped haniwa have been found in the outer embankment, along with Sue ware pottery. The burial chamber remains unexcavated.\nThe four tumuli additionally designated in 2004 are:\n\nWakahachimangū  Kofun (若八幡宮古墳) is located on the south side of the Imajuku Bypass within the grounds of a Shinto shrine. It is approximately in the center of the group.  It was built on a hill at an altitude of 29 meters derived from the Mt. Koso massif, and is orientated to the north. The tumulus has a length of 47 meters, with a 25-meter diameter circular portion and was constructed in three stages at the rear and two stages at the front. The mound is covered with fukiishi. The burial chamber contained a hollow boat-shaped wooden coffin (made of cedar) with a length of 2.75 meters and a width of 1.2 meters, placed perpendicular to the long axis of the tumulus. Grave good included a triangular-rimmed bronze mirror of two gods and two beasts, an iron ring-headed sword, iron dagger, iron arrowheads, and beads. It also included rectangular plate leather-bound short armor, which is one of the oldest in Japan. Based on these grave goods, it is thought to have been constructed in the latter half of the 4th century, and is thus one of the oldest in the cluster.\nYamanohana No. 1 Kofun (山ノ鼻一号墳), is the oldest of the group and is believed to have been built in the mid-4th century. It is located  on a hill northeast of Wakahachimangu Kofun, across from the Imajuku Bypass. The tumulus has been mostly destroyed, but excavations confirm that its original length was 44 meters, with a 27 meter diameter circular portion, and 20 meter wide rectangular portion.It was found that the rear round part was built in three tiers and the front part in two tiers, and the mound was covered with fukiishi. No haniwa were found. Most of the burial chamber had been destroyed, but fragments of bronze mirrors and Haji ware potter have been unearthed.\nKabutozuka Kofun (兜塚古墳) is located at the tip of a hill extending from Mt. Koso on the west side of the group. It was initially thought to be a circular tumulus, but excavations in 1994, 1995 and 2003 revealed that it was a zenpō-kōen-fun with an original length of over 53 meters, with a 43-meter diameter circular portion and height of six meters. It was constructed in two stages, and each slope covered with fukiishi and haniwa. The burial chamber had been robbed in the Edo period, but it appears that it had been used for multiple burials. Remaining grave goods recovered included glass beads,  weapons such as armor, iron arrowheads and swords, and horse equipment. It was built in the latter half of the 5th century.\nIiji Futatsuka Kofun (飯氏二塚古墳) is located on a hill with an elevation of 30-35 meters,  that extends to the eastern edge of the Itoshima Plain. It was excavated in 1993 and 2002 and determined to have a length of 49.6 meters with a diameter of 27.3 meters at the rear circle, a width of 36.9 meters at the front, and a height of five meters. There was no trace of haniwa or a moat. The burial chamber is perpendicular to the long axis of the mound, but was in very poor condition. It appears that there were at least two burials and from fragments of beads, horse fittings and Sue ware pottery, it  is believed that it was constructed in the early 6th century.\nThe Marukumayama Kofun is about a 15-minute walk from Susenji Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line. The Imajuku Otsuka Kofun is about a 15-minute walk from Imajuku Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties of Fukuoka City (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web (in Japanese)",

        "content": "The 2024 Heart of America 200 was the 8th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and the 24th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas, a 1.5 miles (2.4 km) permanent asphalt quad-oval shaped intermediate speedway. The race took the scheduled 134 laps to complete. Corey Heim, driving for Tricon Garage, would cruise to a dominating victory, winning the first stage and leading a race-high 79 laps, eventually holding off a charging Zane Smith in the final few laps to earn his seventh career NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series win, and his second of the season. To fill out the podium, Christian Eckes, driving for McAnally-Hilgemann Racing, would finish 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nKansas Speedway is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) tri-oval race track in Kansas City, Kansas. It was built in 2001 and hosts two annual NASCAR race weekends. The NTT IndyCar Series also raced there until 2011. The speedway is owned and operated by the International Speedway Corporation.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice was held on Saturday, May 4, at 11:05 AM CST, and would last for 20 minutes. Ty Majeski, driving for ThorSport Racing, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 30.895, and a speed of 174.786 mph (281.291 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Saturday, May 4, at 11:35 AM CST. Since Kansas Speedway is an intermediate speedway, the qualifying system used is a single-car, one-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have one lap to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nChase Purdy, driving for Spire Motorsports, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 30.728, and a speed of 175.735 mph (282.818 km/h).\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 30\n\nStage 2 Laps: 30\n\nStage 3 Laps: 74\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jack-in-the-Box is a 1944 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington. It is the sixteenth in his series of novels featuring the Golden Age Detective  Sir Clinton Driffield, the Chief Constable of a rural English county. It was published by Hodder and Stoughton in London and Little, Brown and Company in the United States. Writing in The New York Times Isaac Anderson felt that \"to appreciate this story fully one should either be well grounded in science or take Sir Clinton’s explanations on trust\".\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 1942, at the height of the Second World War, German bombs are raining down on Ambledown to try and knock out a munitions factory. One bomb lands some way outside the town, causing a large crater close to the location of a former Roman camp. Recent archaeological research has unearthed an ancient hoard on a patch of land earmarked for potential development for the expanding town. Soon afterwards the archaeologist leading the excavation is killed in an air raid.\nHowever doubts remain about the case and the possibility of murder arises. The land set aside for redevelopment is owned in trust for the grandchildren of an earlier developer of the town. One by one they begin to die off in inexplicable circumstances. Yet the potential profits of any land sales still seem a poor motive even for the dwindling number of heirs. It is only when Sir Clinton realises that the air strike has unearthed the potentially lucrative presence of vast deposits of tin (now in short supply due to the loss of Malaya to Japanese forces) that the reason for the killings makes sense. Matters are complicated by one of the beneficiaries, a Liberian confidence trickster who claims to have occult powers that Sir Clinton is ultimately able to debunk.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

        "content": "Robert Walsingham (died in or after 1313) was a Carmelite scholastic theologian and philosopher.\nWalsingham was a student of one William Paganerus at the University of Oxford around 1280 or 1290. In 1303, he supported the English provincial master William Lidlyngton against the decisions of the Carmelite general chapter meeting in Narbonne to divide the English province. He was supposedly already an old man by 1305. He obtained his master's degree sometime thereafter but before 12 February 1312, when he and Henry of Harclay held disputations.\nTwo quodlibeta by Walsingham are known from a single manuscript. The longer is said to contain 22 questions, although only 19 are present. The other contains six questions. There was once a larger collection, Quodlibeta maiora, cited by John Bale, but it is now lost. The surviving quodlibeta are usually dated to 1312–1313. They \"are among the earliest scholastic works where the author cites his contemporaries.\" Among these \"moderns\", as he calls them, are Henry Harclay, Godfrey of Fontaines, Peter of Auvergne, Thomas Aquinas, Alexander of Hales, Gerard of Bologna, Henry of Ghent, Giles of Rome, John Duns Scotus, Simon of Faversham, Robert Cowton and Richard of Conington. He had an especially high opinion of Henry of Ghent, whom he calls \"the great\". Among older authorities, he cites Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes.\nWalsingham was not a very influential thinker. Besides his quodlibeta, only excerpts from his Quaestiones ordinariae and Elucidationes sententiarum Petri Lombardi, a commentary on the Sentences, and preserved in two manuscripts. His Determinationes scripturae and his commentaries on Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus are apparently lost. Nevertheless, he influenced Robert Graystanes and John Baconthorpe calls him \"my reverend master\". His quodlibeta are cited by Johannes Brammart.\nThe figure of John Walsingham, first cited by Johannes Trithemius in 1531 and then by many others, results from a conflation of Robert Walsingham with John Baconthorpe and John Walsham. This fictional John was said to have become Carmelite provincial master of England in 1326. The confusion was dismantled by Bartomeu Xiberta in 1931.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Walsingham, Robert\" in the Dictionnaire de théologie catholique",

        "content": "Granatiere (\"Grenadier\") was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\"). Commissioned in 1907, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1927.\n\n\n== Design ==\nGranatiere was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). Originally, she had a fuel capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons) of coal, giving her a range of 1,500 nautical miles (2,800 km; 1,700 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and 400 nautical miles (740 km; 460 mi) at 23.5 knots (43.5 km/h; 27.0 mph); she later was converted to burn fuel oil, with a fuel capacity of 65 tonnes (64 long tons) of oil. She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nGranatiere was laid down on 24 July 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 27 October 1906 and completed on 18 April 1907. She was commissioned on 5 June 1907.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== 1907–1911 ===\nAssigned to the 3rd Destroyer Squadron in the Department of the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea, Granatiere spent an initial training period in the waters of La Spezia. On 13 May 1908, she steamed up the Tiber to Rome to receive a battle flag presented to her by the Italian Royal Army's Brigade \"Granatieri di Sardegna\" at the Port of Ripa Grande in the presence of King Victor Emmanuel III.\nA devastating earthquake in the Strait of Messina and subsequent tsunami struck Messina, Sicily, and Reggio Calabria on the Italian mainland on 28 December 1908. On 1 January 1909 Granatiere and the auxiliary ship Volta arrived at Messina to assist in rescue operations. In 1909 she operated in the Middle East to defend Italians from anti-Christian violence.\nIn 1910, Granatiere visited Monaco to attend the dedication of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. During 1910 she also escorted the Italian royal yacht Trinacria to Sicily and Sardinia.\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Granatiere was part of the 2nd Squadron's 4th Destroyer Division along with her sister ships Bersagliere, Garibaldino, and Lanciere. She supported Italian operations off Ottoman Libya and in the Red Sea in 1911, and in 1912 operated in the Red Sea, in the Aegean Sea off Anatolia and Greece, and in the Dodecanese. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914 — a year in which Granatiere underwent repairs at the Taranto Arsenal — and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Granatiere, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Landi, was part of the 2nd Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto, which also included the destroyers Impavido, Insidioso, and Irrequieto. During the war she escorted convoys across the Adriatic Sea from Italy to the Principality of Albania and served on antisubmarine duty in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea and southern Adriatic, escorting ships on routes between Gibraltar, Marseille, Malta, and Sicily. On 1 December 1917 she recovered 160 survivors of the auxiliary cruiser Città di Sassari, torpedoed and sunk in the Gulf of Genoa off Borghetto Santo Spirito, Italy, at 44°08′N 008°14′E by the Imperial German Navy submarine U-65.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter World War I, Granatiere was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. Between 1921 and 1924 she was deployed in the Italian Dodecanese, stationed at Rhodes as the flagship of the local senior naval commander. She then served as a training ship at the Mechanics School of Venice from 1925 to 1927.\nGranatiere was stricken from the naval register on 3 November 1927. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W. H. (1913).

        "content": "Alfredo Gil Porta (10 January 1891 – 27  January 1908) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for FC Barcelona between 1905 and 1908.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGil was born on 10 January 1891 in Carrer de Sant Pau in Barcelona, as the son of Josep Gil i Pradas, born in Figueroles, and Teresa Porta i Prim, born in Vila-rodona.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nGil joined the football team of FC Barcelona from the athletics section, being an outstanding athlete in endurance tests since he had obtained several first prizes in races, including one on 23 August 1906, at the age of 15, he won a race of 2.500 meters, finishing ahead of second-placed Miguel Puig and Antonio Tenliado.\nIn total, Gil played 12 matches for FC Barcelona and scored two goals, his side's only goal in a 1–0 victory over X Sporting Club on 6 May 1906, and his side's only goal in a 1–4 loss to FC Internacional two weeks later, on 20 May 1906. However, both of them were friendly matches; officially, Gil only played three games, all of which in the Catalan championship.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nGil died in Barcelona on 27 January 1908, at the tender age of just 17, due to an illness. At the time, Gil was still a player at Barça, where he almost occupied a place in the first team of the club, since he was its first substitute, distinguishing himself for his security on the left side, with his fellow forwards.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Preferred Communications Inc v City of Los Angeles was a case filed in United States District Court. for the Central District of California in 1983  (#83-5846 cbm).   The complaint was made by Preferred Communications Inc., a California Corporation formed at the dawn off Cable Television Industry. Judge Consuelo Marshall, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, heard the case which she subsequently dismissed. Ultimately, Marshall's ruling was found to be unconstitutional.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the month of December, 1979, while the cable television industry was at its infant stages, cable television franchise opportunities had recently been made available in South Central Los Angeles contemporarily known as South Los Angeles or South L.A.\nPreferred Communications Inc was the successor of Universal Cable Systems Ltd. (c.1982) and was established with the aim of securing a Franchise from the city of Los Angeles and providing Cable Television services and community-generated content and programming for the South Central Los Angeles (now \"South L.A.\", or \"South Los Angeles\" area.\nUnder the administration of Mayor Tom Bradley, the City of Los Angeles would systemically obstruct and violate the constitution and the rights it conferred upon all Citizens of the United States.\nIn 1983, Preferred Communications Inc. filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles alleging that the franchising process was a tool used and conceived in bad faith by City officials who would reject all bids apart from the one put forth by \"friends of the administration.\"\nThe complaint filed by plaintiff Preferred Communications Inc., (preferred) in addition to the Supreme Court ruling were a condemnation of the city's elected officials who sought to secure deals for and/or benefits to themselves.\n\n\n== Precursor to Complaint ==\nDuring its development (according to a rationale that has by no means become more clear with time) the Cable Television Industry and its development were placed under the prevue of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (DOT) Under the direction of Mayor Tom Bradley, the L.A. DOT would deny Preferred Communications Inc. the requisite if not arbitrary cable franchise license in a controversial bidding process overseen by the L.A. City Council.\nFounded solely upon the specious rationale of 'Natural Monopoly' the L.A. DOT held that Cable Television (on account of the purported constraints inherent to the literal cables used for its transmission ) is inherently constrained; moreover that such purported constraint existed to a degree requiring the core principles of Capitalism to be thrown out where Cable Television (and competition) were concerned. Unfortunately, the competitive bidding process was not competitive, nor did it merely fail to be; rather, what was described as a competitive process comprised an elaborate mechanism to prevent competition, constituting, therefore, either 1) a farce or 2) a crime. By the very metrics they had established, the Los Angeles DOT awarded the \"winning bid\" to the loser.\n\n\n== Legal Proceedings ==\nIn 1983, Preferred Communications Inc. filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles. The allegations held in the complaint included the assertion that the city, under the administration of Mayor Tom Bradley, had committed a violation of their First amendment rights under the Constitution of the United States of America. In 1986 the allegations of Civil Rights violations became legal fact as these were validated and upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. After a near decade of delays, having been reversed in two courts by twelve judges and Justices (3 and 9 respectively) presiding judge, Consuelo Marshall, would award Plaintiffs one U.S. Dollar for the deprivation and violation of their 1st Amendment, Civil, rights.\nStatistically speaking the unanimous agreement among the twelve federal judges and justices who reversed Judge Marshal and held that Los Angeles City officials were in breach of U.S. constitutional law, constitutes a rare event. Qualitatively, their ruling was an indictment on Judge Marshall's conduct (and predicate rationale) pursuant the matter as well as her civil servant counterparts at the City level who swore an oath not dissimilar to her own: to act without fear or favor, of or for, any private person or party. The ruling may be seen in hindsight, though by few it was seen then, as a harbinger for the world to come pertaining to the relationship between government officials as gatekeepers and their \"barbarian\" ( counterparts whose money and influence granted them entrance into the gates of the minds of all United States Citizens.\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and later the U.S. Supreme Court found that the City of Los Angeles \"violated the First Amendment through its procedure relative to the South Central Los Angeles Cable Television Franchise\" specifically by depriving Preferred Communications Inc, access to the public utility lines.\n\n\n== Judicial Reversal and National Precedent ==\nPresiding Judge for the Central District of California Consuelo Marshall dismissed the original complaint citing vague if not contradictory logic. Marshall's ruling was subsequently and unanimously overruled in two higher Courts.\n\nIn sum, twelve senior members of the bench superseded Marshall's decree. First to reverse Marshall was a three judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals who summarized:\"...[w]e affirm the district court's decision insofar as it pertains to the plaintiff's antitrust claims and reverse its dismissal of the First Amendment claim,\"and subsequently, the Supreme Court of the United States of America whereupon all nine Justices \"dismissed as improper\"  Marshall's ruling, stating:\"...[t]he complaint should not have been dismissed. The activities in which respondent allegedly seeks to engage plainly implicate First Amendment interests.\"While it was the opinion of Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that: \"the [City of Los Angeles] was obligated to allow [Preferred Communications Inc.] use of its physical capacity to further speech,\" the Plaintiff(s) were deprived a jury trial to determine damages for roughly a decade. Between 1983 and 1992, legal hardship and economic disenfranchisement were the product of continual delays; further, no public hearing was ever granted to plaintiff(s) in their effort to assert their first amendment rights under the U.S. constitution.\nMultiple delays permeate the timeline of events despite the High Court's ruling.\n\nIn 1983 the case was filed in District Court. for the Central District of California.  (#83-5846 cbm)\nIn 1985 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Marshall's decision.(#754 f 2d)\nIn 1986 the Supreme Court rendered unanimous judgment (9–0), to reverse Marshall and upheld the 9th Circuit's 3-0 ruling (#476 U.S. 488, 1986)\nIn 1992 Judge Marshall would issue her final ruling in defiance of the mandate issued by two higher courts having deferred the case in sum for five years subsequent to the Supreme Court decision.\nWhile twelve senior judges and Justices from two higher courts stated clearly their unanimous and binding legal opinions that Marshall's determinations were in conflict with the Constitution of the United States,  Marshall's final ruling was to award Plaintiffs one U.S. Dollar for having suffered a violation of their Civil Rights and for having been deprived access to both the free market and freedom of speech.\nThe precedent established by the Supreme Court would shape the Cable Television industry and subsequently the internet as it is known and accessed at present and in the years to come. Equally profound, though for contrary reasons, is Judge Marshall's decision to defy the Supreme Court ruling in spirit of not according to the letter.  By Marshall's reasoning, the 1st Amendment protections afforded American Citizens is equal to $1 American Dollar.\nAs Marshall alone determined the amount of damages to be awarded plaintiffs, her honor's determination implicates or asserts that the First Amendment protections afforded all U.S. Citizens may be nullified for one U.S. dollar. As a matter of jurisprudence, Marshall's final ruling seems to diminish the judgement(s) of the U.S. Supreme Court to the realm of mere suggestion.\n\nAs discreetly made available on Justia Law, and read in Memorandum, the Circuit Judge of record states: \"Preferred not only won[...]; it prevailed on the central issue of the case: The one area/one operator policy was found unconstitutional by the district court, a judgment we affirm today[...]. Though Preferred was not actually awarded a franchise, it has secured the right to compete for one. That's a significant victory, one which has altered the legal relationship between Preferred and the city. \" \n\n\n== References ==",

Since its independence from the United Kingdom as Bechuanaland on September 30, 1966, Botswana has been a parliamentary republic with a dominant party, namely the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), previously called the Bechuanaland Democratic Party. The first president to govern Botswana was Sir Seretse Khama. The country has had 13 formal general elections since 1961, with one happening every five years. The 2024 election is expected to happen in October. Each president is entitled to two five-year terms; Quett Masire, the second president, created Botswana’s term limit in 1997. The country first adopted universal franchise during the 1965 Bechuanaland general election.\nEvery election has been won by the BDP. However, recent elections have shown that support for the BDP is declining, and opposition parties have started getting more support. Opinion polls in 2022 conducted by Afrobarometer showed that 29.4% of people surveyed would vote for a main opposition party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), if elections were held the next day, compared to the BDP’s 22.3%, showing signs of instability towards Botswana’s dominant party system.\nThe president of Botswana is selected after the general election. For this process, the presidential candidate from the political party that wins a majority of the seats is sworn in as president.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe table below excludes European Advisory Council elections as members were elected by European residents, not citizens of the Protectorate themselves,\nand Bechuanaland citizens also did not get to participate in the British Administration.\n\n\tElectoral maps of Botswana general elections\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Best of Greg Egan is a collection of science fiction stories  by Australian writer Greg Egan, published by Subterranean Press in 2019.\nThe collection contains 20 stories which were published in a variety of original publications. It is also accompanied by an Afterword from the author.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting in Locus Magazine reviewer Russell Letson noted Egan's statement in his Afterword that the stories here \"the struggle to come to terms with what it will mean when our growing ability to scrutinize and manipulate the physical world reaches the point where it encompasses the substrate underlying our values, our memories, and our identities.\" Letson then went on to say: \"Of course, there is more to Egan's thematic universe – notably in his far-future and virtual-environments settings – and there are recurring figures and motifs that run across the whole range of his work: refugees, exiles, outsiders and outliers, unpersons, relentless investigators and explorers and explainers-of-phenomena, inventors and devisers of understandings. Most of these stories do indeed emphasize his examinations of how we experience ourselves – our understandings, our feelings, our motives, our sense of who-we-are and what-we-mean and what-we-value.\" Concluding: \"Egan is determined to make sense of everything – to understand the whole world as an intelligible, rational, material (and finally manipulable) realm – even if it means abandoning comfortable and comforting illusions. This is fundamental to the whole project of SF and it's why Egan's Best – and his Rest – is worth any number of looks.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n2019 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On September 28, 2023, rebels from the CSP-PSD attacked Malian bases in Dioura, Mali.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the start of 2023, tensions had intensified between the Malian junta that took power in 2021 and the allied Wagner Group mercenaries against the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD), a coalition of the former rebel Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) and the pro-government Platform militias. Malian and Wagner forces attacked the town of Ber in August 2023, the first major clashes between the two groups since the signing of the Algiers Accords in 2015. CSP-PSD spokesmen denounced the attack, and stated that retaliation would occur. The CSP-PSD then declared war on the Malian junta, and attacked Malian forces in Bourem and Léré. \n\n\n== Attack ==\nCSP-PSD forces attacked the camp at Dioura on the evening of September 28. The CSP-PSD and CMA claimed that they had seized control of the camp at Dioura after two hours of fighting, and withdrew from the area around midnight after seizing lots of ammunition, weaponry, and equipment. French media Le Monde and RFI confirmed the CSP-PSD's seizure of the camp at Dioura.\nThe Malian Army reported during the evening of September 28 that there was a \"complex terrorist attack\", \"kamikaze\" in nature, on the camp in Dioura, but did not give any further details. The army also claimed to have sent reinforcements and destroyed a column of the attackers' vehicles, which the CSP-PSD denied.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Malian Army did not publish any information regarding the outcome of the attack at Dioura. The CSP-PSD published two conflicting press releases on September 30; CSP-PSD spokesman Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane announced that ninety-eight Malian soldiers were killed in the attack, dozens were injured, and five soldiers were taken prisoner and released shortly afterward. A second report published by Colonel Moulay Ag Sidi Mola announced a toll of eighty-one Malian soldiers killed, five prisoners, five vehicles captured, and fifteen other vehicles destroyed. Sidi Mola stated five CSP-PSD fighters were killed and ten others were injured.\n\n\n== References ==",

Kim Sŏm-han was a descendant of Kim Al-chi, the progenitor of the ruling House of Kim of the Silla kingdom. \nThe clan rose to prominence during the Joseon dynasty, and was considered a powerful gentry family between the reigns of King Seongjong until the reign of King Injo. The most influential individual from the Yonan Kim clan during this period was Kim An-ro, who rose to the position of Left State Councillor during the reign of King Jungjong and married his one of his sons to the king's daughter. Another member was Queen Inmok, the consort of King Seonjo of Joseon. She was later deposed as the queen dowager by her step-son, Gwanghaegun, before being reinstated by his successor, Injo. \nThe 2015 South Korean census recorded 93,382 individuals who were members of the Yonan Kim clan.\n\n\n== Members ==\nKim An-ro (1481 – 1537), Joseon scholar-official\nQueen Inmok (1584 – 1632), Queen-consort of King Seonjo of Joseon\nKim Chung-up (1922 – 1988), South Korean architect\nKim Deok-ju (1933 – 2023), South Korean justice, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Korea (1990 – 1993)\nKim Sung-joo (born 1964), South Korean politician, former member of the National Assembly\n\n\n== See also ==\nKim (Korean surname)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Chemical Park of Promotion and Development of Huelva (in Spanish: Polo Químico de Promoción y Desarrollo de Huelva), also known simply as the Chemical Park of Huelva or Chemical Pole of Huelva (Polo Químico de Huelva), is the name given to the group of facilities and infrastructures belonging to the petrochemical industry sector located in the province of Huelva (Spain), south of the provincial capital's urban center. The industrial complex was started up during the second half of the 20th century, covering various branches of production.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe province of Huelva has historically been an important mining center, to which was added its natural outlet to the sea through the Huelva estuary. The Riotinto and Tharsis-La Zarza mining basins have been especially important. Therefore, since prehistoric times the transit between the mining areas and the coast, generally through the Tinto River, was frequent. Already in the 19th century different mining companies, such as the Rio Tinto Company Limited or Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Limited, promoted a first industrialization in the area but it would not be until the 20th century when the proposals to develop these lands came to fruition.\nThe first intention to install an important industrial complex in Huelva was proposed in 1870 by José Monasterio Correa. At the beginning of the 20th century, Francisco Montenegro Avenue was opened on the left bank of the Odiel River with the dredging of the same river to allow access to larger ships to the port of Huelva, especially to the mining docks of Tharsis and Rio Tinto. These lands were created as land for industrial use and were offered to the mining companies to develop their processing activity on them, without success initially, since the minerals continued to be exported without being transformed into metals or fertilizers.\nIt was not until 1964 when the Franco Government —during the mayoralty in the capital of Federico Molina— approved by decree of January 30, 1964 the construction of an Industrial Promotion Pole in these lands, which would change the geography, the population and the politics of the area in many aspects. Its installation in the area was due (among other aspects) to the high degree of underdevelopment and unemployment then existing in the area, and to the need to take advantage of the enormous and nearby mining production, thus making it possible for it to be worked and remain in the country. Companies such as the Compañía Española de Minas de Río Tinto (CEMRT) played an important role in the development of the Huelva Chemical Pole. In fact, CEMRT installed an electrolytic plant in the area to obtain pure copper, as well as an oil refinery in the area of Palos de la Frontera, chemical production plants, etc. Years later, the Unión Explosivos Río Tinto (ERT) group, the successor of the former CEMRT, came to exercise an important predominance in the Chemical Pole.\nBetween the 1970s and 1980s, the Chemical Pole underwent a major expansion, which included the installation of new factories and various facilities. During those years, companies such as Río Gulf Petroquímica, Ertisa, Río Tinto Minera, Foret, Interquímica, Fosfórico Español, Odiel Química, Fertiberia, Derivados del Flúor, etc. were installed in the area. Later, after the industrial reconversion of the years 1980–1990, companies such as CLH, Atlantic Copper, Cepsa, Ence, FMC Foret or Repsol were installed. In the 1980s, the problem caused by pollution began to become evident, since by 1987 the plants of the Industrial Pole were dumping some 50,000 tons of sulfuric acid, 12,000 tons of heavy metals and 700,000 tons of sulfates into the Huelva estuary. Faced with the ecological degradation of the water and the serious environmental problem this caused, in 1987 the authorities drew up a Discharge Correction Plan to reverse this situation.\n\n\n== Industrial areas ==\nThe different industrial facilities have ended up covering different spaces in the area:\n\nFrancisco Montenegro Avenue to Punta del Sebo, the natural mouth of the Odiel and Tinto rivers.\nTo join the banks of the Tinto River, a bridge was built for road and rail traffic, which at the time was the widest in Spain, from Punta del Sebo (Huelva) to the Outer Port (Palos de la Frontera), making possible the installation of most of the industries in this area.\nOld Seville road, in an area near San Juan del Puerto, where mainly companies related to the manufacture of cellulose were installed.\n\n\n== Railway network ==\nThe Huelva Chemical Pole is linked to the Seville-Huelva line by a branch that connects with it through the so-called Las Metas junction (kilometer point 106.750). A short distance from the fork is the Huelva-Mercancías station, which has a marshalling yard for merchant trains. The branch line is of Iberian-gauge and is owned by the Huelva Port Authority. Within the Hub there is a 32-kilometer network of railroad tracks that covers the industrial zones and the outer port of Huelva.\n\n\n== Economic and social impact ==\n\nSince the Chemical Pole came into service, the city and nearby towns have been linked to the chemical industry, oil refining, natural gas, petrochemicals, biofuels, logistics, copper metallurgy and power plants. At present, the cluster contributes an important part of the provincial GDP and more than 15,000 jobs. With more than 1,500 hectares, it is the second largest industrial complex in the country, with numerous companies installed, most of them grouped in the Asociación de Industrias Químicas, Básicas y Energéticas de Huelva (AIQBE), which generate 6,000 direct jobs.\nIn another sense, some environmental groups have denounced serious associated diseases, as well as a significant ecological setback in the area, indicating that the province of Huelva is located in the area known as the \"triangle of death\" or \"ground zero\". This area is made up of the provinces of Cádiz, Huelva and Seville.\nAccording to the mortality map of Spain, \"we see a higher mortality rate in the south than in the north of Spain. This reflects, in part, socioeconomic inequality\", a difference that lies in diseases associated with socioeconomic inequalities. Initial studies by the National Epidemiology Center of the Carlos III Health Institute, Greenpeace or the Pompeu Fabra University seemed to indicate that the cancer rate in this province is the highest in Spain, indicating that the risk of cancer is 50% higher than in the rest of Spain. For its part, an initial study by the Huelva Environmental Quality Plan, coordinated by the CSIC, indicated that, due to causes that could be attributed to poverty, food, smoking or pollution, in Huelva there is an excess of cancer mortality in the order of 10% for men and 6% for women, compared to the Andalusian average.\nHowever, subsequent studies show that the incidence of cancer in the province is within the national and regional average, as stated by Health officials of the Andalusian Regional Government and observed in the annual data of the National Epidemiology Center, clarifying that these levels are not attributable to industrial activity.\n\n\n=== The phosphogypsum ===\nAs a result of the activities of Fertiberia, and to a lesser extent of FMC Foret, another 1,200 ha are indirectly occupied by the Chemical Pole. These are the phosphogypsum ponds, which are located some 700 meters from the Pérez Cubillas neighborhood in Huelva and two kilometers from the center of the capital, next to which a thousand homes and a commercial park have been built. The phosphogypsum ponds of the Huelva Chemical Pole are made up of less than 80 million tons of this material, compared to the more than 3,000 million tons currently piled up in Europe and the world.\nPhosphogypsum is the by-product of the wet production of phosphoric acid in the Fertiberia and FMC Foret plants, which treated phosphoric rock from various places such as South Africa, Israel, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Togo or Senegal with sulfuric acid, obtaining phosphoric acid as a product and gypsum (phosphogypsum) as a by-product. This activity stopped in 2010 and since that date there is no discharge in these ponds, and the company Fertiberia is waiting for the administrative permits to start the works of the restoration project designed following the indications of the National Court and the competent Ministries at the time, which already ruled -in a final judgment- that the phosphogypsum would not be moved to another place.\nGreenpeace denounced that the cancer rate in Huelva is the highest in Spain and that the phosphogypsum ponds emit radiation 27 times higher than what is allowed. However, subsequent studies, cited above, show that cancer in Huelva is within the average values for Spain and Andalusia. Regarding radioactivity, the Nuclear Safety Council, in all its studies and reports (including those destined to Congress and the Senate), indicates that there is no radiological risk in Huelva or in the phosphogypsum ponds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPort of Huelva\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDelgado, Aquilino; Campos, Ángel; Narbona, Saúl (2009). \"The Río Tinto railway.

        "content": "Jacques Andre Poitras (born 1967 or 1968) is a Canadian journalist and author. As New Brunswick's provincial affairs reporter for CBC News, Poitras does reporting work for politics within New Brunswick. Outside of doing reporting work, Poitras has wrote five non-fiction books, which he has received multiple awards and nominations for.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nJacques Poitras was born in Moncton, New Brunswick, in either 1967 or 1968. After attending Moncton High School, Poitras attended Carleton University's School of Journalism, where he received his Bachelor of Journalism in 1990 and Master of Journalism in 1991. Additionally, Poitras was listed in the Deans' Honour List in 1989. After graduating, Poitras began his career in journalism as an intern staff writer for The Kingston Whig-Standard, after which worked for the English weekly newspaper Prognosis, which was based in the Czech Republic capital Prague.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Journalism in New Brunswick ===\nIn 1993, after working for Prognosis, Poitras began working as a reporter for the Telegraph-Journal, a Saint John-based daily newspaper then-owned by Irving, during which he reported on Canadian Parliament affairs as a correspondent based in Ottawa. In 1999, Poitras received an Amnesty International Canada media award under the \"Local/Alternative Print\" category. Since 2000, Poitras has worked for CBC News as New Brunswick's provincial affairs reporter. Based in Fredericton, he does political reporting in New Brunswick, covering topics such as elections and electoral districts. Poitras has also served as the New Brunswick Legislature's press gallery president, and has done extensive reporting work on the legislature. For two consecutive years, Poitras was a recipient of RTDNA Canada's \"top national feature reporting award.\" The National Newspaper Awards have also given attention to his work. In 2019, Poitras published an article about Blaine Higgs on The Canadian Encyclopedia.\nIn 2022, he participated as a mentor for the Canadian Association of Journalists' mentorship program. Poitras has also done part-time teaching at St. Thomas University. During the 2024 Atlantic Journalism Awards, Poitras, along with Danielle McCreadie and Vanessa Vander Valk, received the gold award under the \"Audio\" category's \"Breaking News\" section for their report on Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Dorothy Shephard resigning surrounding the events of Policy 713.\n\n\n=== Author ===\nPoitras has wrote five non-fiction books, two of which have been finalist nominations for the Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing, which he was also a jurist of during the 2023 nominations. His debut book, The Right Fight: Bernard Lord and the Conservative Dilemma, was published by Goose Lane Editions in 2004. The gives a three-decade long historical recount of politics in New Brunswick and additionally covers then-Premier Bernard Lord, and was shortlisted for the Atlantic Booksellers' Choice Award. For a portion of the book, Poitras interviewed former New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party member and Progressive Conservative MLA Tony Huntjens, who said in quotes that he \"opposes duality in the education system and remains hopeful the two systems can be integrated someday,\" which resulted in him being criticized by the Acadian Society of New Brunswick as well as the New Brunswick Liberal Association.\nIn 2007, he published Beaverbrook: A Shattered Legacy, a biography about Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. Later in 2011, he wrote the Goose Lane Editions-published Imaginary Line: Life on an Unfinished Border. In writing the book, which was a finalist nomination for the Shaughnessy Cohen Price for Political Writing, Poitras had to repeatedly cross the border and check for boundary markers, and spent a month during May 2010 interviewing residents on both sides along the border. The book covers the history of the Canada–United States border between New Brunswick and Maine as well as the issues faced by locals due to the strengthened border regulations that resulted from the September 11 attacks.\nHis 2018 Pipe Dreams: The Fight for Canada’s Energy Future, published by Penguin Random House Canada, delves into the failed Energy East pipeline proposal in Canada. It was named the Petroleum History Society's 2018 Book of the Year, was a finalist nominated for the 2018 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing, shortlisted for the for the John W. Dafoe Book Prize in 2019, and was additionally a bronze medalist for the 2020 Axion Business Book Awards under the \"Business Commentary\" category. Michael Sobota of The Chronicle-Journal called the book an \"industrial thriller,\" adding that Poitras' \"narrative is well researched with facts, data and personal opinions from a full spectrum of those involved with or impacted by the project.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe Right Fight: Bernard Lord and the Conservative Dilemma.

        "content": "On September 17, 2023, clashes broke out between the CSP-PSD and the Malian junta in Léré, Mali. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the start of 2023, tensions had intensified between the Malian junta that took power in 2021 and the allied Wagner Group mercenaries against the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD), a coalition of the former rebel Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) and the pro-government Platform militias. Malian and Wagner forces attacked the town of Ber in August 2023, the first major clashes between the two groups since the signing of the Algiers Accords in 2015. CSP-PSD spokesmen denounced the attack, and stated that retaliation would occur. They then attacked Malian forces in Bourem a few weeks later, with both sides declaring victory. Following the attack on Bourem, the CSp_PSD declared war on the Malian junta.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAt 1:30 local time on September 17, CSP-PSD fighters attacked two Malian military camps in Léré, Tombouctou Region, Mali. Fighting lasted for two hours, and the CSP-PSD seized both military camps in the town. RFI claimed that the CSP-PSD had also effectively seized control of the town of Lere during the battle, but journalist Wassim Nasr rebutted this and stated that Malian soldiers had sought refuge in the town center after the capture of their bases, and that the CSP-PSD did not enter the town. The CSP-PSD retreated from the bases between 2 and 3am on September 18, leaving with lots of weaponry and Malian equipment.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe day after the battle, the Malian junta denounced an attack by \"evil forces\" against the military camps at Lere and promised retribution. Later that night, the Malian Army published a statement reporting the deaths of five Malian soldiers, twenty injured, and eleven missing. The Malian Army also estimated that eight CSP-PSD vehicles were destroyed with thirty men killed or injured, but stated that they only found the bodies of seven militants within the camps boundaries.\nThe CSP-PSD claimed the deaths of thirty-five Malian soldiers during the battle, along with six taken prisoner, several dozen injured, several vehicles captured, and a large number of weapons and equipment seized. They also stated eight fighters were killed and twelve were wounded. The CSP-PSD published several videos and photos of the attack on social media during and after the battle. They also claimed the destruction of a Malian L-39 Albatros plane above the city with photographic evidence, and claimed that another plane was damaged and eventually crashed. The Malian Army only acknowledged the downing of one plane due to technical issues, and stated it's crew was still being sought out.\n\n\n== References ==",
