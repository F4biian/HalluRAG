        "content": "Melcior Marial Mundet (12 June 1887 – Unknown) was a Spanish federal engineer and politician during the Second Spanish Republic.\nHe was the son of fellow politician Juli Marial Tey and brother of FC Barcelona president Juli Marial.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nMelcior Marial was born in Barcelona on 12 June 1887, as the son of architect and politician Juli Marial Tey and Caterina Mundet i Farreras, and the younger brother of Juli Marial.\nMarial married Berthe Willote i Rossel, and the couple had two children, Alicia, writer, and Juli, engineer.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nMarial was part of the Madrid municipal committee of the Federal Democratic Republican Party, of which he was one of its leaders, at least since August 1929, and its top leader since May 1931. This grouping, like other local and provincial organizations, endowed with great autonomy, it continued to be part of the Republican Alliance. Although the new federal national leadership established in 1930 was not admitted to the Republican revolutionary committee and, therefore, was not represented in the lists of the Republican–Socialist Conjunction in the 1931 Spanish local elections, the federal assemblies that were part of the Alliance did, thus obtaining a place in the list of the Conjunction for the elections to Constituent Courts in the constituency of Madrid capital, which was occupied by Marial. He obtained 106,879 votes, being the Republican member of the candidacy that obtained fewer votes.\nIn the Congress, Marial was integrated into the federal minority, formed by federalists also chosen in republican-socialist lists, and of a moderate character, presided over by José Franchy y Roca. During the discussion of the constitution, Marial, like the rest of his co-religionists, promoted the definition of the new State as a federal republic, without achieving it. In the final period of the constituent legislature, when Franchy Roca joined the government as Minister of Industry and Commerce, Marial was director general of Commerce (June-September 1933). He was also Director General of Labor in the last cabinet of the legislature, with Diego Martínez Barrio as President of the Government and Carles Pi i Sunyer of the Republican Left of Catalonia as Minister of Labor.\nIn the 1933 Spanish general election, the Republican Left of Catalonia was willing to include members of the federal party in its lists, so Marial was a candidate for the province of Girona. He was also part of the left-wing Republican candidacy for Madrid, composed of Republican Action, independent radical-socialists, left-wing independents, and federalists. The results in Madrid were bad, and he was the third least voted candidate of the candidacy, which for his part was only the fourth most voted, without obtaining representation. However, in Girona he was chosen.\nMarial was imprisoned after the events of 6 October, but released in December of that year. Despite being part of the parliamentary minority of Esquerra Catalana, Marial also joined the new federal party created in 1935 and headed by Franchy Roca and Arauz, Esquerra Federal, of which he was vice-president.\nAfter the victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 Spanish general electionel, he was named president of the Coordinating Council of the National Economy, dependent on the Ministry of Industry, being Minister Plácido Álvarez-Buylla. He remained in office after the start of the Spanish Civil War, when on 25 July 1936, he was named first president of the Committee for Provisional Intervention in Industries. that he had to take control of the confiscated factories. The council was abolished on 28 September of the same year.\nOn 30 August 1936, Minister Álvarez-Buylla appointed him president of the executive committee of the General Electricity Council.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAvilés Farré, Juan (2006).

        "content": "Eugene Gressman (April 18, 1917 – January 23, 2010) was an American lawyer and legal scholar whose expertise centered on the Supreme Court of the United States. With Robert L. Stern, he was the co-author of the book Supreme Court Practice, which is considered the preeminent lawyers' guide to the Court's practices and procedures.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGressman was born on April 18, 1917, in Lansing, Michigan. His father was a lawyer and fundamentalist minister, and his mother was a librarian. He enrolled at the University of Michigan 1934, graduating with a A.B. degree in 1938. He received his law degree with distinction from the University of Michigan Law School in 1940.: 1 \n\n\n== Early career ==\nAfter graduating law school, Gressman worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission for three years until 1943, when he began clerking for Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy. He continued to clerk for Murphy until the latter's death in 1948, making his the longest clerkship in the history of the Supreme Court.: 1  Gressman's experience clerking for Murphy marked the beginning of a long relationship with the Supreme Court, and with many of its justices. He subsequently began working in private practice at the Washington, D. C.-based law firm Van Arkel & Kaiser, where his work focused primarily on labor law and appellate practice. He continued to work at this firm for nearly thirty years before leaving to become a law professor.: 2–3 \n\n\n== Academic career ==\nIn 1977, Gressman left private practice to become the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. He remained on the faculty there until retiring in 1987. In the same year he retired, he received the Frederick B. McCall Award for Teaching Excellence from the University of North Carolina School of Law.: 4–5  When he retired from the University of North Carolina in 1987, the North Carolina Law Review dedicated an issue to his retirement, which featured a tribute to Gressman by then-Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. In his article, Justice Powell noted that Gressman was \"a lawyer whose name is closely associated with the Supreme Court Justices\". He then joined the faculty of the Seton Hall University School of Law as its Richard J. Hughes Distinguished Visiting professor of law, a position he held from 1987 to 1994, after which he returned to the University of North Carolina School of Law as a professor emeritus.: 5 \n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nGressman was married to Nan Gressman, an artist, for sixty years prior to her death in 2004. They had four children together: William, Nancy, Margot, and Eric.: 5–6  Eugene Gressman died on January 23, 2010, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at the age of 92.: 1 \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The eighth generation, GMT400-based Chevrolet Suburban and its derivatives was introduced in December 1991 for the 1992 model year. The C/K pickup had already switched to the newer platform in 1987 for the 1988 model year. Both 2WD and 4WD models—designated \"C\" and \"K\"—were offered, as well as half-ton and three-quarter-ton (\"1500\" and \"2500\") models.\nThe base engine for all variants was the small-block 5.7-liter V8. The big-block 7.4-liter V8 was optional for the 2500 series. The optional 6.5-liter turbo diesel was available for 1994 on 2500 models and from 1995 to 1999 on all models, though rare on the 1500 series. 1500 Suburbans with the 6.5-liter turbo diesel were based on the 2500 series, sharing several mechanical components including the frame, 14-bolt axle, and eight-bolt wheels wearing LT-rated tires. However, their GVWRs were derated from 8600 lbs to 7700 lbs (on 2WD models) and 8050 lbs (on 4WD models). Ground clearance was 6.9 inches (175 mm), the approach angle was 18 degrees for the K1500 (28 degrees for the K2500), and the break-over angle was 18 degrees.\nTransmissions included the 4L60 four-speed automatic in the 1500 series, and the heavier-duty 4L80 four-speed automatic in the 2500 series and the 1500 series fitted with the 6.5-liter turbo diesel. The manual transmission option from the previous generation was dropped.\nThe GMT400 series introduced an independent front suspension. The 2WD models used coil springs and 4WD models used torsion bars in the front suspension. All models used a live axle and leaf springs in the rear.\nThe 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time for a 1995 Suburban with the 5.7L engine was 9.3 seconds. The top speed was governed on the engine for fuel economy. A maximum of 98 mph (158 km/h) could be obtained. City fuel economy was 13 mpg‑US (18 L/100 km; 16 mpg‑imp) and highway was 15 mpg‑US (16 L/100 km; 18 mpg‑imp) while the turning circle was 47.8 ft (14.6 m). For 1996, fuel economy had improved to 17 mpg‑US (14 L/100 km; 20 mpg‑imp) highway.\nTrim options included a base-level version, the LS, and the LT (the latter two were originally the \"Silverado\" trim). Interior seating arrangements allowed for either bucket or bench seating in the first row and optional third-row bench. The vehicle could be configured from two- to nine-passenger seating.\nBeginning in 1994, GM began making numerous annual changes to the Suburban, including:\n\nRevised front clip and center stop lamp (1994)\nRevised interior including a driver-side air bag, revised side mirrors, Silverado trim split into LS and LT (1995)\nRevised 350 cu in (5.7 L) Vortec 5700 and 454 cu in (7.4 L) Vortec 7400 engines with increased power and fuel efficiency, electronic 4WD shifting, daytime running lights, illuminated entry, and some new interior features (1996)\nRevised transmissions, improved steering system, and added passenger-side airbag (1997)\nOnStar, PassLock security system and full-time AutoTrac 4WD option added, next-generation \"depowered\" air bags, revised steering wheel, transmissions revised again (1998)\nNo major changes upon introduction of redesigned 2000 models (1999)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Holden Suburban ==\nIn Australia and New Zealand, Holden imported the right-hand-drive Chevrolet Suburban built by GM in Silao, Mexico, between February 1998 and January 2001. The Suburban was first previewed in October 1997 at the Sydney Motor Show. In total, 746 were sold (460 petrol and 286 diesel). After 2001, subsequent models reverted to the original Chevrolet brand, which had also been used before 1998. Over the model's lifetime there were three trim levels: a base model, the LS and the LT. Not to be confused with the trim variants is the model code, designated K8.\n\nThe Holden's interior differed from that of the American version, as the right-hand drive dashboard of the Blazer was used instead. However, it had to be stretched on the passenger (left) side to fit in the larger Suburban. A bench seat came standard on the entry-level variant as well as the LS, but the more expensive LT received bucket seats. With the omission of the center seat, the LT has a maximum seating capacity of eight, compared to nine.\nCreature comforts standard in all models included a LCD compass in the rear-view mirror, a tilt adjustable steering wheel, a driver's airbag, ABS brakes, and dual-zone air conditioning. The second tier LS brought alloy wheels, power windows and mirrors among some features. To further up the ante, the LT gained electric front seats, leather trim, and a horizontally slated, two-part tailgate. This came as opposed to the \"barn doors\" found on the other specifications.\nThe Suburban was offered with the choice of either a 5.7-liter Vortec V8, producing 190 kW (255 hp; 258 PS) and 447 N⋅m (330 lb⋅ft; 46 kg⋅m) of torque, or a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 outputting 145 kW (194 hp; 197 PS) and 583 N⋅m (430 lb⋅ft; 59 kg⋅m). The former choice was designated the \"1500\" name, while the turbodiesel saw the \"2500\" name. The 5.7-liter petrol engine is LPG-compatible, and such systems can be retrofitted if desired. Regardless of the engine specified, the truck was equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. However, what differed was the type of transmission. Petrol motors were fitted with the GM 4L60-E transmission, with the GM 4L80-E reserved for the diesel. A dashboard switch allows the vehicle to power all four wheels simultaneously, or the rear wheels only, and allows the low range gearing to be engaged.\nThe vehicle's fuel efficiency has been rated at 19.7 L/100 km (14.3 mpg‑imp; 11.9 mpg‑US) for the diesel specification, with that figure rising to 21.8 L/100 km (13.0 mpg‑imp; 10.8 mpg‑US) for the petrol model. With the hefty fuel consumption comes a 159-litre (35 imp gal; 42 US gal) fuel tank.\nTo combat the extra payload and towing capacity of the diesel, an improved braking package, as well as super heavy duty axles and suspension were fitted. Holden recommends a maximum 3,400 kilograms (7,500 lb) towing limit for the turbo diesels, with a reduced figure of 2,720 kilograms (6,000 lb) for the petrol models.\nThe Holden Suburban's run wasn't the first or only time that Holden had sold the GMT400 platform in Oceania.  Beginning in 1996, they imported GMC C/Ks for ambulance conversions. Unlike the Suburbans, these vehicles were not available to the general public, nor did they bear Holden badging. They also were not built as right-hand-drives from the factory like the Suburban was; the same company that handled the ambulance conversion (Jakab Ambulance in Tamworth) also switched the steering to the other side.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Berlengas was a maritime confrontation which took place in April 1714, off the coast of the Berlengas Islands, involving a Portuguese merchant ship and three Barbary pirate frigates. This event is noteworthy for its historical significance as an example of Portuguese maritime resistance against pirate attacks during the 18th century.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the early 18th century, maritime routes were subject to frequent pirate attacks, especially in the waters of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The Berlengas, an archipelago located off the Portuguese coast, represented a strategic point on the route of ships sailing between Portugal and its colonies. However, Algerian privateers continued to operate off the coast, although perhaps with apparent less success, as news of attacks only\nIn April 1714, a Portuguese merchant ship returning from the Bay (present-day Salvador, Brazil) was attacked by three Barbary pirate frigates off the Berlengas. The pirate frigates, armed with one of 50 guns, another of 40, and another of 30, initiated the engagement with an artillery duel that lasted over two hours. Both sides fired about fourteen salvos, despite adverse conditions of rough seas and strong winds. However, Algerian privateers continued to operate off the coast, although perhaps with apparent less success, as news of attacks only emerged in the last months of the year.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAfter realizing that they could not win solely through long-range combat, the pirates attempted to board the Portuguese ship on three occasions, but their assaults were repelled due to the resistance of the Portuguese and the unfavorable weather conditions. During the boarding attempts, the Portuguese ship suffered nine casualties and thirty wounded, while the damage to the vessel was minimal. However, Algerian privateers continued to operate off the coast, although perhaps with apparent less success, as news of attacks only emerged in the last months of the year.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter three failed boarding attempts and suffering an unknown number of casualties and damages, the pirates decided to end the engagement and withdraw. The Portuguese ship managed to return to the Tagus River safely, despite the challenges faced during the confrontation. However, Algerian privateers continued to operate off the coast, although perhaps with apparent less success, as news of attacks only emerged in the last months of the year.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Battle of Berlengas of 1714 is remembered as an example of the determination and skill of Portuguese navigators in resisting pirate attacks during the colonial period. This event highlights the importance of defending maritime routes and protecting Portugal's commercial interests in the Atlantic. However, Algerian privateers continued to operate off the coast, although perhaps with apparent less success, as news of attacks only emerged in the last months of the year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Physcia ucrainica is a species of foliose lichen in the family Physciaceae, described from the Crimean Peninsula. It occupies a transitional phylogenetic position related closely to both the Physcia adscendens and Physcia stellaris groups.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nPhyscia ucrainica was formally described as a new species in 2015 by the lichenologists Sergey Kondratyuk, László Lőkös, and Jae-Seoun Hur. The specific epithet ucrainica refers to its type locality in Ukraine. Molecular analysis indicates that Physcia biziana and Physcia orientostellaris are closely related within the genus Physcia, forming a clade with P. ucrainica as their sister taxon.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPhyscia ucrainica is distinguished by its rosette-like thallus which forms long and narrow lobes that are only horizontally oriented. Unlike Physcia adscendens, it lacks ascending, helmet-shaped lobes and instead features well-developed, laminal, crater-like soralia mainly in the centre of the thallus. These soralia are unique in that they burst through the lichen's upper surface. The lichen is greyish white to dirty grey overall, with a darker grey centre where older soralia are located. The lobes have visible rhizines and cilia, contributing to its distinctive morphology.\nAn unusual form of the common Physcia adscendens is found in Greece, in which the soralia occur mainly scattered on the thallus surface, where they cause perforations of the thallus lobes. The resultant morphology was noted to be similar to that of Physcia ucrainica, although molecular phylogenetics analysis of the internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences of these taxa suggest that they are independent lineages.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThis species is commonly found on horizontally oriented branches of Juniperus excelsa within Juniper forests of the \"Novy Svit\" Botanical Reserve near Sudak, Crimea. It thrives in Mediterranean Juniperus-Quercus forests, often in association with species like Catapyrenium psoroideum and various other Mediterranean-Atlantic lichens. Physcia ucrainica is known primarily from its type locality in Crimea, where it can be locally abundant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Do It Again\" (stylised in all caps) is a song by New Zealand singer Benee featuring Australian singer Mallrat, released through Republic Records on 28 June 2023. The song peaked at number 30 on the New Zealand Hot Singles Chart, and was the official song of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nSpeaking about the song to Stereogum, Benee spoke about the song and said:\n\nBeing a small part of this incredible celebration of women’s sport is an absolute dream come true for me. As a keen young football player, I just couldn’t have imagined this! I’ve loved the experience of writing a song which I hope reflects my excitement at having the world’s biggest women’s sports event held on my home turf, and I can’t wait to perform \"Do It Again\" live with Mallrat at the opening ceremony.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis collaboration was not the first time the pair had made a collaborative song, \"Winter\" from Benee's debut album Hey U X, was also a track featuring the Australian artist. The pair, from both hosting countries, Australia and New Zealand, performed the song at the ceremony in Auckland's Eden Park, and was the first time the event had been held in the Southern Hemisphere and the first time that hosting the event had been split between two countries.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMegan Armstrong of Uproxx said the track was an \"empowered, pulsating anthem [and a] guaranteed summer earworm even outside of its World Cup placement\" and FIFA said the track is a \"vibrant and infectious anthem that promises to captivate fans\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The People’s Military Service Law is a compulsory conscription law enacted by the military junta in Myanmar. Initially drafted in 2010 by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's armed forces, the law was enforced on February 10, 2024, in response to the ongoing Myanmar Civil War.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== History of Compulsory Conscription in Myanmar ===\nCompulsory conscription in Myanmar dates back to the mid-1950s, with military leaders initially proposing it due to fears of potential invasions by neighboring countries. The National Service Bill was drafted in 1955 but only taken to parliament to be enacted under the caretaker government of 1958 to 1960, with its enforcement status being unclear.Before 1988, the military primarily relied on volunteers to replenish its ranks, using the provisions of the National Service Bill to enlist technical specialists like doctors and engineers. Forced recruitment became prevalent after the 8888 Uprising and the military's subsequent expansion. Reports indicated arbitrary recruitment of individuals, including minors, into the Tatmadaw and other militia groups without specific compulsory military service laws.Despite widespread forced recruitment, the military leadership hesitated to implement mandatory conscription, fearing internal dissent that could threaten the regime. When the conscription law was presented on November 4, 2010, it generated significant public panic and criticism, leading quasi-civilian governments from 2011 to 2021 to delay its enforcement. It wasn't until February 10, 2024, following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'etat and the start of the Myanmar Civil War, that the military regime enforced mandatory conscription under the People’s Military Service Law.\n\n\n=== Civil War ===\nThe mandatory conscription requirement in Myanmar reveals a significant shortage of military personnel, with estimates showing a drastic reduction in junta military forces from around 300,000 to 400,000 pre-civil war to approximately 130,000 by late 2023. False reports and inflated personnel data may have misled junta leadership, leading to a sense of complacency about the military's actual strength and capacity.The lack of ground troops has compelled the military to cede control over large territories, including key urban regions and strategically vital military installations, marking the most substantial losses in its history. Despite initial reliance on airstrikes and heavy weaponry to compensate for troop shortages, the lack of manpower continued to be a significant demoralizing factor for the military. The success of Operation 1027 and other rebel offensives has led to a sense of urgency in the enforcement of conscription laws.\n\n\n== Provisions ==\nThe law targets draft-eligible individuals, including men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27, with provisions allowing for the conscription of older individuals classified as \"professional\" up to the ages of 45 and 35, respectively. Penalties are imposed for evasion of military service or aiding others in evading conscription.\n\n\n== Enforcement ==\nAccording to Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, young men have allegedly been abducted from the urban areas of Myanmar and coerced into enlisting in the military in recent months. Additionally, reports suggest that villagers have been forced to serve as porters and human shields.\nThe regime has stated it intends to draft 60,000 men annually via this law.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe implementation of mandatory conscription under the People’s Military Service Law has escalated instability in Myanmar and raised alarms about the safety and well-being of civilian populations. The law has intensified calls for international intervention to protect vulnerable communities and prevent further violence and human rights violations in the country. Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, called it an attack on civilian rights in the country.\n\n\n=== Exodus ===\nAs a result of the enforcement of the law, thousands of young people have begun to flee the country to avoid being taken in for mandatory conscription.\n\n\n=== Retaliation ===\nIn response to the enactment of the law by the junta in Myanmar, there has been a surge in retaliatory attacks against local officials involved in carrying out conscription efforts. Rebel officials and residents report that at least 17 officials have been killed since the draft law was implemented in early March, as per March 27, with the number of killings tripling in just one week.]\n\n\n==== List of Retaliatory Incidents ====\n(Partial, By March 27)\n\nFebruary 20, 2024: Administrator Nan Win from Shin Thabyay Pin village in Magway’s Taungdwingyi township found dead, allegedly killed by anti-junta People’s Defense Force members for pressuring residents to join military training.\nMarch 18, 2024: Administrator Myint Htoo of Pu Khat Taing village in Magway’s Salin township shot and killed by Salin Township PDF members as he called on residents to enlist for military service.\nMarch 19, 2024: Administrator Maung Pu of Wundwin township in Mandalay region killed by unidentified attackers while recruiting soldiers for the junta.\nMarch 20, 2024: Administrative officer Tin Win Khaing and clerk San Naing of Oke Shit Kone village in Magway’s Yenangyaung township killed.\nMarch 22 and 24, 2024: Junior clerk Mya Mye Nyein and administrator Nan Nwe Oo of Sagaing’s Shwebo township shot dead by guerrilla group Shwebo Ar Mann.\nMarch 24, 2024: Administrator San Lwin of Taung Ka Lay village in Mon’s Kyaikhto township shot dead by anti-junta Kyaikhto Revolution Force members.\nAdditionally, numerous buildings used by the Junta to recruit people have been burned down under mysterious circumstances, especially in the Hinthada and Yegyi townships. Rebel forces have warned administrators not to enforce the law, and as a result numerous administrators have resigned, citing the impossibility of their duties. 21 administrators in Rakhine’s Thandwe township collectively resigned, more than a third of Thandwe's 62 village administrators. Similar resignations have taken place in Thanlyin and Sanchaung townships in Yangon Region, and in the Bago Region.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Peaceful Valley Historic District is a National Register of Historic Places-listed historic district in the Peaceful Valley neighborhood of Spokane, Washington. It is located in the western half of the neighborhood, along the floor and southern slope of the Spokane River Gorge, immediately south of the Spokane River and downhill, just below Downtown Spokane. It is centered on the intersection of Main Avenue and Maple Street, stretching from there approximately two blocks in each direction.\nA residential area, Peaceful Valley was one of the first areas developed in the City of Spokane and was deemed historically significant as an intact example of a working-class neighborhood from the turn of the 20th century. Unlike many other historic districts around the city and state, Peaceful Valley does not represent the moneyed-elite whose grand homes and buildings have been preserved but rather homes of the working class laborers who helped built Spokane throughout its early decades.\nLocated in a steep valley just downstream of Spokane Falls and immediately below the city center which lies on the flat land at the top of the valley to the south and east. This location, isolated by the river and deep gorge, have helped preserve Peaceful Valley's architectural character into the 21st cenutry, though some construction projects such as the Maple Street Bridge which was constructed over the area in the late 1950s have slightly altered the appearance in places, though not the overall cohesion, of the district.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nThe Peaceful Valley Historic District is located in the Peaceful Valley neighborhood, immediately west and north of Downtown Spokane. The Spokane River runs immediately to the north of the historic district as it cuts a deep gorge flowing west from the Spokane Falls just upstream. The river is at approximately 1,740 feet above sea level as it flows through this portion of the gorge, with the surrounding land at the top of the gorge at approximately 1,880 feet above sea level. The valley from crest to crest is about one-half mile wide here, with areas immediately up and downstream being even thinner. The southern portion of the historic district, around Wilson, Clarke and the eastern portion of Main Avenue sits above the northern portion of the district which lies along the floodplain of the river.\nDue to the constraints of the terrain, there are only two roads leading into the historic district. Main Avenue connects to the center of Downtown Spokane from the east while Clarke Avenue runs west into the rest of the Peaceful Valley neighborhood and provides access to the adjacent West Hills and Browne's Addition neighborhoods. A staircase connects Peaceful Valley with downtown, specifically the also-NRHP-listed Riverside Avenue Historic District, at Cedar Street. Just west of that staircase, the Maple Street Bridge crosses over the gorge right through the heart of the district, connecting Downtown and the rest of the south side of the city with the West Central neighborhood and the rest of the north side.\n\nThere are two public parks located in the historic district. Redband Park, formerly known as Glover Field, is located in the northeastern most corner of the district, and Peaceful Valley Park occupies the land directly underneath the Maple Street Bridge from Wilson Avenue in the south to the river in the north.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhat is now the Peaceful Valley Historic District was for centuries part of the traditional lands of the Spokane people. Its proximity to Spokane Falls made it an ideal location for salmon fishing for not only the Spokane but also other tribes from around the region.\nThe earliest white settlers in the area began to arrive after Spokane was incorporated in 1881. Originally a hard-scrabble neighborhood known as Poverty Flat, separated from the wealthy Browne's Addition and bustling central business district by the steep bluffs. Early maps of the city, such as one from 1884, depict no structures in the area, though it would become home to squatters and people living in simple shacks. An 1891 story in the Spokane Falls Review announced plans to clear squatters from the area:\n\nThe district immediately below the falls upon the south side of the river which has for some time been inhabited by families of very humble circumstances, is being rapidly cleared of its former denizens and their domiciles and restored to its primieval character. This work has been undertaken by Messrs. Cannon and Browne, proprietors of the tract, and by the City Board of Health.\n\nThis action came after the neighborhood was platted in November 1890 and lots began to sell. Real estate developer C.F. Clough platted lots into 25-by-100 foot rectangles. Lots began to sell, but in order to accelerate development, Clough renamed the area Peaceful Valley to distance itself from the previous Poverty Flat moniker. The name was borrowed from an 1893 play of the same name by Edward E. Kidder. Despite the name change, development remained slow due to the Panic of 1893.\nDevelopment came to the neighborhood in earnest once the economy began to recover in the late 1890s. Many of the earliest residents of Peaceful Valley were immigrants from northern European countries drawn to Spokane for work as laborers. The city was undergoing a population boom and needed to rebuild from the Great Spokane Fire that destroyed the downtown area. The rebuild was necessitated by the booming population of the city, which allowed it to persist despite the financial crisis. This gave these laborers the means to eventually purchase lots and build in Peaceful Valley. These early residents were largely from Finland, Sweden and Germany. The Finns presence was especially felt in the early days due to the Finnish Social Hall built about a block west of the current district boundaries and the multiple saunas constructed around the district.\nConstruction took off around the turn of the century. By 1910, homes had been built upon most lots in the district. They were mostly simple, one-to-two story wooden homes. Other styles in the district were \"row cabins\" consisting of one-room dwellings connected to form a long building, meant for seasonal workers. There were also a few commercial buildings, notably the Spokane Casket Company  between Water Avenue and the Spokane River in the northwest corner of the district. Other commercial businesses included grocers, butcheries, barbers, saloons and laundries, as the steep surrounding terrain isolated the neighborhood and necessitated having those services in the area. Connectivity with downtown improved in 1911 when Main Avenue was given a more moderate grade after construction of the Monroe Street Bridge.\n\nThe isolating terrain necessitated a steep walk to and from school for neighborhood children, who were forced to walk up paths, and later stairs, to attend school in the Browne's Addition neighborhood above. Things began to change for the children in 1915 when residents, led by Mrs. George Holley, petitioned the school board to build a school in the area by claiming the arduous walk through snow and rain was a danger to the children's' health. Cowley School opened at Clarke and Maple in 1917 and would operate until 1930 when it closed due to lack of students.\nStarting in 1912 when the city purchased the land, and continuing until 1925, Glover Field, now known as Redband Park, was home to a stadium that hosted sporting events, fairs and festivals. The stadium's bleachers were condemned in 1925, though the field would continue to serve its original purpose. In 1925 and 1926, the park hosted the National Indian Congress.\nAs original residents aged from the 1920s through the 1940s, the character of the neighborhood changed slightly. Some homes were converted into apartments, and an increasing population of widows began bringing in renters to help make ends meet. The Northern European ethnic influence began to wane in this period, and the Finnish Social Hall was demolished in 1942.\nThe greatest upheaval to the state of the neighborhood came in the 1950s with the arrival of the Maple Street Bridge. Construction of the support piers under the bridge necessitated the demolition of entire blocks of homes along Maple Street. Initially after the construction, the empty land below the bridge was left vacant and became an eyesore for the neighborhood where plants would not grow and trash accumulated. The land would eventually be converted into a park, though not until the mid-1980s.\nWhile the neighborhood retained its working class character over the decades, in the 1960s and 1970s it also began to attract artists and Bohemian types attracted by the low rents and the history of maverick residents dating back to its early labor days. In 1972, a Spokane chapter of the Youth International Party was established with its headquarters in Peaceful Valley. By 1984, the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).\n\nIn the years since its listing on the NRHP, the area has retained much of its original historical integrity and character, but continued changes have come as well. As Spokane saw its population begin to grow again during the latter years of the 20th century and into the first decades of the 21st century, development projects in Peaceful Valley have impacted the visual appearance of the neighborhood. The neighborhood was featured in the 1992 film Benny and Joon, specifically the house at 301 N. Cedar Street. Some newer apartments and condominiums have been built in the area, and the neighborhood has been under repeated threat from developers proposing larger-scale projects either within the district or on the hillside directly above, which has led to repeated pushback from residents of the community.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPeaceful Valley, Spokane\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Spokane County, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Live in Kraków is a live album by Barry Altschul's 3dom Factor, led by drummer Altschul, and featuring saxophonist Jon Irabagon and double bassist Joe Fonda. The trio's third release, it was recorded on December 4th, 2016, at the Alchemia club in Kraków, Poland, and was issued on CD in 2017 by Not Two Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe noted that in a \"concert setting the group makes the most of the opportunity to stretch out and strut their stuff.\" He wrote: \"Over the four years since their inception, The 3Dom Factor has grown into a real unit, knowing who's capable of what, when and how... It's all done with an unselfconscious joy which brings a smile to the face.\"\nPhilip Clark of Jazzwise suggested that the trio's first two releases \"were such confident statements that this new one is more about evolution than radical revolution,\" and stated: \"the way these guys mess with time and math, they might well squeeze a fourth album into their trilogy.\"\nDusted Magazine's Derek Taylor commented: \"With Irabagon and Fonda [Altschul's] found partners on par with past peers, willing to embrace freedom without renouncing coherence and structure and most importantly remaining true to a reciprocal means of expression. The condition contained in the band's shorthand moniker is no casual or erroneous claim.\"\nWriting for London Jazz News, Jon Turney remarked: \"This is the liberation of 'we'll play anything we want', referencing the entire jazz tradition. You'll hear many facets of that tradition here, at different times, but the results sound as fresh as you could wish for.\"\nIn an article for Point of Departure, Bill Shoemaker called the album \"a classic old-school club date\" and \"a fine precis of Barry Altschul’s long, storied career.\" He wrote: \"Throughout, Alschul is the consummate band drummer, his smallest details goosing the band ahead, while his solos confirm a synthesis between form and fire. If polls had a best live concert category, Live in Kraków would garner a lot of votes.\"\nS. Victor Aaron of Something Else! stated that the trio \"epitomizes the energy, exuberance and capriciousness of most great jazz,\" and noted: \"After more than four years of developing a sixth sense, the 3dom Factor had reached the point where they're comfortable taking even more chances than before... A galvanizing performance on stage makes it three for three\" for the group.\nWriter Raul Da Gama commented: \"The term 'power trio' is the perfect one to describe the unit that creates the visceral energy which, in turn, swirls around the musical vortex created by Barry Altschul and The 3Dom Factor... It's difficult not to fall hard for a record as fine as this one.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Martin's Stew\" (Barry Altschul) – 11:46\n\"Ask Me Now\" (Thelonious Monk) – 7:28\n\"For Papa Joe, Klook, and Philly Too\" (Barry Altschul) – 10:20\n\"Irina\" (Barry Altschul) – 8:31\n\"The 3Dom Factor\" (Barry Altschul) – 13:56\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums\nJon Irabagon – tenor saxophone, sopranino saxophone\nJoe Fonda – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wymondham Town Hall is a municipal building in Middleton Street in Wymondham, a town in Norfolk, in England. The building, which is currently vacant and is being actively marketed for sale, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first town hall was a medieval structure which burnt down when a major fire swept through the town on 11 June 1615. It was replaced by a second town hall, which was deemed inadequate by the early 19th century and needed to be replaced. Like the earlier buildings, the current building was purpose-built as a town hall. It was designed in the neoclassical style, built in red brick and was completed in about 1820. The architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, noted that, despite its municipal purpose, it resembled a large town house.\nAfter the local rural sanitary authority was succeeded by Wymondham Urban District Council in 1894, the new civic leaders decided to establish their offices and meeting place within the town hall. The building continued to serve in that capacity for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when South Norfolk District Council was formed at Farthing Green House in Loddon in 1974. It was subsequently occupied by Wymondham Town Council, which leased the building from South Norfolk District Council. After links were developed with Votice in the 1990s, local dignitaries from the Czech Republic visited Wymondham and a plaque was placed on the front of the building to commemorate the relationship.\nThe town council increasingly found the town hall expensive and inefficient to operate and consequently re-located to a new building on its own land at Ketts Park in spring 2020. The town hall was then deemed surplus to requirements and South Norfolk District Council put up it for auction in 2024, with a guide price of £250,000 to £300,000.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe town hall is a three-storey building, five bays wide.  It is built of brick and has a roof of black-glazed pantiles.  There is a central doorway, with a wood panelled doorcase, and there is a semi-circular fanlight above the door.  The other bays on the ground floor and all the bays on the first and second floors are fenestrated with sash windows. At roof level, there is a modillioned cornice. Inside, there is a staircase with stick balusters and a ramped handrail, while the council chamber has a Regency fire surround. It was grade II listed in 1950.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Royal Slope is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located within Adams and Grant Counties in central Washington state. Royal Slope is the state's 15th appellation recognized by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau {TTB), Treasury on October 2, 2020, after reviewing the petition submitted by Alan Busacca, a licensed geologist and founder of Vinitas Vineyard Consultants, LLC, on behalf of the Royal Slope Wine Grower's Association, proposing the viticultural area named “Royal Slope.” The AVA lies between the Quincy Basin and Saddle Mountains surrounding the town of Royal City encompassing 156,389 acres (244 sq mi) entirely within the vast Columbia Valley AVA. There are currently 13 producing commercial vineyards cultivating approximately 14,100 acres (5,706 ha) with only one winery. According to the petition, the distinguishing features of the Royal Slope AVA are its climate, topography, geology, and soils.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to local lore, the name originated when two Scotsmen climbed the Saddle Mountains in the 1880s and observed the view to the north of the south-sloped topography and exclaimed, “Now that’s a Royal Slope!” Historically, the name “Royal Slope” is printed on USGS topographic maps of various scales since the 1950s to mark the general area. The name has been in common usage for more than 50 years to describe the rich agricultural district of tree fruit orchards, row and field crops and since the 1980s, viticulture.\n\n\n== Terroir ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe topography of the Royal Slope AVA is characterized by the gentle, south-facing slopes of an east–west trending 30 mi (48 km) range of hills called the Frenchman Hills. Slope angles are generally less than 15 percent, with very few slopes having angles of less than 3 percent. The slopes are gentle enough for agricultural purposes and are not as freeze-prone as flatter terrains such as valley floors. To the north of the AVA, the Frenchman Hills fall away to the Quincy Basin, which is a large, flat-floored valley. To the northeast are sand dunes and \"pothole\" ponds between the dune crests. To the east and south of the AVA is the Crab Creek Coulee gouged out by Missoula Floods, and on the west, the bedrock cliffs fall away steeply to the Columbia River, which has lower elevations and steeper, rockier terrain than the AVA.\nAbout 90% of Royal Slope's area consists of gently to somewhat steeply south-facing slopes. These southern slopes represent the best aspect for wine grapes in the Pacific Northwest due to the northerly latitude.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of the Royal Slope AVA is described as warm but not excessively hot, making it a suitable climate for growing a variety of red and white grape varietals, including Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, Chardonnay, and Riesling. The AVA generally has greater growing degree day (In the Winkler climate classification system, annual heat accumulation during the growing season, measured in annual growing degree days (GDDs), defines climatic regions. One GDD accumulates for each degree Fahrenheit that a day's mean temperature is above 50 °F (10 °C), the minimum temperature required for grapevine growth.) accumulations and an average cool-climate viticulture sustainability index (The cool-climate viticulture sustainability index represents the number of days between the last temperature below 29 °F (−2 °C) in the spring and the first temperature below 29 °F (−2 °C) in the fall) number than all of the surrounding regions except the regions to the south and north. The AVA also has a lower risk of vine-damaging freezes, as it generally has fewer days per year with temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) than all of the surrounding regions except the region to the south. Finally, the AVA has an average of only 9 days a year with temperatures above 95 °F (35 °C), which is fewer than the region to the south, and has fewer very hot days per year than the regions to the north, east, and west. Grape vines shut down photosynthesis at temperatures above 95 °F (35 °C), which can slow or even stop the synthesis of sugars and other ripening factors and may delay harvest.\n\n\n=== Soil ===\nThe Royal Slope AVA, like the rest of the Columbia Valley AVA, is underlain with Miocene-era basaltic bedrock and has been affected by Ice Age megafloods. Within the region of the AVA, the floodwaters followed flood channels to the east and northeast. The waters entered the region in a relatively smooth fashion, and the AVA remained largely above the floodwaters. As a result, the AVA was not heavily eroded and remained a landscape of gentle hills with deep soils suitable for cultivation. By contrast, the regions to the east and south of the AVA were eroded by fast-moving floodwaters which cut deeply into the landscape and formed the scablands of Crab Creek Coulee. Similarly strong floodwaters flowed through the region to the west of the AVA, creating the steep canyon of the Columbia River. North of the AVA, the floodwaters were smoother and gentler and deposited vast amounts of sand in what is now the Quincy Basin, creating a landscape of dunes and ‘‘pothole’’ lakes. Within the AVA, the soils are a combination of sediments from glacial floods and wind-blown post-glacial sand and silt (loess). The soils are generally deep enough for vines to extend their roots far into the soil before encountering bedrock or other impediments. The predominant soils are Aridosols, which are characterized as well-drained and low in organic material. Major soil series include Warden, Sagemoore, Adkins, and Kennewick, which together comprise approximately 59 percent of the soil in the AVA. By contrast, the regions to the east, west, and immediate south of the AVA are scablands, which have very little, if any, topsoil. Farther south of the AVA, within the established Wahluke Slope AVA, the soils are deep and fertile but are primarily Entisols, including the Quincy soil series, which comprise less than two percent of the soils in the AVA. The region to the north of the AVA is also primarily composed of Entisols, including the Quincy soil series.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nRoyal Slope AVA has the potential, situated between Wenatchee and Tri Cities and about two and half hours from Seattle, to become a popular destination within the state's growing enotourism industry. The region gained industry recognition when a Charles Smith 2006 Royal City Syrah was rated 100 points by Wine Enthusiast as the first vintage in the state to rank that high.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTTB AVA Map",

        "content": "The Llapusha-South Drenica Front (Albanian: Fronti i Llapushës dhe Drenicës Jugore; Serbian: Лапуша и фронт Јужна Дреница, romanized: Lapuša i front Južna Drenica) was fought during the Kosovo War between the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Yugoslav Army and Yugoslav Police. The Llapusha Front was in the Llapusha region and in southern Drenica of Kosovo, and lasted from late March 1998 until December 1998.\nThe 121st brigade named “Çeliku” of the KLA fought many battles against Yugoslav forces. Many battles were successful for the KLA, which led to many strategic sites being captured by the KLA. Blinaja, Fushtica, Terpeza, Bllaca, Shtëpia e Pylltarit, Ura e Sahitit, Belinc, most of southern Drenica, and most of Llapusha were all under the control of the Çeliku brigade.\nYugoslav forces launched many offensives targeting KLA strategic sites. This led to strategic sites such as Llapushnik, the Duhla Pass, Zborc, Klečka, Lužnica, and the Carraleva Gorge falling under the control of the Yugoslav army and police.\n\n\n== Yugoslav ambush on Ismet Jashari ==\nIn April 1998, Ismet Jashari was ambushed by Yugoslav forces between the villages of Volljakë and Çupevë, while he was returning to Kleçka from leading military operations in Klina and Dukagjin. Ismet Jashari survived the ambush, but was wounded in both legs.\n\n\n== Battle of Llapushnik ==\nAfter the ambush in April, Ismet Jashari with Fatmir Limaj, Isak Musliu, Ymer Alushani, and Kadri Veseli led their forces into Llapushnik, where he defeated the Yugoslav Army and police and captured the town. Ymer Alushani was killed in action.\n\n\n== Battle of Carraleva Gorge ==\nAfter occupying Llapushnik, Ismet Jashari led further operations against Yugoslav forces, defeating them in multiple battles and capturing the strategically important site of the Carraleva Gorge.\n\n\n== Battle of Duhla Pass ==\nAfter occupying Llapushnik, Ismet Jashari led further operations against Yugoslav forces, defeating them in multiple battles and capturing the strategically important site of the Duhla Pass. From the beginning of May to August 1998, Ismet Jashari reinforced strategic sites in southern Drenica, Llapushnik and the Duhla Pass for an upcoming Yugoslav Offensive.\n\n\n== Yugoslav offensive on the Carraleva Gorge, Lužnica, and the Duhla Pass ==\nOn 14 June 1998, Yugoslav forces attacked and captured the Carraleva Gorge and the Duhla Pass, held by Ismet Jashari's forces. Three days later Ismet Jashari counterattacked the VJ, who were preparing to penetrate towards Luzhnica. Ismet Jashari managed to recapture the Carraleva Gorge, forcing the VJ to withdraw back to their positions in the Duhla Pass. \n\n\n== Bllace Attack ==\nOn 25 June 1998, in Bllace, soldiers of the Çeliku brigade led by Agim Çelaj and Ismet Jashari, positioned strategically on a hill, blew up a Yugoslav BOV in Bllace. At the end of June 1998, Ismet Jashari fortified his positions in Carraleva, Zborca, Blinaja, Fushtica, Terpeza, Bllaca and everywhere in the territories, that were under the control of the KLA in south Drenica and Llapusha.\n\n\n== Major Yugoslav offensive on 25 and 26 July ==\nDuring a major Yugoslav offensive on 25 and 26 July 1998, Ismet Jashari's forces fought battles with the VJ in Llapushnik, Zborc and the Carraleva Gorge, but were not able to hold these strategic sites.\n\n\n== August KLA offensives in Shtëpia e Pylltarit, Ura e Sahitit, and Belinc ==\nIn August 1998, Ismet Jashari attacked and defeated VJ units at several occasions, such as in Shtëpia e Pylltarit, Ura e Sahitit and in the village of Belinc. \n\n\n== Battle of Lužnica and Klečka ==\nOn 23 August 1998, Yugoslav forces marched towards Kleçka, where the General Staff of the KLA was also located, but were met by Ismet Jashari's forces in Luzhnica, who held off the VJ from penetrating towards Kleçka for an entire day, while being heavily outnumbered. On 24 August 1998, the VJ had increased their offensive by attacking Ismet Jashari's forces with large-caliber cannons and surface-to-surface missiles, ultimately succeeding in driving the KLA out of Luzhnica and capturing Kleçka. One day later on 25 August, Ismet Jashari had launched a surprise counterattack in an attempt to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers. After several hours of close combat in Luzhnica, Ismet Jashari fell in battle.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Tomás Allende Alonso (20 July 1849 – 30 March 1936) was a Spanish industrialist and politician. He was one of the most important figures in the industrial development of the Province of León. He was a Deputy for Riaño and a senator for León between 1899 and 1918, and then Soria between 1918 and 1923, until the last elections of the Restoration. He was also a banker and a philanthropist.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nTomás Allende was born in Burón in the Province of León on 20 July 1849, as the son of Matías Allende and Petra Alonso. He soon settled in Bilbao, where he developed a career as an industrialist and businessman.\nAllende married María de Allende y Plágaro, and the couple had eight children, including María del Carmen, Enrique Timoteo, María, José, Enrique, Manuel de Allende y Allende, and three others. A son of his, Enrique, continued his work in these two facets, and a descendant of his, Tomás Allende y García-Baxter, was a minister during the Franco dictatorship.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis multiple interests in areas such as mining, railways, electricity production and distribution, and rural and urban property meant that in 1914, Allende was attributed \"one of the greatest fortunes in Spain\". Among the companies of which he was a shareholder, director or president of their boards of directors are: Crédito de la Unión Minera, Unión Resinera Española, Hulleras de Sabero, Minas de Cala, Electra Popular Vallisoletana, Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante (MZA), Ferrocarril La Robla-Valmaseda, Compañía Trasatlántica, Sociedad Azucarera and the Español de Crédito, Bilbao and Vizcaya banks. He was also a director of the Morro de Bilbao Mining Company, the Mineral Exploitation Company, the Sabero West Coal Company, and the Banco del Comercio.\nAllende was part of pressure groups such as the National League of Producers and the Biscayan League of Producers, whose interests he defended in Madrid's power circles. He also participated, along with the Leonese chief Fernando Merino, in several companies that were at the origin of Leonese industrialization. Between 1910 and 1917, he invested more than two million pesetas in the Spanish public debt.\n\n\n== Houses ==\nAllende also enjoyed the purchase of real estate properties, distributed mainly between Madrid, Bilbao, León, and even in his hometown of Burón, where he built a palace at the beginning of the 20th century, which served as a summer recreation home and where he enjoyed his vacations until his death. The palace was built in the style of Indian palaces, but was also inspired by the nearby Gómez de Caso palace, from the 17th century. Notably, some of the houses that he ordered to build still stand, such as one in 1916 in Madrid that is currently the headquarters of Casa Decor, an event for the best interior design in the country. The building in which all the latest developments in the world of interior design are exhibited thus had better luck than another of its original owner's properties, the Palacio de los Allende in Burón, of which only razed stones remain as silent testimony after it being destroyed by a fire in 1973, while the walls of the palace were dismantled in 1990 when the water from the Riaño reservoir was already threatening to flood Burón. Its stones were then moved to a nearby meadow with the intention of being rebuilt, something that has never come to fruition, and the last initiative for such was presented by the Board of the city in 2017, but never came to fruition neither.\nIn June 1902, Allende was awarded a special prize of 500 pesetas for \"the beautiful lighting of his house on Calle Mayor, no. 78, which featured the gallant Biscay bridge, with all its details and accessories of cables, frame, columns, supports, and with the shields of Spain on the two bases of said bridge and the portrait of his Majesty the king on the catwalk or ferry, all this in majolica, admirably executed\".\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nAllende belonged to the Conservative Party, being elected for the Leonese district of Riaño in 1896, where his son Enrique later tried his luck as well, being in office between 1905 and 1910. He continued his career in the Senate, representing the province of León between 1899 and 1918, and then Soria between 1918 and 1923, until the last elections of the Restoration.\nMember of the National Assembly created by Primo de Rivera in 1927, he stood out as a great benefactor of the province of León and, especially, of the family town of Burón, with donations of schools, nursing homes, and hospitals.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAllende died in Madrid on 30 March 1936, at the age of 86.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roscoe Emmett McGowen (July 16, 1886 – November 5, 1966) was an American journalist and sportswriter.  He spent the majority of his career as a writing for The New York Times, covering the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMcGowen was born on July 16, 1886, in Alta, Iowa.  His first job was at age 13, as a reporter and printer's devil for The Walnut Grove Banner in Illinois.  When his request for a raise was denied, he became a railroad telegrapher and dispatcher.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMcGowen resumed his journalism career with the Rock Island Argus, also in Illinois.  During that time he also made contributions to The Chicago Tribune and gained the notice of Joseph M. Patterson, who had founded the New York Daily News in 1919.  Patterson hired McGowen at The News in 1922 to write editorials and movie reviews.  McGowen moved to The Brooklyn Standard Union as a sports columnist and editor in 1928, and the following year, he joined The New York Times, where he remained for the next 30 years as a sports columnist, covering the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nDuring spring training prior to the 1934 season, McGowen asked Bill Terry, manager of the New York Giants, about the National League pennant chances of the Dodgers, their crosstown rivals, prompting the reply, \"Is Brooklyn still in the league?\" Terry and the Giants came to rue that response.  Although the Dodgers finished the season in sixth place, they beat the Giants in the last two games of the season, costing the Giants the National League pennant by one game.\nBecause McGowen's primary assignment was the Dodgers, he wrote columns for many of the team's most notable moments, including Mickey Owen's dropped third strike in Game 4 of the 1941 World Series, Jackie Robinson's first game, Cookie Lavagetto's hit that broke up Bill Bevens' near no-hitter in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series, no-hitters by Tex Carleton, Carl Erskine, and Sal Maglie, and the team's only World Series championship.\nMcGowen served as official scorer for several major league All-Star and World Series games.  He was considered one of the most authoritative baseball writers in the nation, and served as national president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1949.  He was known for his dignified manner, appearance, and speech, and could recite passages of Shakespeare at length.  He retired from The Times in 1959.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMcGowen died of lung cancer on November 5, 1966, in North Woodstock, Connecticut.  He was survived by his son Deane, who was also a sportswriter for The Times, his daughter Dorothy Farrows, his sister, and three grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Exodus lawsuits refer to planned or threatened lawsuits by Egyptian scholars and journalists aimed at receiving compensation for damages incurred by Egypt as a result of the Exodus.  The biblical Book of Exodus recounts the plagues brought upon Egypt in order to pressure Pharaoh to release the Israelites from captivity which caused considerable damage, as well as the taking of the Egyptians' gold and silver by the fleeing Israelites. \nHistorical texts attest to this being a contentious issue between Jewish community and the Egyptian community dating back to the time of Alexander the Great. In modern times, it has led several Egyptian figures to demand that either the state of Israel or \"The Jews\", in general, pay reparations to Egypt for the damages caused by the plagues or the stolen gold, or both. \nThe lawsuits have been generally viewed as legally frivolous. If treated seriously, they would potentially expose those bringing the suit to counterclaims of reparations for the slavery endured by the Israelites.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nClaims against the Jews for the taking of Exodus gold are referenced in several historical texts. Megillat Taanit mentions Egyptians who presented the claim to Alexander of Macedon who was viewed as an impartial arbiter of disputes among peoples in the territory under his control. The claim is also mentioned in Marcus Junianus Justinus’ Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus and Benno Jacob writes that these accusations are evident from responses to them in both Second Temple Pseudepigrapha and Philo.\nThe claims were notable enough that the Talmud provides a response to them, attributed to Gebiha ben Pesisa, who notes that the Hebrews endured centuries of enslavement, resulting in incalculable debt incurred by Egypt for their free labor, and implying that the gold and silver taken should be considered as less than adequate reparations for this debt. Philo also adopts this response, and views the taking as a form of mild retribution, and less than the Egyptians owed. He adds that when viewed in the context of war, taking such goods as war booty is legal.\n\n\n== Exodus gold ==\n\n\n=== Nabil Hilmi lawsuit ===\nIn 2003, Nabil Hilmi, the dean of Zagazig University's law school, announced a planned lawsuit against “all of the Jews in the world” to demand reparations for stolen gold. By his calculations, the fleeing Israelites took 300 tons of gold, whose value doubles every 20 years over 3300 years, and the amount owed should also include compound interest calculated at 5% annually over 5758 years. Given the astronomical sum that these  “1,125 trillion tons of gold\" represent, Hilmi said repayment could be made over 1000 years.\nHilmi said that he had worked with Gamil Yaken, the vice president of the Egyptian community in Switzerland, to put together a legal team to prepare the lawsuit. While most people viewed the lawsuit as either a joke  or antisemitic propaganda, Hilmi insisted he was serious in pursuing it, and according to one source, a suit was actually filed in Swiss courts. \n\n\n==== Reactions ====\nIn response, Alan Dershowitz said that if the suit ever made it to court, he would be happy to represent the Jewish side. While noting there was no chance the lawsuit would be heard in any court, Dershowitz said that if it did ever happen, it would invite a countersuit from the Jews for reparations for their enslavement in Egypt, which  could add up to trillions of dollars and also expose Egypt to lawsuits over its oppressive slavery.\nGabriel Sivan, the chairman of the Jewish Bible Association wrote that the lawsuit is \"absurd\", but if taken seriously, it would expose Hilmi and his backers to a massive countersuit that would involve compensation for slave labor of 600,000 Israelites working seven days a week for 430 years.\nCalling the suit \"ridiculous, laughable and absolute rubbish\", Beliefnet columnist Hesham Hassaballa pointed out that according to the Book of Exodus, the Israelites were operating under direct instructions from God, so the lawsuit would make God an unindicted co-conspirator.\nIn a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the planned lawsuit, The Irish Independent noted that \"Tracing the evidence at this distance in time may be problematic. The Exodus happened several thousand years ago, and just to complicate matters, the number of potential suspects, totals about 600,000.\"\n\n\n=== Ammar Ali Hassan ===\nIn 2014, political scientist Ammar Ali Hassan repeated the demand for repayment for stolen gold in an interview for Egypt's Channel 1 TV station.\n\n\n== Plague reparations ==\nIn 2014, Ahmad al-Gamal, a columnist for the Egyptian daily Al-Yawm Al-Sabi, suggested that the government of Egypt sue Israel in international courts for the damage caused by the 10 plagues. He also demanded reparations from Turkey for damage caused by the Ottoman Empire during its invasion of Egypt in the 16th century, from France for Napoleon’s invasion in 1798, and from Britain for its 72 years of occupation.\nAl-Gamal won a \"silver medal\" in the first international edition of the humorous \"Moron of the Month\" award for \"woeful decision-making\", presented by the Herald-Whig.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kyōgoku Akiyuki (京極朗徹, September 17, 1828 - May 11, 1882),  was the 7th (and final) daimyō of the Marugame Domain in Sanuki Province. He belonged to the Kyōgoku clan, which had been the ruling clan of the Marugame Domain for nine generations. .\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn on September 17, 1828, in Marugame Castle as the fifth son of Kyogoku Takachika's brother, Kyogoku Takachika. On February 23, 1844, he became the adopted son of the 6th lord, Kyogoku Takateru, and on February 25, he was welcomed as a son-in-law. On December 16, 1849, he was appointed to the position of Sado-no-suke and awarded the title of Jugo-i-shimo. Following the retirement of Takateru on March 7, 1850, he succeeded to the head of the clan. In order to rebuild the finances, measures such as issuing frugality orders to restrain extravagance, promoting industry, restricting imports, intensifying penalties for misconduct, urging the payment of tribute rice, and partially suspending the issuance of paper money have been implemented. During the turmoil of the late Edo period, actions were taken as supporters of the Imperial loyalists, frequently deploying troops to guard the Imperial Palace. In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868, when the neighboring domain of Takamatsu was designated as an enemy of the new government, the domain of Marugame, along with the domain of Tosa, were ordered by the new government to pursue Takamatsu. However, the lord of Takamatsu, Matsudaira Yoritsugu, requested mediation to the new government for his pardon, and the new government intervened to grant Yoritsugu a pardon. In February 1869, he requested the return of the family register ahead of other clans and was appointed as the governor of Marugame Domain on March 19. Afterwards, he implemented reforms such as reducing the stipends of samurai. In March 1871, he requested the abolition of feudal domains ahead of other clans, and on April 10, the Marugame Domain was abolished and became Marugame Prefecture, with Akiyuki appointed as the governor. However, he resigned as governor on August 15, just four months later, and moved to Tokyo. He died on May 11, 1882, at the age of 55. His nephew and adopted son, Kōtoku (Kyūjirō), succeeded him. In October 1868, the former Edo magistrate, Torii Yōzō, who had been under the care of the previous governor, Takahiro, was pardoned. Despite not receiving a pardon document from the Tokugawa clan, he refused to move, causing trouble for the new government and Marugame Clan. He eventually relocated to Tokyo and died in 1873.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Kyōgoku Takanori ==\n\nKyōgoku Takanori (京極高徳, November 5, 1858 - May 21, 1928), was a nobleman from the late Meiji period to the early Shōwa era in Japan. He held the title of Viscount and was ranked as Junior Fifth Rank. born as a child of Takamine Kyozen, he became the adopted son of his uncle, the Lord of Marugame Domain, Kyōgoku Akiyuki. His childhood names were Kukinosuke and Kujuro.\nHe was married to Kumiko, the daughter of Yamauchi Yukihiro. They had several children :\n\nHisako (wife of Ikeda Masatoki)\nHaruko Shunjiro (wife of Ikeda Hidemasa)\nTakako (wife of Honda Tadahisa),\nShigeko Takamasa (wife of Kawaguchi Yoshihisa),\nMasako (wife of Okazaki Masao),\nTakafumi\nTomiko\nSadame,\nMisaki Atsushi (adopted son of Misaki Kamenosuke) *Matsudaira Jo (adopted son of Matsudaira Toshiko) *Toyoko (wife of Irie Itsutsune). He studied at a prestigious school for the nobility, then served as a chamberlain at the Aoyama Imperial Palace, and later inherited the family estate when his adoptive father died in 1882. On July 8, 1884, he was ennobled as a viscount. On July 10, 1890, he assumed the position of a member of the House of Peers and held the position until his death. In 1897, he established a farm in the Wakkatasappu district of Kutchan village (now Kyogoku-cho, Abuta-gun, Hokkaido), which later became the origin of the town's name. He died at the age of 71 in 1928. The family estate was then inherited by his son, Takashi.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nMarugame Domain\nKyōgoku clan\n\n\n== References ==",

This page is a summary of delegation votes from the April 27 nominating convention in Salt Lake City.\nRandall Terry, an anti-abortion activist and 2012 presidential candidate, won the party nomination.\nStephen Broden was nominated for vice president.\nRandall Terry won the nomination by securing a majority in the first round. The votes largely broke down along geographic lines. Joel Skousen, who is from Utah, received all 61 votes from the delegations of the Four Corners states, but only 19 votes from the rest of the country combined. The only state delegations he carried outside of the region were New Hampshire and West Virginia. Paul Venable won the majority of votes from South Carolina and his home state of Missouri and Daniel Cummings won a plurality in his home state of Wyoming. The remaining ten delegations were all won by Terry. \nAside from the presidential nomination, much of the debate at the convention focused on an ultimately defeated amendment by Skousen to remove references to God from the party platform.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 United States presidential election\nPresidential primaries\n\n2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n2024 Libertarian Party presidential primaries\n2024 Green Party presidential primaries\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Telepaís is a Bolivian newscast produced by Unitel since the beginning of the network in 1997.\nIts main header is located in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (where its newscast is natively produced) and it has editions for both La Paz and Cochabamba.\n\n\n== History ==\nTelepaís created after the launch of the current Unitel network in 1997. Its first presenter was Julio Cesar Caballero La Paz, who tried to emulate the format of Carlos Mesa. However, the format failed and after a string of presenters with mixed results, José Luis Pomacusi, arrived to change its formula.\nThe initial changes began in the way it was presentered. From the previous \"talking bust\" format that showed the name of the interviewee and their position, the was now clearly described, like Telefe Noticias. Data tables, showing prices, temperature, statistics, career paths, detailed news, etc. that were read out by the presenter were now included.\nThe style of Telepaís is considered controversial by other social communicators and in its beginnings (March 2001) it was classified as sensationalist. Despite these claims, its ratings were successful thanks to the impact it had on Bolivian commercial television. Many of the creators, journalists and presenters of the early phase of Telepaís migrated to other TV networks, bringing and emulating the formula.\nIn 2001, the network covered the situation of then-president Hugo Banzer Suárez, which at the time was diagnosed with cancer and went away for health reasons to Washington DC. Unitel dispatched Karla Revollo for this end, which were later sent daily to Bolivia, as well as his later return and death. In 2002, during the flooding of La Paz on February 19, Unitel sent all available reporters to the areas where the tragedy was occurring, while other channels continued to show its normal programming.\nTelepaís is known for its exclusive reports, which are accentuated by video effects and music.\n\n\n== Presenters ==\nMariana García (Telepaís Espectáculos, 2015)\nAnabel Angus (Telepaís Espectáculos 2005–2007; main 2013–present)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism on January 27 has been a nationwide, legally established day of remembrance in Germany since 1996. It is observed on the anniversary of January 27, 1945, the day of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp and the two other Auschwitz concentration camps by the Red Army in the last year of World War II. In 2005, the United Nations declared January 27 as the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust. Since then, the day of remembrance has also been observed in many European countries.\n\n\n== Remembrance Day in Germany ==\nThe Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism commemorates all victims of an unprecedented totalitarian regime during the era of National Socialism: \"We remember the disenfranchised, the tortured, and the murdered: the European Jews, the Sinti and Roma, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the millions of abducted Slavs, the ... forced laborers, the homosexuals, the political prisoners, the sick and disabled, all those who were declared enemies and persecuted by the Nazi ideology. We also remember those who bravely resisted or offered protection and help.\"\nThe Day of Remembrance was introduced on January 3, 1996, by a proclamation of Federal President Roman Herzog and set for January 27. On January 27, 1945, soldiers of the Red Army liberated the survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the largest extermination camp of the Nazi regime.\nIn his proclamation, Herzog stated:\n\"The remembrance must not end; it must also alert future generations to be vigilant. It is therefore important to find a form of remembrance that has an impact on the future. It should express sorrow over suffering and loss, be dedicated to the memory of the victims, and counteract any risk of repetition.\"\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany, public buildings fly flags at half-mast on this day. Nationwide, the memory of the crimes of the National Socialists is kept alive through various events such as readings, theatrical performances, or religious services. Additionally, the Day of Remembrance serves to draw attention to current tendencies of antisemitism, xenophobia, and misanthropy.\nAn annual commemorative hour takes place in the Bundestag on the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism.\nSince the pericope revision of 2018, the Day of Remembrance has been part of the Protestant liturgical year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Atholl Crescent is a historic street in the city of Perth, Scotland. Established in the late 18th century, it runs, in a crescent form, for about 315 feet (96 m), from Atholl Street in the west to Charlotte Street in the east (both part of the A989 Perth Ring Road). It overlooks the southern edge of the North Inch. Thomas Hay Marshall, twice lord provost of Perth, and substantial landowner Thomas Anderson, are credited with building Perth's Georgian \"new town\" to the north and south of the medieval city centre, of which Atholl Crescent and Atholl Street were the first constructions.\nPerth developed from an initial plan of two parallel streets: South Street and High Street in the 15th century. Mill Street, to the north of High Street, followed shortly thereafter. High and South Streets became linked by several vennels leading north and south, and a couple more appeared that connected Mill Street to High Street. Kinnoull Street is the only road that connects to it throughout its quarter-mile length.\nDespite its short length, seven buildings on the street (including the central number 5) are Category A listed; one is Category B listed.\nAuthor Robert Hope Moncrieff lived at number 7 in the 19th century.\nPerth Savings Bank was based in Atholl Crescent in the mid-19th century, prior to moving to nearby 26 Tay Street.\n\n\n== Map ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Air Battle on Istrana was an air battle that took place in the sky over the town of Istrana on 26 December 1917, as part of the First World War. It was the most important air battle on the Italian front.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 25 December, an unauthorized attack on the Istrana Air Base (at the time controlled by Germans & Austro-Hungarians) was carried out by the Canadian Captain William George \"Billy\" Barker, the Aviator Harold Byron Hudson and by another pilot which remained unknown. The attack was carried out at night from the Gazzo Padovano hangar. The attack was a success: on the German and Austro-Hungarian losses, we have 15 pilots killed and 5 planes damaged.\n\n\n== Course of Events ==\nTo avenge the 25 December attack, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians jointly launched another attack on the base against what they thought were only British units. On the morning of 26 December, German and Austro-Hungarian planes attacked. The attack was described by Silvio Scaroni as the following: (in Italian) Verso le 9 di ieri mattina, dunque, le vedette del campo, dato l'allarme, avvertivano che due forti gruppi di aeroplani nemici, dalla direzione del Montello, venivano verso il nostro campo. Con un binocolo volli dare un'occhiata verso la direzione indicata e vidi subito gli apparecchi che avanzavano serrati a una quota di 3000 metri; poco più in alto un altro gruppo di piccoli caccia: complessivamente potevano essere una quarantina di macchine...After that, all the Italian and British planes stationed in the nearby Hangar joined the air battle. After bloody hours of fighting, the outcome was devastating for the Central Powers: they lost a total of 11 aircraft, while the Italians and British a total of 5. After the attack, the VI Airplane Group (later renamed 6th fighter group) received the Bronze Medal of Military Valor for the following reason: (in Italian) Durante un'incursione aerea nemica, in cui ben trenta velivoli avversari bombardavano e mitragliavano il campo di aviazione del 6º Gruppo aeroplani, tutti i piloti presenti, non scossi dalle prime perdite, si levarono in volo e con un contrattacco fulmineo ed imbattibile abbattevano ben undici apparecchi nemici, costringendo gli altri alla fuga Cielo di Fossalunga nel 26 dicembre 1917.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Soon after this marriage, the couple went abroad, and spent many years in travel, having crossed the Atlantic Ocean eighteen times. She resided in London, England, and in many cities on the European continent, chiefly in Germany and Belgium. She visited various cities of India and other parts of the Orient, afterwards returning to the West and spending some months in traveling through South America.

She subsequently made a deep study of the methods of government that prevailed in her husband's native land, where the count was a lawyer, but because of his political opinions, he had been an exile for many years.\nTo Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, the Cosmopolitan Magazine, the New York Ledger, the Independent,\" the Harper publications, the Youth's Companion. and various other leading periodicals of the U.S., Norraikow contributed many articles on the political and social conditions of the Russian Empire. In collaboration with her husband, she translated several volumes of Leo Tolstoy's short stories, which were issued by a New York publishing house. Her literary work including revising for her second husband translations which he had made of some of Tolstoy's works and that of other Russian authors. During this marriage, she signed some of her works as \"Ella Norraikow\" and others, later, as \"Countess Norraikow\". She worked on a book on the topic of \"Nihilism and the Secret Police\".\n\nHer third marriage, on October 10, 1898, in Manhattan, was to John Emery McLean (1865-1935) of New York, formerly of Orangeville, Ontario, Canada. He was an old member of the Manhattan Single Tax Club as well as a former President and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Canadian Club of that city. He also served as editor of Mind, The Arena, and The Metaphysical Magazine, all published in New York. The couple may have met through The Metaphysical Magazine or the journal's publisher as Norraikow was by then a metaphysician. After this marriage, she signed her works as \"Mrs. Ella N.

        "content": "Anna T. Lawniczak (born 1953) is an applied mathematician known for her work on complex systems including lattice gas automata, a type of cellular automaton used to model fluid dynamics. Educated in Poland and the US, she has worked in the US and Canada, where she is a professor at the University of Guelph. She is the former president of the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAfter earning a master's degree in engineering (summa cum laude) from the Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland, Lawniczak went to Southern Illinois University in the US for doctoral study in mathematics. She completed her Ph.D. in 1981, supervised by Philip J. Feinsilver.\nBefore taking her current position at the University of Guelph in 1989, Lawniczak was a professor at Louisiana State University in the US, and the University of Toronto in Canada.\nShe was president of the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society / Société Canadienne de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles (CAIMS/SCMAI) from 1997 to 2001. As president she guided a 1998 transition that included a new constitution, formal incorporation, a new annual conference, and a change from its former name, the Canadian Applied Mathematics Society / Société Canadienne de Mathématiques Appliquées.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society gave Lawniczak their Arthur Beaumont Distinguished Service Award in 2003. In the same year, the Fields Institute listed her as a Fellow in recognition of her \"outstanding contributions to the Fields Institute and its activities\".\nThe Engineering Institute of Canada named her as an EIC Fellow in 2018, after a nomination from IEEE Canada, naming her as \"an international authority in the discrete modeling & simulation methods like Individually Based Simulation Models, Agent Based Simulations, Cellular Automata and Lattice Gas Cellular Automata, a field of which she is one of the co-developers\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nAnna Lawniczak publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "The Movement for Economic Empowerment (MOVEE) is a political party in Liberia. It is a part of the Coalition for Democratic Change.\n\n\n== History ==\nMOVEE was certified by the National Elections Commission (NEC) on September 24, 2015. In September 2016, six founding members of MOVEE defected to the Alternative National Congress. They claimed to be members of an organ of the party known as the Elders Council. Among reasons cited for leaving were a lack of policy from MOVEE, as well as an allegation that the party was being ran in an unconstitutional manner. The vice chairman of MOVEE, Robert Sammy, responded, explaining there was no Elders Council, and refuted claims of unconstitutionality.\nIn August 2016, MOVEE along with 11 other opposition political parties, signed a communique in Ganta to work together against the ruling Unity Party (UP) in the 2017 general election. In the 2017, J. Mills Jones contested the presidency with MOVEE. He was a former executive at the International Monetary Fund from Sinoe County who had resigned as governor of the Central Bank of Liberia in March 2016 to run. In March 2017, a ruling by the Supreme Court of Liberia upheld a 2014 law, the National Code of Conduct, which had potential effects on the eligibility of Jones for the presidency. The law prevented presidential appointees from engaging in political activities. Specifically, canvassing votes for ones own campaign could only be done if the appointee resigned two years before the election in question. In response, MOVEE stated that Jones would be running regardless of the implications of the ruling. The NEC, in an attempt to abide by the court's ruling, initially prevented 24 candidates from running, including Jones, though later it would later overturn most of the rejections, again including Jones'.\nIn June 2017, Jones named Samuel B. Reeves Jr., pastor of Providence Baptist Church, as his running mate. The MOVEE presidential ticket received 12,854 votes, 0.8% of the total. Reeves resigned as vice standard bearer of MOVEE after the election. MOVEE blamed the Code of Conduct debacle for its poor showing and had questioned the integrity of the election. In the subsequent run-off election, MOVEE supported the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC). In the 2017 House of Representatives elections, MOVEE ran 62 candidates. Francis Saywon Young was elected in River Gee County's 2nd House district. In December 2017, the party's National Executive Committee suspended Jones indefinitely following an allegation of burglary and assault. Shortly after, Jones resigned from the party.\nIn early 2020, a convention was to be held to replace party officers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the party's functioning. The National Executive Committee in April passed a resolution making United Nations ambassador Dee Maxwell Saah Kemayah Sr., who had served as the party's chairman since March 2016, its political leader, and making Dan Saryee its chairman. In May 2020, MOVEE, along with 10 other political parties, signed a document to become part of the Rainbow Alliance (RA), with the goal of opposing the CDC in the 2023 election. The RA was certified by the NEC on August 31, 2020, with MOVEE as one of its 7 founding parties.\nBy September 2020, Kemayah had been appointed as foreign minister by President George Weah of the CDC. Before September 2022, Kemayah had been removed from the National Executive Committee. It was felt that his serving as ambassador to the UN prevented him from doing his duties in the role. He was elected as political leader again in September 2022.\nMOVEE left the RA in October 2022. In February 2023, MOVEE signed a resolution to support President Weah's bid for a second term in the 2023 election. The resolution also declared MOVEE's intent of joining the CDC. In March 2023, MOVEE, along with 5 other political parties, signed a resolution officially joining the CDC. In September 2023, football player and couch James Debbah joined MOVEE.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adolfo Sáenz-Alonso (1875 – 1964) was a Spanish professor of classical languages and sports leader. He was the first president of football club Real Sociedad between 1909 and 1912.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAdolfo Sáenz was born in 1875 in the Biscayan town of Portugalete, as the son of Álvaro Sáenz, who was a native of Logroño, but had moved to Portugalete to take up his position as a primary school teacher. In 1886, when he was 11-years-old, his father was appointed secretary of the board of public education of Biscay.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nHis professional life was initially linked to teaching, being a professor of classical languages at the University of Oñate, where he became a professor. At this university, he taught Latin, classical Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew.\nIn 1901 the university was closed and Sáenz applied for a notary position, which he obtained in San Sebastián in 1903. From that moment on, he established his residence in the capital of San Sebastian until he died, although he was a tireless traveler and also spent long periods living in Paris. It is said that Sáenz was never seen without a book in his hand.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nSáenz was a great fan of all types of sports, being a fencer. In 1906, he was one of the founders of Mundo Deportivo, Spain's first sports newspaper.\nAs a football fan, Sáenz was one of the founders of Sociedad de Football on 7 September 1909, and he was elected as the first president of the entity. A few months later, specifically on 11 February 1910, King Alfonso XIII granted the new Society the title of Real (\"Royal\"), hence becoming Real Sociedad. In October 1909, he obtained the lands of Ondarreta from the Brunete house in order to build a stadium there, which was inaugurated in 1909, and which was also the first field built specifically to play football since previously the matches were played in the interior areas of hippodromes or velodromes.\nUnder his leadership, Real Sociedad had one first year of frenetic and successful activity. On 15 October 1909, just a month after the foundation of the club, Sáenz was already speaking, in a letter sent to the City Council of San Sebastián, of the invitation issued to participate in the inaugural edition of the Pyrenees Cup held in the South of France. They went on to reach the final, which they lost 1–2 to FC Barcelona on 1 May 1910. In that same year, Sociedad, together with Madrid FC and Athletic Club, organized a parallel cup to the 1910 Copa del Rey, which is now currently recognized as official by the RFEF, in which they had to compete under a different name (since their club was not yet a year old as the tournament statutes required), doing so under the umbrella of another local club, Vasconia Sporting Club, and reached the final (UECF), which they lost 0–1 to Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of a goal from Remigio Iza. \nSociedad participated again in the 1912 Pyrenees Cup, but due to lack of funds they could not travel to Bordeaux to play the semifinal against Stade Bordelais who thus advanced on forfeit. Sáenz held the presidency of Sociedad for three years until 1912, when he was replaced by Enrique Pardiñas.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn the early 1960s, Sáenz gave an interview with the journalist José Javier Aranjuelo, next to a portrait of his son Roberto painted by Tyra Ekwall de Ullmann.\nSáenz died in 1964 in San Sebastián, at the age of either 88 or 89.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fiorinia fioriniae is a highly polyphagous scale insect and widely distributed around the world, being found in Asia, Australia/Pacific, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Its vernacular names include fiorinia scale, palm fiorinia scale, and avocado scale. It can cause significant damage to palms, avocado as well as other fruit and ornamental trees. It has been cited as one of two species of Fiorinia in a list of 43 \"principle armoured scale pests of the world\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFiorinia fioriniae has been suggested to be native to Asia, where it is found from western Asia (e.g. Turkey and Israel) to far eastern Asia (China and Japan), and from Indonesia in the south to Russia in the north. Outside Asia, it has been recorded from many tropical and subtropical countries and from greenhouses in temperate regions. The distribution range includes various Pacific Islands, parts of Australia, as well as parts of Africa and Europe, in the north up to France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. In the Americas it is widespread in the U.S., including eastern, central and western States, Central America, several Caribbean Islands and South America (Brazil, Argentina, Peru).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe scale cover of Fiorinia fioriniae is elongated, around 1.0 to 1.5 mm long, light brown, yellowish brown or orange-brown with a median, longitudinal ridge. Males have a white scale cover, but some populations like those in North America are parthenogenetic and males may be absent or very rare. Heavily infested leaves show some white wax excretion. A description of the first instar female nymphs (crawlers) has been provided together with a key to distinguish it from those of other North American Fiorinia species.\nF. fioriniae is similar morphologically to several other species of Fiorinia. In North America, it can be easily confused with Fiorinia phantasma, especially since they are both common on ornamental palms. Relevant keys need to be consulted to distinguish both species. For example, adult females of F. phantasma have an inter-antennal process which is absent in F. fioriniae.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFiorinia fioriniae is highly polyphagous, with ScaleNet listing species from 54 plant families and from 119 plant genera as hosts. The most important host plants are species of palms (various ornamental palms as well as coconut palms, date palms and sabal palms), fruit trees like avocado, citrus or mango, and a large number of ornamental trees or shrubs. The underside of the leaves are infested. The most significant damage by F. fioriniae has been reported from avocado, palm trees, tea and several ornamentals like Ruscus hypoglossum or camellias. Heavy infestations result in chlorosis and sometimes defoliation. Infestations of avocado fruits reduces their quality.\nIn tropical regions, F. fioriniae reproduces throughout the year. In cooler regions, egg laying and emergence of the first generation starts in spring. As the seasons progress, populations might overlap and there are several generations per year. As with other scale insects, dispersion occurs during the crawler stage (the first instar), as well as during human transport of host plant material. It is often intercepted by quarantine.\n\n\n== Natural enemies ==\nThere is little information on parasitoids and predators. Several species of Encarsia like Encarsia lounsburyi and Encarsia citrina have been reported as parasitoids of Fiorinia fioriniae. In addition, Aphytis chrysomphali, Pteroptrix lauri, Mymaridae and Signiphora species have been mentioned as parasitoids of F. fioriniae. Reported predators include various thrips and ladybugs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grimsby Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the Port of Grimsby, in the county of Lincolnshire. A lifeboat was first stationed here in 1882.\nWith an motor lifeboat firmly established at Humber Lifeboat Station at Spurn Point, the Grimsby lifeboat station was closed in 1927.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing difficulties in both maintaining a crew, and also with launching, the RNLI decided to close Cleethorpes lifeboat station and relocate to Grimsby, opening a new station there in January 1882. The Cleethorpes lifeboat, a 33-foot Self-righting Pulling and Sailing lifeboat (using both oars and sail), built in 1868 by Woolfe and Sons, was transferred to the station. A gift of the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity, she was named Manchester Unity. A boathouse was constructed on the north-west side of the Tidal Basin.\nOn the 7 October 1887, a new boat was provided to Grimsby, a 38-foot self-righting boat constructed by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing £624. She too was funded by the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity, and again named Manchester Unity (ON 123). Tragedy struck when the boat was called out on the evening of 18 November 1893. Coxswain Charles Barr was thrown overboard by the violent seas before the boat had even left the harbour, and was killed when he was crushed between the lifeboat and the harbour wall. The boat was sent for repairs, but was so badly damaged that she was withdrawn from service.\nA reserve boat, Reserve No.3 (ON 206) was placed on service temporarily, but was so well liked, it was made to be the permanent Grimsby lifeboat, and renamed Manchester Unity.\nIn 1898, a new Steam-class lifeboat, the James Stevens No.3 (ON 420), was sent to Grimsby for evaluation. She was over 56-feet long, had a top speed of 8½ knots, and cost £3,298. Initially a No.2 boat, she was able to cover a period from 1901 to 1903 as No.1, when Manchester Unity (ON 206) was loaned to Hull Trinity House for use at Spurn Point, whilst their regular boat was being repaired.\nManchester Unity was only back at Grimsby for a short time, before being replaced by the Charles Burton (ON 526) in 1904. A 38-foot non-self-righting Liverpool-class (P&S) lifeboat, the boat was built by Thames Ironworks, and named after her benefactor, the late Charles T. M. Burton. A new boathouse and roller slipway were constructed at the entrance to the No. 1 Fish Dock. However, by 1911, the RNLI had taken over the Humber Lifeboat Station from Hull Trinity House, and had placed a motor-powered lifeboat there in 1919. As a result, Grimsby Lifeboat Station was closed in 1927.\nIn a 45-year period, the Grimsby lifeboat had been called 40 times, and saved 19 lives. Charles Burton (ON 526) went on to serve at Caister until 1941. A busy port location, the redundant boathouses were quickly demolished, and no evidence remains today.\nIn 2023, the Humber Lifeboat Station was forced to permanently abandon their base on Spurn Point due to a failing jetty, and further coastal erosion, and relocated to Grimsby. The docks site of the current station is virtually in the same place as the 1904 boathouse. It remains to be seen if the station will one day be known as Grimsby Lifeboat Station.\n\n\n== Grimsby lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It blooms in summer.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe specific epithet litardierei honours the French botanist René Verriet de Litardière (1888–1957), famous for his studies of Corsican flora.\nStudies suggest the species is likely to derive from an ancient Sardinian-Corsican complex also including the extremely rare and geographically limited Nuragica columbine, although A. litardierei is a significantly less specialised species.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nAquilegia litardierei is endemic to Corsica, where it grows in rocky alpine habitats.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jim Smith was an association footballer who played in the 1890 FA Cup final for Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSmith, whose real surname was Clarke, started work at the Atlas & Norfolk Steel Works - originally operating in the crucible room - when he was 11 years old; he worked there for 58 years.\nHis playing career was entirely with Sheffield Wednesday, and was the first choice goalkeeper from 1884 to 1891.  The highlight - and lowlight - of his career was appearing for the club in the 1889–90 FA Cup final.  As a full-time employee and part-time footballer, Smith (along with Tom Cawley) was unable to take part in the special training for the latter stages of the competition,  He proved a stellar choice in the 2–1 semi-final win over Bolton Wanderers with one particular save just before half-time being noted, and the goal against him having a suspicion of offside.\nThe final however was a different matter.  Captain Henry Winterbottom could not play because of injury, and forward Billy Ingram was not at full fitness; opponents Blackburn Rovers took full advantage, going 4–0 up before half-time and winning 6–1, a record at the time.  Smith was blamed for the first two goals.  He did however have the consolation of a championship medal in the Football Alliance, of which Wednesday were the inaugural champions that season.  Curiously, Wednesday finished bottom in 1890–91, but finished high enough in 1891–92 to be elected to the Football League; however by the end of the latter season Smith had been displaced from goal by Allen.\nAfter retiring from the playing field, he acted as coach for the Atlas & Norfolk works sides.\nHe was a club cricketer for 30 years and an angler of some repute, winning the Sheffield works angling championship when he was 68.  He was also a member of the Burngreave Conservative Association, acting as Father Christmas in the organization's charity Christmas parties, distributing toys to poor families.  He died in 1937, survived by his widow, son, and daughter.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFA Cup\nRunner-up: 1889–90\nFootball Alliance\nChampion: 1889–90\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ernst Papanek (August 20, 1900 - August 5, 1973) was an Austrian American educational psychologist.  Born to a Jewish family in Vienna, he advocated for refugee children before and after his 1940 emigration to the United States.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nErnst Papanek was born in 1900 to a middle-class Jewish family in Vienna. His father, Johann Papanek, worked as a salesman while his mother, Rosa Papanek, worked as a tailor's assistant, in Vienna. Ernst lived with his parents and sisters Margarethe and Olga in the city's 6th district before moving to the 15th district in 1911.\nPapanek was drawn to socialist ideals at a young age, joining the Free Association of Socialist Middle School Students and participating in the January Strike of 1918. After World War I, Papanek and his high school classmates formed an organization called Playmates to support child refugees from the conflict.\nPapanek earned his high school diploma in 1919, the same year he joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party. He enrolled at the University of Vienna, but was too involved with Playmates to finish his intended medical degree. He reentered school and graduated with a philosophy degree from the university in 1927. He later studied at University of Paris and Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPapanek was elected to the City Council of Vienna in April 1932. During the same period, he served as the Municipal Council Committee for Personnel Matters and Administrative Reform, where he oversaw the city's schools and childcare facilities.\nAmidst the rise of the National Socialist party in Germany, Papanek acted as the chairman of the Austrian Socialist Workers’ Youth program, later known as the Revolutionary Socialist Youth (RSJ). \nPapnek was forced into exile following the Austrian Civil War in 1934. In Brünn (present-day Brno), Papanek and other like-minded exiles formed the Foreign Office of the Austrian Social Democrats. He also represented the RSJ at the International Union of Socialist Youth under the pseudonym Ernst Pek. \nIn 1938, Papanek became leading director of the refugee children's homes established by the Organisation pour la Santé et l'Education (OSE) in France. After the Night of the Broken Glass, the organization's scope expanded from aiding only French children to helping children in other areas escape to France. The children were evacuated after the fall of Paris in June 1940. According to Papanek's account of his time with the OSE, 140 of the 320 children were eventually rescued. \nPapanek emigrated to the United States in 1940. He assisted the Children's Aid Society as an educational consultant between 1943 and 1945.  After World War II, he served as the director of child projects for the Unitarian Service Committee.\nAfter a year as the executive director for the Brooklyn Training School for Girls, Papanek was appointed as the executive director of the Wiltwyck School for Boys in Esopus, New York in 1949.\nFrom 1958 until his death, Papanek served a professor of educational psychology at Queens College. He spent 1966 as a visiting professor at Hiroshima University.\nIn 1964, Papanek acted as the Socialist Party USA delegate to the Socialist International in Brussels. He was awarded the Golden Badge of the Association of Socialist Freedom Fighters and Victims of Fascism in 1970.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPapanek married Helene Papanek (née Goldstern) in June 1925, despite her father's resistance. The pair's first child, Gustav, was born the following year. Their second son, Georg, was born in 1931.\nIn the late 1930s, the family lived in France as Ernst and Helene worked together to house refugee Jewish children through their leadership in OSE. The family emigrated to the United States in 1940. At the time of his death, Helene and Ernst lived together in Manhattan.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nPapanek died on August 20, 1973, during a visit to Vienna. Out of the Fire, his account of his work with the OSE, was released posthumously in 1975. Coauthored by Ed Linn, the book includes correspondences with survivors Papanek aided through the conflict.\nA public housing complex in Vienna designed by Peter and Maria Tölzer is named for Papanek. Completed in 1976, the Enrst-Papanek-Hof complex features art by sculptor Alfred Kirchner and a plaque to Papanek near the entrance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nErnst Papanek papers at the New York Public Library",

        "content": "Albert de Quintana de León (5 October 1890 – 18 June 1932) was a Spanish lawyer, politician, and sports leader. Politically, he was the provincial deputy for Gerona in 1918 and 1921, and during the Second Spanish Republic, he was civil governor of Girona and deputy of ERC in the parliament in 1931 and 1932. He is best known, however, for being the first president of Girona FC from 1930 until he died in 1932.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAlbert de Quintana de León was born on 5 October 1890 in Girona into a family of agricultural owners from Torroella de Montgrí, which had several prominent members in politics, literature, and law, such as his grandfather Alberto de Quintana Combis and cousin Alberto de Quintana Vergés, also politicians, this last linked to the CEDA. During his grandfather's last term as overseas minister, he went to Cuba, where his eldest son, Pompeyo de Quintana y Serra (1858–1939), married in 1889 Flora de León y Dorticós, niece of the island's captain general and when the Quintanas returned to the Empordà, this couple had an only child: Albert.\nIn 1892, when he had just turned two years old, his mother died. Albert maintained a certain relationship with his maternal family, which included the Dukes of Hornachuelos and the Marquises of Marín, although during his childhood he rather received the political influences and literary interests of his paternal family. A family friend said years later that Albert inherited \"the finesse, culture and talent\" of the Quintanas, but that he was also \"more open, more democratic and more liberal\".\nIn 1897, his father and uncle moved to Girona to practice as lawyers. In this city, young Albert was a student at the municipal school, run by the well-known teacher and publisher Josep Dalmau i Carles, and then at the Provincial Institute. In 1907, the 17-year-old Quintana de León obtained his bachelor's degree and also in the same year, his father remarried Elisa Alemán i Cabrera. Between 1907 and 1912, he studied law at the University of Barcelona, and in 1912–13, he completed and obtained his degree at the University of Granada, taking possession of the corresponding title in April 1914.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\n\n\n=== First steps ===\nDuring his time in Barcelona, Quintana de León came into contact with republican Catalanism and particularly with Pere Coromines i Montanya, who strongly influenced him: he was a passerby in his law office, followed him at the Republican Nationalist Centre and then in the Republican Nationalist Federal Union (UFNR) and collaborated in its organ, El Poble Català during the period in which Coromines directed it. From 1910 he began to stand out for his interventions as a lecturer in political events, and in 1912, he momentarily supported the reformism of Melquíades Álvarez.\nIn 1914, Quintana de León began an intense activity as a lawyer. He often met at the Girona Court with his father and uncle, who were also practicing lawyers, and soon showed his skills as a brilliant orator. In 1916, he married Josefina Cuenca Pérez in Barcelona, with Pere Coromines as godfather. The couple, who could not have children, lived in a central apartment in Girona, which also served as a law firm.\n\n\n=== Deputy ===\nIn March 1914, Quintana de León presented himself as a republican candidate in the elections for deputies for the district of Torroella de Montgrí, which his grandfather and father had also represented years ago. In his declaration of political principles, he still presented himself as close to the reformism led by Álvarez, but he distanced himself from it by affirming his republicanism and Catalanism. Despite getting good results, he did not get the seat.\nQuintana de León later joined the Catalan Republican Party, and with this party, he was elected provincial deputy for Girona in 1918 and 1921. Between his presentation as a candidate for Courts in 1914 and his election as a provincial deputy in 1918, a political evolution followed that definitively moved him away from reformism to get close for a time to the Radical Republican Party and finally to the Catalan Republican Party, around 1918. During these years, he participated in political events with Lluís Companys, Marcelino Domingo, Francesc Layret, and Alejandro Lerroux. In the summer of 1918, he presented himself as a republican candidate in the partial provincial election that was called to fill a vacancy in La Bisbal d'Empordà district and won the election. In the provincial elections of June 1921, he repeated the election for the same district and won again, holding the position of provincial deputy of Girona until the beginning of 1924, with the governmental cessation of all deputies ordered by the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. He was a member of the Provincial Commission in the mandates of 1920–21 and 1923–24 (this one, interrupted), the second deputy secretary (1919–20) and first (1922–23) and, as such, a member of the Central Commission. As a deputy of Girona, he was also a member of the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Catalonia, in both institutions as a member of the republican minority, then the Catalanist republican, doing so in close collaboration with Josep Irla, who was also a deputy for the Bisbal d'Empordà.\nIn the Commonwealth, Quintana de León was part of several commissions, among them the one for Agriculture in 1918, as well as Culture from 1919 to 1924, and he was also a member of the governing board of the Girona Charities. As a member of the Commonwealth's Assembly, he was very active and intervened in a multitude of issues: project of the Statute of Autonomy, replacement of the provincial contingent, budgets, rejection of government repression in Barcelona, organization of the Catalan notary, creation of educational facilities, extension of sport, reorganization of charity services, tribute to Catalan volunteers in the First World War, support for Irish during its War of Independence (1919–1921), request to end the Rif War in Morocco (1920–1927).\nIn April 1923, Quintana de León presented himself as a Catalan republican candidate in the general elections for the district of Figueres, in a controversial election since he denounced before the Provincial Court the serious irregularities committed by the monarchist candidate and by the civil governor himself, but the seat was awarded to his opponent. In the same summer of 1923, he was one of the drivers of the union between various local groups of republican Catalanism, which culminated in the creation of the Partit Republicana Federal Nacionalista de les Comarques Gironines (PRFN). Quintana, Irla, and also Miquel Santaló appeared there as deputies of the Commonwealth and became part of the directory of the new party, together with other personalities of Girona's republicanism. The new party, however, soon saw its action interrupted by the arrival of the Primo de Rivera Dictatorship.\n\n\n=== Performance during the Dictatorship and the Republic ===\nDuring the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, Quintana de León had to limit his political activity and concentrate on his professional activity as a lawyer, holding the position of first deputy (vice dean) of the Girona Bar Association in 1930. In mid-1930 and taking advantage of a certain openness of the dictatorial regime, the PRFN began its reorganization, with Quintana as one of the members of the directory. He collaborated with the newspaper El Autonomista, the spokesperson for Republicanism in Girona, and when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed on 22 April 1931, he took part in the proclamation of the Republic in Girona, becoming the new civil governor of the province. However, he occupied the position for only two days, intending to contribute to a peaceful transition to the new republican regime and, once this objective was achieved, he ceased to be in office.\nQuintana de León also participated in the founding of Republican Left of Catalonia, a party with which he was elected deputy for the province of Girona in the 1931 Spanish general election. In those elections, he was part of the Republican Left Candidacy, representing the PRFN affiliated to ERC, which won an important victory. As a deputy, he was a very active member of the Left parliamentary group, making numerous parliamentary interventions and showing the constituents his skills as a speaker. He intervened in matters of interest to the constituency, such as the tariff duties established by France on the import of manufactured corks, but also in the major political reforms promoted by the Republic, which he faced from his position as a jurist. As a member of the Justice Commission, he worked thoroughly on the parliamentary processing of the Divorce Law and submitted two separate votes in this regard, which better defined the role of lawyers and the judicial process, which with nuances were incorporated into the final text.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nThroughout his life, Quintana de León collaborated in El Poble Català, La Publicitat and El Día Gráfico in Barcelona, El Autonomista in Girona, and El Sol in Madrid.\n\n\n== Social life ==\nFollowing the family path, Quintana de León intervened thoroughly in Girona's cultural life. He had several initiatives in the fields of education and culture, especially concerning the creation of new equipment and the restoration of monuments in the regions of Girona. With his wife, they attended theatrical performances, literary evenings, and musical performances. He had some literary productions, such as the theatrical arrangement of a play by Miquel de Palol. He promoted the popular auditions of Sardanas in Girona, was honorary president of the province's Orchestra Union, and had an intense activity as a lecturer in the associative network of Girona's counties.\nIn 1920 the Banc de Catalunya, which included his personal friend Pere Coromines on its board of directors, opened its branch in Girona, and Quintana went on to occupy the position of secretary of the governing council of this delegation, which was to serve as a base for him to actively intervene in its expansion in the regions of Girona between 1929 and 1930.\n\n\n== Sporting life ==\nQuintana de León was also interested in the extension of sport in Catalonia, especially from organizations with a Catalan profile; for instance, he was linked from a very young age to both the Empordà Games and the Girona Floral Games, being a member of the jury in the latter's 1920 edition and president of its council the following year.\nOn 23 July 1930, Quintana de León was one of the members of the group of enthusiasts that founded the Girona Futbol Club at the historic meeting in Cafè Norat de la Rambla, from the dissolved Unió Deportiva Girona, and he was elected as its first president. On 1 August, the City Council of Girona authorized the club to make use of the city's emblem on its badges. Under his leadership, the board agreed with the Catalan Football Federation to include Girona in the planned expansion of the second division of the Catalan championship, playing its first match against Colónia Artigas.\nThe board of directors was determined to carry out \"a sporting work from Girona, scrupulously democratic and clean of all mercantilism\". The fans, who were asked to pay an extraordinary and voluntary fee of at least 2 pesetas to \"cover the considerable expenses arising from the competition\", made it their own, which led to the renaissance of football in the city. Girona's first squad was built with the footballers linked to the old UD Girona, and three-quarters of the dressing room was from the youth team in order to reduce the import of players, who received neither salaries nor fixed bonuses, with the club only allocated a modest percentage to them at the end of each match that, according to the local press, \"were kept exemplary in a collective book of the Caixa d'Estalvis.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn June 1932, when he was only 41 years old and in full parliamentary activity, Quintana de León fell seriously ill, due to septicemia that led to meningitis. Settled in Madrid's Clínica del Rosario, he was assisted by his wife and the deputy Margarita Nelken, who were joined by his father, Pompeu de Quintana, and numerous personalities and friends, such as Miquel Santaló, Pere Coromines, and many others, but despite the efforts of the medical team, he died suddenly. At the time of his untimely death, he was preparing the defense of the Statute of Catalonia.\nHis body was transferred to Barcelona, where he received the first expressions of condolence, and then a car caravan was formed, with the president Francesc Macià, the councilor Ventura Gassol, and numerous authorities and friends, which accompanied him to Girona. In his city, a procession was formed on foot, which traveled through the streets amid popular commotion, with town halls and republican houses showing their flags at half-mast. The caravan then accompanied him to Torroella de Montgrí. He was buried in the family cemetery, in the middle of persistent rain, with the assistance of Macià, Gassol, and hundreds of friends at all times.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Order of the Golden Lily (Bosnian: Orden Zlatnog ljiljana), or simply the Golden Lily (Bosnian: Zlatni ljiljan), was a military decoration of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. It was given to soldiers and officers who displayed exceptional courage, bravery, and strategic skill during wartime.\nAlthough initially, the Golden Lily was the highest war award, on April 14, 1994, the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Decree on Decorations, which exclusively mentions the Order of the Hero of the Liberation War as the highest award.\n1,742 people were awarded the Golden Lily.\n\n\n== Award criteria ==\nThe Rulebook, established on October 1, 1992, outlines the criteria and procedures for granting the Golden Lily War award, and other relevant matters about its bestowal. According to that rulebook, the Golden Lily award was an individual as well as a collective recognition. With the adoption of the new Ordinance on awards and incentive measures in December 1992, collective awards were abolished and the only winners of collective awards are the Guards Brigade Delta and the Professional Fire Brigade Sarajevo.\nThe Order of Golden Lily was awarded to:\n\"to the members of the armed forces who particularly stood out in armed opposition to the aggressor, contributed to the expansion of the free parts of the Republic, and performed several free acts in which their courage and sacrifice came to the fore, while the aggressor suffered considerable losses in manpower and material resources\".\n\n\n== Meaning ==\nThe golden lily is a thousand-year-old symbol of Bosnia, an endemic flower characteristic to the region of Bosnia (Latin: Lilium bosniacum) which was used as a symbol of purity, innocence, and beauty. Many Bosnian heroes, from noble families to the royal Kotromanić dynasty, utilized it throughout history. Lily was also a feature of Bosnian courtyards and gardens, most often sung as zambak. A lily was also engraved on the sights of the Bosnian martyrs.\n\n\n== Bearers of the Golden Lily ==\n\n\n=== Known bearers ===\nSome of the bearers of the Golden Lily badge became known to the wider public, either during the war or later as public servants:\n\nDragan Vikić — Bosnian police officer, war veteran, former athlete, former member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the RBiH and winner of the Sixth of April Sarajevo Award;\nIzet Nanić - Brigadier General, Commander of the 505th Bužim Knight Brigade of the 5th Corps of Army of RBiH. The Golden Lily badge was awarded to him in 1994;\nNaser Orić — commander of units of the RBiH Army during the war in the Srebrenica area. He was awarded the Golden Lily badge in 1994;\nNezim Halilović Muderris — imam from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Halilović received the Golden Lily badge in 1994 as a member of the 4th Muslim Light Brigade of the 4th Corps of the ARBiH;\nSead Delić — General of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, known as one of the war commanders of the 2nd Corps of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Awarded the Golden Lily in 1995 and\nŽeljko Komšić — Bosnian politician, and member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from among the Croatian people. He received the Order of the Golden Lily in 1995 as a member of the 101st Mountain Brigade of the 1st Corps of the ARBiH.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrder of the Hero of the Liberation War\n\n\n== References ==",

He held the court rank of Jushi-i-no-ge (従四位上) and also served as Chamberlain and Left Guard Captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born on December 3, 1809, as the third son of the 6th lord, Matsudaira Yorikata, and his mother was from the Nagai clan. His childhood name was Tomosaburo. In 1797, when his half-brother and the previous lord, Yorimichi died, Yorisato succeeded him as the adopted heir. He was officially appointed in 1799. Yorisato focused on civil policies, such as establishing the domain school, Takuzendo, by appointing Yosai Sanpin, the younger brother of Kondo Atsuyama, in 1805. He also engaged in the development of Takihama Shinden and actively supported the surveying activities of Tadataka Ino. On November 25, 1832, Yorisato retired and passed on the lordship to his eldest son, Yorimasa. He died at the age of 65 on July 9, 1848. His posthumous Buddhist name was Shu Tokuin Don Jizen Hojun Nichijitsu Dai Koji. His final resting place is at the Ikegami Honmonji temple in Ota, Tokyo.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nSaijō Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brachysternus prasinus is a species of scarab beetle endemic to Chile and parts of Argentina. It was named after French entomologist Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville. B. prasinus is a species of scarab beetle in the Scarabaeidae family and is part of the Rutelinae subfamily. B. prasinus B. prasinus is the most common of all the Brachysternus species. B. prasinus is the most varied of the Brachysternus in terms of its color and type of setae, which are the hairs and bristle-like structures found on invertebrates. Due to this wide range of variability, B. prasinus have often been used in entomological studies as the species with which to compare all other Brachysternus species to. B. prasinus is green in color and is 11 to 19 mm in length. B. prasinus has light brown legs that have white hairs on them. \n\n\n== Description ==\nB. prasinus is often mistaken for the more well-known Hylamorpha elegans, also known as the San Juan beetle, which is another species native to the same habitat. It can be differentiated from other Brachysternus beetle species because they have a well-developed supraspiracular ridge on the abdomen of male B. prasinus as well as a deeply emarginate terminal sclerite which are on the legs of female B. prasinus. Additional identifiers that allow for the differentiation of B. prasinus among other related scarab beetle species include their clypeal apex (a part of the insect's head) that is weakly reflexed at its tip. Moreover B. prasinus have prothoracic legs. These prothoracic legs include femurs which are weakly rounded and dilated as well as tibia with weak pro tibial notches.\nMale and female B. prasinus differ slightly in their body shape. Male B. prasinus have the apex of the terminal sternite quadrite (a part of an insect's thorax or abdomen) whereas females are categorized as having the apex of the terminal sternite moderately to deeply emarginate. In other words, the bottoms of female B. prasinus are slightly more rounded than those of their male counterparts.\n\n\n=== Morphs ===\nThere is a large amount of variation among Brachysternus and especially in B. prasinus. Due to this large amount of variation, there are several different morphotypes of B. prasinus. As a result, there have been many different proposed names for these varied morphotypes. One morphotype is endemic to the province of Maule which encompasses Carrizalillo and Constitución, as well as the region of Talca Alto de Vilches in central Chile. This morphotype is unique from other B. prasinus due to the fact that they have more dense setose dorsally on their upper body. While these setae on B. prasinus are typically orange, in this central Chilean morphotype, the setose of B. prasinus are a darker metallic green color on the top of their body and a deeper chestnut color on the bottom part of their body. This difference is thought to be due to changes in genetics across different locations. However, it has been argued that many of these morphotypes do not differ significantly and therefore should not be categorized separately. Some argue that these differences in color and setae type are simply due to the fact that  B. prasinus have a vast range of normal phenotypes.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nBrachysternus prasinus lives on the southwestern coast of South America in Chile as well as parts of Argentina. B. prasinus lives in the area spanning from the Valparaíso region to the Magallanes Province. B. prasinus is found in Argentina in the province of Neuquén and the Río Grande Department region which is a part of the Tierra del Fuego Province. B. prasinus are seen across a wide range of elevations. They are found anywhere from elevations at sea level to 2,000 meters high in Southwestern South America. Their geographic range is highly dependent on the availability and distribution of Nothofagus, the species which B. prasinus feeds on. These forests of Nothofagus are often called Valdivian rainforests. B. prasinus have been observed in the Nothofagus forests near the cities of Coquimbo and Llanquihue in Chile as well as the areas of Neuquén and Chubut in Western Argentina.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n== Diet ==\nBrachysternus prasinus lives in Nothofagus forests. It is hypothesized that the larvae of B. prasinus feed on dead and decaying wood as well as other vegetation similar to other Ruteline larvae. Adult B. prasinus often fly at dusk to other nearby Nothofagus trees for sustenance. These Nothofagus forests consist mainly of the Nothofagus plant but also often include other plant species like: Araucaria (Araucariaceae), Saxegothaea (Pinaceae), Drimys (Winteraceae), and Chusquea (Poaceae). Most of these plant species are plentiful from the months of November to February. The Valdivian rainforest district has two types of Northofagus including the deciduous Nothofagus obliqua and Nothofagus alpina, which is also called N. nervosa.\n\n\n== Life history ==\nThere is not a significant amount of information currently known about the life cycle and stages of Brachysternus prasinus. However, B. prasinus life cycle includes the following stages: egg, pupa, larvae, and adult. The larvae of B. prasinus have been found alongside other Chilean beetle scarab species including the larvae of Hylamorpha elegans. The larvae have been known to feed on the roots of crops as well as rotting wood. The larvae appear white in color with a dark chestnut colored head. The abdomen area of the larvae is also slightly darker. There is not much known about the pupal stage of B. prasinus. These beetles have an annual life cycle like many other scarab beetles. They are thought to be in the larval stage from January to around the month of November. The pupal stage is thought to span sometime between September and November. Finally, the adult stage lasts from approximately the month of November to February.\n\n\n=== Flight ===\nAdult B. prasinus often fly at dusk to nearby Nothofagus trees for sustenance. It has been observed that the peak flight season for Brachysternus prasinus is at the end of December. Adult B. prasinus are attracted to lights at night and have been captured while flying by shining lights in the darkness. \n\n\n=== Olfaction ===\nThe species is highly dependent on different olfactory cues in its environment. B. prasinus utilize chemoreception, which is the process which allows organisms to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli, especially through smells and tastes. This chemoreception is carried out by odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs). These different receptors relate to key proteins in the chemical ecology of these insects and can provide information on the evolutionary processes of scarab beetle species like B. prasinus. Scientists have used relative levels of ORs, IRs, and GRs to analyze the relations of different Scarabaeidae including B. prasinus. Additionally, it has been found that there is a sizable sex-biased expression in different ORs in B. prasinus. In other words, male and female B. prasinus have differing levels of specific ORs which likely provides important information on the behavior and reproductive habits of the species; however, more data is needed on the subject. It has also been suggested that ORs play a role in detecting plant volatiles, a process that is crucial to the feeding habits of insects like B. prasinus.\nOlfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in scarab beetles like Brachysternus prasinus and Hylamorpha elegans are key to detection of different smells as well. ORNs are specifically tuned to recognize enantiomeric pheromones. Additionally, pheromone-degrading enzymes are present in the antenna of scarab beetles. These enzymes show high substrate specificity which is thought to allow these beetles to deactivate certain pheromones and odorants but not others. These pheromones and pheromone-degrading enzymes are key to the chemical communication of scarab beetles, about which not much is currently known.\n\n\n== Interactions with humans and livestock ==\n\n\n=== Pest of crop plants ===\nBrachysternus prasinus are part of the family Scarabaeidae, which is a highly diverse family but many of these insects have become considered pests to farmers and scientists. B. prasinus are viewed as subterranean pests. These beetles can cause damage through their laval feeding habits on the roots of crops as well as adult feedings on the above ground portions of plants. As a result, B. prasinus are important in regard to South American agriculture as well as the Chilean economy. B. prasinus have been known to cause immense damage to crops of wheat, especially Triticum aestivum, as well as red clover (Trifolium pratense). These pests have been difficult for farmers and agriculturalists to control because it is hard to determine larval positions in the soil. Additionally, it is difficult to predict the activity of these beetles at night. Several different possible solutions have been proposed to diminish the effects of these beetle pests on crop outputs including chemical and biological controls. Chemical control entails using specific chemicals as pest repellent. Biological control entails the manipulation of different pathogens and sex pheromones of scarabs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Emma Bullet (1842 – January 31, 1914) was a French-born American journalist, the Paris correspondent of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle for 32 years. She also taught school in Ohio, and was a canteen worker during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBullet was born in Belfort, France and moved the United States at age 7. Her mother was a French teacher.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBullet taught French at the Ohio Female College in Cincinnati and at a school in Paris as a young woman. She and her mother ran a \"coffee shack\" on Montmartre during the Franco-Prussian War. \nFrom 1879 to 1882 Bullet wrote for the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette. In 1882 she became the \"graphic, unconventional, breezy\" Paris correspondent of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a role she held for 32 years. She reported on Parisian fashion, and from Queen Victoria's jubilee in London in 1897. She interviewed William Jennings Bryan in 1906. In 1907, the newspaper published her autobiography in serial format, and in 1908 published it as a special pamphlet, in observance of her 30th year as their Paris correspondent, and she was honored at a dinner in Brooklyn by her colleagues at the Eagle. She was a member of the Paris Press Club.\nBullet's home in Paris was described as a weekly \"salon\" frequented by \"the leaders in the world of literature, art, and music in Paris\", especially Americans such as sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies and opera singer Emma Nevada. She was \"one of the best known and most representative of American women in Paris,\" according to an 1893 profile. \n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Emma Bullet's Budget from Paris\" (1900)\n\"A Letter from Abroad\" (1911)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBullet was in the United States for several months in 1908, and stayed with her sister Marie in Maine, New York, and Ohio. Her sister was married to music critic Henry Edward Krehbiel. She died in 1914, at her home in Paris, in her seventies. \"She combined an understanding of America and the Americans with a sureness and keenness of perception which made her letters from the French capital authoritative, comprehensive and interesting,\" commented the Brooklyn Times at the time of her death.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anacleto's Rebellion or Nicaraguan Civil War It was a rebellion led by José Anacleto Ordóñez, a Nicaraguan soldier, merchant, and nationalist who opposed Mexican rule over Nicaragua, launched a rebellion against the pro-Mexican government\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn December 1811, armed uprisings led by Creoles dissatisfied with colonial dependence and control broke out in León, Masaya, Granada and Rivas.  They were suffocated.  The Creole opportunists availed themselves of the Captain General's pardon.  The rebels in Granada resisted until April 21, 1812, when some rebels of aristocratic origin made an agreement with the authorities that did not save them from prison.\nOrdoñez returns to Granada\nBetween 1812 and 1820 Ordoñez returned to Granada where he maintained a life linked to the people, gaining appreciation for his willingness to serve.  In Mosquitia he acquired knowledge about the healing properties of plants, which is why many needy patients turned to him as a “herbalist doctor.”\n\n\n== The rebellion ==\nJosé Anacleto Ordóñez started the rebellion against the pro-Mexican government on January 16, 1823. He and his supporters bloodlessly captured the military barracks in Granada.  This was followed by a series of looting and robberies by Ordóñez supporters in the cities of Granada, Jinotepe, Juigalpa and Masaya.  The violence caused many in the affected cities to flee to Managua, which remained under the control of pro-Mexican forces.\nOn February 13, 1823, the troops of Brigadier Miguel González Saravia (Cartagena, 1788 – Madrid, 1848), former governor of Nicaragua (1819–20), were repelled -despite the superiority-, by popular resistance and skill. of the Granada leader.On February 23, 1823, Nicaraguan governor Miguel Miguel González Saravia y Colarte (who had been the last Spanish governor of Nicaragua) [26] forcibly recovered Granada with an army of 1,000 soldiers. The imperialists requested reinforcements from the Mexican army under the command of General Vicente Filísola (Naples, 1789 – Mexico, 1850), but, on March 19, Iturbide abdicated, collapsing the ephemeral empire.\nCleto established himself as a popular leader.  He managed to unify the political wills of León and Granada.  A Patriotic Junta was formed made up of progressive elements of the middle classes and some liberal Creoles who supported it, “abolished the testamentary law, as well as the titles, treatments and privileges of the Creole aristocracy,” and shouted: “The gifts are over!”\nCleto's actions became widespread in Nicaragua and other cities in Central America.  Social contradictions emerged;  In mid-1824 the popular forces controlled León and Granada.  The Creole aristocracy and the old peninsular officials were concentrated: those of León in El Viejo, and those of Granada in Managua (named Leal Villa de Santiago de Managua by Royal decree of Fernando VII in 1819 for having maintained fidelity to the monarchy by not revolting. as did León, Granada and others) where they created parallel government boards (that of Managua chaired by Policarpo Irigoyen – priest and judge of Managua since 1813; he was in Guatemala in 1823 with Bishop García, returning in 1824 until his death in 1829 -, Cleto's father's brother) and appointed military leaders: Crisanto Sacasa in Managua and the Peruvian mercenary Colonel Juan José Salas in El Viejo, with the support of Bishop Nicolás García Jerez.  Faced with the anti-popular involvement of Policarpo, the bishop and others such as the parish priest of San Carlos who facilitated the Sacasa escape, this revolutionary struggle also had an anticlerical component.\nIn 1824 Sacasa failed twice in the attempt to take Granada, while his troops had low morale, those who defended the city showed a high commitment motivated by their leader.\nIntervention by Manuel Arce\nFaced with the complex situation, Gen. Manuel José Arce (San Salvador, 1787 – 1847) was sent as a peacemaker and arrived in León on January 9, 1825. Sacasa had died in a failed attack on León and Salas had deserted.  Arce's intervention mediated the popular conquest in the main cities;  He sought to “install a formal democracy and modernize the system of exploitation.” He imposed a solution to flatter everyone: he appointed Cleto Ordoñez to the honorable position of Inspector General of Weapons of the Federal Republic, removing him from the Nicaraguan scene.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:History of Central America\nCategory:History of Nicaragua\nCentral America under Mexican rule\nJosé Anacleto Ordóñez\nManuel Arzú\nManuel José Arce\nMiguel González Saravia y Colarte\n\n\n== References ==\n\n[1]",

He graduated from the Conservatory of Fribourg in 1987, in 2001 — from The Film & Photographic Workshop Rockport, Maine. In 1988, he started working at the Italian-language Swiss Radio Rete. Ten years later, he moved to Swiss Television and hosted experimental programmes, at the same time working as a critic and a writer.\nIn 2004, he founded a production company Venus and beyond and created his first documentary, Nocaut (2004), which was presented during the Semaine de la critique of the Locarno Film Festival.\nHis third documentary, Hugo en Afrique, was released in 2009. An homage to Hugo Pratt, it was selected for the Horizons competition at the Venice Film Festival and won Bisato d'Oro for Best Director by the independent jury of film critics. \nIn 2017, he released Quand j'étais Cloclo, a tragicomic story of his family.\nKnuchel is the director of Locarno Filmmakers Academy and the founder of BaseCamp, an educational initiative for emerging filmmakers.\nIn 2021, Knuchel presented Hugo in Argentina at the Venice Film Festival and was screened at numerous film festivals. The film covers Pratt's Argentine years: landed in Buenos Aires in 1950, Pratt was dreaming about the United States, but fell in love with Argentina and remained there, overwhelmed with its vibrance.\nIn 2022, Knuchel announced working on the third film about Hugo Pratt, Hugo in Venice.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n2022 — Dawn Chorus (writer)\n2021 — Hugo in Argentina\n2017 — Quand j'étais Cloclo\n2009 — Hugo en Afrique\n2005 — Paint Me a Life\n2004 — Nocaut\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Automation Technology Products (ATP), later renamed Cimplex Corporation, was a Computer Integrated Manufacturing software company founded in 1983 in Campbell, CA, USA.\n\n\n== Background ==\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software applications were traditionally based on 3D modeling technology. Models were generally created by entering \"wireframe\" details by describing lines, curves, intersections, edges, vertices etc., or by defining a complex curve or surface with a mathematical formula. Solid modeling described objects in terms of their solid geometry and topology, combining basic objects such as cubes, spheres, cones and so on by adding two or more together or subtracting objects from another simple or constructed object. One of the first was the Romulus (modelling kernel) system released by a team in Cambridge, England in 1978. Automation Technology Products established a team, consisting of experienced mathematicians, engineers and programmers, to produce a system that could not only model mechanical objects but automatically generate and perform Finite Element Mesh calculations to verify the strength of the design and generate Numerical Control (NC) programs to machine finished objects to very high tolerances. They achieved their goal and released a product named CIMPLEX in 1985.\n\n\n== Challenges ==\nThe mathematics involved in solid modeling is extremely complex and there were many unsolved problems, such as computing intersections between objects to an accuracy of 1/10,000th. of an inch for aerospace part manufacturing. The descriptions of even solid simple models involved a lot of data objects and connections between them. There had been attempts to use CODASYL Database technology in commercial products, but none had been able to attain the performance required to perform calculations on the model in acceptable time. A simple cube, for instance, can be represented by 65 interconnected objects, such as vertices, lines, edges, co-edges, loops and so on. An automative engine design required tens of thousands of data objects and connections and the resulting finite element meshes had tens of millions. Only mainframe computers and supercomputers  of the time could perform the calculations quickly enough and handle the massive throughput of randomly accessed data involved. Although there were standalone workstations with color graphics displays, they were inadequate for handling all of the tasks involved.\n\n\n== Solutions ==\nThe team came up with many novel and innovative solutions to the mathematical problems and CIMPLEX was used for modeling automative, nautical and aerospace parts, including aircraft doors, composite wings, engine blocks, submarine nacelles and helicopter gearbox parts.\nThe software team decided to use IBM 370 mainframes for the computations and database handling and Silicon Graphics (SGI) displays and workstations for visualization. They also developed advanced database software, called ATPID (ATP Interactive Database) and a modeling and control language, ATPL, for handling interactions and repetitive tasks. ATPID had many interesting features, including the ability to construct and manipulate compound data structures, such as lists, many to many relationships between objects and versioning of objects and structures.\nInteraction between the computing and database elements on the mainframe and the graphics appearing on the workstations was handled by a database to graphics engine protocol and a proprietary IBM mainframe to SGI workstation communications technology. Updates to the mainframe database or workstation display raised trigger events that caused updates to the display list or database.\n\n\n== CIMPLEX Applications ==\n\n\n== Factory Automation Information Management (FAIM) ==\nThe first CIMPLEX product, Factory Automation Information Management (FAIM), was released in 1984. It was deployed by companies such as Sikorsky and Ingersoll Machine Tools for product configuration management. It allowed users to produce a schema of data definitions and to enter, update, delete and query complex structures of data objects and their relationships. A later version allowed them to provide their own graphical user interface panels for Personal Computer users.\n\n\n== Solid Modeller ==\nThe CIMPLEX Solid Modeler Subsystem used the SGI graphics terminal or workstation to manipulate, rotate, explore details and query designs. it used patented rendering technology and was capable of displaying shaded and reflective surfaces.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe CIMPLEX Analysis Subsystem could automatically generate Finite Element Meshes to any level of detail, including alternative versions, then invoke the NASTRAN or  stress analysis application to check the viability of a designed object being subjected to specified stresses and strains.\n\n\n== Manufacturing ==\nThe CIMPLEX Manufacturing Subsystem could be instructed to use specified materials (stock) and cutters to produce a Numerical Control program that could then be delivered to a milling machine for manufacturing the designed object from of metal, foam or composite material stock.\n\n\n== Numerical Control Verification (NCV) ==\nAs graphical workstations became more powerful and less expensive, NCV, a user-friendly application for verifying and adjusting numerical control programs, was created. It could take a file of numerical control instructions written in APT (programming language), whether or not it was generated by CIMPLEX, depict the initial material stock and a profile of the finished part, then show the cutter paths and the resulting partially formed and completed shapes. It could also flag potential problems, such as chafing or tool over-stressing.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hovvdy is the fifth studio album by American duo Hovvdy, released on April 26, 2024, through Arts & Crafts Productions. It received acclaim from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nHovvdy received a score of 85 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on four critics' reviews, which the website categorised as \"universal acclaim\". Caleb Campbell of The Line of Best Fit wrote that the album \"feels like a very intentional turning of the page\" from their previous album True Love (2021), as it is \"dotted with skittering drum machines, keening pedal steel, and simmering synths\" and \"trying to draw out moments of catharsis or festival-ready melody\". Paste's Ellen Johnson felt that the duo \"turn to some heavier fare\" on the album, which \"pack[s] as much of a punch as anything they've ever released, all while never sacrificing the earmarks of the experimental Hovvdy sound\".\nReviewing the album for Spin, Margaret Farrell wrote that Hovvdy \"houses their most eclectic transitions and banger-certified pop songs\", calling it \"a microscopic photo album of their inner values at work\". Daniel Gard'ner of Under the Radar called the album \"an expansion of the band's aesthetic, a broadening of scope that matches the evolving complexity of their lives\" as \"their hushed, intimate storytelling is given the required space to slowly unwind and cast a quiet spell\". In a Highly Recommended review for Chorus.fm, Aaron Mook noted that in between the singles, the album was a \"largely subdued collection with quiet, introspective moments inspired by songwriters like Bruce Springsteen, Randy Newman, and Jeff Tweedy,\" concluding that \"Hovvdy are talented and ambitious enough to throw everything but the kitchen sink into their songwriting process and still arrive with a statement piece that feels like their least immediate in years, but their most rewarding album to date.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nHovvdy\n\nCharlie Martin – performance, production\nWill Taylor – performance, production\nAdditional contributors\n\nBennett Littlejohn – performance, production, mixing\nAndrew Sarlo – performance, production\nSimon Lancelot – mastering\nAndy Gross – additional engineering\nAdam Alonzo – art direction, photography\nBradley Pinkerton – design, layout\nTaylor Clark – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The forty-second series of the British medical drama television series Casualty, titled Breaking Point, began airing on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024. The series focuses on the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at the emergency department (ED) of the fictional Holby City Hospital. Jon Sen and Liza Mellody continued their roles as executive producer and series producer respectively. Breaking Point is the fifth series of the shorter narrative arcs introduced by Sen.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe series commenced in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2024 on BBC One, one week after the forty-first series ended. It is produced by BBC Studios. The series received a promotional trailer on 20 March 2024.\nJon Sen continues his role as executive producer; his resignation was announced in October 2023. Kate Oates, the head of continuing drama at BBC Studios, expressed sadness at Sen's decision but accredited him with \"creating some groundbreaking moments\". Roxanne Harvey was announced as his successor in November 2023. Harvey looked forward to creating \"distinctive, addictive characters alongside ambitious, emotionally epic stories that reflect our modern day NHS\". Filming for Casualty primarily takes place in a purpose-built studio at the BBC Roath Lock Studios in Cardiff, although the nature of the show means that filming also takes place on-location. On-location filming often occurs in Cardiff and other areas of southern Wales.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBreaking Point features a cast of characters working for the NHS within the emergency department of Holby City Hospital and the Holby Ambulance Service. Most cast members from the previous series reprise their roles in this series. William Beck appears as Dylan Keogh, a consultant in emergency medicine. Di Botcher portrays Jan Jenning, the operational duty manager at Holby Ambulance Service. Anna Chell stars as Jodie Whyte, a staff nurse, and Milo Clarke plays Teddy Gowan, a paramedic. Nigel Harman features as consultant Max Cristie, the department's clinical lead. Shalisha James-Davis plays Paige Allcott, an F1 doctor, and Elinor Lawless stars as consultant Stevie Nash. Kirsty Mitchell portrays Faith Cadogan, an advanced clinical practitioner (ACP), and Neet Mohan appears as Rash Masum, a clinical fellow. Eddie-Joe Robinson and Sarah Seggari play staff nurses Ryan Firth and Rida Amaan, respectively. Arin Smethurst and Michael Stevenson feature as paramedics Sah Brockner and Iain Dean, respectively. Charles Venn portrays paramedic Jacob Masters, and Barney Walsh plays staff nurse Cameron Mickelthwaite.\nOn 7 February 2024, it was announced that three new characters would join the series. Alongside Manpreet Bachu, who debuted in the previous series as Tariq Hussein, Jamie Glover was cast in the role of Patrick Onley, a trauma surgeon and the department's clinical lead. He was excited about joining the show and to work with \"such a dedicated, skilful group of people\". Sammy T. Dobson joins the show as junior doctor Nicole Piper, respectively. Dobson commented that \"to become a piece of such a well-regarded part of BBC history is incredible\". Patrick appears from episode 1, and Nicole from episode 2.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDigital Spy's Erin Zammitt praised the Breaking Point series, and the story arc format as a whole for the depths it allows themes to be explored. Zammitt described the series' focus on staff mental health as \"important television\", relating this to the struggles faced by real NHS workers. She compliment the focus on Rash and Neet Mohan's performance, as well as the story's efforts to follow Rash's journey beyond his breakdown and the series' awareness of systemic failures. Zammitt also noted the impact of the series showing Dylan's struggles, due to audiences having known him as \"confident and focused\" for more than ten years on-screen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBreaking Point at BBC Online\nBreaking Point at the IMDb",

        "content": "The fortieth series of the British medical drama television series Casualty, titled Driving Force, began airing on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023. The series focuses on the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at the emergency department (ED) of the fictional Holby City Hospital. Jon Sen continues his role as the executive producer and Liza Mellody continues as series producer. Driving Force is the third series of the shorter narrative arcs introduced by Sen.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe series commenced in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023 on BBC One, a week after the conclusion of the thirty-ninth series. It is produced by BBC Studios. Jon Sen continues his role as executive producer. Liza Mellody serves as series producer. Filming for Casualty primarily takes place in a purpose-built studio at the BBC Roath Lock Studios in Cardiff, although the nature of the show means that filming also takes place on-location. On-location filming often occurs in Cardiff and other areas of southern Wales.\nDriving Force was initially promoted under the previous series structure, with series 38 commencing from the episode \"Aftermath\", but was subsequently recategorised to align with the story arc format.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJaye Jacobs departed the series in episode 10 at the conclusion of her character's story. Her departure had not been announced prior to transmission. The following episode features the exit of Robert Pugh when his character Gethin kills himself.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDriving Force at BBC Online\nDriving Force at the IMDb",

        "content": "The thirty-ninth series of the British medical drama television series Casualty, titled Welcome to the Warzone, began airing on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2023. The series focuses on the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at the emergency department (ED) of the fictional Holby City Hospital. Jon Sen continues his role as the executive producer and Liza Mellody continues as series producer. Welcome to the Warzone is the second series of the shorter narrative arcs introduced by Sen, and focuses on the arrival of four new nurses to the ED.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe series commenced in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2023 on BBC One, a week after the conclusion of the thirty-eighth series. It is produced by BBC Studios. Jon Sen continues his role as executive producer. Filming for Casualty primarily takes place in a purpose-built studio at the BBC Roath Lock Studios in Cardiff, although the nature of the show means that filming also takes place on-location. On-location filming often occurs in Cardiff and other areas of southern Wales.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nOn 23 March 2023, it was announced that Jaye Jacobs would reprise her role as nurse Donna Jackson, joining the regular cast as a senior sister/clinical nurse manager. Jacobs had previously portrayed the character for 13 years on spin-off series Holby City until its cancellation, and had also previously guest starred on Casualty on multiple occasions. The actress expressed her joy at joining the drama. Donna returns in the first episode of the series. Davood Ghadami also reprised his Holby City role as surgeon Eli Ebrahimi in episode 13.\nAs part of the mini-series, four new nurses were introduced. This concept was first mentioned in November 2022. The characters and their casting details were announced on 23 March 2023. Barney Walsh was cast as \"accident prone\" Cameron who is billed as \"a perpetually terrified fish out of water\". Walsh expressed his joy at working on the drama. Anna Chell joins the cast as \"quick-witted and outgoing\" Jodie, whose backstory will be explored. Chell described Jodie as a \"joy to play\" and looked forward to her exploring her further. Sarah Seggari was introduced as \"straight-talking and confident\" Rida, who is the first hijab-wearing Muslim on the drama. Seggari noted that although Rida appears \"abrasive\", she is a carer \"at her core\". Eddie-Joe Robinson debuted as \"ambitious and glory-hungry\" Ryan, who struggles with the difference between school and working in the ED. Robinson called his casting \"a fantastic experience\" and dubbed Ryan a \"cocky\" nurse who is \"a little misunderstood\". Sen called the new nursing characters \"a breath of fresh air\" and hoped the audience would like them. The characters make their debut in the first episode of the series.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWelcome to the Warzone at BBC Online\nWelcome to the Warzone at the IMDb",

        "content": "Mohamed Haidar Sayed El Heiny (Egyptian Arabic: محمد حيدر محمد السيد الحيني; 10 December 1887 – 1 October 1957) was an Egyptian military officer and politician. Haidar Pasha served in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and played a leading role in the Egyptian politics before the 1952 Revolution, especially in King Farouk's reign. He was appointed Minister for War by King Farouk. Haidar Pasha was also the 4th president of Zamalek SC, he is the longest serving president in the history of the club.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMohammed Haidar was born in Abwan, Matai, El-Minya on 11 February 1887. He was sharp and honest. The Egyptian Military leader Ahmed Orabi, was his role model. He joined the Egyptian Military Academy, he was known among his colleagues and superiors for his precision, discipline, good morals, and seriousness. He graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1909, and was the first in his class in the cavalry. He was commissioned into the Egyptian Army in 1910.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nIn 1917, Haidar Pasha was appointed commander of the Sawari police station in Cairo. In 1934, he was appointed head of the Prison Service, and army officers were allowed to hold this position. He traveled as Emir of Hajj in 1942, accompanied by the Kaaba kiswah.\n\nHaider Pasha took over the Ministry of War in 1947 within the government of Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha. Haidar Pasha served as Minister of War in the coalition ministry headed by Hussein Sirri Pasha in 1949, and remained in office until Hussein Siri returned again and formed a neutral ministry on 3 November 1949.\nWhen the elections were held and the Ministry of Hussein Sirri Pasha resigned during the era of Mostafa El-Nahas Pasha, the Serail insisted on appointing Haider Pasha as Minister of War. He was a prison officer with no military experience, but El-Nahas Pasha refused, and this was met with Royal Decree No. 13 of 1948 appointing him as Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces, the first to assume this position after its establishment.\n\nAfter his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Haider Pasha found the poor morale of the officers, and he demanded from the King a promotion for the officers, and the king agreed. Haidar Pasha was close to King Farouk, however, Haidar Pasha was aware of the plot of the Coup d'état that led to the 1952 Revolution and the overthrow of the king, but didn't warn the king. Haidar pasha was Abdel Hakim Amer's uncle, Amer was one of the free officers movement. He returned Anwar Sadat back to the army after he was discharged. After 1952, Haidar Pasha was untouchable, he lived peacefully in his hometown in Minya, even the free officers including Gamal Abdel Nasser went to meet him led by Mohamed Naguib himself.\n\n\n== Sports career ==\nHaidar Pasha was a Zamalek fan, he loved that Zamalek used to win British football teams, the club became specialized in defeating them. It included distinguished players at that time, such as Hussein Hegazy, El-Sayed Abaza, Mokhtar Fawzi, Tewfik Abdullah, and others. The team played in the final of the Sultan Hussein Cup in 1921 against the Sherwoods. Zamalek won 2–1, and the two goals were scored by El-Sayed Abaza and Hussein Hegazy.\n\nIn 1923, the intensity of the dispute between the Egyptian members of Zamalek and the foreign members was escalating. The members asked Youssef Mohamed to search for an Egyptian president for the club, and the members decided to hold a general assembly for the club to choose a new president, and the number of members of the assembly was thirty five members, and the Egyptian members learned that foreigners intended to seize the club. On the night of the General Assembly, the Egyptian members decided to guard the club with arrows and sticks, and the atmosphere was threatening to explode. The matter ended with the election of Mohammed Haider Pasha as president of the Zamalek Club.Haidar Pasha headed the Egyptian Football Association in 1937, he remained in charge of the association until 1944, when Fouad Serageddin took over the presidency. In 1945 Haidar Pasha returned to office and remained until 1952. He headed the club for twenty nine years, Haidar Pasha is the longest serving president in the history of Zamalek. The club had achieved major successes in his era. He loved the club and the players as family. He used to interfere in choosing players for the team, he discovered dozens of players who became stars of the Egyptian football.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHaidar Pasha died on 1 October 1957, at the age of 70. A military funeral was held from the Omar Makram Mosque, Tahrir Square, Cairo. The funeral was attended by the entire Revolutionary Command Council including Major General Abdel Hakim Amer, the Minister of War at that time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Egyptians\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ADCK1 (aarF domain containing kinase 1) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ADCK1 gene. It is situated on chromosome 14 at the q24.3 location.\n\n\n== Function ==\nADCK1 is predicted to possess ATP binding activity and protein serine/threonine kinase activity. It is involved in the negative regulation of mitochondrial fusion and the positive regulation of cristae formation within mitochondria. The protein is thought to be located predominantly in the mitochondrial inner membrane and may act as an integral component of the mitochondrial membrane.\n\n\n== Genomic context ==\nThe ADCK1 gene is located on chromosome 14q24.3. The genomic sequence spans 134,905 base pairs from 77,800,109 to 77,935,014 on the GRCh38.p14 primary assembly. It consists of 17 exons.\n\n\n== Expression ==\nADCK1 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the brain and thyroid, among others.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nResearch indicates that ADCK1 may have therapeutic implications in diseases such as osteosarcoma and colon cancer. It has been observed to activate the beta-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, to promote the growth and migration of cancer cells.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Otto Oppenheimer (born 10 February, 1965) is a Puerto Rican television personality. Oppenheimer, who dedicates himself to inform viewers about technology on television, has spent more than 40 years on Puerto Rican television. Since 2022, he has been featured on Telenoticias en Accion, a Telemundo Puerto Rico news show. He is the host of a segment named \"Ottotecnologia\" on that show.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOppenheimer is a native of the northwestern Puerto Rican city of Aguadilla. At the young age of 14, he became a television show host and producer, on  a locally produced television musical show named \"Imagen y Sonido\", which was televised from Aguadilla on a television station named WOLE-TV.\nA few years later, Oppenheimer went to study at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, where he intended to study engineering. But Oppenheimer soon discovered that he really enjoyed communications better, so he transferred to the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in Santurce, a ward of San Juan, instead.\n\n\n== WAPA-TV ==\nDuring the early 1980s, Oppenheimer joined canal 4, a Puerto Rican television channel. He participated at various television shows during his 40-year tenure at Canal 4, usually presenting new technologies and technological advances to the television viewing public.\nEventually, Oppenheimer landed a spot on WAPA-TV's (by now known as \"Televicentro Puerto Rico\") midday variety show, \"Pegate al Mediodia\". This spot was named \"Tecnologia con Otto\".\n\n\n== Telemundo Puerto Rico ==\nIn 2022, it was announced that Oppenheimer was moving to Televicentro's main competitor, Telemundo Puerto Rico, to participate on their news show, \"Telenoticias en Accion\", with a segment named \"Ottotecnologia\" (\"Otto's Technology\") \n\n\n== Style ==\nOppenheimer is known for his comedic, sometimes irreverent style of informing. On one instance during his days at Televicentro Puerto Rico, he made a joke using the name of his then co-host, the late reporter Keylla Hernandez. Hernandez showed discomfort at the joke, which was shown on Kobbo Santarrosa's gossip show, \"SuperXclusivo\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Puerto Ricans\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "JZD Slušovice, later renamed Društevní agrokombinát Slušovice and Zemědělské obchodní družstvo FORUM was a unified agricultural cooperative in Slušovice in Czechoslovakia, which became famous for its success as a \"socialist miracle\". After 1989, the cooperative's assets spilled over into more than 101 companies, most of which went bankrupt. The cooperative itself ended up in liquidation and subsequently in bankruptcy with debts of 5.768 billion CZK.\n\n\n== History ==\nJZD Slušovice was founded in 1952. Since 1963, František Čuba was the head of the team, who gradually led the team to national fame. According to many then and current experts had a major impact on the success of the company led by František Čuba, who introduced work motivational factors (e.g. existential / fear / self-realization / joy at work). According to his words, Čuba had not had a vacation since 1963 and in the same year he announced a fight against alcohol among all cooperative members in Slušovice, which proved to be functional and effective. JZD AK Slušovice also withstood the devastating local summer flash flood in June 1987, which hit the buildings of AK Slušovice very hard. The sales of the cooperative in 1989, when it was at its peak, reached 7 billion crowns, and the profit was almost 830 million. It expanded to the USSR, Vietnam and Egypt and also cooperated with companies in Italy and West Germany.\nSlušovice vegetables grown in the Wallachian foothills in greenhouses and hydroponics were famous, corn was grown on a large scale and cattle were raised. Modern agricultural practices and computer technology were introduced. The cooperative had a wide associated production program from biochemistry (preparations for combating insects, which were exported to, for example, Asia, and others), through yogurts, tires and computers, to cows. The cooperative also imported Tuzex-type foreign goods, which it sold in its own Kvatro stores. In the 1980s, neighboring JZDs were incorporated under the JZD AK Slušovice and the same agrarian technologies were applied, especially new crops and chemistry to achieve yields that greatly exceeded the standards of the time. The village of Slušovice itself grew significantly and became rich during the given period. Nationally popular horse races were held here, and the local football team fought its way from the district championship to II. leagues.\nIn the years 1986–87, a four-lane road connection to the I/49 road was built, which diverted traffic away from the old buildings and the area of the racetrack within Slušovice. JZD Slušovice gradually expanded its activities to many areas, for example its own airline Air Moravia or the construction of test tracks for the West German car manufacturer Audi in Czechoslovakia. He also became famous for an effective care system called the Pensioners' Club, which guaranteed care to everyone who had worked at the company for at least 10 years.\n\n\n=== The Fall and the Velvet Revolution ===\nČuba describes the period after 1990 as the alleged deliberate liquidation of Slušovice by the new state power, when the result was distrust of customers, reluctance of banks to lend money, etc. He also described this period in an interview for the Slovak magazine Farmář or in February 2010 for the magazine Ekonom.\nSince the beginning of 1990, the Civic Forum (OF) JZD DAK Slušovice dealt with complaints about the alleged criminal activity of the management of the cooperative, which, however, was never proven. Allegedly, it was about possible machinations after November 17, 1989 (tunneling through newly established joint-stock companies, masking tax and other frauds, etc.). František Čuba considered these claims to be nonsensical and arose, among other things, from a misunderstanding of the internal functioning of the cooperative, just as he explained the creation of new joint-stock companies as legal on the basis of the then regulations on the transformation of cooperatives. On February 18, 1990, the local OF turned to the chairwoman of the People's Control Committee of the Czech Republic (VLK). The data from the complaints was not enough to start a criminal prosecution, but the VB investigation administration proposed to carry out a review investigation from the level of the VLK and the ministries of agriculture and finance. Subsequently, at the end of June 1990, according to indirect evidence, some documents on JZD's management should have been liquidated, and at the same time, the safe of the joint-stock company MORAGRO was robbed, from which, in addition to money, documents on the establishment and management of this company were stolen. This liquidation and theft was never clarified, during the investigation only the whistleblowers were invited for interviews, not the suspects.\nIn the period from the autumn of 1989 to the summer of 1991, 101 joint-stock companies were founded, into which the assets of the former cooperative were transferred. Čuba himself allowed the creation of 42 companies. The first as, Ekotrans Moravia, was against the will of the communist regime founded on the basis of the Austro-Hungarian Law on Joint Stock Companies already on June 29, 1989 (entered in the company register on August 2). In addition to Slušovice, its shareholders were 64 other state-owned enterprises, including the Třinec and Vítkovice ironworks and the shoemaker Svit. The company's goal was to build the Danube-Odra-Labe water corridor . Among the largest and most problematic joint stock companies was Moragro, founded on December 17, 1989 (incorporated on January 8, 1990).\nIn 1990, the cooperative was renamed to Družstevní agrokombinát Slušovice, and in 1993 to Zemědělské obchodní družstvo FORUM. In 1997 the cooperative went into liquidation, in 1999 the cooperative's assets were declared bankrupt. Creditors reported claims in the amount of CZK 5.768 billion, while the largest creditor was the Zlín financial office with CZK 5.6 billion. The bankruptcy was lifted in 2011 after meeting the schedule resolution, when creditors were satisfied at 0.018%.\n\n\n== TNS Computer Manufacturing ==\nComputers of the TNS series ( abbreviation for \"Our System\")  were produced by JZD Slušovice between 1982 and 1989. TNS computers had their origin in the form of an improved design of the ZVT SPU-800 microcomputer created in Transport Construction Olomouc, which replaced the original TP8 processor by a Zilog Z80 compatible processor. The ZVT SPU-800 peripheral cards could also be used in 8-bit TNS systems after minor modifications. Originally, the TNS computer was intended for agrarian fields, where there was no similar Czechoslovak alternative. It was later planned to be used to teach programming in schools, where the Tesla company's Ondra School and Home Computer was to be used . Several school programming classrooms were equipped with TNS computers, for example at the Nicolaus Copernicus Mathematical Gymnasium, but no more massive deployments took place. The Ondra computer was used by several Homes of Pioneers and Youth within their computer technology circles.\nComputer models of two series were produced – 8-bit computers of the TNS/Agrosystem series and 16-bit computers of the TNS HC-16/XT/AT series. The \"real\" Slušovice computers are 8-bit (with a U880D processor, a Zilog Z80 clone ), and only the HC-16 model was 16-bit.\n\n\n=== TNS series computers ===\nTNS ST (c. 1982) - It contained two diskette drives and a keyboard in a wider black case, built into a table from Zbrojovka Brno (tables for Consul 2713). It housed an alphanumeric terminal with a mosaic printer . The ST model used a module to connect 1 to 2 eight-inch single-sided drives with a single recording density.\nTNS SC (c. 1985) - The first model to be housed in the TNS SL-64 cartridge. It had an integrated power supply, an expansion bus to which functional cards were connected. The memory of this computer was 64 KB of RAM . It consisted of two large white metal boxes. One of them was larger and contained two 8″ diskette drives, the other narrower box contained cards. Furthermore, the model included a monitor (a modified Tesla Merkur) and a keyboard.\nTNS GC and TNS GC/W (1987) - This was an improved model of the SC version that was put into the TNS SL-256 cartridge. Compared to the SC model, it allowed color output to the monitor and had a larger memory of 256 KB RAM. In addition, the GC/W model included a Winchester ( HDD ) in a floppy disk cartridge .\nTNS TC (c. 1988), also \"Technology Computer\". Served as a control element in various environments to manage technological procedures and processes. It contained 64 kB of operational RAM and programmed fixed memory of the EPROM type in the range from 1 to 32 kB and an integrated BASIC interpreter. In appearance, it is based on the Agrosystem series.\nTNS MC and TNS MC/W (1989) - This was the last type of 8-bit computer in the TNS series. The RAM memory was up to 960 KB and the hard SCSI disk controller, built on MH3212 circuits. It allowed to connect up to 12 expansion modules. Two 5.25″ diskette drives and a Winchester with a capacity of 20 or 40 MB were integrated in the additional cabinet. The source used was of Polish production.\n\n\n=== HC series computers ===\nTNS HC (1988) - HC (Home Computer) computers generally fell into the professional use category and were designed as part of a budget computer system. It was a compact computer intended for schools. It included an integrated high-quality membrane keyboard with an honored keyboard (the command \"enter\" read \"take\"). The HC series was a single-board microcomputer based on the Zilog Z80A processor, operating at 3 MHz with 320 KB of RAM, of which 32 KB was occupied by video RAM . It also functioned as a terminal to SMEP or JSEP computers . The computer was running the TNS-DOS or CP/M operating system . An external source EA1605 was used as power supply, which was connected to the computer with a multi-core shielded cable, terminated with a nine-pin CANON connector.\nTNS HC-16 (1989) – It was designed mainly for use in school and business environments. It was based on the TNS HC computer concept in appearance, but was a single-board variant of the IBM-PC XT compatible computer. The main difference was in the processor used. Instead of the 8-bit Z80, a 16-bit Intel 8088 processor was used here . The computer was also equipped with 1 MB of RAM and was supplied with a CGA graphics card (16 colors) located in one of the two ISA bus slots, but these ISA slots did not have a standard back plate (bracket). The keyboard was the same as the previous model, but it was no longer honored. A parallel port, a serial port, a LAN connector, a parallel mouse (TESLA 3WN 166 07) and a 34-pin FDD were brought out in the back . An external EA1605 HC power supply was used as a power supply, which was based on the original EA1605 power supply, but was located in a different case and had a different output connector. The HC-16 computer board was designed to expand the RAM by an additional 256 KB (from Intel P21256 circuits), which could only be used with a special driver. Also, the MM58167 real-time ( RTC ) circuit was not installed on the board, although the I/O address decoders for this circuit were installed. However, it is not known if the RTC supported the installed BIOS .\n\n\n=== IBM-PC compatible computers ===\nThey are no longer \"real\" good computers, like the ones described above. The cooperative imported embargoed components for sixteen-bit computers from abroad, assembled them here, affixed the TNS brand to the box, and then sold them domestically at a high price. For IBM XT/AT computers, the cooperative produced its own cards, e.g. an expansion card for connecting a printer via a parallel port.\nTNS XT (circa 1988) - The heart was an Intel 8088 processor with 540 KB of RAM. The graphics card was CGA. The computer case housed the power supply, a 20MB hard drive, and a 5¼\" floppy drive for 360KB floppy disks. The computer was running MS-DOS 3.0. In 1990, the computer was sold for 98,000 CZK . A substantial part of the price was the supplied software .\nTNS-PC AT 286-12MHz (about 1988) - This was a computer whose heart was an Intel 80286 processor with a frequency of 12 MHz. The computer was equipped with 4x 256 KB RAM memory modules and an EGA graphics card . The hard disk was 40 MB in size. The floppy drive was still 5¼\" and could read 360KB floppy disks. It came with a 14″ monitor and MS-DOS 3.0 operating system. The price of this computer was between 200,000 and 300,000 CZK.\nTNS-PC AT 386-16 MHz (around the end of 1989) - it was a computer with an Intel 80386 processor with a frequency of 16 MHz with 4x 1 MB RAM modules. It came with a 14″ EGA/ VGA monitor and MS-DOS 4.1 operating system, Norton Commander 4.0 disk manager and T602 text editor . The price of this computer was around 60,000 CZK in 1989, and in 1992 it was allegedly sold for 35,000 CZK .\n\n\n== In culture ==\nSlušovice was inspired by the film Hauři released in cinemas in 1987 (directed by Július Matula, literary work by Stanislav Vácha, later published as a novel Hauři ). Similar to the political scene of the time, the film was ambiguous, admiring the new methods of the fictional modern cooperative, but at the same time criticizing them as an abandonment of tradition and dehumanized technocratism.\nIn 1988, the journalist Stanislav Vácha published the popular science publication How Slušovice Runs (168 pages). Based on his internships at JZD Slušovice, the author analyzes the organization and internal structure of this company and the mechanism of its activity.\nIn 1999, director Robert Sedláček filmed the documentary František Čuba: The Slušovick miracle,  which retrospectively describes and explains the main factors of the Slušovice company and its post-revolutionary forced disintegration.\nThe success of Slušovice also left its mark on Czech popular culture, the singer-songwriter duo Miroslav Paleček and Michael Janík wrote a song about Slušovice called Slušovice (it was released on their CD Kukátko and something else ). The song was also heard in the big revue program of Czechoslovak Television from 1988, which was called Jedeme dál ze Slušovice and was filmed at the Parkhotel in Slušovice.  Slušovice is also mentioned in the 1989 film Zdeňka A Bit of Sun, Hay and a Few Faces and in the 1986 film \"Velká filmová lupež\".\nFrom 1979 to 1990, the magazine Naše cesta: zpravodaj JZD Slušovice  was published .\n\n\n== References ==",

Due to frequent snow whirlwinds in winter, indicator poles had been installed along the road.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Col de la Fageole is situated in the municipality of Coren, at an altitude of 1,114 meters. It is accessible from the A75 motorway.\nA wind farm is located nearby.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis pass is feared in winter as the ascent can become difficult due to frequent snowfalls from late autumn until May. Snowdrift barriers have been installed there.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Col de la Fageole at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Testigo is a federal rock trio originally from Neuquén and Córdoba, Argentina. The band is composed of Pablo Montoya on guitar and vocals, Marcelo Matos on bass and backing vocals, and Ezequiel Galeassi on drums. Emerging from different musical groups, these three talented musicians came together to explore new sounds and create a unique musical proposition that fuses the energy of rock with elements of various influences.\n\n\n== History ==\nTestigo's musical journey began with the release of their debut album, No Me Importa, recorded at Estudios Maya in Córdoba under the direction of renowned producer Luis Primo, with Gabriel Cabrera in charge of mastering. This first work showed the band's tireless pursuit of their own authentic sound, accompanied by a series of live performances that allowed them to expand their fan base and establish themselves as a promising force in the local music scene.\nIn 2015, Testigo took a significant step forward by collaborating with renowned producer Edu Schmidt (former Árbol) on the production of their second album, Maquinal. Edited by Sony Music and distributed by Popart Discos, this work stood out for its powerful lyrics and catchy melodies, with hits like \"Pitufos\" and \"Recordando\" resonating throughout Argentina. The band embarked on an extensive national tour, performing in cities such as Villa Carlos Paz, Embalse, La Falda, La Rioja, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Paraná, La Plata, and more, participating in renowned festivals like Córdoba Rockea and the Fiesta de la Primavera, Cosquín Rock.\nIn 2018, Testigo released their third album, Arden Flores, under the production of Mariano Martínez from Attaque 77, recorded at Estudio del Abasto Monsterland by Álvaro Villagra, a Grammy winner for his work with Santana. The first single, \"Nunca Entenderás\", featured the collaboration of Mariano Martínez, contributing his unmistakable guitar and vocal sound. This album marked a turning point in the band's career, consolidating their distinctive sound and presence in the Argentine rock scene.\nIn addition to their musical work, Testigo has placed a strong emphasis on creating audiovisual content, with over 15 videos including music videos and live performances available on their YouTube channel. The band has participated in major events, including the celebration of Attaque 77's 30th anniversary and a national tour covering new provinces such as Neuquén and Río Negro.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDesenchufado (2014)\nNo Me Importa (2015)\nMaquinal (2016)\nArden Flores (2022)\n\n\n=== Select singles ===\n\"Todo Mal\"\n\"Nunca Entenderás\" (feat.

The Kebaran mortars that have been found are sculpted, slightly conical bowls of porous stone.\nIn the 3rd millennium BCE, chlorite stone artifacts were very popular, and traded widely. These carved dark stone vessels have been found everywhere in ancient Mesopotamia. They rarely exceed 25 cm in height, and may have been filled with precious oils. They often carry human and animal motifs inlaid with semi-precious stones.\n\n\"Elaborate stone vessels carved with repeating designs, both geometric and naturalistic, in an easily recognizable “intercultural style”, were made primarily of chlorite; a number were produced at the important site of Tepe Yahya southeast of Kerman (Iran) in the middle and late 3rd millennium b.c.e. Some of these vessels were painted natural color (dark green) and inlaid with pastes and shell, and some have even been found with cuneiform inscriptions referring to rulers and known Sumerian deities. More than 500 vessels and vessel fragments carved in this style have been recovered from sites ranging from Uzbekistan and the Indus Valley (e.g., Mohenjo-daro) in the east to Susa and all the major Sumerian sites in Mesopotamia, including Mari, in the west and to the Persian Gulf, particularly Tarut and the Failaka Islands, in the south.\"\n\nStone vessels are among the commonest finds in the elite tombs of Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt.\nThe Plain of Jars is a megalithic archaeological landscape in Laos. It consists of thousands of stone jars scattered around the upland valleys and the lower foothills of the central plain of the Xiangkhoang Plateau. The jars are arranged in clusters ranging in number from one to several hundred.\nGiant jars of Assam - giant mysterious jars have been unearthed across four sites in Assam, India.\nHundreds of  them are  spread across a 300 square kilometer swath of Assam.\nThe jars may have been used for ancient human burial practices.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPottery\nStone carving\nDolsot\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nStone Vessels in the Near East during the Iron Age and the Persian Period, (c. 1200-330 BCE), Andrea Squitieri, 2017\nStone Vessels and Values in the Bronze Age Mediterranean, Andrew Bevan, 2007\nStone Vessels of the Cyclades in the Early Bronze Age, Pat Getz-Gentle, 1996, Penn State University Press",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2011-03-03 15:47:53",
        "content": "Ascaro (\"Askari\") was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\"). Commissioned in 1913, she served during World War I. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921, she was stricken in 1930.\n\n\n== Design, construction, and commissioning ==\nAscaro originated as Tsing Po (or Ching Po), a destroyer based on the Italian Soldato class that the Chinese Empire ordered in 1910 for the Imperial Chinese Navy. Tsing Po differed from the other destroyers of her class in having a unique mixed-fuel propulsion system, with one coal-fired boiler and two oil-fired ones. Her armament also differed: While the other Soldato-class ships had four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns, Tsing Po was to have a mixed armament of two 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre and four 47 mm (1.9) guns in addition to three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\nThe eleventh and last Soldato-class ship to be constructed, Tsing Po was laid down in 1911 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy, a year after the completion of all the other units of the class. While she was on the building ways, the Kingdom of Italy purchased her in 1912 for service in the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") Renamed Ascaro, she was launched on 6 December 1912 and completed on 21 July 1913. She was commissioned in July 1913.\nAs completed, Ascaro was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. She could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). Uniquely among the Soldato-class ships, she retained her mixed-fuel propulsion system, which gave her a range comparable to that of the other ships of her class, 1,500 nautical miles (2,800 km; 1,700 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). The Italians abandoned the gun armament the Chinese envisoned for her, and instead fitted her with the same armament as the rest of the Soldato class, i.e., four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Service history ==\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Ascaro, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain)  Baistrocchi, was part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included her sister ships Alpino, Carabiniere, Fuciliere, and Pontiere and the destroyer Zeffiro.\nIn October 1916 Ascaro, the destroyers Borea, Garibaldino, and Nembo and four torpedo boats provided protection and support to a landing force consisting of the armored cruiser Francesco Ferruccio and the steamers Ausonia, Bulgaria, Choising, and Polcevera sent to occupy Sarandë (known to the Italians as Santi Quaranta), in the Principality of Albania. At 05:15 on 2 October 1916, four platoons of sailors, a unit of miners, and a unit of personnel from Francesco Ferruccio landed on the beach and quickly occupied the area, the 32 members of the Greek garrison at Sarandë having no option other than to retreat after protesting the Italian operation. After disembarking an infantry battalion and a cavalry squadron, the steamers departed at 16:00 on 2 October for Vlorë, where they embarked more troops. On 3 October, Ausonia and Polcevera landed a pack artillery battery and a second cavalry squadron, and on 4 October the operation was completed when Bulgaria and Choising put another infantry battalion and a third cavalry squadron ashore.\nAscaro continued her war service but did not participate in any other significant operations during the war. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAscaro was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. She was stricken from the naval register on 31 May 1930. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

        "content": "In the early hours of 26 April 2024, a fire occurred at a guesthouse in Porto Alegre. The fire resulted in the deaths of ten people.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe guesthouse was located in a three-story building on Avenida Farrapos. According to residents, the inn was from the Garoa chain. The flames started around 2am, and firefighters were called around 2:20am. The fire occurred near a gas station. The commander of the 1st Battalion of the Fire Department, Lúcio Junes da Silva, said that the rooms in the guesthouse were very close together, causing the fire to spread quickly and preventing many people from leaving. At around 3am, five Fire Department trucks helped put out the fire. The Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu), the Military Brigade and the Public Transport and Circulation Company (EPTC) were also present, and traffic was completely blocked. By 4am, the fire was under control, according to the Fire Department, which was now working in the aftermath (fighting small outbreaks). Approximately an hour later, however, more intense flames appeared again and the building was completely destroyed.\nAccording to RecordTV, two people died from smoke inhalation, while eight were burned to death. Two victims were on the first floor, five on the second and three on the third. Eleven people were rescued; eight were sent to hospitals by firefighters and EMS. Others received care at Hospital Cristo Redentor. Six injured people were taken to the Porto Alegre Emergency Hospital. The Municipal Health Department (SMS) reported that two people were intubated and in serious health. Another, also serious, had 20% of her body burned, and another had a fractured leg. The Fire Department reported that there were no missing people.\nCaptain Barbara Oliveira said that some people jumped from the balcony to escape the flames; in an interview, a witness said that a resident jumped from the third floor.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe site did not have a permit or a Fire Prevention and Protection Plan (PPCI) and, therefore, operated irregularly. The cause of the fire is unknown, and will be investigated by the firefighters and the Civil Police. Colonel Evaldo de Oliveira Junior, who is the municipal coordinator of Civil Protection and Defense of Porto Alegre, said that the hypothesis of an arson was being preliminarily worked on, and that the criminal would have entered the place during the early hours of the morning. According to Metrópoles, \"Those who participated in fighting the flames believe that a lighter or a match may have started the fire.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe mayor of Porto Alegre, Sebastião Melo, lamented what happened on social media, saying that he was investigating the causes \"with deep sadness\". Eduardo Leite, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, said the fire \"profoundly dismays us\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tel Masos (Tel Mashush, Arabic: Khirbat al-Mashush, Khirbat el Mashash) is an archaeological site in Israel, in northern Negev, about 15 kilometres southeast of Beer-Sheva, along the Beer-Sheva River. It is actually a cluster of different sites scattered around the wells in the area.\n\n\n== Excavations ==\nThere were three archaeological excavation seasons at the site; the first was in 1972, and then in 1974–1975. The excavations were conducted by an Israeli-German team led by Yohanan Aharoni, Aharon Kempinski from Tel Aviv University and Prof. Fritz from the University of Mainz in Germany.\nAbout 10 four-room houses were found, arranged contiguously so as to form an enclosure or an enclosure. Masos\n\n\n== Chalcolithic period ==\nThe settlement first arose around 3200 BC at the end of the Chalcolithic period. At that time, the settle­ment was about 15 acres in size. The same type of a settle­ment is also found in Tel Malhata; these two formed part of a chain of settlements that existed along the Beer Sheva Valley. Activity continued here until about 1600 BC, which was in the Late Bronze Age, after which the settlement resumed again in 1200 BC.\nRemains of residential caves were found at the site, identical in shape to those discovered at other sites of the Beersheba culture.\nPublic buildings were found on the site, which were built at the beginning of the twelfth century BC and in which an Egyptian - Canaanite influence is evident.\n\n\n== In the Bible ==\nBased on biblical references, Yohanan Aharoni identified Tel Masos with the biblical town of Horma. However, not all researchers agree with this identification.\nOther researchers such as Israel Finkelstein see Tel Masos as an Amalekite settlement, or perhaps as associated with the coastal settlements during the Philistine period; thus they reject the identification of the site as an Israeli city.\nNadav Na’aman (2021) sees Tel Masos as playing a big role in Faynan copper economy, but he identifies this town with early Edom.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTel Masos is believed to have played a big role in the mining and smelting activities associated with copper extraction in Timna valley. It was a prosperous settlement at that time, being seen an important trading hub controlling copper production in the Arabah. It also played a big role as a centre of incense trade at the northern extremity of the Arabian incense trading route.\nAccording to Na'aman, the Edomites constructed a centre at Khirbet en-Nahas where the metallurgical production was concentrated, while Tel Masos coordinated the transportation and the territorial administration.\n\n\n== Egyptian influence ==\nThe Pharaoh Shoshenq’s campaign to south Canaan may have played a big role in the history of this area, and it occasioned many academic debates. Scholars agree that the main objects of his campaign was to get access to copper resources. Also, there apparently was a change in the production technique of copper at that time (late 10th-9th centuries). A scarab with Shoshenq’s name was found in the area at Khirbet Hamra Ifdan.\nYet the timing and the extent of Shoshenq’s conquests remain controversial, with different scholars giving different interpretations. Debates continue about Shoshenq’s topographical inscriptions of different sites he conquered, and whether or not they are accurate. Also how long the Egyptian control continued after him remains unclear.\n\n\n== Later period ==\nThe last settlement established at Tel Masos was a Syriac-Nestorian monastery where inscriptions were found in Syriac from the end of the seventh century or the beginning of the eighth century CE. These inscriptions were written by the monks of the Nestorian order. A church was found in the monastery and sarcophagi containing the skeletons of monks were discovered.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKhirbat Faynan\nWadi Feynan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEdelman, Diane. “Tel Masos, Geshur, and David.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 47, no. 4 (1988): pp. 253–258.\nTebes, Juan M. “A New Analysis of the Iron Age I ‘Chiefdom’ of Tel Masos (Beersheba Valley).” Aula Orientalis 21 (2003): pp. 63–78.\nFINKELSTEIN, I. 2020. “The Arabah Copper Polity and the Iron Age Edom: A Bias in Biblical Archaeology?” In: Antiguo Oriente 18, 11–32.\nFRITZ, V. and KEMPINSKI, A. 1983.

On 13 March 2024, Farkas has been replaced due to 19 points and thirteenth place as head coach by Zsolt Kollár, who previously worked as a player from 2012 to 2017 and then as a youth coach at the club. He has also failed to deliver victories for the club fleeing relegation, scoring just 1 point in 5 rounds. In his place, Flórián Urbán, who really started his coaching career at REAC and brought the team to the NB I in 2005, was appointed on 17 April 2024 to lead the team to the last rounds of the league.\n\n\n== Kits ==\n\n\n== First team squad ==\nThe players listed had league appearances and stayed until the end of the season.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "content": "Aydon \"Fuzzy\" Benas (born September 25, 2002) is an American artistic gymnast. He is a member of the USA national team and is currently competing for the Oklahoma Sooners in NCAA gymnastics.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBenas was born in 2002 to Shannon and Adam Benas.  His parents gave him the nickname Fuzzy when they were getting a sonogram and wanted to know the gender – the nurse said the picture was \"too fuzzy\" to tell, so they started calling him that before he was even born.\n\n\n== Junior gymnastics career ==\nBenas was the 2018 co-national champion in the 15-16 age division alongside Isaiah Drake and Justin Ah Chow.  At the 2019 Winter Cup Benas won gold on rings and placed fourth in the all-around.\nIn early 2020 Benas competed at the 2020 Winter Cup where he placed first in the all-around and on rings.  The remainder of competitions in 2020 were either canceled or postponed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.  In November of that year Benas signed his National Letter of Intent with the Oklahoma Sooners.\n\n\n== Senior gymnastics career ==\n\n\n=== 2022–23 ===\nBenas became age-eligible for senior level competition in 2022.  He competed at the 2022 Winter Cup where he placed eleventh in the all-around.  He competed at the NCAA Championships where he helped Oklahoma finish second as a team.  He was named College Gymnastics Association's Rookie of the Year.\nAfter the end of the college season, Benas underwent shoulder surgery and spent the next few months recovering.  In October he severed a nerve in his hand during a pumpkin carving accident.  Right after Benas was medically clear to restart training, he tore his ACL.  As a result, Benas did not compete during the 2023 NCAA season.\nBenas returned to competition in August to compete at the 2023 U.S. Classic and the 2023 U.S. National Championships, although he did not compete on all six apparatuses.\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\nBenas made his elite all-around return at the 2024 Winter Cup where he placed sixth.  As a result, he was added to senior national team for the first time.  Additionally Benas was selected to compete at the DTB Pokal Mixed Cup in Stuttgart alongside Riley Loos, Kai Uemura, Addison Fatta, Dulcy Caylor, and Nola Matthews.  While there he helped the USA finish first as a team.\nAt the 2024 NCAA Men's Gymnastics Championship, Benas helped Oklahoma finish third as a team.  Individually he placed third in the all-around behind Khoi Young and Fred Richard.  He was named CGA's Gymnast of the Year.\n\n\n== Competitive history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

His childhood name was Yunosuke. Due to the premature deaths of his four older brothers and Yorimasa's adopted son Yorinaga, he became the heir apparent.\nOn November 21, 1862, he succeeded to the family headship due to his father's retirement. During the Boshin War in 1868, he sided with the imperial forces despite being from a loyal domain. In June 1869, he became the governor of the domain through the abolition of the feudal system, and after the abolition of domains in 1871, he was dismissed from his position and moved to Tokyo. In 1884, he was granted the title of viscount.\nHe died on December 3, 1905, at the age of 63 (62 by Western reckoning).\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRank of Shoshi - December 26, 1887\n\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nSaijō Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tatler XFEST Hong Kong, Hong Kong Team vs Inter Miami CF is a friendly football match between Hong Kong League XI and Inter Miami CF held in Hong Kong Stadium on 4 February 2024, during the American team's visit.\nInter Miami won the match by 4–1, but the no-show of Lionel Messi (Yue Chinese: 美斯缺陣), football star of the visiting team, has enraged Hong Kong and Chinese fans and the Hong Kong government, most of which were gripped by Messi fever. With the Messi Mess or Messi's Mess (Yue Chinese: 美斯之亂) evolving into a diplomatic and political controversy, organiser Tatler Asia, which heavily publicised the visit of Messi, eventually agreed to a half refund. Messi was also accused of anti-China and is placed at the centre of cultural and geopolitical tensions across China, the United States, Argentina, Japan and Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the Hong Kong government having revoked all pandemic restrictions in early 2023, few renowned celebrities have visited since. The imposition of national security law in 2020, the slowing growth of Chinese economy, and the slump of Hong Kong stock market which gave rise to the claims of \"relic of global financial hub\", are said to have diminished the attractiveness of Hong Kong. The government therefore decided to boost the economy through mega events, in order to promote Hong Kong and stimulate spending of the public.\n\n\n=== Announcement ===\nPui Kwan-kay, President of Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), revealed in an interview on 9 February 2024 that Inter Miami had arranged to play a friendly match in Shanghai back in last November, but was unable to proceed due to the delay in obtaining permits. Since the organising Shanghai sports corporation had paid the deposit and the team had travel plans, intermediaries approached Pui expressing their desire for Hong Kong to take over the match. The rumoured appearance fee was US$10 million, and Shanghai had paid US$3 million. However, Pui said he unequivocally rejected the offer for the \"astronomical\" and \"unrealistic\" price. According to Pui, the match was later made possible by the Hong Kong Government, and was scheduled in 2024.\nSeen as one of the first mega events, Inter Miami CF announced in December 2023 that it will travel to Asia in the upcoming February for the club's first-ever international tour, and the team will play a match in Hong Kong on 4 February, taking on the Hong Kong Team, as part of the tour. The tour would be organised by Tatler Asia, Asian edition of the British fashion magazine which had no prior experience in hosting sports events. Both Argentine superstar Lionel Messi, who previously visited Hong Kong in 2014 and won the World Cup in 2022, and Uruguay footballer Luis Suárez are going to join the tour.\nTatler Asia and Hong Kong officials promoted the event as the \"world's top-level football match\" and the most attractive sports event of the year in Hong Kong. Chinese and southeast Asian tourists are expected to travel to Hong Kong for the friendly match, which would demonstrate the city's capability as \"Events Capital of Asia\". Hong Kong culture minister Kevin Yeung said the government has provided a matching grant of $16 million through the M Mark event subsidy scheme and approved a range of support measures for Tatler Asia, including a venue hiring grant.\n\n\n=== Ticket sales began ===\nTickets of the match were open for sale in January 2024, with lowest cost at $800 and highest at $4,800, breaking the city's record as the most expensive football tickets. Nonetheless, with the reputation of Messi, whom Tatler Asia heavily advertised on, more than 2 million fans tried to buy the tickets online, and all tickets were sold out within an hour. However, Tatler Asia were coy as to whether Messi will play in the exhibition match, claiming there is no deal in place and that \"at the end of the day, it’s going to be the decision of the coach to decide who is going to play and for how long\", which was disputed by a senior government source that there are \"contract terms specifying that Messi would play in the match, save for illness or injury\".\nInter Miami took on Saudi Al Hilal SFC on 29 January and Al Nassr FC on 1 February. Messi was substituted at 87th minute while playing against Al Hilal, and reportedly felt unwell afterwards and continued into the training on 31 January. He eventually played for 7 minutes as substitution at the match against Al Nassar because of requests under contract terms in spite of club's advice to rest for a few days. This has raised concern of his possible injuries in Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Arrival and training ==\n\n\n=== Arrival ===\n\nAfter finishing the match in Saudi Arabia, Inter Miami's delayed flight touched down at Hong Kong International Airport at half past two in the afternoon local time on 2 February, pushing the welcome ceremony back an hour. Apparently exhausted and under hot temperature, the squad, led by manager Gerardo Martino and joined by 23 footballers including Messi and Suárez, hopped on a bus after a photo session at the apron without answering reporters' questions, despite the master of ceremonies asking them to stay for further formalities. The group of children hoping to get the pictures with the football stars were left disappointed. Around ten minutes later, Hong Kong officials including sports commissioner Sam Wong arrived and took pictures with the waiting kids, Jorge Mas, owner of Inter Miami, and Michel Lamunière, CEO of Tatler Asia. The team meanwhile stayed on the bus, and left the airport a few minutes later.\nIn the press conference later that afternoon, Martino said Messi felt a twinge in his hamstring and underwent an MRI earlier this week to assess the problem, and would wait until Saturday, the playing day, to decided if Messi could start the match and how much game time he would play, depending on his condition. Martino asserted that the aspiration is that Messi can play as many minutes as possible, but he will most certainly be on the pitch.\n\n\n=== Open training ===\n\nMessi and his Inter Miami teammates took part in an open training session later that day, joined by a record of 39,916 spectators, with ticket price between HK$580 to HK$780. Around 15,000 free tickets were distributed by the government, Laureus Sport for Good, and HKFA to grassroot community, students, youth and para athletes. Greeted by the large crowd, Messi emerged 15 minutes after his teammates and waved at the fans. However, Messi and Suárez did not spent as much time on kicking a ball, as Messi did back stretching instead.\nDavid Beckham, the club's co-owner who arrived earlier than the team, also appeared and thanked those present for the \"special welcome\". He was stopped for a selfie by one of several pitch invaders, who brought the event to an early conclusion, with Miami players staying around for just 40 minutes rather than 90.\nThe US club also took part in a coaching clinic for 80 local children, where Messi and Beckham were seen playing with the kids.\n\n\n=== Private events ===\nTatler Asia arranged 30-minute meet-and-greet session and autograph session of Inter Miami players, with the price at HK$150k and HK$120k respectively. The Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel invited Messi, Jordi Alba, and Sergio Busquets from Inter Miami, paralympic medalist So Wa-wai, Special Olympics football player Lee Ho-yung, and disability activist Mok Kim-wing to meet up two severely-ill children from Make-A-Wish Hong Kong, and signed autographs for them.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\nIn the Inter Miami's social media post, Messi was not included on the line-ups, while Suárez was listed as a substitute. The HKFA's website and the team sheet signed by club staff and submitted to match officials, however, showed Messi listed on the team sheet as a substitute.\n\n\n=== Before match ===\n\nAt 12.30 p.m., three and a half hour before the scheduled start, the Hong Kong Stadium is open to spectators. The match attracted 38,417 attendances, while some media put the toll at 38,323.\nPlayers from both team entered the stadium at around 3 p.m. for warm-up, but Messi and Suárez were both missing. Government ministers, including Financial Secretary Paul Chan and Kelvin Yeung, along with tycoons and celebrities were amongst the spectators. Chief Executive John Lee was seen chatting with Beckham, and so were actor Tong Leung and his actress wife Carina Lau who took photos with the club's owner. Anson Lo and Keung To from local boy group MIRROR performed three songs as the match was about to start.\nThe line-up was announced at 3.55 p.m., whilst Messi and Suárez appeared and sat on substitutes benches.\n\n\n=== Match details ===\n\nThe match began at 4.07 p.m.. In the 40th minute Taylor feinted to his left from the corner of the box and fired a curling strike past the goalkeeper to open the scoring for Inter Miami. Just three minutes later Hong Kong equalized just before halftime with a goal by Anier. In the second half, Sunderland latched onto the square pass from the defender and reclaimed the lead in the 50th minute, followed by Campana receiving a pass in the box from Sunderland and scorings six minutes later. In the 62nd minute former Barcelona players Alba and Busquets joined the playing field. The final goal was scored in the 85th minute when Sailor flicked a header into the net, concluding the proceedings with a 1–4 result.\n\n\n=== Messi, Suárez benched ===\n\nAs many of the fans bought the ticket solely to see the superstar playing, chants of \"Messi\" could be heard throughout the match. But as it became clear that Messi would not make even the appearance, the boos and chants of \"refund\" (Yue Chinese: 回水) in Cantonese became louder during the last 10 minutes while some left early. The jeers rose to a crescendo at the final whistle after Suarez also failed to take to the pitch because of a knee injury. Eventually Messi and Suárez both sit out the friendly match, while Messi, wearing trousers only, was reported to have entered the dressing room during the halftime.\n\nTrophy was later presented to the visiting team, whilst boos and jeers continued to greet the players. Messi was standing at the back during photo taking, and went straight to the dressing room afterwards. Beckham thanked Hongkongers for their \"incredible welcome\", and \"look forward to coming back one day to entertain you even more\". His speech was drowned by boos despite the announcer's urge for respect. When he toured around to thank the fans, he signed an autograph for a fan that invaded the pitch and took a selfie. The match was brought to a close by local pop star G.E.M. with hymn Amazing Grace and a Spanish version of her song Gloria, but that did not calm the frustration. Fans took their anger out on some of the advertising around the stadium, with Messi's head torn off one display.\n\nMartino attended the press conference after the match and was apologetic. He thanked Hongkongers for their openness and that the team has been treated very well. But the coach defended the decision of not sending Messi and Suárez as there was no chance they could play. \"We understand fans are very disappointed and we ask for their forgiveness. We wish we could have sent them on the pitch for a while to play, but the risk was too big.\" He added Messi has muscle inflammation, and Suárez was not in condition due to swollen knee after the previous match in Saudi Arabia. Martino stressed it is the decision of the medical team made in the morning after checking their physical situation, and they also had to consider the obligations with the upcoming Major League Soccer.\n\n\n=== Reaction ===\nThe Hong Kong Government issued the first statement at 7.32 p.m., about an hour after the match ended.Regarding Messi not playing the match today, the Government, as well as all football fans, are extremely disappointed about the organiser's arrangement. The organiser owes all football fans an explanation.It also said the match was awarded \"M\" Mark status, a matching grant of HK$15 million, and a grant for venue of HK$1 million by the Major Sports Events Committee. The committee will take follow-up actions with the organiser, which includes \"reducing the amount of funding as a result of Messi not playing the match\". It was followed by another Government's statement a few hours later criticising the organiser of failing to provide a detailed explanation promptly, and Messi for not explaining his absence, and \"the way that the organiser and Inter Miami CF handled the situation could not meet the expectations of the fans who showed strong support to Messi, especially those visitors who came all the way here for the match.\"\nLater that day, Tatler Asia also expressed \"extreme disappointment\" over Messi's absence in a statement, but clarified that \"despite some news reports, Tatler did not have any information about the non-participation\". The hotel where Inter Miami stayed was cordoned off by the police to prevent storming by furious fans.\n\n\n== Departure and Japan trip ==\nSpeculations on whether the final overseas leg of the tour would continue grew after a scheduled fixture against Japanese side Vissel Kobe was removed from Apple TV's schedule. MLS later clarified that the removal was due to logistical difficulties. Inter Miami concluded the Hong Kong trip on 5 February, leaving Hong Kong in the afternoon after the planned visit of Kai Tak Sports Park was cancelled. The convoy touched down in Tokyo later that day. Messi was seen more amiable than in Hong Kong.\n\nMessi said in a press conference that \"muscle discomfort\" had made it difficult for him to play and he hoped to return to Hong Kong \"whenever he can\". He added he felt \"much better\" in Japan comparing to the past days.The truth is that it was bad luck that I couldn’t be present on the day of the match in Hong Kong. In the first game of the tour in Saudi Arabia I felt discomfort in my adductor and that’s why I left the match. In the second game I played the minutes I played to test myself, to see what sensations I had and how I felt because I had an MRI done and the results showed that I had swelling in the adductor, but there was no injury. That’s why I tried. Then we went to Hong Kong and we were in the open training and I was present because of the number of people there and because there was also a clinic with kids and I wanted to be present and participate. But the truth is that the discomfort was still there and it made it very difficult for me to play. Unfortunately, it is something that happens in football, in any game it can happen that we get injured. It happened to me and I couldn’t be in the game in Hong Kong and it's a shame because I always want to participate, I want to be there, and even more so when it comes to these types of games where we traveled so far and people were so excited to watch us play. I hope we can return and we can play another game in Hong Kong and I can be present as I do whenever I can, but the truth is that it is a shame that I was not able to participate.\n\nMessi eventually joined the open training on the next day. The fixture went on as planned at night on 7 February. Suárez was at the starting lineup. Messi came on in the 60th minute and played for over 30 minutes, with his every touch being loudly applauded during his half-hour of the game. Vissel Kobe won by 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out which Messi did not take part.\nMessi posted on Weibo later that night in Chinese and Spanish.\n\nHello to all my fans in mainland China and Hong Kong! As I said in the press conference, it was a real shame not to be able to play in Hong Kong the other day due to a groin injury that had swollen and I was in pain. Anyone who knows me knows that I always want to play, that's what I always want, to do my best in any game. And especially in these games when we travel so far and fans are excited to see us attend the game healthily. Hopefully we can come back and play a game in Hong Kong. And I also hope to return to China as soon as possible and greet you all.\n\n\n== Government's role ==\n\n\n=== Contract requirements ===\n\nConfirming earlier media sources, Kevin Yeung on 5 February said Tatler Asia's contract with the government required Messi to play for at least 45 minutes, unless he was ill or injured, and the organiser had told the government before the match that Messi would play in the second half of the game. Some sources added Messi was required to receive the trophy and speak to fans as captain. However, just 10 minutes before the game ended, Tatler Asia confirmed Messi would stay on the bench. Officials then immediately requested them to explore other remedies, such as Messi appearing on the field to interact with his fans and receiving the trophy. Yeung added that officials had not had direct contact with Inter Miami, and had no idea of the severity of Messi's injuries or about the decision to leave him on the bench.\nThe Government is said to have invited Messi to tour the Victoria Harbour and Kai Tak Sports Park for HK$1 million in order to promote Hong Kong, but was rejected by Inter Miami well before the friendly match.\nIn a six-minute press conference on 5 the same day, Chairman of Tatler Asia Michel Lamunière said the contract agreement signed by Tatler and Inter Miami includes clauses to require Messi and Suarez to play in the match unless they are injured, and both were included in the official team sheet signed by Gerardo Martino before the match and that \"showed Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez as substitutes and therefore fit to play\". He said the club informed Tatler at half-time that Messi would be unable to play due to an injury, and the company immediately informed the government and urged Inter Miami to \"instruct Messi to address the fans, to no avail\". While early speculation claims the contract only committed \"famous players\" without naming Messi or Suárez, Tatler Asia said \"Inter Miami had committed under contract that all of their marquee players – Messi, Alba, Busquets and Suárez – would be required to play for 45 minutes unless injured\".\nHKFA was later criticised as well after reports emerged the Association agreed to let Tatler Asia sign a \"non-compulsory\" contract that does not force Messi to play at a lower price, unlike the one signed with Vissel Kobe which was a mandatory requirement for Messi to appear.\n\nLamunière changed his narrative during an interview with The Athletic on 15 February. Contrary to the statement released a day after the match, he said \"he had only discovered Messi would not play 15 minutes before the start of the game\", and the rest of the first half \"was spent trying to find solutions for Messi to play, talking, and moving around the pitch.\" Under the contract, Busquets and Alba also had to play a minimum of 45 minutes unless injured, yet the latter two arrived on the hour mark during the second half. Lamunière did not directly respond if this constituted a breach of agreement. He later clarified that he heard \"a possible problem and that the [Inter Miami] medical staff were working on Messi in the hope he could still play\".\n\n\n=== \"M\" Mark funding ===\nLamunière also announced on 5 February the withdrawal of the application for government's funds, and expressed deep regret over the disappointment of the fans and the disappointing ending. In response, Yeung reasserted giving up government funding had not entirely resolved the matter, and \"the organiser should deal with consumers' demands\". He said the funds had not yet been given to Tatler Asia. However, he admitted the authorities did not scrutinize the contract between Inter Miami and Talter Asia as \"business secrets\" do not require government's attention.\nJohn Lee said that he has directed the ministry to seriously review the Messi row and the \"M\" mark application procedures, including official's role and responsibilities in promoting future mega events, such as to require organisers submitting contingency plans and communicating updates as soon as possible.\nUnder Major Sports Events Application Guidelines, vetting procedures for applications of new \"M\" Mark events will take 6 months to complete under normal circumstances. But Beckham has only sealed the deal to bring Inter Miami to Hong Kong in around early December, meaning the approval of government's funding only took one and a half month. Wilfred Ng, chairman of Major Sports Events Committee, confirmed \"there will be special arrangements for large-scale events\" as members had considered the player line-up and the potential boost to Hong Kong's economy and to sports development. Ng added the consideration was also based on the 45-minute playing requirement in the contract and had no knowledge over the communication between Tatler Asia and Inter Miami.\n\n\n== Refund ==\n\nTatler Asia's VIP bundles, priced at HK$150k, includes VIP ticket for the match and meet-and-great session, along with limited merchandise. In addition, various souvenir gifts such as scarfs and jackets were sold during the training and the match. The total income of Tatler Asia, covering sponsorships and ticket fees, is believed to surpass HK$132 million, including HK$11 million from the open training session. Under the contract, Tatler Asia had paid Inter Miami HK$50 million for their appearance.\nUnder pressure that the withdrawal of government funding is insufficient, Tatler Asia announced a 50% refund to fans who purchased tickets through \"official channels\" on 9 February, with details to be provided in March. It comes after a closed-door meeting between Tatler Asia and authorities, at which the latter suggested a half refund according to media sources. The organiser again apologised to the fans who were disappointed by the football match \"that we had hoped to be the pride of the city, and which we have worked very hard on for months, has become the source of great heartbreak\". The unaudited figures estimated the refund could cost them HK$56 million, resulting in a net loss of HK$43 million. The group said they invited the Consumer Council to participate in the talks, and will not escape the responsibilities.\nThe Consumer Council received at least 1,465 complaints, including 302 from tourists, and the average amount of money involved in each case is HK$6,900, with the most expensive one involving HK$92,000. The Customs received 360 complaints and had set up a team to assess the claims. It also said appropriate enforcement action will be taken if violation of Trade Descriptions Ordinance is discovered.\nDetails were announced by Tatler Asia on 18 March, with those who purchased the tickets through ticketing platform Klook will receive an email notification and will have to reply to the email to accept the terms and conditions of the refund. Refunds will be processed within 30 days from the 12 April deadline. In response, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it is \"a responsible move\" which shows the organizer's positive and committed attitude to resolve the matter. However, Tatler Asia earlier said people must agree to drop any further legal complaints or claims before collecting refund. Consumer Council replied that consumers need not to dropping the complaints to them for the refund, but reminded those who paid using electronic payment systems might need to drop any complaints filed with their banks, and anyone who bought tickets from a secondary source or a scalper might not qualify for a refund.\n\n\n== Political storm ==\nWith the government involved in the widespread publicity of the match and the support given to the organiser, and after the Messi Mess was widely reported by foreign media, Hong Kong's ability to stand as the \"Events Capital\" is under the spotlight. Pro-Beijing legislator Michael Tien said the chaos had damaged the city's reputation, and former Financial Secretary John Tsang also worried the political storm could unavoidably harm the reputation. The debacle continued to swell throughout the week, with anti-China allegations and conspiracy theories on the rise, such as accusing Tatler Asia of having knowledge over Messi's anticipated absence.\n\n\n=== Conspiracy theories ===\n\nIn 2017, Messi sent his signed photo to his follower Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize Chinese laureate, through Howard Lam, a Hong Kong Democratic Party member. His actions were considered to be a support to Liu after knowing he was jailed for subversion. As for this friendly match, Messi avoided shaking hands with Hong Kong officials. He did not follow the team and walked past John Lee, who was sanctioned by the United States for \"undermining Hong Kong's Autonomy\" during the prize presentation, and only stood at the corner while taking photos.\nFurthermore, the significant contrast between Messi's performance in Hong Kong and Japan, just three days after, sparked attention from Hong Kong media and officials. Despite of the two explanations, commentators were still unconvinced, slamming him as a \"two-faced person\", and \"get out of here”.\nCulture, Sports and Tourism Bureau urged Tatler Asia and Inter Miami to provide a reasonable explanation on why Messi was fit to play in Japan, which he was seen \"actively playing in Japan, engaging in intense physical activities on the field for a considerable amount of time\". The Bureau added Hongkongers have many questions regarding this situation. Tatler Asia said \"the fact that Messi and Suárez played in Japan on February 7th feels like another slap in the face\".\n\nAn editorial on Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times criticised Inter Miami's and Messi's explanation for remaining on the bench as \"not convincing\", and urged the team to come up with a \"reasonable explanation\". It also warned of possible \"political motives\" that is not possible to be entirely dismissed.There is a lot of speculation about the true underlying reasons. One theory suggests that there might be political motives behind their actions, as Hong Kong intends to develop its mega-event based economy, and external forces deliberately seek to embarrass Hong Kong.\n\nRegina Ip, Executive Council convenor, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) \"Hong Kong people hate Messi, Inter Miami, and the 'black hand' behind them, for the deliberate and calculated snub to Hong Kong\". Ip added Hong Kong should never allow Messi to visit again. She admitted of having no hard evidence over foreign interference in the Messi Mess, \"but Messi behaved as though he was under some political directive not to play, not to shake hands with Hong Kong’s CE, not to speak, or smile or wave to Hong Kong’s fans. He apologised in Tokyo. Why not in Hong Kong?\" Hu Xijin, former editor of Global Times, question Messi of not playing in Hong Kong or shaking hands with John Lee, \"and why did he smile, run freely and looked fit in Japan?\".\nInter Miami reiterated that it was sorry Messi did not play, but added that injuries were \"unfortunately a part of the beautiful game\", and it is no one's fault that players get injured in football.\nAnother conspiracy theory singled out Inter Miami's Cuban-American co-owner Jorge Mas, which was linked to hawkish former President Ronald Reagan. Some judged this relationship and concluded \"Messi’s behavior in Hong Kong is really not an individual act\" and US-related involvement cannot be ruled out. Some pro-Beijing mouthpieces including Ta Kung Pao implied a connection between the incident and the Central Intelligence Agency via Mas' late father, Jorge Mas Canosa, who in the 1960s was trained by the CIA for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.\nOnline Chinese nationalists, dubbed Little Pink, flocked to Messi's Instagram and Weibo account, Chinese social media, launching a barrage of hostility. One message read: \"China does not welcome dwarves like you and please tell your Argentina football fans that the Falkland Islands belongs to England.\" Similar comments were found as well in the Weibo account of Argentine Embassy.\n\nMessi posted a two-minute Spanish video on 19 February, telling fans that it was \"totally untrue\" that he sat out the match for political reasons, and reiterated that he had been suffering from inflamed leg muscles. He also sent \"good wishes to everyone in China who I've always had special affection for\". I've had a very close and special relationship with China. I've done lots of things in China: interviews, games and events. I've also been there and played many times for FC Barcelona and the [Argentinian] national team. \n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nArgentina were scheduled to play two friendly internationals in Match, against Nigeria in Hangzhou and Ivory Coast in Beijing. But on 9 February, Hangzhou sports authorities said the match is cancelled in view of the \"current well-known reasons\", and \"conditions to hold the friendly match are not mature\". Beijing followed on the next day, announcing that Beijing \"currently has no plans to host relevant competitions in which Messi will participate\".\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV Sports Channel replaced frames of Messi winning the World Cup in a television programme with Philipp Lahm's victory in 2014, but that was removed as well as Lahm had previously criticised China's and Qatar's human rights problems and urged athletes in democratic countries to reveal their political stance. A Messi commercial was taken off air, while others remained despite of pressure from Chinese social media users.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pedro Díaz Muñoz (born 18 June 1977) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a winger, and currently is a manager.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn in Talavera de la Reina, Castilla–La Mancha, Díaz was a youth graduate of Atlético Madrid, before making his senior debut with hometown side Talavera CF in 1996. After failing to make a breakthrough in the starting XI, he was loaned to Tercera División side AD Torpedo 66 in the 1999–2000 season.\nUpon returning, Díaz started to feature regularly with Talavera before leaving for fellow third division side Novelda CF in January 2003. He returned to Talavera in July, before signing for CD Linares of the same category in 2006.\nDíaz scored a career-best 15 goals overall in the 2006–07 season, as Linares missed out promotion in the play-offs. On 22 July 2009, he moved to AD Ceuta also in division three. He moved to CD Puertollano in the same category in the following year, before returning to his hometown on 20 July 2012, after signing for CF Talavera de la Reina.\nIn 2017, after another promotion with Talavera, Díaz retired at the age of 40.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nImmediately after retiring, Díaz became manager of the youth sides of his last club Talavera. On 6 June 2021, he was named manager of their B-team in the Primera Autonómica Preferente. \nOn 25 October 2022, after leading Talavera B to a first-ever promotion to Tercera Federación the previous campaign, Díaz was named in charge of the first team in Primera Federación, following the sacking of Rubén Gala. Despite suffering relegation, he renewed his contract in May 2023, but was dismissed on 8 April 2024.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 7 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPedro Díaz at BDFutbol\nPedro Díaz manager profile at BDFutbol",

        "content": "The First Balochistan Conflict was a rebellion instigated by Prince Agha Abdul Karim and  Prince Muhammad Rahim of Kalat in response to accession of Kalat and with the aim of establishing Kalat as an independent state from Pakistan. With the arrest of the princes and loss of a lot of manpower, the rebellion ultimately came to an end in 1950 with Pakistan recapturing all territories.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBalochistan contained a Chief Commissioner's province and four princely states under the British Raj. The province's Shahi Jirga and the non-official members of the Quetta Municipality opted for Pakistan unanimously on 29 June 1947. Three of the princely states, Makran, Las Bela and Kharan, acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after independence. But the ruler of the fourth princely state, the Khan of Kalat, Ahmad Yar Khan, who used to call Jinnah his 'father', declared Kalat's independence as this was one of the options given to all of the 535 princely states by British Prime Minister Clement Attlee.\n\n\n== Conflict ==\nKalat finally acceded to Pakistan on 27 March 1948 after the 'strange help' of All India Radio and a period of negotiations and bureaucratic tactics used by Pakistan. The signing of the Instrument of Accession by Ahmad Yar Khan, led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against his brother's decision in July 1948. Princes Agha Abdul Karim Baloch and Muhammad Rahim, refused to lay down arms and lead the Dosht-e Jhalawan (numbering around 1000 militants) in unconventional attacks on the army.\n\n\n== Battle of Jhalwan ==\nThe Baloch militants captured the area of Jhalawan and used it as a base to stage further operations against Pakistani armed forces, after an offensive Pakistani forces were able to recapture this area. The militants suffered heavy casualties and were demoralised which ultimately contributed to their surrender.\n\n\n== Foreign involvement ==\nAgha Abdul Karim and some other Baloch separatist leaders such as Qadir Bakhsh Nizamani, Muhammad Hussain Anqa, Malik Saeed Dehwar, and Moulvi Muhammad Afzal, went to Afghanistan in May 1948, to obtain material and financial support from the Afghan government and the Soviet Union, but they failed to obtain any financial or military assistance although Prince Abdul Karim was granted refuge in Afghanistan Afghan government wanted to rather annex Balochistan as it was in desperate need of a sea port. Prince Karim failed to get any support from the Afghan government and the local Balochs, who were not interested in rebelling against the government of Pakistan.\n\n\n== Surrender ==\nIn 1950 they came back to Pakistan upon being granted amnesty by some Baloch statesmen and Pakistani government however on his return he was arrested against the truce and was sentenced to ten years in Haripur jail.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nJinnah and his successors allowed Yar Khan to retain his title until the province's dissolution in 1955.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Southern Railway Building is a historic office building located in Washington, D.C. It was built in 1928–1929 by local architect Waddy Butler Wood as the executive headquarters for the Southern Railway. The eleven-story building was designed in the Stripped Classical style with early Art Deco elements, and was constructed with a frame of steel and concrete fronted with limestone and set on a granite base. The site functioned as the railway's headquarters until 1982, when the company merged with the Roanoke, Virginia-based Norfolk and Western Railway. The newly-formed Norfolk Southern Railway moved its headquarters to Norfolk, Virginia, and the Southern Railway Building became privately owned with multiple tenants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Southern Railway Building was constructed with a frame of steel and concrete and faced with limestone, resting on a low granite foundation. The building was designed in a pared down version of Classical Revival, and is separated vertically into a column of three parts: a primary massing of eight stories consisting of a three-story base and five-story shaft, topped by a temple-like setback capital of three stories. The building stands 130 feet (40 m) tall, and its primary 13-bay façade stretches 217 feet (66 m) on 15th Street facing McPherson Square. That façade includes a three-bay recessed entrance of double bronze doors surrounded by a bronze frame and grills and the words \"SOUTHERN RAILWAY\" in stylized capital letters.\nThe primary feature of the building's shaft are pilasters of the giant order that span the structure's four middle floors. Above those, the punched windows of the eighth floor act as a cornice before the three-floor setback. That section, which extends the building's height to the city's 130-foot (40 m) maximum, is separated in its appearance from the rest of the building and includes Doric pilasters flanked by pairs of columns. The overall effect is one of a temple sitting on a base. The building's 11-bay north elevation is similar to that of the east, though there are no pairs of columns on either side of the setback. A 1995 renovation to the building saw three central entrances cut into the ground floor on the north façade; while the doors themselves are modern, the bronze frames and spandrels from the previously existing windows were retained.\nProfessional offices occupy the majority of the building's floors. Street-front entrances provide access to retail space on the ground floor, and the offices are reached via an elevator bank located inside a two-story, marble-lined lobby. A penthouse contains the former offices of the president of the Southern Railway, which as of 2009 included its original fireplace and mantel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jason Sutton (27 February 1968 – 22 April 2024), also known under his stage name as Miss Jason, was an English actor, comedian, drag artist, pantomime dame, and a community and philanthropic activist.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn 27 February 1968, Jason Sutton began performing in drag in Bournemouth in the 1990s. His drag persona was inspired by gay cabaret comedian and singer Phil Starr. Starr bestowed the stage name \"Miss Jason\" on Sutton.\nDrag artist Stephen Richards, who performs under the name Lola Lasagne, told BBC Radio Sussex that, personality wise, \"Miss Jason\" was very much like Sutton himself.\nSutton often performed at the Two Brewers pub in London, but was a resident of the village of Rottingdean near the city of Brighton. He was a long-time performer in the Sunday cabaret at the bar at the Legends Hotel. He was named the best local entertainer in Brighton in 2016.\nAs Miss Jason, Sutton appeared on several television programmes, including the comedy game show Blankety Blank, the reality cooking game show Come Dine With Me, the antiquing game show Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, and Weakest Link.\nSutton was a noted pantomime dame, performing for charity each Christmas. His performances included pantomime at Portsmouth (2016), Bromley (2017), High Wycombe (2018), Richmond (2019), Barnstaple (2021), Stafford (2022), and Brighton (2023). (Sutton was unable to perform in 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown.)\n\n\n== Activism ==\nSutton frequently donated his time and raised funds for LGBTQ causes and for local organizations. Among the more notable recipients were Albert Kennedy Trust, Brighton Rainbow Fund (a fundraising aggregator for the Brighton and Hove LGBTQ community), The Ledward Centre (an LGBTQ community centre and meeting space), The Sussex Beacon (a charity specialising in care and support for people living with HIV), and Terrence Higgins Trust.\nIn July 2015, there was a suspicious package left near the start of the Brighton Pride parade which led to a bomb scare. Sutton, who was hosting a pre-parade breakfast at the Brighton Hotel, helped keep the crowd calm while police investigated the package. Sutton then assisted police in evacuating the crowd in an orderly fashion. In February 2016, Sussex Police Chief Superintendent Nev Kemp presented Sutton with a community award acknowledging the help he gave to law enforcement that day. In part, the citation read: Miss Jason displayed great professionalism and helped to ensure a calm and organised evacuation putting the safety of the local community first.\"\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn the summer of 2020, Sutton began suffering from issues with his balance and from tinnitus. Physicians discovered he had a tumour adjacent to his ear. Treatment left Sutton deaf in his left ear, and the tinnitus affected his ability to listen and to concentrate. An online fundraiser netted £5,678 for hearing aids to help in recovery.\nSutton died after a short illness on 22 April 2024, at the age of 56. He was survived by his partner, Terry Ward.\nG Scene Magazine eulogised him as \"a giant of our community\" and the Brighton Pride organisation called Sutton \"An unsung hero of the community...\" Daniel Sexton of BBC Radio Sussex called him a \"phenomenal\" pantomime player.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBT culture in Brighton and Hove\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiss Jason official webpage",

The range of this species extends from the coast as far inland as the Sierra Nevada mountain range. R. leptocarpha often grows in epiphytic association with Ramalina menziesii. Trebouxia decolorans is its primary algal photobiont. This species was first described in 1858 by Edward Tuckerman from a collection made in Monterey, California.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Slađana Radisavljević (Serbian Cyrillic: Слађана Радисављевић; born 1968) is a Serbian politician. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as a member of the New Democratic Party of Serbia (NDSS).\n\n\n== Private career ==\nRadisavljević is a mathematics teacher living in Kragujevac.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== City delegate (2012) ===\nRadisavljević entered political life as a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). She was first elected to the Kragujevac city assembly in the 2012 Serbian local elections, in which the DSS won five seats. The DSS originally supported Veroljub Stevanović's administration in the city after the election. On 8 June 2012, Radisavljević was appointed to the city's planning and construction committee. She resigned her seat on 7 December 2012.\n\n\n=== 2014 to 2023 ===\nRadisavljević appeared in the ninety-ninth position on the DSS's electoral list in the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election. This was too low a position for election to be a realistic possibility, and the list did not cross the electoral threshold in any event.\nFor the 2016 parliamentary election, the DSS formed an electoral alliance with Dveri. Radisavljević appeared in the eightieth position on their combined list and was not elected when the list won thirteen seats. She also appeared in the third position on a DSS–Dveri list in Kragujevac for the concurrent 2016 Serbian local elections; this list did not cross the electoral threshold.\nThe DSS contested the 2020 parliamentary election at the head of the METLA coalition. Radisavljević appeared in the forty-fourth position on the coalition's list at the republic level and in the fourth position on its list for Kragujevac in the concurrent 2020 local elections. The coalition failed to cross the threshold at either level.\nIn 2021, the DSS became a founding member of the National Democratic Alternative (NADA) coalition. Radisavljević received the eighteenth position on the alliance's list in the 2022 parliamentary election and missed election when the list won fifteen seats. Shortly after the election, the Democratic Party of Serbia changed its name to the New Democratic Party of Serbia. When new elections were called in 2023, Radisavljević was the next NDSS candidate in sequence to enter the assembly in the event of a vacancy.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (2024–present) ===\nRadisavljević was promoted to the fifth position on the NADA list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election and was elected to her first assembly term when the list won thirteen seats. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won the election, the NADA delegates serve in opposition. Radisavljević is now a member of the committee on human and minority rights and gender equality and a deputy member of the health and family committee, the committee on the rights of the child, and the committee on education, science, technological development, and the information society.\nShe was also re-elected to the Kragujevac city assembly in the concurrent 2023 Serbian local elections. In Kragujevac, the NADA parties appeared on a coalition list led by former mayor Veroljub Stevanović that also included the main parties of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition. Radisavljević appeared in the fourth position and was elected when the list won fourteen mandates, finishing second against the SNS alliance. She resigned her seat in the city assembly in February 2024, saying that she wanted to focus on her work as a parliamentarian.\n\n\n== References ==",

Since the 1800s, Karimjee family business ventures have included trade, agriculture, real estate and motor vehicles. Members of the Karimjee family participated in public life with Abdulkarim Yusufali Alibai Karimjee serving as Speaker of the National Assembly from 1956 to 1962. Karimjee Hall was donated by the family to the Dar es Salaam Municipal Council in 1955. It was used at various times as the Legislative Assembly and the Houses of Parliament.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Karimjee family came to Zanzibar when Jivanjee Budhaboy emigrated in the 19th Century from Mandvi, Gujarat. He established a company, Jivanjee Budhaboy & Co., in 1825. Jivanjee Budhaboy & Co sold copra and cloves to India and brought American and German cloth to East Africa.\nJivanjee Budhaboy had four sons, three of whom are in the family records as adults: Ebrahimjee, Esmailjee and Karimjee Jivanjee (1826–1898).\nThe three brothers separated their business interests in 1861 and Karimjee Jivanjee set up his own business in Zanzibar, Karimjee Jivanjee & Co. He had four sons: Abdulhussein Karimjee Jivanjee (1870–1892), Hassanali Karimjee Jivanjee (1872–1918), Mohamedali Karimjee Jivanjee (1876–1940), and Yusufali Karimjee Jivanjee (1882–1966).\nKarimjee Jivanjee & Co continued to operate as Zanzibar became a British Protectorate in 1820 and Tanganyika followed suit in 1919 after the end of World War I. The company traded mainly in agricultural products and textiles, importing goods from Germany, India and the Far East and exporting goods to those same countries as well as The Seychelles, Mauritius and Ceylon. Karimjee Jivanjee & Co owned a vast fleet of dhows which were used especially to trade with ports up and down the Swahili Coast.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKarimjee Jivanjee page in Dawoodi Bohras Website",

        "content": "Youth Culture Forever is the second album by Scottish band Paws. It was released on 2 June 2014 on FatCat Records.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nPaws' debut album Cokefloat! was released on FatCat Records in October 2012.\nIn spring 2013 bassist Matthew Scott left the band, and Ryan Drever took his place. Paws toured the US and UK extensively in 2013, playing shows with We Were Promised Jetpacks, Frightened Rabbit, Fucked Up, and Little Big League,\nas well as festivals including SXSW, Seaport Music Festival, and T in the Park.\nYouth Culture Forever was recorded in late 2013 in upstate New York.\nTaylor said that compared to their debut, Paws \"wished to spend that little bit more time on emphasising the dynamics in the new songs that we've crafted. Experimenting with new instruments in overdubbing for a touch of depth.\" He told Spin that \"before we just went in and blasted the songs out. But this time it’s been nice to think about placements and stuff.\" Taylor's vocals were intentionally muffled by recording them on a Talkboy.\nYouth Culture Forever was released on CD and LP by FatCat Records on 2 June 2014. In Japan, the album was released on Thomason Sounds, and included the 2012 EP Misled Youth as bonus tracks. The title of the album is a quote from Finn the Human of Adventure Time.\nThe tracks \"Tongues\" and \"Owls Talons Clenching My Heart\" were released as singles in early 2014.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nOn Metacritic the album holds a score of 69/100, based on 7 reviews, indicating a \"generally favorable\" reception.\nSteve Mcgillivray of Louder Than War wrote that \"a real standout aspect is Philip Taylor's brutally honest songwriting...this is an album that deserves to be heard widely.\" Clash called the album \"enlivening, inspiring, frustrating and maddening in equal measure\", and noted a more raw production compared to their debut. Billy Hamilton of Under the Radar  wrote that \"while it's hardly adventurous, there's plenty of thrill on offer.\"\nAs with Paws' debut Cokefloat!, reviewers noted an influence of 90s grunge on Youth Culture Forever. Jeremy Gorden of Pitchfork wrote that \"you can pinpoint PAWS' 90s alt rock influences from a mile away — there's a bit of Mascis, Malkmus, Cuomo, and the like.\" DIY said that \"PAWS haven’t lost their 90s alt-rock sound...but they've beefed it up considerably.\"\nYouth Culture Forever was shortlisted for the 2015 Scottish Album of the Year Award.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaws\n\nPhillip Jon Taylor – vocals, guitar, lyrics\nJosh Swinney – drums\nRyan Drever – bass\nOther credits\n\nIsabel Castellvi – cello on \"Erreur Humaine\", \"Owls Talons Clenching My Heart\", and \"Alone\"\nAdam Pierce – piano on \"Tongues\"\nTechnical\n\nJeremy Backofen, Paws – production\nAlan Douches – mastering\nPeter Katis – mixing\nArtistic\n\nJill Collins – illustration\nGracie Magee, Josh Swinney – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

The Khan of Khiva, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur and his son Anusha Khan took advantage of such conditions and attacked Bukhara, but in 1657, Abd al-Aziz Khan defeated the Khan of Khiva.\nDuring the reign of Abd al-Aziz Khan, the diplomatic and commercial relations of the Khanate of Bukhara with Russia, Iran and India flourished. In 1669, he sent an embassy headed by Mullah Farrukh to Russia to Tsar Alexis of Russia.\nIn response, in 1670, a Russian embassy headed by the Pazukhin brothers was sent to Bukhara.\n\n\n=== Policy in the field of culture ===\nDuring the reign of Abd al-Aziz Khan, a madrasa named after him was built in Bukhara and the Tilya Kori Madrasa in Samarkand.\nHe was described as a \"brave, generous, science-loving Khan\". He collected a library of copies of beautiful manuscripts.\n\n\n=== Abdication and death ===\nThe long war with Khiva stained the reputation of Abd al-Aziz Khan and he was forced to hand over the throne to his brother Subhan Quli Khan in 1680.\nAbdul Aziz Khan died in 1683 while performing the Hajj in Mecca.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHoworth, Henry Hoyle.

        "content": "Ilie Purcaru (November 5, 1933 – October 10, 2008) was a Romanian journalist and poet, much of whose writing was in support of the communist regime. A native of Oltenia region, he had an early debut in the Romanian Communist Party press, and was hailed as a child prodigy in the realm of poetry; he then helped re-establish the Craiova-based magazine Ramuri, which he also directed. Partnering up with Miron Radu Paraschivescu, he provoked communist censorship by publishing Onirist poets, as well as by cultivating former fascists. He was nevertheless largely compatible with the regime's national-communist turn; as a pioneer of the reportage genre, he expanded on influences from Geo Bogza and Tudor Arghezi to create a new, distinctly poetic, language of propaganda. In tandem, Purcaru visited Southeast Asia as a press correspondent, being a personal witness to the Vietnamese and Laotian Wars.\nThough widely seen as a gifted writer even in the realm of propaganda, Purcaru elicited an enduring controversy by veering into the extremes of national-communism, which came with his embracing the views and the linguistic violence of Protochronism. While he remained a relative moderate in this camp, and published an interview with the anti-Protochronist Nicolae Manolescu, he was still treasured by the regime, and as such served in official capacities until the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Embroiled in a corruption scandal, and barred from working in the press, he was defended by Adrian Păunescu, and employed by him at Flacăra. Especially in that context, Purcaru began exploring the life of peasants, described by him as icons of honesty; he also added to the controversy surrounding his life by making repeated contributions to Nicolae Ceaușescu's personality cult. \nThis standing in national-communist literature came alongside a belated return to poetry, with verse that was praised for its tender, bookish, humorous touches. Purcaru remained active after the Revolution, especially as the editor of short-lived publications, one of which was published by the Democratic Laborists. He was reportedly ready to accept the regime change, but found himself shunned by the literary mainstream. In old age, he also joined a new publishing venture launched by Păunescu in opposition to Flacăra. Before his death, Purcaru was reediting his earlier works, issuing the complete notebooks of his journeys in North Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nPurcaru was in the Oltenian city of Râmnicu Vâlcea, then part of the Kingdom of Romania, as the son of Ioan Purcaru and his wife Aurora (née Năchescu), both of whom were schoolteachers; the couple also had a daughter, Georgeta. The family's family roots were in other parts of Oltenia: Aurora was a native of Târgu Cărbunești, and Ioan hailed from Craiova. The family moved to the latter city when Ilie was aged seven. He attended primary school during World War II (from 1940 to 1944) and, from 1944 to 1950, Frații Buzești High School in Craiova. He made his debut during the early stages of the communist regime (originally called \"Romanian People's Republic\"), though literary historian Dumitru Micu provides two different dates and contexts: either in 1949, with prose published in Craiova's Caiet Literar, or the following year, with poems taken up by the central magazine Contemporanul. \nFrom 1950 to 1951, Purcaru studied at the Mihai Eminescu Literature School in Bucharest, being possibly its youngest-ever student. One anonymous report filed with the Union of Working Youth had was also one of several inductees who had decided to drop out of high school, since \"now that they're writers, they [believe that they] no longer need the high school\". One of his colleagues was the future novelist Aurel Rău, who recalls that Purcaru was regarded as holding \"great promise\". During the later stages of communism, the Eminescu School's activity came to be seen as \"highly controversial\". In a 1985 interview with Mihai Ungheanu, Purcaru acknowledged this as a fact, but added: \"this school has also produced some writers. People who have rescued and then imposed themselves with their own talent, but also through the help provided by this school.\" One of Purcaru's older schoolmates, Alexandru Andrițoiu, declared that Purcaru himself was already an \"exemplary\" poet, whose verse stood out from the rest in \"that barren dogmatic era\". His period there was nevertheless extended by his induction into the official literary current of Socialist realism (also known as the Romanian \"Proletkult\"); the official press sampled his poetic work, as \"vibrant with the love for the country that is being built\":\n\nThough still an adolescent, Purcaru was made an editor at the Communist Party's daily, Scînteia, staying there from 1951 to 1957. As noted by literary historian Ana Selejan, he was one of that publication's \"top reporters\", and one of the few to have taken up the reportage genre without first going through a fiction-writing stage. She lists Purcaru among other examples of men and women who entered literature by way of Scînteia, including Maria Banuș, Dan Deșliu, Petru Dumitriu, and Victor Bârlădeanu. Their contribution, she adds, were rarely commented on by the regime's literary press, and was mainly regarded as a subset of agitprop, with a \"mobilizing, educational effect\", only differing in that they required actual travels out in the field. Purcaru himself contributed such texts upon visiting Doicești (1951) and the building site of Bicaz Power Station (1953). His direct superior at Scînteia was Sorin Toma, with whom he did not get along. In old age, Purcaru recalled that, on his first day, Toma asked him to extend his hand and, upon noticing that it was trembling, asked him: \"What is it that you're not disclosing to the [communist] party?\" Toma, who survived Purcaru, dismissed the account as inaccurate, and advanced instead the claim that Purcaru, like many others of his employees, was a high-functioning alcoholic; if he was checking Purcaru's hands, it was in a search for signs of intoxication. Also according to Toma, Purcaru was a \"very handsome\" young man, who was well-liked by the communist leader, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In order not to disappoint the latter by revealing that Purcaru did not meet ethical standards, Scînteia made efforts to conceal his drinking habits.\nAs one of his last assignments at Scînteia, Purcaru traveled into the Soviet Union—to cover the Vnukovo International Airport incident which had resulted in the death of a Romanian communist official, Grigore Preoteasa. Around 1958, Purcaru and his lifelong friend Paul Anghel co-wrote a poem, subsequently taken up by George Ivașcu in Contemporanul. An anonymous source reported to the Securitate and the communist censors that the piece was \"surrealistic\", which resulted in both authors being barred from publishing for a couple of years. Anghel was further repressed because of his marriage to the film director Malvina Urșianu, who was suspected by the authorities of being an anticommunist opinion-maker, and detained as such in 1958. Ultimately released later that year, Urșianu credited Purcaru as one of the people who spoke out in her support. In 1960–1961, Purcaru had an editorial position at Contemporanul, now working directly under Ivașcu. His colleagues there included Felicia Antip, who recalled that Ivașcu \"never forced authors he respected to write any sort of mendacious, agitprop text [...]. That area was zealously covered by a clique of editors and contributors, comprising Vasile Băran [and] Ilie Purcaru\". \nDuring summer 1961, Purcaru was assigned to do his documentary research in Iași Region. He later moved offices to Luceafărul, where he worked from 1962 to 1964. During this time, he traveled the Wallachian Plain to document the harvest; his contribution was included in the 1963 book Moment istoric, wherein various writers offered praise to the collectivization of agriculture. It was also then that he began his work as an interviewer, centering it on senior literary figures. In a 1983 piece, literary critic Alexandru Oprea described this contribution as commendable, \"in the tradition of a genre constructed by Felix Aderca and Ion Biberi\". Also then, journalist Nicolae Georgescu assessed that a 1962 interview with George Călinescu, taken by Purcaru and Ștefan Bănulescu, was still a Luceafărul milestone.\n\n\n=== Ramuri and Vietnam ===\nDescribed by Micu as a born reporter, Purcaru was interested in the most varied contemporary issues. Micu also notes that Purcaru's early years were marked by a predominance of romantic, exalted tones, producing several works: Zile fierbinți (1955, with V. Negru), Calitatea producției — onoarea fabricii (1956), Focuri în junglă (1957), Ev nou în Țara Banilor (1961), Harpe și ape. Album dunărean (1962), Escale spre noi înșine (1966). Straddling the rules of Gheorghiu-Dej and Nicolae Ceaușescu, most of these expand on the notion of ev nou (\"new era\") as a descriptor for Romania's communization. Some of these cover more than one volume, presenting as a form of \"monographic reportage\". As noted by Micu, Ev nou în Țara Banilor transcends the \"conventionality and opportunism\" of regular communist writings by embracing subtlety and expanding the means of expression—from historical and sociological essay to prose poem; he detects in it echoes from Tudor Arghezi's modern hymns and from Geo Bogza's classic reportage pieces, but also foreshadows of the 1980s propaganda festival, Cîntarea României. Literary critic Alex. Ștefănescu regards Purcaru and Traian T. Coșovei as \"Bogza's epigones\". They had only borrowed Bogza's \"poetic-bombastic style\" while ignoring his other trait, namely a \"remarkable concreteness\". Purcaru himself specialized in geographic similes, comparing Oltenia to a bow and (in Harpe și ape) the whole of Romania to a harp, with rivers as the strings. Micu defends such metaphors as still charming, but acknowledges that Purcaru doused them in a \"heavily politicized discourse, reflecting the communist spirit\", thus leaving his readers with a \"feeling of disgust\" (sentiment de lehamite). Other books had a more pronounced intellectual stance, beginning with the 1964 Colocvii. Artistul și opera sa, de la I. L. Caragiale la Eugen Barbu, where writers were his theme.\nWhile serving as chief editor of the Craiova newspaper Înainte, Purcaru was the founder and first editor of Ramuri magazine, appearing as a publication of Craiova Region's Committee for Culture and the Arts in 1964. He soon brought in at Ramuri other authors who favored the reportage genre—examples include Anghel, Adrian Păunescu, and Mihai Pelin. Here, Purcaru began testing the limits of communist liberalization—under his watch, Miron Radu Paraschivescu founded a supplement, Povestea Vorbei, which published dissenting authors of the Onirist group and other independents. By 1967, the Securitate had planted an informant in Paraschivescu's summer home at Vălenii de Munte, observing him in conversations with his guests. These included writers Purcaru, Sidonia Drăgușanu, Dumitru Țepeneag and Alexandru Voitinovici, as well as the communist potentate Gogu Rădulescu. Purcaru's journalistic contribution was still rewarded in 1964, when he was inducted into the Order of Labor (Ordinul Muncii), Third Class; it also won him the annual prize of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth (UTC) for 1967.\nIn 1966–1967, Purcaru was an accredited press correspondent in the Vietnam War, described from the North Vietnamese side (which also provided him with bodyguards). In his memoirs, journalist Constantin Poenaru records legends about his departure. According to these, Purcaru had volunteered after being told that he was dying from cirrhosis. \"By who knows what miracle\", he only managed to cure his disease during his extended leave. He and his wife lived in Hanoi for those two years, during which time a son was born to them. Purcaru's texts are \"filled with dramatic detail, and with tragedies hardly imaginable just two decades after humanity had known the horrors of World War II\"; some recount his direct experience of Operation Rolling Thunder, during which he hid out in caves. While prevented by the Romanian Embassy from even setting foot in South Vietnam (he would only visit Ho Chi Minh City in the 1980s), Purcaru traveled from Hanoi to Vientiane to chronicle the Laotian Civil War. He managed to interview Souphanouvong, but, according to his personal notebooks, was not trusted by Souphanouvong's Pathet Lao, which kept him under close surveillance. He recalled being put off by the regularity of American bombing in Laos, as it had affected an already destitute people. He himself had to take shelter with regular Laotians in caves outside Xam Neua. The notebooks also detail his encounter with the isolated Miao people, whom he came to admire for their \"purity of blood\" and military prowess. \nIn June 1967, Purcaru was interviewed by the UTC's Scînteia Tineretului, to provide it with insight into his writing process. He expressed his admiration for Bogza, but noted that the latter's contributions of 1945 were also a \"solemn funeral\" of the genre—every other such work published since had been copying \"a foreign model, arrived here from some place, the sort of place where there are no opinions, and no actual press, and no actual reportage\". The censorship apparatus picked this out as a reference to Soviet propaganda, and the corresponding fragment was cut out of the interview. Ramuri itself was kept under watch by Securitate agents, with one of their anonymous sources reporting that the editorial staff's \"lack of vigilance and discernment\" had led to the publication therein of a note praising Nae Ionescu, hitherto reviled as a pillar of the fascist Iron Guard. The Securitate document also claimed that the magazine had also nearly published works by political suspects, including former Guardists and a one-time member of the National Christian Party. In the Romanian diaspora, philosopher Mircea Eliade, who had been an Ionescu disciple, declared his surprise, adding a note of skepticism: he feared that \"such 'excesses' might be used by the Stalinists (or whatever they're called) to turn the screws back on them.\" \nAs a journalist at Înainte, Purcaru was one of the reporters who were assigned to travel the country in Ceaușescu's motorcades. His contribution to that newspaper is believed to have remained timid in its approach to censorship. This was attested by the essayist and former political prisoner Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu, according to whom: \"[Purcaru] would not publish me [there], knowing that I did not have the right to publish or the right of signature, as sympathetic as he was towards me, until he was granted permission to do so, and that's when they published my article about the icon-thieves in Brâncuși's village.\" The editor was still publicly anti-Soviet down to a fracas which occurred at a restaurant on Palace Square during late April 1969. Purcaru was drinking in the company of several journalists, including Vartan Arachelian, when they noticed that Soviet tourists were seated in their proximity; being annoyed by this and by their activity of the time, which was mainly focused on writing a \"festive issue\" for the International Workers' Day, they proceeded to sing forbidden and provocative songs (including Trăiască Regele, \"Lili Marleen\", and an Iron Guard hymn). The incident resulted in permanent surveillance by the Securitate for a one-year interval, as well as in a number of administrative sanctions. The instigators were dressed down by the Minister of Youth, Ion Iliescu, who chided the teetotaler Arachelian for having allowed Purcaru to sing, instead of \"slapping him once or twice\".\n\n\n=== Protochronist turn and Flacăra ===\n\nIn mid-1969, Purcaru was replaced at Ramuri with the academic Alexandru Piru, who steered that magazine away from reportage-writing, promoting instead literary theory and history. Around 1970, Purcaru made visits to the island of Ada Kaleh, which was soon after submerged into the Danube upon the construction of an Iron Gates hydroelectric dam. Like his colleagues Pelin and Coșovei, he wrote texts in support of the controlled destruction—all three writers argued that the island was merely a relic of the past, standing in the way of industrial progress. From 1972 to 1973, he was deputy editor-in-chief at Înainte, holding a similar post at Scînteia Tineretului (1973–1974). He was then editor at Argeș magazine in 1974, and in 1974–1975 served as deputy editor-in-chief at Tribuna României, where Anghel was the manager. The interviews of Poezii și politică, put out by Editura Albatros in 1972, was applauded by reviewer George Pruteanu for its value as a \"rare documentary\"—since it included encounters with Paraschivescu, Petre Pandrea and Ion Vinea, all of whom had since died; overall, Pruteanu notes, the interviews doubled as \"scenarios for intellectual disputes.\" The book also featured his talks with Păunescu, who had recently returned from a study trip in the United States, and expanded on themes of socialist patriotism. Therein, Păunescu explained himself as a committed left-winger, whose politics had been shaped by Paraschivescu, and who was therefore \"terrified by some aspects of American culture\": \"Americans want money, money, money! They would pursue any business even if it contradicted their personal beliefs.\"\nPurcaru returned to intellectual themes in a speculative book, România – convergențe la universal (1975), published alongside new works in the reportage genre: Țara Banilor (1972), Un elefant pentru doi oameni (1973), and Asaltul (1974). Literary scholar Eugen Negrici identifies him, Păunescu and Anghel, alongside Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor, as the journalists and writers most prone to serving the regime's national-communist propaganda after 1975. According to Negrici, these authors readily agreed to make the transition away from \"honest reviews\" of Romanian nationalism and into the realm of outright falsification. American anthropologist Katherine Verdery, who visited Romania in the 1980s, studied Purcaru as an exponent of \"Protochronism\", which constituted the most radical form of national-communism, by presuming Romanian world-primacy in various fields of culture. In his own words, Purcaru was rebelling against a \"defeatist doctrine that divides the world into major and minor cultures\", adding: \"Protochronism seeks the annulment of norms that place a literature in excessive creative dependence and subordination to the values of other literatures.\" He was nevertheless among those who extended an offer of collaboration to the advocates of full Westernization, also called \"Synchronists\", in that he believed that the two currents shared the same ultimate agenda.\nPoenaru, who witnessed Purcaru's return trips to Râmnicu Vâlcea, notes that he continued to feed his alcohol problem by \"engag[ing] in lengthy libations\", to the point of neglecting his work. According to the same source, he would always collect his money in advance, spend them, then write his articles on the preceding night, scribbling them down in a small notebook. Purcaru's career was for a while threatened—according to Păunescu, he \"was fired from all places\", despite being a \"great journalist.\" Verdery contrarily reports that the regime allowed Purcaru to engage in acts of corruption: \"the protochronists were generally rescued from above in the numerous scrapes they got themselves into. [...] Paul Anghel and Ilie Purcaru were involved in a scandal concerning misappropriation of foreign currency from a journal they edited; yet although they were fired, their careers proceeded apace.\" From 1975 to 1987, Purcaru served as the editor of Flacăra weekly, having been brought there by Păunescu. \nMicu notes that Purcaru's youthful romanticism had become more subdued in the collection Paralaxe la \"Miorița\" (1978); other works of the period include Încă 3 km până la Apele Vii (1976) and Planuri în lut (1979). Paralaxe was one of several works by Purcaru which provided a minute, monographic investigation of peasant life. Covering the work for Scînteia Tineretului, Ștefănescu recognized Bogza's influence, and declared himself put off by Purcaru's occasional \"grandiloquence\", but asserted that, overall, the book showed its author's \"fantasy and sensibility\", as well as an \"authenticity of the lyrical élan\". During his research, Purcaru had traveled to the Transylvanian village of Drăguș, retracing the steps of sociologist Henri H. Stahl, and meeting an unusually strong and industrious local, Bacioc, who had spent decades building himself a gigantic log house. Încă 3 km gathered impressions of his time with the peasants and rural craftsmen of Oltenia, with incursions in Arcani, Fîntîna Domnească, Runcu, and the eponymous Apele Vii. He described the fading-out of superstitions (by interviewing a peasant who had once believed that the sun was like \"the mouth of a barrel\"), the quick adoption of modern tools, but also the \"fundamental honesty\" of peasants. In Planuri în lut and other writings, Purcaru is visibly alarmed by the destitution of ancestral villages in his native Vâlcea County, and especially in the isolated sub-region known as Țara Loviștei.\nThe reporter occasionally gave way to the poet, as with the volumes Bunica Beps (1974) and Geografii rebele (1984), and the commemorative piece Marșul de August (1980). Only the first of these three volumes is noted by Micu, who remarks that it relied on \"tenderness, expressed with an intellectual humor of a bookish source\"; it earned the author another prize, granted by the Bucharest Writers' Association. Purcaru suffused this work with intertexual allusions to diverse authors of the 20th century—from Ștefan Octavian Iosif to Ion Barbu, Mateiu Caragiale, Radu Stanca, and especially George Călinescu. In an interview with Alice Diana Boboc, Purcaru would acknowledge the more playful side of his nature, including as a reporter, describing himself overall as a \"good-natured fella\". He also noted that poetry remained a pastime: \"I am not one of those fortunate enough to be visited by poetic inspiration on a daily basis. It won't even visit me on Sundays.\" His colleague Artur Silvestri once portrayed him as the \"physical embodiment of the Oltenian writer\": \"short, slender, energetic with his irritability, his gesturing impetuous, interrogative\".\n\n\n=== Literatură și națiune ===\nPurcaru continued to receive awards, such as the Writers' Union of Romania Prize (1975) and the Craiova Writers' Association Prize (1980). His contribution at Flacăra included a 1981 exposé on some unpunished acts of mobbing. Though intended as a way of getting the authorities involved, it inspired Norman Manea to write his novel Plicul negru, which was a covert critique of Ceaușescu's supremacy. Purcaru himself was supportive of Ceaușescu's personality cult, with contributions to a 1983 Festschrift called Omagiu președintelui țării, which was Oltenian-centered and put out by Scrisul Românesc of Craiova. The text, which included an account of Purcaru's visit to the Conducător's home village in Scornicești, was critically reread in 2006 by writer Angelo Mitchievici: \"Ilie Purcaru gets strongly emotional [...]. The reporter, aided by the testimonials of simple folk, but also by those of [party] activists, reconstructs the history of this ancestral homeland, which has reached an unprecedented prosperity under the Gilded Epoch.\" Purcaru claimed to have witnessed the locals' enthusiasm about the effects of collectivization; he also reported his meeting with a mother of eleven, who had recollections about the Ceaușescu as a young communist being taken away by the old-regime Gendarmes. As noted by Mitchievici, the narrative presented itself as unwitting evidence of national-communist \"Messianism\".\nPurcaru spent much of that period interviewing other writers for Flacăra: in June 1983, he also became the last person to converse about literature with the ailing and exhausted Nichita Stănescu, recording \"hints of a [Stănescu] testament\". His 1981 conversation with Ion Lăncrănjan was affected by censorship, which cut out details on current politics and the formation of writer's \"groups\"—though all such mentions could appear in Purcaru's collection, appearing in 1986 at Editura Eminescu as Literatură și națiune. The volume included Purcaru's own thoughts on the literary and political dispute between national-communists and liberals. As noted by Verdery, Purcaru, as man of the former clique, had developed \"one powerful way of undermining others' cultural representativeness\", which was to \"accuse them of 'elitism'.\" Further, \"[his] message to a cognizant public is that it should reject the sorts of readings offered by these 'elitists,' who allegedly hold the intelligence of common readers and the values of rural folk in contempt.\" The same discourse was employed by his interviewee Silvestri, who argued that those seeking to \"depoliticize\" literature were subject to ideological commands received from Radio Free Europe, and as such no less political then the national-communists.\nLiteratură și națiune was published at a time when disputes between liberals (who criticized Ceaușescu) and national-communists (who endorsed him) were turning increasingly virulent; the liberals accused their adversaries of being crypto-fascists, while the national-communists became interested in exposing the liberals for being frequently Jewish. Siding with the national-communist intellectuals, a Securitate source alleged, already in 1980, that Purcaru and other Protochronists had found themselves marginalized as the \"New Right\" by intriguers, namely \"a nonconformist group created around România Literară magazine, especially [including] those writers who are of Jewish nationality\". Purcaru's interviews are analyzed by Verdery as an important piece of evidence regarding the magnitude of cultural debates under late-stage communism; in that context, he \"provoked his interlocutors with leading questions about how 'certain critics' had attacked their work\". The interviewees' language, she notes, had descended to \"a level of linguistic violence suited only to a full-scale societal crisis.\" Although the Lăncrănjan interview appeared without cuts, this was probably not the case with other portions of the book. As reported by Verdery, the text featured \"outrageous\" attacks on the Writers' Union, for which reason Editura Eminescu \"refused it outright\". I was afterwards \"pressured into accepting it, but only after cutting some interviews and toning down others.\" In the book itself, Purcaru had hinted that there was a conspiracy \"against reediting certain writers; some of his protochronist interlocutors agreed with his opinions but others of them pointed to the quite objective difficulties of editing one or another writer's work.\"\nIn its published form, Literatură și națiune still featured occasional answers from the liberal side, including one provided by România Literară's Nicolae Manolescu. The latter was allowed to describe his own version of patriotism (implicitly defending himself against national-communist labels on his work), and also insisted that Protochronism, as a variant of patriotism, was flawed: \"Our pride should not consist in being first but in being great.\" As Verdery notes, Manolescu hinted that the best way of dealing with his adversaries was to \"refuse them a dialogue\". Unwittingly, the Manolescu–Purcaru encounter also showed a number of similarities between the two opposing camps, since they were both irked by the state of cultural management by the Ceaușescu's Party: \"They reflect real and understandable frustration at the reduced number of publications and the stiff competition to get one's works into print, a process in which it was insinuated that 'certain critics' or writers had undue influence (even though the real cause lay in the Party's cultural policy).\"\n\n\n=== 1989 Revolution and later life ===\nInterviewing Purcaru shortly before the Romanian Revolution toppled communism, Verdery noted that he still produced some of \"the most extreme protochronist statements\"—on par with those by Anghel, Barbu, Lăncrănjan, Silvestri and Tudor, and much more radical than those aired by Păunescu or Constantin Noica. In the mid-1986, he and fellow Protochronist Mihai Ungheanu wrote in support of Romania's conflict with the Hungarian People's Republic, specifically arguing that the Csángós in Western Moldavia were \"a de-nationalised community of ethnic Romanians\"—supporting on this the theories produced by Dumitru Mărtinaș, a grade-school teacher. Almost a full year year ahead of the Revolution, Purcaru was again endorsing the personality cult, appearing as a narrator of the propaganda film Sub arcul de lumină al Epocii de aur (aired on national television just ahead of Ceaușescu's birthday).\nPurcaru sought work in the post-revolutionary press, and, as early as January 1990, was a contributor to the newly launched Democrația daily. He was then editor-in-chief of several short-lived publications, beginning in April 1990 with Fapta magazine. This was an also an organ of the Democratic Party of Labor, with an editorial staff which also included Protochronists Ungheanu and Ilie Bădescu (prompting the staff chronicler at România Literară to remark that it was \"the defunct Luceafărul, rising out of its ashes\"). Purcaru was later employed by Națiunea daily newspaper (1990–1991), then by România Internațională magazine (1992), România Magazin (1993), and Regăsirea (1997). His contribution to propaganda was retrospectively reviewed by the anticommunist culture-critic Virgil Ierunca, in the 1994 essay Dimpotrivă. Ierunca dismissed his work as \"state-run lying, with fervor and ineffable cynicism\". Fellow journalist Șerban Cionoff argues that Purcaru sincerely welcomed the change of regime, though it proceeded to marginalize him: \"the spot that should have been reserved for betterment and for solidarity toward a durable creativity was taken by hatred, by murkiness, by a vigilantism of the Taliban rite\". \nPurcaru's final contributions to poetry were grouped as Mauzoleul Bunicii Beps, appearing in 1999. Also that year, George Arion published a book of interviews, which included one with Purcaru. In 2001, he joined Păunescu's writing team at Flacăra lui Adrian Păunescu, which was founded in opposition to the old Flacăra. Victor Rusu, a former colleague in the communist press who had settled in Israel, exchanged letters with Purcaru, publishing them in 2007. These reveal Purcaru's frustration at having to work as a \"mercenary\" for the conceited Păunescu, especially since the job which required \"never stepping on the turf of any of the boss' partisans\". He also complained that his much younger colleagues were poorly educated, \"scatterbrained, stammering as writers, at odds with logic and grammar, always but always miffed, unfed, and disabused.\" The former reporter republished all his Danube-themed prose as the volume Eu și Dunărea, appearing at Floarea Albastră of Bucharest in 2003. In December 2005, Ramuri celebrated its centennial (counted from the first edition of 1905). The ceremony, attended by Manolescu on bahalf of the Writers' Union, saw Purcaru receiving a special award in recognition for his work. He also made return trips to his native city, where, in 2006, he reissued and completed some of his Vietnam-era writings, as Coșmar în junglă—published by the local company, Antim Ivireanul. He died in Bucharest on October 10, 2008, weeks before his 75th birthday, and was survived by a daughter, Anda. In 2013, Antim Ivireanul also issued Pro Honorem, a collection of texts in memory of Purcaru.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMarian Barbu, \"Pecete literară de ziarist profesionist\", in Destine Literare, Vol. 5, Issue 4, August 2010, pp. 3–6.\nRomanița Constantinescu, Pași pe graniță.

Five further new species were described. The species Heptathela sinensis had been described in 1932 based on a female specimen, and transferred to the new genus Sinothela in 2003 based on a male specimen that cannot be confidently matched to the female, so the authors of Luthela regard both Sinothela sinensis and Sinothela to be nomina dubia (dubious names). Accordingly, two species that had been placed in Sinothela were transferred to Luthela. Three further new species were added to the genus in 2023.\n\n\n=== Species ===\nAs of April 2024, the World Spider Catalog accepted the following extant species:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Teresa Torrelles Espina (27 May 1908 – 18 May 1991) was a Catalan trade unionist, anarcha-feminist activist and hospital administrator. Having worked in the textile industry from an early age, Torrelles joined the anarcho-syndicalist movement at the age of 16. She moved to Terrassa, where she organised a local women's group, which established a libertarian library and secular school. She successfully pushed for the adoption of working women's demands, such as equal pay for equal work and maternity leave, by the local branch of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). She also helped establish the Mujeres Libres, the women's organisation of the CNT. During the Spanish Civil War, she worked as a hospital administrator, overseeing the construction of a clinic with a functioning maternity ward in Terrassa. After the war, she fled to France, then Argentina and Venezuela, before moving back to France, where she died in 1991.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and activism ===\nTeresa Torrelles i Espiano was born on 27 May 1908, in the Catalan village of Nalec, the daughter of Josep Torrelles and Teresa Espina. Her parents worked as farmers on a vineyard, but in 1914, they were forced to move after an outbreak of phylloxera. They settled in Esparreguera, where the whole family worked in the textile plant at Colònia Sedó. At the age of 16, in 1924, Torrelles joined an anarcho-syndicalist group. It was here that she met her partner Joan Graells, with whom she had a daughter, Marisol. The group was taught by Joan Roigé, a disciple of Francesc Ferrer and a member of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT).\n\n\n=== Labour organising ===\nIn 1928, moved to the city of Terrassa, where she found work in the textile industry and became more involved in the anarchist movement. She established a local women's group, within which she helped set up a libertarian library and a secular school, to which she invited the rationalist teacher Antonia Maymón to lecture. Torrelles' women's group affiliated with the textile workers' union of the CNT and began holding meetings at a local cultural centre of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI), where they discussed issues they wanted to raise collectively at union assemblies. As the group's main leader, she took a prominent role in organising women that worked in the city's textile industry.\nThe group developed a strong anarchist feminist tendency, which was honed over a series of debates and lectures on a variety of topics. They also organised tours of the countryside, in order to encourage closer companionship and a love of nature, and excursions to other cities, where they networked with other anarchist and feminist groups. During a general strike in Barcelona in 1930, she smuggled weapons and ammunition into the capital, concealed beneath her coat, and distributed them to anarchist workers at La Rambla.\nBy the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, the group had succeeded in getting the CNT's local branch to take up its demands of equal pay for equal work and maternity leave. But this was an exceptional case, as very few of the CNT's unions adopted these demands; Torrelles herself attributes their success in Terrassa to the strength of the women's group there, where working women weren't as well-organised in other parts of the country. The Terrassa women's group itself continued to educate and organise working women throughout the 1930s. In 1936, Torrelles participated in the founding of the Mujeres Libres, the CNT's own women's organisation, for which she organised conferences and wrote a number of anarcha-feminist articles.\n\n\n=== Health administration during the civil war ===\nIn the first days of the Spanish Civil War, the Terrassa women's group established a nursing school and an emergency clinic to treat wounded fighters. They outfitted the clinic with beds from their own houses, and were aided in their efforts by voluntary donations, as well as resources requisitioned from the local government. She reported that, on the first day of the war: \n\nI went to the operating room, and looked around. I put things in their places, and saw what we needed. And then I went to City Hall and said, this and this is what we need... They either gave it to me or arranged for me to get it. If we needed alcohol, for example, I went to the pharmacy and got it, with money they gave me, because we had nothing, not even disinfectant.\nTorrelles became an apprentice of the CNT physician Juan Paulís, under whom she established the city's first maternity clinic. Due to her experience in labour organising, she was quickly appointed as the hospital administrator. She reported that the job was difficult, as many of the health workers were reluctant to adjust to her anarchist way of doing things:\n\nThe midwives - there were twelve of them - went on strike. They refused to work for us... When they returned to work, they would eat first and give the women who had given birth what was left over. I said, \"This can­not be.\" So I took the food and took it around to the patients, and what was left, I took to the kitchen for the nurses and midwives. We used diapers with buttons, instead of pins, because Dr. Paulís said that the pins weren't safe for the babies, I had to arrange that, too...  I remember how many times fathers would come up to me in the clinic to request something, and I would say, \"Please, here all of us are equals.\" And they would say to me, \"Here, you really have made the revolution.\" I had such satisfaction from this. Because I administered the whole thing without any education... What I believed, that's what I put in practice there... And that's what I can tell you of what I did for the revolution. The rest, I did what everyone else did. But this, this was something I did.\nShe held this position throughout the war, even after joining the Terrassa Town Council. In October 1938, she was nominated by the Barcelona branch of the Mujeres Libres to be their secretary for propaganda, but she declined the nomination. That same month, her partner Joan Graells was killed while fighting in the Battle of the Ebro.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nShe lived in Terrassa until January 1939, when the Nationalists' Catalonia Offensive forced her to flee the country. Torrelles crossed over the France–Spain border carrying nothing but the clothes she wore. She was held in a concentration camp in Clermont-Ferrand, then transferred to another in Argelers. During World War II, she collaborated with the French Resistance.\nTogether with her 15-year-old daughter Marisol, in 1948, she moved to Argentina, where she joined the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA). In 1958, she moved to Venezuela. She lived in Caracas, where she participated in the publication of the Libertarian Youth's magazine Ruta, until 1966, when she returned to France and settled in Montady.\nWhen Martha Ackelsberg was doing research for her book on the Mujeres Libres, Free Women of Spain, she was introduced to Torelles by Sara Berenguer. The interview took place at her house in Montady, on 28 April 1988. Torrelles spent hours discussing her experiences with Ackelsberg, becoming a key primary source for the book.\nTeresa Torrelles died on 18 May 1991, in the hosptial at Béziers. Her daughter Marisol herself died from COVID-19 on 29 March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. The historian Teresa Rodríguez Herrerías has published a biography about Torrelles, titled Teresa Torrelles Espina, una lluitadora per la revolució social (English: Teresa Torrelles Espina, a fighter for the social revolution).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Teresa Torrelles Espina (1908-1991)\".

        "content": "Josephine Hemenway Kenyon (May 10, 1880-January 10, 1965) was an American pediatrician and health educator who is known for her contributions to the field of childcare and public health education in the early 20th century. She was among the earliest women to graduate from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and went on to have a distinguished career as a physician, researcher, and prominent advocate for scientific motherhood. \nKenyon practiced medicine throughout her career, maintaining affiliations with several hospitals in New York, including the Neurological Institute, the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, and Bellevue Hospital. She was a member of several professional medical societies, including the American Medical Association, and a fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nJosephine Hemenway Kenyon was born on May 10, 1880, in Auburn, New York. She was the daughter of Charles Carroll Hemenway, a Presbyterian minister, and Ida Eliza Shackelford. When Kenyon was eleven years old, the family moved to Glasgow, Missouri, where her father became the president of Pritchett College. Kenyon studied at Pritchett, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1898 and a master's degree in 1899.\nIn 1899, Kenyon moved to Philadelphia and studied biology under Thomas Hunt Morgan at Bryn Mawr College work towards a career in medicine. In 1900, she became a student at the School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where she received education under physicians who included William Henry Welch, Sir William Osler, William Stewart Halsted, and Howard Atwood Kelly. In 1904, Kenyon was one of three women who graduated in a class of forty-five people, some of the earliest women who graduated from the medical school.\n\n\n=== Medical career ===\nUpon graduating, Kenyon won a competitive internship as a medical officer at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital, which she held for a year. In 1905, she began the first of six years as a resident at the Babies' Hospital of New York City, one of the first U.S. institutions exclusively dealing with the care of infants below the age of three. During her residency, Kenyon conducted research on influenza and meningitis diseases of children with the hospital's chief physician, Luther Emmett Holt, considered a founding father of pediatrics in the United States, and Martha Wollstein, another resident who later became a notable medical researcher at the Rockefeller Institute.\nFollowing her residency, Kenyon opened her own private practice in pediatrics in New York City. In 1911, she married James Henry Kenyon, a neurosurgeon at Babies' Hospital. The couple had two daughters.\n\n\n=== Educator and public health advocate ===\nKenyon also began to work as an educator on topics relating to childcare, social hygiene, and sex education. By 1909, she was giving special lectures at Teachers College, Columbia University, and in 1913 she was appointed there to the position of lecturer, which she held for twenty-four years. Kenyon initiated a course in childcare, on the recommendation of Holt, who described her as \"the best man I ever had on my staff.\" She also lectured on topics relating to health education and social hygiene, which were intended to deter prostitution and the transmission of venereal disease.\nKenyon assisted social reform organizations concerned with public health work, including the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Board of National Missions, the New York Diet Kitchen, and the national board of the Young Women's Christian Associations (YWCA). In her work for the YWCA, she organized a nationwide lecture series, with presentations from women physicians, to address audiences of young women. During World War I, she organized a series of lectures to address the proper sexual conduct of women dealing with soldiers. She served as the acting director of the Women's Work Section of the Social Hygiene Division for the Commission on Training Camp Activities of the U.S. War Department.\nIn 1921 Kenyon's work with the YWCA board ended. In 1922 she took on a new role in public health education. She accepted a position with Good Housekeeping that situated her as a popular scientific authority. Kenyon directed the Health and Happiness Club, a correspondence service for expectant mothers that sent them letters on prenatal and later infant care. By 1923, Kenyon was writing monthly columns for the magazine, focusing on problems of infant care brought up by the club's members.\n\n\n=== Author and pediatric advisor ===\nIn 1934, Kenyon wrote Healthy Babies Are Happy Babies: A Complete Handbook for Modern Mothers. The book belonged to a genre of childcare manuals pioneered by Holt had pioneered in 1894 with The Care and Feeding of Children. Kenyon's book was very popular, undergoing nineteen printings in the United States and five translations abroad. The book's popularity reflected Kenyon's appeal and perceived authority as both a mother and a physician. Over the course of its five revisions (the final two co-authored with her daughter Ruth Kenyon Russell) her advice moved from emphasizing rigid schedules to encouraging \"on-demand\" scheduling based on the child. The child's healthy emotional development was emphasized, as was the importance of the pre- and postnatal health of the mother.\nThe book was widely praised for its practical advice and appeal to both mothers and physicians. Hazel Corbin, general director of the Maternity Center Association, enthusiastically endorsed the book, telling new mothers that \"the soundest advice I can give you on baby care is to get a copy of that book.\"\n\n\n== Later life and legacy ==\nKenyon's mother, Ida Shackelford moved in with her in 1933. Kenyon's husband died in 1939. Her mother died on October 14, 1940, after a long-term illness. In 1950, Kenyon closed her pediatric practice and moved to Boulder, Colorado, to live near her daughters and their families. She continued writing for Good Housekeeping until 1952. Kenyon died in Boulder on January 10, 1965, at the age of 84.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOpitz, Donald L. \"Kenyon, Josephine Hemenway (1880-1965), pediatrician and health educator.\" American National Biography.

        "content": "The Hinkly House Museum is a restored Victorian mansion located in Luverne, Rock County, Minnesota owned and operated by the Rock County Historical Society. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1892 by (Ray Benjamin) R.B. Hinkly, a prominent local businessman and one of Luverne's founders, the house is executed with Queen Anne design features. The house is constructed from Sioux Quartzite mined from Hinkly's own quarry (now part of Blue Mounds State Park). At the time it was built, it was thought to be the \"most handsome house\" in all of southern Minnesota.\nDonated to the Rock County Historical Society in 1959, the Hinkly House Museum features twelve rooms, two bathrooms, and a spacious attic, all restored to reflect turn-of-the-century. Visitors can tour the house and period furnishings, wallpapers recreated to match the originals, and ceilings that echo the designs of the era.\nA unique feature of the Hinkly House is the basement tunnel connecting to a hidden dynamite storage room in the backyard, a reminder of Hinkly's involvement in quarrying. The careful restoration throughout the house offers a glimpse into the lives of a wealthy family in late 19th-century Minnesota.\n\n\n=== R.B. Hinkly ===\nHinkly's career spanned law, media, and finance. Before banking, he practiced law and edited a newspaper in Claremont, Iowa. He then played a key role in establishing financial institutions across Minnesota and South Dakota.  He founded the Luverne Brick and Tile Company, Luverne's largest industry. In addition, he owned several thousand acres of land in Rock County and Texas.  \n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe heirs of the R. B. Hinkly family presented the house to the Rock County Historical Society in 1959.  Today the Rock County Historical Society owns and manages the day-to-day operations of house museum. The museum is open for public tours seasonally from June to August and also anytime by appointment. The house also occasionally hosts exhibits such as a replica of President Abraham Lincoln's coffin in the house's parlor room.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Rock County, Minnesota\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "Mark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman is a 1977 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nMark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman is the 15th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 45 years old and released by the Audiophile Records label in the United States in 1978 on LP and 1998 on CD. This album is a release of songs and commentary from two episodes of the radio show American Popular Song with Alec Wilder and Friends.\n\n\n== Background ==\nComposer Alec Wilder wrote American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950. Published in 1972, it soon came to be considered a seminal reference on The Great American Songbook. Producer Dick Phipps subsequently developed the idea of a radio show with famous guest singers performing and discussing selected songs with Wilder and pianist Loonis McGlohon for the South Carolina Educational Radio Network. NPR aired the radio show American Popular Song with Alec Wilder and Friends, based on Wilder's book, from 1976 through 1978. The series of 38 one-hour radio programs featured guest singers Mabel Mercer, Bobby Short, Tony Bennett, Johnny Hartman, Mildred Bailey, Thelma Carpenter, Irene Kral, Jackie Cain, Teddi King, David Allyn, Barbara Lea, Marlene VerPlanck, Dick Haymes, Margaret Whiting, and others singing and discussing American popular song with pianist Loonis McGlohon and Wilder, who provided expert commentary. It won a 1976 Peabody Award for the South Carolina Educational Radio Network. Wilder had become a big Murphy supporter and had Murphy on his radio show. They recorded material for two shows in September 1977 and first broadcast in February 1978, featuring songs by Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields. The recordings were released on LP in 1978 as Mark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman (Audiophile). The CD reissue contained previously unreleased tracks. \nIn the original liner notes, Wilder recounts how he had been totally unaware of Murphy until McGlohon played him one of Murphy's recordings. At the time, after taping twenty-seven shows, Wilder found the program to be a burden and he wanted to stop his radio series. But hearing Murphy inspired him to continue. Shortly thereafter he decided to have Murphy as a guest on his show. Wilder said to McGlohon, \"We have to get him before the public. We'll do another radio show\". Wilder then agreed to do another 13 shows starting with Murphy singing Cy Coleman songs. Wilder wrote, \"| was quite literally amazed. Mark’s musicianship, range, intonation, diction, inventiveness, and incredible rhythmic sense are all of a piece and all marvelous...| honestly consider him one of the very few great singers | have ever heard...Mark Murphy exemplifies professionalism, quality, distinction, and style\". \"Thenceforth,\" according to Fred Bouchard in the liner notes to Murphy's Satisfaction Guaranteed, \"Wilder raved about Murphy as one of the greatest interpreters of ballads and standards (so reports WBUR-FM host and Murphy enthusiast Tony Cennamo)\". And Murphy said of Wilder, \"I run into people every few years, thank God, that are just instant friends, and it was like that with Alec. So many people don't relax me, but with him the talk flowed so freely, and | was just able to be myself\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\nIn order to convince Wilder to commit to the show and keep him at ease, the recordings were made in producer Dick Phipps' living room in Lake Murray, Lexington, South Carolina. Dick Phipps produced many additional Audiophile Records releases from the American Popular Song with Alec Wilder and Friends radio show as well as The Jazz Alliance label releases from Marian McPartland's NPR radio show Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz. \nPianist Loonis McGlohon was an accompanist to many singers including Johnny Hartman, Eileen Farrell, Mabel Mercer and Judy Garland and he wrote songs with Wilder including \"Blackberry Winter\" and \"Be a Child\", and on this release \"Walking Sad\", and \"When Yesterday I Loved You\". On this release McGlohon functions as music director, arranger and pianist with Terry Lassiter on bass, and Jim Lackey on drums.\n\nThe Coleman selections include songs from Coleman's musicals Seesaw, Spanglish, and Sweet Charity, as well as other songs he wrote in the 50s, 60s and 70s. The Fields' selections include songs she wrote with Coleman, Jerome Kern, Jimmy McHugh, and Arthur Schwartz, spanning her long career from the 30s-70s. In addition, Murphy sings two Alec Wilder and Loonis McGlohon songs and \"Doodlin\" from Murphy's own album Rah.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAndy Rowan assigns this album 4 stars in The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide. (4 stars means, \"Excellent: Four-star albums represent peak performances in an artist's career. Generally speaking, albums that are granted four or more stars constitute the best introductions to an artist's work for listeners who are curious\").\nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings assigns the album 3 stars. (3 stars means,\" A good, middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which will reward the listener tuned to its merits\").\nPeter Reilly writing in Stereo Review in 1979, singles out \"I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life\", \"I Walk a Little Faster\" as two Coleman \"gems\" and says Murphy gives \"dapper, worldly readings\" of Fields' \"Don't Blame Me\", \"I'm in the Mood for Love\", and \"A Fine Romance\". He writes, \"Murphy use his voice almost as a musical instrument in the best old-jazz style, yet along with it he maintains an almost uncanny ability to shed new and different light on lyric meanings\". \nScott Yanow includes the album in his list of other worthy recordings by Mark Murphy of the past 20 years in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide. \nMurphy biographer Peter Jones finds this album \"a surprise, and a delightful one...the album reveals Murphy as a peerless straight-ahead interpreter of standards\"...giving \"low-key, warm and intimate\" readings.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Don't Blame Me\" (Jimmy McHugh, Dorothy Fields) – 2:52\nChicago Revue: Clowns in Clover 1933\n\"Witchcraft\" (Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh) – 2:36\nRevue: Julius Monk’s Take Five 1957\n\"A Fine Romance\" (Jerome Kern, Fields) – 2:16\nFilm: Swing Time 1936\n\"April Fooled Me\" (Kern, Fields) – 2:12\n\"Seesaw\" (Coleman, Fields) – 3:04\nMusical: “Seesaw\" 1973\n\"I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life\" (Coleman, Joseph Allen McCarthy) – 3:14\n\"When In Rome\" (Coleman, Leigh) – 2:47\n\"When Yesterday I Loved You\" (Alec Wilder, Loonis McGlohon) – 3:47\n\"Where Am I Going\" (Coleman, Fields) – 2:53\nMusical: Sweet Charity 1966\n\"Walking Sad\" (Wilder, McGlohon) – 3:57\n\"Exactly Like You\" (McHugh, Fields) – 1:57\nRevue: Lew Leslie’s International Review 1930\n\"Alone Too Long\" (Arthur Schwartz, Fields) – 3:20\nMusical: By the Beautiful Sea 1954\n\"On Second Thought\" (Coleman, Leigh) – 2:51\n\"I Walk a Little Faster\" (Coleman, Leigh) – 2:12\n\"Rules of the Road\"(Coleman, Leigh) – 3:21\n\"That's My Style\" (Coleman, Peggy Lee) – 3:16\n\"I'm in the Mood for Love\" (McHugh, Fields) – 3:17\nFilm: Every Night at Eight 1935\n\"The Best is Yet To Come\" (Coleman, Leigh) – 2:15\n\"Real Live Girl\" (Coleman, Leigh) – 1:60\nCommentary by Mark Murphy, Wilder and McGlohon\n\"Remind Me\" (Kern, Fields) – 3:42\nFilm: One Night in the Tropics 1940\n\"I Love My Wife\" (Coleman, Michael Stewart) – 3:34\nMusical: | Love My Wife 1977\n\"Sometime When You're Lonely\" (Coleman) – 2:57\nMusical: Spanglish 1965\n\"Doodlin' \" (Horace Silver, Jon Hendricks) – 3:58\n\"I'm Way Ahead\" (Coleman, Fields) – 4:14\nMusical: Seesaw 1973\n\"Lovely To Look At\" (Kern, Fields,  McHugh) – 1:34\nFilm: Roberta 1935\nCommentary by Wilder\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals\nTerry Lassiter – bass\nJim Lackey – drums\nLoonis McGlohon – piano, arranger\n\nProduction\nWilliam D, Hay – mastering, engineer,\nDick Phipps – producer\nParker Dinkins – digital transfers, premastering\nWendell Echols – production coordinator\nReg Stagmaier – art direction, cover design\nAlec Wilder – liner notes, 1978\nJames Gavin – liner notes, 1998\nGeorge H Buck, Jr. – liner notes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman at MusicBrainz (release group)\nMark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman at Discogs (master release)\nMark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman at AllMusic (release)\nMark Murphy Sings Mostly Dorothy Fields & Cy Coleman at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Penguin Guide to Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide at Internet Archive",

        "content": "Kathleen Okubo (March 25, 1953 – April 7, 2024) was a Filipino journalist, columnist, dissident and writer based in Baguio.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKathleen Okubo was born to Bernardo Okubo on March 25, 1953. She was a nephew of Yoshinai \"Sinai\" Hamada, who founded the Baguio Midland Courier, where she first worked as a journalist in 1964.\n\n\n== Journalism ==\nDuring the martial law era, Okubo was arrested in Pangasinan in 1973 for organizing youth and students while contributing stories for local newspapers under a pseudonym. She was later released but was required to report regularly to Philippine Constabulary headquarters in Camp Bado Dangwa in La Trinidad, Benguet. Despite this, she maintained her career as a journalist, eventually helping to establish several other news outlets covering northern Luzon such as the Cordillera News Agency and Cordillera News and Features (CNF).\nAfter the end of martial law, Okubo faced threats from authorities and the Cordillera People's Liberation Army who accused her of subversion and supporting the CPP-NPA for her reporting on human rights violations and other abuses in the Cordillera Administrative Region, which led to her being imprisoned twice during the 1990s. Despite this, she continued to report critically on such matters and advocated for press freedom by helping to establish a joint chapter of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines in Baguio-Benguet as well as in Ilocos Sur.\nIn 1989, Okubo founded Northern Dispatch as a mimeographed dispatch, which she eventually led to become a full-pledged community paper in 2002. She later served as its editor-in-chief until her retirement in 2019, but continued to work for the paper as a contributor and editorial consultant until 2022.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOkubo died after suffering several illnesses on April 7, 2024, at the age of 71. Her remains were cremated on April 12.\n\n\n== Selected awards ==\nDistinguished Gintong Tala Luminary Award in Journalism by the National Correspondents Club of Baguio (2018)\n\n\n== See also ==\n Philippines portal\n Journalism portal\n\n\n== References ==",

The book is also known as Kitab al-Tijan li ma'rifati muluk al-zamān fi akhbar Qahtān (The Book of Crowns, on the kings of yesteryear in the accounts of the Qahtānites). \nThe book later transmitted by Ibn Hisham who also worked on the As-Sīrah an-Nabawiyyah. Ibn Hisham reported that he acquired the book narrative from 'Abd al-mun'im idris. \n\n\n== Content ==\nThe book focusing on biographies and the ancestry of the rulers of the Himyarite Kingdom.  \nAnother content of this book were musing about the genealogy of the descendants of Ham, son of Biblical Noah, which the book describe as progenitor of Habesha peoples or Ethiopian peoples. In this topic, Wahb told the stories about how the southern Arabian king Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan has fought against the presence of Habesha peoples in Arabian peninsula on 6th century AD. \nThe content of the book also covering the identification of Dhu al-Qarnayn, where Wahb identifying the legendary conqueror belongs to ancient Roman people ethnicity. However, Ibn Hisham gave his own personal commentary contradicting Wahb, Dhu al-Qarnayn was one of the Tubba(ruler title of Saba and Himyar kingdoms), with the name of as-Sa'ab, son of al-Harith. In this book narration, Dhu al-Qarnayn were campaigning as far as Andalusia region or classical era Spain. \n\n\n=== Commentaries ===\nIbn Hisham, who authored the commentaries of this book, also gave his own analysis that the Yemen region name were given from their primordial founder, Ya'rub(son of Qahtan), who also known by his other name, \"Yaman\". This book also become supplementary for another works of Ibn Hisham for history of Yemen region, Ubayd Ibn Sharya al-DjurhumƯ al-Yaman.\nModern historian Jan Retsö has suggested that the commentaries of Ibn Hisham has shown there is interest from Muslim orthodoxy in his era to preserve the historiography of Yemeni tradition.\nModern historians has said that some entries and stories in the book, are, however, legendary in nature and may not reflect reality. \n\n\n=== List of kings mentioned in the book ===\nThe book structures mainly examines the descendants of South Arabian patriarch Qahtan. Below is a list of kings mentioned in the book, in order:\n\nMalik al-Himyar, the son of Sheba\nWa'il ibn Himyar\nSaksak ibn Wa'il\nYa'fur ibn Saksak\n'Amir Dhu Ra'ysh\nAl-Ma'afir ibn Ya'fur\nShaddad ibn Aad\nLuqman ibn Aad\nDhu Shaddad al-Himaal ibn Aad\nAl-Harith ibn al-Himaal\nDhul Qarnayn\nAbraha (not Abraha al-Ashram)\n'Abd ibn Abraha\n'Amr ibn Abraha\nShurahil\nAl-Hedhed ibn Shurahil\nQueen of Sheba\nRehoboam\nMalik ibn 'Amr ibn Ya'fur\nShammar Yahri'sh\nSafi' ibn Shammar, the king of the Nabataeans\n'Amr ibn 'Amr Mazikiyah\nThe first king of the Ghassanids\nRabia ibn Nasr\nAbu Karib\nHassan Yuha'min\nSharhabil Yafar (known here as 'Amr ibn Tubba' al-As'ad)\n'Abd-Kulal\nSharhabil Yakkuf (known here as Tubba' ibn al-Hassan)\nRabia ibn Marthad\nHassan ibn 'Amr ibn Tubba' al-As'ad\nAbraha, son of Al-Sabbah (not Abraha al-Ashram)\nDhu Shanatir\nDhu Nuwas\nAbraha\nYaksum ibn Abraha\nSayf ibn Dhi Yazan\n\n\n== See also ==\nBook of the Himyarites, a Syriac Christian biographical work about the Himyarite Kingdom and its adoption of Judaism\nTarikh al-Tabari\nAl-Bidayah wan Nihayah\nSiyar A'lam al-Nubala\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Optometry is an album by the American musician DJ Spooky, released in 2002. It was part of Thirsty Ear Recordings' Blue Series of albums. DJ Spooky considered it an example of Gesamtkunstwerk. He supported the album with a North American tour. A remix album, Dubtrometry, was released in 2003.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe tracks began as free form improvisations played by musicians recruited by DJ Spooky, who then altered, edited, and applied samples to the songs; he also played bass and kalimba. Matthew Shipp played piano on the album; Pauline Oliveros contributed on accordion. William Parker played bass and Guillermo E. Brown served as the project's drummer. Joe McPhee contributed on trumpet and saxophone. \"Asphalt (Tome II)\" contains a spoken word contribution from Carl Hancock Rux.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nPitchfork wrote: \"Rather than just make an album that merges a few different techniques or genres, Spooky has made a point of calling attention to it... Ultimately, Spooky casts himself as ringleader to a revolution that fails to happen—after the initial bustle of a few extremely strong tracks, Optometry wanders blindly for far too long.\" The Gazette noted that the album melds \"music and social theory with collage-like cross-referencing.\" The Los Angeles Times concluded that \"DJ culture does have its Zappa, its Stockhausen, its Cage, an artist defying fashion and changing the possibilities of music forever... Without vinyl pyrotechnics, Spooky reveals how free jazz is also the highest expression of outlaw classical composition.\"\nThe Boston Globe determined that, \"there may be programmed beats, samples, synthesizers, and even a bit of rapping on this disc, but it's free jazz at heart, it grooves throughout—and it just may be the Bitches Brew of its era.\" The Independent said that \"Optometry hangs around menacingly towards the 'free' end of the jazz spectrum, the intellectual end of the hip-hop one, but that doesn't mean it's an ugly bastard.\" Rolling Stone deemed Optometry \"a fusion exercise that's at turns pensive and frenetic but always richly textured.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Optometry is fully a DJ outing and fully a jazz record.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He would spend five seasons at Berwick from 1985 to 1989 and was joined at the club in 1988 by his brother Mark Courtney. Together they would help the Bandits win the Knockout Cup in 1989, defeating Poole Pirates in the final. \nAt the start of the 1990 National League season Courtney signed for Glasgow Tigers, where he rode for the Scottish club for two seasons before competing for Rye House Rockets in 1992 and his former club Edinburgh in 1993. \nIt was the decision to re-sign for Glasgow for the 1994 season that wrote his name in the Glasgow Tigers history because he was part of the team that achieved the 'double double' (the league and cup double for two consecutive seasons) in 1994.\nAfter a season with Belle Vue Aces in the 1996 top division, he returned once again to Glasgow, where he saw out his career from 1997 until 2000. During his last season (2000) his brother Mark and nephew Scott Courtney both rode in the same team Glasgow team.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHis brother Mark Courtney and nephews Jamie Courtney and Scott Courtney were all professional speedway riders.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Wesenberg Castle (in German: Burg Wesenberg, in Estonian: Rakvere ordulinnus) is a ruined castle located next to Rakvere in the north of Estonia.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn Estonian fort named Tarnvape originally stood on this moraine hill. The Danes settled in this coastal region in 1219 and seized part of Livonia, while the Sword Brethren also Christianized the area. Their order merged with the Teutonic Knights in 1237.\nThe Danes built an initial stone castle in the mid-21th century that took the form of a quadrangular medieval castle, surrounded by wooden palisades. It is first mentioned in writing under the name Rakovor in Russian chronicles.\nThe Kingdom of Denmark eventually sold its Livonian possessions to the Teutonic Order in 1346. The knights rebuilt the castle, which took the name Wesenberg and became the seat of a Vogt (bailiff, in German) of the Order, a sort of regional manager. The foundations were reinforced, two corner towers were built on the south side, as well as the Vorburg, or defensive building at the entrance of the castle. The knights also erected the round tower that can still be admired today at the beginning of the 21th century.\n\nThe Russians captured the castle, which had been secularized for a few decades (the Teutonic Order having dissolved in the region in 1525, when Duke Albert of Brandenburg converted to the Lutheran religion), during the Livonian Wars of 1558-1581, and surrounded it with a high rampart. The castle lost its purpose in the 21th century, after being ravaged by the Poles in 1605, and gradually fell into disrepair, its last owner having turned it into a stone quarry in the 21th century.\nThe region was part of the Russian Empire from the early 21th century to 1917, of the Estonian republic from 1919 to 1939, of the USSR from 1939 to 1941, then it was occupied by the Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1944 and was again part of the USSR from 1944 to 1991. It is now in Estonia. Today, it is one of the country's most visited tourist monuments.\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

        "content": "Francis Olubowale Aderibigbe Oke (born 8 September 1956) is a Nigerian author, Christian leader and televangelist. He is the founder and presiding Bishop of Sword of the Spirit Ministries. He also serves as the current President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria and Chancellor of Precious Cornerstone University (PCU) in Ibadan.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOke was born in Kasumu village, Egbeda local government area of Oyo State, Nigeria, on 8 September 1956. Spending his formative years in Kasumu, he later relocated to Ibadan at the age of 11. In Ibadan, he attended Wesley Teachers' College before furthering his education at a polytechnic. Subsequently, he gained admission to the University of Lagos, where he pursued studies in Land and Engineering Survey.\nDuring his time at the university, he felt called to the ministry and became associated with influential figures in Nigerian Christianity, such as E. A. Adeboye, Kumuyi, Benson Idahosa, and David Oyedepo. Notably, Adeboye lectured Oke in Mathematics in 1977.\n\n\n== Ministry ==\nOke responded to his calling in December 1975 and established Sword of the Spirit Ministries in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria, following his university education. He transitioned to full-time ministry on 17 May 1982.\nIn May 1990, Oke founded the International Bible College of Ministries (IBCOMS) to provide training for ministry. Additionally, after a period of itinerant ministry across Nigeria, he founded Christ Life Church in February 1989 – a church arm of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries.\nOke hosts \"The Voice of the Lord\", a daily broadcast on Nigeria national radio and television stations FRCN and NTA, Ibadan, and leads a prayer and intercession programme in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Nigeria, known as The Nigeria Turning Point.\nAcknowledged for his contributions to world evangelism, Oke received an honorary doctorate from All Nations for Christ Bible Institute in November 1991, under the auspices of Oral Roberts University. He was also honoured with the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria's (FRCN) award for contributions to religious harmony and human development.\nIn 1999, Oke was consecrated as a Bishop. The Annual Holy Ghost Convention, which he hosts, has served as a platform for spiritual renewal. Under him, Sword of the Spirit Ministries expanded its reach within Nigeria and to other countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States.\nOke also serves as the Chancellor of Precious Cornerstone University (PCU) in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria since 11 November 2022. On 3 March 2021, he was appointed the President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, after previously serving as its Deputy President.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrancis Wale Oke is married to Victoria Tokunbo Oke. After proposing to her on 19 May 1982, the couple got married on 17 December 1983. Together, they had two children. Their daughter, Dorcas, died in 2001 due to complications related to adulterated drugs. In response to this loss, they established the Dorcas Oke Hope Alive Initiative (DOHAL), a humanitarian organisation dedicated to addressing health, humanitarian, and poverty-related issues affecting African youth and children, in memory of their daughter.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEnoch Adeboye\nStephen Akinola\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSOTSM Official Website",

        "content": "The Strategion (Greek: τὸ Στρατήγιον) was a public square and market located in Constantinople, now vanished, important for historical reasons. The square was the equivalent of Campus Martius for Rome, while the market was one of the most important of the city.\n\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nThe name possibly comes from the military exercises which took place there, akin to those in Rome's Campus Martius, or from the victorious generals (Greek: στρατηγός, pl. στρατηγοί, pr. strategos) who received military honors in this place.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe square was located in the fifth region of Constantinople, in the valley separating the first hill from the second. Based on an account by Pierre Gilles, a French traveler of the 16th century, who claimed to have seen a granite Theban obelisk near the glassmakers' house that stood at the north end of the Topkapı Palace, the Strategion was thought to be located on the north side of sultan's palace. More recent research, based on the surveying of the region by Ernest Mamboury, has set its location at the bottom of the north slope of the first hill of the city, near the Neorion and Prosphorion Harbours along the Golden Horn.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Strategion possibly predated the foundation of Constantinople in 330, and had an Hellenistic origin.\nAccording to one tradition, the square was created by Alexander the Great, and was restored by Septimius Severus after the destruction of Byzantium.\nThe square was possibly included inside the walled city of Byzantion, and was the first agora of the city. People coming from the sea met the Strategion as soon as they entered the city walls, after crossing the gate of Eugenius (Turkish: Yalıköşkü kapısı). The Strategion could also be accessed from land, after crossing the gate of Urbicius.\nOriginally conceived as a military parade ground, it was turned into a public square by Constantine, and renewed by Theodosius I, who possibly transformed its representative part into a forum and gained a market in a smaller section.\nOver time, the importance of the Strategion as a representative center diminished, and in the eleventh century the square had became only a large market place.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Strategion was divided in two zones, with different functions: a larger one (\"mega strategion\"), devoted to representative duties, and a smaller one (\"mikron strategion\"), commercial.  The structure was adjacent to two small harbors lying along the south shore of the Golden Horn: the Neorion, which connected the city with the suburb of Sykae, on the northern shore of the gulf, and the Prosphorion, which was the terminal of the sea traffic with Chalcedon, on the Asian shore.\nAbout its layout not much is known, but it was possibly rectangular, like those of other Hellenistic foundations, like Miletus, Priene and Palmyra.\nIts original military function is confirmed by several military monuments in its premises: a statue of Constantine, another of Emperor Leo I erected in the mikron strategion, a bronze tripod and a statue of the Fortuna goddess bearing a cornucopia over an arch. Near the statue of Constantine lay a stone obelisk bearing an inscription where the Emperor proclames the city as the new Rome. According to a tradition, a statue of Alexander the Great, originally erected by his soldiers in Chrysopolis to thank him for having received double salary, stood on the square after being moved there by Constantine. \nA sculpture group called pelargos (Greek: Πελαργός, \"stork\" in Greek), representing three storks facing each other, and carved by Apollonius of Tyana, was erected at the Strategion. The group was displayed there to ward off the storks, because the birds used to drop the remains of caught snakes in the nearby water cisterns, polluting the water.\nThe forum had also a representational function: when the emperor landed at one of the two harbors, and wanted to climb the hill to go to the Hagia Sophia and the great Palace, entering the city through one of the two gates cited above, the senators with the Eparch greeted him at the Strategion, offering him crowns. The forum was also the arrival point of imperial processions: in fact the Emperor, standing on top of a chariot and accompanied by a mounted escort, descended regularly from its palace to the Strategion to inspect the grain depots. During one of these processions, Emperor Theodosius II was attacked with stones by a hungry mob because of lack of bread.\nThe most important function of the Strategion was the commercial one: along the square lay four warehouses: the horrea olearia and the horrea troadensia, valentiaca and costantiaca, respectively oil (the first) and wheat (the latter three) depots, whose content fed the population of the city.  In the square converged several arcaded roads (Greek: Ἔμβολος, pl. Ἔμβολοι pr. embolos) devoted to commerce.\nMoreover, the square hosted two markets (Latin: macellum, pl. macella), devoted to meat and fish: butchers came there to buy livestock branded for sale by the Praefectus urbi, and until the beginning of Lent merchants of sheep were allowed to sell there their animals, while from Easter until Ascension lambs were sold at the Forum Tauri.\nAlong or near the Strategion lay the churches of the Theotokos, built by the strategos Urbicius, Aghios Epiphanios, Aghios Philemon, which contained chapels dedicated to Aghios Anastasion of Persia and Aghios Sabas,  a martyrion dedicated to Aghios Photios and Aniketos, and Aghios Andreas. Also one of the most important baths of the city, the Baths of Achilles, lay in its immediate vicinity.\nNear the Strategion lay also the city's first prison, predating Constantine's reign and abandoned because of its filthy conditions by Phocas.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJanin, Raymond (1950).

        "content": "Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (He That Is Without Sin?) (Russian: «Христо́с и гре́шница» («Кто без греха́?»)) is a large-format painting by the Russian artist Vasily Polenov (1844–1927), dated 1888. The painting is in the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg (Inventory Zh-4204). Measuring 325 × 611 cm, it depicts the story of Christ and the woman taken in adultery, described in the Gospel of John.\nThe painting was conceived by the artist in the late 1860s, with the first sketches appearing in the early 1870s. Some fifteen years passed before the final version of the canvas was completed. While working on the painting, Polenov travelled to the Middle East (1881–1882) and Italy (1883–1884).\nThe canvas was presented at the 15th Exhibition of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions (Peredvizhniki), which opened in Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1887. At the exhibition, the painting was purchased by Tsar Alexander III. The painting was then kept in the Winter Palace, and when the Russian Museum was founded, it became part of its collection in 1897.\nOn the one hand, the painting is seen as an attempt at a realistic interpretation of the image of Christ and the Gospel story. On the other hand, art historians have also identified the influence of late academicism on the painting, noting that among the attempts to revive large-format academic historical painting, \"Polenov's painting is the most significant and serious\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Conception and work on the painting ===\nThe concept for the future canvas, entitled Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, was first conceived in 1868, influenced by Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov's painting The Appearance of Christ Before the People. Polenov set himself the task of creating \"Christ not only coming, but already in the world, making his way among the people\". The book The Life of Jesus by the French philosopher and writer Ernest Renan, which emphasised the human nature of Christ, had a significant influence on the interpretation of the subject. By the time work on the painting began, Russian painting had already produced such famous canvases on Gospel themes as the Last Supper by Nikolai Ge and Christ in the Desert by Ivan Kramskoi.\n\nThe initial sketches and studies for the painting were created in the 1870s. Of these, two are particularly noteworthy – the 1873 sketch, which aligns with the original concept of the painting, and the 1876 sketch, which is closer to the final composition of the canvas. After that, work on the painting came to a standstill, but in 1881, when the artist's sister Vera Dmitrievna Polenova (the twin of Vasily Polenov) was dying, she made her brother promise to resume work on the painting and also asked that the canvas be large. By then, Polenov had become quite successful in the genre of landscape painting, but, fulfilling the promise to his sister, he returned to historical painting.\nIn 1881–1882, Polenov undertook a journey to the Middle East, which was largely associated with the work on Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery. He travelled to Constantinople, Alexandria, Cairo, and Aswan, visited Palestine and Syria, and also stopped by Greece. Polenov's travelling companions were the linguist and archaeologist Semyon Abamelek-Lazarev and the art historian Adrian Prakhov. The trip provided Polenov with a substantial corpus of observations pertaining to the nature and architecture of Palestine, as well as the appearance and customs of its population. The artist subsequently employed these techniques to achieve greater realism in his depictions of the Gospel narrative. However, the outcomes of the journey did not significantly advance Polenov's progress towards the realization of his intended painting of Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, as he devoted minimal time to making sketches and studies during the expedition.\n\nIn the spring of 1883, already a teacher at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, Polenov finally began work on a large painting. However, it became evident that the material collected during his trip to the Middle East was insufficient for the task at hand. While he had landscape sketches and architectural sketches, he lacked sufficient images of people. To address this deficiency, Polenov took a year's leave from his academic position and, accompanied by his wife, Natalia Vasilyevna, departed for Rome at the end of October 1883. Their itinerary included visits to Vienna, Venice, and Florence. Consequently, in the 1883–1884 period, Polenov continued his work on the painting in Rome. He proceeded to refine the sketches and also produced images of Italian Jews. In a letter to his sister Elena Dmitrievna, Natalia Vasilievna described the Roman period of Polenov's activity: \"He works very much, but whether he is successful or not is again terribly difficult to say; it seems to me that he looks for too much and too little in his work, and it is terribly tiring.\" She reported that Polenov drew one or two sketches from nature every day, and said that she \"would be calmer at heart if the sketches were half as many and more in content\". In April 1884, Polenov was visited in Rome by the businessman and patron Savva Mamontov, with whom the artist was well acquainted from the Abramtsevsky Circle. According to Natalia Vasilyevna, \"Savva treated his work very kindly and examined his sketches sincerely and not empty-handedly\", which \"gave Vasily new zeal\".\nIn May 1884, the Polenovs returned to Russia from Italy. In the summer of 1885, the artist worked at the Menshovo estate near Podolsk, where he created a full-length sketch for Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, executed in charcoal on canvas. The final version of the painting was completed by Polenov in 1886–1887 in Savva Mamontov's study within his residence on Sadovaya-Spasskaya Street in Moscow. In addition to his immediate family and Savva Mamontov, Polenov consulted with the artists Konstantin Korovin and Viktor Vasnetsov, as well as the physiologist Pyotr Spiro, during the painting process.\n\n\n=== 15th Travelling Exhibition ===\nIt was anticipated that the painting Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery would be exhibited at the 15th exhibition of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions (Peredvizhniki), which commenced in Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1887. Polenov departed for Saint Petersburg in advance, in mid-February, and his canvas arrived a few days after the artist. Upon its installation in the exhibition hall, it was discovered that another large-format painting on a historical subject, Boyarina Morozova by Vasily Surikov, would be exhibited at the exhibition.\n\nA few days before the exhibition opened, the paintings were examined by the censor Nikitin. Apparently, this was Nikolai Vasilyevich Nikitin, an Active State Councillor, who served as the chief inspector of printers, lithographers and similar establishments in Saint Petersburg. In any case, Nikitin was reluctant to grant permission for Polenov's painting to be included in the exhibition and reported the matter to the Saint Petersburg town governor Pyotr Gresser. The latter dispatched an official with special orders, who permitted the painting to remain until the inspection of the paintings by members of the royal family, including the president of the Academy of Arts, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, and Tsar Alexander III himself.\nShortly afterwards, Vladimir Alexandrovich visited the exhibition. He conducted a meticulous examination of the painting by Polenov (the artist himself was not present at the exhibition at that moment), expressed concern about the inadequate lighting, and concluded that \"for educated people the painting is interesting for its historical character, but for the crowd it is very dangerous and can provoke all sorts of talk\". Nevertheless, the painting remained on display until the Tsar's visit to the exhibition.\n\nOn the morning of the day when Alexander III was expected to arrive, the exhibition was inspected by Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the Ober-Procurator of the Most Holy Synod, who was accompanied by the town governor Pyotr Gresser. Ignoring the other paintings, the pair proceeded directly to Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery. Describing the painting as serious and interesting, Pobedonostsev nevertheless forbade the printing of the exhibition catalogue.  At two o'clock in the afternoon, Vladimir Alexandrovich arrived at the exhibition. Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodorovna arrived twenty minutes later, accompanied by the Grand Dukes George Alexandrovich and Konstantin Konstantinovich. Alexander III expressed his appreciation for the exhibition and proceeded to purchase several paintings. He eventually arrived at Polenov's canvas and spent a considerable amount of time examining it, talking with the artist. In particular, he praised the expression on Christ's face, saying that from a distance \"it seemed a little old, but up close it is really wonderful\".\nAfterwards, Alexander III continued to inspect the exhibition and Polenov remained with his painting. Vladimir Alexandrovich approached him shortly thereafter and inquired as to whether the painting was available for purchase. Polenov responded in the affirmative. Vladimir Alexandrovich then informed the artist that the Tsar wished to purchase the canvas. Indeed, some time later, Alexander III revisited the hall where the painting was exhibited and, having once again ascertained that the painting had not been purchased by anyone, announced that he was retaining it for himself. Upon the announcement that the painting had been acquired by the Tsar, the prevailing sentiment shifted. There was no longer any question of excluding it from the exhibition; moreover, it was relocated to a more adequately illuminated area. Naturally, the exhibition catalogue was printed, in which the painting was duly included.\nPrior to the exhibition, Pavel Tretyakov proposed to Polenov that he sell the painting to him for 20,000 roubles, with the understanding that the Tsar would not purchase it. However, if Alexander III wished to purchase the painting, the price could be increased to 24,000 roubles. Alexander III ultimately paid 30,000 roubles for the painting, which was higher than Tretyakov's proposed price. Nevertheless, this was not the sole factor influencing the sale. The fact that the painting was purchased by the Tsar effectively legalized it, thereby enabling it to be exhibited at the exhibition and later in a museum. Had it been prohibited by the censors – a possibility that might have arisen had Tretyakov retained ownership – it would have been impossible to exhibit it in his gallery.\n\n\n=== After creation ===\nFollowing the exhibition in Saint Petersburg, Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery was also exhibited in Moscow, with the consent of Alexander III. Prior to the Moscow exhibition, Polenov finalized some details and changed the date of the painting's creation to 1888.\nMany years after the painting's creation, in July 1925, in a letter to Vsevolod Voinov, Polenov wrote: \"The painting was titled by me 'Who among you is without sin'. That was its meaning. But the censor did not allow these words to be included in the catalogue, but allowed 'Christ and the woman caught in adultery', because that was the name of other paintings, and then in the museum it was called 'The Prodigal Woman', which was completely contrary to the Gospel story, which clearly says that it is a woman who has sinned. Later, my painting could have been called 'Who among you is without sin', because that is the main idea of the painting.\"\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of the painting were used to purchase a plot of land on the upper Oka River. This land was subsequently developed into a large house, which was designed by Polenov himself. This house is now the State Memorial Historical-Art and Natural Museum-Reserve of V. D. Polenov. The painting itself was originally located in the Winter Palace, but following the establishment of the Russian Museum in 1897, it was transferred to the its collection.\nDuring the Second World War, a number of paintings from the collections of the State Russian Museum were relocated to Molotov (Perm). For paintings of a considerable size, such as Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, wooden shafts of up to 10 metres in length were constructed, on which the paintings were wound. The restoration artists were meticulous in their approach, ensuring that the paint layer was not wrinkled, as this could potentially cause damage. The large paintings, including Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, were returned to the Russian Museum in April 1946. The full-size sketch for the painting, which was located at the Polenovo estate, was evacuated to Tula in 1941, along with the remainder of the museum's collection. It was returned in 1942.\nThe painting is currently on display at the State Russian Museum in Hall 32 of the Mikhailovsky Palace, alongside other works by Polenov.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe subject of the painting the story of Christ and the woman taken in adultery described in the Gospel of John. (The other three Gospels do not contain this story.) The Pharisees and Sadducees brought to Christ a woman found guilty of adultery. According to the laws of Moses, she was to be stoned, which was contrary to the preaching of humanity that Christ professed. As a result, Christ was faced with the dilemma of either breaking the laws of Moses or acting contrary to his own preaching. This episode is described in the eighth chapter of the Gospel of John:Then each of them went home,8:1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.2 Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them.3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them,4 they said to him, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\"6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\"8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"11 She said, \"No one, sir.\" And Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.\"The scene is set in Herod's side chapel of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, with its wide staircase descending in steps. On the left, the slanting rays of the setting sun illuminate the stone walls of the Temple. On the steps we can see the figures of people walking and beggars sitting on the ledges in indifferent poses. On the one hand, Polenov deliberately selected the location of the scene to be the outer courtyard of the Jerusalem Temple for reasons of historical accuracy. This was because the inner courtyard, also known as the \"Court of Israel\", was forbidden to pagans and foreigners on pain of death, so the motley crowd could only lead the sinner to one of the outer courtyards adjoining the temple walls. Conversely, by situating the action outside the temple, Polenov got the opportunity to portray the surrounding landscape. He used sketches and impressions from his trip to the Middle East, believing that \"if [nature] has changed, it has changed very little ... the sky, the mountains, the lake, the rocks, the paths, the stones, the trees, the flowers, it has all remained about the same.\" At the same time, the artist has acknowledged that he deviated from the \"photographic accuracy\" of the landscape in one detail. In the upper right-hand corner of the painting, the slope of the Mount of Olives is depicted, which could not be seen from the south-eastern corner of the portico of the Jerusalem temple. In fact, this mountain is located just behind the viewer. The deliberate introduction of this inaccuracy could be justified by the symbolic significance and importance of the Mount of Olives in the context of that period of Jesus's life.\nThe left half of the painting depicts a scene of tranquility, with Christ seated amidst his disciples and other listeners. It is evident that he was engaged in discourse with them, which was abruptly interrupted by the appearance of a group of people with the sinful woman. This crowd is shown on the right side of the canvas, balancing Christ's entourage in a compositional sense. The painting depicts the culmination of the Gospel narrative: a challenging question of what to do with the adulteress has just been posed; the crowd is momentarily still, awaiting Christ's response; his disciples are similarly awaiting his reaction. According to the art historian Tamara Yurova, \"the canvas is filled with the image of very lively and specific people, but they are all captured in a brief moment and therefore seem suddenly frozen in their reaction to what is happening, in their expression\", and the characters depicted by Polenov \"are more different from each other in their outward appearance than in their inner feelings\".\nIn the composition of the painting, the most expressive image is that of Christ, who represents \"a higher stage of human consciousness, the triumph of reason and humanity\". His white chiton, which shades the pallor of his sad and tired face, is well associated with the inner nature of Christ. In general, the image created by Polenov evokes a sense of fatigue and immersion in melancholy contemplation. One can discern a certain softness, a noble posture, a \"freedom of gesture and pose\", as well as a complex mental life, which collectively distinguish Christ from his disciples, who appear more constrained in their thoughts, feelings, and movements. The artist sought to emphasise the human nature of Christ, attempting to portray his appearance in a manner similar to that of the ordinary people around him. In the words of the writer Vladimir Korolenko, Christ is \"a man – indeed, a man – strong, muscular, with a strong tan of a travelling oriental preacher\".\n\nIn the majority of the sketches and studies created for the painting, Christ is depicted wearing a white cap. This was also the case in the early versions of the main canvas, but a few days before the first public showing of the painting, Polenov removed the cap, persuaded by his mother, Maria Alekseevna. Some critics perceived the non-canonicity of the image of Christ in the absence of long hair. In particular, shortly before the Travellers' exhibition, Pavel Tretyakov wrote to Polenov: \"I remarked something to you, and I can still remark it afterwards, as you yourself know very well. It's a pity that Christ has short hair – this is something you do not seem to agree with.\" According to the writer and critic Mikhail Chekhov, Polenov painted the face of Christ from the artist Isaac Levitan.\nSeated next to Christ are his disciples, including Peter, John, James, and Judas. The figures of the Pharisee and Sadducee are positioned at the forefront of the crowd, in which the sinner is situated. The Pharisee is depicted as the most assertive, and he appears to be the individual who poses the question to Christ. To his left, the red-haired, well-fed Sadducee is depicted with a snide smile. Despite their enmity, in this episode they are united against Christ. \nAccording to Polenov, and with the assistance of his wife Natalia Vasilievna, the art critic Alexander Sobolev produced a detailed description of the painting, which was subsequently published in Russkiye Vedomosti in 1887 and in a separate brochure. According to this description, the boy seated on the ledge of the temple stairs is Mark, one of the future evangelists. To the right of Christ is John, and to the left is James, with Peter leaning on his staff behind him. In the same row as Peter are Andrew, Philip and James, son of Alphaeus, and in the second row are Judas, Cleopas and Matthew. The man with his face half-covered, standing by the cypress tree behind Christ's disciples, is Nicodemus the Pharisee, one of Christ's secret disciples. In the foreground, by the wicker baskets, is Mary, the mother of Mark, with her maid Rhoda beside her. The elderly man leaving the temple with the younger man is the Pharisee Gamaliel, a learned rabbi who would, following the execution of Jesus, intercede in the Sanhedrin on behalf of his disciples-apostles. The woman depicted on the steps of the temple is the widow from the Gospels, whom Jesus described as \"more beautiful than marvellous slabs of marble\". The man on the right side of the painting is Simon of Cyrene, who is to carry the cross for Christ's crucifixion to Golgotha in the future.\n\n\n== Studies, sketches and reproductions ==\nDuring his many years of work on the subject associated with the canvas Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, Polenov produced more than 150 drawings, studies, sketches and versions of the painting.\nThe Polenovo Estate Museum houses one of Polenov's earliest sketches of the subject, created in 1873. Additionally, the museum's collection includes a sketch from 1884 (oil, 23 × 45 cm), which was transferred from France in the 1980s, and a full-length sketch from 1885, executed in charcoal on canvas (307 × 585 cm).\nThe State Tretyakov Gallery houses an oil sketch for Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (1876, wood, oil, 22.2 × 34.7 cm, inv. 10581), which was acquired from Nikolay Krymov in 1930. Additionally, there is a later sketch from 1885 (canvas, oil, 26 × 48 cm, inv. 11142), which was previously owned by Ilya Ostroukhov and transferred in 1929 from the Ostroukhov Museum. Another sketch, dated 1884, belongs to the Kharkiv Art Museum.\nThe State Russian Museum houses 27 studies for the painting. Four additional studies are held by the Tretyakov Gallery. Several studies are part of the collection of the Polenovo Museum. At least two studies for this painting were in the collection of the Rumyantsev Museum. After the museum's dissolution in 1924, one study (Christ, 1880s, oil on canvas, 114 × 75 cm) was transferred to the Yekaterinburg Museum of Fine Arts, and another (Head of an Old Man, 1883, oil on canvas, 27 × 22 cm) was trasferred to the Omsk Regional Museum of Fine Arts named after M. A. Vrubel. The sketches for the painting are also held in a number of other museums and private collections.\nA number of reduced author's reproductions of the painting with the same name exist. One of these, undated, is held in a private collection in Moscow. The other, dated 1888 and created with the help of Sergei Korovin, is in the V. P. Sukachev Irkutsk Regional Art Museum (canvas, oil, 150 × 266 cm).\nThe catalogue of the State Russian Museum notes the existence of another author's reproduction, dated 1907, which was exhibited at the Russian Art Exhibition in the United States in 1924. It is likely that this is the same painting which was sold in November 2011 at Bonhams' Russian auction in London for £4,073,250, or approximately $5,381,742 (oil on canvas, 118 × 239 cm), under the title He That Is Without Sin Among You. Although the painting sold at the auction is dated 1908, it was written about as having participated in the 1924 exhibition in New York, where it was acquired by Charles Richard Crane. Prior to the auction, in October 2011, the artist's reproduction was exhibited at the Tretyakov Gallery as part of a preview of the lots.\n\n\n== Reviews and criticism ==\nIn his article The Exhibition of the Peredvizhniki, published on 1 March 1887, in the Novosty I Birzhevaya Gazeta, the art critic Vladimir Stasov devoted only a few sentences to Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery. He noted that a detailed account of this significant work would require a separate article; however, he never wrote it. Stasov noted that in working on this painting Polenov \"approached his task very carefully, travelled to Palestine, studied on the spot the architecture, the local types of people and nature, the light effects\"; all of this produced \"very interesting and powerful results\". Stasov went on to write: \"I will say in passing that part of Herod's temple, still extant, elegant pillars with ornamented capitals in the corner of the temple, the steps leading down from the temple, where the famous Gospel scene takes place, everything is colourful and elegant, illuminated by the bright Palestinian sun. In general, Polenov remained a graceful, elegant painter, as we have known him for a long time, since the beginning of his career in 1871. But to this he also added great skill and picturesqueness in the transfer of landscape\". The writer and critic Vsevolod Garshin in his Notes on Art Exhibitions, published in March 1887 in the Saint Petersburg magazine Severny Vestnik, praised Polenov's painting, in which, in his words, \"there is not a single [instance of] what they call drapery, it is all a real dress, clothes; and the artist, who has closely studied the East, has managed to dress his heroes in such a way that they really wear clothes, live in them, rather than put them on for scaffolding or posing in front of a painter\".\nIn his article Two Paintings, published in 1887 in Russkie Vedomosti, the writer and publicist Vladimir Korolenko provides a detailed analysis of the depiction of Christ in Polenov's painting. He wrote that \"at first glance at a painting it is as if you do not notice its main figure\", but this is only a superficial impression caused by a sudden feeling of inconsistency with established ideas. \"The more you gaze at this remarkable figure, with its physical strength instead of its ascetic half-airiness, with its carelessly dropped hand on its knee, with all that unnoticed fatigue of a weary but strong man, and above all with that remarkable expression of face, the more the initial feeling is replaced by wonder, respect, love.\" According to Korolenko, he saw in the image of Christ \"a remarkable success of artistic realism\".\n\nThe artist Yeghishe Tadevosyan described Polenov's Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery as \"a bright, cheerful, hot-sunny work\", and called it \"a daring challenge to religious prudes\".\nThe art historian Aleksei Fedorov-Davydov posited that, having rejected the tenets of official religion and ecclesiasticism, Polenov in his work had offered a realistic interpretation of both Christ and the entirety of the Gospel narrative. Nevertheless, he noted that \"the depiction of a religious subject as a scene of alive real life becomes, so to speak, an end in itself\". According to Fedorov-Davydov, such abstractness and lack of content were \"akin to the formal understanding of the subject in academism\". The realism in Polenov's painting is primarily evident in the form, or the means of depiction, rather than in the content, and that is why \"he could get along with the traditions of academic historical painting\". Nevertheless, in comparison with the painting Christ and the Sinner by the academic painter Henryk Siemiradzki, Fedorov-Davydov asserted that Polenov's work was \"more serious, noble, substantial and artistic\". In his opinion, \"Polenov's painting is the most significant and serious\" among the attempts to revive large-format academic historical painting.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nБахревский, В.А.

        "revision_id": 1221223330,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Maquis of Fizi was a breakaway state  in the  Maquis movement in what comprises parts of the modern territory of Fizi that broke off from Zaïre and existed from 1967 until 1986. Besides the contemporary Territory of Fizi, at its peak it also went as far as Kabambara in the west and Mwenga in the north.\nThe territory was created after the failures of the Simba rebellion as a revolutionary redoubt by Laurent-Désiré Kabila with a contingent of a couple thousand men. Although it was completely unrecognized internationally, it enjoyed some aid and assistance from Maoist China as it adopted policies similar to Maoist doctrine. It dissolved in 1986 when its weapon supplies ran thin, informants and spies caused chaos in government and the territory began to run out of resources to extract. Kabila escaped all the way to Uganda, being found there in the tail-end of the 1980s, eventually leading a Ugandan-backed revolt against the Zairian government.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Simba rebellion's failure was disastrous for the Congolese left, which found itself increasingly disorganized and broken. In this context, Kabila had met with Che Guevara to lobby for assistance from Cuba. Nonetheless, Guevara remained mostly unconvinced and Kabila was simply recognized as having \"tremendous leadership skills\".\nBefore the rebellion, the Fizi area experienced numerous controversies, which constituted factors and conditions favorable to the outbreak of the rebellion. In 1963, a district was planned in Fizi which would be called the district of \"Akye Ato\". But, during the debate on the establishment of this district, the deputies of Fizi in the province (Bukavu), notably Mutambala Dieudonné, Jean Abedi, and Makangila Jérôme did not agree on the same solution; the first two wanted the district to be established in Uvira,'4 the third defended the cause of Fizi. The majority won and the district was established in Uvira.\nThe rumors about this controversy divided the Bembeans in Fizi, and a dispute arose during the promulgation of the creation of the province of central Kivu, on May 18, 1963, some wanted the Fizi zone be part of the province of Central Kivu, others, of Maniema, and still others of North Katanga. Before elucidating this situation, the tension increased further following the assassination of a sector councilor - Samuel Mangapi arrested by the administrator Limoko, of Fizi territory, with 250 other people, as members of the MNC/L-Fizi. Mangapi was assassinated by members of the Bembe elite association in Bukavu, on the orders of Mutambala Dieudonné, because he wanted the Fizi zone to join the Maniema province. The Bembe, who were mostly supporters of the MNC/L5, were outraged by this death; it would be the basis of strong tension between the supporters of the MNC/L and those loyal to the administrator Limoko.\nAs for the promulgation of the law creating the province of Central Kivu and submitting the territory of Fizi to the referendum, the Bembe leaders and advisors were divided into several tendencies. Some councilors had signed three petitions, one for Maniema, another for North Katanga, and a third for Central Kivu. This attitude reflected the triple attraction that was exerted simultaneously on the Bembe. The between supporters of the attachment to Maniema on the one hand, and those who wanted to see the territory incorporated into North Katanga or Central Kivu on the other hand, overlapped with the opposition between militant executives of the MNC/L (ex-UNEBAFI) and customary authorities.\n\n\n== The beginnings of the rebellion ==\nThe popular and anti-bourgeois character of the rebellion emerges from certain declarations made in Fizi by local rebel leaders against the elite and the political-administrative class in place. All those who participated in power during the old regime are accused of being \"PNP\", that is to say enemies of the people and independence. However, it was not the very principle of power and administrative organization that was called into question, as was the case in Kwilu, it was rather the incumbents at the time.\nThe organization of the Kabila maquis was facilitated by a certain readiness for revolution already present among the Bembe, frustrated by the failure of the 1964 rebellion, and overwhelmed by military (FAZ) and administrative harassment, following the crushing of the rebellion in 1966. To this, we must add the fact that Kabila took advantage of his familiarity with the Bembe of Lulenge, Ngandja and Itombwe, who had known him since the first rebellion. Thus, his group grew quickly and his maquis reached a fairly high level of efficiency and organization, thanks to his well-read experience with Marxist–Leninist theory with a view to the establishment of a democratic and socialist state. This is where Kabila and Ndalo's rebellion had begun to take shape. The Republic, thus, was declared on October 24, 1967.\n\n\n== Consolidation ==\nOn December 7, 1967, in Makanga-Tubaone, President Kabila summoned all rebels, combatants and civilians alike, to a congress. During which, he identified the seven errors at the root of the failure of the 1964 rebellion. These ranged from lack of Party organization to tribal sectarianism. The congress was entirely assembled in Swahili. Besides grievances with the Simba rebellion itself, the Republic also focused on criticizing the government in Kinshasa as well for its comprador class, its lack of accountability to the people, among other grievances.\nAfter the consolidation of the Republic itself, in the town of Makanga-Tubaone, Kabila's allies and government ministers - Yumbu Gabriel, Masengo Ildephonse, Umba Jeanson - created, on December 24, 1967, a political party for the new territory. It would be called the PRP, or People's Revolution Party (Parti de la Révolution Populaire).\nWithin the party, many Maoist principles would be enacted; party cadres would function as ideal members of society and representatives of the Party, women's and youth divisions would be created to further instill revolutionary values into the population, and political commissars would be appointed for the Fizian army.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Fizi area is an agricultural area par excellence, and the Bembe are above all farmers, even if hunting remains a significant activity for them. The regions of Baraka, Ubwari, Lulenge, Kaboke and Lubondja were particularly favorable to agriculture. A whole range of market gardening and food crops were grown: beans, peas, cabbage, sorghum, sweet potatoes, peanuts, corn, bananas, paddy, yams, and especially cassava, which constitutes the staple food of the Bembe. When the fields to be cultivated are vast areas, the work is carried out collectively. The owner of the field must have offered food and drink to all members of his farm. This is the \"esale\", one of the best frameworks for expressing Bembe solidarity and brotherhood. Colonization introduced so-called industrial crops. Three of these crops were (and are) grown in the Fizi area.  Both varieties of Arabica and Robusta coffee are grown, the first on the Mutambala mountains, the second on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Oil palm and cotton were also cultivated in the coastal plain.\n\n\n== Government structure ==\nDue to the chaotic nature of civil wars and rebellions, alongside the relative isolation of the maquis, it is impossible to denote exact specifics on government structure in the Republic, but the President, in this case Kabila, served for life, and would cycle through vice-presidents by democratic elections, alongside the appointment of a General Secretary of the PRP.\nWhen the line of power was more or less clarified, the People's Revolution Party set up a leadership team at different levels of power: At the center was the President, a Revolutionary Military Commission, the Party's Central Committee, local popular Assemblies and the administration of subdivisions.\nThe first cabinet of the Fizi territory, in 1967, was structured as follows:\n\nMinistry of Internal Affairs: Malaka Baudouin\nEconomy Ministry: Kakozi Saleh\nForeign Affairs: Laurent-Désiré Kabila\nFinancial affairs and Treasury: Kamimbi David\nJustice Ministry: Mangaza Efrazie\nMinistry of Social Affairs: Mwati Joseph\nCentral Bureau of Provisions: Dewambele Sungura\nLabor Ministry: Mutchungu Jerôme\nPropaganda Ministry: Kilenga Saleh\nTransport Ministry: Mukendi Zakaria\nDepartment of State Security: Bisagiro Jeannot\nMilitary Commander of the Port: Talama Onesphor\nMilitary Base Administrator: Asani Bruno\n\n\n== Decline and collapse ==\nThe failures and decline of the Republic began to be noticeable from 1979, when Kabila began to commit repeated acts of injustice. Clothes and other goods, intended for the poor, as provided for in social affairs, and for combatants, were distributed by Kabila to his friends via nepotism. The repetition of these acts outraged the Army, some officers and commanders, and the majority of the population. The soldiers, stimulated by the dissatisfied officers, began to revolt, showing indiscipline, discouragement, and even a certain relaxation. Adding to these issues, Kabila began to rule by decree, ignoring the government structure he had created around him. Kabila, thus had produced a drastic solution: All sorcerers, cursers and mages of the \"Red Zone\" (the existing controlled regions of the Republic) would be executed. As a test, Kabila had produced a potion which would verify someone's status as a sorcerer: If they felt dizzy and nauseous upon consuming the potion, they would be burned alive on the spot, as it made it clear that they were one. 90% of the executed were men in old age. This operation had disturbed all the partisans and had sowed disarray in the PRP. Some, who did not want to take the potion because of their physical weakness, had fled and returned to the rest of Zaire. The waves of escapees had become so common that Kabila noticed the disappearance of many people and agricultural reports made mention of it. After a while, the operation was called off.\nThis operation had singlehandedly caused immense distrust around Kabila by his cadres and had sowed the seeds of collapse into Fizi. Starvation and isolation in the Red Zone had also meant immense difficulties for the average Fizian by this time. Other mistakes included the movement of loyal troops to Lake Tanganyika's coast, resulting in even less security for the capital of Fizi.\nA small civil war thus broke out, resulting in the collapse of the Zone and Kabila's fleeing to Uganda. The Red Zone was thus almost entirely occupied by Zairian soldiers by the end of 1986.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSimba rebellion\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLes illusions africaines de Che Guevara",

Willem Jan finished his high school education in Deventer, the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Early Navy career ==\nIn 1924 Willem Jan began his Navy career as naval cadet at the Royal Naval Institute in Den Helder, where he was a member of the senate in 1925. One of his passions was ocean sailing. On August 16, 1927, he was appointed midshipman and on August 16, 1929, he became sub lieutenant.\nOn August 20, 1935, he married Anna Troll (1911–1998) by proxy. She was a daughter of Navy Officer Anton Frederik Lodewijk Troll (1875–1936) and Gesina Sara Hoek (1883–1956). From 1935 to 1938, Willem Jan was artillery officer aboard HNLMS Johan Maurits van Nassau, first stationed at the island of Curaçao in the Dutch Caribbean, and later escorting convoys  in the Strait of Gibraltar. Willem Jan was promoted to lieutenant commander on August 15, 1938, and subsequently posted to the Department of the Navy in The Hague.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\nIn May 1940, at the beginning of World War II, as German forces invaded the Netherlands, Willem Jan was transferred to London with Dutch admiral Johan Fürstner, among others, in charge of the Dutch Admiralty's relocation to the United Kingdom. He was initially stationed in Bath as liaison officer.\nOn May 6, 1942, he became captain of HNLMS Tjerk Hiddes, a British N-class destroyer launched on 25 June 1941 and transferred to the Royal Dutch Navy in May 1942. The ship was named after the 17th century Dutch admiral, Tjerk Hiddes de Vries.\nWith HNLMS Tjerk Hiddes, Willem Jan actively participated in the fight against the enemy, initially escorting military convoy ships in the Indian Ocean. In October, the ship joined the US 7th Fleet in the Port of Fremantle, Australia.\nEarly December, Tjerk Hiddes was sent on a mission to evacuate troops from the island of Timor in enemy territory. On the way to Darwin, the ship was spotted and attacked by a squadron of Japanese bombers from Timor. Willem Jan manoeuvred his ship successfully to avoid the bombs, but was forced to dump the depth charges to prevent that a hit or near miss on the stern would detonate the charges and damage or sink the ship. On 9, 12 and 18 December, the Tjerk Hiddes made three nightly voyages to Timor and evacuated over a thousand Australian Forces, Dutch troops and civilians to Darwin.\nOn January 8, 1943, during maintenance work, one of the ship's torpedos exploded, blowing a hole in the deck. Four Australian technicians and two crew members required treatment in hospital.\nWillem Jan was awarded the Legion of Merit by President Roosevelt for the Timor mission. The crew received the Dutch Cross for Important Military Operations (also known as the Expedition Cross). The British King George VI decorated Willem Jan with the Order of the British Empire (Officer Military Decision).\n\n\n== Post-war period ==\n\nIn 1945 Willem Jan was appointed head of Navy training in London and in 1948 he was promoted to commander. He was closely involved in the 1948 Dutch-Indonesian round table negotiations regarding the transfer of sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies. He stayed in Australia for a number of months for the Royal Dutch Navy. On 1 August 1952 he was promoted to captain and sent back to The Hague. He was involved with the construction of the two new Zeven Provinciën class light cruisers De Ruyter and De Zeven Provinciën.\nOn November 18, 1953, he became the first captain of the cruiser HNLMS De Ruyter, built at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard in Rotterdam. The ship was commissioned in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Juliana of the Netherlands.\nIn August 1955 Willem Jan was appointed interim rear admiral, and on September 4, 1956, he became rear admiral. His promotion to vice admiral followed on September 4, 1958, making him the third admiral in the Kruys family.\n\n\n== Civilian career ==\nWillem Jan retired from the Royal Dutch Navy on September 16, 1960. He became deputy director-general of the National Aviation Service (Rijksluchtvaartdienst), and from 1962 to 1971 director-general.\nWillem Jan and his wife Anna Troll had a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren. Willem Jan died in Bilthoven on April 20, 1985.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Édgar Calel (b. 1987) is a Maya-Kaqchikel visual artist and poet from Chi Xot, San Juan Comapala, Guatemala.Calel is known for multimedia contemporary art that explores the complexities of indigenous experiences and engages with the Maya-Kaqchikel cosmic worldview, traditions, and rituals to new publics internationally. Calel's artwork has been exhibited in exhibitions and galleries in Europe and North America, including the Liverpool Biennial,Berlin Biennale, Tate Modern, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Sculpture Center, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, and the National Gallery of Canada, with his works featuring in the national collections of the UK and Canada, among other countries. In 2023, Calel was included in Phaidon Press's Latin American Artists: From 1785 to Now.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nÉdgar Calel was born in 1987 in Chi Xot, San Juan Comapala, an indigenous Maya Kaqchikel community in the highlands of Guatemala. At age 19, Calel received a scholarship to study at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas \"Rafael Rodríguez Padilla\" in Guatemala City.\nFollowing his studies at ENAP, Calel traveled throughout Central America developing his practice. In 2008, Calel was invited to a residency program at the Escuela de Arte Espira/La Espora in Managua, Nicaragua. From there, he went on to further residencies throughout Latin America, including in Córdoba, Argentina and Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\nCalel is associated with a broader collective of Guatemalan artists, many represented by Proyectos Ultravioleta, and is considered a leader of a new wave of institutional critique that has garnered media attention for their artistic responses to power dynamics and historical shifts, contributing to the visibility of a generation of indigenous Guatemalan artists on the international stage.\n\n\n== Work ==\nCalel works as a poet and multimedia artist with a focus on the ancestral culture and indigenous experience of the Maya Kaqchikel community. His work is noted for incorporating the Kaqchikel spirituality, rituals, and communal practices and using contemporary art to transmit these aspects to a wider public. His works often draw attention to the violence, racial discrimination, and exclusion faced by indigenous communities in modern Guatemala, particularly in the course and aftermath of the Guatemalan Civil War.\nIn 2021, Calel gained attention for his novel approach to art custodianship in his installation \"'Ru k’ox k’ob’el jun ojer etemab’el' (The Echo of an Ancient Form of Knowledge).\"  Recognizing that the installation, which incorporates Maya-Kaqchikel rituals blessings, cannot be reduced to its physical form, the Tate worked with Calel to establish a unique custodial agreement in which the Tate acquired the installation, without owning it outright, for a period of 13 years (a number corresponding to the 13 joints of the human body in the Mayan cosmic worldview). Speaking on the acquisition of Calel's installation, Gregor Muir, Tate's Director of Collection, said:\n\"Functioning like altarpieces on which we see sacrificial fruits and vegetables, his arrangement of rocks with all their associated rituals challenge the very concept of what it is to own something. The work purposely asks us to redefine collecting through a custodial agreement whereby the Tate retains a direct line to the artist and the Maya community. While we can never own Calel’s installation, we have much to learn from its intrinsic questioning.\"\nAccording to a statement by Tate, once this 13-year custodianship of the work ends, \"a new agreement will be made with the artist and his community, either to renew this custodianship, to pass it on to another institution, or to return the elements of the work to the earth.\"\nIn the 2023 Liverpool Biennial, Calel worked alongside other artists from the global south, exhibiting art that responded to the city of Liverpool's role in the transatlantic slave trade. Calel spoke of his work acting \"as a form of resistance in the wake of ongoing racism, social exclusion and cultural erasure of Indigenous people.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The fuller (or cloth cleaner) and the charcoal burner (or collier) is one of Aesop's Fables and numbered 29 in the Perry Index.\n\n\n== The fable ==\n\nA charcoal burner proposed to his friend the fuller that they share quarters in the same house, but the fuller replied, \"That would be impossible, for whatever I whitened, you would immediately blacken again\". The story is from an ancient Greek situational fable involving human characters which teaches that opposites are incompatible. Cicero later seems to draw a political moral from the fable in one of his letters, in which he discusses the irreconcilability between republicans and supporters of Julius Caesar. And in the Victorian era, the preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon applied what he called \"the well-worn fable\" to religious difference. \nIn Renaissance times there were 16th century poetic versions of the fable in Neo-Latin by Gabriele Faerno and by Hieronymus Osius. The latter concludes with the sentiment that\n\nDifference is far from such accord\nThat only likeness will afford.\nAn English version of the story appeared in the 1692 fable collection of Roger L'Estrange with the very broad application that \"Tis a necessary Rule in Alliances, Matches, Societies, Fraternities, Friendships, Partnerships, Commerce, and all manner of civil dealings and Contracts, to have a strict Regard to Humour, the Nature, and the Disposition of those we have to do withal.\" Samuel Croxall also featured it in 1722 under the title of \"The Collier and the Fuller\" and Thomas Bewick with the same title in 1784.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIllustrations of the fable from the 15th to 19th centuries",

        "content": "Wasif Hussain Nadeem al-Wajidi (born 23 July 1954), also spelled Maulana Nadeem-Ul-Wajidi, is an Indian Islamic scholar, columnist, critic, and writer who specializes in Urdu and Arabic language and literature. He is the father of Yasir Nadeem al Wajidi.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNadeem al-Wajidi was born on July 23, 1954 in Deoband. His birth name is Wasif Hussain, suggested by Hussain Ahmad Madani.\nHis family was also literary, and his family settled in Deoband from Bijnor about a century and a half ago. His grandfather Ahmad Hasan Deobandi was the Sheikh al-Hadith of Jamia Miftahul Uloom, Jalalabad, and his father Wajid Husain Deobandi was the Sheikh al-Hadith of Jamia Islamia Talimuddin, Dabhel. His maternal uncle, Sharif Hasan Deobandi was Sheikh-ul-Hadith of Darul Uloom Deoband.\nHe received his primary education in Deoband, then at Madrasa Miftahul Uloom in Jalalabad, where he got academic benefits from Masihullah Khan Sherwani also.\nAfter that, in 1967, he was enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband, and graduated from there in 1974 (1393 AH). After graduation, he studied Arabic language and literature for two more years in the departments of completion of Arabic literature and specialization in Arabic literature in Darul Uloom.\nHe is one of the notable students of Wahiduzzaman Kairanawi. He was appointed as the representative of Darul Uloom's Arabic student club An-Nadi al-Adabi by Kairanawi. At that time, he used to bring out a wall magazine called Ash-Shu'oor from the same club.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Nadeem taught for one year in a seminary in Arabia in Hyderabad, Deccan, on the orders of his teachers, Sharif Hasan Deobandi, Naseer Ahmad Khan, and Muhammad Naeem Deobandi. Then, in 1978, the advisory council of Darul Uloom Deoband chose him as the supervisor of the writing and compilation department of the centenary celebration, where he worked for two years and published various books and magazines in Arabic and Urdu. In 1978, he founded the Arabic Teaching Center in Deoband, from which thousands of students benefited for years. Seven such books were published under this center and have been included in the curricula of several madrasas.\nIn 1980, after the centenary celebration of Darul Uloom Deoband, he established a publishing house called Darul Kitab in Deoband itself,  and in the period of seven years between 1980 and 1987, he translated Al-Ghazali's renowned book, Ihyā-ul-Uloom, in installments, which was published in four volumes in Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Dhaka in Bangladesh. From this publishing house, he has also published numerous books on academic and non-curricular subjects in local and foreign countries such as Beirut, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt, and now this library is a well-known and famous library in the subcontinent.\nIn 2001, he established the first residential educational institution for girls in Deoband under the name of Ma'had Ayesha As-Sadiqah in Deoband in an effort to correct the deterioration of Muslim society, especially women, in the name of women's freedom. He appointed his wife as manager for internal affairs, who is himself an Islamic scholar.\nHe is the President of the All India Tanzeem-e-Ulama-e-Hind and a General Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, among other posts.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\nNadeem started writing essays in his student days, and he was encouraged in his writing by the fortnightly Urdu magazine Makarz of Deoband. He was the editor of the wall magazine Shu'oor during his student life. From that time until 2013, about 400 of his articles had been published in quality newspapers and magazines in the country and abroad, and thirteen collections of his articles had been published until 2013. His articles are often published in the magazines Darul Uloom Deoband, Naya Daur Lucknow, Aaj Kal, Rashtriya Sahara, Daily Sahafat, Sada-e-Dawat, etc. He is one of the current Indian literature in Arabic.

        "content": "Sebene, also known as seben, is an instrumental section commonly played in Congolese rumba. It is usually played towards the end of the song and is the dancing section where the lead and rhythm guitars take the lead in the dance. It is characterized by the repetition of a specific number of notes during the passage of second chords: one major chord and one-seventh chord, which gives rise to the Lingala derivation \"sebene,\" derived from the English numeral \"seven\" or its ordinal rendition. \nGuitarists use a combination of lead and rhythm guitar to produce a distinct sound that is accompanied by vocalists, including an atalaku who energetically engages the audience and may call out to sponsors. The use of arpeggios, rapid chord changes, atalaku, and melodic embellishments is extensive in sebene and gives Congolese rumba a dynamic and energetic rhythm. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to most Congolese musicologists, the term sebene was adapted from the English numeral seven. Although this attribution ostensibly ensues from folk etymology, it is believed that Congolese musicians assimilated this terminology from the palm-wine guitar tradition prevalent among West African migrants who resettled in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) during the early 1900s and \"whose music was interspersed with seventh chords (\"seventh\" → \"seben\")\". Their music was believed to instill a sense of suspense conducive to dance. While alternate descriptive designations (e.g., \"chauffée,\" \"saccadée,\" \"animation,\" \"partie dansante,\" \"ambiance\") are used to delineate this musical interlude, sebene stands as the oldest and pervasive terminology extensively preferred by musicians.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nDuring a sebene interlude, the drummer signals changes. At each cue, the guitarists change parts in a prearranged way, synchronizing their performances to complement the lead player's line. According to Guy-Léon Fylla, for the tonal center C, the successive notes would encompass:\n\nTonic: Do, Mi, Sol\n7th chord: Sol\nLower octave: Fa, Sol\nThis constitutes a dynamic and commanding musical interlude, allowing the solo guitar to conclude an improvisational passage before recommencing vocalization or facilitating the alternation for the expression of another instrument, customarily the brass (trumpets), the woodwinds (saxophones, clarinets), or keyboards, for which it then serves as a substratum for execution.\nThe degree recurrently prevalent in a song is I, IV, V.  There are five main cadences that characterize sebene: \n\nHalf-time: Corresponding to the I–IV–V–I progression.\nDouble stroke: Corresponding to the I–IV–V–IV progression.\n3 stroke: Corresponding to the I–V–IV–V progression.\n4 stroke: Corresponding to the I–VII–IV–V progression.\nSeventh chord: Corresponding to the V–IV progression.\nThe musical beat is delineated through a sequential count akin to a metronome, typically enumerating as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. In the context of African music, chord changes, or degree shifts, typically occur every two or four pulses.\nDuring the instrumental section of sebene, the rhythmic section momentarily recedes, creating an open space for the proliferation of intricate, syncopated guitar refrains. As expounded in John Conteh-Morgan and Tejumola Olaniyan's \"African Drama and Performance,\" after the ending of the last line of the chorus by singers, \"the lead guitarist then kicks off the seben with a guitar rill that is slightly accelerated and is soon joined by the drummer's snare, the atalakus marakas (now acting as a rattle), and a random scream from somewhere off-mic\".\nAlthough old Congolese rumba pieces from the 1940s-1960s did not feature atalakus, the introduction of the atalaku in 1982, pioneered by Nono Monzuluku and Bébé Atalaku of Zaïko Langa Langa, emerged as a seminal innovation. Throughout the sebene, the atalakus' primary function is to galvanize people to dance, which they achieve through an amalgam of shouts, sung refrains, and vocal embellishments. In addition to vocal exhortations, the atalakus are instrumentalists and dancers, using a shaker to enhance the rhythmic pulse while also intermittently leaving the microphone to join the dance ensemble.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of sebene is a subject of contentious debate, with differing attributions and perspectives. Guy-Léon Fylla and Clément Ossinondé credit Antoine Kasongo's Odéon Kinois Orchestra with pioneering the style, while Congolese musicologist Audifax Bemba posits that guitarist Zacharie Élenga, known as Jhimmy L'hawaïenne, introduced sebene during his brief stint within the orchestra. Conversely, British musicologist Gary Stewart contends that sebene made its debut appearance in Antoine Wendo Kolosoy's 1948 critically acclaimed hit \"Marie-Louise,\" featuring a duet with Henri Bowane, wherein Wendo sings his affection for a woman confronting familial dissent. Bowane advises Wendo that his rhetoric is futile, and they should abscond with her to Kingabwa. Bowane then exclaims \"Yoka sebene,\" segueing into a guitar solo. According to Stewart, this instance popularized the term \"sebene\" as a prolonged instrumental interlude. \nNonetheless, certain Congolese musicians propose an alternative origin, suggesting that sebene originated with Coastmen from West Africa who were resettled in Léopoldville by colonialists after the first surge of the Second World War, to work in the inaugural Dutch and Belgian factories. These Coastmen founded the Excelsior Orchestra in the port town of Boma on the north bank of the Congo River. This group was a replica of Accra's Excelsior and enlivened weekends with highlife songs in bars (often rudimentary or constructed from reeds) and on street corners, hosting traditional Kongo's maringa dance performances, with European instrumentation: guitar, saxophone, two-bell trumpet, chromatic accordion, and piano. Congolese guitarists enthusiastically incorporated the seventh chord into their solos, frequently signaling one another with exclamations of \"seven,\" which evolved into the term \"sebene.\"\n\nFélix Manuaku Waku is also often cited as a pioneering figure in the development of sebene (merging Fiesta and Odemba rumba schools), although some trace its origins further back to transitional genres like the kebo. According to Stewart, the segment where most dancing transpired was called the sebene. One Lingala dictionary defines \"sebene\" as dance, though the exact point of its linguistic assimilation remains uncertain. Regardless of its provenance, sebene burgeoned in popularity during the 1950s, with Franco Luambo emerging as a leading practitioner, popularizing a primarily guitar-based sebene explicitly associated with physical release (défoulement). \nThree essential elements converged to create a successful sebene: the cavacha rhythm, a distinctive lead guitar style, and the exclamations of the atalaku. While song sections may exhibit diverse rhythms and tempos, the cavacha rhythm, characterized by its onomatopoeic name, remains remarkably consistent across groups and time periods. Meridjo Belobi, the drummer of Zaïko Langa Langa, is credited with popularizing the cavacha rhythm, which is played primarily on the snare or hi-hats, lending a solid, driving feel to the rhythm.\nThe atalaku, whose name purportedly stems from the Kikongo expression for \"look here, look at me,\" plays a crucial role in creating an atmosphere of excitement during sebene performances. Their improvisational prowess, combining shouts, melodies, and vocal pyrotechnics, aims to incite both the audience and fellow musicians to lose themselves in the music, despite their relative obscurity compared to other band members.\n\n\n== References ==",

The first track operated just after World War II and was located in the area of the modern day Herningsholm Museum and from 1956 to 1965 the speedway was held in nearby village of Sinding.\nIn 1967, the speedway team Uldjyderne won the bronze medal in the Danish league tournament.\nThe current venue at Uhrebanen was acquired in the late 1960s when moorland by the civil and military airfield was converted into a motocross track, the speedway track soon followed after opening in 1971.\nDuring the late 1980s, the name Uldjyderne was dropped in favour of Motorsport Herning and in 1999, the Herning Motor Sport club split into two sections, one for speedway (Herning Speedway Klub) and one for motocross (Herning Motocross Klub). In 2000, the Herning Speedway Klub won the silver medal during the 2000 Danish speedway season, which was their most significant honour to date.\nThe club's chairman Kenneth Emil Nielsen received the Herning City Council's annual sports management award for 2022 for his efforts associated with the club.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Adventist University Center of São Paulo (Portuguese: Centro Universitário Adventista de São Paulo), also known as UNASP, is a basic and higher education institution that integrates the Seventh-day Adventist education system. It has 3 campuses in the state of São Paulo: São Paulo (headquarters), Engenheiro Coelho, and Hortolândia. It also runs an application center in Artur Nogueira and offers distance education. \nIt dates back to the end of the 19th century when the first theological training course was launched. The first departments beyond theology were established in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1999, it became a university center.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation of mission schools ===\n\nAdventist education in Brazil began in the southern region at the end of the 19th century. At the time, the leadership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA) created the first elementary schools in the cities of Curitiba and Gaspar to support the development of Adventist work in Brazil. Faced with expansion, the SDA decided to establish a preparatory school to train the future leaders and missionaries of the church who would serve throughout Brazil.\nOn October 15, 1897, the first SDA school was founded in the city of Gaspar Alto under the name Colégio Internacional de Gaspar Alto (English: Gaspar Alto International School). On August 19, 1903, on the recommendation of the SDA, the college was transferred to Taquari with the name Colégio Superior de Taquari (Taquari High School). In 1904, John Lipke assumed the directorship and in 1910, the institution closed. \n\n\n=== Establishment in Santo Amaro ===\nThe property of the Colégio Superior de Taquari was sold by the Adventist Church of Rio Grande do Sul for Rs$11, which would be used to found a new school. On April 28, 1915, the Association of Seventh-day Adventists in Brazil purchased a 145-hectare propertyin the district of Capão Redondo, in São Paulo, for Rs$20. On May 6, 1915, the area was occupied and activities began. Tents were assembled to provide the missionaries and students with a place to sleep, eat and store materials until the first building was constructed.\nOn July 3, 1915, classes began in improvised structures with 12 students. On August 1, 1915, the cornerstone was laid for the first building of the Colégio da União Conferência Brasileira dos Adventistas do Sétimo Dia (Brazilian Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Union School). It had John Lipke as headmaster, John Boehm as manager and Paulo Hening and Augusta Boehm as teachers. In 1922, the school celebrated the first graduation with nine students from the ministerial and normal courses.\nFrom 1925, the school's management invested in an agro-industrial boarding school with the breeding of Dutch dairy cattle imported from the United States. In 1932, it began producing juices and whole foods, which later became the Superbom food company. In 1937, the high school was formalized and in 1942, it received the name Colégio Adventista Brasileiro (Brazilian Adventist School - CAB). Between the 1940s and 1960s, the main secondary-technical courses were made official.\n\n\n=== Creation of departments and institutes ===\n\nIn 1940, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists authorized the creation of a nursing course in Brazil. However, the difficulties of forming a teaching staff delayed the launch of the course until 1943, when it began classes on the premises of the Casa de Saúde Liberdade (now the São Paulo Adventist Hospital). The first class graduated in 1945. At the time, the course lacked organization and was not part of a faculty.\nIn 1950, new structures were built in Capão Redondo to include the nursing course, which would be relocated there. In 1962, the Colégio Adventista Brasileiro was renamed the Instituto Adventista de Ensino (Adventist Educational Institute - IAE) to accommodate the different programs planned. On May 30, 1968, the Faculdade Adventista de Enfermagem (Adventist Faculty of Nursing - FAE) was authorized to operate by Decree No. 62,800 issued by the National Education Council (CNE).\nIn 1971, the SDA in São Paulo started a pedagogy course linked to the Faculty of Theology in order to train teachers for the Adventist schools that existed in Brazil. In 1973, through Decree No. 72.610, the Faculdade Adventista de Educação (Adventist Faculty of Education - FAEd) was authorized to operate legally. The IAE Deliberative Council voted in favor of converting the IAE into the Universidade Adventista do Brasil (Adventist University of Brazil - UAB/UNABRA), but the project fell through.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nIn 1979, São Paulo City Hall expropriated the IAE area (currently the São Paulo campus) and reduced the size of the land by 80%. In 1983, the Adventist Church bought a farm in Engenheiro Coelho to create the \"new IAE\". The São Paulo campus began to offer courses in the areas of Exact, Natural and Health Sciences, while the Engenheiro Coelho campus focused on the areas of Theology, Humanities and Technology. Between 1988 and 1989, new higher education courses were introduced, and between 1997 and 2007, they were expanded.\n\n\n=== Elevation to university center ===\nIn 1992, the institution considered the possibility of converting it into a university, but did not get a response from the National Education Council (CNE). Since then, the SDA leadership dedicated efforts to the project of a university center. On September 9, 1999, the Ministry of Education authorized the operation of the Centro Universitário Adventista de São Paulo (Adventist University Center of São Paulo - UNASP), which is maintained by the Seventh-day Adventist Network.\nIn 2002, the Seventh-day Adventist Network incorporated the Instituto Adventista São Paulo (Adventist Institute São Paulo - IASP), founded in 1949 in Hortolândia, which covered elementary and higher education through the Faculdade Adventista de Hortolândia (Adventist College of Hortolândia). UNASP was recognized by the National Council of Education (CNE) through Ordinance No. 1,655 of June 3, 2004. In 2018, UNASP was composed of the São Paulo, Engenheiro Coelho and Hortolândia campuses. \n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\n\n=== City of São Paulo ===\nIt offers courses in Administration, Systems Analysis and Development, Architecture and Urbanism, Computer Science, Accounting, Law, Physical Education, Nursing, Computer Engineering, Physiotherapy, Gastronomy, Nutrition, Pedagogy, Psychology, and Advertising.\n\n\n=== Hortolândia ===\nIt offers degrees in Administration, Accounting, Law, Physical Education, Nursing, Computer Engineering, Psychology, Advertising, and Information Systems.\n\n\n=== Engenheiro Coelho ===\nIt offers degrees in Administration, Architecture and Urbanism, Accounting, Law, Agronomic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Production Engineering, Journalism, Literature (English and Portuguese), Veterinary Medicine, Music, Pedagogy, Psychology, Advertising, Radio and TV, Theology, Translator, and Interpreter.\n\n\n== Teaching, research and extension ==\nUNASP has 55 courses, 36 of which are bachelor's degrees, 3 technologists and 16 undergraduate degrees. It also has 82 postgraduate courses, 80 of which are only lato sensu and two stricto sensu courses, which are aimed at professionalization. It has programs focused on Outpatient Nutrition Care, Care for the Elderly in Asylums, Children's Shelters, Adult Literacy, Digital Literacy for the Visually Impaired, and Digital Literacy for the Elderly. It also operates four primary and secondary education institutions that support the teaching of pedagogy and undergraduate degrees:\n\nColégio UNASP Artur Nogueira (UNASP Artur Nogueira School);\nColégio UNASP Engenheiro Coelho (UNASP Engenheiro Coelho School);\nColégio UNASP Hortolândia (UNASP Hortolândia School);\nColégio UNASP São Paulo (UNASP São Paulo School).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSeventh-day Adventist education\nUNASP São Paulo Memory Center\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 34 years of Left Front led Government in West Bengal during 1977-2011 refers to the consequently winning of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections and democratically forming Government for seven terms starting from 1977 to 2011 (34 years) in the Indian state of West Bengal. This period (1977–2011) is the longest serving of any democratically elected communists-led Government in the world. The \"34 years of Left Front rule in West Bengal\" is a well used political term coined by politicians in the West Bengal politics as well as politics of India.\nIt was started from 1977, when Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) won 1977 Assembly elections in Indian state of West Bengal with 2/3rd majority suppressing Janata Dal and Indian National Congress. Left Front of West Bengal included Communist Party of India (Marxist), All India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Marxist Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Communist Party of India and the Biplabi Bangla Congress, while  Communist Party of India, Socialist party joined in later years. Jyoti Basu was sworn in as Chief Minister of West Bengal after being elected from Satgachhia constituency. The Left Front ruled the state for seven consecutive terms 1977–2011, five with Jyoti Basu as Chief Minister and two under Buddhadev Bhattacharya. The rule ended in 2011, when All India Trinamool Congress historically defeated Left Front in 2011 Assembly elections.\n\n\n== Left Front and the politics of West Bengal ==\n\n\n=== Left Front ===\n\nThe Left Front (Bengali: বাম ফ্রন্ট; baam front) is an left-leaning alliance of left and communist political parties in of West Bengal. It was formed in January 1977, which subsequently won 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election in June 1977 and formed Government in the state. The alliance won every election after that up to 2011 and formed Governments for consequent 7 times.\nThe Left Front includes:\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist)\nCommunist Party of India\nAll India Forward Bloc\nRevolutionary Socialist Party\nRevolutionary Communist Party of India\nMarxist Forward Bloc\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n=== Major opposition parties ===\nJanata Dal\n\nIndian National Congress\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n\n=== Political controversies ===\n\n\n==== 1979 Marichjhanpi Massacre ====\n\nThe massacre in Marichjhanpi, which took place under CPI(M) rule in Bengal between January 26 and May 16, 1979, relates to the eviction of refugees from the reserved island of Marichjhanpi, Sunderbans, who had fled from East Pakistan thereby leading to the death of a sizable population among them.\n\nOut of the 14,388 families who deserted [for West Bengal], 10,260 families returned to their previous places … and the remaining 4,128 families perished in transit, died of starvation, exhaustion, and many were killed in Kashipur, Kumirmari, and Marichjhapi by police firings (Biswas 1982, 19).\nAfter leading the Left Front government for consecutive five terms, Jyoti Basu retired from active politics and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was appointed as his successor. In 2000, the Left Front came back to the power with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee again assuming the office of the Chief Minister.\nThe state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic reforms in India were introduced in the early 1990s by the central government, aided by election of a new reformist Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in 2000. About during 2007, armed activists, and Maoists have been organizing terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, while clashes with the administration have taken place at several sensitive places on the issue of industrial land acquisition.\n\n\n==== Singur Tata Nano controversy ====\n\nThe Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government wanted to set up a Tata Nano factory in Singur, Hooghly.Tata Motors started constructing a factory to manufacture a car, Tata Nano which was estimated to cost $2,500. The small cars were scheduled to roll out of the factory by 2008. Singur was chosen by the Tata Motors among six sites offered by the West Bengal state government. The project faced massive opposition from displaced farmers. The unwilling farmers were given political support by West Bengal's then-opposition leader Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee's \"Save Farmland\" movement was supported by civil rights and human rights groups, legal bodies, and social activists like Medha Patkar, Anuradha Talwar, Arundhati Roy and Magsaysay and Jnanpith Award-winning author Mahasweta Devi. Leftist activists also shared the platform with Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. The Tatas finally decided to move out of Singur on 3 October 2008. On 7 October 2008, the Tatas announced that they would be setting up the Tata Nano plant in Sanand in Gujarat after Ratan Tata received a call from the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi.\n\n\n==== Nandigram violence ====\n\nThe Nandigram violence was an incident in Nandigram, West Bengal where, under the orders of the Left Front government, more than 4,000 heavily armed police stormed the Nandigram area with the aim of stamping out protests against the West Bengal government's plans to expropriate 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based Salim Group. The area of Nandigram had turned into an internal-security threat for the country. The Trinamool Congress, collaborating with the Maoists, had isolated the entire area from the rest of the country, by cutting up all the roads and blocking them by tree trunks. Weapons were being collected and stored for an armed rebellion. The villagers were brainwashed against the Government and the progressive scheme. However, the shootings, in recent developments have proved to be a conspiracy of the TMC and Maoists alike. Indeed, the police had to resort to firing when the armed mob refused to disperse even after much persuasion and  tear gassing and started attacking the police. The then Chief Minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya was awarded a clean-chit for non-involvement in the Nandigram violence by the CBI. The police shot 13 villagers dead and one died from a very suspicious knife-attack, thus sparking controversies whether the police were, in the least, the ones to fire. At least 30 police officers were injured in the incident.\nThe SEZ controversy started when the government of West Bengal decided that the Salim Group of Indonesia would set up a chemical hub under the SEZ policy at Nandigram, a rural area in the district of Purba Medinipur. The villagers took over the administration of the area and all the roads to the villages were cut off.\n\n\n== Land reforms and agriculture ==\nLeft Front is considered for the most successful land reforms in India. While land reform had not made much headway in most of India, West Bengal has achieved many notable land reforms compared to it in fields like redistributing agricultural land ownership, regulating sharecropping relationships, and\ndistributing homestead plots.\n\n\n=== Operation Barga ===\n\nIn the first term of Left Front government, one of the main key priorities were land redistribution and the most effective was Operation Barga. Introduced in 1978, it was a comprehensive and radical measure for land reforms which was further formalised through two legislation in 1979 and 1980. The operation sough to actively identify and record bargardars (trans: sharecroppers) by present occupational status without any reliance on ancestral records, producing official documentation for enforcement of the rights of bargardars to crop share from landlords and priority rights to lands in cases of both voluntary sale of land and forced sale of ceiling surplus lands. The effects of Operation Barga included:\n\nThe number of recorded bargardars increased from 0.4 to 1.2 million by 1982, and resulted in the coverage of 50%+ output share concessions towards bargardars to increase from 10% to over 50% among registered bargardars and over 33% for unregistered bargardars.\nThe number of landless rural households decreased by 35% during this period.\nThrough Operation Barga, more than 1.39 million acres of land was acquired by the government and about 1.1 million acres of land was distributed among 2.54 million relatively land-poor households including 1.4 million share-croppers and 3.04 lakh poor peasants of the state. This counts about 8% of arable land and 34% of agricultural households. About 800,000 acres of land were distributed to 1.5 million heads of households between 1978 and 1982.\nBetween 1977 and 1980, the Government oversaw the identification of nearly 1 million acres of ceiling surplus land and its subsequent redistribution.\nThe implementation of the operation is noted to have improved the social status, dignity and prestige that was unheard of in the previous political regime. From 1978 to 1988 gram panchayats, the representation of bargadars, landless labourers and cultivators (with landholding of below 3 acres) increased from 1.8% to 11.3%, from 4.8% to 16.8% and from 21.8% to 30.17%. This also gave security and dicision making power to the poor and the bargadars.\nIn addition it accounted for approximately 36% of agricultural growth during the period as a consequence of greater production incentives due to a lack of eviction threat and increased output stake.\nThe operation is also credited to have created a cushion against farmers' suicides in West Bengal by improving the economic stability of farmers and decreasing economic inequality.\nWest Bengal accounted for 20% of total land redistribution in the country even though it accounts just 3.5% of total Indian land. Up to the year 2000, 1.6 million bargadars have been officially recorded as 86% of sharecroppers existing in the state. Also about a third of total cultivators in the state have been recorded as bargadars. Almost 9,00,000 bargadars were recorded between 1978 and 1988. But between 1988 and 1997 the process slowed down coming to less than 90,000 bargadars. As of September 1999, nearly 296,000, households had benefited by receiving homestead.\n\n\n=== Patta land ===\nOne of further successful land redistribution was done by pattas. Land has been redistributed among 2.745 million ‘pattadars’. Barga and patta both had covered 41.3% of the rural population of West Bengal. The state alone accounted for 47% of all India beneficiaries. Between 1993 and 1999 around 95,000 acres were given to pattadars. 6.25 lakh joint patta and 1.65 lakh female patta have been distributed.\n\n\n=== Major land reforms, acts and timeline ===\nThere were numerous acts with a number of significant amendments from the LF Government. Some of them are,\n\nWest Bengal Town and Country (Planning & Development) Act, 1979\nWest Bengal Land Reform (Amendment) Act 1981\nThe West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984 \nWest Bengal Thika Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 2001\nEast Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act, 2006\nIn 1990s, the land reforms process slowed down. Those who were given land or cultivation rights through land reforms could not hold it because of rising input prices and falling output prices (see Agriculture, 1990s) resulting difficulty in cultivation. As a result, 13.23% of pattadars and 14.37% of bargadars gave up their cultivation rights or had lost their land. The number of landless rural households was also increasing throughout the 1990s, i.e. from 39.6% in 1987–88 to 41.6% in 1999–2000. Small cultivators faced more land loss specially in regions where large-scale operation was the most profitable. In 1999–2000, rural-urban inequality increased more precisely. The village consumption per capita was 52% of per capita urban consumption in West Bengal compared to 56% as of all India and nearly 80% of agriculturally advanced states like Punjab, Haryana.\n\nIrrigated area expanded from 32% to about 70% from 1977 to 2006. Up to 2006, Scheduled Caste beneficiaries in West Bengal were 1.04 million (49.5% of all India) and Scheduled Tribe beneficiaries in West Bengal were 0.53 million (62% of All India).\nUp to 2011, homestead land has been distributed to over 3.24 lakh landless labourers. In the 7th term (2006–2011), Left Front government brought land from willing farmers at a price 25% higher than the market price and redistributed them. 739.37 acres of land were purchased and redistributed to 5476 poor and landless families in the rural areas.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\n\n==== 1977-1990 ====\nIn the earlier terms of LF Government, agricultural production, grew at a spectacular rate, specially in the 1980s. West Bengal emerged as the largest rice producing state in India contributing more than 15 per cent of national production. The agricultural growth jumped from an annual average of 0.6% between 1970–1980 to over 7% between 1980 and 1990. In the 80s, West Bengal moved from being a food importer to a food exporter and became the largest producer of rice outstripping the states of Andhra Pradesh and Punjab which had previously held the status.\nDuring the 1980s, overall foodgrains had a growth rate of 5.81%, which was only 0.96% in 1979.\n\n\n==== Boro cultivation ====\nLeft Front introduced high yielding boro rice cultivation. Boro was an extremely labour-intensive form of rice cultivation carried on by small cultivators in small plots of land using mainly family labour. Due to land reforms and Operations Barga, Boro cultivation was successful among farmers. This gave advantage to the farmers by raising more than one crop in a given year. Also the requisite water for boro cultivation was available from minor irrigations like shallow tube well. During the 1980s boro cultivation grew at an average annual rate of 12 per cent. Total factor productivity growth for the period was more rapid in West Bengal (3.93% annually) than in any other major Indian state.\n\n\n==== 1990-2009 ====\nThe agricultural growth significantly slowed down in the 1990s due to a number of reasons. Boro cultivation could not be expanded due to unavailability of water and stopped. Demand and productivity both did not increased and West Bengal failed to export its rice to other states and abroad due to poor marketing strategies. Foodgrains input prices increased but the profit was less. Growthrate of foodgrain decreased to 2.13% in 1994. As a result, the percentage of cultivators in the rural workforce in 1991 fell from 38% in 1991 to 25.4% in 2001. At the same time, growth of boro cultivation slowed down to 5 per cent. The overall agricultural growth became around 2% in the 1990s.\nDespite overall agricultural slowdown in 1990s, 2000s were more competitively more better. During the 7th LF government, agriculture has grown at 3.1% in West Bengal from 2006–07 to 2009–10, compared to only 2.1% at the national level. West Bengal produced 14.3 million tons of rice in 2009–10, which was the highest for any state in the country, accounting for 16% of all-India production.\n\nIn 2006, the index of cropping intensity in West Bengal was 180, the second highest in India. The area under high yielding seeds increased from 28% to 96%. About 83% of the gross cropped area consisted different types of high yielding crops.  West Bengal became also the first among all states in the production of vegetables (12.8 million tons in 2009–10). The LF government spent Rs. 400 crore to procure potatoes at an assured price of Rs. 3.50 per kg to prevent the losses of potato growers.\n\n\n== Political reforms ==\n\n\n=== Panchayat raj ===\n\"Democratic decentralisation\" of rural power have been the one of the most prominent achievements of the Left Front in West Bengal. Left Front and Jyoti Basu are credited to have been successful in the introduction of grassroots democracy and self governing units in West Bengal which substantially improved bureaucratic transparency, irrigation work, rural infrastructure and political participation and as a result standards of living.\nThe Left Front government amended and implemented the provisions of the Panchayat Act. On 4 June 1978, local body elections were resumed after 14 years and the first direct elections were held to elect 56,000 representatives from 15 zila parishads, 324 panchayat samitis and 3,242 gram panchayats in West Bengal. On 4 June 1978 three-tier panchayat local bodies were elected across the state, by elections in which the Left Front won a landslide victory. By 1993, the number of representatives was expanded to over 71,000 representatives.\nOther efforts of taken during successive Left Front Governments was:\n\nWoman reservation was extended up to 50% from 33%.\nAround 35% of Government expanditure was done through the three-tier panchayat system.\nThe Gram Sangsad was formed in 1992 to ensure people's participation in the panchayat system.\nPanchayat system helped to extend the rural infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Other political developments ===\nSeeing distribution of central government funds as unjust and politicized, the Left Front government began measures to pressure the central government to change its approach towards the state governments. These movements eventually resulted in the Sarkaria Commission.\nThe Left Front government was also credited with coping with the refugee situation created by the Bangladesh Liberation War and severe floods.\n\n\n== Industry ==\n\n\n=== Overall ===\nWest Bengal had it's major industries in Kolkata, Durgapur, Howrah, Hooghly, Bakreshwar and the mineral-rich western highlands. From 1977, Left Front's industrial policy focused on small companies and thus bigger industries suffered until 1994 when again an industrial policy was announced but based on economic liberalization. This policy revamped the major industries in 2000s.\n\n\n=== 1977-1993 ===\n\nAfter coming to power, the Left Front government announced industrial policy of in 1978 which gave high priority to small scale Industries and cottage industries to generate employment in industry and curtailed the monopoly power of big business companies, specially the multi-nationals in the organized sector. The Government declared than no new investment by multi-nationals would be allowed in the state. For an industrial rejuvenation in the state, LF government came up with a four-point demand from the center: \"(i) more licenses should be granted for investment in the private sector in the state; (ii) government investment in the public sector should be increased; (iii) fund allocated for development in the state should be increased; and (iv) a host of regulations hindering establishment of new industries in the state should be relaxed\". Jyoti Basu even made efforts to mobilize non-Congress chief ministers from a number of other states, to put collective pressure on the government at the center, but with no success.\nIn this period, industrial parameters steadily grew down. But Left's industrial policies was not the only cause of this industrial downfall. The other major causes for industries growing down in this period were:\n\nUntil 1990, state's major industrial control was under the Central Government. States where the political party in Government was aligned with the central government took the maximum benefit of this pro-business attitudinal change. West Bengal having non-aligned LF Government did not much importance and big industries were started to be taken away to other states. The contradicting Congress-led central government at that time delayed new projects in the state like the for the clearance of making thermal power plant in Bakreshwar, the state had to wait seven years fue to procrastination at the center. West Bengal got a “relief from centre’s control” after the economic reforms of 1991. By 1991, the economy had suffered major losses due to issues beyond the state's control.\nIndustrialists did not show interest in starting new business in the state because of the militant trade unionism in the industry, which was primarily supported by the 1960s United Front government. There were 894 instances in 1969 and 340 instances in 1971 of work stoppage due to industrial disputes. In 1977 there were 397 instances of work stoppage happened in which 206 were strikes and the remaining 191 were lockouts. In the successive Governments Left Front government stopped supporting militant labor movements. It began to promote bilateral negotiations between labor and the management avoiding confrontation. Following the years the total number of major industrial disputes came down to 208 (78 strikes and 130 lockouts) in 1980 and 213 (21 strikes, 192 lockouts) in 1991. Though numerous factories suffered for this and have either closed down or have laid off a large number of workers.\nDuring the 1980s due to the central Government, massive retrenchment of labor happened in organized industry all across the country in which West Bengal lost 177,000 in the 80s but created only 91,000 new jobs after the reform in 90s.\nProduction cost was higher than other states.\n\nAnother cause was managerial incompetence. Companies like Kesoram Cotton Mills and Metal Box, Hind Motors have closed for this reason.\nDue to Central Government's freight equalisation scheme coal and other natural resources were carried at equivalent prices across the country. Many industries were shifted out to other parts of India from West Bengal.\n\nIn many cases, experienced displaced workers started their own factories in small sheds. These small entrepreneurs have emerged as sub-contractors of bigger factories from which they had been laid off. As a result, numerous small industrial establishments came in the unorganized sector. This led to the solution of employment problem but overall the economic condition of industrial workers became deteriorated. \nIn the 1990s, West Bengal had turned into a small-scale, production-dominated economical state, most of these units were unregistered. The share of unregistered manufacturing in the manufacturing state domestic product (SDP) of the state almost gone to 60% in 1990s from an average of 30% in the 1980s.  89.2% of total industrial employment was generated by the small scale industries compared to Gujarat, Maharashtra and all India who stood at 70.07%, 67.3% and 81.12%. The number of informal sector manufacturing units also increased, specially in the rural areas. Most of them did not have any well-defined property live on illegally encroached government or railway land or pavements of city streets to sell their ware. But due to poor quality, untimely delivery and sales services the local and small scale industries never grow or compete at the national level. Though in 1981–87, growth rate of manufacturing was below 2 per cent, it grew to above 3 per cent during 1987–94. Jessop & Company, Braithwaite, Burn & Company, Indian Standard Wagon, GKW (then Guest Keen Williams) and Metal Box were some companies who were very much affected. Workers were paid only minimum wages.\nIn 1978 while amounts of per capita industrial investment in private sector were ₹670 for all-India, and ₹428 in West Bengal, in 1994 the figures stood at ₹9,177 for all-India, and ₹4,376 in West Bengal, compared to ₹22,776 in Gujarat, ₹12,385 in Maharashtra. Though new companies were created at this period like Shree Cement (1979), Balrampur Chini Mills (1979), Orient Cement (1979), Skiper Limited (1981), Century Plyboard (1982), Kolpona Industries (1985), Haldia Petrochemicals(1985), Himadri Chemical And Industry (1987), Magma Finkorp (1988), Tata Metalics (1990) etc.\n\nThough, the employment problem was solved due to both of the organised and unorganised sectors.\n\nThe per capita net state domestic product (NSDP) declined to 7th in 1990-91 having 6th in 1980–81.\n\n\n=== 1994-2000 ===\nIn 1994 the LF government announced a new industrial policy based on economic liberalization. In the new industrial policy, the LF Government declared that it would welcome foreign multi-national investment and technology. Priority was given to both public and private investment (domestic and foreign) in industry. Private investment was to be allowed in the power sector, in some important sectors within manufacturing projects were to be launched as public-private joint ventures. Improvement and upgrading of industrial infrastructure would be indispensable. The government had also given special attention to \"petrochemicals and downstream industries, electronics and information technology, iron, steel, metallurgical and engineering, textiles, leather and leather products, food processing, medicinal plants, rubber, palm oil and tea, manufacture of basic drugs, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, minerals and mine based industries, gems, jewellery and promotion of tourism and tourism related activities\". The Left Front government made a deliberate effort to project itself as a ‘business friendly’ Government. The new industrial policy of 1994 was acclaimed as much pro-industry and it was more practically implemented and turned more favourable towards industrialisation during Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's chief ministerial rule.\nIn this period many major industrial changes took place. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation was established. Promotional campaigns were undertaken in collaboration with various Chambers of Commerce and industries. Mitsubishi and Chatterjee Soros Fund Management from abroad and Tata Group within the country collaborated with the state in a  public-private joint venture at the Haldia Petro Chemical Project successfully. In 1991–2001, ₹197752.0 million were implemented in industrial projects.\nAfter 1991, the Central Government gave much control to the state government. After 1991, industries which are exempt from industrial licensing, had to file an Industrial Entrepreneur Memoranda (IEM) with Secretariat of Industrial Approvals (SIA). Between  August 1991 and October 2006, 3844 IEMs are proposed with an investment amount of ₹85,968 Crores, in which 475 IEMs were really implemented with an investment amount of ₹28,963 Crores. West Bengal did competitively better implemention than other states. But despite the industrial policies, West Bengal only attracted only 4.73% of all applications for investment in the private sector in the period of 1991 to 2003, the share of proposed \ninvestment was even lower at 3.85%, in which 35.4% of the planned investment was actually implemented, compared to Maharashtra and Gujarat which attracted one third of the whole investment and 55% was implemented in Gujarat. Over the period August 1991- January 2003, per capita investment in the private sector was ₹1952 in West Bengal compared to ₹20,725 in Gujarat.\nAgain one of the main causes of no industries coming to state was militant unionism, which was still higher than other states. Also production cost per ₹1000 of gross output was still much higher, which was ₹883 in 1994-1995 compared to Gujrat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu having ₹818, ₹820 and ₹827 as costs.\n\nThe manufacturing growth started to increase in the 1990s and stood at 6.75% compared to 4.24% in the 1980s, which is the second highest growth rate in the 1990s, only next to Karnataka.\n\n\n=== Industrialisation drive in 2000s ===\nThe economic decline stopped in 2000–2001. After 2003, industries in the state started to come up in much higher pace and West Bengal became rapidly competitive with Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The state saw a re-emergence of manufacturing sector that was declining through the 80s and 90s. West Bengal only accounted 3.8 per cent of the total number of industrial appeals implemented in India in 1992-1999 which increased to 12.2 per cent in 2000-2004 due to new scheme of incentives announced in 2000, replacing the old schemes of 1993 and 1999. About 24 lakhs jobs were created during 2005–2011, in West Bengal, highest in India at that time, while Gujarat only created 14.9 lakh jobs. West Bengal had 12% industrial growth, highest in \nIndia at that time. The credit of the mass industrial shift was mostly gone to the then Industry minister Nirupam Sen and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.\nIn 2006, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced, the government has ensured industrial investment of Rs 6,000 crore for 2006. Before that in 2002-2005 ₹86400.5 million industrial projects were iimplemented. Between 2006 and 2010, over Rs. 36000 crore was spent to materialize 1313 large and medium industrial units. Production cost per Rs.1000 of gross output came down to ₹794, compared to Gujrat which was at ₹810. \n\nThe industrial drive resulted:\n\nThe industrialization drive created direct employment opportunities for 1.41 lakh people. 322 units were materialized in 2010, 80% of which were medium scale enterprises.\nEmployment at the IT sector expanded from 32000 in 2006 to 105000 in 2010.\nThe number of new small-scale units in the state has increased from 19884 in 2010 to 23000 in 2011 making employment opportunities for 2.2 lakh persons.\nThe state saw about Rs 5,000 crore worth of FDI per year, the third highest after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.\nLeft Front Government ensured investment of Rs 10 billion for the modernisation of IISCO steel plant. The sevent LF Government aimed revival of Bengal Chemicals, Gluconate, Infusion India, as well as the fertilizer industry and the Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation. In addition to this, many big industrialization projects were planned and many were executed, though some of them were pulled off. Some of the notable are:\n\nJapanese company Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation built purified terephthalic acid (PTA) PTA plant at Haldia in April 2000, with an investment of 1475 crore, which was the single-largest Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) then. In 2006, the plant doubled its production capacity last year, with more investment of Rs 1,450 crore. In 2005, MCC also decided to invest Rs 1,665 crore for setting up another PTA plant in West Bengal. The two plants would slated to produce 12.7 million tonnes of main raw material for polyester annually.\nTata group started ₹1 lakh small cars project. The project started executing but resulted pulling out  due to Tata Nano Singur controversy.\nThe LF Government had an agreement with Indonesia's largest conglomerate Salim Group in 2006, after chiefs minister's visit to Indonesia in 2005. The Salim Group-promoted New Kolkata International Development Pvt Ltd agreed to build a multi-product and chemical lab on an area of about 9,000 hectares in Nandigram SEZ with an investment of Rs 48,000 crore, which is largest investment project in the state ever. The project was not successful due to mass protests followed by Nandigram violence and Maoist insurgency.\nThe consumer electronics and home appliances gaint Videocon group had decided to invest to create IT and bio-tech special economic zone (SEZ) in Siliguri as a joint venture with a Thailand-based firm.  LF Government allocated 100 acres plot for the SEZ project.\nJindal Steel agreed to invest ₹35,000 crore  in coal-mining and making steel plants and power generating units. Though the project was drafted in February 2007, the project was planned in a 4500-acre area of Shalboni, which was a Maoist-operated area. Due to Maoist insurgency in that area and global economic meltdown, the project got holded up to March 2010.\nIn October 2007, Videocon group decided to invest 15,000-20,000 crore to make 3-million tone steel plant and 12000 MW thermal power plant at Jamuria over a land of 1,800 to 2,000 acres.\nThough, after the change of the Government in 2011, many industrial projects stopped and were pulled of. Videocon pulled off its Jalpaiguri SEZ project in 2012 stating \"latest business outlook of the region\" as a cause. Videocon's steel plant and power plant project was also pulled off in 2013 due to problems regarding to coal linkage and Government's interdiction in land acquisition for industrial projects.\n\n\n== Economy, poverty and employment ==\n\nThe state was primarily dependent on agriculture and industry. In 2006, the GDP of the state (at $23 billion or Rs 2,300 crore) standed as the third highest in the country. The per capita growth is second only to Karnataka at 5.4 per cent. West Bengal also has the second highest compounded average growth rate in the country-5.49 per cent against a national average of 4.41 per cent. During the last LF Government, the state's OTR to GSDP share was between 4.22%-4.59% which, according to this CAG report, was “lower than the target of 6.8 percent recommended by the 12th Finance Commission”. The state's gross fiscal deficit as a percentage of the GSDP was 4.2% in 2010–11. The GSDP growth rate at 2011-12 was 4.17 percent. In the 2010–11, during the 7th LF Government, Bengal's debt-GDSP ratio stood at its peak in 2010–11 at 41.9 percent, as per IIM Calcutta conducted survey, which was the highest in the country. According to the ranking of states’ per capita income at current prices, West Bengal's rank was 15th in 2011. Bengal's revenue deficit as a percentage of the GSDP was 3.75 percent in 2010–11. Debt to revenue receipt ratio came down to 396.47 percent in 2010–11. The share of social service sector expenditure in the state's total expenditure was 9.8 percent in 2010–11. Share of capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure was 3.61 percent in 2010–11. West Bengal stood below the national average with respect to per capita consumption, housing, electrification, per capita consumption of electricity and poverty. In 1980-81 per capita income of West Bengal was 51 per cent of that of Kolkata, in 2000-01 it has gone down to 48.3 per cent. West Bengal State Domestic Product consisted of 31% in Agriculture, 4% in Fishery, 4% in Const, 26% in Services, 14% in Manufacturing, 14% in Trade and business and 7% in others. The share of the primary sector in the State Domestic Product declined from 32.9 per cent in 1999–2000 to 26.9 per cent in 2005–06. The share of the secondary sector increased from 14.8 per cent to 16.9 per cent. The share of the tertiary sector grew from 52.3 per cent to 56.2 per cent. This showed a shift from agriculture and rural manufacturing to low-quality employment in urban and rural areas. From 1999 to 2005, the annual rate of growth (%)  of employment was 3.63 in agriculture, 2.72 in Mining and quarrying, 1.53 in Manufacturing, -9.22 in electricity and water, 9.75 in construction, 3.6 in Trade, hotels and\nrestaurants, 3.63 in transport and 3.3 in labour force.\nIn 2001, West Bengal was a population of 80.2 million and a population density of 904 persons per square kilometer and the most densely populated. Agriculture is the mainstay for the majority of the population, comprises the largest sector of the economy, and utilizes the great majority of the state's land. Seventy-two percent of the states’ population lives in rural areas and 53% of the labor force is engaged in agricultural production. Agriculture generates 31% of the state domestic product.\nThe quintile distribution of rural per capita income in West Bengal  in 1993-94 was lower than the all India level. In 1997-1998 state's total debt/GSDP was 22.97.\n\nPoverty in West Bengal decreased heavily during the Left Front rule. The decreasing was the largest after Kerala.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nDuring the premitive Left Front tenures, the physical infrastructure downgraded. West Bengal ranked 8th in 1970–71, 9th in 1980-81 and 17 in 1990-91 which was only ahead of one state Assam.\n\n\n=== Power and electricity ===\nIn the 90s, West Bengal was below the national average with respect to per capita consumption, housing, electrification, per capita consumption of electricity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe literacy rate in West Bengal jumped from 38% in 1977 to 68% in 2001 and 74% in 2011. 14 new universities, more than 200 new degree colleges and engineering colleges (while 5 new universities, 73 new degree colleges and 36 new engineering colleges were established under the 7th LF government) were established throughout LF successive governments. Net enrolment ratio in primary education reached 98.95% in 2009–10. Drop-out rate declined to 8.66% in 2009-10 which was below national average.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nDuring the successive LF Governments, parameters of healthcare differed and were average in results. After 1977, LF tried to initiate the Chinese barefoot doctor model in the state. But, the project met with resistance and had to be abandoned. Then they tried to build a three-tier health service system for the rural areas. The doctors would be placed in the primary, subsidiary and the sub-divisional or district hospitals and the state-run medical college hospitals would act as referral hospitals. Budgets were allocated and some sort of infrastructure was built up. But, the LF government failed to post doctors in the rural areas.  Overall, the heathcare saw a degradation, until 1987, when CPI(M) leader Prasanta Sur took office as health minister and reformed the ministry. Before that there had been several cases of death and mutilation of new born babies by dogs and cats. Basic services are not available in most rural hospitals for want of doctors. According to state government figures, of the 40,000 registered medical practitioners, 69% are located in urban areas though 73% of the population lives in rural areas. Even the drug control administration was in shambles. Licence were issued to unscientific and banned drugs. According to Jana Swap, the joint secretary of the Health Services Association, numerous drug companies dealed with the doctors' unions which are affiliated to the party and resulted uninterrupted trade of unscientific, irrational and even banned drug formulations in pharmaceutical markets.\nThere were some notable achievements during LF term in healthcare:\n\nAt the end of 2009, 73% of all patients in West Bengal undergo treatment from the public health system, compared to national average of 40%.\nThe decline in infant mortality rate in West Bengal was the second fastest in the country.\nThe 7th LF government created health insurance schemes, benefiting 25 lakh workers in the unorganized sector from 56 categories and professions.\n\n\n== Other indexes ==\nThe Human Development Index was noted to have improved at a much faster rate than in other states, growing from being the lowest in the country in 1975 to above the national average in 1990.\nThe death rate in West Bengal stood at 6.2 in 2009, which was the lowest among all states in the country.\nAnnual population growth rate in West Bengal reduced from 1.77% between 1991–2001 to 1.39% between 2001 and 2011, which was the fourth lowest in the country at that time. Child sex ratio in West Bengal at 950 in 2011 was the second highest in the country.\nFood subsidy was increased by Rs. 434 crore to provide cheap rice to the poor.\nLF Government started supplying rice at Rs. 2 per kg from March 2009 and provided rice to  2.65 crore poor in the state. Rice offtake from the ration shops increased  to 96% in 2011. Sugar, edible oil and pulses were also been supplied through the PDS at prices 10% lower than market prices during the festival time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute or the Patagonia Question was the boundary dispute between Argentina and Chile during the 19th century for the possession of the southernmost territories of South America on the basis of disagreements over the boundaries corresponding to the uti possidetis juris inherited from the Spanish Empire.\nThe extensive territory corresponds to approximately one million two hundred km², which represent 45% of the current surface of Argentina, all of the center and south of that country, and which, according to Chilean historiography, would have implied a loss for Chile of two-thirds of its nominal territory de jure.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Of occupation by the Spanish Empire ===\n\n\n==== Strait of Magellan and surrounding territories ====\n\nDuring the 16th-century Spanish explorers and conquerors attempt to found settlements in the Strait of Magellan, Pedro de Valdivia proposed the extension of the governorship of Chile to the strait, which was granted, and prior to this, he continued his expeditions in a southerly direction to found a settlement in the place, something that did not materialize when he encountered the araucanos.\nIn addition, other Spaniards during that century founded settlements in Primera Angostura, Ciudad Nombre de Jesús and Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe, later known as the port of Hunger due to the death of its inhabitants from food shortages, having planted seeds in the opposite seasons (not knowing that of the southern hemisphere).\nDuring the 16th century the Captaincy General of Chile sought to implement a policy of southern territorial integration to connect Santiago to the Strait of Magellan. There was agreement on the \"road to the Strait\" project and the policy of founding towns in the south, in addition to the construction of roads for the structuring of the kingdom (Santiago-Concepción, Concepción-Valdivia, Castro-Ancud, Castro-Nahuelhuapi, Chiloé-Valdivia).\n\n\n==== Expedition of Juan Ladrillero ====\n\nThe Viceroy of Peru, Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza, aware of Juan Ladrillero's seafaring skills and expertise, and although he was already of advanced age, chose him to accompany his son García Hurtado de Mendoza who would leave for the Kingdom of Chile as governor, and who had as one of his tasks to recognize the western mouth of the Strait of Magellan, which had been ordered by a Royal Decree. The squadron composed of three ships and a galleon set sail from El Callao on February 2, 1557, arrived at Coquimbo and continued its navigation towards the south in demand of Quiriquina Island and then headed to Valdivia to enlist the ships with which it would carry out the reconnaissance of the Strait. Two ships of 50 barrels each and manned by 60 men were enlisted. The ship San Luis was commanded by Juan Ladrillero himself and the other, the San Sebastián, was placed under the command of Francisco Cortés Ojea. It left the city of Valdivia, on Wednesday, November 17, 1557, with Juan Ladrillero as captain and assisted by Captain Francisco Cortés Ojea.\nHe armed two ships of 450 barrels each and manned by 60 men. Ladrillero took command of the San Luis with Hernán Gallego as pilot and Cortés Ojea commanded the San Sebastián with Pedro Gallego as pilot. They sailed from Valdivia on November 17, 1557, calling at the Golfo de Penas, to which he named the Alcachofado inlet, they entered the Patagonian channels through the Fallos channel, at the exit of which the ships separated and did not meet again.\nCortés Ojea sailed for two months the existing channels between Wellington Island and the Strait of Magellan, in the Golfo Trinidad he dismantled the San Sebastián and with its remains built a small brigantine which he christened San Salvador returning to the north and anchoring in Valdivia on October 1, 1558.\nLadrillero entered the channels through the West Channel He returned to the north through the Wide Channel, the Indian Pass and the English Narrows, and when he reached the Gulf of Penas, he returned south again via the Pacific Ocean.\nHe reconnoitered the southern coast of Concepción Channel and entered the channels through Nelson Strait and discovered the region of Última Esperanza Province, navigated the Kirke Channel and explored Obstruction Seno, initially believing that he had reached the Strait of Magellan.\nHe returned to the Pacific looking for the entrance to the Strait, but this time he continued south, recognizing the Desolación Island, he entered the Strait navigating surely the Abra Channel. At Cape Possession, where he arrived on August 9, 1558, he performed the ceremony of taking possession of it. After exploring the eastern mouth, it returned to the north, enduring all kinds of calamities, lack of food and death of its crew members, managing to land in the Bahía de Concepción where it anchored with only the captain, a sailor and a black servant, who died a few days later, except Ladrillero who died in mid-1574.\n\n\n==== Nahuelhuapi Province and explorations in the interior of Eastern Patagonia ====\n\nDuring the Hispanic period there were numerous expeditions to the Magellanic lands as part of the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Chile, crossing the mountain ranges of Valdivia and Chiloé seeking the subjugation and evangelization of the Puelche, Poyas and Tehuelche Indians of Eastern Patagonia and the search for the mythical City of the Caesars. Thanks to the missionaries Nicolás Mascardi, Van der Meeren (Laguna), Zúñiga, Guglielmo and Elguea, the Todos los Santos Lake, the Vuriloche Pass and the Nahuelhuapi Lake, where there was a Catholic temple, were discovered. Father Mascardi spent four years as a missionary among the indigenous people of the area, who were not only Poyas, but also Pehuenches and Puelches. At that time, the process of Araucanization of these peoples had not yet begun.\nDuring those years he undertook three explorations to the south and east, in search of the City of the Caesars. There is not much data on the regions he would have visited. The most optimistic authors consider him to have reached the Santa Cruz River or Puerto San Julián, passing through Musters Lake. Other authors, more moderate, suppose that he would have explored only certain places in the northwest of the current province of Chubut. In all these explorations he was accompanied by native guides. But, once he tried to return briefly to Old Chile, the guides refused to lead him to that destination, so as not to be deprived of his presence.\nThe last of his explorations was carried out in 1673, up to the vicinity of a lake that has not been specified. In that place, perhaps in the month of September, he was attacked by a rival Tehuelche partiality of the Poyas, and killed by blows of boleadora|boleadora and arrows. The guides who accompanied him managed to bury him and fled; to return two years later, guiding Spanish explorers who rescued his corpse and some religious ornaments.\nThe Captaincy General of Chile continued sending expeditions to the area, even after the death of Mascardi in the area of the Deseado River. Legally, the area around Nahuelhuapi was considered part of the Kingdom of Chile and was considered part of the section of the future road to the Strait of Magellan.\n\nOn June 12, 1764, the governor of Chile Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga, issued a decree referring to the religious missions with the intention that in the years in which entry into the Strait of Magellan and the nations that inhabit it would be made, provided that no entry was made without the express license of that superior Government\nThe Franciscan missionary Fray Francisco Menéndez, in 1783 explored the mountain range of the province of Chiloé, and from 1791 made trips to the Nahuelhuapi province, continuing with the missions started by the Jesuits in the previous century.\nIn addition, the construction of the Castro-Nahuelhuapi road was contemplated from the Kingdom of Chile.\n\n\n==== Atlantic coast of Patagonia ====\n\nIn 1768, Captain General Ambrosio O'Higgins, sent a letter to the Council of the Indies urgently requesting authorization to found settlements on the Patagonian Atlantic coast to take possession of the area and prevent foreign nations such as Great Britain from advancing, textually \"attending to the internal defense of the Kingdom\".\n\nThe following year the letter was presented at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Indies in Madrid in which the attorney general expressed: Don Ambrosio O'Higgins sends a presentation, his date in Santiago de Chile on July 7, 1769, accompanied by some notes on the current state of that Kingdom, missions and populations of the frontier, with reflections on the possibility and precision of extending them both along the East and West Coast of Cape Horn and Magellanic Lands, as well as the Pampas of Buenos Aires\n\nThe recommendations of Ambrosio O'Higgins on the foundation of establishments in Atlantic Patagonia were listened to and put into practice by King Carlos III of Spain who commissioned the viceroys of Buenos Aires, from 1778 onwards, the foundation of these on the said coasts, arranging that they would depend accidentally on the viceroyalty for reasons of proximity, without this altering the political jurisdiction of the Atlantic Patagonian coast, making it explicit as part of the kingdom of Chile in the royal decree of June 8, 1778.\n\nIn order that the English ... do not think of establishing themselves in San Julián Bay or on the same coast for whaling in those seas ... it has been resolved by His Majesty. that reserved and very precise orders be given to the Viceroy of Buenos Aires and also to the Intendant of the Royal Treasury that ... 'with all promptness he will arrange for a formal establishment and population in said San Julian Bay. ... ...The first is the Bahía Sin Fondo or Punta de San Matías in which the Río Negro which flows for about three hundred leagues into the Kingdom of Chile drains, and this circumstance makes its occupation more precise and that a provisional fort be erected there. ... that the commissioner of Bahía Sin Fondo make the most exact reconnaissance of the immediate country, trying to take from them all the possible advantage for the solidity and increase of that establishment extending his explorations to the internal lands, he will try to direct them by sea as the first object, towards the mouth of the Colorado River or of the Barrancas, which also goes towards the Kingdom of Chile, and is located about twenty leagues north of the Negro River that forms the port of the Bahía Sin Fondo.\nTo alter altering this jurisdiction, the sovereign created a new job for those who would direct the new settlements, that of commissioner-superintendent, reserving for himself the power to appoint them and not to the viceroys.\n\n\n==== Parliaments with the indigenous people of the region ====\n\nIn addition Ambrosio O'Higgins sought the incorporation of the Indians pampas, present in Eastern Patagonia who participated in the parliaments held between 1771 and 1793 and convened by Ambrosio and later ones such as the Parliament of Negrete of 1803 held with the \"Indians of Chile\" and which reaffirms the prohibition of incursions on the Pampa south of Buenos Aires, where these mentioned indigenous tribes inhabited.\nIn 1793, Governor O'Higgins, held the Parliament of Negrete in which he sought to parley with indigenous tribes on both sides of the Andes, including the Patagonian pampas, considering them part of the kingdom. Ambrosio proposed to build a road between the southern part of old Chile and Buenos Aires to promote trade between these domains and also to further incorporate the Pampas Indians.\n\n\n==== Territories east of the mountain range in the Talca area ====\nIn 1736, the intendant of Concepción, on behalf of the judge of vacant lands of the audience of Santiago, ordered the judges of the party of Maule, to put in possession to a Mr. Jiron, of some colts located in the eastern foothills of the Andes, bordering the province of Talca.\n\n\n=== Legal ===\n\nIn 1534, Emperor Charles V divided part of the South American territory into three governorships: \n\nNew Castile for Francisco Pizarro,\nNew Toledo for Diego de Almagro and Diego de Almagro and Diego de Almagro for Diego de Almagro.\nNew León or Magellanic Lands for Simón de Alcazaba y Sotomayor, which was later extended to the Strait of Magellan.\nIn 1539, a new governorship was created to the south of Nueva León called Governorate of Terra Australis for Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz. In 1554, the conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, who was already in charge of the Governorship of Chile, got the Council of the Indies to transfer the rights of Nueva León and Terra Australis to Jerónimo de Alderete, who, after Valdivia's death the following year, took over as governor and annexed them to the territory of the kingdom of Chile.\n\nJerónimo de Alderete succeeded in his task at the Court by obtaining the territories south of the strait for himself, asking for the territories immediately south of the Strait of Magellan while Valdivia's death was not yet known. Alderete's request covered from the said Strait of Magellan along the coast of the southern sea onwards up to three hundred leagues, with all that the said strait lasts it is estimated that Valdivia authorized Alderete to make this request.\nThe monarchs granted the extension of the governorship of Valdivia to the Strait of Magellan in and Alderete's request in two royal decrees of September 29, 1554, in the one referring to the southern territory reads: It has seemed to us to grant as we hereby grant the said Captain Geronimo de Alderete the governorship of the land that as the said strait is on the other side of the said Strait of Magellan. After this, the Council of the Indies would draw the limits of the portion of the Terra Australis granted to Alderete, complementing by means of a capitulation the details in question.\nHowever, the news of the death of Pedro de Valdivia reached the Iberian Peninsula and with this Alderete inherited all the territory of the governorship of Terra Australis (not only the one he asked for) and on May 29, 1555, he obtained by another royal decree the provinces of Chile, its Patagonian territories, as well as incorporating the territories of Terra Australis to the kingdom of Chile. of which he was also appointed governor. In this charter he is asked to: Take possesion in our name of the lands and provinces that fall in the demarcation of the Crown of Castile, on the other side of the said strait.\nAt the end of 1554 King Carlos I sends a letter to the Council of the Indies expressing: and in what touches to the land that is on the other side of the said Strait of Magellan that likewise we have given and granted in governorship to the said Geronimo de Alderete we have ordered him for the reasons that have been written to you that he can from the said province of Chile send some ships to take news and relation of the quality and utility of that land because for the present he has not to pass in person nor go to conquer it nor to populate it because at present having to attend to what of Chile, could not be done one and the other together.\nIn the period of eight months between September 1554 and May 1555 the regions of Terra Australis requested by Alderete near the Strait of Magellan were in charge of a ruler different from that of Chile, to later be definitively incorporated to the latter once Alderete is named governor of Chile. On April 7, 1556, during his return trip, he died in Panamá of yellow fever.\n\nSubsequently, in 1558, the Royal Decree of Brussels prompted the Chilean kingdom to take possession in our name of the lands and provinces that fall within the demarcation of the crown of Castile, in reference to the lands on the other side of the Strait since at that time Tierra del Fuego was thought to be an integral part of the Terra Australis. With this, legally both parts of the Strait of Magellan remain within the kingdom of Chile.\nThe royal decree of 1563, issued on August 29 by King Felipe II separated the Governorate of Tucumán from the Governorate of Chile and transferred it to the Audience of Charcas, stating that \"we have agreed to set aside the said governorate of Tucumán, Juríes and Diaguitas from the said governorate of Chile and include them in the district of the said audience of Las Charcas\". With the birth of the Audiencia of Buenos Aires in 1663, the territory of Tucumán would be transferred to its jurisdiction.\nThe royal decree of 1570 in favor of the adelantado Juan Ortiz de Zárate modified the southern limits of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay Governorate 200 leagues to the south, from parallel 36° 57' to 48° 21', that is to say, a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast became dependent on that governorship in the Atlantic Patagonia. There was also an overlap between the degree 48° 05' to the north, the Strait to the south, the Atlantic to the east and the Pacific to the west with the governorate of Chile.\nHowever, in 1661, the territory was reintegrated to the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Chile, as it had been since the foundation of the kingdom.\n\nIn 1573 King Philip II dissolved the Real Audiencia of Concepción, restoring Rodrigo de Quiroga as governor of Chile by means of the Real Cédula de San Lorenzo el Real of August 5 in this cédula he speaks about the territory in the following terms:\n\n...you shall have the Government and Captaincy General of the said provinces of Chile according to and in the manner that Don García Hurtado de Mendoza and the adelantado Francisco de Villagra and the other governors that have been governors of the said provinces had it [....] we have the good will to enlarge and extend the said Governorate of Chile from the way Pedro de Valdivia had it for another one hundred and seventy leagues, more or less, which are from the confines of the Governorate that Pedro de Valdivia had until the Strait of Magellan\nThe territory that was assigned to Villagra and inherited to Quiroga had the Strait of Magellan \"inclusive\", with the territories to the south of it as well.\nWhen the Real Audiencia of Santiago de Chile was established on February 17, 1609, the Royal Decree that ordered its creation by King Felipe III included the entire territory of the provinces of Chile as part of its jurisdiction.\nOn November 1, 1661, King Philip IV issued a Royal Decree that restored the boundaries of Chile stipulating:\n\nall the Kingdom already named of Chile, with the cities, towns, places and territories that are included in the government of these provinces, both the regions that are today pacified and populated and those that could be conquered, populated and pacified in the interior and exterior of the Strait of Magellan and in the interior territory including up to the province of Cuyo.\nIn 1680 King Charles II ordered the promulgation of the Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies, in which Law 12 reaffirmed that the Audiencia de Chile should have: [....] which has as its district all the said Reyno de Chile, with the cities, towns, villages, places and lands included in the government of those provinces, as well as what is now pacified and populated, as well as what will be reduced, populated and pacified within and outside the Strait of Magellan and the land inside up to and including the province of Cuyo Eastern Patagonia was thus considered to be within the Kingdom of Chile.\nThe Spanish explorers hardly traveled through the Aysén channels and those who did, tried to find the way to the mythical City of the Caesars unsuccessfully.\n\nThe region of Trapananda (present-day Aysén) was incorporated to the domains of Chiloé being the geographical area located between the middle of the Chiloé archipelago and the Strait of Magellan, the final objective to be fortified for the Spanish empire. These domains covered as far as Cape Horn.\nBetween 1557 and 1679, twelve religious expeditions were made to explore the region.\nIn the old charts the Patagonian region, between parallels 48° and 50° South, appeared to be occupied almost exclusively by a large island called \"Campana\" separated from the mainland by the \"Calén Nation Channel\", nation that was supposed to have existed until the 16th century between parallels 48° and 49° south latitude.\nThe year 1741 occurs the shipwreck of the British ship HMS Wager in the area of the Guayaneco Archipelago. Following the event Spain increased its interest in the region, increasing expeditions to the Isthmus of Ofqui and sending Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries who transferred canoeists.\n\nBetween the years 1762 and 1767 as well as 1798 the Jesuit J. Vicuña visited the region. Juan Levien received a title deed between parallels 43° and 48° south latitude after his assistance to José de Moraleda.\nIn 1749 the rey Ferdinand VI of Spain ordered the construction of Fort San Fernando de Tenquehuén on the Taitao Peninsula, later dismantled. Previously the English admiral George Anson had promoted the creation of a settlement of his country on Inche Island.\nIn 1792 an expedition under the command of Francisco de Clemente y Miró together with Luis Lasqueti to Inche Island in the Chonos Archipelago.\nIn 1744 the Royal Officer of Santiago following orders from the Council of the Indies made a description of the kingdom that detailed the Magellanic Lands or Outer Chile within its jurisdiction:\n\nIt graduates and counts all this Kingdom of Chile at the present time from Cape Horn that is in the height of 56° to the Hill of San Benito in the height of 24° South to North \" in which is the uninhabited place that they call of Peru [...].It includes all the Pampa until the North Sea ending in the Bahía sin Fondo or next to the Río de los Leones at 44° of latitude, and declining from this point to the Strait of Magellan until Cape Horn by the beach of the map that includes this relation until 56° of latitude in which it is included, according to it and the account that has been made (1390) one thousand three hundred and ninety leagues of circumference throughout the Reyno, which are the most punctual demarcations, signs and the most certain boundaries that we have been able to acquire, by practical persons who live there and the faith in whose knowledge are its inhabitants by reason of the demarcation of the Reyno, Provinces and their lands with whom they share.\nThe limit described corresponds exactly with the extension of one hundred leagues of east–west width that was given to the governorship of Nueva Extremadura and provinces of Chile in the 16th century. With calculations made with data provided by geographers and pilots of the time of the conquest, it gives that the Spanish legua is more than 6 km today. With the calculation of the hundred leagues from the coast of the Pacific Ocean gives that approximately the limit reaches the 65th meridian west, in the gulf of San Matías, current port of San Antonio Oeste.\n\nIn 1748, a book published after an expedition requested by the king to America details: Occupies the dilated Kingdom of Chile that part of southern America which from the ends of Peru runs towards the southern pole to the Strait of Magellan... making a division between both kingdoms, as is said elsewhere, the uninhabited Atacama....\n\nOn April 26, 1761, the Viceroy of Peru and former Governor of Chile, Manuel de Amat y Juinent, sent to the Council of the Indies and the Court a report called Historia geográfica e hidrográfica del Reino de Chile which included Modern Chile (Patagonia) with an explicit description of the Atlantic coast as part of its jurisdiction, as well as a ten-page map of the entire southern tip of the continent, including the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. These documents were approved by the Council of the Indies, and there is a thank-you note dated November 16, 1761.\n\nSan Matías Bay; Cabo de Matas; source of the San Jorge River, which flows in the eastern part of the Sierra Nevada; Cabo San Jorge, on the eastern coast; Cabo Blanco, on the eastern coast; source of the Deseado River, which flows to the east; Bahía Deseada; Cabo San Julián, on the eastern coast; Bahía San Julián; Santa Cruz River mouth; Sebald Islands discovered by Sebaldo de Weert in 1699; Gallegos River mouth; Bocas del Estrecho; Puerto del Hambre; Bahía del Buen Suceso; Cabo de las Vírgenes; Cabo del Espíritu Santo; Cabo de San Sebastián; Bahía de la Posesión; Estrecho Le Maire; Tierra del Fuego; Cabo de Hornos.\n\nOn October 4, 1766, the king declared: from now on I declare the Government of the Malvinas dependent on that Captaincy General over the correspondence and further Providences that it may be convenient to establish. From that moment in 1766 and no other, the Malvinas Islands that Spain considered a Patagonian possession would be subject to Buenos Aires, ceasing to depend on the Captaincy General of Chile. On September 29 of the following year, the King forwarded to the Governor of Chile, Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga, the news about the islands that were made to reach Ruiz Puente.\n\nThe royal decrees spoke of the administration of the province of Nahuelhuapi by the kingdom of Chile.\n\nconfirm the mission named Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de indios puelches y poyas in the Nahuelhuapi Province of the Kingdom of Chile\nThe projects of segregation of the corregimiento of Cuyo were fought by the Cabildo of Santiago since at least 1765. In 1775 a memorial written by Manuel de Salas was sent to the king in which the entities of Chile and Cuyo were declared indissoluble and that if the inclusion of the Cuyo Province to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was successful, the whole Kingdom of Chile was also asked to be incorporated to it. After the royal decree of October 27, 1777, the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was declared constituted and under its jurisdiction:\n\n[...] the territories of the cities of Mendoza and San Juan that were in charge of the governorship of Chile\nThe southern boundary of the territories transferred to the new viceroyalty is the Diamante River, according to the founding act of the city of Mendoza and with the map of Juan de la Cruz Cano y Olmedilla of 1775, which was used by the king to create the new viceroyalty. The map shows the term \"Modern Chile\" in Patagonia, as well as the name \"Kingdom of Chile\" even in the eastern part of the Andes. The Deserted Region of Patagonia or Modern Chile bordered the domains of Buenos Aires at Cape Corrientes, a little north of the present city of Mar del Plata.\nAt the request of the viceroy of Peru Manuel de Amat y Junyent, King Charles III of Spain issued a royal order on August 20, 1767, by which he transferred the government of Chiloé to the direct jurisdiction of the viceroy of Peru on a provisional basis so that the construction of defenses could be facilitated. On March 28, 1768, the viceroy appointed Captain of Dragoons Carlos de Beranger as military governor to replace Manuel Fernández de Castelblanco. In the same provision, he provisionally separated Chiloé from the jurisdiction of the captain general of Chile and the Real Audiencia of Santiago:\n\n(...) to separate, at least for now, and with dependence of the approval of S. M., the temporary jurisdiction of that island and its adjacencies from the general captaincy of Chile and the royal audience of Santiago; and to subject them to the latter from where with more promptness and ease military and political aid can be administered by means of frequent navigation, as from this capital the resources of the situado i sinodo (...) As viceroy and general captain of the kingdoms of Peru and Chile, I command in the name of S. M. that the aforementioned province, its castles, islands, islands, castles, castles, islands, castles, islands, and the royal audience of Santiago, and to subject them to the latter from where with more promptness and ease military and political aid can be administered by means of frequent navigation. that the aforementioned province, its castles, islands, squares and fortresses, for now and while the operations that are going to be undertaken for their fortification, better service of the king and benefit of said natives last, remain subject to this general captaincy and in the political to this royal audience, where they can interpose the resources that the laws allow.\nCharles III approved the provision of the viceroy through the royal order of October 15, 1768, with Chiloé remaining under the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Concepción.\nOn October 1, 1780, the king issued another royal order returning Chiloé to the dependency of the government of Chile, but the order was never carried out by the viceroy of Peru, which was among his attributions since any royal order could not be executed until receiving the cúmplase from the viceroy.\nBy royal decree of May 19, 1784, Chiloé was transformed into a intendancy and Francisco Hurtado del Pino was appointed governor intendant. However, due to various problems during Hurtado's administration, in 1789 the king reverted Chiloé to its status of political and military government, thus abolishing the intendancy.\nHowever, all official maps of the crown continued to show Chiloé and its district within Chile. The intendancy depended in religious matters on the bishopric of Concepción, while in military matters it had to commensurate its decisions with the commander of the Chilean Frontiers. Hurtado describes the limits of the new administrative entity:\n\n[...] to the north is the Río Bueno, to the south Cape Horn, to the east the Andes Mountains and all the mainland and islands between these three directions, adjacent to the coast.\nIn 1787, the Intendencia de Santiago and the Intendencia de Concepción were created. The former had the Atacama Desert as its northern legal border; the latter extended to the Biobío River, plus some nearby territories, but on its left bank. According to what was communicated by the Spanish brigadier Ambrosio de Benavides Medina -appointed by King Carlos III of Spain as governor of the Kingdom of Chile- and the regent Tomas Antonio Álvarez de Acevedo y Robles:\n\n[...] the general captaincy of Chile was to be divided into only two intendancies, that of Santiago which would extend from the southern confines of the viceroyalty of Peru to the banks of the Maule River; and that of Concepción which would begin at this river and end at the last forts of the Araucanian frontier.\nthe 3rd foundation of Osorno, authorized to Ambrosio O'Higgins by Royal Order of December 7, 1793, partially reduced the Government of Chiloé to the benefit of the Intendancy of Concepción. Its territorial limits, according to O'Higgins himself, were:\n\n[...] on the south the Maypue River, where the province of Chiloé ends, on the north the Pilmaiquén River, on the west the coast between Río Bueno and Maypué, and on the east the great mountain range.\n.\nOn February 23, 1802, by Royal Order, copies of Cano y Olmedilla's map were distributed to the ministries and the Council of the Indies. This map shows Patagonia within the Kingdom of Chile, noting there: \"Modern Chile that the ancient geographers called Magellanic Land, of the Patagones and the Caesars, so celebrated by the vulgar as there are no nations in these countries more numerous and numerous than the Aucas, Puelches, Toelches and Serranos from whom other partialities that deal with the Spaniards originate\". The Madrid government in 1802 authorized the sale of the map to the public.\nIn the Archivo General de Indias is preserved a manuscript of the first delineator of the Hydrographic Repository of the Crown of Spain, the naval lieutenant Andrés Baleato. Created by a royal charter, it ends with three notes, in the second of which he enunciates:\n\nOn the northern coast of the Strait of Magellan is the Morro de Santa Águeda or Cape Froward, from which the Andes Mountain Range runs northward and divides the Patagonian land into eastern and western. The eastern part was always considered to belong to the Viceroyalty of Buenos Aires up to the Strait of Magellan, although it did not have more establishments than up to the Río Negro and the Guardia de la Bahía de San José. Western Patagonia belonged to the Kingdom of Chile up to the Strait of Magellan, although the conversions of Indians did not go beyond the southernmost part of the Chiloe Archipelago, with a few entries made by missionaries in the Guaytecas or Chonos Archipelago. The Tierra del Fuego had no establishments or conversions belonging to Buenos Aires or Chile and its separation from the continent by the Strait of Magellan made its belonging imaginary.\nBy order of the intendant of Concepción, the provincial mayor Mr. Luis de la Cruz undertook in 1806 the exploration of a road to the Atlantic. The intendant authorized it saying \"how it could be extended to our establishments on the coast of Patagonia\". Cruz was accompanied by a group of officers of the royal army of Chile and a short distance from Buenos Aires, he told the cacique Aucae Curripilún: \"You were always poor until the Spaniards came to these Chilean deserts to breed horses, cows and sheep for your sustenance\". And in a memorial presented to the Court of the Consulate of Santiago in 1807, the explorer said: \"The Consulate will find that this kingdom is united with that of Buenos Aires, leaving in our favor as much land as the kingdom of Chile can enjoy in all its extension. You will find that the land qualities are excellent for extending our cattle ranches, and that our commerce extends to Europe. You will find safe ways to defend us by the pathogenic coasts of our friends (the Indians) for defense, without multiplying expenses to the treasury and by means of them extend our discoveries and conquests to the most remote places\".\n\n\n== Disputed territory ==\n\nThe official maps of the Crown, and royal decrees mention the Patagonian region. The map of Juan de la Cruz Cano y Olmedilla of 1775, the Jesuit missions of the Archbishopric of Santiago that tried at the end of the 16th century to evangelize the Indians of Nahuel Huapi, and the settlements on the Atlantic coast are antecedents of the presence of Spain in the region. Thus, Patagonia, was even more extensive than the region that currently bears that name, encompassing almost all of Argentina's current maritime coastline and the Central Dry Pampa that it does not currently encompass.\nIt started much further north than the Colorado River, covering the south of the current Province of Mendoza, Buenos Aires, as well as the whole of La Pampa, San Luis, and even parts of the west of Córdoba.\nIts limit was in the rivers Diamante River, Quinto River, and in the river Hueuque, and when being separated these three rivers by extensive territories, it also used three imaginary lines by fields, or natural by mountains (a line that passed over the Desaguadero River, another that went down by the chained lagoons of the west of Buenos Aires, and another by the mountains of Buenos Aires to the sea) that joined these points according to the official document of Cano y Olmedilla of 1775.\n\nIn 1810, the date agreed upon by the nascent Spanish-American republics to apply the principle of uti possidetis juris, Patagonia was largely unoccupied by the Spanish Empire, which held meetings with indigenous chieftains, such as those organized by Ambrosio O'Higgins.\nThe Patagonian region had the presence of Spanish forts on its Atlantic coast and belonged de jure to the empire thanks to the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, so both Chile and Argentina rejected from the beginning that the territory had been res nullius, besides the latter concept would have benefited foreign powers such as Great Britain, which organized the expeditions where Charles Darwin was present, or France which had some interest in the Strait of Magellan.\nThe concept of uti possidetis juris was reaffirmed by Argentina and Chile in the Treaty of 1856, which ambiguously consigned the respect of the colonial borders between the signatory parties. The Eastern Patagonia dispute is based on the disagreement over the inherited boundary of the Spanish empire between Chile and the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.\nThe dispute between the two states over the Patagonian territories east of the Andes begins from 1843 onwards, after the foundation of Fort Bulnes by Chile, often including much of the shore of the Strait of Magellan to varying extents in turn as Tierra del Fuego. Only one year earlier there was an incident in the mountainous area of Talca.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the War of the Pacific, Chile focused its efforts on its north, as with the war against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, neglecting for a while, the occupation of Araucanía, Eastern Patagonia and Pampa Seca, leaving them for later. In 1843 Chile founded Fort Bulnes and in the 1870s occupied the territory south of the Santa Cruz River, founding the settlement called Puerto Gallegos (present-day Río Gallegos), while Argentina attempted to control San Gregorio Bay and controlled Isla Pavón and Isla de los Estados, as well as making great progress in the occupation of the north of the disputed region.\n\n\n=== Conflict with indigenous people of the region, with royalist bands and the Argentine occupation of northern Eastern Patagonia ===\n\nIn those territories bordering the incipient Argentine Republic, the indigenous people carried out the so-called \"malones\" perpetuating a theft of more than 8 million head of cattle (it should be taken into account that the raw material was more expensive than today in the world market), harming 35 thousand people, including women who were kidnapped, raped, who returned with children resulting from this and with serious psychological sequels.\nAlthough few antecedents of damage by Argentines prior to the 1820s against the Indians can be found, the truth is that in many cases the Creole was seen by the Indian as an invader, and sought to attack him, to defend himself and to obtain provisions. In other cases, the attacks corresponded to political actions due to the adhesion of many Indians to the royalist cause. These incursions came from the Pampa Seca, and from Patagonia.\nJuan Manuel de Rosas, before coming to power, set up a defense group in 1819, with which he began explorations from Chascomús to Neuquén and Mar Chiquita on November 15, 1825.\nThe government of the United Provinces represented by Buenos Aires and specifically General Juan Gregorio de Las Heras, who arrived in Chile in 1813, did not express his annoyance on the part of the Río de la Plata government against the band of the Pincheira brothers, but rather, he expected from President Joaquín Prieto a reaction against the band, considering the territories where the band acted (Neuquén and other territories east of the Andes) out of his jurisdiction.\n\nThe Pincheira carried out guerrilla actions in conjunction with approximately 300 other gunmen, in favor of the royalist cause, as did indigenous people who belonged to this side, even in that decade.\n\nRosas tried to reach direct agreements with the Pincheira, defending for Argentina what was the southern indigenous border of the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. With this objective he sent a letter to José Antonio Zúñiga, commander of the parties, dated November 8, 1830, describing the border that they should not cross:\n\nThe guards that belong to this province of my command and to that of Santa Fe, and which it is necessary that U.U. respect as a sacred thing, are: Patagones, Bahía Blanca, Tandel, Solores, Chascomuz, Ranchos, Monte, Lobos, Navarro, Luján, Fortín de Areco, Salto, Pergaminos, Rojas, Mercedes and Melincué. This is the inside line. The outside one runs from Bahía Blanca to Trimosí, from Trimosí to Cruz de la Guerra, from Cruz de la Guerra to Potroso, and from Potroso to Mercedes and Melincué, which line it is equally necessary that U.U. should respect. as the most sacred with all the estancias that are within them\n\nIn 1833 and early 1834, Juan Manuel de Rosas commanded the military expedition known as the Rosas Desert Campaign, which was carried out during the government of Juan Ramón Balcarce against the Pampas Indians, the ranqueles, the tehuelches and the mapuches, located in the pampas and the north of Patagonia and which counted with the initial collaboration of the provinces affected by the Amerindian frontier.\n\nThe campaign had several purposes, all of them related, which were: to submit the Indians of the desierto or the interior land to the Creole obedience, to put an end to the Indigenous malones that constantly plagued the interior populations, to rescue the captives held by the aborigines, to incorporate lands for agriculture and cattle raising and to make effective the provincial sovereignties over the raided territories.\nSeveral decades later, between 1878 and 1885, Julio Argentino Roca led the conquest of the Desert by which he conquered large extensions of territory that was in the hands of the Indigenous people, and which was legally in dispute with Chile, occupying the disputed territory to the north.\nThe first part of the so-called Desert Campaign, led by General Roca, was from 1879 to 1881 and it reached up to the Negro River. Only as a result of the treaty of 1881, the Desert campaign continued afterwards and crossed the Negro River where it was projected up to, approximately, what is now Rio Gallegos.\n\n\n=== Proposal of annexation of Cuyo to Chile ===\n\nDuring the civil wars in the River Plate, secession began to be considered in Cuyo. Isolation from the rest of the territory helped to create a feeling of reincorporation to Chile from which it was segregated in 1776. The main commercial relations of Mendoza and the surrounding cities were still linked to the Pacific and not to the Atlantic.\nIn 1835 a mission was sent to Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago with Juan Domingo Castro y Calvo and Juan de Rozas Corres, to propose the annexation in colloquial terms. At the same time, the influential Argentine citizens José Lisandro Calle, Vicente Gil and Casimiro Recuero they sought to approach Minister Diego Portales, however, he rejected the offer, arguing that such an annexation would have been a great responsibility of a province located on the other side of the Andes. Calle insisted by sending him a letter on March 11 to his Hacienda Rayado, in La Ligua. He argued that the Andes were \"a hundred times\" less difficult to cross than the desert that separated Mendoza from Buenos Aires and the Atlantic. This letter went unanswered, and instead a trade agreement was signed on April 3, ratified in Mendoza on July 3 and in Santiago on October 22.\nFurthermore, the letter suggested that it would not be difficult to seize Mendoza, San Luis and San Juan, and to \"admit them into the political association of this country\", he wrote further arguing that the Mendocineans sympathized by blood ties with Chile much more than with the provinces of Córdoba, Buenos Aires or Salta, which has no cultural, linguistic and musical ties and that they were willing to go to war with Chile against the littoral provinces. Colonel Lorenzo Barcala was shot on August 1, 1835, accused of conspiring to assassinate the federal authorities of the province and of conspiring to make Mendoza, San Luis and San Juan part of Chile.\nAlthough Cuyo had the Diamante River as its boundary, had it accepted, the Republic of Chile would have effectively controlled territory east of the Andes at an early stage, which would have facilitated colonization efforts in Eastern Patagonia.\n\n\n=== Bernardo O'Higgins refers to the whole of Patagonia as Chilean ===\n\nIn 1830 the Chilean politician Bernardo O'Higgins (Ambrosio's son) sent the Chilean president Joaquín Prieto a letter:\n\nThese matters, I repeat, that occupy my imagination allow me, my dear general, not only to recommend you, but also to impress upon you the great importance of calculating and acquiring by all possible means the friendship, not only of the Araucanians, but even more vigorously, of the Pehuenches and Huilliches, agreeing as I do with Molina, that all the inhabitants of the valleys of the East, as well as of the West of the Andes, are Chileans. I consider the Pehuenches, Puelches and Patagonians as our countrymen as the others born north of the BíoBío; and after the Independence of our country, no favorable event could give me greater satisfaction than to witness the civilization of all the children of Chile on both sides of the great mountain range and their union in one great family [...].I rejoice, then, my dear general, in the confidence that the day is not far distant when the barbarous and wandering woodcutter of the Pampas will become a civilized shepherd, and the poor and naked savage of the Tierra del Fuego an industrious and well-to-do fisherman\nThe following year he sends a letter to the British Royal Navy talking about his country:\n\nChile old and new extends in the Pacific from Mejillones Bay to South New Shetland, at latitude 65° South and in the Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic from San Jose Peninsula at latitude 42° to New South Shetland, that is, 23° with a superabundance of excellent harbors in both oceans, and all of them salubrious in all seasons. A simple glance at the map of South America suffices to prove that Chile, as described above, holds the keys to that vast portion of the South Atlantic. \nHe spent the year 1840 in his Montalván hacienda, concerned during the day with the work of the slaves and peasants and at night with the study and dispatching of correspondence to his friends. He was especially concerned about the situation of the indigenous tribes, which had to be integrated into civilization and the Catholic faith. He was also concerned about the integration and colonization of the Magellanic lands. He learned of the latest explorations of Commander Robert FitzRoy in the Patagonian channels and considered that the government should urgently exercise its sovereignty in the region and facilitate the navigation of the Strait of Magellan through the use of steam tugboats.\nOn the morning of October 24, 1842, he felt energetic so he had himself dressed, wanted to be seated in an armchair, but he could not stand it, so he was laid back on his bed. Suddenly, in the midst of his shortness of breath, he exclaimed: \"Magallanes!\" and expired, dying on the spot.\n\n\n=== Incident in the mountainous area of Talca ===\n\nIn the context of the tensions between the unitary and federal sides in River Plate politics, the presence of exiles from this country in Chile, and the cutting of commercial traffic with Mendoza ordered on April 13, 1842, by the Chilean president Manuel Bulnes, and the anger of the Mendocino governor José Félix Aldao (from the federal side of Juan Manuel de Rosas), a tense event occurs in March 1845, when the Chilean cattle rancher residing in Talca, Manuel Jirón, is approached by a gang of ten or twelve Argentine rustlers coming from Cuyo in his hacienda. They requested a payment of money in the name of the Governor's Office of Mendoza. They asked for payment for the cattle grazing that Jirón was doing in the pastures of El Yeso, Los Ángeles, Valenzuela and Montañés.\nJiron paid the amount when they threatened to take away his animals, which he later confirmed to the Chilean authorities, expecting compensation for the money.\nThe territory where this occurred is located south of the Diamante River in the mountainous area of Talca, so the territory was understood by Jiron as part of Chilean jurisdiction.\nThe Municipality of Talca was in charge of protecting the cattle ranchers in the area, and the investigation of the case showed that the aggressors came from San Rafael de Mendoza Fortress.\nThe Government of Chile sent a note of protest to the Government of Argentina saying:\n\nFrom the inquiry which by order of this Government has been made, it appears that the pastures are situated in Chilean territory, without any doubt having arisen on this point up to the present, both from the situation of the places, and from the immemorial possession of Chilean citizens, from the recognition of the bordering Indians, from history, tradition, and from whatever titles may be alleged in favor of the rights of sovereignty and property. Not only, therefore, has an illegal act of force and depredation been committed against Chilean citizens, but also an attack against the sovereignty of this Republic and an outrageous violation of its territory.\nTo which Argentina did not protest.\nOn December 4, 1846, a technical commission was created in Buenos Aires, composed of Carmen José Domínguez and Lieutenant Nicolás Villanueva, which published on April 27, 1847, in which they argued the territories where the incident occurred as Argentine, although not specifying whether or not they belonged to the province of Cuyo, as they were south of the Diamante River:\n\nThe Llaretas and Planchón mountain ranges, which are designated by the attached plan, are an extension of the previous ones, and the Valenzuela, Montañés, Yeso and Los Ángeles valleys, which are in the same situation as that of Tunuyán, cannot by any means be considered an integral part of Chilean territory\n\nThe Argentine president, Juan Manuel de Rosas, sent officials to tax Talca ranchers in the area in question in 1847 and 1848. By then he had already resolved to incorporate into his country the territory south of the Diamante River to the Río Negro, most of which he knew after his 1833 expeditions.\nAfter the 1881 treaty the boundary divided the disputed area with the areas of Valle Hermoso, Las Leñas and the eastern sector of Paso Potrerillos for Argentina, and the lands near Curicó of Potrero Grande, Potrero Chico, El Planchón, Teno lagoons, those of the Maule river basin, such as the Maule river basin, such as the lagoon and river of La Invernada, and the sector of El Colorado for Chile.\n\n\n=== Chilean incorporation of Southern Patagonia during the 19th century ===\n\nBeing fully aware of how important it was for the future development of Chile to preserve full maritime communication and trade with the Atlantic powers, it was necessary for the republic to secure possession of the Strait of Magellan.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the government of President Bulnes sent a schooner (the \"Ancud\") to take possession of it in the name of the republic. The intendant of Chiloé Domingo Espiñeira organized and directed the operations that were executed by frigate captain John Williams Wilson, who finally carried out the Takeover of the Strait of Magellan on September 21, 1843, at the historic site of Puerto del Hambre, founding Fuerte Bulnes.\n\nThis was done in part of the eastern section, that is, in a sector between the Andean mountain range and the Atlantic, so that from that moment Chile began to exercise rights of possession east of the Andes ...we take possession of the Straits of Magellan and its territory in the name of the Republic of Chile, to whom it belongs as declared in Article 1 of its Political Constitution,.... The addition of \"i su territorio\" would later give Chilean chancellors the argument that the dispute with Argentina was not limited only to the shores of the strait, so that Chile's uninterrupted possession of it also granted it possession of a much larger inland area, at least as far as the Santa Cruz River.\nDue to the inhospitable climate it was not possible to form a large and stable population, the governor José de los Santos Mardones deemed it convenient to found the city of Punta Arenas in the Sandy Point (Punta Arenosa) in 1848, after six years of innumerable hardships, to the north of the territory and with a better climate.\nOnce the population finished moving and settling in the city of Punta Arenas, Fort Bulnes began its decadence and its ruins were even set on fire by the Chilean Army artillery lieutenant Miguel José Cambiaso during the Cambiaso Mutiny. Between 1941 and 1943 the reconstruction of the fort was carried out and it was reopened in 1943.\nIn 1852 the governor of Magallanes, Bernhard Eunom Philippi died in October of that year murdered by indigenous Tehuelche in an assault in the vicinity of Punta Arenas in Cabeza del Mar, while trying to resolve a local conflict by peaceful and diplomatic means, however, the reasons for his murder were not clarified by the authorities of the time, nor were the perpetrators of the crime convicted. The governor wanted to explore, populate and make southern Patagonia produce wealth. His death occurs when he was preparing to install an outpost to the north, which would have been followed by others, consolidating Chile's dominion in the southern territories.\nBetween 1852 and 1855 both countries held a very detailed historical-geographical debate, accumulating an important body of documents to prove their respective claims.\nMinister Antonio Varas upon learning of the historical studies published by Miguel Luis Amunátegui in 1853, considered them a revelation, however, the government did not divulge such knowledge nor did it instruct public officials in this regard. The Argentine government upon learning of Amunátegui's book, commissioned Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield in 1855 a response, which, in turn, was subsequently answered by Amunátegui.\nIn 1856 a Treaty was signed between both countries which reaffirmed their commitment to the principle of uti possidetis juris, however, they maintained their respective differences on what this was.\nIn 1859 the Argentine Luis Piedrabuena unofficially established a post on Pavón Island and in 1865 Welsh settlers in the service of Argentina established a settlement in Chubut with the intention of penetrating the territory in dispute between the two countries. In parallel, the governor of Magallanes claimed that the Chilean government did not have the necessary means to extend its authority over those distant Patagonian coasts.  The Chilean presence on that coast was occasionally manifested with the appearance of armed parties in search of fugitives or deserters. The lieutenant Miguel José Cambiaso, mutinied in 1851, was in the estuary of the Gallegos river, by order of José de los Santos Mardones and also the governor Jorge Schythe was there.\n\nAn example of how vital the possession of the Strait of Magellan was for the Chilean leadership of the time can be found in the description made by its chancellor, Adolfo Ibáñez Gutiérrez: The possession of the Strait of Magellan in all its extension is for Chile of such importance, that in it it looks bound, not only its progress and development, but also its own existence as an independent nation. That Strait is the path that Providence has opened to communicate with the continents that bathe the Atlantic Ocean and to give way to trade and industry from the Old World come to fertilize the countries located in the west.\nThere was a failed Chilean settlement in \"Puerto Gallegos\" on the banks of the homonymous river since March 4, 1873. The governor of Magallanes, Óscar Viel y Toro by order of the minister Adolfo Ibáñez Gutiérrez was in charge of founding the settlement, this would only last six weeks after the diplomatic agreement between this country and the Argentine Nation.\nIn 1879, British Captain of the Chilean Navy Juan Tomás Rogers first sighted the glacier, which he named \"Francisco Gormaz\", after the director of the Hydrographic Office of the Chilean Navy, the sponsoring organization of the discovering expedition. Some years later, Rudolph Hauthal, attached to the Argentine Boundary Commission, came across the glacier, and decided to name it \"Bismarck\" in honor of the then Prussian Chancellor. It is currently known as Perito Moreno Glacier.\nThe National Government, convinced of the need to preserve sovereignty on the Patagonian coasts, appoints the Vapor Villarino under the command of Captain Federico Spurr, to make the regular voyage between Buenos Aires and the ports of Patagonia.\nRío Gallegos, an Argentine settlement, was born when the Sub Prefectura Marítima (Maritime Sub Prefecture) was installed on December 19, 1885. Its destiny was apparently very modest, in the material aspect, but of dense content for its purpose: \"To exercise permanent, direct and categorical dominion over the continental end of the country, within the framework of the defense of the Sovereignty\".\n\n\n=== Dispute over the Strait of Magellan and the territories south of the Santa Cruz River ===\n\nArgentina claimed the Chilean takeover of the strait by means of the official letter of December 15, 1847, signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Felipe Arana.\nThis also occurred after an armed incident of cattle ranchers in the Neuquén area, in March of the same year, after which Manuel Camilo Vial, the Chilean Foreign Minister, referred to the problem saying that there was \"the need to prepare an exact demarcation of the boundaries of the territory of each of the two republics, which, both having belonged to the same government, cannot but be in a complete state of uncertainty\". The Argentine government responded by claiming for itself all the territory south of the Diamante River, including the Strait and Tierra del Fuego.\nIn 1848, the Chilean government invited the Argentine government to a comparative study of sovereign rights over Patagonia. Argentina accepted, but asked to postpone the debate because it wished to gather the necessary cartographies and documents for its plea, and so it expressed this to Chile.\nIn 1862 the Argentine sailor, Luis Piedrabuena, made an alliance with the cacique Casimiro Biguá to found a settlement in San Gregorio Bay in the Strait of Magellan. Casimiro Biguá was an old acquaintance in the Chilean settlement of Punta Arenas.\nDuring the visit to San Gregorio, Piedrabuena presented Casimiro with the Argentine flag of his ship, the former \"Nancy\", which had been renamed \"Espora\", in homage to a national sailor.\nBoth agreed that the eastern part of the strait should correspond to the sovereignty of Argentina.\nIn 1863, Piedrabuena arrived again at the sheltered bay of San Gregorio (a place that was his obsession) protected by the San Gregorio mountain range (about 200 meters high) and where hunting was abundant. There he had his second encounter with Casimiro, now the latter with the title of Cacique. The sailor told the Tehuelche about his idea of creating a colony of his country in San Gregorio itself, which would counterbalance the one Chile was developing in Punta Arenas, this idea had the enthusiastic support of Casimiro.\nFor this reason, at the end of 1864, Casimiro accompanied Piedrabuena on a sailing trip to the city of Buenos Aires to be presented to the national authorities and make them aware of the indigenous adhesion to the cause of the republic, negotiating a treaty that would be beneficial for both parties (the Argentine state and the Tehuelches).\n\nHis proposal detailed that he would make a: ...possession of the territory and port of San Gregorio in the strait (...) in the name of the Argentine Government; that if the government authorizes him to verify it, with all the indigenous forces at his disposal, he will respect the flag and the territory\"; that \"to start the village he intends to form, he only needs the Government to help him with the tools to build on the port a wooden house sufficient for the installation of himself and his family.'\"; that \"to start the village he intends to form, he only needs the Government to help him with the tools to build on the port a wooden house sufficient for the installation of himself and his family.\nThe Argentine president, Bartolomé Mitre, named Casimiro \"Cacique General de San Gregorio\" and promised to send the required aid. The Argentine government granted Doroteo Mendoza the rank of captain of National Guards and appointed him to be the advisor-secretary of Cacique Casimiro.\n\n.\nUpon returning to the strait, Casimiro showed a great attachment to the Argentine cause, beginning to perform acts of sovereign presence in the area. In an interview with the governor of Punta Arenas in 1865, he expressed his virtual ignorance of Chile's jurisdiction over the eastern Patagonian territory, showing him that he was acting not as a Tehuelche but as an Argentine authority, by showing him that he was paid by the authorities of El Plata and that he had a high military rank. The cacique was definitively won, by means of gifts, honors and entertainments, to the Argentine cause.\n\nIt is true, Mr. Governor, I am Argentine and I tell you that I am the principal chief of the Patagonian coasts up to the tips of the Andes mountain ranges, since I am the chief appointed by my Excellency the National Government of the Argentine Republic, which is the one that has given me my titles so that I can make myself respected everywhere in my pampa. The governor replied that if he answered that he really felt he was Chilean he would give him 9 ounces of gold as payment for services, but Casimiro indicated that it would not be possible because he \"was not Chilean, but Argentine\".\nCasimiro waited unsuccessfully in San Gregorio for the ship with the materials. Faced with the possible decision of the governor of Punta Arenas to extend the dominion of the Magellanic colony to the Santa Cruz River, Piedrabuena asked the cacique to leave the bay and move his entire tribe to Pavón Island. Casimiro gathered his hosts from two nuclei, one in the pampas and the other, in January 1865, in San Gregorio; both groups united at a point called Comlel (this denomination corresponds to Coy-Inlet) and finally marched to the island, where they arrived on February 14, settling their huts by the river, to continue waiting there for the ship that would bring the supplies to build the Magellanic settlement.\nIn that same year, a party of Indians arrived in Punta Arenas, old acquaintances of the governor, carrying an Argentine flag (until that occasion they had entered with the Chilean flag). The Chilean representative, annoyed by the incident, told them that he would no longer allow them to enter the colony with that flag, and asking them for it, he gave them the Chilean flag in exchange, telling them that it was \"a prettier one\". The latter immediately made them fly them on their awnings.\nA year later, Juan Cornell continued to demand that the shipment of the vessel with the materials be fulfilled, and even offered a private vessel, so that it would not represent any cost for the state. The fact was that the Argentine government had its eyes and energies focused on the northern border, and with Argentina already engaged in the war against Paraguay, its leaders were convinced that it would be a serious mistake to generate a new source of conflict with the western country. Meanwhile, Casimiro's secretary, Doroteo Mendoza, perished strangely at the hands of a cacique, on the return trip.\nIn May 1865 Casimiro returned from the pampas and wintered in the port of San Gregorio. The ship that was supposed to bring the promised materials never did. After the snows they returned to the pampas to hunt guanacos and choiques.\nPiedrabuena and Casimiro still kept alive the hope of being able to realize the foundational project, so both remained patiently expectant, waiting for a new opportunity.\nBut Piedrabuena was not discouraged, so that, without official support, he set sail from Buenos Aires on his fragile vessel to the southern regions on October 26, 1868, with the purpose of carrying out on his own the occupation of San Gregorio Bay for his country, a task that was thus reduced to his own human resources.\n\nThe navigation was tortuous due to the storms that accompanied him incessantly. First he went through his factory at Isla de los Estados and then to Isla Pavón, to finally set course for Punta Arenas. He was only able to anchor the \"Espora\" in the port of Punta Arenas in February 1869. During that year he worked on the Isla de los Estados. Finally he embarked, together with G. H. Gardener and two other men, for the strait. He tried to make land at the entrance of the strait to place the beacon, but furious storms prevented him from doing so, so he set course again for Punta Arenas. The day after arriving, he was visited by the governor, Lieutenant Commander of the Chilean Navy Oscar Viel y Toro, who recommended him \"not to populate that colony, wait for a diplomatic resolution between both governments to remain in friendship\", warning him that he was also authorized to prohibit it, counting on \"artillery\" to impose his purpose; in the same way he notified him that he would proceed in the same way with the luminous signal that the Argentine was planning to install at the eastern entrance of the strait.\nPiedrabuena at first gave in to the serious warning of the Chilean authority without insisting on his objectives, however, a few days later he sailed to San Gregorio Bay, where he arrived in March 1870, with the ships \"Espora\" and \"Julia\". On the shore of the bay, Piedrabuena had a wooden hut erected as an \"observatory\", with the apparent purpose of facilitating trade with the Tehuelches and the real intention of laying the foundations for the foundation of a colony. When Viel was warned, he ordered the construction to be dismantled and forced the Argentine sailor to leave the place. Faced with the possibility that the beacon he intended to erect would be destroyed by the artillery of Chilean ships, he decided to deposit it on Pavón Island until he received official authorization from the Argentine authorities, something that finally never happened because they wanted to avoid a conflict with Chile.\nSoon after, from Pavón Island, Piedrabuena returned to San Gregorio, surprised to see that the Chileans had not yet populated the port that had so dazzled him. There he met with Casimiro, to whom he warned him to be on the alert for the next moves of the Puntarenas authorities.\n\nPiedrabuena, displeased by the predictable hostility he was already suffering in Punta Arenas, and the attitudes of permanent rejection of the project he received from the succession of rulers who administered his country, wrote to a friend about his regret: As an Argentine, it is very embarrassing for me to have to observe impassively all the advances of the Chileans in this piece of soil of my homeland, which it seems that the government abandons to its pretensions (...) \"If I had instructions in writing and not verbally, it would not be me or my Patagonians who would abandon the bay of San Gregorio without achieving our attempts. Because of these and other things I am being the target of the hostilities of the Chileans in the colony, who do not cease to persecute me; and as if they did not have enough with my person, they are also furious with the interests I have in the colony. Their policy is to seek my ruin so that in this way I may be frightened and move away from these places (...) \"they will not achieve this as long as I feel Argentine blood flowing in my veins. I do not aspire to anything, I only want to have in my conscience the satisfaction of having fulfilled my duty as the most honest of Argentines, which may be worth something for my children tomorrow.\n\nAround 1874, the cacique Casimiro died as a result of alcoholism, and with him, the influence that Argentina tried to exert in the Strait of Magellan finally ended, since all the Tehuelche caciques (Olki, Sámel, Kaile, Cholpa, etc.) swore loyalty to Chile, even Casimiro's son, the cacique Papón, and all of them were assigned salaries and food rations, as well as the Chilean state, and the Chilean state assigned salaries and food rations to them.) swore loyalty to Chile, even Casimiro's son, cacique Papón, and to all of them the Chilean state assigned salaries and food rations, just as the Argentine state did with Casimiro when he was alive. Luis Piedrabuena remained in southern Patagonia until mid 1875, when he settled permanently in Buenos Aires, where he died on August 10, 1883, at the age of 49; in 1878 his wife had died, at the age of 41, victim of pulmonary tuberculosis, contracted during the harsh southern winters.\nHe achieved great renown in the colony of Magallanes from 1870 to 1890, to whom the governor Diego Dublé Almeyda granted the title of \"Chilean Subdelegate of Patagonia\" in 1873.\nCacique Papón established an alliance with the Chilean governor Diego Dublé Almeyda, so that the seven hundred Tehuelches who adhered to his intentions, from the territory located between the Santa Cruz River and the Strait of Magellan, would also swear allegiance to the Chilean State, which appointed him subdelegate of Chilean Patagonia.\nThe latter country, after renewing its alliance, would begin to populate the Magellanic continental coast from 1878 with sheep ranches, including in bahía San Gregorio, in addition to bringing cattle directly from the Falkland Islands.\nAdolfo Ibáñez Gutiérrez as Chilean Foreign Minister argued that the boundary with Argentina should be set at the 70th meridian west longitude, that is, to the east of the Andes mountain range, until it touched the Santa Cruz River, and from there to the Atlantic. To avoid a territorial and strategic imbalance.\n\n\n=== Fierro-Sarratea Pact ===\nOn December 6 of the same year, the Fierro-Sarratea pact was signed in Santiago de Chile by the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Alejandro Fierro and the Argentine consul in Santiago Mariano Sarratea. The agreement was approved by both houses of the Congress of Chile and on January 14, 1879, the Chilean government informed the Argentine government that it approved it. However, the Congress of Argentina never approved the agreement.\nArticle 6 established that until a boundary agreement was reached, Chile would exercise jurisdiction over the coasts of the Strait of Magellan and Argentina over East Patagonia coasts and its islands. On January 4, 1879, the corvette Cabo de Hornos commanded by Luis Piedrabuena arrived at Puerto Santa Cruz with the news of the cessation of hostilities between the two countries and carrying on board the surgeon major Federico R. Cuñado -grandson of the Spanish physician Gabriel Cuñado- in addition to carrying provisions, coal cargo and the launch steamboat Monte León needed to provide fresh water at Pavón Island, since the estuary of the river where the port was settled is brackish water. In addition, it would have arrived alongside the bomber República.\nPapón would be succeeded by his brother called Mulato in 1892, who ended up settling in a reserve in Chile, near Punta Arenas, until he died of smallpox in 1905.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic negotiations prior to the Treaty of 1881 ===\nThrough historical maps it is possible to follow the course of the negotiations that led to the signing of the treaty. The Chilean maps show Argentine proposals of 1872, 1876 and 1879, as status quo between the two countries until the definitive boundary treaty was signed.\n\nMap of Seelstrang of 1875\nOn the right we can appreciate the Argentine map made by Seelstrang and Tourmente in 1875 that was used by the Chilean minister in Buenos Aires, Diego Barros, to communicate on July 10, 1876, to his government in Santiago a proposal for a solution from the Argentine foreign minister, Bernardo de Irigoyen, extended during the negotiations that preceded the signing of the 1881 Treaty of Limits. The proposal is drawn with a red line and is in fact very similar to what is today the boundary between the two countries.\nThe map illustrates the difficulty of demarcation due to the lack of knowledge of the area. The map does not show any natural feature to mark the border, with the exception of some hills: Cerro Moore near Puerto Natales and further north Cerro Cay in front of the Guaitecas Islands.\nThis Argentine map shows the Argentine interpretation of the 1856 Treaty marked as a line of crosses (++++). It can be seen that the border passes a few kilometers east of the Chilean city Punta Arenas and continues through the center of the Strait of Magellan towards the Pacific Ocean (northwest) leaving all the islands south of the Strait of Magellan as Argentine territory.\n\nMap of Carlos Prieto\nThe following map on the right was made by the engineer Carlos Prieto of the Oficina Hidrográfica de Chile and published by the Chilean government in 1881 to show the genesis and content of the 1881 Boundary Treaty. Three proposals and the final solution are indicated in it:\n\nProposal of October 1872 marked with \"----\". This proposal offered to define the common border only up to the northern shore of the strait, leaving the division of the territories to the south for the future. The strait would be shared between Chile and Argentina.\nJuly 1876 proposal marked with \"-...-...-...\" which is the one we have seen on the Seelstrang and Tour map above. In Carlos Prieto's map it can be seen that in the 1876 proposal the border is not the 52nd parallel, as it is today, but somewhat further south, in favor of Argentina.\nMay 1879 proposal marked with a line \"......\". This delimited all the territories with a line that divided the strait east of Punta Arenas and divided the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego between Chile and Argentina by Bahía Inútil, Admiralty Channel crossing the Beagle Channel to continue along the Murray Channel. It left Navarino, Picton, Lennox and Nueva as Argentine territory. The islands Hoste Island, Wollaston Islands, Hornos Island, etc., as Chilean territory.\n\nProposition by Rufino de Elizalde\nAnother map that is related to the gestation of the Treaty of 1881 is that of the proposal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Rufino de Elizalde of March 1878. This map bears the minister's signature and is in the National Library of Chile. The boundary offered passes largely through canals, like that of May 1879, but leaves all islands south of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego under Chilean sovereignty. The \"legitimate boundary\" of the map, i.e., the Argentine interpretation of the 1856 Treaty, is drawn with a blue line and runs west of Punta Arenas, leaving Punta Arenas in Argentine territory.\nBoth Seelstrang and Tourmente's map (1875) and Rufino de Elizalde's map (1878) also show a point that would later be of fundamental importance in the Argentine argumentation during the Beagle conflict.\nArgentina postulated the bioceanic principle, according to which the uti possidetis juris of 1810, agreed in the Treaty of Limits of 1856, prevented Argentina from possessing coasts in the Pacific, Argentina assumed that implicitly Chile could not possess coasts in the Atlantic. The oceanic thesis would be one of the pillars of the Argentine presentation before the Arbitral Court of 1977.\nIn both maps the Argentine interpretation of the Treaty of 1856 left Argentina in possession of extensive coasts in the Pacific Ocean in contradiction with that thesis.\n\n\n=== Arturo Prat as a spy in Buenos Aires ===\n\nIn 1878 the now famous Chilean sailor, Arturo Prat, is sent to Buenos Aires as a spy and notes that the mood of the Argentine public was in favor of a war for Eastern Patagonia, as it was believed to be full of useful natural resources.\nHe was promoted to frigate captain on 25. By the end of the following year, and following the Argentine government's intentions to mark sovereignty in Patagonia, particularly in the Santa Cruz River, was commissioned for a few months by President Aníbal Pinto Garmendia to perform intelligence services in Uruguay and Argentina.\n{{blockquote|The purpose of your trip, Your Excellency told me, is to know if you are willing to go to Montevideo to find out what is being done in the Argentine Republic, in terms of armaments, military movements and all kinds of preparations that reveal a hostile character to Chile, since alarming telegrams are being received continuously, perhaps without real foundation, and what is desired is to know what is positive.\nOn 18 he arrived in Montevideo, where he introduced himself as a lawyer and writer, and stayed at the Hotel de la Paz. In December of the same year, he twice visited Buenos Aires, where he established contacts and met briefly with the president Nicolás Avellaneda. During his mission, he delivered a series of Argentine military and naval data requested by the Chilean government. He underestimated Argentina's effective military power, citing factors such as the impact of the economic crisis, the large number of foreigners and the inexperience of its sailors, but, at the same time, he warned about the accelerated preparations for war. On the possibility of conflict, he stated:\n\nI am no friend of war, but I also believe that excessive love for peace can harm us more than war itself, enervating the country and making us lose the influence that for our tranquility and the good of America we should and can exercise in America and that we do not put into practice out of pure selfishness.\nThe mission was not to his liking, so he requested his return to Chile after completing the essentials of his mission; on 28 he received authorization to return to Chile, and landed in Valparaíso in mid-February.\n\n\n=== Treaty of 1881, the basis of the present boundaries ===\n\nThe boundary treaty would be carried out between both disputing countries in the year 1881, with later corrections. These treaties ended much of the Southern Patagonia dispute, Argentina finally recognizing Chilean sovereignty over the entire Strait of Magellan, while Chile recognizes Argentine sovereignty over the Patagonian coasts north of the latter and the eastern portion of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego.\nThe Treaty fixes the border at the highest peaks and the watershed to the 52° parallel.\nChile in 1881 was fighting in the War of the Pacific against Peru and Bolivia, and with the treaty it also prevented Argentina from joining the alliance of its northern neighbors.\nArgentina previously in 1878 created the governorship of Patagonia, later, in 1884, the Law of National Territories (law 1532) is sanctioned, thus emerging the Patagonian territories with their own names: Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego.\nFor its part, Chile created in 1853 the Magallanes territory, covering all the territory claimed in Southern Patagonia, being diminished after the treaty of 1881. In 1929 the subdivision became the province of Magallanes.\nIn 1893 both countries signed a Border protocol, affecting the border line in the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and in 1902 the pactos de Mayo were signed based on new differences arising from the treaty of 1881, resulting in a Border Arbitral award that same year. This stopped the Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. Subsequently, differences continued to arise over the international boundary.\n\n\n== Legal discussion ==\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\nThe Argentine jurist Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield, once stated that Eastern Patagonia inherently belonged to the corregimiento de Cuyo during the Spanish empire, a region that was expressly transferred by the Crown to the newly created viceroyalty of La Plata, in 1776. Something only affirmed by him and not by other Argentines such as Pedro de Angelis who stipulated that the region depended on Buenos Aires or Bernardo de Irigoyen. According to the documents of the founding of Mendoza, Cuyo reached only as far as the Diamante River to the south.\nThe Junta de Poblaciones del Reino de Chile in an order of September 20, 1752 pointed out the limits corresponding to the corregimiento de Cuyo:\n\nChapter I – First of all, beginning with the easternmost part of the Kingdom, which is the vast Province of Cuyo, which shares terms with those of Tucuman and Rio de la Plata and Magellanic lands, and is divided to the west by the great snowy mountain range, by virtue of what was determined on May 12, 1745, in Chapter 12 of the General Assembly of f. 68, first book, and in attention to the greater need and precision that the Lords of this, particularly the most illustrious Bishop in his (...)\nDomingo Faustino Sarmiento, exiled in Chile, raised the possibility that Chile could possess the whole of Patagonia saying: It remains to be determined whether the title of the Viceroyalty of Buenos Aires expresses that the lands to the South of Mendoza, and still possessed by Chilean citizens, entered into the demarcation of the Viceroyalty. If not, Chile could claim all the territory between Magallanes and the provinces of Cuyo.\nThe Argentine politician Juan Bautista Alberdi said: For example, as an Argentine, if I were the undisputed owner of those three deserts [Patagonia, Strait and Tierra del Fuego], I would give most of them to Chile, in the interest of my country itself, not because my country is less beloved than Chile. I would give them free to Chile because Chile needs them more than we do, since its territory is smaller; it is more capable of populating and civilizing them than we are, as is being shown by the fact of exploring them, colonizing them, making them useful for Humanity in general.\" (...) \"The Argentine interest is not in being the nominal and abstract owner of those deserts, but in those deserts ceasing to be so or being populated by our civilized race, which is that of Chile, instead of being populated by savage Indians, who are the scourge of our campaigns. Occupied, populated, civilized, enriched those territories, today deserted and savage, by Chileans, who are our brothers, we would have rich and civilized neighbors, instead of the poor, thieving and savage neighbors we have today.\nLater in the 20th century Argentine authors would argue that all territory south of the Biobío River would have belonged to the rioplatense jurisdiction by the mere fact of the impossibility of being occupied by the Spaniards for the most part.\n\n\n=== Chile ===\n\nIn Chile during the 19th century, intellectuals such as Miguel Luis Amunátegui with his book \"Historia de las Fronteras de Chile\", the 20 volumes of \"Historia de Chile desde la prehistoria hasta 1891\", by Francisco Antonio Encina and \"Estudio histórico sobre el descubrimiento y conquista de la Patagonia y de la Tierra del Fuego\" by Carlos Morla Vicuña, argued that the whole of Patagonia, including the Eastern, belonged by right to Chile based on documents from the time of the Spanish empire.\n\n\n=== Res nullius ===\n\nThere is a position that states that the region did not belong to any of the countries since it was not largely occupied by Spain and the territory would not have been delimited, however, similar to the case of the Peruvian Amazon, the region was indeed claimed de jure by Spain.\nForeign maps show Patagonia as res nullius, defying the Spanish claim or later that of the South American republics.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBoundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina\nArgentine–Chilean naval arms race\nDiego Barros Arana\nAdolfo Ibáñez Gutiérrez\nVicente Pérez Rosales\nCarlos Morla Vicuña\nMexican–American War\nFalkland Islands sovereignty dispute\nAtacama Desert border dispute\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St. Onuphrius Monastery is a stauropegion Orthodox male monastery in Jabłeczna, under the jurisdiction of the Polish Orthodox Church.\nThe monastery was founded no later than the late 15th century. According to legend, its establishment was determined by the miraculous appearance of the icon of St. Onuphrius above the Bug river. Thanks to successive land grants from the subsequent owners of Jabłeczna, the monastery became a significant center of Orthodox worship in Chełm Land. After the Union of Brest, the monks of Jabłeczna refused to accept its provisions and, despite pressure, remained Orthodox, remaining an important center of dissenters until the fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The situation of the monastery underwent a total change after the three partitions of Poland and the establishment of the Congress Poland in personal union with Russia. From then on, the monastery was financially supported by the Russian authorities and, at their behest, engaged in promoting Orthodoxy and Russification of Chełm Land, especially after the conversion of Chełm Eparchy in 1875. This was one of the reasons why the monks engaged in social and educational activities. However, the low level of education of the monks, their insufficient number, and the fact that the majority of them were not of Russian nationality meant that the monastery did not fulfill its assigned tasks in terms of promoting Russianness and Orthodoxy among the population of Chełm Land.\nDespite restrictions imposed by the authorities of independent Poland due to the role of the monastery during the partitions, the monastery functioned throughout the entire interwar period. During World War II, it was burned down in 1942 by a German border guard unit. However, it formally did not cease to function and remained active throughout the entire period of the Polish People's Republic, despite difficult material conditions (on the orders of the Stalinist authorities, it lost all its assets except residential buildings and churches), as the only male monastery of the Polish Orthodox Church.\nSince 1999, it has had the status of a stauropegion monastery and is directly subordinate to the Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, who manages the community through his representative. There is also a parish attached to the monastery, with the monastery's representative serving as its parson.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nAccording to legend, the first monastic community in Jabłeczna was established when the icon of St. Onuphrius floated down the Bug river to the village. For this reason, he became the patron saint of the monastery. Another legend tells that St. Onuphrius appeared to a group of fishermen by the Bug river, announcing that his name would be glorified in that place. Later, an image of the hermit was found in the same spot by the riverbank, and the locals retrieved it and hung it on a tree, where they began to pray to the saint. Not wanting to leave the miraculous icon unattended in a remote location, a group of men remained by the oak tree permanently. They later built a chapel next to it and took monastic vows themselves. The cult of St. Onuphrius significantly developed in the western part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the second half of the 15th century.\nIn older literature on the subject (works from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries), there are views placing the establishment of the monastery in the 16th century (according to various authors, either at its beginning or closer to its end). According to Father Serafim Żeleźniakowicz, the author of the most comprehensive monograph dedicated to the monastery, this view does not hold up in the light of newer research. In 1522, the monastery in Jabłeczna is already mentioned in a document issued by King Sigismund I the Old. In another document from 1527, the monastery is described as a community that has existed for a longer time. The presence of the Great Schema Cyril, who took his vows in 1516, also indicates the longer existence of the community. Vows of this degree could only be taken in a community with a longer tradition.\nSome authors active at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries placed the establishment of the monastery in an even more distant past, pointing to the mid-13th century (Father F. Gorbaczowski). Father Żeleźniakowicz also considers this view insufficiently documented. However, Antoni Mironowicz considers the establishment of the monastery in this period possible. The monastery certainly existed before 1498, as the oldest Gospel Book preserved in the monastery dates back to that year. This could have been presented to the monks at the founding of the community, but it could also have been passed to the monastery already in existence. In 1527, the residents of Brest presented the monks with a manuscript containing their rule, probably from 1487. The probable founder of the monastery was the Zabrzeziński (Zaberezinski) family, the owners of the village of Jabłeczna. However, establishing this fact beyond any doubt is not possible due to the disappearance of relevant documents in the 18th century. Another document, issued in 1499, granting the village of Jabłeczna to Mikołaj Nassut, indicates that the monastery functioned in the village but was treated as a separate enclave.\n\n\n=== Monastery's growing importance as a center of worship ===\nFrom 1527 comes a document confirming that pilgrims from Berestechko participated in the monastery's patronal feast. The entire 16th century was a period of gradual increase in the authority of the monastery. However, until the Union of Brest, it remained a center of cult with only regional significance. The document from 1527 indicates that the abbot of the monastery was Hegumen Cyril, and besides him, there were at least two monks in the monastery.\nSuccessive owners of Jabłeczna – the Zabrzeziński, Nassut, Bohowitynowicz, Bogusz, Proński, Leszczyński, Sapieha, and Kodeński families – supported the monastery materially. Through the grants they received, the monastery acquired 1,400 hectares of arable land, forests, and meadows on both banks of the Bug river. Special benefactors of the monastery were Teodora Andriyivna Bohowitynowicz (née Sanguszko) and her daughter Teodora Bohowitynowicz, later Prońska, who remained a patroness of the community even after her husband converted to Catholicism.\n\n\n=== From the conclusion of the Union of Brest to the fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===\nThe monks of the Jabłeczna monastery did not accept the provisions of the Union of Brest, and the monastery became a center of Orthodox resistance against its implementation. Monks opposed to the union from those monasteries that decided to accept it joined the community. The Jabłeczna monastery became the residence of the Orthodox Bishop of Chełm, Paisius (Cherkawski), who lived there and simultaneously served as the abbot until his death in 1633. After Paisius' death, the monastery remained without a superior for several years. In order to change this situation, the owner of Jabłeczna, Władysław Leszczyński, turned to the abbot of the Mielce monastery, Archimandrite Joseph, requesting a monk capable of leading the community in Jabłeczna. This occurred no later than the early 1640s; Hieromonk Makary (Kornilovich) arrived in Jabłeczna at that time. He initiated a moral renewal in the community and carried out a general renovation of its buildings. In the 17th century, the monastery complex consisted of the Church of St. Onuphrius with the Chapel of the Meeting of the Lord, a refectory with the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God, a bell tower (built in 1651), the abbot's house, monks' cells, and farm buildings. The renovation of the monastery was completed around 1659. In the same year, Metropolitan Dionysius Balaban of Kyiv expressed his recognition of Makary's activities in writing; Makary already held the rank of hegumen at that time. The clergyman died in 1677, enjoying immense authority among the monks.\nIn 1670, the Jabłeczna monastery became the last Orthodox pastoral outpost in the region. When the monastery of St. Nicholas in Mielce accepted the provisions of the Union, of which the Jabłeczna community was a filial, with the help of the owner of Jabłeczna, Andrzej Leszczyński, the monks came under the direct jurisdiction of the Orthodox bishops of Lutsk. After the Lutsk diocese joined the Uniate Church, the superior of the monastery became the Orthodox Metropolis of Kyiv. The prestige of the monastery among the Orthodox population grew as the number of monasteries of this denomination in the Commonwealth decreased. From 1 March 1681, the pastoral activity of the monks was further restricted: on this date, a decree from King John III Sobieski was issued to \"non-Uniate\" communities, prohibiting Orthodox clergy from serving in villages where Uniate churches were located. During this period, a significant portion of the parishioners of the Jabłeczna pastoral outpost came from villages where former Orthodox churches were in the hands of the Uniats, and who did not want to convert to Catholicism.\nThe situation of the monastery changed radically in 1699, when the Jabłeczna estates were purchased by Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, a Catholic (unlike the previous owners of the village). The Radziwiłł family exerted strong pressure on the monastery to join the Uniate Church, and, using their patronage rights, forced the local clergy to convert in the parish. in 1701, in order to defend their position, the monastery submitted as a filial to the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius. In 1724, the monastery was deprived of four parish churches. In 1752, Hieronim Florian Radziwiłł founded a Uniate church in the village of Jabłeczna. The Uniate parish took over a significant part of the monastery's property and contributed to the conversion of the local population to the Union. Three years later, an armed attack on the monastery took place, in which Basilian monks from the monastery in Biała Podlaska also participated. During the attack, the monastery was plundered, and documents stored in it were stolen, including those confirming land ownership. Nevertheless, the Jabłeczna community remained faithful to Orthodoxy. From 1767, the monastery received regular financial support from the Kyiv Metropolis. Despite this, its financial situation was very poor in 1770, which was related to poor management by Hegumen Moses, who fled the monastery that year.\nA description of the monastery from 1775 indicates that it contained a wooden, triple-domed temple, 36 ells (21 meters) long, 27.5 ells (16 meters) wide, and 53 ells (31.5 meters) high. Separate buildings included a bell tower, a refectory with a church, a bakery, and a kitchen. To the northeast was the abbot's house. Seven monk cells were located in two buildings to the south, and one was in the bell tower. The monks also had a granary, two food warehouses, two stables, and a bathhouse. These buildings were in poor technical condition and required renovation. Among the movable property of the monastery were mentioned 25 sets of priestly vestments in the sacristy, as well as six Gospel Books, 16 candlesticks, and two chandeliers. The monastery had a library, and there were five bells in the bell tower. Describing the monastery in 1785, Bishop of Pereiaslav, Viktor (Sadkovsky), claimed that he found not monastery buildings on the site, but rather ruins. In 1793, the community lived in extreme poverty, and money for necessary building repairs was obtained through collections in other monasteries.\n\n\n=== Period of partitions ===\n\n\n==== 1795–1875 ====\nAs a result of the provisions of the Third Partition of Poland, the land of Chełm found itself within the borders of Austria, which meant that the monastery in Jabłeczna came under the jurisdiction of the Bukovinian Metropolis. However, due to the distance of the metropolitans' seat from Jabłeczna, it still remained under the actual spiritual care of the bishops of Minsk. After the establishment of the Congress Kingdom, which was in a personal union with the Russian Empire, the Orthodox structures in the Congress Kingdom, including the monastery, were incorporated into the Diocese of Minsk. Father Żeleźniakowicz disagreed with the view that the jurisdiction of the bishops of Minsk over the Jabłeczna community was formally extended in 1815, stating that according to him, the monastery came under their control only in 1825, as there were no clear regulations in this regard before. In 1840, an independent Warsaw and Novohrad-Volynsky Eparchy was established, covering the territory of the Kingdom, and it was under its jurisdiction that the monastery fell. In 1816, the monastery was inhabited by three monks. Their main source of livelihood was land cultivation. The financial situation of the monastery in the 1820s was so difficult that in 1828 it was granted assistance in the amount of 2,000 złotys from the fund for the Greco-Russian clergy. Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the monastery was involved in legal proceedings over the management of the lands with Count Michał Grabowski, who had received some of the land on lease as early as 1787 and then refused to return it after the leases expired. At that time, it was already the only Orthodox monastery in the Chełm and Podlasie region; it also served as a retirement home for retired clergy. In 1832, due to the poverty of the monastery, Father Teofil Nowicki, who served as the dean of churches and monasteries in the Kingdom of Poland, obtained a partial tax exemption for it, and in 1833, another grant of 300 rubles. In that year, the monastery was inhabited by five monks, a lay brother, and a widowed priest without monastic vows.\nAccording to a description from 1835, the monastery owned 45 dessiatins of land on the left bank of the Bug river and 46 dessiatins of meadows on the right bank. The poverty of the monastery did not diminish its authority among the faithful, which remained very significant. In 1836, the Jabłeczna community consisted of 5 monks.\n\nDue to the very poor technical condition of the monastery buildings, work began in 1838 on the construction of a new residential building for the monks, the Church of St. Onuphrius, a bell tower, and a surrounding wall. According to Grzegorz Kuprianowicz, the initiator of these works was Bishop Antoni of Warsaw. According to Father Żeleźniakowicz, the initiator of the renovation was Bishop Innocenty of Volhynia, who had been calling for it since his visit to Jabłeczna in 1833, and Bishop Antoni only completed his efforts. On 19 May 1838, the cornerstone for the construction of the Church of St. Onuphrius was laid, and its dedication took place on 6 December 1840. The cost of its construction, together with the cost of building the residential building, amounted to 29,585 rubles. During the tenure of Archimandrite Joannicius (Mosakowski) as the monastery's superior, from 1832 to 1854, a two-class school open to all, regardless of denomination, was opened in 1838, and the agricultural estate was reorganized.\nIn 1857, 24 students attended the school run by the monastery. In 1843, the Jabłeczna community consisted of 5 monks and 4 lay brothers, the following year – 6 monks and 1 lay brother, and in 1845 – 5 monks and 3 lay brothers. In the middle of the century, the monastery was home to 5 monks, 5 lay brothers, two widowed deacons, and one widowed priest.\nIn a report by the Archbishop of Warsaw to the Most Holy Synod, the monastery in Jabłeczna was described as a center of high spiritual level. In 1859, the monastery, which had hitherto functioned as non-regular, was entered into the register of second-class monasteries, receiving a higher government subsidy; at the same time, it was obliged to maintain a community of 16 monks, including the superior. This obligation was not respected in practice. The report from 1861 indicated that only six monks and seven lay brothers lived in the monastery, with vacancies for the remaining positions. The exemplary functioning of the monastery was emphasized. Until 1859, the monastery received 300 rubles for the maintenance of the monks and 1,200 rubles for running the school, and from 1859, this sum increased to a total of 3,720 rubles. The increased government subsidy meant that by 1863, the monastery had savings of 5,050 rubles deposited in the bank and could sustain itself from the interest.\nIn 1862, a school of icon painting was also organized in the monastery, but the period of its operation is not established. Hieromonk Palladius served as the iconography teacher, and in the first year of the school's operation, 13 students from the general school run by the monastery attended. According to Father Żeleźniakowicz, the courses in icon painting did not last long, as there are no mentions of them in documents from 1868 onwards.\nDuring the January Uprising, a Polish insurgent unit entered the monastery, searching for money. The insurgents disrupted the course of the evening service and destroyed part of the furnishings of the Church of St. Onuphrius. However, thanks to the intervention of the local Catholic priest, the unit withdrew without causing major damage to the monastery.\nIn 1863, the monastery was inhabited by 10 monks and 8 lay brothers. The school they ran had 38 students, 14 of whom were of the Catholic faith.\n\n\n==== 1875–1915 ====\n\nIn 1875, the monastery housed 10 monks and 6 lay brothers. This number only experienced slight fluctuations until the end of the decade. After the administrative abolition of the last diocese of the Uniate Church in the Russian Empire, carried out by the tsarist administration and the military in 1875, the entire activity of the monastery was subordinated to the goal of consolidating Orthodoxy in Chełm Land. Upon explicit orders from the tsarist authorities, the monks undertook a broader social and missionary work among the local Catholic population and former Uniates, expanding the already existing school from their own funds and admitting 50 people in 1880. After 1889, they also ran a school for psalmists for newly established Orthodox parishes in the region. Candidates for teachers in parish schools were trained in a separate facility. Previously, the monastery clergy did not participate in the policy of Russification. The monks made significant contributions to the development of education among the rural population of the region. Thanks to the efforts of Archimandrite Narcyz in 1862, they obtained an increase in the subsidy for the school's operation, which allowed them to admit 62 children to study from 1881.\nFrom 1876 to 1880, further expansion and renovation of the monastery were carried out, including the construction of a two-story residential building for the monks. In the 1880s, the Bug river's course was also changed, resulting in the monastery being situated on the left bank of the river. Thanks to tsarist grants, it owned a landed estate – 1,207.51 dessiatins, including arable land, pastures, and forests.\nIn 1881, Archbishop Leoncjusz of Warsaw appealed to the Most Holy Synod to classify the Jabłeczna monastery among the first-class monasteries due to its historical and contemporary significance. In the same year, the Jabłeczna community consisted of 9 monks and 23 lay brothers. In January 1882, this request was positively considered. In 1886, the monastery was inhabited by nine monks and a \"significant number\" of lay brothers. The superior, Archimandrite Narcyz, enjoyed considerable spiritual authority among the local population. However, by 1896, in a letter to the Most Holy Synod, Bishop Flawian of Lublin claimed that the monastery, as a missionary center (and therefore, a planned center of Russification), did not meet the hopes placed in it: the community consisted of only nine monks, which did not allow it to strengthen the monastery's authority. Local faithful only attended the monastery for worship on its major holidays, and the poverty of the community discouraged potential monk candidates. Flawian concluded that the monastery had no influence on the local population, including former Uniates, whom it was supposed to solidify in Orthodoxy. According to Father Żeleźniakowicz's assessment, such a significant decline in the monastery was the result of the incompetence of its superior, Archimandrite Joannicius, who arrived in Jabłeczna in 1887 after the death of Archimandrite Narcyz, as well as the lack of support for the monastery from the Chełm-Warsaw Eparchy. In 1896, the school run by the monks was moved from the monastery buildings to new facilities in the village of Jabłeczna. The monastery's situation began to improve after Archimandrite German (Ivanov) assumed the position of superior in 1897. His efforts to strengthen the monastery's role in the social life of Chełm Land were limited by the fact that the monks from Jabłeczna were poorly educated, and their number did not increase. The archimandrite opened an orphanage, a soup kitchen for the poorest, and an outpatient clinic. By managing the monastery's income well, he also improved its financial situation. This translated into the number of candidates willing to join the monastery – in 1899, the monastery housed 39 monks and lay brothers (for comparison, there were 12 monks in 1889, and nine in 1896). However, those joining the monastery were primarily peasants with education levels that did not allow them to participate in missionary activities in line with the policies of the tsarist authorities. Despite this, the monastery's prestige significantly increased, and it became an important pilgrimage center. Archbishop Hieronymus (Ekziemplarski) of Chełm and Warsaw praised Archimandrite German's work in 1900. German (Ivanov) died after a short illness in 1903; his successor, Archimandrite Arkadiusz (Wielmożyn), due to his advanced age, did not continue his predecessor's social activities on the same scale.\nFrom 1905, the monastery belonged to the newly established Chełm Eparchy. Given the fact that the same year's tolerant decree led to the conversion of approximately 180–200 thousand former Uniates from the Orthodox Church to Roman Catholicism, the Jabłeczna monastery was assigned an even greater role in promoting Orthodoxy and Russian identity. However, Bishop Eulogius of Chełm, particularly involved in promoting Orthodoxy in Chełm Land and Russification activities, argued that the monastery was unable to fulfill the tasks set before it. He emphasized especially that there were no clerics with secondary education among the monks. Therefore, in 1906, there were considerations to close the monastery due to its failure to fulfill its tasks. Ultimately, the Most Holy Synod recognized that the oldest functioning monastic community in Podlasie should remain active and, after reorganization, could play its designated role as a center of Orthodoxy and Russian identity. Therefore, a new superior, Archimandrite Joseph Petrovykh, was appointed, and he was tasked with renewing the monastery's internal life. Upon his arrival in Jabłeczna, Archimandrite Joseph reorganized the monastery school. He also revitalized the declining monastery farm. In 1908, approximately 100 people were studying there.\nOn the night of August 5–6, 1906, the monastery was attacked by unknown armed perpetrators, but it did not suffer significant losses. In 1907, it housed 16 monks and 19 lay brothers.\nIn 1907, after Archimandrite Joseph was delegated to serve in Novgorod, the community elected Archimandrite Seraphim (Ostroumov) as his successor. Until then, superiors were appointed from above by the synod. In this case, in January of the following year, it merely confirmed the decision of the monks.\nIn 1913, the community consisted of 80 monks and lay brothers, and in 1914, it decreased to 68. The St. Onuphrius Monastery also opened its branches. In 1909, on an island in Lake Białe, the skete of the Holy Sergius and Herman of Valaam was established. The construction of the skete, which included a wooden church and a house for the monks, cost 50,000 rubles. Since 1912, the monks took care of the church of St. Nicholas in Dratów. The monastery complex itself was also expanded: a chapel of the Meeting of the Lord (now dedicated to the Holy Spirit) was built on the site where, according to legend, the icon of St. Onuphrius was found, and opposite the monastery gate, the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God was erected. A two-ton bell cast in Moscow was placed in the main monastery church. From 1906 to 1910, another renovation of the monastery buildings was carried out. As part of this renovation, Ivan Wolski adorned the Church of St. Onuphrius with frescoes. The solemn consecration of the renovated temple took place on 16 December 1907, in a ceremony attended by bishops Andronik Nikolsky and Tryphon Turkestanov.\nIn 1911, in addition to the existing monastery school, the monks opened a two-class school in the village of Otoki, where 62 children studied, and a lower one-class school in Jabłeczna, intended for 60 people. In the same year, a vocational school was established, attended by about 50 people. The institution's program included practical courses in agriculture, gardening, veterinary medicine, forestry, dairy farming, and beekeeping. The establishment of these schools was associated with the promotion of Orthodoxy through the monks' social activities. In 1914, the last year of the monastery's operation in the established form after 1875, 431 people were studying in all the schools run by them. Additionally, in 1912, 1,760 people benefited from free medicines issued at the monastery pharmacy, and in 1913, 4,500 free meals were distributed. The monastic way of life was based on the rule of St. Basil the Great with elements of specific traditions drawn from the Optina Monastery, the Sarov Monastery, and the monasteries of Kyiv. The period of the monastery's final years of operation in Tsarist Russia, as Father Żeleźniakowicz called it, was its golden age. The monastery once again became an important pilgrimage center.\nOn 22 December 1914, a fire broke out in the monastery, completely destroying the building housing the pharmacy and the outpatient clinic.\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nOn 1 August 1915, most of the monks, except for Hieromonk Hiob (Dyczko), went into exile, taking with them the icon of St. Onuphrius. They reached Moscow and settled in the Epiphany Monastery, where they were received by Bishop Tryphon (Turkiestanov), who had visited Jabłeczna several times before. After the German troops entered the Chełm region (two days after the monks' departure), the monastery buildings were taken over for military purposes, and Hieromonk Hiob was arrested.\nThe monks returned to Jabłeczna in 1918 or 1919. The first to arrive at the monastery was Hieromonk Mitrofan (Stelmaszuk), and on 20 September 1919, the superior, Archimandrite Sergius (Korolow), returned. The monastery was devastated and in need of reconstruction. In the early years of the monastery's existence in independent Poland, its activities were limited by local authorities. In September 1919, the Church of St. Onuphrius was closed, and the parish church in Jabłeczna, as Uniate property, was handed over to the Catholic Church. Additionally, the Catholic diocese of Siedlce and the parish priest of the Catholic parish in Sławatycze took actions for the complete liquidation of the monastery. Inspired by them, the local population gathered at rallies demanding its closure. The parish in Sławatycze, without a proper court ruling, also took over most of the monastery's lands. In 1922, Polish authorities expelled the monastery's superior, Bishop Sergius (Korolow) of Bielsko, who as a monk had been involved in strengthening Orthodoxy in the Chełm region and had opposed the autocephaly of the Orthodox Church in Poland after 1918. In 1920, after intervention by representatives of the Orthodox Church in the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, the monks regained the Church of St. Onuphrius. During its closure, part of its equipment was looted and transferred to the church in Jabłeczna. The monks also regained the church in Dratów.\nIn 1924, the number of monks living in the monastery was limited to four, and the land taken from the local Catholics was officially confiscated. Throughout the interwar period, there was talk of liquidating the monastery and deploying a military unit in its buildings. In 1921, the governor of Lublin appealed for the closure of the monastery, accusing the monks of anti-state activities. In the same year, most of the monastery buildings were awarded to the Catholic parish in Jabłeczna, with Orthodox being allowed to keep only 30 morgen of land and \"necessary premises\". However, the state abandoned support for further claims by the Catholic Church against the monastery (still pursued in 1929) after receiving convincing documents from the Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, indicating that the monastery had never belonged to Catholics. The monastery also failed to obtain permission to operate a parish due to the opinion of the Biała Podlaska starosta, who cited the past involvement of Orthodox clergy in the Russification of the Chełm region.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, a shelter for Orthodox children, relocated from Otwock, operated in Jabłeczna near the monastery. Throughout its existence, the monks remained in conflict with its director, Aleksei Tarasov, who hindered the monks from using the monastery's premises and inventory. In 1927, desiring to carry out renovation of the monastery, Metropolitan Dionysius of Warsaw and All Poland requested a subsidy of 5,000 złoty from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, which he did not receive due to a negative opinion from the Lublin governor submitted at the ministry's request. The renovation was ultimately carried out without state assistance in the 1930s and involved some of the monastery buildings.\nIn 1929, the monks from Jabłeczna ran a home for retired Orthodox clergy in the monastery. Since 1934, they also organized two-year courses for psalmists, and since 1936, for deacons, and shortly before the outbreak of World War II, they opened a religious teacher training institute. In the 1930s, the monastery's superiors planned to make educational and charitable activities the main focus of its social work.\nIn 1929, the monastery was inhabited by nine monks. By 1935, this number had increased to fifteen. They were mostly Ukrainians or Belarusians. Throughout the interwar period, the monastery faced serious financial problems. Revenues from leasing land to local peasants, running a farm, donations from the faithful, candle sales, and sales from the monastery shop were so low that in the 1920s the monastery was in debt, and in the 1930s, it achieved a favorable financial balance thanks to the help of central management bodies of the Polish Orthodox Church. To improve their situation, the monks were forced to sell the Skete of Saints Sergius and Herman on Lake Białe in 1925, which was acquired by the Orthodox parish in Omielce.\nIn the late 1930s, the monastery complex consisted of four churches (two chapels, the Church of St. Onuphrius, the domestic chapel of St. John the Theologian), the superior's house, a brick residential building, a pilgrim house, a granary, a stable, three cowsheds, a house in the orchard, and a devastated residential building, the renovation of which was not carried out due to lack of funds. The monastery library contained 1,319 volumes, of which a thousand were on religious topics and 319 secular.\n\n\n=== World War II and the early post-war years ===\n\nAfter the Nazi aggression on Poland in 1939, the monastery in Jabłeczna fell within the borders of the General Government. The Bug river served as the border between the General Government and the Soviet Union until 1941, so a German military guardhouse was stationed on the monastery grounds. During the night of August 9–10, 1942, the Germans set fire to the main monastery buildings, destroyed the furnishings of the church, the library, and the archives, and murdered Monk Ignatius (Bazyluk). After this event, most of the monks, except for the oldest, were directed by church authorities to pastoral work in the still-active parishes in the region. In 1945, the monastery was attacked by a Polish underground unit.\nAs a result of the deportations of the Ukrainian population to the USSR, and later the Operation Vistula, the number of Orthodox Ukrainians living in the Chełm region decreased almost to zero. Consequently, most of the parishes of the Polish Orthodox Church in the region were also liquidated. Bishop Timothy (Szretter), who agreed with this decision of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, managed the Orthodox structures in the Lublin Voivodeship and requested not to close the monastery in Jabłeczna. Up to that point, five monks had managed to return to the monastery. On 10 August 1946, Father Włodzimierz Wieżański arrived from Warsaw, appealing to the local population for help in rebuilding and maintaining the monastery. Ultimately, Bishop Timothy's request was fulfilled, although the opposite scenario was also considered. However, the monastery lost all its remaining land in 1950 (to the Koroszczyn State Agricultural Farm) and its inventory, thereby losing its economic basis for functioning. In 1951, it only had an orchard and a garden; the remaining fragment of arable land was so small that the State Agricultural Farm had to help feed the monks, having taken over most of its land. Until the 1970s, there were three monks in the monastery, and a dozen people attended services at the parish church. By the late 1950s, after Archimandrite Eulogius (Horbowiec) took over as acting superior of the monastery, the provisional reconstruction of the buildings after the war damage was completed. In 1953, the monastery was returned the icons of St. Onuphrius and the Jabłeczna Icon of the Mother of God taken away in 1915. The development of the community, or even its reconstruction in its pre-war form, was impossible because there were no new candidates applying to the monastery, and the other monks were elderly. Additionally, in 1955, the acting superior, Hegumen (later Archimandrite) Eulogius, complained about the low moral standards of the monks, including cases of alcoholism. These allegations were confirmed by a metropolitan commission appointed to inspect the monastery. In 1957, the insufficient number of monks living in the monastery did not even allow for the performance of a full cycle of daily services.\nIn 1962, the monastery was inhabited by three monks and three lay workers. The total income of the monastery amounted to 59,197 złotys, and expenses were 57,000 złotys. Despite all the problems, the monastery maintained prestige among the Orthodox faithful in Poland.\n\n\n=== 1970–1989 ===\n\nOn 8 February 1970, Archimandrite Sawa Hrycuniak became the abbot of the monastery. He completed renovation works in the monastery and then facilitated the relocation of the higher classes of the Orthodox Theological Seminary in Warsaw, which operated in the monastery from 1974 to 1992. The period of Archimandrite Sawa's administration marked a time of actual revival for the community. In the 1980s, the monastery complex was expanded with an additional wing. During this period, the monastery once again became a pilgrimage center.\nFrom 1984 to 1987, only one monk resided in the monastery.\nIn 1989, the Orthodox Diocese of Lublin and Chełm was established. For two years, its headquarters was located in the Jabłeczna monastery.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nOn the night of September 21–22, 1990, the monastery was robbed of the icon of St. Onuphrius and the Jabłeczna Icon of the Mother of God. The monastery regained them in August 1994 after paying a ransom of $10,000. The images were again placed in the monastery church on September 4 and 5, 1994, and to commemorate this event, a local holiday of the recovery of the icons of St. Onuphrius and the Mother of God was established, celebrated on the first Sunday of September. In the same year, a diocesan museum was established in the monastery. The monks run a farm, beekeeping, and produce church candles.\nIn 1995, the monastery housed 15 monks. Four years later, it obtained the status of stauropegion and came under the direct administration of the metropolitans of Warsaw and all Poland.\nIn 2016, a thorough renovation of the domestic church of St. John the Theologian was carried out. After the completion of the work, the temple was consecrated on 18 September 2016 by Metropolitan Sawa.\nIn 2022, there were six monks living in the monastery.\n\nThe goals of the community's activities are formulated as follows:Prayer and work, meditation, and maintaining and strengthening the Orthodox faith in the Podlasie region.\n\n\n== Superiors of the monastery ==\n\nDue to the incomplete preservation of the monastery's archive, not all the personal details of the superiors of the Jabłeczna monastery are known. The first known superior of the community by name was Cyril (Mancewicz), who held office in 1527. The next leader of the monastery, Hegumen Kasjan, is mentioned in 1591. Exact dates of office are known for the clergy directing the monastery after 1747.\nThe superiors of the Jabłeczna monastery before 1832 usually held the title of hegumen (except for the monk Jan, who temporarily came from Kyiv in 1770). From the mentioned year, when Joannicjusz (Mosakowski) became the superior, until World War II, they typically received the title of archimandrite. After World War II, due to material and personnel difficulties of the monastery, it was managed by acting superiors until 1955, one of whom, Father Mikołaj Smolski, was a widowed priest without monastic vows.\nSince the monastery was granted the status of stauropegion, its titular head has always been the Metropolitan of Warsaw and All Poland, who appoints a deputy to effectively lead the community. From 15 October 2019, this role has been filled by Hieromonk, later Hegumen, then Archimandrite Peter (Dawidziuk).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe main monastery church is dedicated to St. Onuphrius. It was built in the years 1838–1840 in the shape of a Greek cross. This structure consists of three parts: a church porch, a nave, and a chancel, with a single dome supported by four piers. The interior of the building is adorned with a series of frescoes, and it also houses a three-tier iconostasis by Vasiliy Lojka and Feliks Skulimowski. At the entrance to the church from the left wing, there is the tomb of one of the superiors of the monastery, Archimandrite Narcyz (Silwiestrow).\nAdjacent to the church is the bell tower.\nDuring the winter months, the role of the main monastery temple is taken over by the domestic church of St. John the Theologian, located in one of the brick buildings of the monastery. It contains a single-tier iconostasis from the early 20th century. The interior of this church is decorated with polychrome paintings executed in 2016 by Natalia Oniśko from Białystok. Additionally, the chapel of St. Athanasius of Brest is located in the renovated refectory building.\nOutside the monastery wall, there are two wooden chapels from the early 20th century: the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God and the Holy Spirit. The former is built in a rectangular plan, while the latter is in the shape of a cross; both are covered with sheet metal and topped with onion domes (the former has five, the latter one). Under the roof of the chapels, there is only the sanctuary space – during services, the faithful gather outside, facing the buildings. The chapel of the Dormition of the Mother of God houses a single-tier iconostasis made in Moscow, and the rest of the church's furnishings consist of 12 icons.\nThe monastery complex in Jabłeczna was entered into the heritage registers on 12 March 1966 (again on 18 August 1972, and 19 April 1985) under number A/14. On 2 February 2023, it was included in the list of historic monuments.\n\n\n== Icons ==\n\nParticularly revered among the Orthodox faithful in Poland are the Jabłeczna Icon of the Mother of God and the icon of St. Onuphrius, kept in the iconostasis of the main church. The image of the monastery's patron saint, according to art historians, dates back to between the 12th and 13th centuries. It was painted on a cypress wood panel with a chalk underlay. St. Onuphrius is depicted standing, wearing only a loincloth, with a gray beard reaching below the knees. In the background, the outline of the landscape along the Bug river can be seen. The dimensions of the icon are 112 by 75 cm.\nThe Jabłeczna Icon of the Mother of God is also dated to the 12th–13th centuries. It portrays Mary with the Child Jesus held in her left hand, while her right hand points to Him. Beside them are the figures of the archangels Gabriel and Michael. The frame of the icon is formed by the figures of Old Testament prophets foretelling the coming of the Savior. Therefore, this image is also known as the Fulfillment of Prophetic Predictions.\nFrom 1990 to 2010, a copy of the Turkowice Icon of the Mother of God, considered miraculous, was kept in the monastery. In 2010, it was transferred to the female monastery in Turkowice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJadczak, Stanisław; Zugaj, Zbigniew (1992). Monaster w Jabłecznej.

        "content": "Who Invited Them is an American horror film directed by Duncan Birmingham and starrying Ryan Hansen, Melissa Tang, Timothy Granaderos. The film was released on Shudder on September 1, 2022 to a critical success.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA married couple, Adam and Margo, buys a large, expensive house in a prestigious area. Although Margot thinks that such a place is too posh for them, Adam still throws a housewarming party to show off to his colleagues and superiors. When the guests have already left, the hosts suddenly discover an unfamiliar couple in the house. Profuse in apologies and compliments, they present themselves as wealthy neighbors who came to quarrel over parking slots but changed their minds about spoiling the event. Adam and Margo's child spends the night with friends, so they decide to continue the evening in the company of new acquaintances who are, in fact, duplicitous and dangerous impostors.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRyan Hansen as Adam\nMelissa Tang as Margo\nTimothy Granaderos as Tom\nPerry Mattfeld as Sasha\nTipper Newton as Teeny\nBarry Rothbart as Frank\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film has a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews.\nSimon Abrams of RogerEbert.com wrote, \"A Hollywood Hills housewarming party eventually turns deadly in “Who Invited Them,” a staid home invasion thriller about a timid married couple who are bullied by two flirtatious strangers. More experienced—or funnier, or more exploitation-adept—filmmakers might have at least hit the mark for shock value in this ostensibly psycho-satirical button-pusher.\" Michelle Swope of Bloody Disgusting! commented, \"Either way, from beginning to end, Who Invited Them is a blast, a party you won’t want to be over, and an impressive directorial debut.\" Katie Rife of Dread Central mentioned. \"Birmingham does a good job teasing the audience with the possibility of violence, while coyly withholding the orgy of bloodshed that seems sure to explode at some point.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWho Invited Them at IMDb",

        "content": "\"Vivere tutte le vite\" (in Italian, \"Living all the lives\") is a song by Italian singers Elisa and Carl Brave. It was released by Universal Music Group on 3 May 2019 as the fourth single from Elisa's tenth studio album Diari aperti.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe original version of the song, performed by Elisa alone, is featured on the first version of the album. The song, originally co-written with singer-songwriter Federica Abbate, featured the collaboration of Italian rapper Carl Brave in writing and producing. The singer described the song in an interview with Vanity Fair Italia:\"It is my invitation to look for a little more levity: especially on social media, which, I premise, for me is a beautiful and useful medium, but sometimes we tend to show only a facade, to always make ourselves look super strong, super happy. And all just to try to be liked, to get recognition. I sing that \"I don't want to live every life, I don't want to see every place in the world, win by force.\" A bit of a reminder that we are not super heroes and we are not always enough of ourselves. And that therefore we should not be afraid to show our fragile part, our normal, maybe even \"boring\" part. I would like to invite those who listen to me to pick up a pen, write, rediscover the humanity in ourselves. Machines should help us do things, but always expressing what we are.\"\n\n\n== Critics reception ==\nReviewing the Diari aperti. for All Music Italia, Fabio Fiume appreciated the \"Jason Mraz-esque guitar that accompanies through to an easygoing aside\" of the song, in which there are \"vocal overlays and background choruses that are so 60s.\" In a less positive review, Mattia Barro of Rolling Stone Italia wrote that the song is not among the most innovative tracks on the album as it is \"less intriguing for its winking at a somewhat outdated period of Italian indie.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video for the song was released on 13 June 13 2019 on Elisa official YouTube channel. The video, directed by the duo YouNuts! was filmed in Rome, between the neighborhoods of Trastevere and Garbatella.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1950.\nIt shows a scene of the artist's impression of catching a Thanksgiving turkey, a subject she returned to many times in her career as an artist of \"old timey\" subjects. It was often in demand as a variation on her popular theme of \"over the river to grandma's house\", which was generally a scene of figures in a horse-drawn sleigh crossing a stream. The figures are in the snow by a shed trying to catch a turkey.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGalerie St. Etienne\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the painting in the 1975 abridged version of Otto Kallir's 1973 catalogue raisonné\nOtto Kallir, Grandma Moses, Complete edition, New York, Harry N.

As the revolutionising carrier to implement both low-cost and charter services, it democratised air travel, making it more accessible to a broader spectrum of travelers in the country.\nFurthermore, the airline pioneered nonstop routes between Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu as well as Kuching, diverging from the standard Malaysia-Singapore Airlines itinerary that required travelers to stopover in Singapore, representing a notable improvement in travel convenience for passengers commuting to and from the Malaysian capital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Inception ===\n\nIn October 1971, Pelandok Airways made its debut in Malaysia's aviation sector through a collaboration between the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) and Taiwan's Far Eastern Air Transport Corporation. During its inception, the airline joined the ranks of Malaysia's three charter companies, alongside Southern Cross Airways and Malaysian Air Charter (MAC).\nOperating with a fleet of two 70-seater Vickers Viscount aircraft, Pelandok Airways spearheaded both charter and budget flights, launching direct routes from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu in January 1972, with subsequent expansion to Kuching by June of the same year. This strategic expansion significantly improved accessibility between East Malaysia and the capital, marking a departure from the traditional Malaysia-Singapore Airlines route that mandated layovers in Singapore.\nPelandok Airways had ambitious expansion strategies in place, with plans to procure additional planes, notably two second-hand 50-seat Handley Page Dart Herald from Taiwan and Silver Kris jets from MSA (Malaysia-Singapore Airlines), the national carrier. Initially, Pelandok Airways granted flight rights to a diverse array of destinations spanning East and West Malaysia, as well as various international locations such as Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Vietnam, Australia and other destinations.\n\n\n=== Regulatory challengers ===\n\nPelandok Airways faced significant challenges in its bid to continue operating as a secondary airline to Malaysian Airline System (MAS). The Ministry of Communication rejected the airline's appeal to renew its air charter permit, which was set to expire in 1972. Mr. On Boon Bah, the airline's secretary, announced the Ministry's decision, stating that they had no choice but to cease operations.\nThe Ministry's decision stemmed from several restrictions imposed on Pelandok Airways. The airline was informed that it could not operate charter services to destinations already served by MAS, as seen in the denial of the planned Pelandok Airways flight from Kuala Lumpur to Medan, a route already serviced by the national carrier, despite Pelandok Airways securing prior permission. Additionally, it was also being informed its traffic rights to areas not yet served by MAS would automatically lapse once MAS began operating in those regions.\nThus, following the restructuring of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines into Malaysia Airlines in 1972, MAS prioritized the development of its domestic network. While the introduction of a direct flight from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu and Kuching was deemed necessary by the national carrier, the limited market size in 1972 rendered competition between two airlines on the same route unsustainable.\n\n\n=== Closure ===\nThe closure of Pelandok Airways, following the Ministry of Communication's decision not to renew its air charter permit, marks the end of its operations. This decision, influenced by restrictions regarding overlapping routes with Malaysian Airline System (MAS), resulted in the termination of approximately 50 staff members, including pilots, eight flight attendants and other personnel. This event reflects the intricate regulatory considerations and competitive dynamics in Malaysia's aviation industry during the era.\n\n\n== Branding and corporate identity ==\nThe logo of Pelandok Airways featured the red initials \"PA\" incorporated into a stylized depiction of a black mouse-deer silhouette, honoring the airline's Malay namesake pelandok and uniquely symbolising its identity.\n\n\n== Former Fleet ==\nAs of its closure in July 1972, Pelandok Airways maintained a fleet of two aircraft:\n\n\n== Destinations Served ==\nIn the past, Pelandok Airways offered scheduled flight services to the following destinations:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mark Steven Whiteley (born 1962) is a British consultant venous surgeon known for his contributions to endovenous surgery and venous treatment techniques.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWhiteley was born in Bristol, in 1962. He attended King Edward’s School, Bath, from 1974 to 1981. He then studied at the medical college of St Bartholomew’s Hospital, part of the University of London, graduating in 1986.\n\n\n== Career ==\nProfessor Whiteley trained at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and served as a lecturer in surgery at Oxford University from 1995 to 1998. He was appointed Consultant Vascular Surgeon in 1998.\nIn 1999, Whiteley performed the first endovenous thermal ablation in the UK. In 2001, he developed the TRansLuminal Occlusion of Perforators (TRLOP) technique, leading to the development of the VNUS RFS device.  After presenting this in America in 2004, US-based vascular surgeons began performing the technique, renaming it Percutaneous Ablation of Perforators (PAPS).\nWhiteley is recognized for identifying Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis (EHIT) and introducing the concept of the \"living skeleton\" within vein walls.\nIn 2002, he founded Whiteley Clinic, followed by The College of Phlebology in 2011.\nIn 2013, Whiteley founded the Leg Ulcer Charity in the UK.\nIn 2019, Whiteley performed the endovenous procedure of the Eco Endovenous Microwave Catheter for varicose veins. In the same year, he used the High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Echotherapy (Sonovein) to treat varicose veins non-invasively.\nWhiteley has authored over 100 peer-reviewed papers and written five books covering topics such as venous reflux, leg ulcer treatment, pelvic congestion syndrome, and vein health.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\"Physiological Comparison of Open and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair\". GD Treharne, MM Thompson, MS Whiteley, PRF Bell. Journal of British Surgery, 86(6), 760-764. (1999)\n\"Incompetent perforating veins are associated with recurrent varicose veins\".

        "content": "John Brian Roland Maile (15 October 1926 – 27 October 2004) was a South African cricketer who played first-class cricket for Transvaal and Western Province between 1951–52 and 1960–61.\nMaile was born in Johannesburg and studied there at the University of the Witwatersrand in the 1950s. An all-rounder who batted in the middle or lower order and could bowl either pace or off-spin, he played a few seasons of Currie Cup cricket for Transvaal without conspicuous success before moving to Western Province and establishing himself in the side in 1958–59, when he was one of the leading all-rounders in the country. In 1958–59 he made 408 runs at an average of 40.80 and took 15 wickets at 26.53, and in 1959–60 he made 208 runs at 23.11 and took 28 wickets at 16.92.\nThe 1959–60 season included Maile's best performances. He scored his only first-class century, 108 for Western Province against Border in the opening match of the Currie Cup. Later, in consecutive weeks, he took 1 for 28 and 7 for 27 in the return match against Border,  and then 4 for 91 and 5 for 106 against Transvaal.  He was chosen as one of the South African Cricket Annual Cricketers of the Year in 1960.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Maile at ESPNcricinfo",

        "content": "\n== Australian Defence Force missile procurement ==\n\nThe Australian Defence Force Missile Procurement (unofficial name) is a group of projects currently being undertaken by the Australian Defence Force that attempts to provide Australia with a long-range strike capability, currently in the realm of numerous advanced missiles. This accelerated phase of procurement begun in 2020 when then-Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia would purchase $800m worth of the US-manufactured AGM-158C LRASM anti-ship missile. This was due to the rising tensions with China, as well as the outdated nature of the Harpoon missile, the default anti-ship option for Australia at the time.\nFollowing this, in 2021, Australia abandoned its deal with France to produce Attack-class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy, in favour of AUKUS, a trilateral deal between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom to provide Australia with a nuclear attack submarine capability and jointly design and manufacture the SSN-AUKUS for use by all three nations. As part of Pillar II of AUKUS, the US and Australia will collaborate on various different military technology, the most relevant of which being the SCIFiRE hypersonic missile in joint development between the United States and Australia.\nAustralia plans to domestically manufacture advanced missiles, first with the GMLRS for the M142 HIMARS systems, from 2025, in a $37m deal with Lockheed Martin Australia. Australia plans to manufacture the Precision Strike short-range ballistic missile domestically sometime in the future.\n\n\n== Ballistic Missiles ==\nAustralia ordered MGM-140 ATACMS in 2023. The ATACMS is an American-manufactured tactical ballistic missile that will be compatible with Australian HIMARS systems. The ATACMS is an ageing missile, and as such, Australia has no intent to build them domestically. Australia is a part of the American Precision Strike Missile program, that will provide Australia with a successor to the ATACMS, which will be a short-range ballistic missile. The PrSM has a longer range of between 500 km (for the original variant) and up to 1000 km (for the Increment 3/4) which Australia will also acquire.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Rocket Artillery ==\n\nAustralia has signed a deal with Lockheed Martin Australia to build GMLRS domestically from 2025. The GMLRS is a guided-rocket that can be fired from the HIMARS, with the launcher able to carry and launch 12 of them, as opposed to one ATACMS and two PrSM. The GMLRS has a range of 70 km, and is a cheaper alternative to the former missiles. The extended range variant can reach up to 150 km.\n\n\n== Land Attack Cruise Missiles ==\nAustralia has announced it will procure roughly 200 of the advanced US Tomahawk missile, in a deal worth $1.7bn USD. The Tomahawk is a land-attack cruise missile, with a range of 1,900 km, which Australia plans to launch from its Hobart-class destroyers via their Vertical launching system cells.\nAustralia will also procure the AGM-158 JASSM-ER, a longer range version of the JASSM, a missile already in Australian use. The JASSM-ER has a range of 900 km and is an air-launched cruise missile.\nAustralia is buying the Joint Strike Missile, a Norwegian device that has anti-ship use and land-attack uses.\n\n\n== Hypersonic Missile ==\nSCIFiRE\n\n\n== Anti-ship Missile ==\nAGM-158C LRASM\nNaval Strike Missile\n\n\n== Anti-ballistic Missile ==\nRIM-174 Standard Missile 6 (SM-6)\n\n\n== Anti-radiation Missile ==\nAGM-88 HARM\n\n\n== Launch Vehicles ==\nM142 HIMARS\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Republic of Western Armenia, is a government in exile claiming sovereignty over parts of the Armenian highlands including sections of Western Armenia as well as Nagorno–Karabakh, and Nakhichevan. Also, the self-declared country says it has its own presidency, government, parliament, constitution, national anthem and coat of arms.\n\nThe individuals of the Republic of Western Armenia claim to be the legal successor of the Armenian state recognised by international law in 1920, and therefore internationally recognised.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe presence of Armenians in Anatolia has been documented since the sixth century BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens under the Seljuk dynasty.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, historical Armenia was divided between the Ottomans taking the West and the Safavids taking the East.\nOn the eve of World War I in 1914, around two million Armenians lived in Anatolia out of a total population of 15–17.5 million. According to the Armenian Patriarchate's estimates for 1913–1914, there were 2,925 Armenian towns and villages in the Ottoman Empire, of which 2,084 were in the Armenian highlands in the vilayets of Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzerum, Harput, and Van. Armenians were a minority in most places where they lived, alongside Turkish and Kurdish Muslim and Greek Orthodox Christian neighbors. According to the Patriarchate's figure, 215,131 Armenians lived in urban areas, especially Constantinople, Smyrna, and Eastern Thrace. Although most Ottoman Armenians were peasant farmers, they were overrepresented in commerce. As middleman minorities, despite the wealth of some Armenians, their overall political power was low, making them especially vulnerable. The ethnic cleansing of Armenians during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is widely considered a genocide, The Ottoman Empire massacred approximately 600,000–1,500,000 Armenians. The first wave of persecution was in the years 1894 to 1896, the second one culminating in the events of the Armenian genocide in 1915 and 1916.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn February 4, 2011, the beginning of the process of formation of the Government-in-Exile of Western Armenia was announced (now – the Government of the State of Western Armenia). In November 2013, through direct elections via Internet, the National Assembly (Parliament) of Western Armenia was formed, whose deputies at the first session of the Parliament on January 20, 2014, in Paris, elected the President of Western Armenia.\n\n\n== The claimed lands ==\nThe \"Western Armenia TV\" newscaster introduced cities such as Bitlis, Muş, Van, Mardin, Iğdır, Adana, Trabzon and Rize as \"Western Armenia\" in his news bulletins. Artsakh and Nakhichevan is also claimed lands. The announcer also added that Western Armenia, which was declared an independent and sovereign state in 1920, is now occupied by Turkey. Sooner or later it will return to its true owners, the Armenians,\" he said. Erzurum, which the Armenians call \"Karin\", is claimed as the capital.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSuny, Ronald Grigor (2015).

        "content": "Anasaitis milesae is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae) that was first  discovered in 2023 and formally described in 2024. It represents one of around 50 non-native spider species that have become established in Britain, likely facilitated by global warming providing an increasingly hospitable climate.\n\n\n== History and systematics ==\nThe species was discovered by Tylan Berry during a \"bioblitz\" on the Penryn campus in Cornwall, England, home to the University of Exeter and Falmouth University. Immature and female spiders were first collected on 29 April 2023, adult males on 17 May 2023. It was confirmed as a new species and named by Russian arachnologist Dmitri Logunov of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The specific name milesae honours Claire Miles (1958–2023), a former honorary curator at the Manchester Museum where the holotype is kept.\nLogunov provisionally assigned the species to the genus Anasaitis, based on the diagnostic features of the genitalia of the two sexes. It most resembled three Anasaitis species from the Greater Antilles: A. emertoni, A. peckhami, and A. squamata. However, there were differences from other Anasaitis species, including less differentiation in body colour between males and females.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe spider measures about 3-4 mm in length and has distinctive furry tiger-type brown and cream markings. The holotype male has a carapace about 1.5 mm long by 1.0 mm wide and an abdomen about 1.35 mm long by 0.9 mm wide. The first leg is the longest at about 2.6 mm. The overall base colour of the male is yellowish, with brown markings, including a W-shaped central brown mark on the top of the abdomen accompanied by brown spots, and brown lines and rings on the legs. Its palpal bulb has a relatively long tibial apophysis with a small tooth-like bump at the base. The paratype female is larger, with a carapace about 1.6 mm long by 1.1 mm wide and an abdomen about 1.9 mm long and 1.25 mm wide. The fourth leg is the longest at about 2.9 mm. The female is a similar colour to the male, but paler; the first pair of legs are entirely yellow rather than having partially brown sides.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIts nearest known relatives are found in the Caribbean region, suggesting that A. milesae likely arrived in Britain from distant tropical or subtropical regions through international trade and travel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnasaitis milesae at Worldwide database of jumping spiders\nBBC Wildlife Magazine 2024-03-20: New species!

        "content": "Deiran (Arabic: ديران) is an archaeological site in modern-day Rehovot, Israel.\n\n\n== History ==\nKhirbat Deiran was inhabited during the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, with a major expansion to about 60 dunams during the early centuries of Islamic rule. Archaeologist Buchenino reported possible evidence of Jewish or Samaritan occupation on site during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Klein identified Khirbet Deiran as Kerem Doron (\"vineyard of Doron\"), a place mentioned in Talmud Yerushalmi (Peah 7:4), but Fischer believes that there is \"no special reason\" for this identification, while Kalmin is unsure whether Doron was a place or a person.\nDuring the Ottoman period the area was inhabited by the Sawtariyya Arabs, who used to inhabit the site in tents with their flocks.\n\n\n== Jewish settlement ==\nRehovot was founded as a moshava on Deiran's lands in 1890 by Polish Jewish immigrants who had come with the First Aliyah, seeking to establish a township which would not be under the influence of the Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, on land which was purchased from a Christian Arab by the Menuha Venahala society, an organization in Warsaw that raised funds for Jewish settlement in Eretz Israel.\nThe once \"abandoned or sparsely populated\" estate, now lied in the center of the built-up area of the Rehovot. According to Marom, Deiran offered \"a convenient launching pad for early land purchase initiatives which shaped the pattern of Jewish settlement until the beginning of the British Mandate\".\nIn March 1892, a dispute over pasture rights erupted between the residents of Rehovot and the neighboring village of Zarnuqa, which took two years to resolve. Another dispute broke out with the Suteriya Bedouin tribe, which had been cultivating some of the land as tenant farmers. According to Moshe Smilansky, one of the early settlers of Rehovot, the Bedouins had received compensation for the land, but refused to vacate it. In 1893, they attacked the moshava. Through the intervention of a respected Arab sheikh, a compromise was reached, with the Sautariyya Bedouins receiving an additional sum of money, which they used to dig a well.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Poulton & Wyre Railway Society (PWRS) is a railway preservation company based in Lancashire, England. Formed in 2006, its main focus has been working towards reinstating the railway line between Poulton-le-Fylde and Fleetwood (part of the Preston and Wyre Railway) for passenger use. The line was taken out of use in 1970.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPoulton & Wyre Railway Society was formed in 2008, after a merger between Wyre Rail Cycle Partnership and a heritage railway group.\nIn 2007, the society obtained a non-operational lease from Network Rail for a section of line between the former Thornton for Cleveleys station in Thornton Centre and Hillylaid Road, a short distance to the north. The main aim was to clear the station's extant platforms of vegetation. This was achieved.\nNetwork Rail upgraded the lease to a clearance licence the following year, and extended its coverage to the entire line between Poulton-le-Fylde and Jameson Road in Fleetwood.\nIn 2010, PWRS were given a three-year lease for Thornton for Cleveleys station. Lancashire County Council (LCC) supported the scheme. A £30,000 feasibility study was undertaken to explore the re-instatement of the link and the addition of a third platform at Poulton-le-Fylde station.\nHighway England granted a licence to the society in 2015 to allow access to the line between the Wyre Way footpath and the A585 Amounderness Way.\nIn 2019, a motion requesting a feasibility study into the restoration was rejected by Wyre Council. This followed LCC's denial of £50,000 in funding the previous week.\nOn 28 February 2020, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an unannounced visit to the Thornton station during the country's election campaign, and three months before the 50th anniversary of the last passengers arriving there. He invited local councillor Brian Crawford onto the tracks for a private word. When Johnson asked what Crawford needed, he replied that £100,000 was necessary for an initial feasibility study. Johnson granted the request, and said he wanted the station to reopen before the next election, which was due in 2024. The line was one of several chosen as part of a policy to \"Reverse Beeching\" (see Beeching cuts).\nThe study, completed in 2021, found that the line could be reopened for heavy rail, to integrate with the national rail network. It confirmed it could also be used for 'light' rail, as an extension of the Blackpool Tramway route, or as a hybrid system, using vehicles which could operate on both heavy- and light-rail systems. The study also found that reopening the link would propose an 11-minute journey from Fleetwood to Poulton, and 28 minutes from Fleetwood to Preston. A journey which currently takes an hour by public transport.\nIn 2022, plans to reinstate the railway line between Poulton-le-Fylde and Fleetwood were approved by Parliament, with the Department for Transport agreeing to fund the project.\nThe society, having completed a full restoration of Thornton for Cleveleys station, has now begun work to clear vegetation and restore the disused platform at Burn Naze Halt, 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Thornton for Cleveleys, as part of their ambition to restore most of the line for heritage trains. The former Burn Naze station is located within the Hillhouse Enterprise Zone (part of the former ICI Hillhouse site, which was in operation between 1941 and 1992). It is possible that the station could be relocated to nearby Butts Close in Burn Naze, where there is space for a potential car park. PWRS moved its headquarters to the Hillhouse Enterprise Zone, having been given a plot of land by NPL Group.\nIn 2023, an 1890 Lancashire and Yorkshire Victorian railway carriage body was acquired by the society from Raikes Farmhouse in Thornton.\nPlans for a Heritage Railway Centre, with a museum, offices, workshop and a test track, are underway.\n\n\n== Locomotives ==\nThe society has purchased and restored a John Fowler shunter from Leyland Motors, as well as two Class 108 diesel multiple units (DMU), which are also being restored. One is a trailer car, the other is power car.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nThe society's president between 2018 and 2024 was Eddie Fisher. As of 2022, its chairman is Bill Eccles. The Labour Party's Cat Smith is a PWRS member.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "John Springate is an English singer, musician, songwriter and music producer. The hits he has composed include \"Don't Make Promises (You Can't Keep)\" by the G. Band, \"Don't Play that Song Again\" for Nicki French which was also a Eurovision Song Contest 2000 song and \"Nothing But Promises\" for Kelly. He produced the single \"A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind\" and the Let's Boogie album for Shakin' Stevens. He also played backup for Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon and was a member of Clem Curtis & The Foundations and The Glitter Band.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSpringate married Lyn Barnes a 25 year old bank secretary in 1976.\nSix songs that Springate has composed or com-composed have charted nationally in the UK.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nClem Curtis & the Foundations etc.\nIn the early period of his career, John Springate played with Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon and was a member of Clem Curtis & The Foundations. His brother Bill was also a member of Clem Curtis & The Foundations.\n\nThe Glitter Band\nWith the Clem Curtis & the Foundations period behind him he answered an ad for a bass player. According to Alwyn Turner, the previous bass player had been sacked. Springate auditioned and got the job.\nHe sang lead on the Glitter Band single \"The Tears I Cried\" which Gerry Shephard wrote. It was released in March 1975.\nAn article appeared in the April 24, 1976 issue of Record Mirror. It was about the Glitter Band deciding to change their name to the G. Band. They were no longer using previous name for recording or when performing live. Springate denied that it was to break away from the image of Gary Glitter. He said that so many people were calling them the G. Band and that they decided to shorten it. \nWith Gerry Shephard he co-wrote \"Don't Make Promises (You Can't Keep)\" for the G. Band. It was released on Bell 1481 in 1976. It got to no. 51 on the UK Singles Chart that year.\n\n\n=== 1980s to 1990s ===\nTogether with Mike Leander he produced \"A Little Boogie Woogie (In the Back of My Mind)\" which was recorded by Shakin' Stevens and released in 1987. He and Leander  also co-produced Stevens' album  Let's Boogie which was released the same year.\nHe wrote and produced Kelly Wilde's single, \"Nothing But Promises\" which was released on BOLTS 15/7 in March, 1988. On the week of May 14, 1988, the record debuted in the HI-NRG chart at no. 47.\nSpringate approached Nicki French about recording a version of \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\". She turned down his offer as she regarded the Bonnie Tyler version a classic. He managed to get her onside and produced the early version of the song. It was later recorded by Stock and Aitken.\nDaniel Amalm recorded his composition \"Honey Dip\" which became a hit for Amalm in 1997. It got to no. 88 on the UK chart.\nHe produced \"Let It Swing\" / \"Love in The 1st\" for Sushi which was released on Branded BRAND 11 in 1998. The song made its debut at no. 23 on the RM Pop Chart on the week of October 17.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nWith Gerry Shephard, he wrote the song \"Don't Play That Song Again\" which was Nicki French's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs - John Springate",

        "content": "Harry Stanley Hawley (17 May 1867 – 13 June 1916) was an English pianist and a composer who specialised in recitation melodramas for speaker and piano.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHawley was born at 61 South Street, Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the son of a butcher, who died before his son's first birthday. Stanley won a scholarship to attend Derby Grammar School. At the age of 15 he was appointed organist at the Independent Chapel in Pimlico, Ilkeston. In 1883 he began studying at the Royal Academy of Music in London, supported by a further scholarship. His teachers there included Arthur O'Leary and Ebenezer Prout.\n\n\n== Performer and composer ==\nHawley rapidly established himself as an accompanist and soloist, making his debut at the St James's Hall in 1887. According to Eric Coates Grieg, during one of his visits to London in the late 1880s, heard the student Hawley play his Piano Concerto and praised his performance, though the facts and exact date of this often repeated anecdote have since been disputed. In 1890 he was the first to receive the medal of the Worshipful Company of Musicians and in the same year he performed for Queen Victoria at Osborne House (her summer residence) on the Isle of Wight. He performed recitals with violist Lionel Tertis and the baritone David Ffrangcon-Davies in the UK, Europe and the USA. He toured with the Italian opera singer Adelina Patti in 1906. Hawley was also an examiner and editor of piano music for educational and home use.\nAs a composer two of Hawley's compositions - The Bells, and Riding Through the Broom - were performed in the first season of Henry Wood's Proms in 1895. These were two from a series of at least 25 recitation pieces for speaker and piano. Others included Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight (1895), The Raven and The Thin Red Line (1896), Elizabethan Love Lyrics (1903) and Dramatic Poems, published by Novello in 1905.  Withdraw not Thou Thy Mercy is an anthem for chorus and organ, composed in 1916. He also composed piano music and songs.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nWhile in London Hawley lived at 19 Oxford Mansions (now demolished), a very central flat close to Oxford Circus. He was appointed musical director of the Kingsway Theatre in London, was Secretary to the Royal Philharmonic Society, and became a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. A portrait of Stanley by Frank Mura is on display at the academy.\nWhen Hawley developed a blood clot on the brain he returned to Ilkeston, where he died at his sister's house on Derby Road at the age of 49. A memorial concert was held at the Wigmore Hall on 25 October 1917 conducted by Henry Wood, where his friend Lena Ashwell, a long-time musical partner from the academy and the Kingsway Theatre, performed some of his recitatives.\nIn 1996 Hawley's musical melodramas were revived by actress Pamela Hunter accompanied by Koen Kessels in the first public performances for nearly 80 years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStanley Hawley on German wikipedia\nThe Bells, performed by Pamela Hunter and Koen Kessels\nStanley Hawley scores at IMSLP\nPortrait of Stanley Hawley by Frank Mura, ArtUK",

        "content": "Mary Stillman Harkness or Mary Harkness (1874 – 1950) was an American art collector and noted philanthropist.\nHarkness was the daughter of a prominent New York lawyer. Her mother was the heiress of several generations of Connecticut farmers. She married Edward Harkness in 1904, the wealthy heir of an early investor in Standard Oil. Two years later she was involved in a car accident with her father, who did not survive. Perhaps that is why the couple did not have children, but they continued philanthropic work that Edward had started before their marriage. After his early death in 1940 she spent the rest of her life making donations to various institutions until her death in 1950.\nHarkness died in New York City and her will divided her wealth and property in various places she had frequented with her family. She is best known for Harkness Memorial State Park, where her summer home Eolia, which the couple bought from Mary's sister Jessie and her brother-in-law, William Ambrose Taylor in 1907, preserves the memory of her work. Harkness supported the founding of Connecticut College as a women's college in 1911, after Wesleyan University decided it would admit only men, and she made a number of significant gifts to the college in the 1930s. Wesleyan did not admit women until 1976.\nMary Harkness was a member of the American Museum of Natural History, New York Botanical Garden, the Garden Club of America, the English-speaking Union, and New York Philharmonic Society.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nart collecting record at the Frick",

A Crusader source from 1133 CE states that the Count of Jaffa granted the land to the Hospitaller order, including “the mills of the three bridges” (“des moulins des trios ponts”).\nIn 1478 CE (AH 883), the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, Qaitbay, endowed a quarter of the  revenues of Mulabbes to two newly established institutions: Madrasa Al-Ashrafiyya in Jerusalem, and a mosque in Gaza.\n\n\n== Ottoman period ==\nDavid Grossman suggest that Mulabbes was \"Milus\", a village with 42 Muslim households, mentioned in the Ottoman tax records in 1596.\n\"Melebbes\" appears on Jacotin's map drawn up during Napoleon's invasion in 1799, and shows up as \"el Mulebbis\" on Kiepert's map of Palestine, published in 1856. \nFollowing the invasion of the Levant by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt (1831-1841), the village was repopulated by Egyptian emigrants belonging to the Abu Hamed al-Masri clan as part of a wider wave of migration that settled in Palestine's coastal lowlands.\nIn 1870, Victor Guérin noted that \"Melebbes\" was a small village with 140 inhabitants, surrounded by fields of watermelon and tobacco. An Ottoman village list from about the same year showed that \"Mulebbes\" had 43 houses and a population of 125, though the population count included men only. It was also noted that the village was located on a hill, \"Auf einer Anhöhe\", 2.75 hours northeast of Jaffa.\nThe Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine visited \"Mulebbis\" in 1874 and  described it as \"a similar mud village [as Al-Mirr], with a well.\" Following the sale of Mulabbes' lands to Jewish entrepreneurs, its residents dispersed in neighboring villages like Jaljulia and Fajja.\nIn 1878, Jewish colonist purchased the land of Mulabbes, establishing the first Jewish moshava, Petah Tikvah.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bluffton expedition, also called the burning of Bluffton, was an engagement of the American Civil War in which Union forces destroyed most of Bluffton, South Carolina.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the Union victory at the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861, Confederate Brigadier-General Thomas F. Drayton directed the evacuation of forces from Hilton Head Island to the Bluffton mainland. Occupying Port Royal Harbor, the Union's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron could then be monitored by Confederate lookouts dispersed from Bluffton's substantial picket headquarters. Bluffton's location (on the May River, South Carolina, a stream emptying into the Calibogue) made it the only strategic position on the East Coast from which the Confederates could gather direct intelligence on the Union squadron that was conducting crucial blockade operations along the southern coastline. \n\n\n== The expedition ==\nOn June 3, 1863, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont ordered Lieutenant Commander George Bacon to proceed with the Commodore McDonough on an expedition against Bluffton. On June 4, the army forces under Colonel Barton were landed by the gunboat Mayflower and an army transport, under the protection of the Commodore McDonough, and took possession of the town, the Confederates having retreated. By the order of Colonel Barton, the town was mostly destroyed by fire, although the church was spared; and though the Confederate troops made several charges, they were driven back by the Union troops, and the shells and shrapnel of the Commodore McDonough. Bluffton being destroyed, the soldiers reembarked without casualties, and returned to Hilton Head. \nThe Union forces destroyed approximately two thirds of the town's estimated 60 structures. Reports of the \"Expedition against Bluffton\" were made by DuPont and Bacon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"8th. Private Calvin Havens, Co. \"F,\" 48th N.Y.

        "content": "The Lawcode [Datastanagirk'] of Mkhitar Gosh: a collection of medieval Armenian feudal laws compiled byMkhitar Gosh in the late 12th century. Its correct title is \"Book of Judgement.\"\nIn addition, Mkhitar's works included works from other authors; for example, the translations of Syriac-Roman laws in the Lawcode were not authored by Mkhitar Gosh.\nDuring the 13th century, in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, the Lawcode gained the force of law. In the 16th century, it was adopted by the Polish King Sigismund I for Armenian colonies in Lviv, Kamenets-Podolski, and other cities. Certain parts of the Lawcode were translated into Latin, Polish, and Tatar languages. In the 18th century, Mkhitar Gosh's Lawcode became part of Georgian legislation, known as Vakhtang's Code (a code of laws compiled by the King of Georgia, Vakhtang), and the code continued to be effective even after Georgia became part of Russia.\nThe Lawcode has been preserved in numerous Armenian manuscript sources, currently housed in the Matenadaran of Yerevan, Venice, Vienna, Beirut, Paris, and other renowned libraries and repositories.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe earliest copy of the Lawcode was probably rewritten during Gosh's lifetime. Perhaps two original versions have survived. Numerous manuscripts have been preserved (around 40 at the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). It was written with the aim of mitigating class contradictions and fostering the national-liberation spirit of the people. Editions A, B, and C of The Lawcode are known. Edition A consists of a preface and the book of judgments itself (251 articles). Edition B is divided into secular (130 articles) and ecclesiastical parts (124 articles). Edition C is identical to edition A but is concise and differs in essence.\n\n\n== 12 reasons for writing the Lawcode ==\nIn the introduction Mkhitar Gosh primarily discusses the significance and necessity of The Lawcode. Through his Book of Law, Mkhitar Gosh laid the foundation for the establishment and structure of the judiciary. In his discourse, Gosh referred to the existing legislative issues in Armenia. In Chapter B Mkhitar Gosh presents twelve reasons for the necessity of The Lawcode. \"These twelve chapters contained the reasons for writing this book of judgments.\"\n\n\n=== Social reason ===\nMkhitar Gosh considered the first reason to be that Muslims and other Christians believed that Armenians had no written laws. Mkhitar Gosh writes on this matter:\n\"Because although it was said that there was no need for the God to judge us by written letter, yet now we have resolved to do so, because many times we have heard insults not only from unbelievers but also from Christians, who say that according to the Gospel there is no judgment at all, due to the ignorance that resides within them. And because of their opinion, the disease of evil manifests twice: first, in that the legislator allegedly acted meaninglessly, and second, in that he did not want to live on par with human nations.\"\nThe second reason mentioned by Mkhitar is evil. \"Secondly, by its very nature, it led evil within us according to the laws, and it gave perfection to the imperfection of the soul and gave sorrow of love instead of hatred.\" Mkhitar Gosh considers evil to be the foundation of many crimes. Additionally, as an educator, he always advocates for love rather than hatred in his works.\nThe third reason he considers is laziness, when people do not get used to laws and the requirements of society and do not realize their importance for themselves. \"Thirdly, because due to lawlessness there are those who have become accustomed to the absence of laws and prophets and the Gospel, staying away from their authority, living in lawlessness, could not choose the book of judgment, which would awaken them from sleep, as if by the hand of the scripture of judgments, living meanwhile a worthy life.\"\n\nThe fourth reason was the lack of education, which over time became a significant problem leading to the absence of skills and experience, and Gosh points out that the requirements and circumstances have changed, and it is no longer possible to rely on prophetic and gospel laws. \"Fourthly, because skills and experience diminished over time and among nations, and worlds changed due to contingencies and did not abide by the laws, prophets, and the Gospel.\"\nThe fifth reason was that the Holy Spirit ceased to influence people's lives. Gosh notes that the absence of the influence of the Holy Spirit leads people to establish written laws and violate them. \"Fifthly, in the past, the Holy Spirit influenced people and contributed to the fulfillment of true judgment. The Spirit was a law written in the hearts of people, so there was no need for a written law. Now, when the Holy Spirit does not have such influence and people have 'run away' from Christian brotherhood, orthodoxy, and 'for this reason, you have been compelled to write' Lawcode.\"\nThe sixth reason, according to Gosh, is that human morality has declined, and swearing has become the primary means of impurity. \"Sixthly, because the reality of judgment leads to swearing, which the God did not allow, but which believers now often abuse in every case and wild judgments, with or without condemnation. Based on these realities, we have decided not to disregard the God's command but to establish laws and rules of judgment to address issues and, if necessary, to forgive during the trial.\"\nThe seventh reason, according to Gosh, is that Christians, lacking written provisions on crimes and judgments, resort to Muslim courts where bribery is entrenched. \"Seventhly, since there is no written judgment, Christians go and resort to unbelievers, following the reproach of the prophet, 'Is there no God in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'. On this account, the apostle reproaches, saying, 'And brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers'.\"\n\n\n=== Christian reasons ===\nThe eighth reason is that Christian courts are also full of corrupt bishops, priests, and laypeople who, due to ignorance, are unable to deliver just judgments. \"Eighthly, and now we see that there are many bishops, teachers, priests, and prominent laypeople who, for the sake of bribes and ignorance, pervert true judgments. And for all these reasons, we have agreed to write a book of judgments.\"\nThe ninth reason: \"Ninthly, because, based on human nature, no matter how many souls or people of different occupations or dreams we wish to pass a direct judgment on, we will not be able to do so due to forgetfulness, and even if we did, we would later return with regret and say: did we pass a fair judgment or not?\"\nThe tenth reason: \"Tenthly, because when the God created Adam, with each passing day the grace of the Holy Spirit strengthened upon us. And the devil said that the Holy Spirit did not remain with people because of their sins when they sinned in the paradise of God.\"\nThe eleventh reason: \"Eleventhly, because judges always fear God; they know that they will stand before the heavenly judge, so let them administer justice to people in true and direct manner.\"\nThe twelfth reason: \"Twelfthly, and people appearing before the judge fear God and do not bribe judges or allow them to evade true judgment, because the All-Knowing God sees their deeds, and we will all stand before Him in judgment.\"\n\n\n== Gosh' concept of state sovereignty in Lawcode ==\nIn his collection of laws, Gosh devotes much space to state sovereignty and the concept of state formation expressed in his laws. Through these laws, Gosh sought to encourage Armenian lords and the people to restore state independence. He considered the king the head of the state, who should have all the levers of sole governance. The second law, by right, is one of the most interesting, as Gosh talks about taxing other countries and subjugating other peoples and about not being enslaved, and this at a time when the orphaned Armenian people were under the influence of foreign states. One of the important characteristics of sovereignty, according to Gosh, is the supremacy of the state over subject peoples and complete independence in foreign relations. The state must have full control over internal affairs.\nHaving a profound understanding of Armenian history, Gosh regarded the unification of internal forces around a common idea as the most important circumstance for the restoration of Armenian independence. That's why Gosh was always angered by the villains who oppressed the peasants living in their domains. Gosh believed that the only way to restore national independence was through a national liberation struggle. Speaking about the king's powers, Gosh notes that the king must have absolute authority both domestically and in the conduct of foreign relations. Gosh asserts that the king should have the right only to build fortresses and castles; the ruler can only declare war or make peace.\nOne of the guarantees of a strong monarchy is the regulation of the inheritance system. Gosh notes that the state needs a system for choosing an heir to the throne, which will allow it to have an integrated state system. According to him, the question of appointing the firstborn as the heir to the throne arises from the history of the Armenian people.\nThus, Gosh presents a system that later allows many kingdoms to maintain their sovereignty and rely on the civilian population, enabling them to retain control of the country for as long as possible. However, as Gosh points out, everything is ephemeral, even kingdoms and kings.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\nCurrently, human beings are recognized as the highest value, and one of the most significant achievements of the present era is the definition and ranking of human rights.\n\nThe protection and definition of human rights have become key elements of the ideology of modern states. The fundamental ideology of contemporary social structures, democracy, is based on the ideology of human rights and human dignity.\nThe issue of human rights has always been at the forefront of the attention of philosophers and political scientists. Gosh based the protection of human rights on the individual who inherently required safeguarding of their rights. By advancing the conventional principles of his time, Gosh sought to shed light on the national liberation struggle. This was a crucial step in disseminating the Judicial Book among the lower classes of society. From this perspective, it was Gosh who emphasized the official format of the \"Judicial Book.\" Gosh understood well that without a clear state ideology and system, it is difficult to preserve the state as a high value for individuals and society. Gosh entrusted the protection of individual rights to the state with the aim of preserving the image of Armenians as a unified heritage.\nBefore Gosh, there were many descriptions of natural law, but he elevated it to a higher level by formulating natural law as a truth originally obtained from God, which needed to be preserved and passed down from generation to generation. In his opinion, it is up to humans to act justly and virtuously, and by their nature, people are free and equal. Natural law embodies the rights of divine justice, freedom, and equality, which are eternal, universal values that remain unchanged.\nThe written laws by which people must govern are based on natural law, establishing justice, maintaining peace, and preserving rights. This is why natural law and positive law within a state cannot be opposed. Positive law is a logical extension of natural law in society. It must align with divine law, the idea of equality, freedom, and justice. In this regard, Gosh made significant ideological progress, as previously the law protected not the individual, but a certain personality linked to their social status. Gosh transferred the idea of equality among people into the legislative field, defining a set of norms that truly equated people and individuals in positive law. However, this doesn't mean that Gosh goes against authoritarian ideology or eliminates conflicts between people and individuals in law, but his ideas stand out for their progressiveness and humanity.\nGosh's humanitarian views are primarily evident in his passages about the right to life. His negative attitude towards the capital punishment already demonstrates his humanity. Importantly, he envisions the correction of errors made by individuals. By proposing that criminals should repay their debt to society, he advocates for using criminals to obtain societal benefits. However, even here, Gosh's image as a pro-state actor is reflected. He believes that traitors who surrender fortresses or open city gates to the enemy deserve death without mercy. Gosh's humanitarian perspective lies in his efforts to achieve the removal of certain bodyparts instead of executions, which would give them the opportunity to repent. This form of punishment was particularly accepted among Muslims. At a time when Christians ruthlessly executed each other, and Muslims conducted amputations, which many people regretted, they nevertheless contributed in one way or another to the progress of society.\nAccording to Gosh, intentional murder can serve as grounds for the Capital punishment. From this perspective, one can mention medieval theological views in the works of Mkhitar, one of the important features of which is the capital punishment prescribed for intentional murder. Non-believers (non-Christians) who commit intentional murder should be executed without distinction, while Christians should be investigated and given the opportunity to repent. Speaking of repentance, he cites the New Testament and asserts that everyone has the right to repentance.\n\n\n== As a law ==\nThe sources of the Lawcode include the Mosaic Laws (Ten Commandments), Armenian canonical law, and Armenian customary law. It encompasses all branches and institutions of feudal law, as well as various spheres of social relations. As a typical feudal code, it reinforces dominant orders and class privileges, protecting ecclesiastical rights. According to the \"Datastanagirk,\" the judicial system comprised state courts (royal, princely, lower), feudal courts (manorial, class-based), corporate courts (communal, cooperative, fraternal), church courts (catholic, episcopal, catechetical), and extraordinary courts. The judicial process was accusatorial-adversarial, with minimal formality. Proceedings commenced upon the complaint of a private accuser (plaintiff), while authorities initiated trials in rare cases. Judicial evidence included confession, witness testimony, oath (in certain cases), written documents, and expert opinions. Any action against existing social relations, the state, governance, property, life and health, the church, or dominant ideology was considered a crime. The causes of criminality, both in Armenia and elsewhere, were primarily socio-economic, although Lawcode also attributed factors such as human rationality and weakened religious fervor, leading to moral decay. Prior to the Middle Ages, insects, animals, and even inanimate objects were considered criminals. Based on the principle of subjective culpability, Lawcode deems sin worthy of condemnation not for the act itself but for the act committed. According to the Datastanagirk, insanity also constitutes a circumstance excluding judicial liability.\n\n\n=== Marital relationship ===\nThe establishment of marital relations between a woman and a man was an important guarantee from the perspective of legal development. According to Gosh, the marital age for a wife was 15 years. If a marriage was contracted against her will, it was considered that the woman was forced into marriage, and such a marriage was deemed involuntary, thus the woman could be divorced. This approach was of fundamental significance because marriage was a voluntary union, and a woman could not be coerced.\nIn marital relations, Gosh adhered to the principle of monogamy, considering bigamy and polygamy punishable. However, both men and women were allowed to enter into marriage a second time, and in exceptional cases, even a third time.\nThe Lawcode prohibited violence against women. A husband had no right to inflict bodily harm on his wife; otherwise, he should be punished with a double fine prescribed for such actions. If the husband repeated his actions after the fine and endangered the wife's health, she had the right to divorce.\nMkhitar Gosh raised a unique issue that we will not find in other medieval sources, namely the establishment of property equality between men and women.\nA woman had the right to independently dispose of her property. She could bequeath her property at her discretion. Her children inherited her property regardless of their inheritance from their father. Such an approach to women was a progressive step for that period.\n\n\n=== The problem of heredity ===\nSpeaking about the inheritance rights of children, the author pays special attention to disabled children. He distinguishes between two types of disability: intellectual and physical. The former are deprived of intellect and are unable to manage inheritance, thus cannot be heirs. Gosh believed that after the father's death, the main title of the household traditionally passes to the eldest son, and if, due to his death or for other reasons, he is unable to fulfill his duties, it should pass by inheritance to the second son or the next heir. Mkhitar believed that the inheritance title should not be left vacant, as it could have serious consequences for the state or government.\nGosh advocated for regulating many laws by customary force if they could be implemented, and in case of impossibility, he proposed using the experience of other countries. According to Gosh, those laws that have a direct relation to the state structure and issues of utmost importance for the state should be regulated by customary force.\n\n\n== Punishments ==\nIn the Lawcode, sin is perceived in two senses: religious and legal: the former as a violation of God's law, the latter as the legality established by humans. Acknowledging that sin in the legal sense is simultaneously sin in the religious sense (although not always), Mkhitar Gosh accordingly envisages two types of punishment: spiritual-church and physical. The former implied only ecclesiastical courts, while the latter secular courts. Mkhitar Gosh accepted the following punishments: spiritual-church (exile, anathema, various forms of repentance, demotion, dismissal), physical-material: capital punishment, corporal punishments (beating, amputation), deprivation or restriction of freedom, property-fines. Establishing that the effectiveness of punishment is not determined by severity, Mkhitar Gosh adopts the progressive principle for his time of the correlation between the crime and the punishment, \"and the punishment must be commensurate with the damage\".\nIt is one of the most significant legal monuments of Armenian political and legal thought and of the Middle Ages in general, containing many advanced provisions for its time, which are still relevant today. For example, Mkhitar Gosh believes that the purpose of punishment should not be torture and revenge, but discipline, correction and education.\n\n\n== Personal and property relations ==\n\nIn the \"Lawcode,\" there are also remarkable provisions regarding the regulation of personal and property relations between spouses. The man is the head of the household, and all family members, including the wife, are subordinate to him. However, male rule is not tyrannical or arbitrary. The rights of both men and women are combined with certain obligations towards the husband and other family members. The husband undertakes to respect his wife, to be humane towards her, to care for her needs, to provide for her material well-being, to care for her when she is ill, to demand marital fidelity, and so on. The husband is subject to legal liability for beating his wife. Mkhitar Gosh conditions the relative equality of women's rights on property relations.\nProperty owned by spouses prior to marriage is separate, while property acquired during marriage is considered joint ownership. From the moment of marriage, a woman had material and property support, which served as a guarantee of her rights in relation to her husband and within the family. The \"Lawcode\" is extremely important in terms of conveying information about the inner life of the Armenian people.\nOne of the most important provisions of the Lawcode is the right to natural equality of people, based on the Bible. Mkhitar Gosh explains the fact of inequality among people by socio-economic relations. Contrary to the ideology of his era, Gosh justifies social inequality with economic reasons.\nGosh notes that the villagers fell into poverty because they lost their main source of income — the land. In order to regulate land relations, he limits the power of usurpers. Explaining the cause of inequality and raising the question of the need to address it was a novelty for the entire legal system of the Middle Ages. Centuries after Gosh, only in the Renaissance era, renowned scholars began to talk about the necessity of equality among people.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nIn this sense, Mkhitar Gosh is one of the representatives of medieval humanism. \"The Lawcode\" rejects religious intolerance, protects the dignity of Muslims, and does not provide for punishments based on religious affiliation. \"The Lawcode\" was used even beyond Armenia, in those colonies where the Armenian community was granted the right to internal autonomy. Even today, in Sudan, the state court uses \"The Lawcode\" when considering civil cases of members of the Armenian community.\n\n\n=== Enforcement of the Loawcode ===\nThe prevailing opinion in Armenian studies regarding the use of Mkhitar Gosh's Datastanagirk in medieval Armenia is negative. At its core lies a fact that seems quite weighty from the outside. The Lawcode originated not from an authorized body but was the result of an individual's initiative, leading to the assumption that it had obligatory force emanating from such a source. Concurrently, Gosh's Datastanagirk found its application in the legal life of various countries.\nDuring the time of Mkhitar Gosh, numerous similar legislative acts were known to have been introduced. In the second half of the 12th century, a collection of laws based on Roman laws became enforceable in southern France. In 1250, the Accursius Digest, compiled by the last representative of the school of Glossators, was introduced into courts. Many similar works emerged in medieval Europe.\nNumerous records from the second half of the 12th century attest to the acute need for a code of laws in medieval Armenia. Both the clergy and the authorities felt this necessity. In the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia  in the West, Nerses Lambronatsi initiated a collection of laws, while here in the East, Mkhitar Gosh initiated this work. However, what Nerses Lambronatsi created mainly included church and, to some extent, household rules, whereas Mkhitar Gosh's Datastanagirk represents one of the monuments of legal thought of that time. It is worth noting that both in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and in the Bagratid Kingdom, justice and state power were exercised by customary authority, but after Mkhitar Gosh, Armenian authorities could use the Lawcode created by him. The Datastanagirk was introduced during the reign of the Zakarians.\nIn 1254, Sempad the Constable presented Mkhitar Gosh's Lawcode with some modifications, which was adopted in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Mkhitar Gosh's Datastanagirk was used under different names in other countries as well as in Armenian colonies of Diaspora.\n\n\n== Translations and publications ==\nThe \"Lawcode\" was first published in Armenian by Vahan Bastamyants in 1880. It has several editions in other languages. It was first translated into Latin (abbreviated, modified depending on the place and conditions), which the Armenian colony of Poland presented to Sigismund I for approval in 1519 to regulate according to their national laws. The Latin edition was published by Bishof (1862). From 1519 to 1523, the Latin edition was translated into Polish (published by K. Wucicki in 1843, A. Baronch in 1869, and in the third volume of the Krakow Polish Legal Collection, 1906), which was also translated into Gheg Albanian (in Armenian letters) simultaneously. The \"Lawcode\" itself was also partially translated into Gheg Albanian. The Book of Judgments was translated into Georgian, forming a section of the \"Armenian Law\" of the Vakhtang laws, the Georgian edition of which was published by L. Melikset-Beg in 1928 and by I. Rodilsa in 1963. The Russian translation was first published in 1828.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMkhitar Gosh\nGoshavank\n\n\n== Sources ==\nArmenian\n\nՄխիթար Գոշ, Գիրք Դատաստանի (գրաբար) Archived 2020-07-23 at the Wayback Machine\nՄխիթար Գոշ, Գիրք Դատաստանի (աշխատասիր․ Խ․ Թորոսյանի), Երևան, 1975։\nԽաչիկ Սամուելյան, Մխիթար Գոշի Դատաստանագիրքը և հին հայոց քաղաքացիական իրավունքը, Վիեննա, 1911\nԱլեքսեյ Սուքիասյան, «Մխիթար Գոշը և Հայոց դատաստանագիրքը», Երևան, 1965\nԽոսրով Թորոսյան, Դատարանային համակարգը միջնադարյան Հայաստանում ըստ Մխիթար Գոշի Դատաստանագրքի / ԳԱ «Տեղեկագիր», No.125 1965\nԽոսրով Թորոսյան, «Մխիթար Գոշի Դատաստանագրքի գործադրության մասին միջնադարյան Հայաստանում», / «Պատմաբանասիրական հանդես», No.3, 1971\nՎահան Բաստամյանց, «Մխիթար Գոշի Դատաստանագիր. - Հառաջաբանություն հրատարակողի», Վաղարշապատ, 1880\nRussian\n\nСемейное право по Мхитару Гошу, «Юридическое обозрение», Тифлис, 1885\nХосров Торосян, «Судоустройство и судопроизводство в средневековой Армении по Судебнику Мхитара Гоша».

        "revision_id": 1221389939,
        "earliest_creation_date": "2008-12-18 22:24:24",
        "content": "The Wespe-class gunboats were a class of 11 armored gunboats of the Imperial German Navy. They were meant for the defence of the North Sea coast. AG Weser in Bremen built them between 1874 and 1881. The boats were often in reserve or used for training purposes.\n\n\n== Context ==\n\n\n=== Technical developments ===\nIn Germany, the first plans for coastal defense centered on the use of monitors, e.g. SMS Arminius of about 1,800 t. When the torpedo was developed, the use of such big warships seemed unnecessary. Smaller vessels to defend the torpedo barriers seemed enough.\n\n\n=== Local circumstances ===\nThe German Baltic Sea coast did not require gunboats. Here, all but two of the harbors had parallel moles. These stretched into the sea on both sides of the fairway. With torpedo barriers and heavy coastal batteries to protect these, it was thought unnecessary to have gunboats to keep the enemy at bay. (Later on, the actual stations of the Wespe class seemed to contradict these ideas.)\nOn the German North Sea coast and the east coast of Schleswig-Holstein the situation was quite different. Here the Eider, Elbe, Weser, Jade, and Ems exited into shallow waters with many shoals and islands. If the enemy could pass the outer limits of these shallow waters, he could safely anchor and prepare an attack or landing. Vessels defending these areas therefore needed a shallow draught. They also had to defend the local torpedo barriers. Here, these had to be so far from the coast that they could not to be defended by coastal artillery.\n\n\n=== Armored or unarmored ===\n\nAfter concluding that on the North Sea coast, monitors of about 2,000 t could be replaced by much smaller vessels, the next question was whether these small vessels should be armored or not. England, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Russia opted for unarmored gunboats. Germany opted for bigger, armored gunboats.\nThe 'unarmored' school of thought proposed small unarmored gunboats with a single heavy gun. It noted that in these circumstances, these boats offered a small target, while their guns could penetrate up to 20 cm (7.9 in) of armor at medium distances. Due to their very shallow draught, these small gunboats could also evade ram attacks. A further advantage was the limited cost of these boats. Which of course also meant that one could buy more of these. This led to the Ant-class gunboats of about 250 t and the Ever-class gunboats of 200 t.\nThe German Navy school of thought said that an unarmored vessel could only be useful when it was covered by natural heights or a mole. In all other circumstances, it risked swift destruction. The threat by enemy capital ships was of course obvious. A less obvious threat was that posed by steam launches (Dampfbeibooten). These of course had much smaller guns, but these light guns were sufficient to destroy unarmored ships. These light guns were also much more in line with the size of the vessel on which they were mounted. This caused that the launches were way more stable at sea, relating in a far higher chance to hit the target.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nAfter the German Navy opted for armored gunboats, it could issue some specifications for new gunboats. The navy required the use of a gun that could penetrate 20 cm of armor, even at long distances. In turn, the boats should themselves also be protected 20 cm of armor. The gunboats should furthermore be seaworthy and have a shallow draught. The navy required only a limited speed for the vessels.\nThe Wespe-class gunboats were built by AG Weser in Bremen. Wespe, Viper, and Biene were launched in 1876. Mücke and Skorpion were launched in 1877. Basilisk and Chamäleon were launched in 1878. Krokodil was launched in 1879 and Salamander in 1880.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Hull and armor ===\n\nThe Wespe-class gunboats' hulls were made of iron. They were 43.50 metres (142 ft 9 in) long with a beam of 10.65 m (34 ft 11 in), a depth of hold of 4.10 m (13 ft 5 in), and a draught of 3.10 m (10 ft 2 in). They displaced 1,109 t. They had no rigging, only a signals mast.\nThe armor belt was 203 mm (8 in) thick. It continued at that same thickness along the whole bow section, but tapered to 102 mm (4 in) at the stern. This was because the Wespes were planned to engage the enemy with their bow forward, instead of with the broadside. The deck of the Wespes was protected by a 50 mm (2 in) thick deck armor. The class also had watertight compartments and a double hull on the bottom side.\nOn top of the armored deck, there was a light iron superstructure that served to make the boats more seaworthy. The section before the gun emplacement served as accommodation for the crew. The aft section served as quarters for the officers and non-commissioned officers. Behind the gun, there was a deckhouse, which gave a dry access to the machinery and the officer's quarters.\n\n\n=== Armament ===\nThe Wespes were armed with a 30.5 cm MRK L/22 on pivot carriage which put its trunnions 3.7 m above the water. The gun was placed behind a circular armored barbette of 203 mm (8 in) thickness. The class also had a ram.\nLater, the Wespes got two 8.8 cm SK guns and two revolver guns. Below the waterline they got two torpedo tubes.\nAt the time, the Wespe class combined the heaviest gun in the German navy with an armor protection that was comparable to that of many battleships. It was thought this would allow the boats to engage most enemy capital ships on distances at which most of the enemy's guns could not penetrate the boat's armor. In the coastal area, the shallow draught boats could then evade again in spite of their low speed.\n\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe Wespes had two separate steam engines which each drove their own propeller and were separated from each other by a watertight bulkhead. Together, they produced 700 indicated horsepower (520 kW) and gave the vessel a speed of 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph). For war, there was enough coal on board for steaming at full speed for 40 hours. More coal could be loaded for expeditions that did not require shallow draught.\n\n\n=== Cost ===\nThe total cost of a Wespe, including machinery and artillery ranged from about 1,034,018 to 1,210,316 Mark.\n\n\n== Use ==\nIn 1881, the North Sea station had: Viper, Mücke, Skorpion, Salamander, Natter, and Wespe. The Baltic Sea station had: Basilisk, Kamäleon, Krokodil, Hummel, and Biene.\n\n\n== Boats of the class ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBarnes, F.K.

ToadetteEdit! 11:52, 26 April 2024 (UTC)\n\n\"Shield '94\" was an operation carried out on late 1994 south of Bihac, with the goal of capturing the towns on the way and threatening the city.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn October 25, an operation named \"Thunder '94\" led by Atif Dudaković was carried out with the goal of pushing the 2nd Krajina Corps back from the same region. The operatuon was a success, and by October 31 Bosnian militants successfully re-claimed 250km² of territory, including the town of Kulen Vakuf. However, some Bosnian goals weren't reached: in fact, Bosanska Krupa resisted to the attacks and it was defended just by the 11th Krupa Light Infantry Brigade. To re-capture the lost territories, the VRS then launched Shield '94.\n\n\n== Course of Shield '94 ==\nThe Operation was commanded by general Manojlo Milanovic and was a success. Between November 4 and November 20, the Bosnians were pushed back to the initial positions, and Bihac was semi-encircled.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Military operations of the Bosnian War",

        "content": "Tamar (or Tumuna) Museridze (born ) is a Georgian journalist who discovered that a large number of Georgian babies were stolen from new mothers. She founded an organisation where thousands are trying to see these children reunited. She has been honoured by her country and the BBC for founding the Vedzeb organisation.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMuseridze was born in about 1986. She went to work for the Georgian television company when she was eighteen. She was surprised at the age of 31 when she discovered that her parents were not her biological mother and father as she was adopted. She had discovered this when she found errors on her own birth certificate as she sorted through her (de facto) mother's belongings after her death.\nMuseridze had founded the organisation \"Looking For\" (Vedzeb) after finding out that a large number of babies were stolen from new mothers. The nurses and doctors told the parents that the baby had died, but actually the baby was sold to other parents for them to adopt. The babies were sold for an amount equal to an average yearly wage. Her organisation is credited with reuniting hundreds of families but as of 2023 she had not found her own biological family, An example was Irma Dvalishvili who in 1990 gave birth to twins who were said to be fine, but the next day she was told that one of them had died. It was only after they insisted that a body was returned to the parents but they assumed that this was the dead twin. The surviving twin, Mariam Kobelashvili, became suspicious when she found that the birth and the death of her twin had never been recorded. The hospital said that it had destroyed all the old records. In 2022, she was  posting pictures of herself on social media, at different ages, in the hope of finding her lost sister.\nAnother case that came to light involved identical twins, Amy and Amo. One of them had seen her twin on Georgia's Got Talent when she was twelve but her parents had told her that \"everyone has a doppelganger\". Her de facto parents did not know that she had a twin and they hadn't told her that she was adopted or the amount money that they had paid for her.\nIt is estimated that there may be thousands of missing babies as this scheme was running across multiple hospitals and in time the babies were also being sent abroad. One boy claimed that he had found his biological parents who said that their child had died. However DNA results confirmed that her was correct and he was the son they had been told was dead. Some parents were told that their children were buried in the hospital cemetery, but investigations reveal that no hospital in Georgia had a separate cemetery.\nIn 2023 Museridze was included in the BBC's annual list of 100 inspirational women and she was incredulous that the BBC had shown interest in a story in Georgia.\nOn International Women's Day in 2024 the President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, gave Medals of Honour to Museridze and four other women. The four others were Babutsa Pataraia, Ana Arganashvili, Eliso Amirejibi and Nato Shavlakadze. They were all associated with human rights and the President gave them the award at the Orbeliani Palace. She was thanked for her inititative, courage and responsibility in founding the \"Vedzeb\" organisation.\n\n\n== References ==",

The museum, located in the Nuevos Ministerios complex in Madrid, is attached to the Ministry of Housing.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was established on 29 December 2006 as Museo Nacional de Arquitectura y Urbanismo. The original idea was designed to have two seats: one in Salamanca dedicated to architecture, and another in Barcelona dedicated to urban planning; in addition to a Documentation Center.\nOn 14 June 2022, the Cortes Generales approved the Law on Quality of Architecture, the seventh article of which included the constitution of the \"Casa de la Arquitectura\", a new name for the museum with the aim of relaunching the project after almost a decade without progress.\n\nOn 18 December 2023, in an event chaired by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, The House of Architecture was inaugurated as a new National Museum in the arcade of Nuevos Ministerios in Madrid. The following day, the Council of Ministers approved the museum's statutes, confirming its headquarters as permanent with the possibility of secondary sites in other Spanish cities.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe House of Architecture is attached to the Ministry of Housing and is governed by a Board of Trustees, chaired by the director of the museum and made up of representatives of the Ministries of Housing and Culture, as well as representatives of the official associations of architects.\n\n\n== The museum ==\nThe House of Architecture is located in Paseo de la Castellana, in the arcade of Nuevos Ministerios. It is dedicated to promoting, improving knowledge, valuing, and disseminating architecture, urban planning, and landscaping, with special attention to Spanish works and architects. The museum, in addition to the physical space for its permanent collection and the temporary exhibitions, maintains an online virtual museum on its website.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Matt Rowean (born August 6, 1982, in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American artist, creative director, and entrepreneur. He is a Partner and Chief Creative Officer at MATTE Projects.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMatt Rowean graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in Painting and Communication Design. He also participated in the RISD Pre-college program. After completing his studies in 2004, Rowean relocated to New York City.\nIn 2008, he left Strategic Group and co-founded RJW (later rebranded as JWALK) alongside Doug Jacob and Charli Walk. The company worked with brands such as Lacoste, David Yurman, Equinox, and ABC. He oversaw the brand identity development of the seafood restaurant Catch, which expanded from a flagship in New York City to an international company with locations in L.A., Dubai, and Playa del Carmen.\nRowean shifted focus to fine art and other non-advertising pursuits after leaving RJW in 2011 due to a two-year non-compete. During this time, he worked on the branding of the Full Moon Festival, which led to joining Brett Kincaid and Max Pollack at MATTE Projects, helping to evolve it from a concert production entity to a holding company composed of several developed businesses based in New York. MATTE Projects is a full-service 360 creative services agency operating in entertainment (music & events), feature film production, and has its own venue \"HERO\".\nIn 2019, Rowean was among Emmy Nominees for Fyre: The Greatest Party that Never Happened.\nDuring his tenure as Chief Creative Officer, MATTE won several Clio awards for their campaign work with Cartier.\n\n\n== MATTE Projects ==\nFounded in 2011 by Brett Kincaid, Max Pollack. Matthew Rowean joined a year later and helped evolve MATTE Projects into a creative agency and production company known for organizing high-profile events like New York City's Full Moon Music Festival and Rihanna's Met Gala after-party. The company operates in cities like New York and Mexico City, and has worked with clients such as Tom Ford, Google, and Dom Pérignon. Besides events, MATTE Projects offers content creation, digital solutions, and experiential design, working with brands such as KITH, Adidas, Amazon, Cartier, and YSL and talent such as Kanye West, James Blake and Jay-Z.\nMATTE Projects also operates in the fashion industry, specializing in fashion events, live fashion show capture, campaigns, and directing fashion films for brands such as Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Alexander Wang, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Puma and other brands.\nIn 2012, MATTE launched Full Moon, a boutique music festival at the South Street Seaport. Full Moon later moved to Governors Island and became a 10,000-person festival.\nThe company's collaborations include The Macallan, KITH, Cartier, Audemars Piguet, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, Prada, Marriott, Apple, Airbnb, and more. Their work for Cartier was recognized by Clio Awards.\nIn 2024 MATTE partnered with PUMA to create their Forever Faster campaign, and is PUMA's biggest marketing investment yet – it's the brand's first worldwide brand campaign in 10 years with the objective to strengthen their positioning as the Fastest Sports Brand in the world.\nThe company produced Can't Stop Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story. The film won the Hollywood Documentary Award at the 2017 Hollywood Film Awards. In 2019, company co-produced the Emmy-nominated Netflix documentary FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened and initiated \"La Luna,\" an eco-friendly summer party. Through the pandemic, they created the documentary \"Hell Of A Cruise\", available Peacock, featuring the early spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships. The film focuses on the Diamond Princess cruise, which in January 2020 unknowingly became a hotspot for the virus, transforming a luxury voyage into a crisis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMatt Rowean’s website\nMatt Rowean on IMDb",

        "content": "\"Voy Pa'lla\" (short for Voy Para Allá; English:\"I'm Going Over There\") is the debut single by Dominican musician, Anthony Santos. It served as the lead single for his debut album, La Chupadera (1991). The song became a huge success as it help Santos reach mainstream fame. It is one of his signature songs and it is considered one of the greatest bachata songs in history.\n\n\n== Covers ==\nFrank Reyes released a cover of the song in the same year as the original. This cover was released for Reyes' debut album, Tu Serás Mi Reina. This would cause confusion decades later as a lot of people started to wonder who the song actually belong to. An article by the Diario Oriental (Oriental Journal) mentions that it was possibly that Reyes was the one who had recorded the song first and then Santos made a cover of that same song. Yet, it is unclear whose version is the original as Reyes's version is not as known as Santos's version. But despite the confusion, it is confirmed that Santos is the original performer of the song. This has been confirmed by other bachata artist, historians, and even Santos himself. In a 1996 documentary about his life and career, Santos explained how he wrote the song and what it did for his career.\nTony Berroa,a Dominican bachata singer, released a cover for his 1992 studio album El Solterito Del Este Y Los Reyes Del Este. \nLas Chicas del Can, a merengue band, released a cover in 1992 for their tenth studio album, Explosivo.\n\n\n== Remixes ==\nIn 2019, he released a Merengue remix with Dominican rapper, Vakero. They released it with the title \"Voy Pa Allá\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Donna Nook Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located north of the village of North Somercotes, in the East Lindsey district of the county of Lincolnshire. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association (LCSA) in 1829, and subsequently transferred to the RNLI in 1864.\nThe station was closed in 1931.\n\n\n== History ==\nA lifeboat station was opened at Donna Nook by the LCSA in 1829. They acquired a second-hand lifeboat from fishermen at Saltfleet, a boat built in 1805 for Bridlington Lifeboat Station by Henry Greathead. However, it was soon realised that the boat was not suitable for the location. The Theddlethorpe lifeboat was placed at Donna Nook in 1830, until a new boat, a 28-foot lifeboat constructed by Bell & Grange of Grimsby, arrived on station in 1832. This new boat would launch 9 times in the following 32 years, and save 25 lives.\nThe LCSA transferred all their lifeboats and stations over to the RNLI in 1864. A new boathouse was constructed to house a new lifeboat, a 30-foot self-righting boat built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London. The boat arrived on 28 October 1864, and was named North Briton.\nIn 1878, the Donna Nook lifeboat would be replaced by a larger 34-foot 10-oar self-righting boat., constructed by Woolfe and Sons. The cost of the boat, carriage and boathouse modifications were provided as a gift from Miss Dixon, of Holton Park, Lincolnshire, in memory of her brother. The boathouse was named Richard Roadley Dixon Lifeboat Establishment, Donna Nook. At a ceremony in the town of Louth on 13 December 1878, the boat was named Richard and presented to the Institution. She carried on her bow the inscription \"Lord Save Us Lest We Perish\".\nTwo more lifeboats would serve at Donna Nook, both named Richard, again provided from the generosity of Miss Dixon.\nIn 1922, Donna Nook was one of the first lifeboat stations to receive a tractor to assist with the launch of the lifeboat. This was T9, one of 19 manufactured by Clayton for the RNLI.\nWith increasing numbers of motor-powered lifeboats, including the Humber lifeboat at Spurn Point, able to travel further and faster than the traditional Pulling and Sailing lifeboats, the decision was made to close Donna Nook Lifeboat Station in 1931. In 102 years service, the lifeboat had been launched 92 times, with 164 lives saved.\nThe Richard (ON 522) would later serve at Whitby as the Jacob and Rachel Vallentine. No evidence remains of the Richard Roadley Dixon Lifeboat Establishment, Donna Nook boat house, which was located at a site, later to become Donna Nook RAF Station.\n\n\n== Notable rescues ==\nOn Christmas Eve, 1921, the Richard (ON 522) was launched to the aid of the fishing boat Koivisto. She had been adrift at sea for 9 days, following engine failure, finally coming ashore at Saltfleet haven.\nAfter struggling through rough seas, the lifeboat arrived at the vessel, and rescued the crew of 4. However, whilst standing by while a tug attempted to save the vessel, the lifeboat was capsized, throwing 11 crew and the 4 rescuees into the water. Fortunately, everyone was recovered to the lifeboat, and then to the tug, and with the fishing boat and lifeboat in tow, all were taken safely to Grimsby.\nFor this service, John Dobson, Acting Coxswain, and all the lifeboat crew, were awarded The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Donna Nook\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nThomas Dobson, Coxswain - 1869\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nJohn Thomas Dobson, Coxswain - 1925\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nWilliam Robinson, Honorary Secretary - 1870\nMr Houlden, Honorary Secretary - 1884\nJohn Dobson, Acting Coxswain - 1921\nEvery member of the Donna Nook Lifeboat - 1921\nGeorge Humberstone, Second Coxswain - 1925\nFred Wilson, Bowman - 1925\n\n\n== Donna Nook lifeboats ==\n\n\n=== Lincolnshire Coast Shipwreck Association lifeboats ===\n\n\n=== RNLI lifeboats ===\n\n\n=== Launch and recovery tractors ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Novaculina myanmarensis is a species of bivalve within the family Pharidae. The species was first described from Myanmar, in the Irrawaddy River near the Thin Baw Kone village, Pakokku District. More findings have exdended its range to the Salween River basin as well. Habitats include downstream and middle section of large freshwater rivers, with the species inhabiting gravel and clay substrates by making deep vertical holes for burrows. Measurments of the species are shell lengths of 20.5 to 46.5 mm, shell heights of 7.9 to 17.5 mm, and shell widths of 4.5 to 13.3 mm. It can be distinguished from closely related species (such as N. gangetica and N. chinensis) from its more rectangular shell shape and truncated posterior end. In the downstream section of the Salween River the species is utilized as food by local villagers, in contrast to the Irrawaddy River where it isn't unutilized.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nippon Banzai is a 1986 album by Congolese band Zaïko Langa Langa, released on their ProZal label. The album followed the group's groundbreaking tour of Japan in October 1986, marking a milestone as the second Congolese musical ensemble to perform there, after Papa Wemba, an early member of Zaïko Langa Langa, and his band Viva La Musica's tour in May of the same year.\nThis album is widely regarded as Zaïko Langa Langa's greatest artistic and commercial success, propelling them to wider international renown (zones including Europe and the West Indies) and impacting Congolese discography in general. The tracklist represents an average setlist from the band's Japanese tour.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 1986, Zaïko Langa Langa embarked on a tour of Japan, becoming only the second group from Zaire to do so (after Papa Wemba & Viva La Musica in May of the same year). Performing at prestigious venues in Tokyo, Osaka and Sapporo, the group received a warm welcome from the Japanese public. Additionally, Papa Wemba and Zaïko Langa Langa's tours in Japan inspired a group of Japanese musicians to form Yoka Choc, performing Congolese rumba.\n\n\n== Concept and recording ==\nThe concept for Nippon Banzai originated from Jossart N’Yoka Longo, the band leader of Zaïko Langa Langa. Inspired by their successful tour in Japan, N’Yoka proposed the idea of creating a medley album (cutting songs short to aim an international audience) that would feature the setlist of the tour, a blend of their classic hits from the late seventies, such as \"Sentiment Awa,\" \"Kin Kiesse,\" and \"Sangela,\" alongside newer material from the eighties like \"Muvaro,\" \"Liwa Yo Moyibi,\" and \"SVP Mbey.\" Initially met with skepticism from other band members, the concept eventually garnered acceptance, and recording for the album took place after the tour concluded in late 1986.\n\n\n== Cover ==\n\nThe album cover of \"Nippon Banzai\" is revered as one of the most iconic in African and Congolese music. Designed by Joss Bokken and Jacques Duquesne, the cover appears to draw inspiration from the Japanese flag. It features the band members, depicted from left to right: Jossart N’Yoka Longo, Bimi Ombale, Dindo Yogo, and Lengi Lenga.\n\n\n== Commercial performance and impact ==\nUpon its release, Nippon Banzai swiftly gained widespread acclaim and commercial success, transcending geographical boundaries to resonate with audiences across Africa, the West Indies, Europe, and notably, Japan. The album sold over 100,000 copies, firmly establishing Zaïko Langa Langa as an international musical force. While it narrowly missed certification as gold in France, the album faced challenges from pirated versions that proliferated in the market. It also played a pivotal role in popularizing Congolese rumba globally, with the genre often referred to as \"du Zaïko\" in some African regions.\nThe medley format highlighted in the album became a hallmark of Congolese music, inspiring subsequent releases such as Franco Luambo's \"Animation Non Stop\" (1987), Tabu Ley Rochereau's \"Soum Djoum/Afrisa de L’an 2000\" (1989), and Wenge Musica's \"Wenge Live\" (1989), among others. Prior to \"Nippon Banzai\", Zaïko Langa Langa had experimented with medleys, releasing albums like \"La Tout Neige, Christine, Nalali Mpongui\" (1983) and later \"Jetez l’éponge\" (1989).\n\n\n=== TF1 performance ===\nDespite rejections of previous albums due to mixing and mastering rules, Zaïko Langa Langa's submission of Nippon Banzai to TF1 in 1987 was finally accepted. The band appeared on Christophe Dechavanne's show Ciel, mon Mardi, where they performed \"Sentiment Awa\", \"Sandra Lina\" and \"Muvaro\", making it the first appearance of a Congolese group on TF1.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe songs \"Muvaro\" and \"Sandra Lina\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 1987 film \"La Vie est Belle\" starring Papa Wemba. \"Toyambana\" is also heard in a scene in the film.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== CD version (1988) ===\nNote: Last 4 tracks are taken from 1987 LP “Subissez les Conséquences”.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJossart N'Yoka Longo – vocals\nBimi Ombale – vocals\nLengi Lenga – vocals\nJP Buse – vocals\nDindo Yogo – vocals\nNono Monzuluku – animation, shaker\nBébé Atalaku – animation, shaker\nMbuta Matima – guitar, artistic direction\nEnoch Zamuangana – guitar\nPetit Poisson – guitar\nJimmy Yaba – guitar\nBeniko Popolipo – guitar\nOncle Bapius – bass guitar\nJosé Piano-Piano – synthesizer\nMeridjo Belobi – drums\nBakunde Ilo Pablo – drums\nDjerba Mandjeku – congas\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dalip Singh Majithia (27 July 1930 - 15 April 2024) was an Indian Air Force pilot. He primarily served during second world war. At the time of his death on 15 April 2024, he was the oldest living pilot of the Indian Air Force at the age of 103.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born on 27 July 1930 in Shimla. His father Kirpal Singh Majithia was an important person during the British ruled Punjab. His grandfather Sundar Singh Majithia was associated with Chief Khalsa Divan and was one of the founders of Khalsa College, Amritsar. Dalip Singh studied at Khalsa college and later at Lahore, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe learned the basics of flying at Karachi Flying Club on a Gypsy Moth aircraft. In 1940, he joined the IAF volunteer reserve in 1940 during the Second World War. On 1 August 1940, he joined the 4th Pilot's Course at the Initial Training School (ITA) in Walton, Lahore, where after three months, he won the best pilot trophy. To continue his advanced training, he was posted to the No.1 Flying Training School in Ambala.\nIn March 1943, he joined the Number 6 Squadron under the command of 'Baba' Mehr Singh in the rank of flying officer. In January 1944, he was posted in Kohat as the Flight Commander of Number 3 Squadron and flew Hurricane aircraft. Later, he was posted in Burma (Myanmar) as the Flight Commander of No. 4 Squadron. A long bout of illness kept him out of active flying for sometime. After that, he served at the Air Headquarters. Later he served as the IAF's Liaison Officer to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Melbourne, Australia.\nOn 18 March 1947, he retired from the Indian Air Force. After that, he flew as a private pilot. In 1949, he made history by being the first to land a plane in the Kathmandu valley. He conducted the landing of an aircraft in Kathmandu, Nepal on an unprepared piece of land. That site is now the site of the Nepal's international airport. Through his career, he had more than 1,100 flying hours to his name, including on aircrafts like Hurricanes and Spitfires. By his fellow pilots, he was affectionately called 'Maji'. He flew for the last time in January 1979.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter retirement from Air Force, he settled at his family's estate in Sardarnagar, near Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. He also ran a successful business venture. In March 2021, 100 year old Dalip Singh and his 99 year old wife Joan Sanders Majithia received first doses of COVID-19 vaccine at Sunrise Hospital in Gurugram, along with their 72-year-old daughter Kiran Sandhu and three other family friends in their 70s.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 18 February 1947 Dalip Singh married Joan Sanders at his family's estate in Gorakhpur, whom he had met during his service in Melbourne, Australia. She was in Women's Royal Australian Navy Service as code breaker during the war. The couple had two daughters, named Kiran and Mira.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frank J. M. Verstraete is a Belgian veterinary dentist and oral surgeon, academic scholar, and author. He is a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Davis.\nVerstraete is most known for his works on oral pathology, comparative odontology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and oral diagnostic imaging. Among his notable works are his publications in academic journals, including the American Journal of Veterinary Research, Frontiers in Veterinary Science and the Journal of Comparative Pathology, as well as authored and edited books such as Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Dogs and Cats and Self-Assessment Color Review of Veterinary Dentistry.\n\n\n== Education ==\nVerstraete earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from the University of Gent in 1980 and a Master of Medicine in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Pretoria in 1985.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVerstraete commenced his academic journey in 1981, joining the Department of Surgery at the University of Pretoria. During this period, he served as a lecturer from 1981 to 1984, progressing to the role of Senior lecturer from 1984 to 1987. Subsequently, from 1988 to 1994, he held the position of associate professor at the same institution. Following this, he assumed the role of assistant professor in the Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences at the University of California, Davis, from 1994 to 1998. He then transitioned to the position of associate professor at the same institution from 1998 to 2001. Moreover, between 2001 and 2022, he also served as a professor in the Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences at the University of California, Davis, and has been a professor emeritus there since 2022.\nVerstraete is most known for developing a teaching program in veterinary dentistry and oral surgery first at the University of Pretoria and then at the University of California – Davis.\n\n\n== Works ==\nVerstraete compiled and edited the multi-edition book Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Dogs and Cats, an illustrated guide aimed at improving surgical outcomes for these animals through collaboration between experts in human and veterinary fields. Moreover, he authored and edited two editions of the book titled Self-Assessment Colour Review of Veterinary Dentistry.\n\n\n== Research ==\nVerstraete's research has focused on various themes, including diagnostic imaging and surgery and comparative oral pathology. He pioneered the routine use of full-mouth radiography in cats and dogs, demonstrating its significant diagnostic value in identifying dental issues and informing treatment decisions, especially in older and larger dogs referred for dental treatment. He also pioneered the use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) over conventional CT in veterinary dentistry and oral surgery for assessing dental and maxillofacial anatomy in healthy rabbits, highlighting CBCT's superiority in visualizing the periodontal ligament and its potential to facilitate early detection and treatment of periodontal disease.\nVerstraete's research has made contributions in the realm of evidence-based dentistry and oral surgery. In a relevant study, he assessed the efficacy of root canal treatment in canines, determining it to be a viable approach for preserving teeth afflicted with endodontic disease, albeit with success rates that fluctuate depending on variables such as tooth type and preexisting conditions. Over the years, he has focused on comparative odontology and mammalogy. Throughout this time, he has developed methodologies for documenting dental and temporomandibular joint pathology in a variety of wild animals, with a primary emphasis on carnivores. His research encompasses different species, notably all major pinnipeds, five fox species, three bear species, two cat species, and the grey wolf.\nVerstraete's has conducted research on reconstructing dog mandibles using bone-morphogenetic protein after surgical removal (mandibulectomy). Furthermore, his publications on odontogenic cysts and oral tumour biology, specifically focusing on squamous cell carcinoma and ameloblastoma, which are also found in humans, offer insights for both canine and human healthcare. Additionally, his research in canine palatal surgery has contributed to advancements in both diagnostic imaging and evidence-based treatment approaches.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2002 – Dentistry Award, Pharmacia European Veterinary Dentistry\n2003 – AVDC Service Award, American Veterinary Dental College\n2004 – AVD Award, Veterinary Dental Forum\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nVeterinary Dentistry: Self-Assessment Color Review (1999) ISBN 9781874545934\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Dogs and Cats (2021) ISBN 9780702076756\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nVerstraete, F.

        "content": "Cochemiea schumannii is a species of Cochemiea found in Mexico.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCochemiea schumannii forms cushion-like structures, with spherical shoots that are gray-green, sometimes with a purple hue, and reach heights and diameters of 2 to 4 centimeters. The warts on the shoots are short, thick, and square at the base, lacking milky sap. Initially slightly woolly, the axillae later become glabrous. The central spine is typically one, occasionally 2 to 4, strong, pure white to dark brown, and 10 to 15 millimeters long, usually with a hooked tip. The 9 to 15 marginal spines are needle-like, thin, white, with a dark tip, and 6 to 12 millimeters long.\nThe bell-shaped, funnel-shaped, pink-red flowers are 30 to 40 millimeters in diameter, with very short flower tubes. The lanceolate sepals are pointed, and the broadly lanceolate petals have a tapering tip and a spreading edge. The style is slender, and the green to brown-pink stigma has six parts. The almost dry, scarlet fruits are 15 to 20 millimeters long and contain black seeds.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nCochemiea schumannii is found in the Cape region of Baja California Sur, Mexico. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nFirst described as Mammillaria schumannii in 1891 by Heinrich Hildmann, the specific epithet honors the German botanist and cactus specialist Karl Schumann. In 2021, Peter B. Breslin and Lucas C. Majure placed the species in the genus Cochemiea.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cochemiea schumannii at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Cochemiea schumannii at Wikispecies",

        "content": "Gnunga Gnunga Murremurgan (c.1773 – 12 January 1809), also known as Collins, was an Eora man who, in 1793–1794, was the first Indigenous Australian to travel across the Pacific Ocean, visiting Yuquot, California and Hawai'i as part of Captain George Vancouver's Pacific expedition.\n\n\n== Friendship with David Collins ==\nGnunga Gnunga first made contact with the British at the nascent military outpost of Sydney in November 1790. He immediately made a good impression on the colonists who regarded him as having an agreeable and gentle disposition. The Judge Advocate of New South Wales, David Collins, held him in particular esteem and gave him his own name of Collins, which Gnunga Gnunga readily adopted.\n\n\n== Voyage to America ==\nIn April 1793, the storeship Daedalus under the command of Lieutenant James Hanson, arrived in Sydney with orders to resupply the expedition of Captain George Vancouver which was stationed on the west coast of America. Daedalus was short of crew and the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Major Francis Grose, ordered that Gnunga Gnunga join the vessel so that he could more fully learn the English language, and that if he survived the voyage, he was to be brought back \"safe to his friends and countrymen\".\nDespite Gnunga Gnunga having a pregnant wife, Warreweer who was the sister of Bennelong, he happily boarded Daedalus on its voyage which left in early July 1793.\nDaedalus sailed across the Pacific Ocean to its agreed rendezvous point with the Vancouver expedition at Friendly Cove on Nootka Island which is now part of Canada. They arrived on 8 October 1793, but had missed Vancouver who had sailed south. After a few days at Nootka, the vessel journeyed south where they met with Vancouver's ships anchored off the Californian coast near San Francisco in late October.\nVancouver's expedition involved negotiations with the Spanish Empire over ownership of the ports on the west coast of America and his expedition was often denied full access to these ports. However, at the Presidio of Santa Barbara, his fleet was given open access and the crew, including Gnunga Gnunga, were allowed recreation at the settlement as long as they were back onboard their ships by nightfall. A large population of Indigenous Californians was located at a nearby mission and village, and these people regularly interacted with the crew of Vancouver's fleet. Vancouver wrote that they had an \"extremely pleasant\" week at Santa Barbara.  \nAfter departing Santa Barbara, the Vancouver expedition continued south, briefly visiting the Mission San Buenaventura, the Presidio of San Diego and northern Baja California. However, under instructions to return Daedalus to Sydney with provisions for that settlement, Vancouver abandoned further southerly exploration and decided to sail his fleet to Hawai'i.\n\n\n== Hawai'i ==\nVancouver's expedition arrived at Hawai'i in January 1794 where they were warmly greeted by Kamehameha the Great and provided with supplies. While there, Gnunga Gnunga conducted himself with \"the greatest propriety\" and did not incur \"the dislike or ill-will of any person on board the ship\". Like the other sailors, he \"discovered that favours from the females were to be procured at the easy exchange of a looking-glass, a nail, or a knife, he was not backward in presenting his little offering, and was as well received as any of the white people in the ship\". \nKamehameha was very impressed with Gnunga Gnunga and \"earnestly wished to detain him on the island, making splendid offers to Mr. Hanson, of canoes, warlike instruments, and other curiosities, to purchase him\". But Gnunga Gnunga was anxious to return to New South Wales and Lieutenant Hanson had promised Major Grose that he would be returned.\nWhile at Hawai'i, Gnunga Gnunga would have witnessed the negotiations between Vancouver and Kamehameha to cede Hawai'i to the British Empire, which was completed in late February. He also would have observed the execution of three O'ahu men for the killing in 1792 of Lieutenant Richard Hergest and William Gooch, former officers of Daedalus.\n\n\n== Return to New South Wales ==\nThe fully supplied Daedalus under the command of Lieutenant Hanson, left Hawai'i in February 1794 with Gnunga Gnunga on board bound for New South Wales. After stopping at Norfolk Island, the vessel arrived in Sydney in April 1794.\nOn his arrival at Sydney, it was found that Gnunga Gnunga did not acquire much English during the voyage. He did find out, however, that his wife had given birth to their daughter (who soon after died in early infancy) but had also acquired a new husband, an Aboriginal man named Wyatt. In a ritual contest, Gnunga Gnunga wounded Wyatt with a spear and thus Warreweer \"became the prize of the victor\".\nIn December 1795, Gnunga Gnunga fought another ritual battle in Sydney, this time with the great Bidjigal warrior, Pemulwuy. Gnunga Gnunga lost this contest and received a barbed spear in \"his loins close by the vertebrae of the back\". British surgeons could not remove the spear and for several weeks he was seen \"walking about with the spear unmoved\". His wife, Warreeweer, later apparently dislodged the barbed tip with her teeth and although Gnunga Gnunga recovered, the incident left him disabled for the rest of his life.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nOn 12 January 1809, Gnunga Gnunga was found dead behind the Dry Store (present day Macquarie Place Park in Sydney), the cause of death believed to be related to his injuries inflicted by Pemulwuy.\nHe was remembered \"for the docility of his temper, and the high estimation in which he was universally held among the native tribes, he had extended to many an orphan a fostering hand, and, as his own children, provided for their infant wants\". Gnunga Gnunga was also \"much esteemed by every white man who knew him, as well on account of his personal bravery, of which we had witnessed many distinguishing proofs, as on account of a gentleness of manners which strongly marked his disposition\".\nTwo visual representations of Gnunga Gnunga made during his lifetime are known to exist. One is a painting by convict artist Thomas Watling and the other is an engraving created by French artist Nicolas-Martin Petit who visited Sydney in 1802. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\n\n\n== References ==",

Matches were played between August 2007 and June 2008.\n12 teams were originally invited to contested the championship, with Queen's Park and Vale of Clyde, winners and runners-up respectively in the 2006–07 SWFL First Division, taking the places of relegated Lochee United and Hutchison Vale. However, Newburgh withdrew and folded in September 2007 (their two matches were declared void), leaving the division with 11 teams to play out the campaign. This was the first season played by Celtic in women's football, with the club having taken over existing SWPL members Arsenal North in June 2007.\nGlasgow City won the championship to qualify for the 2008–09 UEFA Women's Cup by a margin of five points ahead of holders Hibernian, the only team to take points from them. Glasgow City became mathematically certain of the championship with a narrow 2–1 victory over their Edinburgh rivals on the penultimate matchday, the winning goal scored by Ruesha Littlejohn; it was their second title (their first coming in 2004–05) and was the starting point of what became a run of 14 consecutive SWPL championships. With Newburgh's place already vacated for the following season, the only team to be relegated was Vale of Clyde, who only gained one point from their 20 fixtures. \n\n\n== League standings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLeague Results :- Season 2007 - 2008 at Spartans FC Women\nWomen's League Competitions at Scottish Football Historical Archive",

Greater Chittagong refers to the Chittagong District, Cox's Bazar District, Rangamati District, Khagrachari District and Bandarban District. The city has a brief history of education.\nWhen the decline of Nalanda University began in the sixth century, Pandit Vihara was established in Chittagong in the tenth century. Where Buddhist scholars such as Luipada, Sabripa, Ladpa, Avadhutpa etc. used to study.\nPersian was the official language of Chittagong till 1838. After learning Arabic, Muslims and wealthy Hindus learned Persian. But spread of Bengali among Muslims was less. Religious education was common among Muslims. Muslim students used to learn Arabic from the teacher Maulana or Muezzin. Muazzins were known as miazi, mizzi. Their school was called Mizzi Daras. During the Mughal Empire period, Muslim teachers were allotted free land. Muslim girls did not go to school and ended their education with primary education. Upper caste Hindus received education. But lower caste Hindus did not receive education.\n\n\n== Educational Institution ==\n\n\n=== List of educational institutions based on establishment date ===\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released on 17 April 2024 as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album Romance.\nThe song was the band's first entry on the UK Singles Chart, debuting at No. 62.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song was written about a panic attack that frontman Grian Chatten suffered at London's St Pancras station.\nNME described \"Starburster\" as a \"pensive art-rock beast that fuses elements of electronica and hip-hop\". Consequence labeled it \"trip-hop-infused\" with \"hip-hop-esque production\" that frames Fontaines D.C. \"as much more than just a gang of Irish rockers.\" Rolling Stone believed it to be a \"funky, disco-rock track\". Clash wrote of its construction: \"An elegant string loop precedes tasteful piano before being consumed by a bulky trip-hop beat.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNME gave \"Starburster\" a five-star review, praising how it \"captures that shock of trying to grasp reality amidst all the chaos.\" The Irish Times rated it four stars out of five, comparing it to Shygirl, The Prodigy and Björk's song \"Army of Me\". Consequence bestowed the \"Song of the Week\" honor to the track for its \"remarkably well-constructed composition, one that pushes the band into new, unexpected places.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video was released with the song, directed by Aube Pierre. It features Grian Chatten performing mundane daily activities while wounded and sometimes wearing a mask.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Starburster\" debuted at No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart, the band's first entry.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) is the upcoming twelfth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It is set to be released in summer of 2024, through Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEminem released his eleventh studio album Music to Be Murdered By on January 17, 2020, to highly commercial success, as well as a deluxe edition on December 18 of that same year, called Music to Be Murdered By – Side B. On August 5, 2022, the rapper released the compilation Curtain Call 2, a continuation to his 2005 greatest hits album Curtain Call: The Hits. A return of Slim Shady was first teased on New Year's Day 2023 with no further details. In an interview with DJ Whoo Kid for Shade 45 in January 2024, Eminem stated that he was \"working on a little something\". He also shut down rumors about a possible 50 Cent joint album, even though he liked the idea of it. On March 19, 2024, long-time producer and collaborator Dr. Dre, while on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, revealed that Eminem was working on his next studio album and that it would be releasing in 2024.\nOn April 26, 2024, during the 2024 NFL draft event in his hometown Detroit, the rapper shared a video in the style of real crime show Unsolved Mysteries that poses the question \"who killed Slim Shady?\", referring to the rapper's alter ego. A reporter dressed in a trenchcoat lists the enemies Shady has made over the years with rapper 50 Cent commenting on the persona. The teaser also incorporated clips of \"My Name Is\" (1999), \"Without Me\" (2002) and \"The Real Slim Shady\" (2000). The album and tentative release date were announced at the end of the 56-second long video, along with the opportunity to pre-save the record.\n\n\n== References ==",

Aidh bin Mar'i was from the Yazid clan of the Banu Mughaidi tribe, hence the epithet al-Yazidi.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nAidh bin Mar'i took power after the demise of Ali bin Mujathal al-Mughaidi as the latter had already designated him as his successor. Like his predecessor, Aidh bin Mar'i fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire who were garrisoned in Arabia. He fought against the forces of the Sharif of Makkah, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Mu'in, but was defeated; the conflicts went on until they brokered peace amongst themselves.\nAidh bin Mar'i was fond of construction; he built a large number of mosques and fortresses in 'Asir.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died in 1857, and was ultimately succeeded by his son Muhammad bin Aidh.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAl Aidh Emirate\nAli bin Mujathal al-Mughaidi\nOttoman-Wahhabi War\n\n\n== References ==",

This event is not officially recognized by the AFA.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nAn official event, but not yet officially certified by the FSHF, recently discovered by historians and print media archives, this is the 1st National Tournament played in Albania. The newspaper \"Zgim e C'qipiria\", directed by Abdyl Kadri, dated 21.04.1911, pg 2, art 174, writed: A big fair is held in Rahije in Fier. They had come to this fair from Tirana, Elbasan, Kavaja, Peqin and other places. To collect the country's money that we, the sellers, the landowner had marked Mydyri's daughter. Many people gathered here, where on this occasion a sports activity took place, top`kambe, with teams formed by citizens and countrymen from these cities, a total of 8 teams that competed in this new game, to win a reward, which was worth 6 gold coins. All matches were played in a single-game elimination system. The 1st round was the quarter-final, which was played between April 7 & 10, 1911, then the semi-final matches were played on April 11 & 12, to close the activity with the final match played on April 14, 1911. They took 8 teams in total and all matches were played in Rahije in Fier. Tirana was declared the winner of this tournament. The cup and the award were received by the captain of Tirana, Zyber Hallulli.\n\n\n== Quarter Finals ==\n8 participating teams entered this round.

It is 513 million light-years away from the solar system and has an approximate diameter of 256,000 thousand light-years meaning it is larger compared to the Milky Way. NGC 5683 was discovered by George Johnstone Stoney on April 13, 1850.\nNGC 5683 happens to lie near to a spiral galaxy NGC 5682, but they are far apart from each other. Nearby is another galaxy NGC 5689.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 5683 has an active galactic nucleus which presents strong x-rays. It is a Seyfert 1 type galaxy and such falls into the Markarian catalogue as Mrk 474, which its core shines in ultraviolet rays.  The most accepted theory for this energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around its supermassive black hole. It also shows high amounts of strong emission-lines which are mostly attributed to short-lived star formation in its regions likely restricted to a nuclear disk with its radius less than few hundred parsecs.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nType la supernova SN2002db was discovered on May 18, 2002, in NGC 5683 by a collaboration of astronomers and Reiki Kushida from LOTOSS (Lick Observatory and Tenagra Observatory Supernova Searches). It was positioned 8 arcsecs west and 9 arcsecs north of the nucleus, with a magnitude of 17.6.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On September 18, 1996, 26 special troops and crew members from the North Korean Ministry of People's Armed Forces' Reconnaissance Bureau infiltrated the area after a North Korean shark-class submarine ran aground on the coast of Aninjin-myeon, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNorth Korea's submarine infiltration campaign has been in full swing since 1994. Since 1994, North Korea has deployed submarines for espionage, and infiltrated spies in Seogwipo in September 1995.The purpose of the armed men's infiltration into Gangneung in September 1996 was to assassinate President Kim Young-sam around the opening of the National Sports Festival to be held in Chuncheon, Gangwon-do on October 7, 1996. At that time, North Korea held an armed protest at Panmunjom after declaring in a statement by the North Korean People's Army that it would not comply with regulations related to the Demilitarized Zone due to dissatisfaction with the South Korea-U.S.joint military drills in the East Sea of South Korea. It is also presumed that he tried to overcome the crisis through military action because he had a sense of crisis about social chaos caused by food shortages in North Korea, the possibility of regime collapse, and discussions on absorptive reunification in South Korea.\n\n\n== Progress and results ==\nOn September 18, 1996, a taxi driver who was driving on a coastal road near Aninjin-ri, Gangdong-myeon, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do, found the winners of the move and the ship stranded on the coast and reported it to the police. As the stranded ship was identified as a small North Korean submarine, soldiers, police, and reservists began a 49-day sweep, capturing one armed spy alive, killing 13 people, and capturing 4,380 pieces of oil, including anti-tank rockets. In addition, the bodies of 11 crew members were found who were believed to have been killed by their own operation team in accordance with North Korea's orders. On the Korean side, 11 soldiers, two police and reservists, and four civilians were killed. According to the interrogation of the captors, the infiltration secretaries were made up of a total of 26 military officers, including operatives, guides, and crew members, belonging to the 22nd squadron of the North Korean Ministry of People's Armed Forces' Reconnaissance Bureau. The 300-ton shark-class submarine they used for the infiltration was 35 meters long and 3.8 meters wide and was adapted for special operations. Based on the captors' statements and portable equipment, the purpose of their infiltration was to collect data on major facilities such as airfields and power plants and to test our military's alert posture.\n\n\n== References ==",

As of 2024, 132,265 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1996 after being reorganized from the Dobong C constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Gangbuk A has more often elected members of centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency. Kim Won-gil of the centrist-liberal National Congress for New Politics was the first member to represent the constituency. Kim won re-election in 2000 as a member of the centre-left Millennium Democratic Party, but joined the conservative Grand National Party ahead of the 2002 South Korean presidential election. Kim ran as the Grand National Party's nominee for Gangbuk A in the 2004 election, but was defeated by Oh Yeong-sik of the liberal Uri Party by more than ten points. In the following election, Oh was defeated by Cheong Yang-seog of the Grand National Party. However, in the 2012 election, Oh won back the seat in a rematch against Cheong.

        "content": "Aegis: The First Mission is a 3D action role-playing video game developed and published by Bbmf. It is a prequel to Atlus's 2006 game Persona 3, and part of the Persona series, itself a part of the larger Megami Tensei series. It was originally released for Japanese feature phones on October 29, 2007, after which it became unavailable for years and was considered lost, until G-Mode announced a re-release for Nintendo Switch and Windows as part of their G-Mode Archives+ line as Persona 3 Aegis: The First Mission.\nThe story takes place ten years prior to the events of Persona 3, and follows the humanoid robot Aigis as she battles enemies during an incident at the Kirijo Ergonomics Research Laboratory on the Japanese island Yakushima. The game was well received for its action gameplay, story, and visuals, particularly for the aesthetics of the environments.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nAegis: The First Mission is a action role-playing game in which players take the role of the humanoid robot Aigis, who can run and jump in 3D, and battle enemies while exploring the research laboratory, nature scenes on the island of Yakushima, and dungeons. They have access to three weapon types: a gun, a grenade launcher, and a drill for melee combat. These can be upgraded by visiting the research laboratory, increasing the amount of damage they deal and adding new functions, such as letting the player shoot bullets in a wider spread. The player can also buy armor and other items in the laboratory, and can find new foot equipment in treasure chests throughout the game.\nIn addition to using weapons, the player can spend soul points (SP) to use Aigis's persona Palladion to activate offensive and supportive skills; this is at times necessary, as some enemies are immune to her weapons. Defeating enemies earns the player money and experience points, raising Aigis's level; as her level goes up, Palladion learns more skills.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\nAegis: The First Mission is set on the Japanese island Yakushima over six days in May 1999, ten years prior to the events of Persona 3. It follows the humanoid robot Aigis's early life during an incident at the Kirijo Ergonomics Research Laboratory, together with her trainer Sota Aizawa (相沢 総太, Aizawa Sōta) and the chief scientist Yu Kimijima (君嶋 夕, Kimijima Yū).\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nAegis: The First Mission was developed and published by Bbmf for Japanese feature phones starting on October 29, 2007, through the mobile game distribution service Megaten Alpha. After the original feature phone release, the game became unavailable; video game preservationists tried to find phones from the time with the game still installed, but were unsuccessful. It was considered lost until 2024, when G-Mode announced their plans to publish it for Nintendo Switch and Windows as the 100th game in their G-Mode Archives+ line of mobile game re-releases, having received many requests for it from fans. G-Mode's version was re-built in the game engine Unity, rather than using emulation, and is published as Persona 3 Aegis: The First Mission.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAegis: The First Mission was well received by critics, who recommended it to Persona 3 players. RPGFan liked the action gameplay, saying that it exceeded their expectations and had responsive and smooth controls for a mobile game, although found the weapons unbalanced, describing the drill and grenade launcher as useless. They found the story fun and the characters likeable but flat, with Kimijima as the one exception: they considered her well-developed, and enjoyed the story thread of her dealing with questions about existence and the value of life, while the other characters primarily existed to support her development, wishing that Aigis had been more integral to the story.\nThe game's aesthetics and graphics were well received: Dengeki Online liked the game's \"beautiful\" 3D world, and RPGFan considered it aesthetically impressive, with character models on around the same level as the 1997 game Final Fantasy VII, and scenic environments such as nature areas and psychedelic dungeons.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

        "content": "RE 1.224.374 was a case of the Supreme Court of Brazil concerning the constitutionality of penalizing refusal to submit oneself to drug influence tests on traffic stops, such as a breathalyzer. The case's rapporteur, minister Luiz Fux, cast the initial vote and the Court unanimously agreed, upholding the constitutionality of such penalties.\nThe case was judged alongside ADI 4017 and ADI 4103, both regarding the constitutionality of prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages alongside highways and its inspection by the Highway Police.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe case was brought to the Supreme Court after the Transit State Department of Rio Grande do Sul challenged a decision by the state's Court of Justice (TJ-RS) to reverse penalties imposed upon a driver that refused a breathalyzer test.\nSpecifically, the case put into question the constitutionality of Article 165-A of the Brazilian Transit Code:\n\nThe argument against the constitutionality of the article was that penalizing the refusal to test for inebriation would restrict the accused's defense, and could lead to self-incrimination.\n\n\n== High Court decision ==\nThe Court unanimously ruled that, since the refusal does not constitute a crime and is instead only penalized by administrative sanctions, there is no violation of the principle of no self-incrimination. Additionally, it was decided that sanctioning test refusal is an effective means of enforcing the law.\n\n\n=== Judiciary representation ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDriving under the influence\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRE 1.224.374 updates on the Supreme Court's website\nLaw 9.503/1997, the Brazilian Transit Code",

        "content": "Roberto Augusto Izurieta Canoba (Montevideo, 1963)  is an Ecuadorian professor, political strategist and diplomat of Uruguayan origin. Was the Secretary of Communication of Ecuador, during the governments of Daniel Noboa, previously was the Secretary of Communication during the government of Jamil Mahuad, from 1998 to 2000. He was also Ecuador's ambassador to Chile (from 2022 to 2023) and a professor at George Washington University for more than two decades.\nAs a political strategist, he has worked as an advisor to presidents such as the Ecuadorian Guillermo Lasso, the Peruvian Alejandro Toledo, the Mexican Vicente Fox and the Guatemalan Álvaro Colom. His political work has earned him recognitions such as the Rising Star award from the American magazine Campaigns and Elections, from which he was the first Latin American to receive it.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in January 1963 in Montevideo, Uruguay, a country where his father had traveled to study veterinary medicine. He moved to Ecuador during the dictatorship of Guillermo Rodríguez Lara and completed his secondary studies in Quito at the San Gabriel and Spellman schools, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1981. He completed his higher education at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, where he completed the degree in economics, and later studied a master's degree in political science at Southern Illinois University Carbondale through a Fulbright scholarship.\nAfter moving to the United States, he began working in 2001 as a professor at George Washington University, where he taught for the next two decades and was also director of Latin American projects at the Graduate School of Political Management.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nDuring the government of President Jamil Mahuad (1998–2000), he served as Secretary of Communication of Ecuador. Izurieta had already collaborated with Mahuad previously, during the politician's campaign for the 1992 Quito mayoral election.\nOn December 8, 2022, he was appointed by President Guillermo Lasso as Ecuador's ambassador to Chile, for which he had to leave his position as a political analyst on the program Choque de opiniones, on the CNN en Español. As Ecuador's ambassador to Chile, he was decorated with the Order of Merit of Chile, in the Degree of Grand Cross, by the Chilean government upon his departure from office.\nIn November 2023, he was appointed Secretary of Communication by President Daniel Noboa. due to the results of the 2024 Ecuadorian constitutional referendum, the president Daniel Noboa made some changes in his presidential cabinet, which led to his resignation and at the same time Noboa appointed Irene Vélez as his replacement in the ministerial portfolio, ending 5 months his presence in the presidential cabinet.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIzurieta has been openly homosexual since he was 19, which made him decide against pursuing a career as a politician, given the prejudices in Ecuador at the time. Since 1982, Izurieta began attending clandestine LGBT bars in Quito with some of his friends. friends, like Luis Miguel Campos. Among the bars he visited was El Hueco, an establishment that, according to Izurieta, received that nickname after he himself named it this way because of how difficult it was to access.\nDue to the criminalization of homosexuality, which at that time carried a sentence of four to six years in prison in the country, Izurieta experienced police raids on LGBT bars in Quito on several occasions, which ended with many of those who did not manage to escape arrested. During the process to achieve the decriminalization of homosexuality, which was achieved in 1997, Izurieta collaborated with the Tolerance Group and was one of the people who participated in collecting signatures of support.\nIn 2010, Izurieta and his partner, American Paul Quirk, registered their de facto union in a notary office in Ecuador.  However, they could not get the Civil Registry to register the union. The same year, they were married in Washington D.C. In 2022, with same-sex marriage already recognized in the country, they were legally married in Ecuador.\nOn November 23, 2023, Izurieta attended the presidential inauguration of Daniel Noboa with her husband. The event provoked homophobic messages on social networks from users who insulted Izurieta for holding hands with her husband, even though heterosexual couples did the same.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sims 2  is a 2005 life simulation video game developed by Amaze Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts for the Nintendo DS. Development of the game began following the success of The Sims 2 for personal computers. The handheld versions of The Sims 2 were the final games in the Sims series to be developed by Amaze Entertainment following The Sims Bustin' Out and The Urbz: Sims in the City. The game, written by Darby McDevitt, was noted for its dark plot and absurdist humor, and received mixed reviews from critics upon release.\n\n\n== Gameplay and plot ==\nThe Sims 2 begins with a character editor where the player selects the Sim's gender, name, and appearance. The Sim is assigned as the manager of the only hotel in the deserted area of the town of Strangetown. The Sim must maintain cleanliness and order in the hotel; from time to time, hotel visitors will make different wishes, which the Sim must fulfill in order to increase their rating. At the same time, different events will take place in Strangetown and the problems must be solved by the Sim. The town periodically suffers from attacks by aliens who consider the hot and arid surroundings of Strangetown ideal for colonization, since they themselves are afraid of water, requiring the Sim to stop this threat. In some situations, the Sim will have to engage in battle with supernatural creatures.\nThe gameplay is tied to the need to earn money in different ways, which can be obtained by completing mini-quests, collecting items in the desert and doing odd jobs; if the Sim fulfills all the desires and whims of hotel visitors, they will pay more. An equally important element of the game is the need to satisfy the basic needs of the Sim for food and hygiene; if these are ignored, the Sim will have a nervous breakdown and will not be able to complete quests and maintain dialogues at the proper level. As the plot develops, the Sim unravels new secrets of the town. The game offers mini-games, the ability to create music and draw pictures.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe Nintendo DS version of The Sims 2, like other versions for game consoles and handheld devices, was developed following the success of the original version for personal computers. Despite sharing a title, the Nintendo DS version is a reimagined linear progression game with graphics adapted to run on a smaller device. The Nintendo DS version was developed by Amaze Entertainment, and the handheld versions of The Sims 2 and would be the final games in the franchise developed by them.\nWhen developing the previous three Game Boy Advance games, Amaze Entertainment strived to make their plots as strange as possible, introducing dark and disturbing plots featuring an abundance of dark and absurdist humor, and this bar was raised with each new subsequent project. According to producer J.C. Connors, the Nintendo DS version ended up with the strangest plot-based humor of any game. However, some ideas were not approved by Electronic Arts; for example, the developers wanted to introduce the concept that the player controls the game character from the point of view of a parasitic amoeba that controls the character's brain. Lead writer Darby McDevitt suggested using the hotel as the main setting, drawing inspiration from the TV series Fawlty Towers. McDevitt later mentioned that working on strange stories for The Sims games allowed him to gain writing experience for future successful game projects. Connors noted that the plot was inspired by the novels of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, especially the novel It, but also noted that the PC version itself offered mysterious background stories that aroused widespread interest among fans of the game, specifically mentioning the disappearance of Bella Goth.\nThe soundtrack for The Sims 2 was jointly created by composers Ian Stocker of Ian Stocker Sound Design and Kyle Johnson of Moontech Studios, who collaborated online to compose music for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions. Ian had previously been an independent composer and director contracting with Amaze Entertainment when he was briefed to compose the music for The Sims 2. To reflect the game's setting, Stocker created Western-style compositions featuring live guitar performances by Johnson. Stocker and Johnson collaborated while respectively living in San Francisco and Santa Barbara. Initially, Stocker composed the melody using the Buzz and Impulse Tracker programs, then Johnson accompanied it with a guitar performance, attaching it to the track using Audio Hijack Pro. While working on the opening theme, Johnson and Stocker recorded a melody styled after \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\". Stocker not only created melodies, but also used the guitar to create various sound effects. Due to the technical limitations of the Nintendo DS and especially the Game Boy Advance, Stocker was unable to include a full soundtrack in the game, so the tracks were recorded in 10-20 second sample format, which were then used to recreate the tracks.\nThe Sims 2 was released in North America on October 24, 2005, and in Europe on November 4.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Sims 2 was met with \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nVincent Anderson of Nintendo World Report concluded that the abundance of micromanagement was satisfying without becoming overwhelming. Craig Harris of IGN compared the game's structure to Animal Crossing and considered the plot too linear, though he praised the accessible interface.\nThe strangeness of the handheld versions of The Sims 2 was discussed in a retrospective piece by Leah J. Williams of Kotaku. Users on Reddit have noted the game's empty and oppressive atmosphere and abundance of cruel humor and ambiguous scenes, such as when the player character, on behalf of a mobster, must bury a wriggling suitcase. Some users complained of psychologically traumatic experiences, while others appreciated the dark humor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchived official website (October 2005)",

        "content": "The A420 derby is a football match played between Oxford United and Swindon Town. It takes its name from A420 road, a primary road between both cities, which are only 30 miles (48 km) apart.\nAlthough both the clubs played friendly matches throughout 1950s, the rivalry began when Oxford United replaced the bankrupt Accrington Stanley in the Football League. The rivalry was at its peak in the 1970s since both the teams were in the same divisions for majority of the decade.\nOccasionally, the derby has been marred with the violence, especially during 1970s, when football hooliganism was on its peak. The most notable incident being on 4 May 1982, when a smoke bomb thrown on the pitch from Swindon Town's fan with the score tied at 2–2, the match referee in confusion continued the game on a foggy pitch and Swindon Town scored the winning goal as the match ended 3–2 in Swindon Town's favour. After the final whistle, the referee was struck by a coin from Oxford United's fan and chaos ensued afterwards. The teams have played 62 matches in all competitions, Swindon winning 24, Oxford 17 and remaining 20 having been drawn. Even though Swindon won more derby matches than Oxford, the latter have an unbeaten streak of 18 years, spanning from 2002 to 2020.\n\n\n== Head-to-head ==\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nAs of 26 April 2024\n\n\n=== List of matches ===\nAs of 26 April 2024\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Records ===\nWidest winning margin: 5 goals – Oxford United 5–0 Swindon Town (7 April 1982, 1981–82 Third Division)\nHighest scoring match: 8 goals – Oxford United 5–3 Swindon Town (7 March 1992, 1991–92 Second Division)\nLongest winning streak: 6 matches – Oxford United (8 December 2002 – 10 September 2016)\nLongest unbeaten streak: 12 matches – Swindon Town (20 October 1973 – 1 October 1980)\nHighest attendance:\nSwindon Town: 20,596 – Swindon Town 0–0 Oxford United (21 August 1965, 1965–66 Third Division)\nOxford United: 18,012 – Oxford United 0–0 Swindon Town (12 April 1968, 1967–68 Third Division)\n\n\n=== Goal scoring ===\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\n\n\n== Crossing the divide ==\nList of players that played for both teams.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOxford United v Swindon Town rivalry explained at bbc.com\nWhy do Oxford and Swindon Town hate each other? at football365.com",

        "content": "Global Disinformation Index (GDI) is a not-for-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom which aims to mitigate the spread of disinformation on the internet. The group utilises a system of ratings of news sources and websites to determine risk of disinformation. The group's efforts also include investigations into internet advertising, and the alleged use of disinformation in relation to COVID-19 featured on various websites. The group has faced scrutiny over potential political bias, and has been categorised as a political left think tank by the group AllSides.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nGDI was founded in 2018 by Clare Melford and Daniel Rogers, and has received funding through a combination of charitable trusts, governmental organizations, and ad tech licensees of its dynamic exclusion list. Contributors include the Knight Foundation, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), and Luminate Group.\nA strategy promoted by GDI is the aim to remove financial incentives for news content that promotes adversarial narratives. GDI's investigation of COVID-19 disinformation focussed on the generation of illicit revenue for websites.\nGDI has reported that a recent evaluation of Italian online news sites resulted in categorising one third of the evaluated sites as high risk of disinformation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNewsGuard\nAd Fontes Media\nAllSides\n\n\n== References ==",

It contains one species, Cretalepisma kachinicum. Cretalepisma is known from a single female specimen, preserved in Cretaceous aged Burmese amber. The specimen has a total body length (including paracercum) of 9.7 millimeters, almost twice that of Burmalepisma (the only other Zygentoma known from the same deposits).\nThe genus name Cretalepisma is derived from the Latin Creta (chalk) as used in the name of the Cretaceous period, and from Lepisma. The species epithet kachinicum references Kachin, the northernmost state of Myanmar, where the Burmese amber mines are located.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The visit of Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler to Spain in October 1940 had a major propaganda component for the Francoist regime, which at that time was invested in a diplomatic rapprochement with Nazi Germany with the anticipation of Spain's entry into World War II in support of the Axis powers. Himmler's stay in Spain took place between 19 and 24 October. It was one of the very few trips that the Nazi leader made to neutral countries.\n\n\n== The course of the visit ==\nHimmler had accepted the invitation extended by Director General of Security José Finat y Escrivá de Romaní, whom he had met in Berlin in August of that year. The main purpose of the visit was to inspect the Spanish security forces, discuss Spanish-German police cooperation, and prepare for the planned meeting between Franco and Hitler. However, the official version at the time depicted this visit more like a mere tourist trip.\nHimmler was accompanied by a German entourage, including close collaborators such as Karl Wolff and Joachim Peiper. On the morning of 19 October, the Nazi leader entered the country via the border control checkpoint at Irun, where he was received by, among others, the director general of security; the commander of the Sixth Military Region, General José López-Pinto Berizo; the German ambassador to Spain, Eberhard von Stohrer; the head of the Gestapo in Madrid, Paul Winzer; and the president of the Nazi Party in Spain, Hans Thomsen. Shortly after crossing the border, he stopped in San Sebastián, where he was the guest of honor of the local authorities and visited various sites. He made another stop in Burgos and visited its famous cathedral. While in this city, he met and had dinner with Franco.\n\nOn the morning of 20 October, he arrived at the Estación del Norte railway station in Madrid, where he was received by a military retinue, the German ambassador in Madrid and Ramón Serrano Suñer. In the streets of the capital city, decorated with Nazi flags, he was received by Falangists in uniform and members of the Armed Police Corps. The regime's official newspaper, Arriba, was not sparing of praise for the foreign dignitary, going so far as to comment con hombres como Himmler llegan a su cenit los Estados fuertes. After meeting with Serrano Suñer at the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry, Franco received him at the Royal Palace of El Pardo. The Spanish dictator, who—according to British Ambassador Samuel Hoare—had received Himmler like a \"sovereign prince,\" made a poor impression on the Nazi leader. Himmler later attended a bullfight offered in his honor at the Las Ventas ring, organized by José Finat himself. As the newspaper of the Nazi Party, Völkischer Beobachter, reported it, he was greeted with great applause upon his arrival. Bullfighters Pepe Luis Vázquez, Marcial Lalanda, and Rafael Ortega Gómez (Gallito) took part in the bullfight. The head of the SS was horrified by what he saw and would later express his displeasure with the bullfight, referring to it as a \"cruel\" spectacle.\nSerrano Suñer used this visit to boost his political position within the regime. Since he was not satisfied with the coverage by the regime's press outlets, he gave instructions to Enrique Giménez-Arnau—the general director of the press—so that newspapers such as ABC, Ya, or Arriba would [estar] a la altura de las circunstancias.\n\nThe following day, Himmler traveled to El Escorial and to the former capital of the Visigothic Kingdom, Toledo, where he toured the ruins of the Alcázar. Spanish archaeologist Julio Martínez Santa-Olalla, an ardent Nazi sympathizer, was assigned to the entourage and accompanied Himmler during these visits. In the evening, the head of the SS attended a dinner at the Hotel Ritz in Madrid, organized by José Finat, at which the top Falangist officials were also in attendance. In the morning of 22 October, Himmler paid a visit to the Prado Museum, the headquarters of Falangist aid organization Auxilio Social, and the National Archaeological Museum—where he meticulously studied a map of the Germanic invasions—and then in the afternoon, gave a speech at the Madrid headquarters of the Nazi Party. During his speech, Himmler announced that \"all Jews from the Greater Germanic Reich would be placed in a 'closed ghetto' in the General Government.\"\nAfter their stay in the capital, the German entourage headed to Barcelona by plane. In the morning of 23 October, Himmler landed in El Prat Airport, where he was received by military and civilian authorities. Accompanied by the Captain General of Catalonia, General Luis Orgaz Yoldi, and Barcelona Mayor Miguel Mateu y Pla, he attended a folklore presentation at the Poble Espanyol in Montjuïc. In Barcelona, Himmler and his entourage stayed at the Ritz. At around 3:30 p.m., the entourage went to visit the Montserrat Abbey, well known in relation to the Holy Grail tradition.  In fact, Himmler firmly believed that Montserrat was really the \"Monsalvat\" depicted in Richard Wagner's opera Parsifal. One of the monks, Andreu Ripoll Noble, was the only one who could speak German and thus he served as interpreter for the group of visitors. Himmler—who on several occasions explained to the monks the Germanic and pagan origin of Montserrat—asked to see the archives related to the location of the Holy Grail, although the monks pointed out to him that it was not there. Upon their return to Barcelona, the members of the entourage visited the German consulate and later attended a dinner hosted by the City Council. After the dinner, Himmler and other Francoist leaders visited a former Republican checa located in Vallmajor street. The following day, he boarded a plane and returned to Germany.\nIt so happened that while the Nazi leader was in Barcelona, his portfolio, carrying secret documents, went missing.\n\n\n== Significance and transcendence ==\nDuring his tour around Spain, Himmler also visited some prisons and Francoist concentration camps. The Nazi leader was stunned by the magnitude and harshness of the Francoist repression. Nonetheless, his reaction was not motivated by humanitarian reasons. Rather, by the fact that he believed the level of repression was \"politically\" counterproductive and also because of how absurd it was to exterminate valuable labor when there was an urgent need for workers in order to rebuild the country. In light of the depressed atmosphere that Himmler found during his stay in the capital, he recommended Franco and Serrano Suñer to turn the page \"so as to prevent all national life from continuing to revolve around the national tragedy.\"\nHimmler held several meetings with Serrano, after which they reached an agreement to strengthen the political and police cooperation between both countries: the Gestapo would open an office at the German Embassy in Madrid and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) would establish delegations in each German consulate in Spanish soil, while the Nazi agents acting in the Spanish territory would have diplomatic immunity. In return, Spanish agents acting in Germany and occupied France would also have immunity. Likewise, Himmler made sure that one of his deputies who was already operating in the country, Paul Winzer, would train the new Spanish secret police. These agreements would ultimately join the one signed in 1938, which provided for the mutual extradition of detainees between both countries and the establishment of an SD network. Apart from police matters, some issues related to Nazi propaganda in Spain were also discussed.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMeeting at Hendaye\nJewish Archive (Francoist Spain)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGracia Alonso, Francisco (2008). \"Relations between Spanish Archaeologists and Nazi Germany (1939–1945): A preliminary examination of the influence of Das Ahnenerbe in Spain\" (PDF).

        "content": "Gio (born 8 June 1999), known professionally as p-rallel, is a British electronic music producer and DJ. A member of musical collective Elevation/Meditation, he has worked with such artists as Slowthai and Playboi Carti.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGio was born on the June 6, 1999, in Acton to a family of Jamaican and Bajan heritage.  He has described his parents as \"ravers\"; his father and grandfather are both musicians, with his father working as a multi-genre DJ performing under the name Touchtee. He started playing piano at six years old.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Pre-2016 - Boy Blue Entertainment ===\nWhile having been a part of a steel pan group as early as 2012, Gio's primary focus before music was dancing, which he picked up at nine years old. He performed with the group Boy Blue Entertainment, where he was inspired by the group's music producer, as well as their choreographer. His last performance with the group was in 2015 in the Barbican Centre.\n\n\n=== 2016-2018 - The Soul Trip ===\nAs a teenager he would respond to Twitter callouts looking for studio sessions, which led to him having a studio session at his parents' house with Rejjie Snow and Playboi Carti when he was sixteen. He also worked with Zach Fox as a DJ, and eventually ran sessions in Lily Allen's London studio. He founded the collective Elevation/Meditation, which mainly operated from the studio he had built in his bedroom.\nGio's stage name, p-rallel, comes from the concept of parallel theory. His first EP, called The Soul Trip, came out in September 2016 and included Lord Apex among its features. Before being signed to a label he released several singles on Spotify with fellow Elevation/Meditation member Finn Foxell.\n\n\n=== 2019-2021 - Different Recordings ===\nIn October of 2019, Gio was signed to Different Recordings. His first work under them was his second EP In Due Time, featuring Lava La Rue and Sam Wise. His second and final project with Different Records was his third EP Soundboy, which featured Greentea Peng, Venna, Louis Culture, Nayana Iz and Lord Apex. The remix of his song with Greentea Peng, \"soulboy\", by producer IZCO is his most popular song on Spotify.\n\n\n=== 2021-present - Black Butter Records ===\nAfter releasing the single \"Blue Denim Jeans\" with Lauren Faith (later remixed by Nia Archives), Gio switched labels to 4ZA Music/Black Butter Records. He then began his next release cycle for his fourth EP Forward, which alongside some of his former collaborators featured Jeshi, Rachel Chinouriri, and Jords. After the EP came out in 2021, Gio released two more singles with Hak Baker and Roses Gabor before starting to release songs later to be included on his first and only so far LP, the mixtape Movement. The track \"It's A Lundun Thing\" off the album, which sampled a 1997 song by Scott Garcia, became a local hit, being played in many clubs around London. The album's other songs featured Tamera and Toddla T.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nGio has cited Michael Jackson, Timbaland, Darkchild, Moodymann, Kaytranada, and Missy Elliott as major inspirations. One of the most important qualities to him in songwriting is soulfulness, and he refers to D'Angelo's \"Spanish Joint\" as being one of the best examples of this in music. He mixes a lot of genres in his music, including garage, house, jungle, reggae, amapiano, funk, soul, jazz, and rap. His music's is notably influenced by the sound of the 1990s.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n== References ==",

It was originally published by Angus and Robertson in Australia in 1995. \n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nNarita is a single-mother of Camille, living in Sydney, when she meets Stephen, a public servant who is seeking a change of lifestyle.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by Angus and Robertson in 1995, the novel was reprinted by the same company in 1996.\n\n\n== Epigraph ==\nEpigraph: \"The child's first decision, noted Freud, is whether to swallow it or spit it out.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting in The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Morag Fraser commented: \"Amanda Lohrey's Camille's Bread is all domestic interiors and friction over ritual.\" She then went on to note that \"..random riches at the novel's edges make you speculate that Lohrey has other novels in her that will prove riskier and more grand.\"\nIn The Age Lyn McCredden wrote: \"It is the sheer glory of the novel that its understated humor and subtle neo-realism deliver a feast of contemporary vignettes and characters. Each scene totters deliciously on the brink of farce but is pulled back into the narrative.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1996 ALS Gold Medal winner\n1996 Victorian Premier's Prize for Fiction winner\n1996 Miles Franklin Award, shortlisted\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfter her Victorian Premier's Prize for Fiction win in 1996, Lohrey spoke to Jason Steger of The Age.\nThe Age newspaper published a short excerpt from the novel\n1995 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Corinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company were the legal proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) which consisted of a hearing and a later rehearing, between 1989 and 1990. The issue was based on FERC Order 490, which the commission had created for the issue of abandonment of certain natural gas sales and purchases under the authority of Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA). El Paso Natural Gas had cancelled the contract for natural gas producer Grace, which was contested as not authorized by FERC regulations. The result from the hearings was that FERC decided to consider the effects of the order in terms of the effect on natural gas producers.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlong with FERC Order 490, the legal environment at that time also had the newly enacted Natural Gas Wellhead Deregulation Act of 1989 which addressed the same issues of expired and terminated natural gas contracts, creating an environment where natural gas pipelines had greater flexibility in terms of abandoning natural gas contracts from producers. Prior to the 1989 act, a sale subject to federal jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 could not be abandoned unless FERC determines it to be in the public interest.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nAlthough El Paso Natural Gas Company was considered lawful in the cancelling the contract, the hearings resulted in the following conclusion on the abandonment of natural gas contracts by pipelines with independent oil and gas producers, within the setting of the new Natural Gas Wellhead Deregulation Act of 1989 having been passed by Congress and signed by President George H. W. Bush:Order No. 490 was never intended to be an unconstrained grant of regulatory authority to interstate pipelines to terminate and abandon small producer contracts, subject only to later judicial review of the contract expiration dispute.  At a minimum, the Commission should investigate the types of serious allegations presented here by the complainant and render a decision based on the substantive merits.  As a practical matter, in the absence of such investigation, many small producers effectively will have no remedy of any kind in the event of such alleged pipeline conduct, because a contract lawsuit will be financially burdensome, if not impossible. Consequently, I urge the Commission to reconsider this policy.\n\n\n== References ==",
