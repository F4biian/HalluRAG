It is given via intravenous injection.\nPegulicianine was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2024.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\nPegulicianine is indicated for fluorescence imaging in adults with breast cancer as an adjunct for the intraoperative detection of cancerous tissue within the resection cavity following removal of the primary specimen during lumpectomy surgery.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe efficacy and safety of pegulicianine were evaluated in a multicenter, intra-participant controlled clinical trial (NCT03686215) of participants with breast cancer undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A total of 357 participants underwent image-guided surgery with the Lumicell DVS following standard of care lumpectomy. When positive pegulicianine signal was detected, the tissue was resected with a cavity shave procedure. The study assessed the proportion of participants receiving pegulicianine who had residual cancer detected and removed after the standard of care lumpectomy. A total of 27 of 357 participants (7.6%) had cancer in at least one pegulicianine-guided shave. The study also assessed the image-level sensitivity (ability to designate an imaged region with disease as positive) and specificity (ability to designate an imaged region without disease as negative) for detection of cancer in the lumpectomy cavity. Sensitivity was 49.1% and specificity was 86.5%. Forty-three percent (43%) of participants had at least one false positive image and 8% of participants had at least one false negative image.\nThe FDA granted the application for pegulicianine fast track and priority review designations.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\nPegulicianine is the international nonproprietary name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClinical trial number NCT03686215 for \"Investigation of Novel Surgical Imaging for Tumor Excision (INSITE)\" at ClinicalTrials.gov",

        "content": "Elbowoods is a ghost town that was located in McLean County, North Dakota, United States, on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. It was founded in 1889 along the Missouri River as the agency seat for the reservation of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. After the creation of the Garrison Dam and Lake Sakakawea, rising water levels threatened the town, slowly engulfing its buildings until the entire town was submerged in 1954.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nElbowoods was located in McLean County, North Dakota, and was the agency seat for the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation for the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. It was located on the floodplains near the Missouri River, at an elevation of 1,740 feet (530 m). North Dakota Route 8 ran through the town. It was located about 5 miles (8.0 km) southwest of present-day White Shield.\n\n\n== History ==\nElbowoods was first settled in 1889 as a headquarters for the reservation's agency. In 1893, a post office was established. At its peak, hundreds of people lived in Elbowoods, which included a hospital, school, gas stations, and various other businesses. Between 1936 and 1954, approximately 1,000 students attended the school and about 150 students graduated high school. The local land on the Missouri River floodplains was well-suited for agriculture, and the reservation was largely self-sufficient as a result.The 1941–1942 Elbowoods Warriors high school basketball team and their loss at the 1942 Class B state championship was the subject of a PBS documentary released in 2019. The game was played at the high school in Minot against the Lakota Raiders. One of Elbowoods's star players, John Rabbithead, turned 20 that day and per regulations set by the North Dakota High School Athletics Association (NDHSAA), had to sit out the game. Although Elbowoods led almost the entirety of the game, Lakota won by one point scored in the last minute, for a final score of 39—38. After a revelation that Lakota's team had allowed a 20-year-old to play not just during the championship but for their entire season, Elbowoods was awarded the title in October 1942, but the year's championship was voided by the NDHSAA in November 1943. The championship title was re-awarded to Elbowoods in 2002.In the 1940s, as part of the Pick–Sloan Missouri Basin Program, plans were drawn up to create the Garrison Dam, which would subsequently create Lake Sakakawea, for the purpose of providing hydroelectric power, irrigation, and recreation in the area. The project garnered heavy opposition from local Native American communities, particularly the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, as it would mean considerable loss of land and cultural resources. The floodplains including Elbowoods and much of the agricultural land would be part of that loss.Construction proceeded regardless of the opposition. In April 1953, the water was diverted towards the new dam. A ceremony celebrating the success of Garrison Dam's completion was held on June 11. The flooding took about a year to reach Elbowoods itself, and water levels began to rise very slowly. Many residents did not move until the water reached their houses. Some residents disinterred relatives buried in the cemeteries—about 1,500 in total—and reburied them on higher ground. The post office closed in the spring of 1954.The entirety of Elbowoods was eventually submerged. Residents were forced to relocate from the floodplains to the highlands, which changed their lifeways, as different crops and wildlife were available in that area. About 94–98% of the reservation's arable land was inundated, and about 20% of the reservation's total land. The newly-established New Town became the new agency seat and many former Elbowoods residents relocated there. The Four Bears Bridge was moved from its crossing at Elbowoods to New Town.Lake Sakakawea's Elbowoods Bay was named in memory of the town.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEdwin Benson (1931–2016), educator and last native speaker of the Mandan language\nRaymond Cross (1948–2023), attorney and law professor\nEdward Lone Fight (born 1939), Chairman of the Three Affiliated Tribes (1986–1990)\nAlyce Spotted Bear (1945–2013), educator and politician\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ghost towns in North Dakota\nSanish, North Dakota\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGunderson, Melford MJ W.

        "content": "The Invincible World Tour (Chinese: 地表最強世界巡迴演唱會) is the seventh concert tour by Taiwanese recording artist Jay Chou, held in support of his fourteenth studio album Jay Chou's Bedtime Stories (2016). The tour began in Shanghai at the Mercedes-Benz Arena on June 30, 2016, and spanned 120 dates in various countries including China, Malaysia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Australia, the United States, and France.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe Invincible World Tour in Taipei saw upgraded outfits, visual and special effects, and stage props. The concert was divided into eight thematic sections, each offering a different experience. The total production cost surpassed NT$180 million, making it the most expensive concert held by Chou up to that point.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nChou's concert in Singapore on September 3, 2016, faced several controversies, including poor sound quality. Attendees seated close to the stage reported difficulty discerning the vocals of the singer at certain points during the concert, attributing this to the overpowering bass and excessive reverb. In addition, allegations were made regarding inadequate ventilation and crowd management.\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\n\n\n== Live album ==\n\nThe Invincible Concert Tour (simplified Chinese: 地表最强世界巡回演唱会; traditional Chinese: 地表最強世界巡迴演唱會) is the sixth live album by Taiwanese singer Jay Chou, released on November 1, 2019, by Sony Music Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\nDVD\n\n\"Opening\" / \"Hero\" (英雄)\n\"Nunchucks\" (雙截棍)\n\"I Find It Hard To Say\" (開不了口)\n\"Bedtime Stories\" (床邊故事) featuring Devon Song & Gary Yang\n\"Ye Qu\" (夜曲) / \"Stolen Love\" (竊愛)\n\"In The Name of Father\" (以父之名)\n\"Mermaid\" (美人魚)\n\"I Want Summer\" (我要夏天) featuring Patrick Brasca\n\"My Time\" (我的時代) performed by Patrick Brasca\n\"Sunny Day\" (晴天)\n\"Rice Field\" (稻香)\n\"Blue and White Porcelain\" (青花瓷)\n\"Diary of Love\" (愛的飛行日記) performed by Gary Yang\n\"Maple Leaf\" (楓) / \"A Step Back\" (退後) / \"Step Aside\" (擱淺) performed by Devon Song\n\"Dad, I'm home\" (爸，我回來了)\n\"Extra Large Shoes\" (鞋子特大號)\n\"Peninsula Ironbox\" (半島鐵盒)\n\"Ancient Indian Turtledove\" (印第安老斑鳩)\n\"Big Ben\" (大笨鐘) / \"Secret Sign\" (暗號) / \"Rainbow\" (彩虹) / \"Tornado\" (龍捲風)\n\"Tu Er Qi Ice Cream\" (土耳其冰淇淋)\n\"How You See Me\" featuring Mai Zheng-wei\n\"Love Confession\" (告白氣球)\n\"Grandpa's Tea\" (爺爺泡的茶) featuring Patrick Brasca, Devon Song, Gary Yang, Mai Zheng-wei\n\"Qi Li Xiang\" (七里香) featuring Patrick Brasca, Devon Song, Gary Yang, Mai Zheng-wei\n\"Let's Go\" (説走就走) featuring Patrick Brasca, Devon Song, Gary Yang, Mai Zheng-wei\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJay Chou discography@JVR Music",

        "content": "Towards Asmara (1989) is a novel by Australian writer Thomas Keneally. It was originally published by Hodder and Stoughton in Australia and the United Kingdom in 1989. The novel is also known by the alternative title To Asmara.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe novel follows a group of travellers in Eritrea. One of their number, Darcy, an Australian journalist and lawyer, is attempting to prove that the Ethiopians are using international food aid relief as a cover for their gun-running.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nAfter its initial publication in Australia and the UK by Hodder and Stoughton in 1980, the novel was reprinted as follows:\n\nWarners Books, USA, 1989 (with alt title)\nLester and Orpen Dennys, Canada, 1989 (with alt title)\nSceptre, UK, 1990 and 2002\n\n\n== Dedication ==\n\"To my family who allowed me for a time to travel with the compassionate Eritrean Relief Association, and the brave Eritrean People's Liberation Front.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting in The Canberra Times reviewer Mark Thomas noted: \"Over the years Keneally has specialised in earnestly exhuming worthy subjects, ranging from Jimmie Blacksmith to Confederate soldiers to Joan of Arc to (most successfully) Schindler and his ark. With Towards Asmara, he has perfected the technique, in insisting that we (like him) make room for the Eritrean cause in our consciences...The novel is accordingly clogged with factual detail and cluttered with background information, all designed to make the Eritreans a bit more familiar and congenial to us...But, as with Schlinder's Ark, the reader may be left wondering precisely what he is being asked to read. The characters carry a heavy burden of philosophical and political baggage. The plot is thin and slow, focussed on a few foreigners' desultory traipsing around Eritrea in search of an errant father, a requited love, a rebel ambush and a little something to believe in.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGod or Politics : Tom Keneally in Eritrea (1990), a documentary made retracing Keneally's journey into Eritrea as research for this novel\n1989 in Australian literature\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ben Schrader (19 July 1964 - 19 April 2024) was a New Zealand historian specialising in urban history. His areas of interest included the history of state housing in New Zealand and urban development in New Zealand in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSchrader was born in Christchurch in 1964, and grew up in Wellington. He obtained a bachelor's degree in arts from Victoria University of Wellington followed by a master's degree in 1993. His master's thesis was titled Planning Happy Families: A History of the Naenae Idea, and it received the university's F.P. Wilson Prize. He has spoken publicly about the importance of Naenae to New Zealand's urban planning history. In 2001 he completed his doctorate at the University of Melbourne; his thesis was titled Rebuilding Melbourne: modernity and progress in the central business district, 1910–50.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSchrader was a contributor to the urban plates of the New Zealand Historical Atlas (1990–1997, edited by Malcolm McKinnon). He was the co-editor and co-author of the Economy and the City chapters of Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. \nHe was a founding member of the Professional Historians' Association of New Zealand (PHANZA) in 1994, served on its first committee, and in 2023 was made a life member of the organisation. Since 2015 he has served on the committee of Historic Places Wellington. In 2016 he was interviewed by Radio New Zealand about New Zealand's urban history.\nIn 2006 his book We Call It Home: a history of state housing in New Zealand (2005) was shortlisted for the history award at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. The Waikato Times described the book as a \"must-read book for all New Zealanders as it provides a valuable snapshot of an initiative we can be proud of\". In 2015 journalist Chris Trotter cited the work in a discussion about the politics of state housing, and in 2024 Max Rashbrooke referred to it as an \"excellent book\" that was relevant to the Government's announcement of a \"crackdown\" on emergency housing. \nIn 2017, Schrader's book The Big Smoke: New Zealand Cities, 1840–1920 (2016) received the W.H. Oliver Prize, awarded by the New Zealand Historical Association. The award recognises the best book published in New Zealand history on the previous two years. The work also received the 2017 New Zealand Heritage Non-Fiction Book Award, and was shortlisted for the General Non-Fiction award at the 2017 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. \nA review of The Big Smoke in the Journal of New Zealand Studies said the work \"makes a powerful case for the centrality of the urban in New Zealand’s evolving identity\". Erik Olssen writing in the New Zealand Journal of History noted some \"scholarly issues\" with the text but said these should not detract from the \"general reader's enjoyment\"; he said the work \"contained much fresh and original material, often enlivened by pertinent\nbiographical essays, [and] deftly introduced the broader socio-cultural context\".\nIn 2017 he received the CLNZ Writers' Award, worth $25,000, towards work on his next research project. Schrader held the 2022 JD Stout Fellowship at Victoria University of Wellington, during which his research work focused on the history of urban conservation in New Zealand.\nSchrader died on 19 April 2024, at the age of 59. His brother Paul announced his death via Instagram on 20 April. \n\n\n=== Selected works ===\nWe Call It Home: A History of State Housing in New Zealand (Reed Publishing, 2005)\nMore than a Landlord: A Short history of Wellington Housing Trust (Wellington Housing Trust, 2006)\nThe Big Smoke: New Zealand Cities, 1840–1920 (Bridget Williams Books, 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMore than a Landlord: A Short history of Wellington Housing Trust, publication for the Wellington Housing Trust, 2006",

        "content": "Counterexamples in Probability is a mathematics book by Jordan M. Stoyanov. Intended to serve as a supplemental text for classes on probability theory and related topics, it covers cases where a mathematical proposition might seem to be true but actually turns out to be false.\nFirst published in 1987, the book received a second edition in 1997 and a third in 2013.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRobert W. Hayden, reviewing the book for the Mathematical Association of America, found it unsuitable for reading cover-to-cover, while recommending it as a reference for \"graduate students and probabilists...the small audience whose needs match the title and level.\" Similarly, Geoffrey Grimmett called the book an \"excellent browse\" that, despite being a \"serious work of scholarship\" would not be suitable as a course textbook. R. W. Hammett wrote that it \"should become a classic supplement\" for those students who wish to go above and beyond their ordinary course requirements, and that \"it should also become essential to those who plan to work in the field.\" D. R. Grey gave it a positive evaluation as a reference text while noting that the counterexamples it includes range \"from those accessible to first-year undergraduates ... to those only comprehensible to specialists in stochastic processes\".\nRichard Durrett gave a more negative review, saying that \"Most readers will learn a few interesting things\" but regarding most of the counterexamples to be well-known or redundant. While Durrett appreciated the illustrations by A. T. Fomenko, the more positive review by F. W. Steutel did not, calling them a \"rather unhappy cross\" between Dalí and Escher.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nStoyanov, J. M. (1987). Counterexamples in Probability (1st ed.). Wiley.

It was established in response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, following the devastation observed in the kibbutzim and towns in the Gaza Envelope.\nThe goal of the body, is to rehabilitate the towns at the Gaza Envelope, that suffered great damage from the infiltration of Hamas.\nThe agency is responsible for 45 towns and kibbutzim in the regional councils of Eshkol, Hof Ashkelon, Sdot Negev and Sha'ar HaNegev. the agency also supports the city of Sderot, which suffered from Battle of Sderot.\nThe agency was established for five years (19th october 2023 - 2028) and its initial budget was one billion Israeli shekels (or: 263,963,330$). Its goal is to \"re-strengthen the national resilience and security of the residents of the region\".\nThe head of the agency is Brigadier General (Res.) Moshe Adri, who also serves as head of the Israel Atomic Energy Committee.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThere has been significant anger over the agency's inaction. people are complaining it is not doing enough and is politically corrupted.\nYossi Sheli, CEO of the Prime Minister's Office, delayed the establishment of the agency for two weeks, because of his opposition to the appointment of Udi Adiri, who was involved in the thirty-sixth government of Israel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sanjana Jatav (born 1 May 1998) is an Indian National Congress politician and a member of Alwar Zila Parishad. She is contesting as the Congress candidate at Bharatpur (SC) in the 2024 general election and is the youngest candidate in Rajasthan at the age of 25.\nShe is seen as a young rising star in the Congress party who has been campaigning to tackle issues of rampant crime in Mewat, inflation, unemployment, shortage of water, electricity, roads and farmers getting fair prices, fertilisers and seeds. Her candidature has gotten the backing of veteran leaders like Bhanwar Jitendra Singh and Vishvendra Singh. Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra has also campaigned in her support in the constituency. \nShe is also leading Congress's \"Ladki Hoon Lad Sakti Hoon\" in eastern Rajasthan with the aim of spreading the message of the importance of women's empowerment in the region. Sanjana had previously contested as the Congress candidate from Kathumar (SC) in 2023 Rajasthan election, losing by a razor thin margin of 409 votes.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nShe is a resident of Samunchi village in Kathumar tehsil, Alwar district and is married to Kaptan Singh, who is a constable with the Rajasthan Police.  They have two children. \nSanjana was born in 1998 to Harbhajan and Ramvati Devi. Her father Harbhajan is a thekedar (contractor) has been an upsarpanch. Her maiden home is in Bhusawar, Bharatpur district. She completed her BA from Gandhi Jyoti College of Maharaja Surajmal Brij University and her LLB from Lords University, Alwar.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSanjana's first electoral contest was in the Alwar Zila Parishad where she won from ward 29 by 4,991 votes. In the 2023 Rajasthan election, she was placed as the Congress candidate from Kathumar (SC) and lost by a slim margin of 409 votes. The candidacy had marked a change in tactics of the Congress party where they had pushed for a young female leader instead of relying on the traditional veteran former MLA of the constituency.\nShe has the backing of senior Congress leaders Bhanwar Jitendra Singh and Vishvendra Singh and is also associated with Priyanka Gandhi, leading the Congress's \"Ladki Hoon Lad Sakti Hoon\" campaign in eastern Rajasthan, to amplify messages of women's empowerment and gender equality among rural women.\n\n\n== References ==",

The area is located around two large artificial basins built starting from the early twentieth century for hydroelectric purposes, Lake Suviana, surrounded by a thick pine forest, and the Brasimone basin, with grassy banks.\nThe regional park entirely contains the Suviana and Brasimone Lakes site of community interest (IT40500020), which covers an area of 1902 hectares (4,700 acres) within the protected area.\n\n\n== Territory ==\nThe territory of the park is enclosed between the valleys of the Brasimone and Limentra Orientale streams, the main tributaries of the two lakes; however, the southern border of the park is on the right bank of the Pavana basin, in the Western Limentra valley.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe park is covered by a multiple and abundant forest: there are mainly artificially planted pine forests, as well as oak, ash, chestnut and spruce forests, where various species of deer, roe deer, wild boar and fallow deer are protected. In the old chestnut woods, thick enough to offer the possibility of nesting, there are avian species such as the great spotted woodpecker and the green woodpecker\n\n\n== Accommodation ==\nSala della Terra visitor center, dedicated to the geology of the park, in Castiglione dei Pepoli. Ultimo Bazzani's collection is exhibited there.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSuviana\nLake Suviana\nLake Brasimone\nLimentra Valley\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Black mariners, alternatively referred to as African American mariners, played crucial roles in maritime activities throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly within the Atlantic region. Emerging from communities such as Rhode Island and Martha's Vineyard, they held significant positions aboard seafaring and whaling vessels. The history of Black Mariners spans centuries and encompasses a rich tapestry of maritime exploration, trade, and cultural exchange.\n\n\n== Seafaring and whaling during the Middle Passage ==\nThe role of Black Mariners in the transatlantic slave trade, particularly during the Middle Passage, remains a topic of somber historical discussion. This period saw Black Mariners navigating through perilous conditions as they transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n==== Seafaring ====\nSeafaring emerged as one of the most lucrative entry-level occupations available to free blacks during this era, offering not only steady wages but also opportunities for international travel and cultural exchange. Many free blacks found employment aboard sailing vessels, where they could interact with Afro-descendent communities dispersed throughout the Americas, fostering a sense of transnational black identity. Seafaring played a significant role in the lives of both enslaved and free African heritage men during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Research suggests that African heritage seamen constituted a substantial percentage of crews aboard vessels departing from Newport, Rhode Island, for voyages to the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa.\n\n\n==== Whaling ====\nDuring the peak of the whaling industry's success in the 18th century, a notable but small group of black whaling captains emerged, spanning from Massachusetts to California. Despite the prevailing racial inequalities of the time, these individuals thrived in their roles during and after the Civil War, a period marked by widespread bondage and servitude among their peers.\nBy the mid-19th century, the whaling industry reached its peak, engaging an estimated 70,000 individuals. Whales were hunted primarily for their oil, which served various purposes such as lighting lamps and manufacturing wool, leather, and soap. A typical whaling voyage lasted two to three years, with crew members receiving a percentage of the total value of the oil and bone harvested, commensurate with their positions and experience.\nThe harsh conditions and high mortality rates inherent in whaling made it an unappealing occupation for many, yet African-Americans, often marginalized in other industries, readily embraced its dangers. Black seamen involved in whaling hailed from diverse backgrounds, including regions of the northeastern and southern United States, as well as the West Indies and the Cape Verde Islands off the African coast.\nDespite their varied origins, black mariners found acceptance in the whaling industry based on their reputation as diligent and skilled workers. Race did not serve as a barrier to their inclusion; rather, they were valued for their hard work and expertise in an industry characterized by its physical demands, filth, and limited financial rewards for most participants.\n\n\n==== Conditions ====\nAny close supervision of skilled maritime workers were often overlooked. Many of the slave boatmen, responsible for navigating locally constructed boats known as pettiaugers, operated within all-black crews with minimal oversight as they transported rice, indigo, and provisions between plantations and ports.\nEfficiency took priority when it came to transportation networks, leading to the constant movement of goods and people throughout the Atlantic World. This emphasis on efficiency undermined efforts to isolate enslaved individuals to their respective plantations, fostering regular interactions and exchanges of information between various locales.\nThe mobility afforded to enslaved maritime workers and plantation laborers facilitated avenues of communication that challenged the dehumanizing effects of the plantation complex. Despite the oppressive conditions, enslaved individuals maintained connections with family members and communities, preserving a sense of identity and agency beyond the confines of slavery. This network of communication served as a vital lifeline, enabling individuals to stay informed about regional developments and sustain meaningful relationships despite the constraints of their circumstances.\nAfrican mariners on slave vessels, particularly those voyaging from the African Coast to the Caribbean, served a practical purpose. Due to the high mortality rate among white crew members from diseases like Yellow Fever, the presence of African crew members, who had developed resistance to such illnesses, ensured the stability and profitability of the slave voyage. Additionally, African crew members provided invaluable linguistic and navigational expertise, further facilitating the operation of slave ships.\nEnslaved Africans, seeking freedom, often chose the sea as a pathway to liberation. Runaway advertisements from the time reveal a significant number of enslaved individuals fleeing their bondage in one coastal urban center to find refuge in others, such as New Bedford, Newport, Providence, and Martha’s Vineyard where they could join sailing crews. African heritage crew members served in various capacities on these vessels, starting from cooks and cabin boys and rising to able-bodied seamen. African heritage men also utilized their positions within the maritime industry to raise funds for the purchase of their enslaved family members.\nDespite the harsh challenges of the slave institution during the 18th and 19th centuries, both enslaved and free Africans demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. For many African heritage men in colonial Rhode Island, the maritime industry offered a pathway to freedom and prosperity.\n\n\n== Maritime communities and culture ==\nExploration of the development of maritime communities among Black Mariners, including the establishment of ports, trade networks, and cultural exchange.\nMartha's Vineyard, originally inhabited by the Wampanoag people, saw its colonial beginnings when Englishman Thomas Mayhew purchased the island in 1641. Initially settled by Europeans and Native Americans, Martha's Vineyard witnessed the arrival of enslaved West Africans in the 1600s, who worked on the farms of European settlers. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, farming, brickmaking, and fish smoking were the predominant industries before the emergence of a flourishing whaling and fishing enterprise, particularly centered in Edgartown. This period marked a significant economic boom for Martha's Vineyard, attributed to the success of the whaling industry.\nIn the 19th century, Martha's Vineyard gained prominence through its thriving whaling industry, with ships embarking on voyages around the world to hunt whales for their oil and blubber. It was during the Harlem Renaissance, Martha's Vineyard attracted prominent black writers seeking inspiration, further cementing its reputation as a cultural haven for African Americans. The Shearer Inn became a gathering place for renowned black artists and intellectuals, offering a space for open discussions on race, religion, and class.\nOak Bluffs, a community off the coast of Boston where wealthy individuals have their summer homes, became a significant hub for African American vacationers. In 1912, Charles Shearer, the son of a slave and her white owner, established the first inn for black vacationers in Oak Bluffs, providing a haven for African Americans who faced discrimination elsewhere on the island. This marked the beginning of Oak Bluffs' transformation into a second home for successful African Americans from across the country.\nHowever, despite Oak Bluffs' reputation as a haven for the black elite, Martha's Vineyard has a history of segregation and classism. Historically, blacks resided in Oak Bluffs, while whites settled in Edgartown. While racism was not openly displayed, discrimination existed behind closed doors, with instances of housing segregation and prejudice.\nIn recent years, Martha's Vineyard has earned the nickname \"The Black Hamptons,\" reflecting its popularity among wealthy African Americans as a vacation destination. It serves as a gathering place for members of esteemed black upper-class organizations, fostering connections and community among visitors from across the country. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"Vineyard Magic,\" highlights the island's enduring cultural significance within the African American community.\n\n\n== Notable Black mariners ==\n\n\n==== Profiles of influential Black mariners ====\nThis section explores the lives and legacies of notable Black Mariners who made significant contributions to navigation, trade, and exploration throughout history. From advocating for abolition to navigating the high seas, these individuals played pivotal roles in shaping maritime history and challenging societal norms. Join us as we delve into the stories of these remarkable figures and uncover their enduring impact on the maritime world.\nThroughout history, several individuals have emerged as prominent figures within the maritime community, showcasing resilience, determination, and activism. Such figures as, Absalom Boston, Olaudah Equiano, Crispus Attucks, and Paul Cuffee, each made significant contributions to the maritime world and beyond.\n\n\n==== Absalom Boston ====\nAbsalom Boston, a United States mariner, made significant contributions to both the maritime industry and the abolitionist movement. In 1822, he achieved a groundbreaking milestone by becoming the first African-American captain to command a whaleship with an all-black crew at 37 years old. Leading his crew on a six-month voyage, Boston returned triumphantly with 70 barrels of whale oil, showcasing his skill and leadership at sea.\nBeyond his maritime achievements, Boston played a crucial role in the Nantucket abolitionist movement. He was a founding trustee of the Nantucket’s African Baptist Society and the African Meeting House, institutions dedicated to advancing the rights and welfare of African Americans in the community.\nBoston's early years were spent working in the whaling industry, where he quickly rose through the ranks. By the age of 20, he had accumulated enough wealth to purchase property in Nantucket, demonstrating his entrepreneurial acumen and determination.\nLater in life, Boston obtained a license to operate a public inn, further establishing himself as a respected figure in the community. Upon retiring from his maritime voyages, he continued to serve as a leader within the island’s black community, opening a store and assuming the role of trustee at the African Baptist Church.\nIn 1845, Boston took a stand for racial equality by backing a campaign to integrate Nantucket’s public schools. His advocacy culminated in a successful lawsuit to have his daughter admitted to high school, marking a significant victory in the fight against segregation.\nAbsalom Boston's legacy as both a pioneering mariner and a dedicated community leader endures to this day. He passed away in 1855, leaving behind a lasting impact on Nantucket's maritime heritage and social justice movements.\n\n\n==== Olaudah Equiano ====\nOlaudah Equiano, a prominent figure in the abolitionist movement, chronicled his experiences as an enslaved sailor in the Atlantic World. Originating from Montserrat in the Caribbean, Equiano worked as a \"hired out\" slave, earning wages that were largely remitted to his master. Through diligent saving, he eventually secured his freedom. Equiano leveraged his literacy to publish a compelling narrative of his enslavement and subsequent liberation, advocating fervently for the abolition of the slave trade and slavery itself. His writings resonated widely, influencing public opinion and contributing to the abolitionist cause in England.\n\n\n==== Crispus Attucks ====\nCrispus Attucks, a free black dockworker and sailor residing in Boston, played a significant role in American history as a martyr of the Boston Massacre. During the confrontation between Boston residents and British soldiers, Attucks exhibited leadership and bravery, emerging as a central figure in the events that unfolded. His involvement was a confrontation that black sailors and laborers in colonial America had to experience, shedding light on issues of economic inequality and oppression.\n\n\n==== Paul Cuffee ====\nBorn to a free black father and Native American mother, Paul Cuffee defied societal barriers to become a prominent captain, merchant, and shipowner in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Starting his career as a sailor on whale ships, Cuffee's entrepreneurial spirit propelled him to own and operate multiple trading vessels. His influence extended beyond the maritime industry, as evidenced by his successful petition to President James Madison for an exemption from trade embargoes. Like Equiano, Cuffee shared a vision of establishing a community for free black individuals, contributing to efforts to relocate to Sierra Leone. Today, Cuffee's legacy is commemorated by institutions such as the Paul Cuffee Charter School in Providence, Rhode Island, which honors his achievements and promotes educational excellence.\n\n\n== Maritime laws ==\n\n\n==== Legislation against free Black sailors ====\nCommencing with South Carolina in 1822, southern states enacted stringent laws, known as Negro Seamen Acts, mandating the imprisonment of all free black sailors while their ships were docked in port. By the 1840s, Charleston, Savannah, and Mobile each detained over two hundred free black sailors annually, according to contemporary estimates. Louisiana pursued a distinct strategy, arresting free black sailors under the guise of being fugitive slaves and incarcerating them in slave prisons until their captains paid substantial jail fees and removed them from the state. Sailors whose captains failed to retrieve them faced prolonged detention.\nFree black sailors posed a significant concern for public authorities in slave societies, who feared their potential to disseminate revolutionary ideas, incite slave rebellions, and harbor fugitive slaves seeking freedom. The New Orleans Commercial Bulletin proclaimed in 1841 that black sailors were \"the worst evil that threatens the peace of the South,\" portraying them as a perilous threat to societal institutions, dedicated to fomenting insurrection and violence.\n\n\n==== African-American organizational triumphs ====\nAs early as 1780, free Africans in Newport established the Free African Union Society with the aim of promoting, preserving, and safeguarding African rights in Newport and America. This self-help African organizational model later expanded to cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Providence, Rhode Island. On October 6, 1791, the Newport group drafted and dispatched a letter to other African organizations, expressing their stance that Africans involved in the slave trade would not be accepted as members of their societies. While existing records from Newport do not document instances of Africans being denied or expelled from membership due to involvement in the slave trade, the drafting and public dissemination of the formal notice shed light on the genuine concerns and complexities of human relations during the early formation of America and its shared, albeit often tragic, history.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHorne, Gerald. “Red Seas.” Google Books, Google, 20 June 2005, books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EzihBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=%22Black%2Bsailors%22&ots=xauC2bwlCP&sig=5x2y-BV1sle-xMS0ggryz0uDpDE#v=onepage&q=%22Black%20sailors%22&f=false.\nFinley, Skip.

        "content": "The Golden State WNBA team is an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The team is scheduled to begin play in 2025 as a member of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), which started in 1997, previously had a team in the market in the Sacramento Monarchs, which played from 1997 until folding in 2009 and won a league championship. After the Monarchs ended, the WNBA remained steady with 12 teams, although there was often talk of expanding the league.\nOn September 26, 2023, it was reported by The Athletic that the owners of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, were finalizing an agreement to start a WNBA expansion team in San Francisco. Lacob had previously helped found the American Basketball League (ABL), which played before the WNBA, and owned one of their teams, the San Jose Lasers. The ABL folded in 1998 and the Lasers were the last San Francisco Bay Area women's basketball team.\nOn October 5, 2023, the expansion team was officially announced, with plans to begin play in 2025, being the first expansion team in the WNBA since the Atlanta Dream in 2008. The expansion fee for the franchise was reported to be $50 million over 10 years. It was reported that the team name's would include \"Golden State\", with announcement of the name, logos, and uniforms to come at a later date. Lacob and Guber became the team's owners, and it was announced that the team would play its home games at the Chase Center in San Francisco, while being headquartered in Oakland.\nWithin the first few hours of being announced, over 2,000 season ticket deposits were placed. On January 30, 2024, Jess Smith, an executive with Angel City FC, was hired as the team's president. On April 16, the team surpassed 6,000 season ticket deposits. An expansion draft is scheduled to be held in December 2024, and Golden State will participate in its first WNBA draft in 2025.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has been serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comic Newtype from December 2021 to June 2023. It was licensed for an English-language release by Yen Press.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nEmille, a young vampire, is assigned a \"Big Sister\" on her fourteenth birthday to teach her survival skills. The relationship between Emille and her sister is cultivated through learning how to hunt and feed on humans. However, Emille wonders if her relationship can evolve into something more.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nWritten and illustrated by Aya Haruhana, Kiss the Scars of the Girls was serializated on Kadokawa Shoten's Comic Newtype manga website from December 21, 2021, to June 13, 2023. The series was collected in three tankōbon volumes. The series is licensed for an English release in North America by Yen Press.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe series has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network gave the first volume of Kiss the Scars of the Girls an overall B+ rating, summarizing that is was an unlikely combination of genres that worked well; \"with its combination of a dark story and yearning romance, this is an exciting treat for Class S yuri fans and one worth checking out for all yuri readers.\" Adam Symchuk of asianmoviepulse.com wrote of the series \"the work here seems aimed at a very particular niche of fandom. Still, those who love a mix of kawaii, goth, and cutesy romance will be perfectly pleased with the approach Aya Haruhana takes\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial manga website at Comic Newtype (in Japanese)\nKiss the Scars of the Girls (manga) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia",

The holiday can also be observed by non-experts gathering to eat burritos with hydroecologists or ecohydrologists.\nHydroecology Burrito Day originated as a small gathering while Sam Zipper was completing his doctoral degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nThe first national celebration of Hydroecology Burrito Day (NHBD) on record occurred in 2021 and has since been celebrated formally by research groups at universities and informally among individual hydrologists in states including Alabama , Florida , Virginia , and New York . The holiday is officially recognized as an unofficial holiday by the American Geophysical Union's Hydrology Subsection Student Subcommittee .\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nelia Anne Carlton Davies (born 1943) is a retired American physicist who oversaw US-based research on fusion power as head of the US Fusion Energy Sciences program from 1989 to 2006.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nDavies was born on February 15, 1943, in Springfield, Missouri. She grew up in Arkansas, and graduated from Little Rock Central High School in 1961. She majored in physics at Vassar College, and completed a Ph.D. in 1972 at Yale University, with a dissertation in plasma physics, supervised by Jay L. Hirshfield.\nAfter two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, she joined the Tokamak Systems Branch of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1974, and became branch chief in 1975. Through the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, this part of the Atomic Energy Commission was split into the newly formed Energy Research and Development Administration in 1975, and then merged into the United States Department of Energy when it was created in 1977.\nIn 1980, she became a divisional director, of the Toroidal Confinement Systems Division in the Office of Fusion Energy. She was named as deputy director of the US Fusion Energy Sciences program in 1985, and director in 1989. Her tenure saw the program through turbulent times, as the US Congress cut its budget from $345 million to $284 million in 1991, raised it to $350 million again by 1995, and cut it to $239 million the following year. She retired in 2006.\nIn her retirement, she moved to a farm in Boyds, Maryland, took up horseback fox hunting, and joined the board of directors of Fusion Power Associates, a private foundation for fusion power research.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nDavies received the Meritorious Service Award of the Department of Energy in 1984, the Meritorious Presidential Rank Award in 1991, and the Secretary of Energy Gold Medal in 1997, and the Meritorious Presidential Executive Rank Award in 1999.\nIn 2003, she was named as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), after a nomination from the APS Forum on Physics and Society, \"for her successful efforts guiding the fusion research community through a difficult transition from a program of energy technology development to a healthy program focused on the critical scientific and technology foundations of fusion energy research\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Alice Hearrell Murray was an American and Chickasaw woman who served as the First Lady of Oklahoma between 1931 and 1935. She was married to Governor William H. Murray and the mother of Johnston Murray.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Alice Hearrell was born on January 9, 1875, near present-day Milburn, Oklahoma. Her father, Jecomiah B. Harrell was a blacksmith and veteran of the Confederate Army. After the American Civil War he changed his last name to Hearrell and married his third wife, and Mary Alice's mother, Martha America Walker. Walker was Chickasaw, and their marriage allowed Jecomiah, who was white, to live in the Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory.\nWhen Hearell was eight, her father grew ill and she was sent to live with her uncle, Douglas H. Johnston, who at the time was the superintendent of Bloomfield Seminary, a female boarding school. At school, she grew very close to her uncle Johnston and her education focused on both her \"Indian heritage\" and \"navigat[ing] the demands of the white world.\" Graduates of Bloomfield in the Chickasaw Nation were referred to as \"Bloomfield Blossoms\" and were among the most respected women of the Chickasaw elite. Hearell graduated from Bloomfield in 1894. \n\n\n== Marriage, First Lady of Oklahoma, and death ==\nOn September 1, 1894, Hearell began teaching at the Mead School in Mead, Oklahoma. She returned to live with her uncle Douglas H. Johnston by 1897 when her mom became ill and she started teaching at Bloomfield. Around this time, she met William H. Murray and the couple were married on July 19, 1899. She later served as the First Lady of Oklahoma between 1931 and 1935. She died on August 28, 1938, at St. Anthony's Hospital in Oklahoma City. Her body lay in state at the Oklahoma Capitol the next day, the first woman to receive the honor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nMoore, Jesse E.

        "content": "The Trinity UFO case, according to the reports of the witnesses, happened in August 1945, nearly five weeks after the  first atomic bomb was detonated in Trinity desert's Jornada del Muerto,  New Mexico.  Two young boys, Jose Padilla and Remigio Baca, were working at Rancho Padilla in San Diego. Antonito, near  San Antonio , New Mexico, when they saw a bright light, accompanied by a crashing sound.   According to their reports, they found a crashed manned device nearby, \"in the shape of an avocado\", with a protrusion at one end, which was later removed by the US army.\n\n\n== The context ==\nAbout 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Trinity there  was the Padilla family's ranch house, a traditional adobe house with a well in the front yard and a  pickup  truck that their nine-year-old son, José Padilla, drove,  since at the time the men in the family served in the armed forces. \nJosé's father, Faustino Padilla, worked for the WPA (Work Projects Administration of the Civilian Conservation Corps).   The family raised cattle on a large ranch leased to the  Bureau of Land Management,  and much of the daily work on the property was handled by José, often helped by his friend Remigio Baca, two years younger than him. \nRemigio Baca's family lived in conditions very similar to those of José Padilla. Remigio's father, who had once been a tenant farmer, was an assistant at the Veterans Hospital in Albuquerque. The Baca family was descendant of the original Spaniards who established the government of  New Spain. As for José Padilla, he was of  Apache  descent on his maternal side; on his father's side he was of a recent Spanish origin.\nWhen the first atomic bomb exploded, the two families, like many other inhabitants of the area, were taken by surprise by the  flash, the tremendous sound and the heat wave: Inez Padilla, José's mother,  lost sight in one of her eyes. Other serious consequences for the residents of the area would follow over the years, with  the contempt and negligence of several governments of the United States of America. \n\n\n== The events ==\n\n\n==== First day ====\nAccording to the testimonies of the  involved, during the day of August 16, 1945, Jose Padilla, then nine years old, and Remigio Baca, seven years old, were searching on horseback for a lost cow, which was about to give birth, when they heard a loud bang and a ground shook.  Looking around, they saw smoke nearby and headed there.\nThere was a huge groove in the ground, about 30 cm deep and 30 meters wide.  The ground was hot and nearby bushes had caught fire. At the end of the groove was an object, \"avocado-shaped\", with a hole on one side.  There were several metallic debris on the ground.  The boys watched the device through binoculars: small creatures moved back and forth.  A sharp sound was heard, which Remigio compared to that of an animal in pain, or the first cries of a newborn baby.\nThe size of the object was calculated by Jose Padilla to be seven and a half to nine meters long, and about four meters high. It was gray, metallic in appearance, and had probably collided with a nearby radio tower about 15 meters high. The creatures, three in number, would be about one and a half meters tall, had huge eyes and very thin and long arms.  Their appearance was described as similar to a praying mantis, or a Jerusalem cricket, with pear-shaped heads.  The nose and mouth were just small holes.  Despite the description, Jose considered them human and said he felt their fright and suffering.\nThe boys were tempted to get closer to the place, but in the meantime it was getting dark and they had to return to their homes, where they told their parents what had happened.\n\n\n==== Third day ====\nThe day after the sighting, neither of the two boys could approach the place, as they had tasks to complete.  Only on the 18th, a Saturday, did they go to there, accompanying the father of one of them, Faustino Padilla, and Eddie Apodaca, a state police officer and family friend. \nOnce there, the two adults entered the object.  After five or ten minutes inside, they came out disturbed, without talking about what they had seen;  whatever it was, the situation seemed to have worsened.  Addressing the two boys, they said: \"Don’t tell anybody about this, not your brother, not your cousin, not your mother, not your father, that’s our business. (...) And the reason for this is, that you can get in trouble\".  The strange creatures seemed to have disappeared.\nOn the same day, the two boys escaped, returning to the crash site alone.  Some soldiers were already there, collecting debris from the ground.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGood, Timothy (2006) – Need to know : UFOs, the Military and Intelligence - Pan Books\nVallée, Jacques ( & Harris, Paola L,) (2021) – Trinity: The Best-Kept Secret -Starworks USA, LLC and Documatica Research, LLC",

Dedicated to the memory of fellow drummer Stu Martin, it was recorded on February 18, 1979, at Sound Ideas Studios in New York City, and was released in 1981 by Soul Note.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow described the album as \"well-rounded\" and \"a continually interesting set.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings called the album \"an engagingly varied session, probably the best introduction to Altschul’s work,\" and wrote: \"The title-track is a long, multi-dimensional exploration of rhythmic and tonal ideas, contrasting with Davis's typically thoughtful and oddly engaging 'Sleepwalker'. Altschul takes a solo spot on 'Drum Role', more interesting than these things usually are, but the highlight is a rousing interpretation of Mingus's 'Orange Was The Colour Of Her Dress, Then Silk Blues'.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"For Stu\" (Barry Altschul) – 11:08\n\"Sleepwalker\" (Anthony Davis) – 9:07\n\"Drum Role\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:52\n\"Orange Was the Color of Her Dress, Then Silk Blues\" (Charles Mingus) – 13:33\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums\nRay Anderson – trombone\nAnthony Davis – piano\nRick Rozie – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Euro (a classical name for the sirocco) was an Italian Lampo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1901, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1921 and then used as a target ship, she was renamed Strale in September 1924 and stricken in November 1924.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nEuro was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire on 9 January 1900. She was launched on 27 August 1900 and completed on 11 October 1901. She was commissioned in October 1901.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nEuro played an active role in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Euro and the destroyers Dardo, Lampo, Ostro, and Strale made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) F. Gambardella. Euro and her sister ship Strale were based at Tobruk in Italian Cyrenaica. By 1915, the Lampo-class destroyers were of antiquated design and had only limited military usefulness, but during World War I, they were modified, having equipment installed to carry and lay 12 mines, drop depth charges, and tow explosive paravanes.\nOn 9 December 1915 Euro and the destroyer Indomito escorted the auxiliary ship Sterope from Taranto, Italy, to Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania.\nThe presence of Euro and Ostro in the harbor ay Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) on the coast of Albania in late December 1916 prompted the Austro-Hungarian Navy to raid the harbor on 29 December 1916 in an attempt to attack them. The two destroyers had left by the time the Austro-Hungarian raid took place and thus escaped damage, although the Austro-Hungarians sank the only ships that were present in the harbor, the Greek steamship Mikael and two sailing ships.\nEuro was involved in a friendly fire incident on 11 March 1917 when she and the torpedo boat Airone sighted the Italian submarines F9 and F10 while steaming off Messina, Sicily. Mistaking F9 and F10 for Central Powers submarines, Euro and Airone opened fire on them, forcing them to dive. Both submarines escaped unscathed.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nIn July 1921, Euro was reclassified as a torpedo boat. She was employed as a target ship from 1921 to 1923. Renamed Strale in September 1924, she was stricken from the naval register on 13 November 1924 and subsquently discarded and scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Frances Culbreth Van Gasken (May 24, 1860 – October 24, 1939) was an American physician and suffragist, based in Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nVan Gasken was born in Smyrna, Delaware, the daughter of John Van Gasken and Harriet Van Gasken. Her mother died in 1863, and she was raised by her stepmother, Rachel English Van Gasken. She graduated from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1890. She later made postgraduate studies in Vienna. Her brother Joseph practiced medicine in Texas.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVan Gasken was one of the first women interns at Philadelphia General Hospital. In 1893 she was an inspector for the city's Bureau of Health, and addressed the Civic Club of Philadelphia on health conditions in the city's tenement houses. She was resident physician at the College Settlement House in Philadelphia until 1896, when she became physician for the women's department of the Philadelphia Municipal Court. She was removed as medical inspector by the mayor in 1899, sparking a protest from her colleagues. She was a professor of clinical medicine at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1918 until she resigned as part of a faculty protest over Alice Weld Tallant's dismissal in 1923.Van Gasken was known to wear a \"Votes for Women\" pin while teaching, and in January 1915 she was part of a delegation of Pennsylvania suffragists who spoke on the subject at the White House with Woodrow Wilson. She exhorted women medical students in 1917 to take on professional responsibilities and join in the war effort, saying \"Who is there to fill these places but women? Is it not your day? Does opportunity not call to you?\"\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nVan Gasken died in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, in 1939, at the age of 79. She left money to her sister and Camp Onawa in Piscataquis County, Maine, to her nephew; her estate also funded a scholarship in her father's name, at a high school in her hometown.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sounds of Crenshaw Vol. 1 is the first studio album by American musical supergroup The Pollyseeds. It was released on July 14, 2017, through Sounds Of Crenshaw/Ropeadope Records. Recording sessions took place at Organic Grease Studios and Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Production was handled by Terrace Martin and Robert Glasper, with co-producer Marlon Williams.\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 3 on the Jazz Albums and topped the Contemporary Jazz Albums charts. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 23 on the Official Hip Hop and R&B Albums Chart and number 48 on the Official Independent Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nSounds of Crenshaw Vol. 1 was met with universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81 based on nine reviews.\nKevin Press of Exclaim! praised the album, saying that it is a \"deeply funky jazz record with a sensibility that incorporates the best of this L.A. neighbourhood's long fascination with hip-hop and R&B. It captures the full breadth of the region's rich musical history. ... This is, at the very least, the record of the summer. For some, it might just be the record of 2017\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman stated: \"the freewheeling, uplifted spirit likewise continues. Martin and company combine and alternate between groove-oriented contemporary jazz, soul, funk, and hip-hop\". Ammar Kalia of Clash resumed: \"although the second half of the record loses steam somewhat with a succession of slow R&B vocal numbers like \"Your Space\" and \"Feelings of the World\", Sounds of Crenshaw Vol. 1 largely maintains its coherence. Its slight messiness is representative of a life lived, something that in itself never coheres as a perfect narrative\". Ural Garrett of HipHopDX found it \"feels like the ideal soundtrack to the iconic 23-mile street named after the real estate banker George Lafayette Crenshaw. It won't transcend to other hoods but Martin and crew win by developing a project that's sonically ambitious from beginning to end\". Charles Waring of Record Collector wrote: \"while the relaxed vibe is continuous, the music isn't repetitive but there's nothing really new here: rather it's an extension of what Sade's band Sweetback and trumpeter Roy Hargrove's RH Factor were doing well over a decade ago. Even so, it's an enthralling fusion of sounds and styles\". Seth Colter Walls of Pitchfork concluded: \"over time, the album's subtle ambition becomes impossible to miss\".\nIn his mixed review for The Guardian, John Lewis wrote: \"[Terrace Martin's] latest project uses some heavyweight jazz talents but takes us into more mainstream R&B territory, with decent neosoul numbers including \"Intentions\" (featuring Chachi) and \"You and Me\" (featuring Rose Gold) mixed with rather bland and soporific fuzak\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTerrace Martin – synthesizer (tracks: 1-8, 10-12), alto saxophone (tracks: 2, 3, 7, 12), vocoder (tracks: 3-5, 8, 10-13), drum machine (tracks: 3, 12), percussion (track 7), soprano saxophone (track 9), producer, mixing, executive producer\nMarlon Williams – guitar (tracks: 1-4, 6, 8, 10-13), co-producer (tracks: 2, 3, 5, 7-12), executive A&R\nRobert Glasper – piano & producer (tracks: 2, 4)\nRobert \"Sput\" Searight – drums (tracks: 2, 4), percussion (track 2)\nKamasi Washington – tenor saxophone (tracks: 2, 7)\nJason \"Chachi\" Martin – vocals (tracks: 3, 11)\nWyann Vaughn – backing vocals (tracks: 3, 4, 7, 12), vocals (track 10)\nRose Gold – backing vocals (tracks: 3, 12), vocals (tracks: 6, 11)\nCraig Brockman – piano (tracks: 3, 6, 12, 13)\nPreston Harris – backing vocals (track 6), vocals (track 13)\nChris Cadenhead – piano (track 7)\nBrandon \"Eugene\" Owens – bass (track 7)\nErnest \"Curly\" Martin – drums (track 7)\nAdam Turchin – baritone saxophone (track 8), creative assistant\nTrevor Lawrence Jr. – drum programming (tracks: 8, 11), drums (track 13)\nKenneth Crouch – piano (track 9)\nAndrew Gouche – bass (track 13)\nRick Carson – mixing (track 11), mastering\nLouis Marks – executive producer\nSamantha J – artwork, photography\nMonesia Hobbs – executive A&R\nJayne Andrew – executive A&R\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSounds Of Crenshaw Vol. 1 at Discogs (list of releases)",

        "content": "Lucian Louis Watts (1888–1974) was a leader in efforts to improve the social welfare of blind Virginians. Born sighted and blinded in adulthood, Watts was involved in the founding of state and national organizations for the blind, including the Virginia Association of Workers for the Blind (now Virginia Industries for the Blind), the Virginia Commission for the Blind (now the Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired), and the American Foundation for the Blind. Watts advocated for programs to prevent blindness, and, in a time when education for the blind in Virginia was limited to children, Watts expanded that training to adults. \n\n\n== Early life and injury ==\nLucian Louis Watts was born in 1888 to parents Lucian Clark Watts and Jenny Barksdale (Burnley) Watts on the Riverhill estate in Stony Point in Albemarle County, Virginia.  L.L.Watts' father, Lucian Clark Watts, was elected sheriff of Albemarle County, serving from 1895 to 1911. Watts was educated in public schools and enjoyed playing sports and working with his father as a deputy sheriff. He spent one year at Fork Union Military Academy before beginning a career as a railroad construction superintendent.\nIn May of 1913, Watts lost his sight in a dynamite explosion while working in Dickenson County. He suffered a harrowing journey from the rural construction site to the University of Virginia Hospital, where he spent months in recovery before returning to his parents' home .\nIn 1913 there was very little in the way of state services to help Watts. The only state institutions at the time were the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind (VSDB) at Staunton, which admitted white school-aged children, and the Virginia State School for Colored Deaf and Blind Children at Newport News. Despite the fact that Watts was well over the age limit for admission to VSDB, he managed to secure a place at the school. During his time there, Watts became passionate in his conviction that Virginia needed to do more to provide for the blind. He felt strongly that there was no fault in the condition of blindness, but that the hardship for the blind was due to the lack of access to education and means to participate in society.\n\n\n== Public service ==\nAfter his graduation from VSDB, Watts began a career in public service. He quickly began to devote his energies to improving the lot of blind Virginians. He saw a need for services for the blind in Virginia, recognizing that many of them had become blind later in life and did not have access to training that would help them find new forms of employment. In 1919, he founded the Virginia Association of Workers for the Blind (now, Virginia Industries for the Blind) with the VSDB’s president H.M. McManaway and others.\nThrough the Virginia Association of Workers for the Blind, and in collaboration with state congressman Herbert J. Taylor, who sponsored the bill, Watts lobbied the Virginia legislature to form a temporary commission to study the number of blind people in Virginia and assess their needs. Watts and Taylor were both appointed to the Legislative Commission for the Blind, which presented its census and report in 1921. The Virginia Commission for the Blind became permanent in 1922, and Watts served as its executive secretary for the next 34 years until his retirement at the age of 68. \nThe Virginia Commission for the Blind building, designed by the prominent Virginia architect J. Binford Walford, was dedicated in 1941. The Commission was renamed several times and is now called the Virginia Department for the Blind and Visually Impaired.\nIn addition to his work with the Virginia Association of Workers for the Blind and the Virginia Commission for the Blind, in 1926, Watts successfully campaigned to represent Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Delegates. He held office for 4 terms, from 1926 to 1933, using his position in the legislature to better advance his causes for the blind. In 1930, Watts helped to pass a bill that ensured sight-saving classes were established in any Virginia county where there were six or more students with impaired vision.\nWatts' endeavors were not limited to Virginia. From 1934 to 1937 he served as president of the American Foundation for the Blind whose mission included gathering information about vision loss and advocating for the needs of blind people to the federal government.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1929 L.L. Watts married Hazel Birkenmeyer, the first teacher of sight-saving classes for the Virginia Commission for the Blind. Their daughter, Hazel Elizabeth Watts was born in 1930. \n\n\n== Awards ==\nWatts' many contributions and years of dedicated service were recognized and celebrated. In 1953, he received the Ambrose M. Shotwell Award from the Association of Workers for the Blind in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the rehabilitation of adults who are blind or visually impaired. In 1957, Watts was awarded the R.B. Irwin Award from the National Industries for the Blind for championing the employment of people who are blind.  In 1962, he was awarded the Migel Medal Award from the American Foundation for the Blind, an award honoring those whose dedication and achievements have significantly improved the lives of people with vision loss. \n\n\n== Death ==\nLucian Louis Watts died at his home on April 30, 1974, and was buried at Riverview Cemetery, Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLucian Louis Watts papers.

        "content": "The Defense of Rorke's Drift is a board wargame published by World Wide Wargames (3W) in 1991 that simulates the Battle of Rorke's Drift, when forces of the Zulu Kingdom besieged a small outpost of British soldiers during the Anglo-Zulu War. A second game, The Boer War, was included in the box.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSeeking to create a large British colony in South Africa that would encompass the hitherto independent Zulu Kingdom as well as the independent Boer states of the Republic of South Africa, British High Commissioner to South Africa Bartle Frere sent a provocative ultimatum to Zulu king Cetshwayo. When this was rejected, Frere sent a British task force to invade the Zulu Kingdom. The Zulu, although outgunned, showed discipline and defeated the British force at the Battle of Isandlwana. A Zulu force of 4000 then attacked 120 British soldiers at a mission station called Rorke's Drift.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Defense of Rorke's Drift is a board wargame for two players in which one player controls the Zulu attackers and the other controls the British defenders.The game components include 400 die-cut counters, and a map of the outpost showing a small hospital occupied by about 20 patients and medical staff, a store house, and the hastily-erected perimeter fortifications linking the two buildings.\n\n\n=== Gameplay ===\nEach turn involves 6 phases:\nBritish movement\nZulu movement and reinforcements\nBritish rifle attacks\nZulu rifle and spear attacks\nZulu melee attacks\nBritish melee attacksThere are not enough Zulu counters to represent the entire Zulu force, so discarded Zulu counters are reintroduced to the game through reinforcements. \n\n\n=== Scenarios ===\nThe game provides five scenarios:\nA short solitaire scenario involving a British evacuation of the hospital.\nThe same scenario but designed for two players.\nThe full historical battle\nThe British try to evacuate the outpost and are caught in the open with no fortifications\nThe British player designs a new perimeter fortification.\n\n\n=== The Boer War ===\nThe box also includes the rules for a second game, The Boer War, using separate components: a map of South Africa and 200 die-cut counters. The game is a strategic-level simulation of the Second Boer War\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Defense of Rorke's Drift was designed by Peter Bertram, Eric Faust, and Lew Fisher, and was published as a boxed set by 3W in 1991. The box cover features a reproduction of the painting The Defense of Rorke's Drift by the 19th-century artist Alphonse de Neuville.\nThe second game included in the box, The Boer War, was designed by Eric Faust and Lew Fisher.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Issue 79 of Fire & Movement, James C. Gordon wrote a lengthy review and concluded, \"The Defense of Rorke's Drift offers value for the money. RD succeeds because of the solid research and an appropriately detailed system. As a game system and a tactical problem to be solved, this design challenges both sides.\" However, Gordon warned, \"The full campaign is a lengthy undertaking and requires stamina from both players.\"Writing for Simulacrum, Luc Olivier called this \"an interesting game to play ... very tactical and exotic. Everything from the rules to the map and the counters conspire to provide a feeling of the event: a farm filled with British and Colonials, some wounded, attacked by hordes of Zulus during a terrible night.\" Olivier noted \"the rules are quite long but logical and with a lot of details like roof burning, moving the wounded, British ranked fire, all lengthily explained with a lot of examples.\" Despite the lengthy rules, Olivier thought that \"the game plays smoothly in spite of the number of counters and the many steps of the sequence of play.\" Olivier liked the game but noted the lack of different scenarios, concluding, \"With the time required to play and the repetitive situation, the replay value is quite limited but the experience of play is great.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary E. Green (1841–1910) was an American physician, the first woman admitted to membership in the New York Medical Association. Green served as President of the American Household Economic Association.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Elizabeth Green was born in Machias, New York, August 6, 1844. Both her parents, Allen Green (b. 1810) and Emeline (Wicks) Green (b. 1816), were of New England ancestry. They moved to Michigan, when she was very young, and with limited means, they were obliged to endure all the hardships of pioneer life. As there were no brothers in the family, Mary worked both indoors and outdoors, preferring the latter, until, the house being built and a few acres about it cleared, she was allowed to think about education.\nShe went to a neighbor's, several miles distant, where she worked for her board and began to attend school. At the age of 14, she passed the required examination and began to teach, her salary being US$2 a week, with the privilege of boarding round. She was soon able to enter Olivet College. There she earned her own way, chiefly by doing housework, and partially so in Oberlin College, which she attended later.\nWhile yet in her teens, she realized the necessity of choosing some life work for herself, and as she desired to pursue the study of medicine, she quietly determined to do so. Undaunted by the criticism of her friends, in 1865, after one year's study with a physician, Green entered the New York Medical College. She was soon chosen assistant in the chemical laboratory, and besides that work, every evening found her, knife in hand, making the dissections to be used on the following day by the demonstrator of anatomy. She entered Bellevue Hospital and remained there, in spite of sexual harassment. On account of its hospital advantages, the next year she entered the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and for two years was an intern of the hospital. In 1868, she was graduated from that college with honor, her thesis being entitled \"Medical jurisprudence.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1866, while still in medical school, she married her cousin, Alonzo Green, then a practicing lawyer in New York City, where she went in 1868 and engaged in active practice.\nOutside of office hours, Green's time was occupied with charitable work, as she was visiting physician to the Midnight Mission, the Five Points Mission, Dr. Blackwell's Infirmary, and the Prison Home for Women. By personal effort, she organized and built up a large dispensary for women and children in a neglected quarter of the city, which was so successful that, after the first year in which over 2,000 patients were cared for, it received State and city support. Green's consulting physicians and surgeons were the most eminent in the city. \nIn 1870, she delivered part of a course of lectures on medical subjects in connection with Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, Dr. Willard Parker, and others. The year after her graduation, Green's name was presented for membership to the New York Medical Society, and after a stormy discussion she was admitted, being the first woman in the U.S. to win that opportunity for broader work. Soon after, she became a member of the New York Medico-Legal Society.\nWishing to pursue a higher course in the study of chemistry, she applied for admission to Columbia College, but her request was not granted. She entered upon a course of evening lectures given by Professor Charles F. Chandler in the College of Pharmacy, and, although she could not graduate, as she was a woman, the knowledge was gained. During those years of constant mental and physical work, Green became the mother of two children.\nWhile in New York, she attended the Cooper Institute lectures regularly, and was otherwise interested in both literary and art work. In Cincinnati, she took up wood-carving.\nShe removed in 1873 to Charlotte, Michigan, where three more children were born. Green was twice elected health officer of Charlotte, Michigan. She was elected three times as a delegate to the American Medical Association by the State Medical Society.\n\nAt the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), Green served as Judge of Food Products. In 1894-95, she served as President of the Women's Club of Charlotte, Michigan.\nIn 1897, Green served as the third President of the American Household Economic Association, which had been founded in 1893. By this time, the organization had become generally recognized through the efforts of State vice-presidents who in turn presented the subject and supplied literature to the clubs and educational institutions of their representative states. During Green's presidency, Household Economics was given a place on the program of the conventions of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and also at many of the meetings of the State Federations. Green was called upon to speak at these meetings as also were many other workers in the field. The subject met with an enthusiastic reception at the Denver Biennial of the General Federation, and the women throughout the West were ready to enlist in this enterprise.\nShe had charge of the diet kitchens established by the Red Cross for sick soldiers in the south during the Spanish–American War (1898).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1902, she gained international notoriety in a lawsuit to recover her two grandsons from the Theosophist colony at Point Loma, California. The court held with Green and the boys were brought to their father, John J. Bohn, proprietor of the Hotel World, Chicago. In 1905, Green relocated from Charlotte, Michigan to Tulsa, Oklahoma, later going to Seattle, Washington.  \nMary E. Green died in Seattle, February 9, 1910.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"The New Era in Food Supplies\", Modern Housekeeping, 1895\n\"Milk, Butter and Cheese From the Standpoint of Health and Economy\", Annual Report of the Michigan Dairymen's Association, Volume 13, 1897\n\"Household Economics\", The Chautauquan, Volume 26, 1898\n\"Housekeeping in the Army.

        "content": "Meigan Charlotte Aronson is an American–Canadian physicist, professor and Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia. Her research looks to identify emerging phases (e.g. novel order) near a quantum phase transition. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAronson studied physics at Bryn Mawr College. She moved to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her doctoral research considered the electronic properties of niobium triselenide. She was a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she worked in condensed matter. She held a visiting position at the University of Amsterdam. \n\n\n== Research and career ==\nAronson started her physics career at the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor of Physics. She was made Professor in 2002, and Associate Dean in 2004. Aronson moved to Stony Brook University in 2007, where she was made Professor. Alongside her position at Stony Brook Aronson led the correlated electron materials section at Brookhaven National Laboratory. She joined Texas A&M University in 2015, where she spent three years before moving to the University of British Columbia.\nAronson studies the emerging physics of materials close to a quantum phase transition. She investigates how new physics emerges close to zero temperature. \nIn 2018 Aronson became Dean of the Faculty of Science at University of British Columbia. She is Chair of the External Advisory Committee of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the American Physical Society Division of Condensed Matter Physics.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2001 Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society\n2010 Department of Defense Security Fellow\n2018 Elected Fellow of the Neutron Scattering Society of America\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nXiaowei Teng; Mikhail Feygenson; Qi Wang; Jiaqing He; Wenxin Du; Anatoly I Frenkel; Weiqiang Han; Meigan Aronson (1 September 2009). \"Electronic and magnetic properties of ultrathin Au/Pt nanowires\".

        "content": "Lewis Gill is an English composer and musician, who has worked in the contemporary classical, electronica, art rock and experimental music areas.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years (art-rock and experimental music) ===\nBorn in Warrington in 1968 (and a long-term resident of the town’s Latchford neighbourhood), Gill initially worked as an electric guitarist in a succession of Warrington-based projects, many of these alongside fellow guitarist and experimenter Ian Simpson. Gill and Simpson initially played together in the art-rock band Cheeky Atom (who released a single mini-album called Jodrell Bank, Here We Come in 1994, blending a fairly conventional guitar-based line-up with avant-garde experimentation including textural work and the incorporation of vacuum cleaners). The record gained the approval of Karlheinz Stockhausen, who wrote back to Gill after being sent a CD.\nGill and Simpson subsequently formed the electronic experimental improvising group Psychiatric Challenge. The group operated between the late 1990s and 2006, and collaborated with Lol Coxhill. Other group members included Harry Gallimore, Neil Packer, Misha Gray, Tim Lyons, Ollie Brice and Dave Jackson. \nBoth Gill and Simpson were in the art-rock/noise rock project Sebastian, which released a lone album, Hew Hoppers Base, on CDr on the Burning Shed label in 2002.\nAlong with another Psychiatric Challenge collective member, Neil Packer, Gill formed the studio-based Vivahead project, who released a succession of albums on their own Pulper Music label during the early 2000s, inspired by abstract electronica, jazz and drum and bass. He also teamed up with Warrington fusion guitarist Tony Harn to form the experimental duo Resindust, who released one eponymous album in 2002.\n\n\n=== Contemporary classical work ===\nIn the early 2020s Gill made the switch from performing to full-time contemporary classical composing, and is currently writing and releasing an ongoing series of orchestral and chamber pieces via YouTube videos, all currently realised via synthetic instruments with the hope of producing subsequent versions with live acoustic instrumentation.\nSeveral of Gill's pieces are named after places in the Warrington area, such as Stockton Heath, Culcheth, Lymm, Bewsey, Westy, Orford, Padgate, Dallam and Grasmere. In an interview with The Warrington Guardian, he admitted \"I love Warrington and I like the idea of it being put on the map, so I thought why not write a piece of music and name it after a place I’ve spent a lot of time in and been inspired by?\"\nA CD release of Gill's existing compositions is planned for a 2024 release, under the title of Parochial Chamber Works – Music Inspired by Warrington (Volume 1).\n\n\n== Influences ==\nGill currently cites Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Steve Reich and 1970s progressive rock as his main influences.\n\n\n== List of compositions ==\n\"Bewsey Fragments\" (in 2 movements, for string quartet)\n\"Westy Fragments\" (in 2 movements, for string quartet)\n\"Black Odyssey (for Janna Levin)\" (for strings)\n\"Culcheth Fanfares\" (for brass quintet)\n\"Orford Lines\" (for woodwind quintet)\n\"Padgate Spectre\" (for sextet)\n\"Bridgewater Dream\" (for flute trio)\n\"The Devil's Vertigo\" (for double string quintet)\n\"Grasmere Skirmish (for Iannis Xenakis)\" (for strings and woodwind)\n\"Sankey Valley Reverie\" (for sextet)\n\"Possible Film Music, Part 1\" (for piano and strings)\n\"Possible Film Music, Part 2\" (for strings)\n\"Possible Film Music, Part 3\" (for tuned percussion and double basses)\n\"Bagatelle 1\" (for organ)\n\"The Golden Square (for Morton Feldman)\" (for double quartet)\n\"The Phobos Diary\" (for strings and woodwind)\n\"Dallam Dialogue\" (for piccolo and bass clarinet)\n\"God's Vertigo\" (for strings and woodwind)\n\"Stockton Heath Polyphony\" (for Arnold Schoenberg) (for wind quintet)\n\"Possible Film Music, Part 6\" (for strings and chamber group)\n\"Neuroklang, part 1 (for chamber ensemble)\n\"The Lymm Variations (for Alban Berg)\" (for strings, piano and wind trio)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nParochial Chamber Works – Music Inspired by Warrington (Volume 1) (forthcoming, 2024)\n\n\n=== with Cheeky Atom ===\nJodrell Bank, Here We Come (self-released, 1994)\n\n\n=== with Psychiatric Challenge ===\nLive at Madge's Kitchen (Electronic Musik, Em000)\nIt's Just Noise (with Lol Coxhill) (Electronic Musik, Em040, 2009)\nNorthern Silence (Electronic Musik, Em107)\nFirst Recordings (Electronic Musik, Em147)\n45 Minutes for Hugh (Electronic Musik, no catalogue number)\nNoise Reduction System (Electronic Musik, no catalogue number)\nThe Bracelet on the String (Electronic Musik, no catalogue number)\nFraktured Culture (Electronic Musik, no catalogue number)\nFour Plus Five (Electronic Musik, no catalogue number)\nWhy do We Talk ?

        "content": "The Ha-Ha Case is a 1934 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington. It is the ninth in his series of novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Chief Constable Sir Clinton Driffield, the Chief Constable of a rural English county. A traditional country house mystery, the title refers to a Ha-ha a sunken fence hidden to the naked eye common on country estates. Unlike the other novels in the series which are set when they are written, this is dated a decade before its publication in 1924. In a review in the Sunday Times Dorothy L. Sayers wrote \"There is no need to say that Mr. Connington has given us a sound and interesting plot, very carefully and ingeniously worked out.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

        "content": "Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA and Puerto Rican rapper and singer Ozuna are scheduled to release their upcoming second collaborative studio album sometime in 2024, through Real Hasta la Muerte and Aura Music. The album's title has not yet been confirmed. The album will serve as a follow-up to their collaborative studio album Los Dioses (2021), as much as Anuel AA's upcoming fifth solo studio album Rompecorazones and Ozuna's sixth solo studio album Cosmo.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nAfter the release of their collaborative album Los Dioses, Anuel AA and Ozuna claimed that a second part of the project will come out. In October 2023, Ozuna announced another album with Anuel AA in a live with Puerto Rican rapper Benny Benni. In late December 2023, Ozuna stated that he is working on an album together with Anuel.\nIn 2024, Ozuna hinted on the upcoming project with the title Los Dioses 2 multiple times, even after the appearance of the artists in the single \"Bad Boy\" by Chris Jedi, Gaby Music and Dei V. \nIn March 2024, Anuel AA came as a surprise guest at Ozuna's concert in Altos de Chavón, Dominican Republic where they announced that the name of the upcoming album is unknown yet. Later the singers confirmed the project in an interview for Dominican radio host and celebrity interviewer Santiago Matías, known as Alofoke. Ozuna stated that Anuel AA and he recorded more than 20-30 songs and the album won't contain Latin trap songs and only reggaeton would be included as much as corridos tumbados songs, since he has confirmed the participation of Natanael Cano in the album. Anuel AA said that the title of the project is not decided but it won't be Los Dioses 2 because \"God is only one and nobody is bigger than him\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Patrick is an American fashion designer and retailer. He is known for being an early adopter of sustainable fashion, and is a co-founder of the eponymous Organic by John Patrick clothing label.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nPatrick was born in Delmar, New York, and grew up in the nearby hamlet of Elsmere. Patrick was raised in a self-sufficient commune where members grew their own food and often did not wear clothes. He has described his childhood as \"free-spirited\" and his parents as \"pre hippie\".\nAt age 15, Patrick opened a store in Saratoga Springs selling vintage items. He moved to New York City to become a watercolor painter, but later decided he wanted to make hats, and took a millinery class at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. Barneys New York started carrying Patrick's hat collection in 1982. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Patrick designed items for his John Patrick Collection label.\n\n\n== Organic by John Patrick ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nIn 2004, Patrick and his life partner Walter Fleming launched Organic by John Patrick, a fashion brand focused on sustainable and eco-friendly practices. Patrick attributed the company's founding to his environmentally conscious values and upbringing, as well as his desire to create positive change in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. In 2000, Patrick moved from Manhattan to an abandoned warehouse in upstate New York and began to research organic materials. That year, Patrick was one of the first designers to establish a relationship with organic farm collectives in Peru.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nKnown for their slip dresses, Organic by John Patrick is also credited with making the first organic Oxford shirt in conjunction with Creditex in Peru. Patrick has stated that minimalism is a hallmark of the brand. Florence Kane of Vogue magazine described the line as one that \"defies the crunchy conception of how a (for lack of a better word) \"green\" collection is expected to look\".\n\n\n=== Production ===\nThe production of Organic by John Patrick is done with partners in Peru, New York, Scotland, Japan and Nepal, and only uses organic fabrics. The company works with its vendors to create sustainable textiles and has helped its factories adopt more environmentally sound manufacturing methods. Organic by John Patrick has used botanical dyes, digital print techniques, recycled fabrics and organic wool yarns, and resurrected traditional practices such as hand weaving. Patrick has stated that he uses recycled materials, such as recycled polyester, in every one of his collections. In 2018, the company began working with Ni En More, a nonprofit women's sewing studio in Juarez, Mexico.\n\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nIn 2008, Organic by John Patrick was named a finalist for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award. The company also received an Honorary Award for Ethical Fashion as part of the first annual theFashionSpot Style Awards in 2013.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Retail stores ===\nPatrick owns two Communitie boutique stores in Amagansett, New York, and Marfa, Texas, which sell clothing and jewelry as well as global textiles, pottery and art. In 2021, Organic by John Patrick opened a store in Bridgehampton, New York.\n\n\n=== Advocacy ===\nIn 2008, Patrick contributed to FutureFashion White Papers, a collection of essays with a forward by Diane von Furstenberg that includes a variety of designers, models, business owners and farmers discussing the apparel and textile industries and environmental problems.\nOrganic by John Patrick has used source maps to educate buyers about how products were created and where they originated from.\n\n\n=== The John Patrick Show ===\nIn April 2010, a six-episode TV show about Patrick called The John Patrick Show was greenlit for Discovery's Planet Green channel. However, the show ultimately did not air.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPatrick is a china ink painter. His life partner is Organic by John Patrick cofounder Walter Fleming.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVogue list of Organic by John Patrick collections",

        "content": "Freemasonry under the Second Empire found itself under the tutelage of Napoleon III's authoritarian Empire. The Second Empire saw Freemasonry, and Freemasons in general, as a threat, and aimed to either control it or wipe it out. Refusing to submit to imperial rule, some Freemasons chose exile and embarked for England. To survive, the Grand Orient de France, the main Masonic obedience, and French Freemasonry in general - as they had during the revolutionary and First Empire periods - had to accept major concessions. To avoid dissolution, they opted for the \"prince's protectors\" solution, who were responsible for taking control. The authoritarian period saw the banning of political debate, and the fading and downsizing of the lodges, which suffered from low membership levels, before experiencing new dynamics and a new boom during the liberal period of the Second Empire.\nDuring the 1870 war, the obediences did not support imperial policy and tended to be pacifist. After the defeat at Sedan and the proclamation of the Republic, they called for the fight against the Prussian armies and broke off relations with German Freemasonry. In 1871, while the obediences kept their distance from the Paris Commune, some Freemasons openly joined the ranks of the federates, while others called for conciliation to avoid confrontation.\nFrench Freemasonry demonstrated its ability to adapt to the constraints of imperial power. However, it was also fragmented, with conflicts and dissensions between lodges and between obediences, sometimes between generations of Freemasons, which focused on the duration of the often very long presidencies of lodges, or with conflicts of a political nature between republicans and anti-republicans. An anti-clerical current born of the Restoration surely took hold throughout this period. Despite this fragmentation, the flexibility of Masonic institutions and the ability to adapt at national and local levels enabled Freemasonry in France to maintain itself through institutions malleable enough to accommodate all regimes.\nFrench Freemasonry became more openly involved in social debate during this pivotal period. The Grand Orient de France, while remaining an initiatory order, evolved into a philosophical and political society, adopting as its motto the republican triptych - Liberty - Equality - Fraternity, prefiguring its commitment to society and its political action during the Third Republic.\n\n\n== Masonic landscape ==\n\nThe election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, helped by the victory of the conservative parties on May 13, 1849, propelled many Freemasons into opposition and sometimes underground. The coup d'état of December 2, 1851, silenced the republicans in the Masonic lodges. The most vindictive members were arrested or deported, while others were outlawed or chose to go into exile in England.\nThe Grand Orient de France (GODF), France's leading Masonic obedience, was already undergoing a sociological transformation in the years leading up to the coup d'état. New members were often close to positivist currents, joining other members who were Saint-Simonians, followers of Fourierism, or Proudhonians. This mixture of liberal currents and socialist utopia was muzzled during the imperial era but animated a form of republican rebellion within the Masonic order.\nLodges in the provinces were the hardest hit by the new regime; during the years of authoritarian rule, more than half were demolished. Lodges in Paris were also greatly reduced, although at the same time, lodges close to the government were created, such as those with the evocative names of \"Saint Lucien\" or \"Bonaparte\", which brought together the elite and those close to the regime. However, the intermingling of members from diverse backgrounds, with crafts and commerce in the majority, was the seed of a current hostile to the Grand Master, and of a tendency to work for the downfall of a \"protector\" it considered imposed by those in power.\n\nThe Suprême Conseil de France, France's second-largest obedience, which practices the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, reports a smaller number of lodges; it has very few lodges in the provinces, but shares a liberal spirit with the Grand Orient, albeit with a highly hierarchical and less democratic structure. It lost some of its more progressive lodges after abstaining from supporting the Second Republic in 1848. Resisting the injunctions of power during the authoritarian period, these lodges evolved in the same direction as those of the Grand Orient during the liberal period.\nThe masonic landscape under the Second Empire also revealed a mixed freemasonry that was maintained through a few lodges or initiatives. The Grande Loge d'adoption de l'obédience de Misraïm (Grand Adoption Lodge of the Misraïm obedience) had around thirty members at the start of the Empire and practiced adoption masonry. In addition, Luc-Pierre Richard-Gardon founded the \"Temple des familles\", a mixed Masonic organization that also practiced a rite of adoption and welcomed several prominent women from the bourgeoisie, often cultured and feminist. Some lodges and Freemasons supported women's membership of Masonic obediences, but these positions were not supported and were the subject of rebukes.  At the same time, questions about women's rights, particularly within the family, were being debated within the lodges: Freemasons such as Léon Richer, Jules Simon and Eugène Pelletan openly advocated greater rights and improved status for women in society.\nBetween 1860 and 1870, the Second Empire continued France's colonial expansion, and Masonic lodges followed the settlers. Freemasonry had already been present in Algeria since 1831, with the \"Cirnus\" and \"Bélisaire\" lodges in Algiers. They were mainly composed of colonial army officers. The \"Bélisaire\" lodge had over 120 members in 1860; it expanded several times and set up numerous workshops throughout the country. After the coup d'état in 1852, a dozen lodges had around 900 members. However, the Masonic presence remained marginal about a population of two and a half million Algerians and 100,000 Europeans. Between 1852 and 1870, the number of Grand Orient de France lodges in Algeria did not exceed a dozen, and, like the lodges in metropolitan France, they saw the spread of liberal ideas and anticlericalism towards all religions. Morocco and Tunisia also saw the arrival of lodges on their territory from the 1860s, within the same framework and according to the same sociology. As in Algeria, settlers and the military did not make it easy for Muslims and Jews to join Freemasonry.\nIf French Freemasonry demonstrated a form of adaptability during the imperial period, passing from a Bonapartist Grand Master of the Grand Orient de France, in the person of Lucien Murat in 1852, cousin of the emperor, an authoritarian and religious man, who unhesitatingly demolished several Republican lodges, to the journalist Léonide Babaud-Laribière, elected Grand Master in 1870, an avowed secularist and republican, is mainly due to the political and social evolution of French obediences between 1851 and 1870. Despite this ability to adapt, Freemasonry was also fragmented, with conflicts and dissensions between lodges and between obediences, sometimes between generations of Freemasons who focused on the often very long duration of lodge presidencies under the Second Empire. Another source of conflict was political, between Republicans and anti-republicans, often Bonapartists, conservatives, or, more rarely, monarchists. Despite this fragmentation, the flexibility of the Masonic institution and its ability to adapt at both national and local levels enabled it to maintain itself through institutions that were sufficiently malleable to get through this period while continuing to evolve.\n\n\n== History of the obediences ==\n\n\n=== Grand Orient de France ===\nWith the advent of the Second Empire and Napoleon III on December 2, 1852, the Grand Orient de France was without a Grand Master: Joseph Bonaparte, elected to the post on December 5, 1804, died in 1844 without returning his office, even though the position had been vacant since 1815 when he went into exile. An election was nevertheless scheduled for December 1851, following the resignation of Marie-Auguste Desanlis. Esprit-Eugène Hubert, the new secretary of the GODF, was warned by a member of his family, François Certain de Canrobert, that all Masons risked arrest if they gathered for the election. The Prefect of Police sent the GODF an order to suspend Masonic lodge meetings until January 1, 1852. At the same time, an anti-Masonic campaign swept the country. Considered a threat by those in power, Freemasonry was obliged, as in the past, to accept concessions to avoid dissolution. Several dignitaries, including Adolphe Perier, General Secretary and nephew of Casimir Perier, suggested turning to the \"prince protector\" solution. Agreement was reached on the person of Prince Lucien Murat, initiated in Austria in 1821.\n\n\n=== 1852 - 1862: Prince Murat's great mastery ===\n\nLucien Murat's election to the Grand Mastership was more sudden than deliberate, and was greeted with circumspection by the Freemasons of the Grand Orient de France. The order's council and the Masonic convent of January 9, 1852, approved the choice \"unanimously\", 27 members opposed to this forced appointment having left the assembly before the vote. On January 23, he was installed Grand Master of the Masonic Order in France; on January 27, he was elevated from the 18th to the 33rd and final degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.\nDespite this appointment, around a hundred lodges were suspended in 1852. Lucien Murat's first initiatives were not widely accepted: the dismissal of the much-appreciated secretary Eugène Hubert, the purchase of the Hôtel de Richelieu on rue Cadet in August 1852 for the sum of 450,000 gold francs, which threatened to weigh heavily on the Order's finances, and the confirmation of his authoritarianism prompted many members to maintain the most elementary reserve. In 1853, he took various measures to reinforce his power, and in 1854, a convent endowed the obedience with a \"Bonapartist constitution\", the first article of which was extensively revised to impose \"the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and the love of mankind\" as its basis, and granted him vast powers. This functional and dogmatic tutelage led to a drop in the number of lodges: from 327 in 1853, the Grand Orient counted just 167 in 1858. As a consequence of the Grand Master's Caesarism, several dozen Masonic workshops that resisted this submission to the government stopped paying dues and were suspended by the Grand Master's council.\nLucien Murat created a dogmatic institute in 1856 to take control of the Masonic high ranks before being appointed Grand Commander, continuing to draw opposition to him. Successive convents were the object of conflict between the executive and disgruntled members of the order. In 1860, the Grand Orient's growing mistrust of him was accompanied by the convents' rejection of many of his proposals: his proposal to set up a mutual aid society, seen as an attempt to transform the purpose of the Grand Orient, was widely rejected. As a senator, Lucien Murat supported and voted in favor of maintaining the presence of French troops in the papal city, amid Italy's attempts at unification. In total contradiction with his status as a Freemason, he supported the proposal of the ultramontanes and Catholic clergy, who were opposed to Freemasonry. From then on, criticism of him was publicly voiced, mainly by Luc-Pierre Richard-Gardon. In the May/June 1861 issue of L'Initiation ancienne et moderne, Richard-Gardon asserted that Prince Murat could not hold two opposing views, given that in Rome he supported a power that persecuted Freemasons, while in France he asserted himself as a protector of Freemasons. The Grand Master's reaction was swift: the journal was temporarily suspended.\nThe crisis became inevitable, as Lucien Murat stood for re-election as Grand Master in 1861: supporters and opponents clashed, first through communications in the Lodges and then at the 1861 Convent. Subsequently, a campaign developed within the Lodges to promote the election of Prince Napoléon-Jérôme, who had violently opposed the proposal to maintain troops in Italy. On May 21, a meeting of delegates at the Hôtel rue Cadet elected Prince Napoléon by 98 delegates out of 152. On May 23, the Prefect Symphorien Boittelle issued a decree halting the process and forbidding Freemasons to meet to elect a Grand Master before the end of October. The unrest surrounding this election caused Prince Napoleon to withdraw. Negotiations to reconcile the two camps failed, and the Order found itself on the brink of collapse. Faced with the impasse and the lack of agreement, the authorities decided to settle the matter. The Emperor requested Lucien Murat's resignation and signed a decree on January 11, 1862, appointing Marshal Bernard Pierre Magnan \"Grand Master of the Masonic Order of France\", putting an end for a time to the deep crisis shaking French Masonry.\n\n\n=== 1862 - 1865: Marshal Magnan's great mastery ===\n\nMarshal Bernard Pierre Magnan, a career military officer, found himself at the head of a Grand Orient de France that was in no position to oppose this imperial decision. His appointment presented a unique problem in the history of the Grand Orient: Marshal Magnan was not a Freemason at the time of his appointment on January 11, 1862. Appointed for three years, he was initiated on February 6, 1862, and received the 33 grades of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite on the same day. Almost all the workshops accepted the facts without resistance; only two lodges objected to this un-Masonic procedure. Despite his soldierly past, Marshal Magnan was not inclined to be lenient, and he won the sympathy of some of the Grand Orient's Freemasons by quickly reversing almost all of his predecessor's decisions. However, the appointment of a military officer to head the obedience was a sign of the imperial power's desire to maintain control over Freemasonry. The paternal attitude of the new Grand Master was not enough to appease the leaders of Prince Murat's protest. The Grand Orient nevertheless experienced a revival in the creation of lodges, increasing from 190 in 1862 to 230 in 1865. Marshal Magnan then decided to implement several reforms, some without much success.\nHis first failure was to unify French Masonic obediences, which were ordered to recognize his authority and join the Grand Orient de France. The small obedience of Jean Étienne Marconis de Nègre and his four \"Egyptian lodges\" of the Memphis Rite complied. On the other hand, the Supreme Council of France and its 50 lodges, presided over by Jean-Pons-Guillaume Viennet, strongly opposed this forced integration. When he took over as head of the Supreme Council, Guillaume Viennet inherited, at the age of 87, an obedience in good working order, which had kept out of the Grand Orient's quarrels with the imperial power, showed great respect for the authorities and was mainly active in philanthropic actions. On February 1, 1862, the Grand Master ordered the lodges of the Supreme Council to merge into the Grand Orient. Grand Commander Viennet's negative response was swift and straightforward: in a detailed letter, he confirmed the impossibility of submitting to this order, arguing that the two obediences were distinct and that Magnan's appointment as head of the Grand Orient had no effect on the Supreme Council, whose powers he held as legatee of an illustrious line of Freemasonsn 5,q 23. During a meeting with Napoleon III, the latter confirmed his desire to merge the two obediences. Resisting this imperial pressure, Guillaume Viennet pointed out that the constitutions of the Supreme Council did not authorize mergers with other Masonic obediences, and invited the Emperor, who had the power to do so, to dissolve the Supreme Council if he so wished. Marshal Magnan persisted in pushing through the imperial project, and issued a decree on February 23 dissolving the Supreme Council and threatening the Scottish Lodges with illegality if they did not submit. Guillaume Viennet quickly rejected this communication, declaring the decree null and void and pointing out that only the Emperor could dissolve the Order. At the Grand Master's Council of June 3, Magnan faced an internal challenge calling for his departure. He refused to resign and acknowledged his failure, as the authorities had refused to close the recalcitrant lodges.\nMarshal Magnan suffered another major setback when the 1865 convent of the Grand Orient refused to approve his proposal to transform obedience into an \"institution of public utility\". The idea was approved by the order's council, who saw it not only as a means of recognizing Freemasonry, but also as a financial opportunity to alleviate the Grand Orient's debt since the purchase of the Hôtel Richelieu. Only one of the Order's councillors, André Roussel, was opposed to the change, and while he was unable to rally any other councilors to his cause, he did manage to convince many of the convent's delegates of the disadvantages. His argument sought to demonstrate that the transformation into a large relief society would lead to the \"inevitable ruin\" of masonry by subjecting it to civil power, the ideal means of controlling and monitoring it closely. The reform was rejected by 123 votes to 63.\nDespite several setbacks, in 1864 Marshal Magnan obtained from the Emperor the return of a fundamental right for Grand Orient Freemasons - the right to designate their Grand Master. The restoration of this right enabled him to regain great popularity with Parisian and provincial lodges. The convent re-elected him with almost all delegates. He did not have time to take advantage of this new legitimacy, as he died suddenly on May 29, 1865, on the eve of the convent. His religious funeral was celebrated by Georges Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, who officiated over a coffin covered with Masonic emblems. On June 9, the convent chooses a new Grand Master in the person of General Émile Mellinet.\n\n\n=== 1865 - 1870: the great mastery of General Mellinet ===\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Émile Mellinet was a long-standing Freemason. The son and grandson of a Freemason, he was initiated at the age of 16 in Thionville, before being raised to Companion, then Master in the Nantes lodge \"Mars et les Arts\". At the time of his election as Grand Master, he was commander of the Seine National Guard. When he was elected, the Order's council was also largely renewed: the \"centrists\", such as philosopher Charles Fauvety and lawyer Achille Jouaust, were in the majority.  In this liberal period of the Empire, the five years of General Mellinet's Grand Mastership had little impact on French Freemasonry. During his tenure, which spanned the period from the death of Marshal Magnan to the fall of the Empire, lodges enjoyed a certain degree of freedom, and recruitment was more broadly based in circles often opposed to the Empire. Workshops focused on progressive themes, such as the admission of women to Freemasonry, and on the deteriorating relations with the Catholic Church, which led to a rise in anti-clericalism in the lodges. However, under his presidency, the GODF grew from 230 to 292 lodges. Tired of the many quarrels between supporters and opponents of compulsory belief in God, but also keen to indulge his cultural passions in his hometown, he did not seek re-election, despite being widely re-elected by the June 1870 convent. Acknowledging his choice, the conventuals elected the secular, republican journalist Léonide Babaud-Laribière as Grand Master.\n\n\n==== Evolution of the obedience and lodges ====\nDuring this period, the GODF, while remaining an initiatory society, was slowly transforming into a philosophical and more political society. The ban on openly political debates within lodges did not prevent members from discussing societal or religious issues. The 1865 encyclical Quanta cura, which violently attacked modernity in general and the \"Masonic sect\" in particular, accusing it of conspiring against the Catholic Church and the government, reinforced the anti-clericalism latent since the Restoration within a Freemasonry that was increasingly attracting young Republicans and openly agnostic or atheist members. This evolution contributed to the questioning of the obligation to believe in God enshrined in the Grand Orient's constitution since 1849. While some lodges in Paris and the provinces were content with a Masonic practice centered on benevolence and fraternal sociability, others debated justice, the abolition of the death penalty, divorce or the social role of women in a new society yet to be built. Lodges remained aloof from totally political subjects, however, to avoid repression from the authorities. The liberalization of the regime and the return of the proscribed favored a broad diversification of the work of the lodges, which significantly increased their membership, mainly in areas where the Republican Party was very active. Documentation does not allow us to establish the precise sociological composition of the lodges, although their numbers increased significantly during the liberal period. Lodges in the capital, however, were largely republican; in the provinces, the situation was less homogeneous, as several lodges were openly Bonapartist, often provoking internal conflicts. The vast majority of Bonapartist Freemasons left Freemasonry with the advent of the Third Republic. From 1865, an independent Masonic press began to appear, such as La Chaîne d'union, which published reports of lodge debates. The obedience's annual convents also tended to become politicized, with the 1870 meeting unanimously supporting the petition for free and compulsory education organized by the Ligue de l'enseignement. Adopted in 1849, the triple principle of Liberty - Equality - Fraternity officially became the Order's motto.\n\n\n=== French Supreme Council ===\n\nFrance's second-largest obedience, the Suprême Conseil de France was headed by Guillaume Viennet from 1860. He enjoyed great popularity within his order, having successfully opposed the attempted absorption of the Grand Orient de France. All political or religious discussions were statutorily forbidden, a prohibition common to all obediences in France. The Council's refusal to support the 1848 revolution led to its first split: the most progressive members founded a \"Grande Loge Nationale de France\", whose constitutions embodied republican ideals. It was quickly banned in January 1851 for refusing to exclude political and social issues from its loges debates. While still held in high esteem, Guillaume Viennet was criticized for voting against Émile Littré's admission to the Académie française in 1863. In the years 1865-1870, the Supreme Council followed an identical evolution to that of the Grand Orient; Guillaume Viennet, however, had little idea of the internal evolution of the Lodges, whose sensibility was increasingly similar to that of the Grand Orient, and which, like those of that obedience, were beginning to question the obligation of belief in God contained in the General Statutes.\nThe 40 or so lodges of the Supreme Council are mainly based in Paris, with few in the provinces. They are very active and sometimes more offensive than those of the Grand Orient. The most prestigious lodge was \"L'Écossaise 133\", which created the magazine Le monde maçonnique and led the protest against the governing bodies in 1868. Guillaume Viennet's death put an end to the crisis, and the new Grand Commander appointed a popular and well-liked figure, Adolphe Crémieux, as 1st Vice-President. The Lodges were also home to a radical current with Henri Brisson, Charles Floquet, Camille Raspail, and Gustave Mesureur.\n\n\n== Freemasons in exile ==\nFreemasons exiled mainly to the British Isles came in different waves linked to political events in France. The first stemmed from the insurrectionary days and riots of 1848, the second from the failed demonstration of June 13, 1849 in opposition to the policies pursued in Rome by the government of the Second Republic, and the last from the founding coup d'état of the Second Empire. From the British Isles, a Freemasonry with a revolutionary foundation.\nIn 1850, publicist Jean Phillipe Berjeau, editor of the international political column La voix du proscrit, founded a London lodge under the auspices of the Memphis Rite created by Jean Étienne Marconis de Nègre, which gave rise to a Grand Lodge of Philadelphians. Around this grand lodge, a fraternal society of socialist democrats, open to all, worked to bring together the proscribed. Many prominent figures were active in these societies and lodges, including Louis Blanc, Félix Pyat, and Jean-Baptiste Boichot, who returned to France to organize the democrat-socialist movement. Arrested following a denunciation, he was released in 1859. The Philadelphes Lodge became a haven for all republican tendencies. Many of its members were also active in the International Association of Revolutionaries.\n\n\n== War of 1870 ==\n\nLéonide Babaud-Laribière Grand Master of the Grand Orient de France. On the eve of the 1870 war, the two French obediences were led by bourgeois personalities. They became predominantly liberal and republican, the idea of Freemasonry as heir to the French Revolution became widespread, and anticlericalism became more pronounced with the presence of a radical Grandissant current.\nThe pacifist movement was also well established in French lodges when war was declared. Freemasons such as Edmond Potonié-Pierre, founder of the \"Ligue universelle du bien public\" (Universal League for the Public Good), led this movement. The Supreme Council magazine Le monde maçonnique highlighted the importance of the \"League for Peace\" in its columns. Lodges joined the \"Peace Union\" founded in Le Havre in 1866. The Grand Orient de France signed friendship treaties with several German obediences; reciprocal visits between French and German workshops were widely authorized. The French obediences took no position on the declaration of war, thereby demonstrating their distrust of imperial foreign policy choices. In August 1870, the Order's Council voted to implement humanitarian measures aimed at helping Freemasons in the armed forces and war victims, whatever their nationality. To a lesser extent, European obediences such as the Grand Orient of Italy and the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina launched a manifesto in favor of peace. For its part, the Grand Orient of Belgium condemned German policy and promoted the opening of military hospitals. While members of French Masonic orders generally did their duty, Léonide Babaud-Laribière, Grand Master of the Grand Orient, considered the declaration of war to be the Empire's \"supreme folly \".\nThe defeat at Sedan, the fall of the Empire, and the proclamation of the Republic put an end to pacifist actions. Many Freemasons joined the provisional government, and some forty, including Léonide Babaud-Laribière, were appointed prefects. From then on, a large number of lodges supported the war against the \"Prussian invader\" and the defense of the new republic. During the siege of Paris, a dozen Parisian lodges of the Grand Orient took part in an unusual action concerning the allegedly anti-Masonic conduct of William I, Grand Master of Prussian Freemasonry, and his son. A severely worded manifesto was published denouncing the bombing and burning of cities, and accusing the two monarchs of treason, perjury, and dishonesty. Added to this is a denunciation of the fanaticization of the German people by the monarch and his heir around sectarian Protestantism, making them responsible for the deaths of a million men. The document ends with an appeal to German Freemasons to \"cast off the chains of servitude and turn to social progress\".\nThe widely circulated manifesto was echoed in the press and within the Order; Jean-Claude Colfavru, a former outlaw, agreed to preside over a general assembly of \"mise en jugement\" held on October 29, attended by over 1,500 Freemasons who took part in the debate. In the end, some one hundred lodges signed a \"Masonic indictment\" to be transmitted to the Prussian authorities, carried by a delegation requesting safe conduct from the government to reach the Prussian siege lines. The revolutionary day of October 31st postponed the project, which was subsequently abandoned. The German Grand Lodges protested against the manifesto, broke off relations with the Grand Orient, and demanded a public disavowal of the accusations. The Grand Orient responded with a commission of inquiry into the behavior of German Freemasonry during the war but did not publish the results.\n\n\n== Commune de Paris ==\nThe Paris Commune insurrection began on March 18, 1871: the government led by Adolphe Thiers and the mayor of Paris, Jules Ferry, accompanied by numerous troops and civil servants, left Paris for Versailles. The Parisian elected representatives included between 18 and 24 Freemasons out of a total of 86. One faction wanted to join the Commune, while another, led by Charles Floquet, wanted only to reconcile Versailles and Paris. Two opinions were clearly expressed within Freemasonry: those of the \"advanced \" lodges, mainly in Paris, and those of the lodges that remained legalistic.\nFreemasons were to be found in both camps: like Louis Blanc, who disavowed the insurrection, the vast majority of Freemason politicians sided with the government, but some Parisian Freemasons, like Félix Pyat and Jules Vallès, were sympathizers or supporters of the Commune and joined the fighting.\nOn the morning of April 29, a procession of Freemasons holding banners bearing the insignia of their orders crossed the streets of Paris. They headed for the city limits, sending the Versaillais a peace delegation in vain14. By the end of Bloody Week and the crushing of the insurrection, almost two hundred Freemasons had died in the fighting. However, the governing bodies of the obediences protected themselves from any accusation of complicity with the Commune by roundly condemning the actions of Communard Freemasons. The Grand Master of the Grand Orient sent a statement to the workshops denouncing \"criminal sedition\" and blaming the individual actions of \"unworthy members\" who were tarnishing the Order's peacemaking work. On the part of the French Supreme Council, the Grand Secretary General pointed to \"the regrettable conduct of a few\" who were jeopardizing Freemasonry as a whole. Some Parisian lodges expelled members for involvement in the insurrection; in the provinces, lodges remained generally cautious during the events, hesitating between silence and condemnation.\nHistorical documentation shows that two conceptions of Freemasonry were active during the Commune, without openly clashing. Some members, mainly from Paris, supported or participated in the insurrection, adhering to the idea that Freemasons should be in the vanguard of social movements to spearhead social change. Another part, which respects the individual choice of its members, while inviting them to limit themselves to humanitarian and conciliatory actions, stands aside. The documentation also reveals a political difference between Parisian and provincial lodges. The obediences generally took no sides as institutions and remained legalistic. However, Freemasons, and sometimes lodges, took part in events according to their convictions.\n\n\n== End of the Empire ==\nDuring the Second Empire, the city of Paris asserted itself as the center of French Freemasonry, with lodges that were part of different and sometimes complex sociabilities; nevertheless, they were representative of an enlightened bourgeoisie that recognized the importance of education. Internal debates culminated in the creation of the Symbolic Scottish Grand Lodge in 1880, in response to the democratic aspirations of some of the members of the French Supreme Council, and the birth of mixed Freemasonry with Droit humain in 1893.\nThe arrival of atheist freethinkers in its ranks led to changes and evolutions within this predominantly deist masonry for some time to come. By the end of the Empire, it was completely on the Republican side. By the end of this period, the Grand Orient had become the backbone and school of the Republican party, revealing the important role Freemasonry was to play in French society during the Third Republic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFreemasonry\nSecond French Empire\nFrench Third Republic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nQueruel (pref.

        "content": "Kalapurnasuri (1924–2002) was a Jain ascetic, philosopher and author of the Śvetāmbara sect. He was given the title of Adhyatmayogi based on his advanced spirituality and knowledge of scriptures.\n\n\n== Early life and marriage ==\nHe was born in a Marwari Jain family to Pabudanji and Khamabai on May 5, 1924 (Vaishakh Sud 2, Vikram Samvat 1980) at Phalodi, Rajasthan. His parents named him Akshayraj.\nHe exhibited an innate affinity towards the religion and its practices since a young age. Under the guidance of his maternal uncle Shri Manekchandji, he received early training in Jain rituals. He regularly performed Snaatra Puja (ritualistic bathing of the Tirthankara idols emulating the bathing of a Tirthankara performed by Indra right after a Tirthankara's birth) and other religious rituals in temples. He had also memorized several hymns, and sutras.\nDespite familial responsibilities, Akshayraj maintained a devout lifestyle, balancing his professional duties with rigorous religious observances. His marriage to a pious and courteous Ratanben at the age of 16 did not deter his spiritual pursuits; instead, it strengthened his resolve to embrace celibacy and pursue a life dedicated to Jain principles. He also had two sons - Gyanchand and Ashkaran.\n\n\n== Initiation ==\nIn a transformative moment, at the age of 27, Akshayraj resolved to renounce worldly life. At that time, a courteous Ratanben wrote to her father Shri Mishrimalji in an attempt to convince him to talk to Akshayraj out of it. However, Mishrilalji was himself planning on renunciation. With this decision, Akshayraj and Ratanben, as well as their sons Gyanchand and Ashkaran along with Mishrilalji decided to renounce their worldly life under the guidance of revered monks. Mishrilalji had already decided that he would become a monk under Acharya Kanaksuri. Akshayraj accepted his decision wholeheartedly.\nIn 1952 (Vikram Samvat 2009) Akshayraj and Mishrilalji met Acharya Kanaksuri at Palitana. They were advised to read and learn religious scriptures before renunciation.\nAkshayraj began his religious studies at Ahmedabad Vidyashala under the guidance of the highly revered Acharya Siddhisuri. Ratanben studied under the guidance of Sadhvishri Nirmalashriji at Bhavnagar. On completion of their studies, Acharya Kanaksuri decided to initiate all the five members of Akshayraj's family. On May 12, 1954 (Vaishakh Vad 10 of Vikram Samvat 2010), under the tutelage of Shri Ratnakarvijay and Shri Kanchanvijayji, they were initiated at Phalodi, Rajasthan.\nHe was renamed as Muni Kalapurnavijay while Ratanben was renamed Sadhvi Swarnaprabhashreeji. Mishrilalji was renamed Muni Kalaghotvijay, and both the sons were renamed as Muni Shri Kalaprabhvijay and Muni Shri Kalpataruvijay. Kalapurnavijay and Kalaghotvijay were declared as Acharya Kanaksuri's disciples while baal munis (child ascetics) Kalaprabhvijay and Kalpataruvijay were declared as disciples of Kalapurnavijay.\nAs a muni, he embarked on a journey of self-realization and spiritual growth by immersing himself in deep study of the scriptures. On completing Chaturmaas (Monsoon season) at Phalodi, Rajasthan, Kalapurnavijay and Kalaghotvijay proceeded towards Radhanpur, Gujarat where his Vadi Diksha (main initiation ceremony) took place under the tutelage of Acharya Kanaksuri.\n\n\n== Ascetic Life ==\nAfter the ceremony at Radhanpur, Acharya Kanaksuri sent him to Acharya Premsuri to learn Karmasiddhant. He spent two years studying it. Later he also studied Nyaydarshan under Pandit Vajralalbhai in Jamnagar.\nAfter 15 years of monkhood, Acharya Devendrasuri bestowed upon him, the position of a Panyas at Phalodi in 1968. Later in 1971, he was given the title of an Acharya at Bhadreshwar and was since then called Acharya Shrimad Vijay Kalapurnasurishwar Maharaja.\nAs a monk, he exhibited a high degree of restraint and devotion. After meeting Panyas Bhadrankarvijay at Kutch, he received valuable guidance on the realization of meditation and philosophy. He undertook great penances, and after each discourse he used to spend hours in front of Tirthankara idols, immersed in devotion. Kalapurnasuri spent most of his life spreading Jainism in Chennai, Bangalore, Coimbatore, and Rajnandgaon. In matters of devotion, he had immense reverence and devotion towards Shankheshwar Parshvanath. He spent hours in the temple, just looking at the main idol.\n\n\n== Temple & Idol Consecration Ceremonies ==\n\nIn 1994, the two-storeyed Chandraprabhu Swami Naya Mandir was constructed under his guidance and the temple as well as the images were consecrated by him. In 1995, a grand temple was constructed within the premises of the Kesarwadi Tirth in Pulhal, Chennai under his guidance. The temple houses an idol of Parshvanatha consecrated by him. It also houses a Bhaktāmara Stotra Temple in the basement. On May 23, 1996, Kalapurnasuri consecrated a temple with Sambhavanatha as the main deity in Vepery. Apart from these temples in Chennai, he also consecrated many in Bangalore and Gujarat.\n\n\n== Literary Works & Contributions ==\nAs an ascetic, he also wrote several scriptural texts and their interpretations as well as commentaries. Some of his most popular works have been listed below: -\n\nKahe Kalapurnasuri \nSarvagya Kathit Param Samayik Dharm \nHaimanushasana Trikam \nDhyanavichar \nParam Tattvani Upasana \nSahaj Samadhi \nPrachin Sajjhay Mahodadhi Sachitra \n\n\n== Death & Legacy ==\nDuring the early hours of February 16, 2002, he felt uneasy when he was rushed from Keshavana to Jalore Hospital. He passed away before he could reach the hospital. His followers say he was chanting \"Chandesu Nimmalayara\" during the time he was feeling uneasy and his followers were chanting the Uvasaggaharam Stotra and other holy recitations. His final rites were performed at Shankheshwar, as he was most devoted to this idol of Shankheshwar Parshvanath.\nHis legacy remains as one of the most popular ones till date. He and his sons were the first Gacchadhipatis in sequence belonging to the same immediate family.\nA shibir (religious school) for the youth has been organised under his name. Several works of philanthropy are performed in his name by his followers. A biography on his life called Kalapurna Prabodh has also been written by his followers. Further, his teachings and quotes have been compiled into a series of books titled Kahe Kalapurnasuri.\nBetween 2006 and 2023, a huge pilgrimage site with a grand Jain temple was built by his followers at Deolali and it was named after him, Kalapurnam.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDevluk,Nandlal B.2010.

        "content": "In the early 2000s, significant political changes took place in Russia with Vladimir Putin's rise to power. Putin, who previously held key positions in the security forces and government, became the successor to President Boris Yeltsin.\nAfter serving as the head of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and as Secretary of the Security Council in August 1999, Vladimir Putin became the head of the government. On December 31, 1999, following the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed Acting President. He was first elected President of Russia on March 26, 2000, and then re-elected in 2004, 2012, 2018, and 2024.\n\n\n== Situation in Russia ==\nThe political situation in Russia in the late 1990s was challenging. This period, known as the \"wild 90s,\" was characterized by social and economic instability, a rise in crime, and the weakening of state institutions both domestically and internationally. President Boris Yeltsin suffered from health problems and alcoholism. He was not eligible to run for a third term according to the Russian constitution. Yeltsin remained energetic and focused in the face of emerging problems, but when it came to the strategic development of the state, he lacked a specific plan.\nThere was also a growing sense of separatist sentiment in the country, especially in Chechnya, where the conflict remained unresolved. The 1998 financial crisis posed a serious challenge to Russia. Against the backdrop of the upcoming 2000 presidential elections, the political situation remained tense and uncertain.\nRussia had already experienced limitations on political competition during the 1996 elections. After the 1996 elections, Yeltsin's health problems weakened his influence. His daughter and son-in-law established schemes to enrich themselves and those close to the oligarchic family. With an impending change of power in the country, Yeltsin's family and the oligarchs feared for their finances and security, preferring to retain their power and influence. After the 1998 crisis, there were no longer advocates for democracy within Yeltsin's circle, and in 1999, those in power did not want, but rather sought the ability to choose Yeltsin's successor themselves. There was a growing demand for strengthening state power from society. Yeltsin did not see Yevgeny Primakov, who had led the government since 1998, as his successor because he was too closely associated with Gorbachev and the Soviet era. This situation created uncertainty on the eve of the transition to new leadership in the country.\n\n\n== Operation \"Successor\" ==\nOperation \"Successor\" was a strategic plan developed by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his inner circle to prepare a successor for the presidency. A distinctive feature of this operation was the lack of broad public involvement in choosing the successor, which led to a halt in democratic development in the country. Yeltsin was inspired by the ideals of American President George Washington, particularly his democratic principles. Yeltsin echoed some of his democratic decisions, particularly distancing himself from any Russian political party. However, unlike Washington, who allowed Americans to freely choose their new leader upon his departure, Yeltsin chose a path that halted Russia's democratic development.\nInstead of ensuring free elections, Yeltsin considered it his right and duty to choose his successor. His strategy was to prepare and introduce his successor into the political arena without diminishing his own influence on Russia's political stage. This approach was focused on maintaining stability and strengthening personal power.\nThis strategic decision by Yeltsin demonstrates his desire to maintain control over the political situation in Russia and ensure political protection for himself and his inner circle after stepping down as president.\nThe idea of the need to prepare a successor emerged within Yeltsin's circle immediately after the 1996 presidential elections, and Yeltsin himself became involved in this after the 1998 economic crisis. Yeltsin and his friendly oligarchs, known as \"the family\", began actively seeking a competent, reliable, loyal, and sober candidate with no past ties to Yeltsin who could strengthen the state and propose and articulate the \"Russian idea\".\nThis process involved frequent change of prime ministers, with each prime minister considered a potential presidential candidate. The changes in the head of the government allowed Yeltsin's circle to carefully select candidates for subsequent promotion to the key position. By the end of 1999, the \"family\" was already seriously concerned about the future and actively sought ways to ensure their candidate's ascent to power.\nThe \"Operation \"Successor\"\", as it was called within Yeltsin's circle, consisted of two tasks. The first was to find a candidate not associated with Yeltsin himself. The second was to invent a problem that the \"successor\" would \"solve,\" thereby gaining popularity with voters. The successor's rise to power was to be achieved using methods tested in the 1996 elections: utilizing state resources and the support of oligarchic structures with which Yeltsin and his circle had close ties.\nYeltsin had a means of selecting his successor at his disposal. This mechanism was the appointment of the prime minister, a stepping stone to the presidency. Starting with Chernomyrdin, potential presidential candidates were appointed to the position of prime minister. Since 1998, Yeltsin changed six prime ministers.\nIn preparation for the successor's election, Yeltsin's circle organized a public opinion poll asking, \"Which movie character would you vote for in the elections?\" The leader turned out to be the Soviet literary and movie character, intelligence officer Stierlitz. One of the individuals working on the \"Operation Successor\" was the political technologist Gleb Pavlovsky.\nAmong the first trial candidates in the \"Operation Successor\" was the former director of the FSB, Sergei Stepashin, appointed as prime minister. Yeltsin tested him for loyalty and the ability to attract voters. Stepashin, however, sought compromises with Yeltsin's opponents, indicating that he would not staunchly defend Yeltsin from his political adversaries after his departure. Stepashin failed Yeltsin's \"tests\".\nIn August 1999, Stepashin was removed from the post of prime minister, and another former FSB director, Vladimir Putin, was appointed in his place. This move was significant in the scheme of forming a future successor and indicated Yeltsin's and his circle's desire to find a leader capable of strengthening the country's political situation and ensuring their personal security and retention of influence after Yeltsin stepped down as president.\n\n\n== Protection of Yeltsin's and the ruling elite's interests ==\nThe ruling elite, having made antidemocratic decisions, acted out of fear for their own security and a desire to preserve their material gains. In the open political struggle, there was a danger of a hostile \"president's family\" coming to power, which would begin persecuting and punishing those who had worked and prospered during Yeltsin's presidency. According to some, \"it was clear that revenge would come, and then Yeltsin, the 'family,' and everyone would perish,\" so \"a scheme was needed to transfer power to a strong [president] who would guarantee Yeltsin his personal security.\"\nTatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter, played an important role in the final decision to transfer power to Putin. As Yeltsin's health deteriorated, Dyachenko increasingly acted as an advisor and confidante to the president. She and her fiancé Valentin Yumashev had much to lose: they facilitated the involvement of oligarchs in governing the country and, consequently, could become the focus of the new president's attention. Yeltsin's dependence on his inner circle of allies, including his daughter, Yumashev, and possibly one or two more aides, increased as his health deteriorated. Yeltsin was more concerned about protecting his close circle than individual oligarchs. He was unhappy with the oligarchs' influence on people and the policies of his administration, but due to his declining health, he could not effectively combat the growing influence. Meanwhile, his inner circle was concerned about the welfare of their wealthy friends, who were worried about the future of their fortunes and themselves.\nThus, the consequences of the early decisions of 1992 continued to influence the political situation in Russia. The attempt to introduce a market economy without establishing democratic political and legal structures led to institutionalized corruption at the highest levels of power in the Kremlin. Liberal economic reforms without corresponding political mechanisms of accountability and control undermined the new system. By the end of Yeltsin's second presidential term, fear of retribution for corruption forced his circle to seek a new leader not based on qualifications or electoral legitimacy, but rather based on promises of protection and perhaps the hope that they could secretly control their puppet appointee.\n\n\n== Vladimir Putin's Career in the 1990s ==\nIn the 1990s, Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, rose from the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to a key position in the Russian government. Putin cultivated good relations with the country's elite, including oligarchs and political figures from the Yeltsin era, which contributed to his career advancement. Putin served as an advisor to Yeltsin's key ally, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, which helped him establish connections in the political elite.\nPutin's appointment as prime minister in 1999 was a recognition of his respect and support from the \"Family\" - a group of oligarchs rallying around Yeltsin. They saw in Putin not only a successor but also a defender of Yeltsin's interests and their own. Yeltsin and his circle expected Putin to protect them from political opponents and ensure victory in elections.\nPutin demonstrated his loyalty and dedication to Yeltsin even before his appointment as prime minister, while he was the director of the FSB. He assisted in the removal of Yuri Skuratov, the Prosecutor General and a critic of Yeltsin (\"informally coordinating security services in the interests of Yeltsin's political opponents\"), by providing compromising material. This diverted the attention of the prosecutors away from the oligarchs, securing them, and strengthened his position and Yeltsin's trust. Putin was promoted to the position of Secretary of the Security Council of Russia. Putin demonstrated his reliability and loyalty as a potential successor.\nThe process of transferring power to Putin was probably not fully planned in advance. Even Putin himself in December 1998 did not display confidence in his political future. At that time, he considered his participation in the government \"an interesting chapter in his life\" that would soon come to an end. Yeltsin announced his reluctance to run for a third presidential term, and Putin believed that his time in the government was coming to an end - \"the future president, of course, would want to have a qualified person loyal to himself, it is clear that I will have to leave. Boris Nikolaevich knows that I am completely calm about this.\" Then, in the eyes of society and Putin himself, Yevgeny Primakov seemed the most likely successor. Putin even hoped to earn Primakov's trust and get appointed to lead his former special unit in the FSB.\nPutin enjoyed active support in state and oligarch-controlled media. He was portrayed as an energetic, decisive leader capable of protecting Russia from internal and external threats. Putin's popularity soared. A relatively unknown \"apparatchik\" even to the Russian elite became the most popular politician in just a few months: if in August 1999 only 2% of voters were ready to vote for him, by the end of the year, support had increased to 51%. This growth was the result of active support in the media and from the oligarchic elite, which sought to preserve its influence in the future Russian political landscape.\n\n\n== 1999 apartment bombings and the Chechen war ==\n\nIn August 1999, Yeltsin appointed Putin to lead the war against the rebellious Chechnya. Putin conducted the war with great publicity, appearing on TV and demonstrating determination to suppress the uprising.\nA series of explosions of residential buildings that occurred in Russia in September 1999 is one of the most significant events preceding the start of the Second Chechen War. The suspicious nature of these explosions, which occurred in Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk, drew public attention and left many questions unanswered.\nAs a result of the series of coordinated explosions of multi-story residential buildings, 307 people were killed, and over 1700 were injured. These attacks not only caused panic in society but also raised questions about those responsible for the explosions. In Ryazan, local police arrested agents of the Federal Security Service (FSB), catching them planting explosives in a residential building. The FSB claimed that what happened was part of an exercise, while critics speculated about the connection of the explosions to the upcoming elections to create an atmosphere of fear to justify military actions in Chechnya.\nThe bombings and their possible connection to the authorities remain a subject of controversy. Some observers and experts suggest that these terrorist acts may have been initiated by the FSB to garner public support for the start of the Second Chechen War. These events provided Putin with additional grounds to launch a military operation in Chechnya, justifying it as a response to terrorist acts, although the responsibility for the bombings remained unresolved. The war against Chechnya received broad public support. The first weeks of the new military campaign appeared more successful than the first war. Russian forces quickly seized control of the Chechen capital, Grozny. The conflict was presented by Putin as a fight against terrorism, and he gained a reputation as a decisive leader restoring order and strength in the country. Such rhetoric resonated with a society tired of instability. After Putin was appointed prime minister, Yeltsin publicly announced his support for Putin as his successor. Analysts initially did not consider Putin a potential president - the only scenario that journalist Alexei Volin could imagine to \"help a hopeless client with low ratings and no public image\" become president was \"a little victorious war.\" Public support for the war in Chechnya allowed him to boost his ratings - every week they increased by several percent.\n\n\n== 2000 - Acting and President of Russia ==\n\nAccording to the constitution, the prime minister becomes the acting president when the current head of state steps down. On December 31, 1999, Yeltsin announced his resignation, and Vladimir Putin, who held the position of prime minister, automatically became the acting president.\nPutin's first decree as acting president, as a loyal successor, was to grant Yeltsin immunity from future corruption charges.\nAt the end of 1999, a law was passed in Russia establishing strict conditions for registering candidates for the presidency, including collecting 1 million signatures and regulating financing, which gave an advantage to candidates supported by the government.\nYeltsin's resignation led to early presidential elections, for which possible competitors to Putin were not prepared. Presidential candidates Yuri Luzhkov and Yevgeny Primakov withdrew their candidacies. By the time of Yeltsin's resignation, Putin's popularity exceeded 50%. State media and administrative resources were under the control of the acting president, which significantly contributed to his victory.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nThe absence of a democratic process in the transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin in 1999-2000 had a significant impact on Russia's political system and its further development. This period was characterized by the absence of a real democratic electoral procedure, which played a key role in shaping the country's political landscape and halted Russia's democratic development.\nSupporters of liberal views did not have the opportunity to adequately prepare and participate in the elections, capitulating and supporting the chosen successor. Similarly, centrists could not organize an election campaign. Yeltsin's resignation and Putin's appointment as acting president were predetermined, making any democratic election mechanisms merely formal. As a result, representatives of liberal and centrist forces were sidelined in the political struggle and could not organize an effective election campaign.\nСторонники либеральных взглядов не имели возможности адекватно подготовиться и участвовать в выборах, капитулировали и поддержали выбранного преемника. Точно также не могли организовать выборную кампанию и центристы. Отставка Ельцина и назначение Путина на пост исполняющего обязанности президента были предопределены, что сделало любые демократические механизмы выборов лишь формальными. Как результат, представители либеральных и центристских сил оказались вне фокуса политической борьбы и не смогли организовать эффективную выборную кампанию.\nYeltsin's decision to change power without the involvement of broad public participation in choosing a successor was an important precedent in the country's political history. This laid the groundwork for further strengthening Vladimir Putin's position in the country and the subsequent establishment of an authoritarian regime in Russia. The absence of democratic processes in forming power opened the door to the establishment of a more centralized and authoritarian system of governance in Russia, weakening democratic institutions and limiting the opportunities for political opposition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdolf Hitler's rise to power\n\n\n== References ==",

After she was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of being involved in the death of her 82-year-old husband, she confessed to killing 10 other people in 20 years. The arrest and identification of the accused happened by the special homicide investigator of the Mahmudabad Prosecutor's Office. When she was arrested, she introduced herself to the camera and she resided in Sari.\nHowever, investigations show that Akbari had 18 concubine husbands and 19 official marriages in these years, all of whom died, and the number of her victims is likely to be more than 11. In total, it has been suggested that she killed more than 20 men. If convicted, she could be considered the second Iranian serial killer after Mahin Qadiri.\n\n\n== Modus operandi ==\nAkbari used to talk about her life and that she wants to marry an elderly man who lives alone. In this way, she met people who were looking for a companion for their elderly and lonely father. After making sure that the intended subject has a lot of wealth, Kulthum would marry her on the condition of receiving a dowry in the form of cash or property, and in less than 3 months, she would kill the person by means of drugs and suffocation. She would dissolve sugar or blood pressure pills in various drinks and give them to the victim. At first, when the victim's condition worsened, Akbari took him to the hospital and apparently saved him. But in the later stages, by increasing the dose of the drug, she made them unconscious and killed them, and because they had a previous history, no one suspected how they died.\nAkbari committed her murders in the cities of Sari, Neka, Mahmudabad, Babol and Qaem Shahr. She used to choose her victims from different cities so as not to leave a trace of herself.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antje Leendertse (born March 7, 1963) is a German diplomat. She has been Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations since September 2021. She was Political Director at the Federal Foreign Office from April 2018 to February 2019, then State Secretary at the Federal Foreign Office under Minister Heiko Maas until mid-2021.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLeendertse began her preparatory service for the higher foreign service in 1990 and joined the Federal Foreign Office after completing it in 1992. After working in the Department for Mediterranean Countries in the Political Division of the Federal Foreign Office, she worked at the Embassy in Russia from 1993 to 1997 and in the United Nations Policy Division at the Federal Foreign Office from 1997 to 1999. She then worked in the Press Division of the Federal Foreign Office from 1999 to 2005, where she was deputy spokesperson from 2002 to 2005. After a subsequent posting at the Embassy in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2006 and a year's parental leave, she served as Permanent Representative of the Ambassador to Finland from 2007 to 2009.\nAfter her return, she was Head of Division for the Western Balkans at the Federal Foreign Office from 2009 to 2012 and then Commissioner for Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia at the Federal Foreign Office from 2012 to March 2014. From March 2014 to March 2015, Leendertse was Federal Government Commissioner for Disarmament and Arms Control at the Federal Foreign Office. She was then Deputy to the Special Representative of the Federal Government for the OSCE Chairmanship Gernot Erler and Head of the OSCE Chairmanship Task Force 2016. From February 2017 to April 2018, Leendertse was Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas appointed Leendertse as the new Political Director at the Federal Foreign Office in April 2018. She succeeded Andreas Michaelis, who was promoted to State Secretary. Just under a year later, she was appointed Permanent State Secretary, succeeding Walter Johannes Lindner, who became Ambassador to India, on March 22, 2019.\nIn the summer of 2021, Leendertse was criticized for dismissing and downplaying urgent warnings from the German embassy in Afghanistan that Kabul would soon fall as the Taliban advanced, supposedly in the (ultimately futile) hope of delaying the fall of the city until after the 2021 federal election.\nLeendertse has been Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations in New York City since September 2021.\n\n\n== Positions ==\nLeendertse is a member of the International Gender Champions, which promotes gender equality in national and international organizations.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Lebenslauf\".

She was the daughter of Prince Constantin Văcărescu and Safta Kretzulescu. She came from the Văcărescu family, an important family of Moldavia originally from Northern Epirus. \nShe became a second wife of the ruler of Moldavia Constantine Ypsilantis. Together they had 7 children, the first of whom were the fighters and filikoi Alexandros, Dimitrios and Nikolaos:\n\nAikaterini 1791-1835\nAlexandros 1792-1828, leader of Filiki Eteria\nDimitrios 1793-1832, member of Filiki Eteria\nNikolaos 1796-1833, leader of the Sacred Band\nGeorgios 1801-1829\nGrigorios 1805-1835\nMaria 1798/1802-1846, wife of A. Schina\nElisavet was called the \"First Lady of Filikoi\", as during the years of preparation for the Greek Revolution of 1821, she was the person who organized the preliminary meetings of personalities of the time in her salons, under the guise of literary meetings, which eventually led to the establishment of Filiki Eteria, of which she herself was probably one of the first female members.\nIt is said that in the house of this particular family, in the presence of Elisavet, the filikoi gathered in February 1821 to decide on the start of the revolution and to prepare the relevant declaration.  \nAfter the death of her husband in 1816 and the confiscation of the property of the Ypsilantis family by the Sultan, Elisavet was one of the main sponsors of the Greek Revolution, for which she offered the rest of her property. The result was that she fell into great poverty. Despite all the privations, however, she continued to support the vision of national liberation in every way.\nShe died in Odesa on 2 October 1866.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ichthyotitan (meaning \"giant fish lizard\") is an extinct genus of probable shastasaurid ichthyosaur from the Late Triassic (late Rhaetian) Westbury Mudstone Formation of Somerset, United Kingdom. The genus contains a single species, I. severnensis, known from two surangular (part of the jaw) bones. It may have had a body length near 25 metres (82 ft), which would make it the largest marine reptile currently known.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe first specimen that would later be referred as Ichthyotitan, BRSMG Cg2488 (the \"Lilstock specimen\"), was found in 2016. It consists of a partial left surangular measuring 96 centimeters (3.15 ft) long. In 2018, Dean Lomax, de la Salle, Judy Massare, and Ramues Gallois identified the Lilstock specimen as belonging to a shastasaurid. \nThe Ichthyotitan holotype specimen, BRSMG Cg3178, was discovered in sediments of the Westbury Formation near Blue Anchor in Somerset, UK. The first fragment was found in 2020, with subsequent expeditions until 2022 revealing additional pieces. The specimen consists of fragments of a right surangular. Histological features suggest that the specimen was still growing, so was either a subadult or a young adult.\nIn 2024, Lomax et al. described Ichthyotitan severnensis as a new genus and species of probable shastasaurid ichthyosaur based on BRSMG Cg3178 and BRSMG Cg2488. The generic name, Ichthyotitan, combines a reference to Ichthyosaurus—whose name means \"fish lizard\", combing the Greek words \"ichthys\", meaning \"fish\", and \"sauros\", meaning \"lizard\"—with the Greek suffix \"-titan\", meaning \"giant\". The specific name, severnensis, references the Severn Estuary near the type locality.\nOther fragmentary remains of giant ichthyosaurs of a similar age to Ichthyotitan have also been reported from Germany (Bonenburg) and France (Autun).\n\n\n== Description ==\nWhile its incompleteness made the size of the animal difficult to determine, it was clearly very large. Using Shastasaurus sikanniensis as a model, the researchers estimated the ichthyosaur to have been around 26 meters (85 ft) long, nearly the size of a blue whale. Scaling based on Besanosaurus, however, found a shorter length estimate of 22 meters (72 ft). The 2024 study describing Ichthyotitan provided a similar revised length estimate of 25 metres (82 ft), making it one of—if not the—largest marine reptiles ever described.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St. Christopher Church is the Protestant-Lutheran parish church located in the village of Reinhausen in the district of Göttingen, Lower Saxony. The church stands on the sandstone rock of the Kirchberg above the village center. It was originally built as a castle chapel by the Counts of Reinhausen in the 10th century and later served as a church for the collegiate monastery and the Benedictine monastery of Reinhausen that emerged from it in the 12th century. The church in Reinhausen, commonly known as the Reinhausen monastery church, has served as the parish church of the village of Reinhausen for many years. Following the introduction of the Reformation in 1542, the monastery was gradually dissolved, and the church was then solely used as a parish church, with brief interruptions. Today, it belongs to the Göttingen church district in the Hildesheim-Göttingen branch of the Hanoverian regional church.\n\nDespite significant structural changes in the Gothic and Baroque styles, the overall appearance of the Romanesque monastery church remains prominent. This is especially evident in the west facade with its double tower. The building type underwent several construction phases, transforming from a Romanesque basilica to a hall church. The interior of the church contains several late medieval works of art, such as two late Gothic altars, extensive remains of wall paintings, and stone sculptures depicting St. Christopher, the patron saint of the church.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe monastery church is situated at an altitude of approximately 210 meters above sea level on the Kirchberg. It is located about 30 meters north of a cliff edge that drops steeply down to the valley of the Wendebach stream and the village center of Reinhausen, which is situated in the valley to the southeast of the church. The church's location on a spur of the Knüll, which extends to the west and rises steeply above the village, makes it highly exposed. In contrast to the village center, the location is visible from the adjacent hills to the west and even from the western slope of the Leinetal valley.\n\nAccess to the church from the village was only possible on foot via three steps carved into the rock until the early 19th century. The road leading from the village to the church hill was built during this time. The steps are now very worn out. Carts could only access the church from the north-east via State ownership.\nThe church is oriented at an angle of approximately 23 degrees to the north, but its truthfulness is not relevant to this description. The west wing of the church faces west-southwest and borders a paved parking lot where the current access road ends. The terrain slopes significantly to this side. To the west of the church, there is a former school and the village kindergarten located on a spur of the Kirchberg. The churchyard is enclosed, with the south and east sides bordering it, while the north side is not accessible to the public. It is adjacent to the former monastery grounds, which now house the Reinhausen forestry office in the former office building, separated from the churchyard by a sandstone wall. Unfortunately, the intermediate building that connected the west front of the church with the Amtshaus was destroyed by fire in 1955, leaving only the outer walls of the two massive basement levels. The Reinhausen estate is located to the northeast of the cemetery.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Castle of the Counts of Reinhausen ===\n\nThe Reinhausen Kirchberg's oldest archaeological evidence of human activity is a fragment of a stone axe from the Neolithic period. However, continuous settlement was not evident until the early Middle Ages. Beginning in the 9th century, the Counts of Reinhausen had a castle complex on the spur of the mountain above the village of Kirchberg, which was naturally protected by rockfalls towards the valley. Numerous archaeological discoveries from the vicinity of the monastery church have been dated to the 9th and 10th centuries. During the 10th and 11th centuries, the Counts of Reinhausen held the office of Count of Leinegau and were therefore of supra-regional importance. Their ancestral castle in Reinhausen was accordingly sizable. The residential area with the church in the west covered approximately 1.5 hectares, while the adjoining farmyard to the northeast covered an additional hectare. The current location of the church, churchyard, and adjoining areas were included. Since 1980, smaller areas of the castle grounds have undergone archaeological investigation through several individual excavations and surveys. A double-shell fortification wall, up to 3.30 meters thick, was discovered along a nine-meter stretch at the edge of the spur. The wall was demolished in the 12th century, as evidenced by small finds from the High Middle Ages in the building remains and demolition debris. Towards the gently rising slope, the fortification comprised two section ditches and a three-meter-thick mortared wall. Reconstructing the interior of the castle is challenging due to the site being built over by the monastery in the High Middle Ages. Excavations inside the monastery church revealed remains of the castle church of the Counts of Reinhausen. However, the exact structural design of the castle church remains unknown.\n\n\n=== Collegiate church ===\nAt the end of the 11th century, the Counts Konrad, Heinrich, and Hermann von Reinhausen and their sister Mathilde converted their ancestral castle into a monastery. However, the dating of the conversion to a monastery to the year 1079 in older literature is contradicted by more recent research. Instead, based on possible dates of death of one of the founders, Count Konrad von Reinhausen, the years 1089 or 1086 are assumed as the latest date of foundation. According to the historical building research by Ulfrid Müller in the years 1963-1967, it is considered certain that the building substance of the private church was used for its church after the castle was converted into a collegiate church and later into a monastery. This is indicated, among other things, by the design of the southern choir wall. Thus, the layout of the castle church in the Ottonian period can be seen as the basic concept of the later collegiate church. The southern wall of the choir, with a still recognizable added arched window, its northern wall, the choir arch with imposts emphasizing the lower base of the arch, and the lower parts of the pillars in the nave are considered to be the remains of the castle church. Ulfrid Müller assumed that the original church had a west portal, on the site of which the present tower front was later built. Compared to other castle chapels in the region, the church is unusually large, reflecting the regional supremacy of the Counts of Reinhausen in the 10th and 11th centuries.\nThe monastery church of Reinhausen thus goes back to a proprietary church in the noble castle of the Counts of Reinhausen, which has been archaeologically documented at this location since the 10th century.  Accordingly, the construction history of the church can be dated back to the 10th century. Despite the lack of written evidence from the early period, it is almost certain that the church has a history of over a thousand years. Müller's research initially suggested that the castle church was built in the 11th century.\n\n\n=== Monastery church ===\nLike the pre-monastic history, the early history of Reinhausen Monastery is mainly known from a report written by Reinhausen's first monk, Reinhard, between 1152 and 1156. The transformation from a monastery to a convent was probably a process that took several decades. The consecration of the monastery church is dated between 1107 and 1115 and was performed by Bishop Reinhard of Halberstadt. Reinhausen belonged to the archbishopric of Mainz, so the consecration of the church was the responsibility of the archbishop of Mainz. Since the archbishopric of Mainz was vacant after the death of Bishop Ruthard and before the consecration of Adalbert, an external, neighboring bishop was commissioned to perform the consecration. Count Hermann of Winzenburg, the initiator of the foundation of the monastery, had hoped for a generous donation from Bishop Reinhard, but this was not granted. In the Lower Saxony Monastery Book, the probable date of the consecration is assumed to be December 3, 1111. The information about the consecration of the monastery most likely refers to the consecration of the monastery church, since the appointment of an abbot took place in 1116 at the earliest.\n\nThe appearance of the monastery church can be roughly reconstructed for the first half of the 12th century. Ulfrid Müller and Klaus Grote, based on the results of their architectural research, assume that this form of the castle and collegiate church can also be assumed for the original building of the monastery church, i.e. that major alterations took place only after the monastery had already existed for some time. Although the church was unusually large for a castle chapel, it was and is very small compared to other Romanesque monastery churches. There is almost no evidence of architectural ornamentation in the building fabric from the oldest monastic period, and the church was not vaulted - unlike the church of Lippoldsberg Monastery, which was an architectural pioneer in the region and was built in the mid-12th century. This suggests that the church was built much earlier. Parts of this first monastery church have been preserved in the north and south walls of the chancel, possibly in the chancel arch including the crossbeams, in the eastern pair of pillars, and in the lower half of the two western pillars that stand in the central nave of the present church. According to reconstructions, the church was a pillar basilica with a cruciform floor plan. It had a transept that extended north and south beyond today's outer walls and a central nave that was raised above the aisles and lit by clerestories above the aisles. The transept, with its strong architectural crossing, could have been built in the same way as the front part of the nave, which corresponds to it today, but the floor level was raised by three steps compared to the nave so that the floor level of the nave was correspondingly lower.  The aisles were separated from the transept by a wall - probably with an opening - the foundations of which were found on the south side of the church. According to the foundation finds, the eastern pillars of the central nave originally had a cruciform floor plan. There is no information about the design of the western front of the first monastery church, such as a tower or a westwork; the present Romanesque western building is more recent. However, according to the report of the first Abbot Reinhard on the history of the Reinhausen monastery, the monastery was moved from the south side to the north side and extended due to lack of space, contrary to the plan of the monastery. This information may refer to the monastery church, as there is only about 10 meters of space south of the church to the cliff. During its time as a monastery church, several alterations were made, chapels were built and added, and altars were donated.\n\tConstruction phase reconstruction according to Ulfrid Müller\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Romanesque west façade with its two towers, which is the most distinctive feature of the exterior, was built around 1170. The mid-12th-century alterations were probably influenced by Abbess Eilika von Ringelheim, who came from the family of the Counts of Reinhausen and spent several months a year at her former ancestral seat in Reinhausen Abbey. The steep slope of the terrain did not allow for a portal in the west façade, so the entrance for visitors not coming from the monastery was moved to its present location in an intermediate bay on the south side to the east of the tower. The entrance from the monastery area was on the opposite side of the north wall. Opinions differ as to whether a gallery was already built into the central building when the west transept was constructed: Ulfrid Müller suggests that a gallery was almost certainly present since it could have served as a gallery for the Abbess and Countess Eilika, allowing her to attend services in the monks' church in the manner of a nun's gallery. Furthermore, there is a connection between the later wall paintings and the northern access to the gallery from the upper floor of the monastery building. Tobias Ulbrich does not necessarily see these references and disputes the compelling dating of a gallery system to the time before 1400. In addition to the clerestory windows, the nave was lit by two large arched windows in the west transept, which were later altered and reconstructed in 1893.\nThe clear protrusion of the side aisle foundation on the inside leads to the assumption that the side aisles were widened slightly in the second half of the 12th century. Based on the walled-up arched windows and the interior paintings, it can be determined that they were three-quarters as high as they are today.  The new walls of the side aisles were constructed with greater thickness. Their thickness, similar to that of the west transept, is approximately 1.30 meters, while the older walls are only approximately 90 centimeters thick. Ulfrid Müller also postulates that the central nave was significantly elevated during this construction phase, yet this theory is contested by others. The separated crossing remained unaltered during the late Romanesque construction phase.\nA renewed economic upswing at the monastery between 1245 and 1309 brought with it new construction work on the monastery church. In a Mainz indulgence document of 1290, Archbishop Gerhard II of Mainz granted a forty-day indulgence to anyone who contributed to the construction of the Reinhausen church.  At the end of the 13th century, the northern and southern bays of the west transept and the two adjoining intermediate bays were given a simple groined vault, the belt arches of the lower tower floors were redesigned as pointed arches, as were the arches on the east side of the first upper floor in the tower. The main entrance on the south side lost the tympanum that had originally filled the vaulted field of the round-arched portal and received a pointed arch doorway. On the south side, west of the transept, a second portal, now closed, was broken in.\n\nDuring the same construction period, a chapel of Saint Maurice with three Gothic lancet windows was built above the entrance on the south side of the church. The chapel of St. Maurice extended over two bays and the wall of the side aisle was raised for the chapel at this point.Access was through the gallery. Due to the size of the chapel room, the east wall was not on the axis of the existing pillar, but one meter east of it. The wall on the first floor was supported by a wall directly below it, creating a separate entrance hall under the chapel. The altar of St. Maurice's Chapel had its brick foundation, visible as a column in the northeastern corner of the vaulted entrance hall. The altar, and thus the chapel, was first documented in 1415 on the occasion of the establishment of a mass for the souls. According to the Göttingen chronicler Franciscus Lubecus, another chapel was built by Abbot Gunter von Roringen before he died in 1300 as a burial place for the abbots of Reinhausen monastery. This dating is questionable because Gunter was still abbot of the monastery in 1382 and 1385.\nDuring the renovation works in 1965, the beginnings of a rib vault were found to the north of the choir, in the area of the sacristy built there. It belonged to a Gothic side chapel with a 3/8 end. There was a narrow corridor between the northern arm of the transept and the chapel, which provided direct access to the choir from the monastery building. The remains of the chapel are related to the chapel to the north of the choir, which was mentioned in a document in 1394 and served as the burial place of the Lords of Uslar. It is also called St. John's Chapel because tradition mentions it as the site of an altar dedicated to St. John the Evangelist: A new altar in the ambulatory is mentioned in writing in 1360, a burial place for the knight Ernst of Uslar in front of the altar of St. John the Evangelist in 1378, and a donation by the four sons of Ernst of Uslar for the altar of St. John in the new chapel in the ambulatory in 1399. The Uslar burial chapel is still listed in the inventory of 1707.  Older literature dates the chapel to 1322. The dating is based on two damaged keystones of a ribbed vault with inscriptions that were found in the area in the 19th century and attributed to this chapel. They are now kept in the Maurice Chapel.  The recent deciphering of the inscriptions \"•an(n)o•1•5•22•d(omi)n(u)s•m[at]hias• […]\" and \"frater•reÿnerus•prior•\", which differs from the earlier reading, argues against this early dating of the keystones. The attribution of these keystones to the burial chapel of the Lords of Uslar is therefore no longer probable, and the dating of this chapel to 1322 is no longer valid.\n\nAccording to recent findings, the passage from the northern bay of the church to the southwestern corner of the adjacent cloister was walled up from the inside already in the Middle Ages. On the outside, a niche was created, the lower part of which was later also walled up. Four Gothic tracery tiles were found under a layer of humus during drainage works in 1993. Neither in the adjacent area of the cloister nor in the area of the door threshold under the medieval wall was there any continuation of the tiling or any evidence of it. Hildegard Krösche thinks that these tiles belong to the chapel north of the choir.\nFrom the beginning of the 14th century until the dissolution of the monastery in 1574, construction work was mainly devoted to the decoration of the church and its chapels. Between 1387 and 1442, the interior walls were decorated with murals, at least in the entrance hall, on the side walls of the gallery, and in the southern aisle. After the Reinhausen monastery joined the Bursfelde Congregation in 1446, more late Gothic furnishings were donated. The last written donation specifically for the construction of the church and monastery was made by the Lords of Uslar in 1451. In 1498 and 1507 a late Gothic carved altar was donated, large parts of which are still preserved today. According to a recent reading of the inscriptions on the two keystones in the Maurice Chapel, it is likely that a major expansion or rebuilding of the monastery took place in 1522, and that a vault was added to one of the buildings. This could also be indicated by the inscription on a stone, now lost, which was set into the cemetery wall as a spolia in the 19th century: \"M.ccccc.xxii. / S.georivs ora pro nobis.\" (\"1522 / St. George (?), pray for us.\")\n\n\n=== Since the Reformation ===\nEven before the Reformation, the monastery was already in a downward economic and personnel trend, which was accelerated by the introduction of the Reformation in 1542 and the establishment of a manor house on the monastery grounds. 20 years after the introduction of the Lutheran monastic order, the inventory of the monastery and the church was listed because the monastery was to be handed over to Ludolf Fischer, who was appointed bailiff. The last monk of the old monastery died in Reinhausen in 1564.\n\nThe further reconstruction of the church building after the dissolution of the monastery can be seen only in the first pictorial representation on an engraving by Matthäus Merian, published in 1654 in the Topographia Germaniae. At that time, the basilica form was no longer recognizable from the outside. The transept was combined with the transept, choir and nave under a gabled roof. The towers were crowned with high pointed spires and there was also a ridge turret on the choir. This is confirmed by an inventory of the monastery from 1707, which mentions a bell above the choir.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the cruciform floor plan was abandoned by demolishing the transept walls and building the side aisle walls in a continuous line. The east wall of the choir was rebuilt with old stones and received a large Baroque window, and large Baroque window openings were also made in the side aisle walls. The western facade also received a Baroque window. A shortening of the church reported by Mithoff in 1861, which is said to have taken place 150 years earlier, will refer to these measures. The basilica was fundamentally transformed into a hall church by installing a lower ceiling over all the naves.\nIn the years 1885-1887, extensive renovations were carried out, during which the connecting floor between the towers was reconstructed. The western gallery was also rebuilt, the dormers were removed, and the roof was constructed without the previous cornice. In addition, after the removal of the Baroque pulpit-altar wall, the church received a winged altar made of the remains of the medieval altar of the Virgin Mary and supplemented with new parts, which have served as the main altar ever since. To protect the walls of the choir from moisture, a second wall was built in front of the lower part of the walls. Another fundamental restoration of the church interior took place between 1963 and 1967 when a sacristy and a boiler room were added to the north of the choir. During the reconstruction and renovation of the church, archaeological excavations were carried out between 1965 and 1968, and the existing structure of the church was precisely measured and examined by Ulfrid Müller. Since the building history research began long after the reconstruction work began, no further excavations could be carried out in the western part of the church. Therefore, it was not possible to obtain information about a possible tower or a differently designed western end of the original church building. The façade of the tower was renovated in 1990/1991.In February 2011, the Church Building Society St. Christopher Reinhausen Association was founded to raise funds for the maintenance and renovation of the church.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== External construction ===\n\nThe appearance of the monastery church is dominated by the monumental Romanesque double-tower façade on the west side. Built of locally quarried buntsandstein blocks of low strength, it is divided, apart from narrow window openings that hardly disturb the unity of the overall impression, only by a very narrow, simple cornice at the base. The total width of the west building is 16.30 meters. The towers end with low-hip roofs with transverse ridges, giving them a somewhat squat appearance, especially when viewed from a distance. The roof of the south tower is slightly lower than that of the north tower. Under the roofs, the sound openings are arranged as mullions whose Romanesque dividing columns have cube capitals and attic bases. The masonry of the towers rises 5.50 meters above that of the central wing, between them lies the sloping roof of the nave roof, which slopes down to the west. The 5.75-meter-high upper story is divided into two stories below the towers, which are lit at the top by a slightly wider arched window with a central pillar and a single narrow arched window below. Only the upper story between the towers, which was reconstructed during a major renovation at the end of the 19th century, has two significantly larger arched windows. On the first floor of the west façade, there are another four arched windows, each 45 centimeters wide and 1.40 meters high. A door is broken into the base of the south tower under the southern of these windows.\nThe simple basic form of today's appearance over a longitudinal rectangular floor plan looks like that of an aisleless church or simple hall church. With a length of 28.60 meters, excluding the choir, the church is significantly smaller than other monastery churches in the region. The entire building is unplastered on the outside. The simple gable roof with a continuous ridge and the hip roof over the tower connecting floor and over the choir emphasize the simplicity of the building's form.\n\nThe Romanesque main portal on the south side, just behind the western transom, is particularly striking, projecting slightly from the building line; the projecting wall section is slightly rectangular, finished and emphasized at the top by a simple cornice, the portal is not in the middle, but clearly offset to the left. The sandstone ashlar masonry next to the protruding portal zone is attached to the masonry of the tower without a building seam. The round-arched portal itself is characterized by several stepped jambs and laterally placed columns with cube capitals and an attic base; the transition from the lateral portal jambs to the high arched field above the portal is designed as a profiled impost zone. The innermost jamb, on the other hand, has a smooth transition from the transom zone and a slightly pointed arch. The Gothic lancet windows, which belong to the Maurice Chapel above the entrance hall, are arranged in close proximity at a slight distance above the portal. The outer wall area of the chapel is constructed from coarsely hewn sandstone blocks, with only large-format and carefully smoothed stones present on the originally exposed eastern edge. The larger stones of the Maurice Chapel exhibit pincer holes, in contrast to the ashlars on the older west transom and in the portal zone. On the north side of the church, opposite the Moritz Chapel and portal zone, one wall area has a mixed masonry structure. Only the upper part of a walled arched door, measuring 82 centimetres in width, is still visible. This originally provided a direct passageway between the church and the cloister. Another, now walled-up arched door on the north side led from the upper floor of the cloister to the second floor of the tower.\n\nTo the east of the portal zone, the south wall of the nave is predominantly of roughly hewn sandstone, with the eastern section, about 7.50 meters wide, bounded by a building seam and where the transept was located until the beginning of the 18th century, having an even more irregular stone setting and less surface treatment. In the southeastern corner of the nave, the usual careful corner ashlar work is missing because the former transept was demolished at this point. The three baroque arched windows are approximately 2 meters wide and 3.35 meters high. They are framed by simple but carefully carved stone surrounds of red and light sandstone, with the lintels and keystones projecting slightly from the rest of the jambs. The window openings on the south wall correspond to the opposite ones on the north wall, although the eastern window has been reduced in height in favor of a door to the former monastery courtyard below. Between the western and the central window of the south wall, the strongly chamfered jambs of a much smaller, simple arched window from the Romanesque period, which was later walled up, are clearly visible. This former window also corresponds to a bricked-up window of the same size in the northern wall of the church. On the left, below the central window of the southern wall of the nave, the jambs of a small ogival door, also walled up, can be seen; the only decorative feature is a simple chamfer on the edge of the jamb. The east wall of the south aisle and the side walls of the choir are now windowless. There is only a wooden hatch above the edge of the side aisle roof.\n\nThe recessed eastern choir, 6.40 meters deep and 7.30 meters wide, with a straight end, has small, regular layered stone wall on the south wall, which differs from the less regular layered masonry on the east end of the aisles and on the east wall of the choir. A small Romanesque window, now closed, can also be seen in the south wall of the choir. The masonry of the northern choir wall above the later extension is similar to that of the southern wall. These choir side walls date from the time of the church's construction. Wide, unadorned buttresses are attached to the outside corners of the choir. The fact that this is a later addition can be seen in the seam between the wall and the choir and in the ashlars that run through the wall. In the Baroque eastern choir wall, as well as in the eastern end of the aisles, which were altered at the same time, there are reused stones from older construction phases. They can be recognized by their profiling or pincer holes and were reworked with a pointed chisel for reuse. A Baroque window in the middle of the eastern wall of the choir corresponds in its design to the windows of the side aisles. On the north side of the choir, there is a low extension built in 1965 during the renovation of the church for the heating system and the sacristy. Its walls are also faced with sandstone. To the east of the sanctuary, a retaining wall was built to prevent the ground from rising to the east and north of the sanctuary, creating a trench towards the sanctuary. In the area of the heating extension, this trench is about 1.80 meters deep, so that only the roof of the extension is visible from the cemetery. To the north of the extension is an old sandstone wall that shows the consoles of a former cross-ribbed vault and the lower bases of the ribs facing the pit. Above the extension, the wall separates the church property from that of the Forest Service. The eastern extension of the wall, built later, forms the retaining wall of the cemetery.\nThe north side of the church abuts the neighboring property and is not visible to visitors. After a fire in April 1955, only the west wall of a former forestry office building attached to the north side of the west wall of the church remains, aligned with the lower west wall of the church.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe interior of the church is divided into a western and an eastern section. The entrance is through a small hall with a painted ogival vault in the south of the western part of the building. From there, a door leads to the west to the south tower and the staircase to the upper floors, to the north to the community room, and to the east to the actual interior of the church, which is three steps higher.\n\nThe main eastern section of St. Christopher's is a brightly plastered, three-aisled hall with a flat, unadorned wooden ceiling. The interior is 7.10 meters high and the central nave is 5.50 meters wide. The side aisles are each 3.50 meters wide, although the north aisle narrows to 2.70 meters due to the considerably thicker wall of the north wall in the central area. The aisles are separated from the central nave by two rectangular piers, each of which supports round-arched arches above narrow arcades that are wide in relation to the dimensions of the church interior. The span of each of the three bays is just over five meters. The pillars stand on the floor without bases. The two eastern pillars - originally the crossing pillars at the western beginning of the transept - each have a base area of 87 centimeters wide and 1.60 meters long, and a much more elongated cross-section than the western pair of pillars, which are the same width but only one meter long. The transition from the piers to the arches is accentuated by profiled transom plates with circumferential corrugations and fillets, which are further accentuated by a color scheme that matches the red sandstone against the white plaster. The large Baroque windows in the side aisles and the choir are glazed with small clear panes between wooden mullions. The internal jambs of the window niches end with segmental arches and are slightly sloped, while the window sills are strongly sloped. The added door and window jambs from earlier phases of construction, visible on the exterior, are not visible on the interior; on the south wall, this is indicated only by the absence of the interior mural painting. The upper end of this mural also indicates the former height of the aisles. The interior has a Baroque character due to the large arched windows, but the basic Romanesque structure is still fully expressed. The eastern part of the central nave and the side aisles in front of the eastern pillars are one step higher than the seating area of the nave and are therefore at the same level as the choir. There are the pulpit and the lectern.\nLike the nave, the east choir, which is simply plastered in a light color, is separated from the central nave by a round arch that rests on wall supports at the corners of the choir. With a width of 5.50 meters and a length of 5.50 meters, it is almost square in plan, but slightly lower than the main body of the nave due to its elevated position by one step. The back of the altar table, with the winged altar in the center of the choir arch, is illuminated by the large Baroque window in the east wall of the choir.\n\nThe western part of the church, with the basements of both towers, the eastern intermediate bays and the western extension of the central nave up to the second pair of piers, is separated from the main space of the church. To the north of the Gothic entrance hall, this separation consists of a wall that was added later. The area separated in the western part is used as a parish hall and winter church. The area visually separated from the outside in the southern view, namely the towers and the adjoining intermediate bay with the portal zone and the Maurice chapel, is also recognizable in the interior layout. The western extension of the central nave has a flat-beamed ceiling. The northern part, i.e. the extension of the northern aisle to the west, is connected to the chancel by two pointed arches running along the length of the church. The arches, the adjoining two-bay groined vault to the north and the corner of the north tower are supported by a square pillar one meter thick. The first floor of the north tower, with the adjoining intermediate bay, thus forms an optically separate part of the community room, in which a kitchenette is installed. Corresponding columns on the south side of the presbytery and the bricked arches between them indicate a similar construction method. However, while the eastern vault on the south side of the entrance hall has been preserved, the western vault in the south tower has been removed. In 1966, a staircase was installed there, with a toilet room below. The other two supports of the belt arches are a pillar in the extension of the partition wall between the parish hall and the nave, which originally separated the side and main naves of the church, and the western outer wall.\nThe upper floor above the chancel is open to the interior of the church as a gallery. The organ is located in the central nave, the northern part of which is accessible from the central gallery through an arched doorway. South of the gallery, next to the tower, is the former Maurice Chapel with three lancet windows placed side by side. Up to the level of the window sill, the outer wall of the room is considerably thicker than above. The resulting wall ledge, 58 centimeters deep, is covered with sandstone slabs and still has a piscina on the right side. In the northeastern corner of the Maurice Chapel, a wall pillar, which runs vertically across the entire height of the room in the entrance hall and is decorated with mural paintings, breaks off irregularly above the floor. The interlocking with the walls indicates that it once supported the altar, the top of which was one meter above the floor. The Maurice Chapel contains the weathered central columns of the vaulted sound openings of the towers, which had to be replaced with new ones. There are also two keystones from a ribbed vault, dated 1522 by their inscription. The Maurice Chapel forms the passage to the gallery and contains a wooden staircase as an access to the south tower, the shaft of which is empty. In the north tower, a ladder leads to the belfry.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Murals ===\n\nIn several places in the interior of the church, there are large remnants of colored murals on the plaster. These paintings date back to the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries. All the murals were restored during a renovation project in 1965-1967.\n\n\n==== Entrance hall ====\nThe murals in the vestibule at the southern main entrance to the monastery church were uncovered in 1909/1910. The vault of the vestibule is decorated with floral ornaments in which four medallions, each with a half-figure, are embedded. The figures may represent the four Fathers of the Church, but the attribution is not certain. Mary under the cross and St. Christopher with the Christ Child on his shoulders are depicted on the walls of the entrance hall. The text of a banner in the image of St. Christopher is difficult to read. Another figure can be seen on the edge of the vault near the entrance to the south aisle. A three-line banner, also difficult to read, is painted on the pointed arch above this entrance.\n\n\n==== Main room ====\n\nOther murals can be found in the south aisle of the church. Some of the murals are only partially preserved. They depict scenes from the legend of Christopher according to the Legenda aurea, in particular his martyrdom in Lycia at the command of King Dagnus: above the entrance on the west wall of the south aisle is a depiction of the pagan King Dagnus falling from his throne at the sight of Christopher, with the scourging of Christopher on the right. Below this are fragments of male figures on the left and male and female figures on the right. The white background of the paintings is decorated with red flowers, in the scourging scene with red stars. Above the upper left image, a two-line banner describes the scene, which is no longer fully legible. The scenes on the south wall of the side aisle depict St. Christopher and the Christ Child on the riverbank at the top right, St. Christopher preaching at the top left, and St. Christopher praying at the bottom right. To the left of St. Christopher in the prayer scene are King Dagnus and another person; the explanatory banner can only be partially deciphered. At the bottom left, King Dagnus is depicted seated on his throne, with arrows floating in the air, which the king had shot at St. Christopher. This scene also features a banner that is only partially legible. Once again, the backgrounds are decorated with red flowers and stars. There are fragments of further paintings on the left towards the eastern part of the south wall. Some of the wall paintings were destroyed by subsequent alterations, particularly the installation of the large Baroque windows and the removal of the transept. The upper wall area of the side aisle walls is not painted; it was subsequently bricked up when the church was given a uniform gable roof and the basilical elevation was abandoned.\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\nThe side walls of the gallery depict scenes relating to stories from the New Testament and the Last Judgment. On the south side, the Resurrection and the archangel Michael as the Weeper of Souls are depicted, while on the north side, Jesus and the sleeping disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane are shown, as well as the Hell's Dragon. These murals were only uncovered during the restoration in 1963-1967.\n\n\n=== Altar ===\n\nThe winged altar, which has served as the main altar since the end of the 19th century, is composed of a central shrine with carved figures against a golden background and two hinged wings painted on both sides. Both the paintings on the wing panels and the lines of text on the front and back indicate that it was originally a Marian altar. During a restoration in 1885-1887, it was redesigned as a crucifixion altarpiece. The inscription on the altar wings indicates that the altar was consecrated in 1498. The altar was consecrated by Johannes, the titular bishop of Sidon and vicar general of Archbishop Berthold of Mainz. There is no written record of the donor or donors of the altar. The newly consecrated panel with carved and painted images of the Virgin Mary is mentioned in a certificate of indulgence from 1499.\nPrior to the restoration, the wings and the outer parts of the central shrine were incorporated separately from the central part into a Baroque altar wall, a practice that continued until the end of the 19th century. This was also the case with the figures of the Judoc shrine. The altar retable stands on a predella decorated with coats of arms and inscriptions above the sandstone ashlar altar table, which is two steps higher than the choir.\nA crucifixion group is the central element in the 1.86-meter-high by 1.78-meter-wide central shrine. Originally, according to the dedication of the altar, there was certainly a representation of the Virgin Mary, probably as a Madonna with a crown of rays or as a group crowning the Virgin Mary. On either side of the central shrine are two figures of saints, one above the other: Mary Magdalene on the lower left, Catherine on the upper left, Barbara on the upper right, and Cyriacus on the lower right. These carved and painted figures are described in most publications as carvings from the workshop of Master Bartold Kastrop. Other authors, however, reject the attribution to Kastrop's workshop, or at least discuss it critically. The figures of the saints, the tracery and the pedestals are similar to those on the Marian retable in the church of St. Martin in Geismar, which can be attributed to Bartold Kastrop on the basis of an inscription. On the other hand, the year in which the Reinhausen altarpiece was created - 1498 - argues against Kastrop as the master carver, since he was naturalized in Göttingen only a year later and until then had a workshop in Northeim, which was much further away. There are also differences in the facial expression and liveliness of the figures compared to Kastrop's Geismar carvings. Antje Middeldorf Kosegarten sees similarities to the figures on the carved altar in St. John's Church in Uslar and to a stone sacrament niche in St. John's Church in Göttingen. Each carved figure is situated on a pedestal with beveled corners at the front, on which it is inscribed in black lettering: \"S(an)c(t)a maria magdalena\", \"S(an)c(t)a katerina ora p(ro nobis)\", \"S(an)c(t)a barbara virgo\" and \"S(an)c(tu)s ciriacus mar(tyr)\". The carved figures of Mary and John under the cross were newly created during the altar's restoration in 1885. While some authors posit that the crucifixion group was also created at that time, others suggest that the figure of the crucified Christ was crafted during the Baroque period, while the cross itself was renewed at a later date. Still others hypothesize that the entire crucifixion group is Baroque in origin. The pedestals of the figures accompanying the cross are significantly taller than those of the older figures. They bridge a painted decorative strip at the lower edge of the altar centerpiece and raise the two figures to the level of the foot of the cross. These pedestals are not beveled and bear the inscriptions \"Sca Maria\" and \"Scs Ioannes\". The design of the letters is based on the older carved figures on the altar.\nThe interior of the 88-centimetre-wide panels each depicts a scene from the life of Mary. The Annunciation is depicted at the top of the left-hand panel, while the visit to Elizabeth is shown on the right-hand panel. The birth of Jesus is depicted at the bottom of the left-hand panel, while the Adoration of the Magi is shown on the right-hand panel. A copperplate engraving by Martin Schongauer served as a model, at least for the last scene. The authorship of the paintings is a matter of contention. According to more recent information, they originate from the same workshop as the backs of the wings, but cannot be attributed with certainty to the master himself. In contrast, older art historians assume an unknown, less advanced painter with no other known works in Lower Saxony. The backgrounds of the paintings are painted in gold, which identifies these pages as festive pages. Additionally, the horizontal strips on the upper and lower edges of the wings and the shrine, as well as in the middle of the wings, which serve to delimit the depictions, are also gold-colored.\n\nThe outer sides of the wings are the working side of the altar and have a red background. The Twelve Apostles are depicted in groups of three, with Matthias the Apostle in place of Judas Iscariot. In addition to their attributes, they are labeled with their names on the top edge and the ledge separating the two rows. Eight figures also have their names on the hem of their robes. The paintings are attributed to an unknown master, who is called the \"Master of the Reinhausen Apostles\" because of this work. Other publications attribute the wing paintings to a student of Hans von Geismar or the Hildesheim Epiphanius Master, or assume that the Master of the Reinhausen Apostles was a direct student of Hans von Geismar. Some of these works were probably based on engravings by Martin Schongauer. On the outside, the lower edge bears the inscription \"Anno dni 1498 pletum est hec tabella / Jn honore gloriose marie virgini\" as the date of production. (In the year of our Lord 1498 this tablet was completed / In honor of the glorious Virgin Mary). The l in \"[com]pletum\" (completed) is missing the ascender; this word has also been interpreted as \"pictum\" (painted).\n\nThe gilded horizontal moldings on the inside of the wings above and below the paintings, and the upper and lower horizontal moldings of the central shrine are embossed with lettering that originally formed a continuous set running across the wings and shrine. During the reconstruction of the central section, the lettering was replaced by a decorative band, so a larger portion is missing. At the top of the altar is the Salve Regina, an antiphon by Hermann von Reichenau:(English: \"Hail, Queen, Mother of Mercy, life, happiness and our hope, hail! To you we call, exiled children of Eve; to you we sigh, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Well then, our intercessor\"), the lower, an antiphon set by Heinrich Isaac:(English: \"Hail, most holy Mary, Mother of God, Queen of Heaven, Gateway to Paradise, Mistress of the world! You are a uniquely pure virgin, you conceived Jesus without sin, you gave birth to the Creator and Redeemer of the world, in whom I have no doubt\"). In the center of the left wing is a verse from the Latin translation of the Song of Songs:(English: \"You are perfectly beautiful, my friend, and there is no blemish on you\"), on the right wing:(English: \"O blooming rose, mother of the Lord\")\nfrom an antiphon by Hermann von Reichenau. Older literature also mentions deviant readings and other errors, especially for the script in places that are difficult to recognize.\nThe predella was made later than the altarpieces. The date of origin ranges from the late 16th century to the Baroque period and the 19th century. It bears two shields with upper coats of arms in intertwined rings in the center, which in some publications are interpreted as arms of alliance. According to the current color scheme, the heraldic right coat of arms shows an upright red lion covered with golden balls in silver, on the red-silver beaded helmet four silver bars crossed at right angles, each with different tips at both ends, helmet covers red-silver. The heraldic left coat of arms shows in silver a red saddled and bridled, jumping black steed, on the silver beaded helmet a red saddled and bridled, jumping black steed in front of five black and silver plumes arranged in a fan shape, helmet covers black and silver. On older photos, showing the state before 1945, the relief of the coat of arms is recognizable without or with different painting. Hans Georg Gmelin suggests that the arms belong to the von Werder and von Pentz families, but is not sure. On both outer sides, next to the coats of arms, the text of the Words of Institution for Holy Communion is written in gold on a black background. These text panels are not yet present in photographs taken before 1945.\n\n\n=== Shrine of St. Judoc ===\n\nOn the east wall of the north aisle is the so-called St. Judoc shrine, the central part of a former winged altarpiece, whose carved figures were integrated into a Baroque pulpit altar wall above the sounding board until the main altar was restored at the end of the 19th century. After the dismantling of the pulpit altar wall and the reconstruction of the main altar, the shrine was placed on the east wall of the south aisle; since the renovations of 1963-1967, it has been placed in the north aisle. The shrine is inscribed with the date 1507 and is considered to be the work of the Epiphanius Master from Hildesheim.\nThree figures - all holding a book - depict St. Judoc as a pilgrim with a scallop shell on his head in the center, St. Bartholomew on the left, and Saint Blaise on the right. The central figure of Judoc is a good head taller than the flanking saints. They all stand on pedestals with inscriptions and have halos behind their heads on a gold background with the inscriptions: \"SANCTVS.BARTHoLOMEVS.\", \"SANCTVS.JODOCVS.\" and \"SACTVS.BLASIVS.\" (sic!). The pedestal inscriptions read \"SANCTVS.BARTOLOMEVS\" on the left and \"SANCTVS.BLASIVS.EPISC\" on the right, although below the central figure is the year \".DVSENT.VNDE.VIF.HVNDERT.SEFVEN.\". (1507). The figure of Judoc also has inscriptions on the hem of his robe, interrupted by creases and folds in the hem of the robe: \"CRISTVS\" on the right arm holding the book, \"MARIE\" under that hand, \"IHESVS\" on the right collar (facing left from the viewer's perspective), \"M\" on the left collar, \"SANCTVS\" on the lower hem of the robe, \"(...)OCVS\" and \"FA\" after a folded section of the hem, and \"MANG\" at the bottom right. All the inscriptions on the Judoc shrine are in early humanist capitals. The inscriptions for the figures mentioned by Hector Wilhelm Heinrich Mithoff as \"S.JACOB.MAJ\" in the center, \"SCS.BLASIVS\" on the right, and \"S.BARTHOLOMEVS\" on the left no longer exist in this form; Tobias Ulbrich thinks it possible that the inscription for James is on the invisible back of the base of the center figure.\nSince Mithoff's description, various authors have identified the eponymous figure in the center of the shrine as James the Great. Ulbrich justifies this interpretation with the inscription mentioned by Mithoff, with the figure's pilgrim insignia including the scallop shell on the headdress, as well as with an alleged second pair of wings on the main altar, which prove a veneration of this saint in Reinhausen through figurative and pictorial representations of the legend of St. James. In the nineteenth century, however, only a single wing was preserved as an additional altar wing alongside the two wings of the main altar, which was owned by Carl Oesterley at the time. It was assigned to a single altar by Mithoff together with the Gothic works of art installed in a pulpit altar wall at the time – the St. Judoc shrine, both wings of the main altar, four carved figures of saints from the shrine of the main altar. This wing painting, which suffered significant deterioration in the 19th century and has since undergone restoration, is currently housed in the Landesmuseum Hannover. It is no longer typically associated with the main altar, but rather with the St. Judoc shrine, and is attributed to the painter Hans Raphon. This altar wing was the outer left wing of the St. Judoc retable, which, according to some published sources, originally comprised two pairs of wings. Both the right wing and an inner pair of wings are missing. However, the scenes depicted on the preserved wing are more clearly recognizable since the restoration, as there are two images arranged one above the other on each side. On the exterior, an image of the apostle James the Great is depicted at the top, accompanied by a staff, book, and the shell on the forehead of his hat. Below this is an image of St. Hubertus, who is shown with a crozier, book, mitre, and a hunting horn under his left hand. Both saints are depicted sitting on rocks, with St. James wearing a long beard. Two scenes from the legend of the St. Judoc are depicted on the inside: in the upper picture, St. Judoc's miracle at the spring, through which he saved Count Heymo, who was out hunting, from death; in the lower picture, the miraculous preservation of his corpse. In the representation of the spring miracle, St. Judoc is depicted as a beardless young man in pilgrim's clothing, his cap lying on the ground and bearing the pilgrim's shell. A single more recent description of the Reinhausen St. Judoc's retable recognizes only this one wing and describes not only the right wing but also the middle section as lost.\n\n\n=== Triumphal cross ===\n\nThe crucifix at the eastern end of the south aisle, which was later reworked, is also late Gothic and is said to have served as a triumphal cross. It is 2.92 meters high and was placed on the lower floor of the west transept in the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Stone sculptures ===\nOn the east wall of the choir there is a semicircular Romanesque stone relief. It depicts a cross on a hemisphere in an arch and below it a lion with a human head that appears to be devouring another human head. The relief probably served as a tympanum in the vaulted area of the church's portal.\nIn the eastern wall of the choir, there are also the remains of a Gothic stone sculpture with a central pinnacle that has a crown carried by two angels instead of a finial. Its original function is interpreted as the crowning of a sacramental niche. It is said to be a much cruder copy of a sacrament niche from St. John's Church in Göttingen.\nOn the southern wall of the choir there is a stone sculpture of St. Christopher on a newer stone base, a relic of the worship of the church's patron saint, which dates back to the Romanesque period. The saint is depicted with the Christ Child on his shoulders and a staff in his hand. Before the renovations in 1963-1967, the sculpture was located in a niche on the eastern wall of the southern aisle, below the shrine of St. Judoc. It is one of the works of art in the church since the 19th century; before that it was located in the monastery courtyard.\n\nOn the north wall of the choir is a detailed sculpture of Christ carrying his cross. The well-preserved stone carving in the central area shows Christ rising from under the cross, a man in front of the cross holding Christ by a rope, and probably Simon of Cyrene standing behind Christ. Only the heads and parts of the upper bodies of three other persons in the background can be seen.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gravestones ===\nThere is a cast iron tombstone on both the north and south walls of the choir. Both date from the second half of the 16th century. The slab on the south wall of the choir was made for the monastery's pledge holder Christoph Wolff von Gudenberg, who died on February 15, 1569, and the one on the north wall was made for Melchior von Uslar and his wife Margarete von Ohle, who died on September 8, 1574. On the east wall of the choir is a painted wooden plaque from 1735 commemorating Maria Magdalena Hinüber, born from Bush. The two cast-iron memorial plaques were placed side by side on the south wall of the choir until after the Second World War; the wooden plaque hung together with another wooden epitaph above the plaques. The second wooden plaque was also in the form of a medallion with side vines and a crown; it commemorated the bailiff Christian Erich Hinüber, who died in 1752 and is also named on the surviving plaque as the husband of the deceased. Another stone gravestone from 1706 for Veit Andreas Hornhardt on the east wall of the north aisle is heavily weathered. Hornhardt was Amtmann of the Reinhausen district from 1680 to 1705.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Baptismal font ===\nThe baptismal font is made of dark-stained wood. The base is four-sided, the basin with the baptismal font is supported by four neo-Romanesque columns and is octagonal. It bears the following inscription: \"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved (Mark. 16:16)\" On the eighth side there is a vine decoration.\n\n\n=== Pulpit ===\nThe slightly raised pulpit to the left of the choir is a modern, very simple piece of furniture, as is the lectern to the right. The baroque pulpit, built into the former altar wall, was removed in 1885-1887. Until the renovation in the 1960s, the pulpit stood on four neo-Romanesque columns on the front freestanding pillar.\n\n\n=== Vasa sacra ===\n\nAn inventory of the church treasury made after the introduction of the Reformation in 1542 listed seven chalices and paten, a pair of which belonged to the hospital, as well as a chalice kept outside. There was also a gilded monstrance. Twenty years later, when the monastery was handed over to a Amtmann, another inventory was drawn up, in which there were hardly any sacred objects and only one chalice, which was not described in detail. Today, two silver communion chalices and two matching paten chalices have been preserved, but they are not on public display in the church.\nThe older goblet, made of gilded silver, has been dated to the 14th century. The 16.4-centimeter (5.9-inch) tall goblet has a flat, simple, round 14-centimeter (6-inch) diameter foot, a six-sided stem, a ribbed nodus, and a broadly flared, simple 11.7-centimeter (4-inch) diameter bowl. The low vertical rim of the foot is decorated with a row of dots and crosses, while the shaft has a surrounding ornament of crosses at the top and bottom. The inscription on the top of the foot reads \"- CVRT - HANS - HENRICH - VON - VSLER - MARIA - VON - VSLER - ELSABET - SOPHIÆ - VON - VSLER - PIGATA - MAGDALENA - VON - VSLER - SCHONETTE - LISABETH - VON - VSLER\". Based on the names mentioned, the inscription can most likely be dated to the second quarter of the 17th century, as the Brunswick-Lüneburg district commissioner and war commissary Curt Hans Heinrich von Uslar married Maria von Uslar in 1627 and had daughters Elisabeth Sophie, Beate Magdalena and Schonetta Elisabeth with her. The latter was already married in 1661, so the inscription was probably added well before that date. The inscription \"FB / 1908\" from a more recent period is carved under the foot of the chalice.\n\nThe matching paten from the second quarter of the 17th century is also made of gilded silver and has a diameter of 15.8 centimeters. It bears an inscription on the rim, identical to that of the chalice except for two letters, and a disk cross.\nThe second silver goblet is 18 centimeters high and dates from the end of the 16th century. The base and the foot, which is 14 centimeters in diameter, are in the shape of a hexagon, above which is a hexagonal stem with a flattened nodus on the side, bearing the letters \"I H E S V S\" in diamond form and, like the stem, decorated with engraved ornaments. The small, steeply rising bowl is ten centimeters in diameter. A reclining gilded crucifix is placed on one segment of the base, while the four-part Brunswick-Calenberg coat of arms of Duke Erich is engraved on the opposite segment. The inscription \"TEMPLO REINHVSANO SACRVM\" is engraved on the edge next to the crucifix, proving that it belonged to the Reinhausen church. The segment of the base bears the initials of the bailiff: \"M(ATTHIAS) - S(CHILLING) - A(MT)M(ANN) - Z(V) - R(EIN)H(AVSEN)-\", which allows an approximate dating: Matthias Schilling took office as ducal Amtmann of Reinhausen in 1578, Duke Erich died in 1584. Since both are named on the goblet, it must have been made during this period.\nThe accompanying silver paten measures 15.1 centimeters in diameter. It bears the same engraved inscription as the chalice, \"TEMPLO REINHVSANO SACRVM,\" on the bottom of the rim, and a disk cross on the top.\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe current organ in St. Christopher Church was built in 1967 by Rudolf Janke to replace an older organ. It has a five-stop manual division flanked by two freestanding pedal towers. The instrument has 16 stops on two manuals and pedal. The specification is as follows:\n\nCouplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\nThe predecessor of the present organ was moved from Osterode am Harz to Reinhausen in 1841. When the castle church of St. Jacobi in Osterode received a new organ from the master organ builder Johann Andreas Engelhardt, the old organ was given free of charge to the St. Christopher Church in Reinhausen.\n\n\n== Bells ==\n\nFor a long time there was only one large bell in the church, cast in bronze by the Radler bell foundry in Hildesheim in 1890. In 1948, the company J.F. Weule from Bockenem made an hour bell weighing 60 kilograms and a quarter-hour bell weighing 45 kilograms for the church. These smaller bells are striking bells and hang in the north tower of the church.\nThe oldest bell in the church was cast in 1585 by a bell founder named Rofmann, who is not listed in the relevant directories, but was hung in the tower of St. Christopher's Church only after the Second World War. It originally came from East Prussia in the district of Mohrungen and was brought to Hamburg during the war to be melted down. This bell is 60 centimeters high, 73.5 centimeters high with the crown, and has a diameter of 84.5 centimeters. It weighs 360 kilograms and bears the following inscription on its shoulder: \"DVRCHS - FEVWR - BIN - ICH - GEFLOSSEN - MIT GOTTES - HILF HAT - MICH - ROFMAN - GEGOSSEN - 1585 -\".\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe Counts of Reinhausen owned their ancestral castle on the rock above the village, now known as \"Kirchberg\", which they converted into a Stift at the end of the 11th century. The former private church on this castle was thus given the function of a collegiate church.\nWhen the canons' monastery was converted into a Benedictine monastery at the beginning of the 12th century, the church became a monastery church. It was consecrated between 1107 and 1115 by Bishop Reinhard of Halberstadt. In addition to being a monastery church, the church also served as a place of worship for the people of Reinhausen, with the monastery holding parish rights.\nWith the introduction of the Reformation in 1542 by Duchess Elisabeth of Brunswick-Calenberg-Göttingen, the monastery under Abbot Johann Dutken had to convert to the Lutheran confession. The abbot died in 1549. From 1548 to 1553, the monastery and church were re-catholicized by Elizabeth's son Erich II as part of the Augsburg Interim, and an abbot was appointed in the person of Peter of Utrecht. At the end of the Interim in 1553, he refused to accept the new Lutheran doctrine and was arrested and expelled from Reinhausen. Jacob Pheffer was the last monk of the old monastery to die in Reinhausen in 1564.\nDuring the Reformation, the church was used by the parish of Reinhausen as a parish church and the parish was merged with the parish of Diemarden. The parish of Reinhausen was dissolved and the parish was looked after by the priest of Diemarden as a mother church without its own parish (mater coniuncta). During the Thirty Years' War there was another attempt at re-Catholicization, but it lasted only from 1629 to 1631. During this time the Lutheran pastor was expelled from the church. The inhabitants of Reinhausen were forced to accept Catholic holidays and services. It was also forbidden to attend the Protestant church service in the neighboring village of Diemarden under threat of punishment, and the way there was strictly controlled.\nThe church building had been owned by the Dukes of Braunschweig-Lüneburg since the Reformation. The first and second floors of the church were still being used in 1865 for the Reinhausen office, which was housed in the adjacent former cloister. Interest crops were stored and sold from there. In 1956 the church was handed over to the parish in accordance with the provisions of the Loccum Treaty.\nThe former monastery church now serves as the parish church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and, together with the church in Diemarden, is served by a parish office that has been located in Reinhausen since 1962. Both parishes belong to the church district of Göttingen-Münden in the Hildesheim-Göttingen branch of the regional church of Hannover. The Reinhausen congregation has nearly 900 members and maintains the church, the cemetery to the south and east, and the local kindergarten.  The church also serves as a branch of the Catholic parish of St. Michael in Göttingen. Until January 2010, Catholic Mass was celebrated in the monastery church twice a month, but since then, only on four holidays a year.\nThe church also serves as a venue for church music and (sacred) concerts. In 2015, the parish formed a concert team to plan and organize musical events. The church is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. for viewing and prayer and is marked as a \"reliably open church\". It is located on the Via Scandinavica, one of the Camino de Santiago routes in Germany.\nIn 2014, special services, concerts, lectures, guided tours and other events have been planned and held to celebrate the church's thousand years of history. Since the exact date of the church's construction is not known and written records date back to a later period, the millennium celebration of the church refers to a time when the existence of the church can be considered certain based on the existing structural substance.\n\n\n== Pastors ==\nSince the introduction of the Reformation in 1542, the congregation has been served by Evangelical Lutheran pastors with brief interruptions. Many of the pastors who have served St. Christopher's since that time are known by name.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Christopher Reinhausen, website of the parish at \"We are evangelical\", accessed on April 13, 2016\nSt. Christopher Reinhausen on the website of the church building association, accessed on September 18, 2013\nHistorical photos of the monastery church and its furnishings on the website www.unser-reinhausen.de by Christian and Karin Schade, accessed on January 24, 2019\nImage index of art and architecture with historical photos of the monastery church and its furnishings, retrieved on January 24, 2019\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nUlfrid Müller: Die Klosterkirche in Reinhausen.

        "content": "Donaueschingen Palace (German: Schloss Donaueschingen), also known as the Fürstenberg palace (German: Fürstlich Fürstenbergisches Schloss), is a princely residence in French Baroque Revival architecture. It is situated in Donaueschingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is the seat of the princes of Fürstenberg, who still own and live in the palace. It is surrounded by a large park, where next to the palace the source of the Danube is located in the northwestern edge. The palace can be visited during guided tours, as well as rented for events\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 17th century and prior: Before the current palace was constructed ===\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, there was already a fortified house here, which was owned by a member of the Blumberg family in 1292. By 1488, the House of Fürstenberg acquired Donaueschingen from Barbara von Habsburg and subsequently abandoned their castle Burg Entenburg.\nAround 1556, Count Friedrich II of Fürstenberg (1496–1559) commissioned the construction of a (much smaller) predecessor building at the site of the current palace. However, this construction was erected on weak foundations and remained unfinished for a long time until his son Henry completed the construction and frequently stayed here, after he inherited the Baar region from his brothers. In his work Donaustrand, Sigmund von Birken depicts a view of the village with the old castle (around 1680).\n\n\n=== First half 18th century: Donaueschingen becomes the main Fürstenberg residence ===\n\nAt the start of the 18th century, the territories of the Fürstenberg family were divided over various territories: the county of Heiligenberg, the lordship of Meßkirch, and the county of Stühlingen. But as all family branches except one became extinct, the territories were reunified into one principality of Fürstenberg by 1744. As the village of Donaueschingen was centrally located, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, Prince of Fürstenberg (1699–1762) decided to move his capital from Stühlingen to here. The decision was made in 1720, but only happened in 1723. And Donaueschingen remained the main seat when the Meßkirch branch passed away in 1744. The village transferred from a settlement into a city.\nAs the existing building did not meet the requirements for the new capital of the principality, the decision was made to replace it by a new palace. František Maxmilián Kaňka was engaged to make the design for the palace in baroque style. Initially, plans were conceived for a grandiose complex comprising three wings with a large basin fed by the Danube basin. However, things turned out quite differently, and for one simple reason: In 1723, Prince Josef Wilhelm Ernst married Countess Anna Maria von Waldstein. His attention shifted to Prague, where Bohemia became his new focus. With a keen eye for finances, the lavish palace plans were set aside. Instead, only a side wing was built, serving as both administrative offices and living quarters for numerous princely officials. The building was rather plain and functional. It had approximately the same dimensions as the palace today: four stories high, 21 windows wide with a Mansard roof. Old illustrations (such as those by Jakob Alt from 1824 and Wilhelm Scheuchzer from 1827) depict it as a simple but dignified and generous structure. \nIn the vicinity of the palace, further buildings were constructed such as the princely court library between 1732 and 1735, the Fürstenberg Brewery between 1705 and 1739, and the princely archives between 1756 and 1763.\n\n\n=== Second half 18th century: Donaueschingen becomes a vivid residence ===\nSo in the first years as residence, Donaueschingen palace was primarily an administrative seat. This changed under Joseph Wilhelm Ernst's son, prince Joseph Wenzel (1728–1783), who made Donaueschingen his main residence. Naturally, he moved into the palace – a decision that caused significant unrest among the officials who had previously resided there and subsequently triggered extensive construction activity: suitable housing had to be provided for all the employees. In addition, new buildings were required for the administration, which also had been housed in the palace until then. The city of Donaueschingen experienced a true building boom.\nFrom 1770 onwards, Joseph Wenzel had the magnificent palace park laid out, established a court chapel, built hunting lodges, and even erected a court theater. As for the palace itself, Joseph Wenzel left it as it was – a modest and, despite its size, almost austere structure.\n\n\n=== First half 19th century: a fire ravages the palace ===\n\nOn December 8, 1821, a fire destroyed the old western part of the castle, including the St. Nicholas Chapel, forcing the young princely couple – Charles Egon II, Prince of Fürstenberg (1796–1854) and his wife Amalie (1795–1869) – to reside in the Karlshof until the burned part of the palace was replaced in 1828. This property on Josephstraße had recently been purchased by Major von Koller († December 5, 1834). After the burned parts were demolished, a neoclassical ballroom was constructed on the second floor according to designs by the Baden architect Friedrich Weinbrenner, which can be considered his final work.\nThe ‘‘Karlsbau’’ with the princely collections was completed in 1868. Until then (1865), the collections had been housed in schloss Hüfingen, a castle constructed built in 1712 by prince Froben Ferdinand of Fürstenberg-Mößkirch (1664-1741).\n\n\n=== Second half 19th century: the Belle Époque arrives in Donaueschingen ===\nBetween 1892 and 1896, Charles Egon IV, Prince of Fürstenberg (1852–1896) undertook a significant reconstruction of the palace, both inside and outside. Amand Bauqué, a French architect based in Vienna, was commissioned for the design, with support from architect Albert Emilio Pio. They embraced the popular baroque revival style, prevalent in Paris and Vienna during that era, known as the Belle Époque. The main façade facing the garden was adorned with an Avant-corps to rhythmize the endless rows of windows. The roof underwent a redesign, featuring a central dome. Atop the central part of the façade, the coat of arms of the Fürstenberg family is displayed alongside two ancient imperial busts of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, acquired specifically for this purpose in Rome in 1895.\nAdditionally, the interior was adorned with a grand staircase, leading to an adjoining hall and apartments in Louis XV style. Concurrently, the park underwent a transformation, echoing the baroque revival aesthetic, including a revision of the Danube source. Despite a few modernisations, the palace has retained its original character ever since.\nIn 1894, the Stallegg hydroelectric power plant was also constructed to provide lighting to the palace and park, and energy for the Fürstenberg Brewery.\n\n\n=== First half 20th century: center of the German imperial jet-set ===\n\nCharles Egon IV was succeeded by Maximilian Egon II, Prince of Fürstenberg (1863–1941), who was a close friend and adviser of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. He inherited territorial titles in Prussia, Austria, Hungary, Württemberg and Baden, and by virtue of them had a seat in the House of Lords in each of the five states. Until the First World War, he was vice-president of the Prussian House of Lords. Donaueschingen was Max's main seat and emperor Wilhelm II frequently visited him there.\nMaximillian Egon II engaged the architects of Donaueschingen, Bauqué and Pio, to redesign the main Fürstenberg country seat in Bohemia, Lány Castle, which is now the summer residence of the president of the Czech Republic.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nDuring the mid of the 20th century, the main seat of the Fürstenberg princes was Schloss Hohenlupfen in Stühlingen. But in the 1970s, they moved back to Donaueschingen. In the meantime, the palace was opened to the general public.\nThe current head of the Fürstenberg family, prince Henry moved into the palace in 2002. He started an extensive renovation of the palace, which was completed in 2007. Also he restructured his estates, which resulted in the sale of Hohenlupfen castle.\nIn 2023, the princely family hosted a large event celebrating 300 years Donaueschingen.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe interior design and furniture in neo-styles represent the periods from the Renaissance through Régence and Rococo to the Empire period. Noteworthy is the reception hall illuminated by a skylight, which houses, among other things, a wooden bench from around 1520 from the Strozzi family and a Florentine sandstone fireplace from around 1480. Both were acquired through the mediation of the art historian and Berlin museum director Wilhelm von Bode. The Great and Small Salons, the dining room, and the surprisingly modern bathroom for the princess at that time are also worth seeing.\n\n\n== Music at the Palace ==\n\nIn 1763, the Mozart family visited Donaueschingen for twelve days, during which the ten-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed a cello piece for Prince Joseph Wenzel of Fürstenberg and received 24 gold ducats in return. Later, the operas Die Entführung aus dem Serail and The Marriage of Figaro premiered here in Germany for the first time. Pieces by Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Anton von Webern, or Richard Strauss also premiered here.\nIn 1921, the first \"chamber music performances to promote contemporary music\" took place in this ballroom, which later led to the famous Donaueschingen Music Days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nFeger, Robert (1984).

        "content": "Sverre Dahlen Aspenes (born 20 June 1997) is a Norwegian biathlete. He made his debut in the Biathlon World Cup in 2022. Aspenes is a two-time European 2022 champion in the individual and pursuit races.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSverre Dahlen Aspenes entered the biathlon sport in 2007, but he didn't make his international debut until relatively late. Initially, he competed in cross-country skiing at the national junior championships in 2015 and 2016. Aspenes made his first biathlon appearances at the Junior European Championships in 2017 in Nové Město na Moravě. Just a year later, the Norwegian won his first international title, unexpectedly triumphing in the pursuit race at the 2018 Junior World Championships. Additionally, he secured a bronze medal in the sprint. Aspenes made his debut in the IBU Cup three years later in Obertilliach, immediately achieving a good result with 12th place in the sprint.\nAspenes' breakthrough came in the 2021/22 season. Before the turn of the year, he already had a podium finish and another top-10 result to his name, earning him a place alongside three other athletes as a replacement for the absent A-team in the Biathlon World Cup in Ruhpolding. With the relay team, he finished seventh, and he earned his first World Cup points by finishing 25th in the pursuit. The following 2022 European Championships at Arber brought further success, with Aspenes winning gold in the individual and pursuit events, making him the most successful athlete of the championships. After another victory in the IBU Cup, Aspenes concluded his season in Kontiolahti and Oslo in the World Cup, achieving more placements around the top 30 and finishing 62nd overall. In the IBU Cup rankings, he ended the season in third place behind Erlend Bjøntegaard and Håvard Bogetveit.\nIn contrast to the previous winter, the 2022/23 season was relatively unsuccessful for Aspenes due to personal reasons. He only competed in the IBU Cup in Idre and managed to achieve top-10 finishes three times. As defending champion, he could not surpass 14th place in the pursuit at the European Championships. However, he ended the season by becoming the Norwegian champion in the sprint, comfortably distancing himself from Vetle Paulsen and Johannes Thingnes Bø. He finished second behind Bø in the mass start. In the winter of 2023/24, Aspenes mainly competed at the national level and only joined the IBU Cup for the season finale in Obertilliach, where he dominated the race times and secured his second victory at that level after two podium finishes in the season-ending mass start event.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAspenes lives at the biathlon training center in Lillehammer. He had a younger brother Knut who took his own life in the summer of 2022, prompting Aspenes to skip almost the entire 2022/23 season.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n=== Youth and Junior World Championships ===\n2 medals (1 gold, 1 bronze)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSverre Dahlen Aspenes at FIS (cross-country)",

        "content": "The Skirmish at the Strait of Malacca (Danish; Træfningen ved Malakkastrædet) was a skirmish between the claimed governor of Tranquebar, Bernt Pessart, and the local authorities of Dutch Malacca. The confrontation led to the imprisonment or death of all of Pessart's crew and the confiscation of the vessel, Dend gode Haab. Although Pessart and his crew would later be released and cooperate with the Dutch to spy on the Spanish in Manila.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBernt Pessart's regime had greatly damaged Danish East Indian commerce, and as a response Willem Leyel was sent from Copenhagen to Dansborg to arrest Pessart. Pessart had gotten the news of his ordered arrest, and imprisoned the messenger. When Pessart's spies had informed him about Willem's arrival, he hastly bought a Portuguese vessel, which he named Dend gode Haab (The Good Hope), and left for Japan.\nPessart sailed east in order to pass throught the Strait of Malacca on his way to Japan, yet the Dutch had seized Malacca from the Portuguese in 1641, and sharply regulated the bypassing ships in order to preserve their spice monopoly. When Pessart entered the Straits, the heavy wind stopped and they thereafter layed becalmed near Malacca.\n\n\n== Skirmish ==\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nWhile the ship layed becalm, the crew spend their time drinking, meanwhile a Dutch mate from a nearby ship came over to inspect to ship. The mate was invited to share their drink, though, the drunk Danes quickly started an arguement with the mate, and Danish Michel Evertsen came in fight with the Dutchman. The Dutch mate escaped with torned clothes and a number of wounds.\n\n\n=== Action ===\nWhen the wounded mate returned to his own ship, the officers deemed this treatment unacceptable, and sent a boat of full armed men to Dend gode Haab. The Drunkened Danes tried to defend themselves, yet could hardly stand upright. Pessart was wounded in the foot by a spear, and he and his crew was put in prison.\nIt is unknown how many casualties there were, yet we are informed that the vessel, Christianshavn's former mate, Peter de Sivart, and several others died on the way to Batavia, and it is likely that it was here.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe surviving Danes imprisoned, and Dend gode Haab was confiscated and brought to Malacca City. Pessart and his crew remained in prison for three months, though Pessart heavely protested for his release and the Dutch authorities finaly gave in and sent Pessart, his crew and Dend gode Haab to Batavia, where a case on the matter would be brought before the local court.\nAfter six further months of imprisonment in Batavia, Pessart's ship was given back, though with a new mission to (instead of going to Japan) espionage on Spanish Philippines.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSiege of Malacca (1641) – Dutch siege against Portugal in Malacca, Malaysia\nJohor Sultanate – Sultanate of Johor\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\nWillem Leyel's siege of Dansborg – Siege of Fort Dansborg, 1644\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Neurorealism (also referred to as neuro-realism or neuroessentialism) is a concept within popular science where individuals ascribe more meaning to psychological phenomena merely because it is backed up by brain imaging methods.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe term \"Neurorealism\" was first coined in 2005 by neuroscientists Eric Racine, Ofek Bar-Ilan, and Judy Illes. They noticed that media outlets were uncritical in their analysis of fMRI evidence in support of psychological processes, such as the relief from pain via acupuncture, political beliefs, and even pleasure from eating foods high in fat. They go on to conclude that neurorealism is \"grounded in the belief that fMRI enables us to capture a ‘visual proof ’ of brain activity, despite the enormous complexities of data acquisition and image processing\". The researchers encouraged journalists to be more conscientious of how they report topics related to neuroscience, given that neurological claims tend to hold more weight to the lay reader.\nResearcher David Gruber commented that \"currently, no research on neuro-realism examines the variable rhetorical roles of such statements, that is, how they support specialized arguments or enhance social functions across genres of public communication.\" He also states that neurorealism is a result of the over simplification of difficult scientific information, as it is usually fit for a more technical audience.\n\n\n=== In other research ===\nPsychologist Scott Lilienfeld commented that neuro-realism has a potential to affect jurors in punishing criminals afflicted with psychopathy. As a result, juries may place undue weight on brain imaging, even though differences in the brains of psychopaths and non-psychopaths do not necessarily indicate the differences are \"congenital, immutable, or directly causative of behavioral deficits\". According to Lilienfeld and others, arguments that psychopathic brain deficits negate criminal responsibility \"require leaps\" beyond the scientific data, as brain activity during an unrelated task does not explain a specific criminal act. Even among those diagnosed with psychopathy, criminal acts may reflect many factors beyond the personality disorder. Lilienfeld and his colleagues levied criticisms towards scientific journalism as a whole for engaging in \"neurohype\", or misrepresenting the impact of certain scientific findings, usually utilizing words such as \"breakthrough\",\"miracle\",\"cure\",\"revolutionary\", \"groundbreaking\", and \"marvel\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nBrain mapping\nUrban legend\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nPopular psychology\nHuman brain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle in The Guardian on neurorealism titled \"Lost your libido?

        "content": "Thota Trimurthulu (born 22 April 1961) is an Indian politician from Andhra Pradesh. He was a three-time MLA from Ramachandrapuram in East Godavari district. He is nominated to contest as MLA on YSRCP ticket from Mandapeta Constituency in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election. He is convicted by a court for 18 months imprisonment in a Dalit atrocities case of 1996.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTrimurthulu was born in Venkatayapalem, Ramachandrapuram mandal, East Godavari District. He completed Class VII from Mandal Parishad Upper Primary School, Venkatayapalem in 1972. His parents Pundarikakshulu and Suryakantham were farmers. He married Surya Kumari. \n\n\n== Career ==\nTrimurthulu was active as a youth leader in Ramachandrapuram and joined Telugu Desam Party in 1982, in the initial years after it was started by former Chief Minister N. T. Ramarao. He was elected as an MLA for the first in 1994 as an independent candidate from Ramachandrapuram and joined TDP in 1995. In 1999, he was elected again as an MLA on the TDP ticket. In 2004, he lost to P. Subhash Chandra Bose. In 2008, he joined Praja Rajyam Party of actor Chiranjeevi, but lost the 2009 election on PRP seat. When PRP was merged with the Congress, he got elected again in the 2012 bye-election.\nAfter the state was bifurcated, he joined the Telugu Desam Party again and won for the third time. In 2014, contesting on the Telugu Desam Party ticket, he defeated Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose of YSRCP by a margin of 16,922 votes. In 2019, he lost to Chelluboyina Srinivasa Venugopalakrishna of YSRCP by 5,168 votes. Later in September 2019, he joined YSRCP and promised to work closely with Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose, with whom he had a deep rivalry. By then, Bose became a Deputy Chief Minister. And in June 2021, he was nominated as MLC in the Governor’s quota.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhen he was an independent MLA of Ramachandrapuram, Thota Trimurthulu was the prime accused in a Dalit atrocity case registered by Draksharam police on 29 December 1996. He and a few others have tonsured the heads and shaved the eyebrows of two Dalit youths, K Chinna Raju and D Venkata Ratnam, and beat up a three other youths of Venkatayapalem village of the erstwhile East Godavari district as they did not support the rigging during the previous election. On 16 April 2024, the XI ADJ and SC & ST Court in Visakhapatnam convicted nine men, including Trimurthulu to 18 months imprisonment and a fine of Rs.42,000 each.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pectinereis is a genus of nereid worm that contains only the species Pectinereis strickrotti. The genus name is a combination of the Latin words pectinis (comb) and Nereis (the type genus of the family). The species is named for Bruce Strickrott, lead pilot of the deep-submergence vehicle Alvin. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that Pectinereis strickrotti is most closely related to Alitta, Nectoneanthes, and Nereis.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMost nereidids perform oxygen exchange in branchiae; however, Pectinereis strickrotti possesses more elaborate gills. Furthermore, some nereidids use their respiratory organs for pheromone reception and as sexual adaptations, but this is not the case in P. strickrotti. When the worm is a sexually mature epitok, its body is divided into four regions, unlike the two regions of other nereidids. The rear chaetae undergo the fewest changes during epitoky, and may even be unmodified. The internal acicula are also unique; some of them in the rear parapodia are very stout, slightly curved, have a blunt end, and extend beyond the parapodial surface. These are called \"hooked acicula,\" and are most near in appearance to those of Tambalagamia fauveli.\n\n\n== Distribution, habitat, and ecology ==\n\nSpecimens of the worm were first collected in 2018 by the deep-submergence vehicle Alvin off the research vessel Atlantis. They were found swimming near a methane seep off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica at a depth of around 1,000 meters. This habitat is unusual, as other related nereid worms are not found in the deep sea, but in shallow waters.\nThe diet and feeding habits of Pectinereis strickrotti are unknown.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nVillalobos-Guerrero, Tulio; Huč, Sonja; Tilic, Ekin; et al.

        "content": "The Intellectuals' Hearth (Turkish: Aydınlar Ocağı) is a conservative-Islamist think thank which has been instrumental in the formation of right-wing political movements in Turkey since its formation in 1970. The influence of the group increased following the military coup on 12 September 1980 through its development and introduction of the Turkish–Islamic synthesis.\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nImmediately after the military coup of 27 May 1960 which ended the rule of Democrat Party a group of conservative academics and thinkers, including Süleyman Yalçın, Arif Nihat Asya, Kemal Ilıcak, Tarık Buğra and Ali Fuat Başgil established an association called the Thinkers Club (Turkish: Aydınlar Kulübü) in 1961 of which ideology was a synthesis of Turkism and Islamism. Yalçın was elected as the first president of the association. Major members of the Club included İsmail Dayı, Ayhan Songar, Necmettin Erbakan and Agah Oktay Güner. It was disbanded in 1965.\nThe Intellectuals' Hearth (IH) succeeded the Thinkers Club to provide an alternative to Turkish youth against the Turkish leftist intellectual movements which had gained strength as a result of the 1968 movements. It was founded on 14 May 1970, the twentieth anniversary of the Democrat Party's victory in the 1950 general election. Its name was suggested by the conservative thinker Necip Fazıl Kısakürek to emphasize the fact that intellectuals might also adopt right-wing views. The founders of the IH included İbrahim Kafesoğlu, Muharrem Ergin, Ahmet Kabaklı, Süleyman Yalçın, Nevzat Yalçıntaş, Kemalettin Erbakan, Ayhan Songar and Asım Taşer.\nThe branches of the IH were established in various cities from 1980. The first one was opened in Ankara, and the others in Bursa, Kocaeli, İzmir, Erzurum and Konya. The number of the IH branches was eight in 1988.\nAs of 2017 the IH was described as a political lobby group far from its former power and influence with its discourses of cooperation with Kemalism, nationalism and left-wing politics. \n\n\n=== Presidents and notable members ===\nThe founding president of the IH was İbrahim Kafesoğlu. The other presidents of the IH included Süleyman Yalçın, Salih Tuğ, Ayhan Songar (acting) and Nevzat Yalçıntaş. Mustafa Erkal has been serving as the IH president since 1998.\nThe members of the IH are mostly conservative journalists, academics and intellectuals. From its start in 1970 to 1988 the membership of the IH was strictly limited to those who had a profession. The IH members increased in 1988 when this limitation was relaxed. As of 2011 the number of the IH members was 270.\nMuharrem Ergin was a member of the IH who shaped the ideology of the group. Necip Fazıl Kısakürek became a member of the IH in 1975. Another notable member was Tarık Buğra who was also part of the Thinkers Club. Hasan Celal Güzel and Şaban Karataş were Ankara-based IH members. The latter also headed the Ankara branch of the IH after 1987. Mükerrem Taşçıoğlu, a politician from the Motherland Party, was also a member of the IH.\n\n\n== Activities, views and political influence ==\nThe IH began organizing seminars and conferences soon after its establishment. These conferences in the 1970s were attended by future politicians such as Abdullah Gül and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The group also has had charitable associations, hospitals such as Türkiye Hastanesi, companies, schools, mosques and financial institutions. Various media outlets, including Türkiye Gazetesi, TGRT TV and some radio channels, were also close to the IH in the late 1990s.\nThe IH opposes both elitist and statist approaches. The nationalist views of the historian Nihal Atsız have been supported by the IH members. \nOne of the most important views developed by the IH is the Turkish–Islamic synthesis which was first used in 1973. It was developed based on the assumption that people may be both  nationalistic and religious without any contradiction. There are various claims about its major components, Turkish nationalism and Islamism. Some argue that its main ideology is Islamism, not Turkish nationalism. However, in the late 1990s it was speculated that its focus was on Turkish nationalism not on Islamism. The nationalism component of the synthesis was defined as national culture rather than race. The synthesis also covered some Western elements, including advancement in science, technology and economics and reinforced the Western military and political doctrines.\nIn line with the IH's goal to offer a shared ideology for right-wing political parties in Turkey the Turkish–Islamic synthesis has been employed by various political groups. The synthesis was adopted by the Nationalist Movement Party in its party program in the 1970s. It was then used as a basis for the nationalist coalition governments, known as Nationalist Front, formed by the Justice Party, Nationalist Movement Party and National Salvation Party in the second half of the 1970s.\nThe Turkish–Islamic synthesis was also employed by the military government from 1980 to reestablish the social order of Turkish society which had been damaged during the terrorist activities in the 1970s. One of the reasons for its adoption was that it was against political Islam and regarded Islam as a cultural element focusing on its prayers and rituals. The fact that it had no conflict with the Kemalist regime was another factor in its acceptance by the state apparatus. As a result, the synthesis was officially endorsed by the Atatürk Supreme Council on 20 June 1986 as the basis of the Turkish cultural activities. The ruling Motherland Party also adopted and supported the Turkish–Islamic synthesis between 1983 and 1989 under the leadership of Turgut Özal. \nIn the 1980s the influence of the IH was not limited to political area in that textbooks and educational programs of Turkish schools were written and developed in parallel to the Turkish–Islamic synthesis. In addition, the IH members were appointed to various posts at the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation and the Council of Higher Education.\nIn the late 1990s Turkish nationalism became the dominant ideology of the IH. However, as a result of the rise of the Islamist political parties Islamism also gained importance in the IH. Such changes led to differences within the IH concerning the political parties supported. The nationalist wing became closer to the Nationalist Movement Party whereas the Islamist wing began to develop connections with the international Islamist movements.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe IH has been criticized due to its cooperation with the military leaders of the 1980 coup. For instance, Gencay Şaylan, a Turkish academic and political scientist, argued in 1988 that the IH is an organization similar to Opus Dei in terms of its aim to formulate an intellectual and ethical basis for an authoritarian political system in Turkey. In 1998 Burak Arıkan likened the IH to the Nouvelle Droite which provided a right-wing ideology to the political groups in France.\nThe group is also regarded as a tool of the Turkish state in the Cold War setting to reduce and ultimately, eliminate the potential effects of Communism in the country.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Charles Mead (October 2, 1792 – January 10, 1873) was an English LMS missionary and educator. Apart from promoting Christianity in South Travancore, he laid the foundations for Western education in the region. The work he did on behalf of the London Missionary Society in the city of Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu, India (then part of the Kingdom of Travancore) earned him the sobriquet, the Sculptor of Nagercoil.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCharles Mead was born to Anglican parents on October 2, 1792, in Bristol in the county of Gloucester, England. His maternal uncle, Rev. John Hunt, was a pastor in Wakefield. Mead did his schooling in Gosport Missionary School, Yorkshire. He was ordainated on March 6, 1816.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMead married Anne Hunt, the daughter of his uncle John Hunt. Having already taken ill when they arrived at Chennai (formerly, Madras), Anne Hunt died after giving birth to a son at Prince of Wales Island harbour. Charles Mead proceeded to Colachel (in present day Kanyakumari district) with his son, John Hunt.\nMead then married Johanna Coelestina, the first female missionary to serve in South Travancore. She was the daughter of Rev. Horst who served as a missionary in Thanjavur. Johanna Mead contributed immensely to women's education and to the development of handicraft as a business amongst women in Nagercoil. Johanna died on February 6, 1848, in Neyyoor due to liver disease. She was forty five. The couple had ten children: Theodore, Joseph, Sophia Stemnett, Florence, Rachel, Ann Cammerer, Christopher Cornelius, Nathaniel, Eusebius, and James.\nIn 1852, five years after Johanna’s death, Mead married Lois Biddulph, the daughter of his assistant, Devavaram Biddulph. He was 60. The couple had four children: Mary Ann Mead, Joanna Carlotta Agur, John James Mead, and Celestina Florence Kohlhoff. European missionaries disapproved of his marriage to an Indian woman. Indian Christians too who registered their protest in various churches. Therefore, in April 1852, Mead resigned from his duties at the Missionary Society. The then Resident of Travancore granted him a government job and so Mead relocated to Thiruvananthapuram. He was appointed as a senior officer in the government's printing press and as an inspector for English schools. He was a minister at an English church that was part of the Christian Mission Society (C.M.S.) as well. The campus where he stayed in Thiruvananthapuram is now known as Mead's Compound.\nMead was father to fifteen children from his three wives. Joanna Carlotta, a daughter he had with his third wife, married the renowned Christian historian, C.M. Agur, the author of the classic book, Church History of Travancore\n\n\n== Religious work ==\nMead, who joined the London Missionary Society, was nominated to succeed William Tobias Ringeltaube in Nagercoil, after his death. He left England, along with his wife, on April 20, 1816, and landed in Chennai on August 28, 1816. Rev. Richard Knill accompanied him.\n\nAt the Madras Presidency, Mead stayed with the first English missionary in Madras, Rev. Loveless and learnt the Tamil language. His wife was undergoing medical treatment at that time. He informed Col. Munro, the then Resident of Travancore of their impending arrival and left for Travancore on September 9, 1817, along with his wife. He reached Colachel on January 17, 1818 without his wife, who died enroute.\nIn Colachel, Mead was welcomed by the evangelist Vedamanikkam and other preachers, who by then had been converted by Rev. Ringeltaube. They escorted him to Myladi, where Mead witnessed first hand, the well-oiled missionary activities started by Ringeltaube. Mead stayed with Ringeltaube in a thatched hut, the latter's home. Mead was later allotted a government bungalow by Colonel Munro.\n\nIn due course, Mead relocated the headquarters of the Mission from Mylaudy to Nagercoil. The office of Colonel Munro in Nagercoil became his residence and the Church, his headquarters. In addition, Maharani Gowri Parvathi Bayi granted him the lands on which the Nagercoil Kasba Diocese Church and the printing press of Scott Christian College were located, as well as those surrounding these establishments.\nIn April 1818, the Maharani appointed Mead as the District Judge of Nagercoil. He also received a grant of five thousand rupees from her, towards the purchase of land and construction of a church in Nagercoil. Mead planned to build a large church with a capacity to seat at least three thousand people. On January 1, 1819, Rev. Knill laid the foundation for a church, 140 feet by 70 feet in area. The construction of the church was completed with monetary aid from Colonel Munro and the government. It later came to be known as C.S.I. Home Church.\n\nWhile serving as a government officer, Mead built a well-protected granary at Mylaudy, large enough to hold 1500 kottais of paddy. The upper storey of the granary was equipped with guest rooms for European visitors. Guards for the granary were chosen from Vedamonikam's family.\n\nMead's efforts increased the number of churches from seven at the end of Ringaltaube's tenure to fifteen by the year 1819. He divided the South Travancore Mission into five districts, viz., Nagercoil, Neyyoor, Parassala, Thiruvananthapuram, Attingal, and Kollam and laid down administrative guidelines to aid rapid growth.\n\n\n== Contribution to education ==\nMead started a seminary in Nagercoil in October 1819, where the languages of English, Tamil, and Malayalam were taught in addition to theology. In 1820, he also started an English school near the seminary. Johanna Mead, his wife, started a girls school and a handicrafts training institute in the vicinity. Mead dreamt of the seminary becoming a college someday, and so it did. In 1893, the seminary became the Scott Christian College. In 1820, Mead started an English school that aslo taught non-Christians students. The Neyyoor branch of the Mission started a similar school. By 1927, the London Missionary Society had opened 47 schools in South Travancore.\nIn 1820, while on a trip to Thanjavur, he came across a printing press. He bought it and promptly started Travancore’s first printing press in the city of Nagercoil. He used it to disseminate the Mission's news. Paper was shipped from Britain as a donation, since paper was not produced in Travancore. The printing press was called Travancore Mission Press.\nMead left South Travancore for Kumbakonam in 1825. He stayed there for almost two years and founded a new base for the Mission, there. He returned to Nagercoil in 1827 after having mobilised enough donations for the construction of the city's church. In 1828, he was transferred to the western districts, with its headquarters in Neyyoor. As there were no suitable residence in Neyyoor on his arrival, he stayed with his family in a small house beside the Mandaikadu beach, until a bungalow was built for him.\nIn December 1836, Mead left for England on a vacation, returning to Travancore in March 1838 after recuperating. He continued his religious and educational service in Thiruvananthapuram this time. In the last phase of his life, Mead turned full-time educator and ran both schools and presses in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\n== Upper Cloth Revolt ==\nIn the years 1828 and 1829, there were widespread opposition against women from the oppressed castes covering their upper body, a practice exclusive to high-caste women until then. Revolt broke out in and around the taluks of Kalkulam, Vilavancode, Agastheeswaram, and Eraniel. The upper castes' displeasure against religious conversion, also sowed the seeds for such an opposition. Mead met with the Resident and arranged to put an end to the revolt. On January 3, 1829, a mob laid siege to his house at Mandaikadu with an aim to assassinate Mead. Mead was rescued with the help of the army stationed at the Udayagiri fort. See also Upper-body Cloth Revolt.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCharles Mead died on January 10, 1873, at the age of 81. He was buried in the compound of the C.M.S. church in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\n== Memorials of Mead ==\nA street in Nagercoil is named in the memory of Charles Mead.\nC.S.I. Church has named as the Mead Memorial Church at mandaikadu, in Kanyakumari Diocese\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Casa Gioiosa or The House of Joy was a 15th century house in Mantua, Italy, owned by the Gonzaga family where the Italian pedagogue Vittorino da Feltre in 1423, set up a humanist school. The Casa Gioiosa, was a pioneering educational institution that aimed to provide a holistic and humanistic education to its students and soon became a model for Renaissance education, influencing educational practices throughout Europe. It emphasized the ideals of humanism and the importance of education in fostering personal growth and civic responsibility.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSituated between the Castello di San Giorgio and the Magna Domus, the Casa Gioiosa was originally constructed as a space for the pleasures and dances of the Gonzaga court. It was commissioned, likely by Francesco I Gonzaga, IV Captain of the People, who carried out substantial architectural and urbanistic interventions in the area. \nIn 1423, under the patronage of Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, the Marquess of Mantua, the Casa Gioiosa was repurposed as an educational institution. Gianfrancesco, known for his appreciation of arts and culture, entrusted Vittorino da Feltre, a renowned humanist educator, with the establishment. Vittorino founded a humanistic school and boarding house at the Casa Gioiosa, aiming to provide a comprehensive education to the children of the Gonzaga family and other noble Italian families.\nVittorino da Feltre's educational philosophy focused on a holistic approach, combining intellectual and physical education. In addition to subjects like rhetoric, mathematics, and philosophy, Vittorino emphasized physical education through games, fencing, running, horse riding, swimming, and ball games. The curriculum aimed to produce well-rounded individuals capable of contributing to society.\nThe Casa Gioiosa became a renowned center of Renaissance education, attracting students not only from noble Italian families but also from other regions. Many notable figures emerged from Vittorino's school, including politicians, prelates, and humanists. Vittorino's leadership of the school continued until his death in 1446, after which his pupils, such as Jacopo da San Cassiano and Ognibene da Lonigo, succeeded him.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nLudovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua\nBarbara of Brandenburg, Marquise of Mantua\nCarlo Gonzaga of Milan\nMargherita Gonzaga, Marquise of Ferrara\nFederico I Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua\nFederico da Montefeltro\nBattista Pallavicino\nBasinio Basini\nGiovanni Andrea Bussi\nIacopo da San Cassiano\nGeorge of Trebizond\nTheodorus Gaza\nTaddeo Manfredi\nNiccolò Perotti\nLorenzo Valla\nPietro Balbi\n\n\n== See also ==\nFeltre School\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Retha Walden Gambaro (December 9, 1917–September 9, 2013) was an American sculptor and gallery owner. \nShe is known for her own artworks that explore Indigenous American themes and for her curatorial practice that brought attention to contemporary Native American artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Gambaro advocated for and helped raise funds to establish the National Museum of the American Indian.  \n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nGambaro was born in Lenna, Oklahoma, to parents she identified as being of Native American descent. She identified her mother as having Muscogee descent and her father was having European and Cherokee descent. She grew up primarily in downtown Phoenix, Arizona, where she and her family moved when she was young. She attended public school through the 8th grade before leaving to support her family. Gambaro worked a variety of jobs including maid, seamstress, and engineering draftsman. She married Stephen A. Gambaro and worked to support him while he completed high school and college. In 1969, after the youngest of her three children left home, Gambaro, with newfound time and an empty nest, began experimenting with art, first, and only briefly, painting and then discovered a passion for sculpting. She enrolled, at the age of 52, in sculpture class at the Corcoran Gallery where she studied with Berthold Schmutzhart until 1971. \n\n\n== Career and legacy ==\nGambaro's career as an artist spanned late mid-life through old age. She first exhibited her sculpture in 1971 in her mid-fifties and continued sculpting until her mid-eighties. Works by Gambaro in stone, clay, copper, wood and bronze often feature female figures and themes of spirituality and reverence for nature.  \nHer work has been exhibited at the U.S. National Arboretum, Folger Shakespeare Library, Discovery Park Museum in Seattle, the Suffolk Museum, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the Gilcrease Museum, the Kennedy Center and the Heard Museum. In 2012, the Heard Museum exhibited a retrospective of Gambaro's work titled \"Attitudes of Prayer\" including Gambaro's self-portrait, \"Acceptance\" of a woman holding and looking at a fallen leaf.\n\n\n=== Via Gambaro Gallery ===\nIn 1973, Gambaro and her husband purchased a townhouse in Washington, D.C.'s historic Capitol Hill district with the goal of converting its two-story 19th century carriage house into a studio and gallery. Gambaro envisioned filling a void in the art world by creating the first gallery in the U.S. capital dedicated to works by contemporary Native American artists. Via Gambaro Gallery opened in 1976 and became a hub for promoting Native American art and artists.  \nExhibitions at the Via Gambaro Gallery highlighted contemporary Native American artists using modern techniques and materials with a goal of undermining stereotypes. Under Gambaro's leadership and in conjunction with her husband Stephen Gambaro a photographer known for portraits of Native Americans, Via Gambaro Gallery showcased the work of many contemporary Native American artists.   \nIn 1977, Via Gambaro Gallery curated and hosted Indian Artists, 1977 with the American Indian Society of Washington, D.C., featuring works by Arthur Amiotte, Benjamin Buffalo, Karita Coffey, Allan Houser, Neil Parsons, Kevin Red Star, and Daniel Nicholas along with works by Gambaro. The gallery's \"Indian Artists, 1978\" exhibition included works by seven faculty members of the Santa Fe Institute of American Indian Arts. Featured artists included Lawrence Ahvakana, Henry Gobin, and Larry Desjarlais. The gallery's 1980 show featured works by Native American women including Nadema Agard, Pegie Ahvakana, Diane M. Burns, Karita Coffey, Helen Hardin, Joan Hill, Linda Lomahaftewa, Jean McCarty Mauldin, Carol Soatikee, Alice Souligny, Dorothy Strait, and Christine C. Zuni along with works by Gambaro.  \n\n\n=== National Museum of the American Indian ===\nAs president of the Amerindian Circle of the Smithsonian Institution in 1982, Gambaro organized an exhibition featuring 120 Native American artists. The exhibition was featured at the Kennedy Center in conjunction with a star-studded gala event, Night of the First Americans, to launch the fundraising campaign for the National Museum of the American Indian. After the event, the exhibition moved to the Smithsonian Institution.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mohammad Al Attar (Arabic: محمد العطار; born 1980 in Damascus, Syria) is a Syrian playwright and dramaturg who lives in Berlin. His plays have been performed in the original Arabic versions or in translation in several countries, including the Middle East, the USA, United Kingdom, France and Germany. His plays are part of Syrian literature in the context of war and imprisonment.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAl Attar studied English literature at the University of Damascus and theater studies at the Higher Institute for Dramatic Arts in the Syrian capital. He then earned a master's degree in applied drama at Goldsmiths University , London. \nHis plays have been staged in translation at theaters in various countries, including the Avignon Festival and the Festival d'Automne in Paris, the Volksbühne Berlin, the Lincoln Center New York, the Royal Court Theatre in London, and the Kunsten Festival in Brussels, as well as at the Teatr Powszechny in Warsaw, the Onassis Stegi Cultural Center in Athens and the House of World Cultures in Berlin. \nIn addition to plays, Al Attar has also written articles for magazines, with a particular interest in the revolution in Syria since 2011. Because of his focus on the fate of refugees and the war in his country, he has been described as “an important chronicler of war-torn Syria.” \nAl Attar has lived in Berlin since 2015 and also is a fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. For several years, Al Attar has been working with the Syrian director Omar Abusaada. Her theater is characterized by both fictional and documentary elements.\nAl Attar's earliest play, Withdrawal, was performed in a cramped apartment in his hometown; his second, Could You Please Look into the Camera, followed a massive wave of arrests in his country. This text consists of testimonies from prisoners who were tortured in military prisons.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Al Attar and Abusaada performed a trilogy about the fates of refugee Syrian women, which is based on classical Greek tragedies. His adaptation of Iphigenia after Euripides was shown in 2017 at the Volksbühne in Berlin, preceded by The Trojan Women after Euripides in Jordan and Antigone of Shatila after Sophocles in Lebanon.\nIn the 2023/24 theatre season, the German premiere of Al Attar's work Damascus 2045 took place in the Theater Freiburg. The piece, set in a utopian future, addresses “the mechanisms of forgetting, the writing of war history and the narratives of the victors and the vanquished.” In March 2024, his play A Chance Encounter premiered in the same German theatre. In the plot, which is based on a real event, Anas, one of the main characters, meets the other protagonist, Walid Salem, by chance in Berlin. In the ensuing court case, both men try to remember their encounter ten years ago during an interrogation by the Syrian secret service. The piece thus addresses “the different meanings of justice and the stories of the past [...] that cannot be buried without facing them.”\n\n\n== Works ==\nWithdrawal (2007)\nSamah (2008)\nOnline (2011)\nCould You Please Look Into The Camera? (2011)\nA Chance Encounter (2012)\nAntigone Of Shatila (2014)\nWhile I Was Waiting (2016)\nIphigenia (2017)\nAleppo. A Portrait Of Absence (2017)\nThe Factory (2019)\nDamascus 2045 (2019)\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviews of the production of his play Iphigenia with Syrian amateur actresses at the Volksbühne Berlin in Tempelhof in September 2017 were largely negative. Critic Christian Rakow reported how Al Attar intended to “subvert common expectations of a documentary evening with refugees. There are no spotlights onto the political situation in Syria, and no close-up views of war atrocities or experiences of escape routes.” - With regard to the expectations of Western audiences, some Syrian authors have complained, however, that their works are often not met with an interest primarily for literary reasons. Rather, their works are expected to meet Orientalist clichés, for example regarding the dangers of the flight into exile or the trope of the oppressed Arab woman. \nThe German weekly Die Zeit judged that the piece “disarms all criticism by presenting itself hardly as an aesthetic project, but rather as an act of organized sympathy.” Further reviews in other German news media highlighted the acting performance, which was characterized by authentic and personal stories, but they criticized the classical Greek references as “not suitable.”\nThe more positive review of the production of A Chance Encounter highlighted how the author “continues to turn the screw of complexity, away from deadly struggles and towards the realities of life. In doing so, he gets really close to the audience, makes the distance to distant torture chambers disappear and anchors them as part of our history.“ \nA detailed description of Al Attar's theatre was published by the writer Caspar Shaller in Die Zeit  in 2017. He pointed out that the text for Iphigenia had been written in collaboration with eleven Syrian women, \"not only to merge their stories with Euripides' text, to give them a voice, but also to achieve a cathartic effect for the women themselves.\" In this context, Shaller also referred to the Theatre of the Oppressed as known by the Brazilian dramatist Augusto Boal, as a method setting people free.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMohammad Al Attar, Edward Ziter, Lisa Wedeen: Could You Please Look into the Camera?

        "content": "Mohammed Hamo (born 1958 or 1959) is a former Syrian Army general. In 2024 he was indicted by a court in Sweden for war crimes allegedly committed in 2012. He is the highest-ranking Syrian official to be tried in Europe for violations of international law.\nHamo was a brigadier general in the Syrian army during the first two years of the Syrian civil war. He worked in the 11th Armored Division and, according to prosecutors at his trial, played a vital role in both strategic decisions and implementing military operations. Hamo was also the leader of an armaments division and responsible for coordinating the supply of weapons to government troops. \nIn July 2012, Hamo defected to anti-government forces. According to opposition sources Hamo took part in fighting around Baba Amr during the siege of Homs.\nHamo ultimately emigrated to Sweden at an unknown date. After his residence in the country was discovered, he was arrested for war crimes on 7 December 2021, but was released after two days by order of a court.\nIn February 2024 Hamo was charged with aiding and abetting war crimes \"through advice and action\". According to prosecutors, Hamo bears responsibility for indiscriminate attacks in Homs and Hama between January and July 2012. Charges were filed against him by eight plaintiffs, including two foreign journalists injured in attacks on the Homs media centre. The decision to charge Hamo was praised by human rights organisations such as Civil Rights Defenders, which noted that the trial would be \"the first opportunity for victims of the attacks to have their voices heard in an independent court\". Hamo is the first Syrian official to stand trial over the country's military operations.\nHamo's trial began on April 15, 2024, and is expected to last until May 21. His defence argues that he was following orders.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The church of Santa Maria del Parto, popularly known as the church of Battù, is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was built thanks to the legacy of Marco Antonio Cassolio Gatta. The archives preserve a deed of alienation from 1875 to a certain Cavalier Motta which then became the property of the Dulio family.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe building has a façade divided into two orders by a stringcourse frame, and culminating with the triangular tympanum. The lower part has a portal with stone frames in the central part and two statues on the sides in two niches. In ancient times, in place of this church, there was another building of worship, called del Conte, as it was built by count Nicolò Trivulzio, and dedicated to the Beata Vergine del Parto; however, the people corrupted the name into Beata Vergine di Battù. According to other hypotheses, the name could derive from the Battuti brotherhood, or from the fact that the area in which the church stands was particularly subject to wind and weather.\nThe single nave interior preserves the sixteenth century fresco of the Lombard school, coming from the ancient pre-existing church, depicting the Madonna and Child placed as altarpiece on the side altar dedicated to her. The presbytery presents in the apse the lunette with the eighteenth century fresco depicting Christ praying in the garden of olive trees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Italian Labour Union (Italian: Unione Italiana del Lavoro, UIL) was an Italian national syndicalist trade union, active between 1918 and 1925. It is not to be confused with the current homonymous trade union established in 1950, which has no connection nor continuity with it, if not in the name.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe UIL was established on 9 July 1918 by former members of the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI), who had been expelled from USI's ranks due to their support for Italy's entry into World War I. It absorbed the Comitato sindacale italiano of Alceste De Ambris and the Unione Sindacale Milanese of Edmondo Rossoni. It was established upon a program of \"revolutionary conservation\" that tried to incorporate class struggle into a national frame.\nIts stronghold was among metal workers and peasants in Milan and Parma, but it also held considerable influence among Republican workers in Romagna, workers in La Spezia and employees in Rome. It was distinct from other unions for its anti-collectivist and anti-socialist views and for its support for corporatism. It was originally supportive towards the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento of Benito Mussolini.\nHowever, in 1920, the Fasci abandoned their previous left-wing/syncretic views and turned sharply to the right, causing the UIL to become hostile to it and vice-versa. This caused a split in the union, with a minority (led by Rossoni, Michele Bianchi and Sergio Panunzio) joining the Fasci and the majority (led by Alceste and Amilcare De Ambris) that became strongly hostile toward the Fascist movement.\nFollowing Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, the UIL was subjected to harsh persecution by the new government and eventually merged into the General Confederation of Labour (CGL) in the hope of uniting anti-fascist labour forces. CGL itself was banned by the fascist regime in 1927 and its members forced to go into exile. Amilcare De Ambris would eventually return to Italy and join the Fascist regime, while his brother Alceste would remain an anti-fascist for the remainder of its life.\nA trade union of the same name was established in 1950 from a split in the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), but has no connection to the original UIL.\n\n\n== References ==",

Of this remains a 1400s fresco depicting the Virgin, now displayed on an altar.\nThe various chapels date back to the seventeenth century. The main altar, from the eighteenth century in polychrome marble, contains a wooden statue of the Madonna. Placed in 1630 between the pillars, there are twelve life-size statues representing the Apostles. In the central nave there is the large fresco of the Apparition of the Virgin to St. Simone Stock, general of the Carmelites, created by the nineteenth-century painter from Vigevano Giovanni Battista Garberini.\nThe façade dates back to 1732. It is full of movement and variation of volumes, with a division marked by six fake pillars in the form of pilasters with niches framed by frames. The bell tower, however, was built in various phases and finished only in the eighteenth century.\n\n\n== References ==",

It took its name from an ancient church, perhaps from the early Middle Ages, which belonged to the Templars, located near a mill on the Terdoppio. In 1515 the old church, crumbling, was replaced by the new one, incorporated into the farmhouse. In 1743 the church was again in very bad conditions and, being close to ruin, in 1806 Mrs. Bolognara, widow Borgnis, had it rebuilt; in the same year the capitular vicar Tornaghi blessed it.\nAlways little frequented, since the 19th century its use has become increasingly rarer, following the depopulation of the farmhouse. It was closed after 1930 and used as a warehouse; now disused and once again destined for ruin, in 2020 it was damaged by vandals and, subsequently, part of the roof collapsed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The church of Madonna di Pompei is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\n\nThe church-sanctuary of Madonna di Pompei stands on the west side of Piazza Volta. The devotion to the Madonna of Pompeii in Vigevano was started by Don Ambrogio Ceriotti on 8 May 1897, taking advantage of a large room used as a wood and lime warehouse in the then suburb of the fair, at the entrance to the road to Mortara. The humble original building, a much smaller church than the current one, was replaced by a new one whose first stone was laid on 6 June 1920. The current Sanctuary, large and imposing, with three naves, was built based on the design of engineer Spirito Maria Chiappetta from Milan, who later became a priest, and is the only one completed among all his works. The church was opened for worship on 30 April 1922, being still partly rustic and of unfinished construction. The completion of the façade was carried out by Mons. Carlo Dell'Orbo, based on a design by the same architect Mons. Chiappetta and inaugurated in this beautiful art form on the evening of 7 May 1940 with the blessing of the bishop Mons. Giovanni Bargiggia.\nDon Ceriotti died in 1925, but as early as 1922 he had asked for and obtained collaboration with the church of the Somaschi Fathers; these remained there until the end of 1926 when they had to abandon Vigevano; Don Carlo Dell'Orbo was then appointed to take over the rectorship of the church and began his work in February 1927. He immediately got in touch with the architect Mons. Chiappetta, had all the cement from which the sanctuary was invaded and removed all the false constructions, and gave the desired design to the stairs, which constitute a distinctive element of the entrance.\nBased on drawings by the Vigevano painters Luigi Bocca and Carlo and Casimiro Ottone, the internal decoration was created with images of the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary (mysteries of joy, pain and glory). The stained glass windows donated by benefactors and representing figures of saints appear there.\nThe consecration of the church (1 May 1931) coincided with the 15th centenary of the proclamation of the divine motherhood of the Most Holy Mary in the Council of Ephesus (431).\nIn the following years the original building underwent a heavy architectural intervention, which gave the exterior its current appearance. The façade of the original building was extensively modified, if not almost completely rebuilt, to the point of radically changing its appearance, in particular with the insertion, as the most evident element of the intervention, of a front bell tower which stands out directly in the center of the facade on the access stairs to the sanctuary.\nAttached to the church was the Pio Istituto dei derelitti, now disappeared, opened on 24 December 1903, equipped with an active typography school. Finally, in the churchyard, in the center of a large niche on the façade, there is a bronze statue of Don Ceriotti, the work of the sculptor Secchi (1926).\nThe church was built on the ruins of an ancient church, once dedicated to San Rocco.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eusidinus, also Euzidinus or Euscidius (Hungarian: Őszöd; died 1156/1158), was a Hungarian nobleman in the first half of the 12th century.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis father was a certain Adrian. He had a brother Stephen. Eusidinus was an influential member of the royal court during the reign of Béla II of Hungary. He served as ispán of Szolnok County in 1134. He is the first known office-holder after mid-11th-century noble Szolnok, the namesake of the castle and the county. Eusidinus was styled as ispán of Fejér County in 1138.\n\n\n== Church founding ==\nEusidinus possessed lands in Bars County, for instance Barátka and Szántó (both laid in the territory of present-day Levice, Slovakia). Eusidinus built a Romanesque church in Barátka (Baratka or Bratka), dedicated to St. Martin of Tours, with three altars. He assigned three clerics and four liturgy books (missale, nocturnale, psalterium and graduale) there. The church was consecrated by Martyrius, Archbishop of Esztergom in 1156, in the presence of Eusidinus. Upon his request, the archbishop donated the villages of Barátka, Léva and Visk (today Levice and Vyškovce nad Ipľom in Slovakia) to the newly erected church, establishing its parochial area. Some historians, for instance, László Erdélyi and Richard Marsina considered Martyrius' charter (called as \"Diploma of Eusidinus\" in Hungarian historiography) as a 14th-century forgery, citing anachronistic elements in the text (e.g. the words parochia or missale). After a philological examination, Erzsébet Ladányi accepted the document as authentic.\nEusidinus died in 1157 or 1158. He had no male descendants. parsonage, through ispán Gabriel, permitted his brother Stephen to donate the estates Barátka and Szántó with the above-mentioned church to the Garamszentbenedek Abbey (present-day Hronský Beňadik, Slovakia). The single-nave church was destroyed during the first Mongol invasion of Hungary, therefore, a new church, also a Romanesque one, was built next to its ruins sometime in the middle of the 13th century. Remains of both churches were excavated by Slovak archaeologist Alojz Habovštiak between 1958 and 1960.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Indomito (English: \"Indomitable\") was an Italian Indomito-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1913, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign and seeing action in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929, she was stricken in 1937 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nIndomito was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, in 1910. She was launched on 10 May 1912 and commissioned in 1913.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Indomito, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Lodolo, and the destroyers Impavido, Impetuoso, Insidioso, Intrepido, and Irrequieto made up the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. The squadron, under the command of Capitano de fregata (Frigate Captain) P. Orsini, was based at Taranto, although either Indomito or Impetuoso or both were visiting La Spezia that day. On 9 June 1915, Indomito, Impetuoso, Insidioso, Intrepido, Irrequieto, the protected cruiser Quarto, and the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Ardito, and Audace escorted the armored cruisers  Giuseppe Garibaldi and Vettor Pisani as they participated in the bombardment of the lighthouses at the Cape of Rodon and Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of the Principality of Albania.\nOn 22 November 1915 Indomito and other ships of her squadron transported a British commissariat commission. The Italian destroyers interrupted their voyage to pursue Austro-Hungarian Navy ships that had sunk the motor sailing ship Gallinara and the steamship Palatino, but were unable to engage them.\nOn 3 December 1915 Indomito, Impetuoso , Insidioso, Intrepido, and Irrequieto got underway from Brindisi to escort one of the first supply convoys for Italian troops in Albania. As the convoy — composed of the troop transports Re Umberto and Valparaiso, carrying a total of 1,800 men and 150 draft animals — approached Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of Albania, Re Umberto, with 765 men on board, hit a mine laid by the Imperial German Navy submarine UC-14, broke in two, and sank in 15 minutes. Rescuers saved 712 men.\nOn 9 December 1915 Indomito and the destroyer Euro escorted the auxiliary ship Sterope from Taranto to Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in Albania.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\nOn 23 February 1916 Indomito, Impetuoso, Ardito, and the protected cruisers Libia and Puglia positioned themselves in the harbor at Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) in Albania to protect the withdrawal of the \"Savona\" Brigade.\nAt 21:00 on 11 December 1916 Indomito and Ardente got underway from Vlorë to escort the battleship Regina Margherita to Italy, but shortly after departure Regina Margherita hit two mines less than 2 nautical miles (3.7 km; 2.3 mi) from Vlorë, capsized, and sank in just seven minutes with the loss of 674 lives. Only 275 members of her crew were saved. Later in December 1916 Indomito underwent repairs at the Venetian Arsenal in Venice.\n\n\n==== 1917 ====\nOn the night of 14–15 May 1917, the Battle of the Strait of Otranto began when the Austro-Hungarian Navy staged a two-pronged attack against the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto aimed both at destroying naval drifters — armed fishing boats that patrolled the anti-submarine barrier the barrage formed — and, as a diversionary action, at destroying an Italian convoy bound from Italy to Albania. At 04:10 on 15 May, after receiving news of the attack, Indomito, Impavido, Insidioso, the protected cruiser Marsala, the scout cruisers Aquila and Carlo Alberto Racchia, and the British Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Liverpool made ready for sea at Brindisi. At 05:30 the formation left Brindisi together with the British light cruiser HMS Dartmouth and two other destroyers, and at 07:45 the Allied force sighted the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Balaton and Csepel. Aquila and the Italian destroyers steered to attack the two Austro-Hungarian ships at 08:10 and opened fire on them at 08:15. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire, Balaton suffered damage and Aquila was hit and immobilized immediately afterwards. The two Austro-Hungarian destroyers ultimately took shelter under the cover of Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries, forcing the Italian ships to give up the pursuit. Following a clash in which other Italian and Austro-Hungarian ships also participated, the battle ended with some ships damaged on both sides, but none sunk.\nOn 9 June 1917 Indomito, now under the command of an officer named Da Sacco, escorted a convoy of merchant ships headed to Plataria, Parga, Murzo, and Igoumenitsa in the Epirus region of Greece carrying 1,700 men, 200 draft animals, and 300 tons of supplies. On 16 July 1917 Indomito, Impavido, Insidioso, Carlo Alberto Racchia, and the scout cruiser Augusto Riboty operated in distant support of an Italian air attack against Durrës carried out by 18 aircraft flying from Brindisi and Vlorë and supported by the torpedo boats Ardea and Pegaso.\nAn Austro-Hungarian Navy force consisting of the scout cruiser Helgoland and the destroyers Balaton, Csepel, Lika, Orjen, Tatra, and Triglaw left Cattaro on 18 October 1917 to attack Italian convoys. The Austro-Hungarians found no convoys, so Heligoland and Lika moved within sight of Brindisi to entice Italian ships into chasing them and lure the Italians into an ambush by the Austro-Hungarian submarines U-32 and U-40. Indomito got underway from Brindisi with Aquila, the scout cruiser Sparviero, the destroyers Antonio Mosto and Giuseppe Missori, the British light cruisers HMS Gloucester and HMS Newcastle, and the French Navy destroyers Bisson, Commandant Bory, and Commandant Rivière to join other Italian ships in pursuit of the Austro-Hungarians, but after a long chase which also saw some Italian air attacks on the Austro-Hungarian ships all the Italian ships returned to port without damage.\n\n\n==== 1918 ====\nIndomito, the scout cruisers Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol, and the destroyer Ippolito Nievo were assigned to support a raid against Durrës on the night of 10–11 February 1918 by the motor torpedo boats MAS 9 and MAS 20, towed by the torpedo boats 37 PN and 38 PN. Bad weather forced the cancellation of the raid.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter the end of World War I, Indomito′s armament was revised, giving her five 102 mm (4 in)/35-caliber guns, a single 40 mm (1.6 in)/35-caliber gun, and four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes. She was reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929 and stricken from the naval register 11 July 1937.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Mary A. Brinkman (1846–1932) was an American homeopathic physician who specialized in gynaecology. By her training, education, acquired knowledge and natural endowments, she seemed predestined to exert a wide influence upon our era for the physical welfare of women through her lectures, medical writings, and contributions to literature. \nShe was the first woman elected to the vice-presidency of the New York State Homoopathic Medical Society.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Abby Cushing Clapp born in Hingham, Massachusetts, February 22, 1846. Her parents were Alexander and Lauritta (Lincoln) Clapp. Her ancestors came to America in 1630, and trace their lineage to the time of Edward the Confessor. They took an active part in the French and Revolutionary wars, and in the war of 1812.\nIn her youth, she acquired a common-school education as was customary for New England girls of her day. On reaching adulthood, she visited Europe, where she devoted herself to study and travel. It was at that time her thoughts were first turned to the study of medicine. Believing that women physicians were demanded by the times, she determined to join the medical profession. Soon after returning to the U.S., in 1871, she entered as a student the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women. At her graduation, three years later, she was chosen the valedictorian of her class, and her medical thesis, which was a part of the final examination, was published in the North American Journal of Homeopathy and attracted considerable attention.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter receiving her diploma, she continued to take instruction in the clinical department of the hospital, under private tuition, but was almost immediately chosen instructor in diseases of children. From that time, she continuously occupied one or another of the college chairs, averaging for half the year two lectures a week.In 1874 she was appointed lecturer on diseases of children in the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, holding this position until 1881, when she accepted the chair of gynæcology in the same institution, an honor then first accorded to a woman. In 1889, illness compelled her to resign, and she became consulting physician to the hospital in gynæcology. The work was without compensation, but in doing it, Brinkman was ministering to poor women and also, as she believed contributing to form a public opinion which would open more avenues of usefulness to women.In 1881, she was chosen professor of diseases of women (gynaecology) in the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women. The trustees were slow to award the honors of the profession to women, even in a woman's college, and Brinkman was among the first to hold such a position. She filled it with success until forced by ill health to resign it, in 1889. Meanwhile, she held other positions, being appointed, in 1886, visiting physician on the medical staff of the New York College for Women, and in 1880, consulting physician to the hospital.She did a vast amount of gratuitous work for the needy, and labored to improve the condition and advance the cause of women,. Among these good works were the lectures she gave before women's clubs and societies. Another of her beneficent labors was the course of lectures she delivered on medical subjects to the young women of the Girls' Friendly Society of St. Thomas, St. James, and Calvary Churches, in New York City. As associate member of the Girls' Friendly Society of the Episcopal Church she did active work. In connection with this may be mentioned the Bible talks to workmen gathered from the streets, which from week to week, for one entire year, she gave under the auspices of the Galilee Mission of Calvary Church, which mission she helped to organize. These lectures were a decided aid in the progress of woman's work in the church, and as an object lesson to the uncultivated working men, they undoubtedly led to their holding their wives in higher esteem and treating them with more consideration.Brinkman was an active member of many State and county societies, both medical and philanthropic, among which were the New York State and County Medical Societies, the Christian League for Promoting Social Purity, the New York Woman Suffrage Society, and the Society for Promoting the Welfare of the Insane. This gratuitous labor for the public was the more noticeable from the fact that, during the greater part of the time in which it was done, she cared for a large and constantly increasing private practice.Brinkman wrote articles for the medical journals which extended her reputation among the profession. In her special line of work, gynaecology, she was an authority. She used her leisure time in literary work. Her style was clear and marked by terseness, euphony and impressiveness. On the subject in which she was most interested, the physical education of young women, she wrote articles for the North American Review and other leading journals, which attracted wide attention.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1875, she married James George Waddell Brinkman, who was born in Augusta, Maine, in 1837, but who, since childhood, was a resident of New York City. In 1894, the Brinkmans came to live in Putnam County, New York, Mr. Brinkman having charge of the city property and works at Double Reservoir I, near Brewster village. This change of residence made it necessary for her to give up the active practice of medicine in New York City.Dr. Mary A. Brinkman died January 25, 1932, at St. Luke's Home for Aged Women. Burial was at Milltown Rural Cemetery, Brewster, New York.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n1889, \"Gynaecological Résumé\", Homoeopathic Journal of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Paedology, Volume 11\n1890, \"A Talk Suggested by Every Day Practice\", The North American Journal of Homeopathy, Volume 38\n1913, \"Imagination\", Washington News Letter, Volume 19\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Mary A.

        "content": "The church of Madonna della Santa Casa di Loreto is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChurch built during the plague of 1524 in Vigevano, it is smaller than San Cristoforo, built in the same period.\nIt was built at the behest of a certain friar Domenico, belonging to the order of friars minor, who claimed to have seen the Virgin, who would have asked to build a church to stop the epidemic. Around the church, dedicated to the Madonna of Loreto, a convent was built in 1539, entrusted to the Capuchin friars. After having enlarged and remodeled it in 1553 and 1568, in 1603 the Capuchin friars moved to the church of Cristo della Resega, leaving the building in the hands of the third Franciscan order.\nGiven the slow degradation of the church, Monsignor Pietro Giorgio Odescalchi, bishop of Vigevano, decided to build the current one. The first stone, a brick from the room in which Saint Charles Borromeo was born, was blessed by him on 3 May 1613 and was placed by Philip of Austria. The altar was built by the bishop himself in those years. The first mass was sung by the bishop on 8 September 1619, after the altar was brought from the bishopric to the new church in a great procession. In Milan a statue of the Madonna of Loreto was built with dimensions similar to the original one and was carried in triumph to Vigevano. Behind the altar the heart of Bishop Odescalchi was buried.\nThe convent was abandoned in 1653 following a papal bull from Pope Innocent X. After management by the Vigevano Seminary, the building was definitively suppressed by Napoleon in 1805. Since then the church has suffered a slow decline, despite some rescue attempts in the 1930s.\nToday it is privately owned. It is located on the corner of Via Ippocrate and Strada Camina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kiso 5639 (also known as LEDA 36252, KUG 1138+327 or the Skyrocket Galaxy) is an irregular dwarf galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major, approximately 85 million light-years from Earth. It has an elongated and flattened shape, with a maximum diameter that extends for approximately 2,700 light years. The new stars are distributed in about ten groups and have a mass corresponding to about one million solar masses. This intense activity also corresponds to the presence of areas in which the matter is rarefied, which were probably formed following a combination of stellar winds and supernovae explosions. The starburst of the galaxy is believed to have occurred around one million years ago.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nKiso 5639 has been referred to the, Skyrocket Galaxy, which is informally named as such due to it being described as a \"July 4th skyrocket\" by NASA. It has also been informally called the Rocket Galaxy due to its \"trail\" structure and brightness at the head.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nKiso 5639 has an extremely irregular shape. At the head is an intense concentration of stars compared to the rest of the galaxy, such that it takes on that resembles that of a tadpole. This area of ​​high intensity is determined by the presence of abundant concentrations of hydrogen gas and intense star formation activity. The galaxy has an elongated and flattened \"pancake\" shape, with a maximum diameter that extends for approximately 2,700 light years. \n\n\n== Discovery ==\nKiso 5639 was discovered in 2004 using the Hubble Space Telescope, and was further observed in February and July of 2015 with the Wide Field Camera 3.\n\n\n== Star formation ==\nFaint areas of star formation are present in other parts of the galaxy, with stellar elements ranging in age from several million to a few billion years. These data were collected from observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope during 2015 and were published in The Astrophysical Journal. The starburst is believed to have begun approximately one million years ago following the galaxies' encounter with a filament of intergalactic gas. The new stars in the galaxy are distributed in about ten groups and have a mass corresponding to about one million solar masses.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of galaxies\nGalaxy formation and evolution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nElmegreen, Bruce G.; Herrera, Cinthya; Rubio, Monica; Elmegreen, Debra Meloy; Almeida, Jorge Sánchez; Muñoz-Tuñón, Casiana; Olmo-Garcia, A.

        "content": "Enrique Meneses (October 21, 1929 – January 9, 2013) was a Spanish journalist, photographer, author, and director. Meneses is most famous for his 1958 Paris Match photo essay covering Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and the Cuban Revolution.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEnrique Meneses was born in Madrid on October 21, 1929. Meneses spent his childhood and school years in Madrid until the Spanish Civil War broke out. His family was able to move to Biarritz, France, until it came under Nazi occupation in 1940. The Meneses family was again forced to move eventually settling in Estoril, Portugal.\nThe Meneses family was upper class heir to a multi-million dollar silver metal casting factory founded by Leonacio Meneses. With some of his inheritance Enrique's father published his magazine Cosmópolis, then opening a news agency Prensa Mundial. Meneses spent time around the office of Prensa Mundial meeting and being influenced by many journalists.\nThrough the encouragement of his father, Meneses studied Law at the University of Salamanca in an attempt to pursue a diplomatic career but ended up dropping out to found his first press agency. \n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nMeneses did his first reporting at age 17 when he covered the death of Spanish bullfighter Manolete. Despite the financial setback of spending more on transportation than his earnings from the assignment, the experience solidified a conviction to explore the world in pursuit of stories. \nAfter declining journalism scholarship at Stanford University in 1951, opting instead to accept a position with Reader's Digest Meneses traveled around Europe reporting and learning different languages. After depleting his savings in 1954 Meneses received money from his mother and made a permanent move to Cairo, Egypt. While in Cairo, Meneses became a contributor to several foreign newspapers and traveled all across Africa.\nMeneses would become employed by the weekly French magazine publication Paris Match, after being referred for the job by his long-time mentor and Shahrokh Hatami. This lead him to his first big reporting opportunity covering the Suez Canal Crisis in 1956. After arriving in Egypt he informed the other journalists he was headed to the front lines and hailed a taxi that took him to the fighting between Isreali and Egyptian troops. While covering the fighting two of his colleagues Magnum's David Semour and Paris Match's Jean Roy were killed in close proximity to Meneses by Egyptian gunfire.\nDuring this period Meneses established himself as a photographer with little interest in creating images with a stylistic or aesthetic tone opting instead for a more robust voiceless photojournalistic style. Spanish photographer and photo editor Chema Conesa describes his work as if his camera were as rudimentary as a pencil with its only ability to focus the gaze on a fact or event.\n\n\n=== Cuban Revolution ===\nA 28-year-old Meneses ran away with his 19-year-old first cousin in 1957 to escape an arranged marriage she was to be subjected to. Eventually becoming romantic with her they traveled around France, Switzerland, and Germany before she was taken by police in Belgium and returned to her mother. She was sent to Costa Rica to live with her father, a newly appointed diplomat to the country. Meneses followed by getting Paris Match to send him to Cuba to cover the construction of the Havana Tunnel by a French company. The plan was after the assignment he would travel to Costa Rica to reconnect with his cousin.\nWhile assigning the Havana Tunnel story, Paris Match Editor Dedé Lacaze informed Meneses that he was interested in the bubbling Cuban revolution plot to overthrow Cuban president Fulgencio Batista. Lacaze requested if Meneses was able to get images of the revolutionaries in addition he would be thrilled. While in the air traveling to Cuba Meneses learned that the Cuban National Army were surrounding revolution leader Fidel Castro. Meneses dropped the original assignment and headed for the Siera Maestra to find the revolutionaries.\nParis Match had no resources in Cuba so Meneses was on his own to find the revolutionaries and stay out of trouble. To avoid being detected by Cuban police and military Meneses hid his cameras in a box filled with bottles of whiskey, flew on the worst possible airline and took busses not taxi services. Many other reporters were stopped by Cuban officials when they were identified as press. Meneses was eventually guided up the Siera Maestra to revolutionaries, evading the military checkpoints and becoming the first reporter to reach Fidel Castro. On arrival Che Guevara hung a sign reading \"International Press Club\" on the door of Meneses bohío where he would live for the next ten months.\nDuring Meneses time in the Siera Maestra he photographed the daily life of Fidel Castro and the 26th of July Movement. Meneses dove deep into the movement's relationship with the peasants and their leader Crescencio Perez who guided them in the mountain. Meneses was able to show a remarkably intimate look at the operation including the during the Battle of Pino del Agua. He also made some of the only known photographs of Che Guevara in the Siera Maestra mountains.\nOver his time with the guerrillas Meneses cultivated a relationship with Fidel Castro, who was interested in what he had experienced documenting Suez Canal Crisis. Castro often asked about how Gamal Abdel Nasser had redistributed land, built cooperative farming units and resisted the Isreali counterinsurgency. Meneses scoffed at the assertion that any of this would work, sharing in his writing that he saw Nasser's attempts as an utter failure and a total utopian dream.\nOnce the project was nearing completion the logistical hurdle of getting Meneses' negatives out of Cuba began. To avoid detection from the Batista government he had his negatives sewn inside of a petticoat belonging to the youngest daughter of Colonel Ferrer who was able to deliver them undetected. When the Batista police caught wind of this they detained and interrogated Meneses until Spanish ambassador, Juan Pablo de Lojendio e Irure, intervened to have him expelled from Cuba.\nParis Match published the images spread over three issues, on March 8, 1958, April 12, 1958 and April 19, 1958. Meneses would be paid 3,000,000 Spanish pesetas from Paris Match for his 11 months of work and an additional $50,000 (equivalent to $528,028 in 2023) from CBS. \nThough Meneses was sympathetic to the Cuban revolutionaries at the time of photographing them, his retrospective writings became increasingly critical of the movement and of Fidel Castro. Meneses also received criticism from multiple scholarly journals in relation to his reporting in his retrospective book Fidel Castro: Siete Años de Poder. Academics believed that Meneses created a superficial account with limited details on significant events in his book. Academics also believed the characterization of Castro and Guevara in the book appeared inconsistent with the established historical precedent.\n\n\n== Published books ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Piscine tuberculosis (piscine mycobacteriosis or fish tuberculosis) is a chronic infectious disease that afflicts many species of fish. This disease is caused by members of the Mycobacterium genus and can afflict marine, brackish, and freshwater fish. Piscine mycobacteriosis has been known to affect over 200 species of fish and is a major cause of mortality in ornamental and farmed fish. \n\n\n== Cause ==\nPiscine mycobacteriosis is caused by acid-fast bacilli colloquially referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). These are pleomorphic Gram-positive bacteria found ubiquitously in the environment. The most common causes of piscine mycobacteriosis are M. marinum, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum.\n\n\n== Disease ==\nPiscine tuberculosis is a common disease in fish and has been reported in aquaria, laboratories, commercial fish farms, and wild populations. It is considered to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in fish.\n\n\n=== Signs and symptoms ===\nPiscine mycobacteriosis often presents as a chronic disease, with affected fish surviving for several weeks to years. Signs are variable and nonspecific; they can include emaciation, ascites, skin ulceration, hemorrhages, paleness, and skeletal deformities. Granulomatous inflammation may be found throughout internal organs and muscles and all tissues of the fish may be involved.\n\n\n=== Transmission ===\nFish can acquire mycobacteria through the ingestion of contaminated feed or of infected dead fish. Transmission can also occur through contact with affected lesions or through the gills.\n\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\nA presumptive diagnosis can be made upon the visualization of acid-fast bacilli within granulomatous material from lesions. Sensitivity for acid-fast staining is low, granulomas containing no visible acid-fast bacilli are reported in many experimentally infected species of fish.\nA definitive diagnosis requires the isolation and identification of the bacteria. Culture involves inoculating tissue samples onto Middlebrook 7H10, Lowenstein-Jensen, or another form of laboratory media. Culture-based detection of Mycobacterium spp. is complicated by the presence of bacterial flora that compete with Mycobacterium on standard laboratory media. The isolation of Mycobacterium from feces, external surfaces, and whole viscera is questionable.\n\n\n== Treatment and control ==\nThere is currently no widely accepted treatment for mycobacteriosis in fish. Treatment is infrequently attempted as it appears ineffective at eliminating Mycobacterium from affected colonies and is not practical in fish intended as food. Treating the fish with antibiotics has been reported to fail even when despite in vitro susceptibility being observed. Control of piscine mycobacteriosis may necessitate the destruction of all affected stocks and disinfection of tanks and plumbing.\nThe Ag85A DNA vaccine was shown to provide short term immunity in striped bass against M. marinum, but it was unsuccessful at achieving long-term immunity.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Population Balance (formerly World Population Balance) is a non-profit organization in the United States that raises awareness of the connections between pronatalism, human supremacy, social inequalities, and ecological overshoot, and advocates for solutions to address their combined impacts on the planet, people, and animals. \n\n\n== History and background ==\nPopulation Balance was founded by David Paxson as World Population Balance in 1993. In 2021 Nandita Bajaj became executive director and the organization adopted its current name of Population Balance. Notable past and present advisors include Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Borlaug, former Governor of Michigan William Milliken, originator of the \"ecological footprint\" concept William E. Rees, actress and activist Alexandra Paul, and physicist Albert Allen Bartlett.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n\n=== Tagline ===\nShrink Toward Abundance\n\n\n=== Vision ===\nPopulation Balance envisions a future where human's footprint is in balance with life on Earth, enabling all species to thrive.\n\n\n=== Mission ===\nPopulation Balance's mission is to inspire narrative, behavioral, and system change that shrinks our human impact and elevates the rights and wellbeing of people, animals, and the planet. \n\n\n=== Approach ===\nPopulation Balance is the only organization globally that uses a humane education lens to address ecological overshoot by advocating for solutions that elevate social, ecological, and intergenerational justice. Their pillars are:\n\nBeyond pronatalism toward liberated choices: Empowering people to make liberated and informed choices for themselves, their families, and the planet, including adopting broader understandings of “family” with our human and nonhuman kin.\nBeyond human supremacy toward ecocentrism: Advocating for a radical shift in our relationship with all animals and with the entire natural world: from one of domination and exploitation, to one of reverence, justice, and care.\nBeyond social inequalities toward social justice: Challenging the unjust and growth-driven social, political, and economic systems that exploit and disempower human communities and threaten all life on Earth.    \n\n\n== Activities ==\nPopulation Balance uses the humane education framework for its outreach activities that help draw the connections between pronatalism, overpopulation, human supremacy, and ecological collapse and promote urgently needed solutions. Activities include The Overpopulation Podcast, classroom and conference presentations, academic and media publications, and media and podcast interviews.\n\n\n=== The Overpopulation Podcast ===\nThe Overpopulation Podcast is released twice monthly and is ranked in the top 2% of podcasts globally. The podcast hosts interview expert guests to explore the drivers and impacts of ecological overshoot as well as individual and collective solutions. Notable guests have included Mechai Viravaidya, Riane Eisler, Paul Ehrlich, Alan Weisman, Naomi Oreskes, William E. Rees, Angela Saini, Partha Dasgupta, Carl Safina, Richard Heinberg, Orna Donath, Robert Jensen, Jo-Anne McArthur, Robert Engelman, Malcolm Potts, Alexandra Paul, Kevin Bales, and Vegard Skirbekk.\n\n\n=== Academic publications ===\nPopulation Balance staff make regular contributions in academic publications on the subjects of ecological overshoot, pronatalism, and critical animal studies, and in 2024 co-authored a World Scientists' Warning to Humanity paper.\n\n\n=== Media appearances ===\nPopulation Balance’s work has appeared in a variety of media, including The Globe and Mail, National Post, CBC Radio, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Ms. Magazine, Newsweek, The Christian Science Monitor, Truthdig, CounterPunch, Inter Press Service, Wisconsin Public Radio, and Radio Paradise.\n\n\n=== Charity evaluation ===\nPopulation Balance has a 4-star rating through Charity Navigator and a Platinum transparency rating through Candid (Guidestar).\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site: Population Balance\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kurt Cobain: Moments That Shook Music is a BBC documentary that first aired on April 13, 2024, in the United Kingdom to mark the 30th anniversary of the death of Kurt Cobain who was the lead singer and guitarist of American rock band Nirvana.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe documentary first aired on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer on April 13, 2024, to mark the 30th anniversary of the death of the Nirvana lead singer and guitarist who committed suicide in April 1994. It was directed and written by John Osborne. The aim of the documentary was to demystify the death of Cobain using archive footage. A press release stated that the documentary will be \"told exclusively through powerful and rare archive footage\", delivering a \"visceral account of the days that surrounded the tragic moment\" when Kurt Cobain took his own life. Some of the archive footage had never been seen before on British TV. The only Nirvana music to feature in the film are cover versions of songs written by other people. There is a mention of how Nirvana's Nevermind album knocked Michael Jackson's Dangerous off the number 1 spot on the Billboard 200 album chart. It is also mentioned that the day after Cobain's body was found president Bill Clinton asked Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder if he should address the nation on it but that Vedder advised against it. There is an interview with the electrician who found Cobain's body on the morning of April 8, 1994. The documentary includes footage of Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, reading his final letter that was played to a crowd at his vigil in Seattle and also an interview with Cobain himself. The documentary ends with the legacy of the band finally being acknowledged but in sales, chart positions and awards.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Guardian rated the documentary three out of five stars, with Rebecca Nicholson stating that \"But other than that interview, Cobain is largely absent: the moment that shook music, for this film, is not his life and work, but his death. Fair enough, I suppose, if that is the brief\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Last 48 Hours of Kurt Cobain, BBC documentary from 2006.\nWhen Nirvana Came to Britain, BBC documentary from 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"BBC Music Remembers Kurt Cobain with range of programmes across the BBC\". bbc.com.

        "content": "Lonka Korzybrodska (1917–1943) was a member of the Jewish resistance in Poland during the Second World War. She adopted a Christian Polish identity, allowing her to work as a courier, smuggling messages, documents and money between resistance groups based in ghettos in Poland. On a mission to Warsaw, she was captured and imprisoned. After suffering months of torture and starvation, she was transferred to Birkenau, part of Auschwitz. She worked there as a translator but caught Typhus fever and died in March 1943.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKorzybrodska was born in 1917 in Pruszków, on the western edge of Warsaw. Her father Avraham was a teacher, with a reputation for inspiring many of his pupils to become involved in pioneer youth movements. Lonka was educated in Polish schools and joined a Polish socialist youth group. She learned a wide range of languages, including Polish, Hebrew, Yiddish, German, French, English, Ukrainian and Russian.\n\n\n== Activist ==\n\nKorzybroska's elder brother David held a senior position in the HeHalutz/Dror movement and this led to her joining the movement as well. Once the Germans had occupied Poland, Kozybrodska volunteered to be a courier, due to her \"Aryan\" appearance. She adopted a Polish Christian identity, going by the name Kristina Kosowska. She travelled between the various large cities, carrying messages, documents, money, weapons and instructions between the resistance groups. Her knowledge of languages made it easy for her to deal with the various nationalities that she encountered during this work. She was often accompanied by Yitzhak Zuckerman, known as \"Antek\". Zuckerman later said of her that she was born for the role.\nLate in December 1941 she and Tema Schneiderman were staying with their fellow courier Bela Hazan in Grodno, where she worked at the Gestapo headquarters. When Hazan was invited to the Gestapo Christmas party, Kozybrodska and Schneiderman found themselves being invited too, an occasion that resulted in a photograph being taken by one of the Gestapo officers, entirely unaware of their true identities. In January 1942 Kozybrodska travelled to Vilna (then part of Poland, now in Lithuania), to look into reports of a massacre at Ponary (now Paneria).\n\n\n== Imprisonment ==\n\nIn April 1942, on another mission to Warsaw, she was arrested in possession of four revolvers at Malkinia railway station. She was sent to the notorious Pawiak prison, where she was starved and tortured. In June 1942, Hazan, who was sent to locate her once she had lost touch with the resistance, was captured in similar fashion, also ending up in Pawiak prison. Eventually the two were placed in the same cell, allowing them to reconnect. Hazan described her at that time as pale, emaciated and hard to recognise. Both Korzybrodska and Hazan managed to maintain their \"Polish\" identities, befriending other Polish inmates. From the prison yard, Korzybrodska threw notes into the neighbouring street, at least one of which was relayed back to Zuckerman.\nKorzybrodska and Hazan, with 51 others, were transferred to Birkenau, part of Auschwitz, in November 1942. After a short period of hard labour in the fields, Korzybrodska's language skills were noticed and she found work as an interpreter in the camp office. In 1943, Korzybrodska and Hazan both caught Typhoid fever. Hazan recovered but Korzybrodska, who had also contracted mumps and dysentry, died aged 26 in her friend's arms. Hazan persuaded an SS doctor to let her take her friend's body to the morgue, where she recited the Kaddish.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Killeenagarriff (Irish: Cill Mhic Con Ghairbh, meaning \"church of the son of Cú Garbh\") is a civil parish in the historical barony of Clanwilliam in County Limerick, Ireland. Settlements in Killeenagarriff include the town of Annacotty, and population centres at Ahane and Barringtonsbridge.\nThe Roman Catholic church at Ahane, built in the mid-1830s and dedicated to Saint Patrick, was described in Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) as a \"large new chapel\". Its construction is reputed to contain a doorcase \"reclaimed\" from the ruins of Quin Abbey in neighbouring County Clare. Thornfield House, also in Ahane and dating from at least the early 19th century, was the home of General Richard Bourke, who retired there after a term as Governor of New South Wales in Australia.\nBarringtonsbridge, which spans into the neighbouring parish of Clonkeen, is a small settlement which developed near a metal bridge. This metal bridge was built, by the Barrington family, in the early 19th century over the Killeengarriff River.\nKilleenagarriff Church, a small ruined medieval church in Killeenagarriff townland, is sited in a churchyard which is bounded by the Killeengarriff River. The Killeenagarriff River later joins the Mulkear River.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClonkeen Church (near Barringtonsbridge in neighbouring Clonkeen parish)\n\n\n== References ==",

The area has been inhabited since Roman times; in 2007 archaeologists discovered the remains of a large Roman villa in Solre-sur-Sambre. The village church, dedicated to Saint Medardus, is partially medieval and has tracery windows from the 13th century. There is also a 15th-century chapel in the village. The Solre-sur-Sambre Castle traces its origins to the 12th century, and is a well-preserved medieval fortress.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Solre-sur-Sambre at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The Casa de los Gobernadores (Spanish for \"House of the Governors\") is a mansion that was originally built to serve as the official residence of the Governor of California, located in Carmichael, California, in Greater Sacramento. Today, it serves as a private residence.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of Casa de los Gobernadores lie in 1967, when a group of citizens raised $200,000 to acquire the land as a prospective site for a new governor's mansion. Amongst the donors were Leonard Firestone and Holmes Tuttle. The Carmichael property was subsequently conveyed to the Government of California by grant deed in 1969.In 1970, the California Legislature designated the property as the site of the future governor's mansion. In 1972, the legislature budgeted $150,00 for preliminary plans for the mansion and $1.3 million for the construction of the building. The mansion began construction in 1974 and was completed in 1975, during the term of Governor Ronald Reagan.Reagan never resided in the mansion as it was completed after his term ended. Reagan's successor, Governor Jerry Brown, opted not to live in the newly-completed mansion.In 1982, the property was put up for sale by Governor Brown's administration. However, Brown's successor, Governor George Deukmejian, expressed interest in living at the mansion when he became governor in January 1983, which led to the property being withdrawn from sale. However, pressure from the legislature led to the sale of the mansion in late 1983; it is now a private residence with no connection to the Government of California.In 2004, Arnold Schwarzenegger, shortly after being elected governor, explored the possibility of repurchasing the property to serve as the official governor's residence, but ultimately decided to commute to Sacramento via private jet from Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCasa de los Gobernadores is a one-story, hacienda-style mansion, with 17 rooms, including a master suite, four bedrooms, library, living room, dining room, recreation areas, and guest quarters. The house is 11,984 square feet and located on an 11.3 acre parcel with a view of the American River.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernor of California\nGovernor's Mansion State Historic Park\nStanford Mansion\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Since 30 September 2014, it is a tehsil of the Pithoragarh district, which was constituted from 114 villages earlier part of Berinag and Didihat tehsil.\n\n\n== History ==\nThal is among the oldest towns in Pithoragarh district. It has been a centre for local trade for nearby settlements at Didihat, Munsiari, Chaukori and Dharamghar since antiquity. There is a 9th century Shiva temple located on the bank of Ramganga river, which was built under the patronage of Katyuri kings. Baleshwar form of Lord Shiva is worshiped in this temple. At the time of Bikhaut Sankranti, an 8-day fair used to be held here, which amassed a gathering of around 15,000 people in 1911. \nThal was connected by a motor road with Almora in 1955 and in 1957, the then UP government opened a Community development block office in Thal. There were 600 villages under this development block. The development block continued functioning till 1962, after which the government closed this development block office and divided the villages falling in Thal development block into Didihat and Berinag development blocks.

        "content": "\"Fortnight\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift featuring the American rapper and singer Post Malone. The two artists wrote the track with Jack Antonoff, who produced it with Swift. Republic Records released the song as the lead single from Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19, 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe friendship between Swift and Malone dates back to 2018, when they first met backstage at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards and shared their admiration for each other, with Swift praising Malone's song \"Better Now\" (2018) in particular. On October 27, 2023, Malone revealed that they had previously hung out together and went on to commend her as a person as well as her songwriting abilities. Ahead of its release, their collaboration was widely seen as a natural fit, with Malone \"pivoting into a country music career\" at the time and Swift having roots in the genre.\nFollowing the announcement of The Tortured Poets Department during Swift's Grammy speech on February 5, she revealed \"Fortnight\" as the opening track of the tracklist shortly thereafter. Malone turned out to be one of only two guest appearances on the album. The following day, he took to his Instagram to share his excitement about the release and the collaboration. During an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1, the singer complimented Swift and described her as \"amazing\" and \"talented\". According to him, Swift initiated the collaboration by simply \"hitting him up\". He then \"rolled in the studio\" and hung out with her, having a \"good day\" together. At the time of the interview, Malone revealed that he had not heard the full song yet.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Fortnight\" is an 1980s-influenced downtempo electropop track. The lyrics are about a woman's account of how she becomes a neighbor of an ex-lover, who is now married to another woman (\"Your wife waters the flowers/ I want to kill her\").\n\n\n== Music video ==\nSwift wrote and directed the music video for \"Fortnight\", with cinematography handled by Rodrigo Prieto. Four hours prior to the album's release, Swift posted a teaser for the music video on social media, which featured both artists \"typing furiously away at a dystopic, snow-white office, before cutting to a clip of Swift strapped onto a strange contraption. Also spliced in is a snippet of Malone and Swift hugging in the middle of a highway with Swift draped in a black dress surrounded by burning pieces of paper.\"\n\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nThe music video was released on April 19, 2024 at 8 PM, featuring Swift, Malone, and actors Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles. The video is in black and white and draws influences from silent films of the early 20th century.\nThe video starts off in a mental facility. Swift, donning a torn white wedding dress, is chained to her bed positioned on the ceiling, seemingly defying gravity. She is given medication and is consequently allowed to walk freely around her room; as she stares at her reflection in a one-way mirror, she wipes her face off, revealing tattoos. She walks through a doorway and into her memories; now wearing a black, Victorian-era mourning dress, she recalls working in a sterile office environment filled with workers dressed in head-to-toe black, perpetually typing \"I love you, it's ruining my life\" on a typewriter opposite her coworker, played by Malone. It is later revealed the two are lovers. Back at the mental facility, psychologists and medical professionals, played by Hawke, Charles, and Malone, conduct experiments on Swift, who is strapped to a gurney. Hawke pulls a lever, electrocuting Swift, causing machines to spark and malfunction. Malone, who realizes who she really is, pulls the plug and delivers Swift from her pain. The final scenes depict Malone, soaking wet from rain, in a telephone booth situated on a lone cliff; Swift, looking on from up above the structure, grasps Malone's extended hand, symbolizing their reunification at long last.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits are adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1607 the brotherhood of Death settled there. It was then restored in 1728 and 1842, adding new paintings. There are four altars, dedicated respectively to Our Lady of Caravaggio, to St. Filippo Benizi, to St. Anthony and to the Saints Crispin and Crispinian.Inside, in Baroque style, there is a fresco on the vault which houses architectural backgrounds of great scenographic effect. The main altar has the Virgin between Saints Roch and Sebastian in the center, of the Lombard school. The child plays with the cat, in the arms of the Madonna who wears a blue cloak with small flowers, closed with a clasp. She is sitting on a niche-shaped wooden throne. The black and white checkered floor. In the background a bright red band and above the blue sky against which the refined shapes of the faces stand out. To her right, Saint Roch, with his yellow and red doublet, and the pilgrim's cloak. On the left, the beautiful body pierced by the arrows of Saint Sebastian. The portal is enriched by a baroque frieze in red Verona marble with black inserts.\nThe bell tower on the side in baroque style contrasts with the linearity of the church.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The sixth season of the American reality competition streaming series The Circle premiered on Netflix on April 17, 2024. Michelle Buteau returned as host. Players compete without ever actually meeting in person; they communicate through a simulated social media interface, portraying themselves in any way they choose.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe players move into the same apartment building. However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially designed social media app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as catfishing.\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"Influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the Influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process – varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the Influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and US$100,000.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and release ===\nThe season was announced in November 2023 when Netflix renewed The Circle for a sixth and seventh season. Michelle Buteau, who hosted the first five seasons, returned for the sixth.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\nThe contestants were announced on April 16, 2024.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Results and elimination ==\nColor key\n  The contestant was blocked.\n  The contestant was an influencer.\n  The contestant was immune from being blocked.\n\nNotes\n^Note 1:  Instead of the influencers blocking one player, they each had the power to pick between two players to join the game. Brandon picked Quori-Tyler and Lauren picked Max.\n^Note 2:  The players were tasked with rating who they thought was most to least human in the game. Myles was voted most human, and had to block the player he thought was the least human.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "I Become Small and Go is the debut album by the American band Creeper Lagoon, released in 1998. The band promoted it by touring with Versus and Rocket from the Crypt. The first single was \"Wonderful Love\". \"Empty Ships\" appeared on the soundtrack to the film Dead Man on Campus.\n\n\n== Production ==\nFounding members Sharky Laguana and Ian Sefchick, who had played in a high school band in Ohio, recruited a drummer and bass player through a want ad prior to the recording sessions. John King, of the Dust Brothers and Creeper Lagoon's label, NickelBag, remixed \"Empty Ships\", \"Dear Deadly\", and \"Wonderful Love\". In addition to employing sampling, the band used a long list of toy and found instruments.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nTrouser Press dismissed the album as \"by-the-numbers contemporary alterna-pop for listeners who’ve never heard any.\" The Washington Post wrote that \"singer-guitarist Ian Sefchick and guitarist-keyboardist Sharky Laguana compose melancholy ballads that suggest such elegantly downbeat rock composers as Mark Eitzel ('Wonderful Love') and John Cale ('Second Chance').\" Spin determined that, \"aesthetically, they're between indie-jangle and art-pop, floating in space between the Matadorian arch-intelligentsia and the miniaturists of the Elephant 6 collective.\" The New York Times stated that the band \"turns the kind of noise that sounds like it came from inside someone's brain into achingly pretty, unraveling ballads.\"\nMusic Week said that \"Creeper Lagoon track a thoughtful, textured path through My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 territory.\" The Boston Globe labeled the album \"a pleasant blur of folk-pop melody, noisy guitar workouts, sampled strings, and Bulgarian chants.\" The Oakland Tribune concluded that, \"live, this band motors along nicely on charisma and an edgy attitude, but this record tries too hard to finesse weak material.\" The Rocket deemed it \"basic, ready-for-airplay smooth pop-rock.\"\nAllMusic opined that, \"without King's distinctive touch, tracks like 'Tracy' and 'Second Chance' seem stunted and colorless.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Originally published in French before it was translated to English by the author, it won the 2006 Prix Femina and was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt and Women's Prize for Fiction.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe novel is a family history divided into four quarters. A six-year-old child narrates each quarter and each narrator is a member of the same family. The narrative runs backwards, explaining the history of the family. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nFault Lines received mixed feedback from critics. Joanna Briscoe's review in The Guardian was mixed, stating that Fault Lines was impressive but \"utterly fails to move\" and calling it an \"accomplished novel whose soul is missing\".\nWriting in the The New York Times, Susann Cokal criticised the book's prose style but praised its perspectives.\nThe Jewish Book Council described Fault Lines as \"masteful, complex, and creative\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOriginally published in French under the name Lignes de Faille, Fault Lines won the 2006 Prix Femina and was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt. Following its translation into English, Fault Lines was shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction in 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shira Banki's Way (דרך שירה בנקי) is a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote moderation and discourse in Israeli society. The organization was established by the parents of Shira Banki, who was murdered at the Jerusalem gay pride parade in 2015.Shira Banki's parents lit a torch on Israel's Independence Day in 2022 for their work.\n\n\n== Shira Banki ==\nOn July 30, 2015, 15-year-old Shira Banki, from Jerusalem, was one of six attendees at the Jerusalem gay pride parade who was stabbed by Yishai Schlissel. Schlissel had been previously convicted for attempted murder at the 2005 Jerusalem pride parade, and had been recently released. Banki died at the hospital from her injuries, and Schlissel received life in prison for her murder.\n\n\n== History ==\nSeveral months after Banki's murder, her parents, Mika and Uri, both of whom were lawyers, decided to found Shira Banki's Way in honor of their daughter.In 2019, the organization co-sponsored dialogue circles in Tel Aviv following the fast day of Tisha B'Av.During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, many of the organization's events were cancelled or held on Zoom.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Another Story ===\nThe organization, in collaboration with Yuval Malchi, created the podcast \"Another Story - In Memory of Shira Banki\", which tells the stories of exceptional historical figures who acted for the sake of the \"other\". The series has 16 episodes.\n\n\n=== Dialogue Circles - \"Meeting Point\" ===\nThe organization holds dialogue circles between different groups in the Israeli population with the aim of promoting a discourse of tolerance and familiarity between different publics in Israel. Additionally, the \"Managing Conflict in Israeli Society\" project was established in collaboration with the Yitzhak Rabin Center and the Kativ Center, aimed at 10th grade students from various sectors, with the goal of bringing together youth from different backgrounds to strengthen the understanding that conflict in society should be managed through listening, emphasizing common elements, and recognizing the legitimate existence of disagreements.\n\n\n=== Clinic for Combating Hate in the Public Sphere ===\nThe organization established the Clinic for Combating Hate in the Public Sphere, in collaboration with the Berl Katznelson Foundation and the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. The clinic deals with legal, psychological, cultural and social aspects of hate speech, violence and delegitimization of groups in society, and publishes position papers and legislative proposals to promote tolerance. Its goal is to make the fight against racism a broader public issue. The clinic operates the Center for Combating Hate, which centralizes the clinic's activities and serves as an address for victims of online violence, allowing anonymous reporting. The Clinic also offers \"victims of incitement and racism\" pro bono legal aid.\n\n\n=== The Shira Program for Girls ===\nThe Shira Program for Girls is a mentoring program for girls aged 17-24 who have experienced difficult situations and distress. The program operates with a feminist approach.  \nIt was established in 2015 and is managed by the Department of Projects of the Youth Advancement Division at the Jerusalem Municipality, in partnership with \"Shira Banki Way\" which promotes educational-value activities in the public sphere.\n\n\n=== Teachers' Room - This is Jerusalem ===\nThe organization participates in a multi-sectoral teacher training program regarding the ability to accommodate and deal with multiculturalism in the city. Led by the Hebrew Union College in collaboration with the Jerusalem Municipality's Education Administration. Michal Moshkat-Baran serves as the academic director of the program and raises funds for it.\n\n\n== Rferences ==",

It is estimated that initially it was an additional tax paid annually in cash (but probably in kind in the 9th/10th century), while in the 10th and 11th centuries it took the form of a tax on cattle, the payment of which was undertaken in total by each village.\nProcopius of Caesarea is the first to mention aerikon, reporting that it was imposed by the emperor Justinian I as an additional annual tax. According to Franz Delger, its name comes from a fine for breaking laws related to the minimum distance that had to be maintained between buildings in cities. In the \"Tacticals\" of Leonos V it is said that the soldiers had to pay the aerikon separately from the regular taxation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Timur Ukhinovich Zhalsarayn (1928, Suduntui village, Aginsky district – 1991, Kusocha village, Mogoytuisky district) was a Transbaikalian teacher, local historian, researcher.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTimur Zhalsarayn was born in 1928 in the village of Suduntui, Aginsky District, to Polon Ukhin, a poor shepherd. He was the thirteenth child in a large family. Timur began his education in 1936 at a local school and later attended the Aginsky Pedagogical College. After graduating from school in 1946, he continued his education in geography at a higher educational institution in Irkutsk. In the early 1950s, Timur Ukhinovich started his teaching career at Aginsky secondary school, where he worked for many years. He also worked in other schools in the Aginsky District.\n\n\n== Research ==\nТ.U. Zhalsarayn identified thirty watershed points of triple watersheds between the most significant rivers. Of these, he described four of the most unique ones. \nIn 1977, T.U. Zhalsarayn highlighted the distinctiveness of the triple watershed of the river systems of the Yenisey, Lena and Amur – some of the largest river systems globally. In 1979, he stated that no other location in the world has any pair of great river systems that are either undefined or form a watershed point with a third river artery similar to itself. Analysing geographical maps, T.U. Zhalsarayn identified and indicated the geographical location of the confluence of the Yenisey, Lena and Amur river systems on the Yablonovy Mountains in Transbaikalia Krai near the city of Chita. Based on this geographical fact, in 1977 T.U. Zhalsarayn spoke about the unique geographical location of the Chita Oblast in the catchment areas of the three largest rivers in the world.\nT.U. Zhalsarayn described the watershed points between various river systems and oceans and seas, including the Amur-Leno-Yenisei junction, the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the Baltic, Caspian and Black Seas, and the Ganges, Indus and Brahmaputra river systems.\n\n\n== Pedagogical skills ==\nDuring the scientific-practical conference Timur Ukhinovich Zhalsarayn - Pedagogue, Geographer, Local Historian, Researcher held in April 2010 in Aginsky, it was stated that Timur Ukhinovich Zhalsarayn's name deserves to be mentioned alongside other great pedagogues such as Zankov and Amonashvili. He was a visionary educator who was ahead of his time by several decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, Zhalsarain introduced teaching based on the technology of logical reference notes (LOC or LOS - sheets of reference signals). This was particularly important in national schools where children had a strong command of their native language but not always the same level of Russian.\n\n\n=== Persecution ===\nThe teacher's programme did not comply with the guidelines, which led to persecution and harassment by education officials. Subsequently, multiple inspections were conducted.\n\n\n== Interests ==\nDuring the 1960s, he directed passionately in a folk theatre. He studied Archimedes' works on numbers and regular polyhedrons. In the 1980s, he wrote several articles on onomastics, numerology, and fiction stories.\n\n\n== Recognition of the merits of Timur Zhalsarayn ==\n\n\n=== Scientific community's support ===\nThe ideas of T.U. Zhalsarayn were supported by F.P. Krendelev, Director of Chita Institute of Natural Resources SB AS USSR. Recognising the scientific significance of Zhalsarayn's discovery, the Zabaykalsky branch of the Russian Geographical Society recommended the creation of a natural monument called Watershed Mountain on the Yablonovy Ridge. In 1983, the Chita Executive Committee of People's Deputies of the USSR created the natural monument. In 2012, the Transbaikal Regional Branch of the Russian Geographical Society named the watershed mountain on the Yablonovy Ridge Pallas Mountain. According to the chairmen of Trans-Baikal Regional Branch of the Russian Geographical Society, Doctor of Historical Sciences A.V. Konstantinov (since 2010) and Y.T. Rudenko (before 2010), Pallas Mountain should become a kind of \"Mecca\" in cognitive tourism. \nThe ideas of T.U. Zhalsarayn have piqued the interest of Mongolian geographers and American researchers at the Glacier National Park research centre. The American Geographical Society took an interest in the research of T.U. Zhalsarayn. They offered to publish articles about him and his concept in American geographical journals. Every year, members of the Trans-Baikal Regional Branch of the Russian Geographical Society provide information about T.U. Zhalsarayn during mass ascents to Mount Pallas.\nIn the book published in 2020 by the Russian Geographical Society, called Modern Russia: geographical description of our Fatherland. Siberia, the \"Apple Ridge – the great watershed of the two world oceans and the three largest rivers of the planet: Lena, Amur and Yenisei\" was selected as the signature landmark of the Transbaikal Territory. It is important to note that the business card of the Zabaikalsky Krai is approved by the responsible editors of the publication, who are well-known Russian geographers. These include Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.M. Kotlyakov and Doctor of Geographical Sciences L.M. Korytny, as well as its reviewers - Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.A. Kryukov and Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences V.A. Snytko.\n\n\n=== Brands of the Zabaykalsky Krai ===\nThe research of T.U. Zhalsarayn served as the foundation for the brands of Zabaykalsky Krai, proposed by the Chairman of the Transbaikal Regional Branch of the Russian Geographical Society Y.T. Rudenko, archaeologist and bard K.O. Shlyamov, and hydrobiologist P.V. Matafonov.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n\"Excellent Worker of Public Education of the RSFSR.\" («Отличник народного просвещения РСФСР»)\n\n\n=== Conferences in memory of Timur Zhalsarayn ===\nIn 2010 the first conference Timur Ukhinovich Zhalsarayn - teacher, geographer, local historian, researcher was held in Aginskoye settlement.\nIn 2013, the Aginsky National Museum named after Gombozhab Tsybykov hosted the second scientific and practical conference titled Timur Ukhinovich Zhalsarayn - Teacher-Innovator, Researcher, Local Historian, which was dedicated to the 85th anniversary of the birth of the man who discovered the watershed on the Yablonovy Ridge.\nIn 2018, a conference was held to celebrate the 90th anniversary of T.U. Zhalsarayn.\nIn 2021, the 5th interregional scientific-practical conference Zhalsaraynovsky Readings-2021 took place in Aginskoye settlement.\n\n\n=== In fiction ===\nTimur Ukhinovich served as the prototype for the teacher in Zhamyan Baldanzhabon's book The Secrets of Alkhanai, which is part of the Buryat literature curriculum for secondary school.\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nZhalsarayn T.U.

        "content": "The grammar of the Slovincian language is characterized by a high degree of inflection, a lack of articles, and vowel, consonant, and stress alternations.\nSlovincian has an inflectional system mostly inherited from Proto-Slavic, with many innovationss.\n\n\n== Nouns ==\nSlovincian has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter; three numbers: singular, dual, and plural; and seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative.\nThe vocative is largely replaced by the nominative, but masculine animate singular and a few feminine singular nouns retain it.\nThe genitive-locative dual has been almost entirely replaced by the plural equivalents, and only few words kept their original forms, e.g.:\n\nrãˈkʉ (\"hand, arm\")\nnôˈgʉ (\"foot, leg\")\nwôˈczʉ (\"eye\")\nwùˈszʉ (\"ear\")\nThe nominative-accusative-vocative dual is found with masculine and feminine nouns and also with monosyllabic neuter stems in stems with non-alternating final consonants ending with ⟨-ô⟩ and in the word ˈjajê (\"egg\"). The dative-instrumental dual only occurs with monosyllabic stems.\nNouns can either have non-alternating final stem consonants or alternating final stem consonants. The non-alternating consonants are ⟨s, z, sz, cz, ż, dż, rz, l, j⟩, and the alternating consonants are ⟨p, b, f, v, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩.\nThe lemma form for nouns is the nominative singular, on which all lexemes are based.\n\n\n=== Masculine nouns ===\nMasculine nouns can end in alternating (⟨p, b, f, v, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩) and non-alternating (⟨s, z, sz, ż, rz, l, j⟩) consonants, a consonant ending with ⟨-a⟩ (opa), and alternating consonants ending with ⟨-ë⟩ (kamë). The last group is small and shows an irregular alternation in the non-nominative cases in the singular and all cases in the plural:\n\nˈkamë, ˈkamjen (\"stone\") > ˈkamjenja (GEN SG). Compare Kashubian: kam, kamiéń, kamiń.\nˈplômë, ˈplômjen (\"flame\"). Compare Kashubian: płom, płomiéń\nA few masculine nouns ending in alternating consonants add ⟨j⟩ to the stem when declined. Some nouns with ⟨ej⟩ will add ⟨j⟩, others will not.\n\nˈkóń (\"horse\") > ˈkônja (GEN SG)\nˈmej (\"May\") > ˈmejjú (GEN SG)\nˈroj (\"swarm of bees\") > ˈrôjú (GEN SG)\nMany masculine nouns whose stem ends in ⟨c⟩ and ⟨z⟩ alternate with ⟨cz⟩ and ⟨ż⟩ in the vocative singular.\n\n\n==== Ending in a consonant ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n==== Ending with ⟨-a⟩ ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n=== Feminine nouns ===\nFeminine nouns can end in a consonant, ⟨-a⟩, and ⟨-o⟩.\nFeminine nouns ending in non-alternating consonants always add ⟨-j-⟩ to non-nominative cases except the genitive plural, which takes -∅.\n\nˈdlon (\"open palm\"), ˈdlonjë (genitive singular), ˈdlon (genitive plural)\nA few feminine nouns end in ⟨-i⟩, ⟨-ëw⟩ (⟨-ew⟩), and ⟨-wja⟩. There are two nouns that end in ⟨-ë⟩ and two nouns that end in ⟨-é⟩:\n\nˈcérkwji, ˈcérkjëw, ˈcérkwja (\"church\") (Compare Kashubian: cerkew, cerczew, cerkwiô)\npolˈnôcë (\"midnight\")\nˈkrë (alternatively ˈkrev) (\"blood\")\nbrëˈvjé (\"eyebrow\")\nɡôspôˈdënjé (\"female host\")\nIt can be noticed that both masculine and feminine nouns can end in a consonant with ⟨-a⟩ ending. Masculine nouns ending in ⟨-a⟩ always refer to a male being and female nouns ending in ⟨-a⟩ a female being; the one exception is ˈslëga (\"servant\") and nouns ending in ⟨-ola⟩, which can refer to a person of either gender.\n\n\n==== With stem ending in an alternating consonant with ⟨-a⟩ ending ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n==== With stem ending in a non-alternating consonant with ⟨-a⟩ ending ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n==== Ending with ⟨-o⟩ ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n==== Ending in a consonant ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n=== Neuter nouns ===\nNeuter nouns can end in a ⟨-ô⟩, a non-alternating consonant with ⟨-é⟩ ending, a consonant with ⟨-ã⟩ ending, and non-alternating consonants with ⟨-ê⟩ ending, the last two groups being sub-classes of the first.\n\n\n==== Ending with ⟨-o⟩ (⟨-ã⟩ or ⟨-ê⟩) ====\n\nExamples:\n\n\n==== With stem ending in a non-alternating consonant with ⟨-é⟩ ending ====\n\n\n=== Consonant alternations ===\nWith one exception, soft stem-final consonants remain unchanged; hard stem-final consonants, however, have a number of alternations:\n\n⟨k⟩ || ⟨kj⟩ || ⟨c⟩ || ⟨cz⟩\n⟨g⟩ || ⟨gj⟩ || ⟨z⟩ || ⟨ż⟩\n⟨zg⟩ || ⟨zgj⟩ || ⟨zdz⟩ || —\n⟨ch⟩ || ⟨chj⟩ || ⟨sz⟩ || ⟨sz⟩\n⟨gh⟩ || ⟨j⟩ || ⟨z⟩ or ⟨ż⟩ || —\n⟨t⟩ || ⟨c⟩\n⟨d⟩ || ⟨dz⟩\n⟨n⟩ || ⟨nj⟩\n⟨m⟩ || ⟨mj⟩\n⟨p⟩ || ⟨pj⟩\n⟨b⟩ || ⟨bj⟩\n⟨f⟩ || ⟨fj⟩\n⟨w⟩ || ⟨wj⟩\n⟨r⟩ || ⟨rz⟩\n⟨c⟩ || ⟨cz⟩\n⟨z⟩ || ⟨ż⟩\n⟨c⟩ || ⟨cz⟩\n⟨z⟩ || ⟨ż⟩\nThe alternations ⟨k⟩||⟨kj⟩, ⟨g⟩||⟨gj⟩, ⟨zg⟩||⟨zgj⟩, ⟨ch⟩||⟨chj⟩, ⟨gh⟩||⟨j⟩ occur:\n\nIn masculine nouns ending in ⟨p, b, f, w, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩ with:\nthe nominative-accusative plural ending ⟨-i⟩:\nˈmjêch (\"sack\") > ˈmjêchji (nominative-accusative plural);\nthe instrumental plural ending ⟨-y⟩:\nˈftoch (\"bird\") > ˈftochjy (instrumental plural).\nIn masculine nouns' stem ending in ⟨p, b, f, w, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩ with nominative ending ⟨-a⟩ with the genitive singular ending ⟨-i⟩:\nˈslëga (\"servant\") > ˈslëgji (geneitive singular).\nIn feminine nouns' stem ending in ⟨p, b, f, w, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩ with nominative ending ⟨-a⟩ with the genitive singular/nominative-accusative plural ending ⟨-i⟩:\nˈmùcha (\"fly (insect)\") > ˈmùchji (genitive singular/nominative-accusative plural).\nIn feminine nouns' stem ending in ⟨p, b, f, w, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩ with nominative ending ⟨-o⟩ with the genitive singular ending ⟨-é⟩ and the locative singular ending ⟨-y⟩:\nSzwétsko (\"Sweden\") > Szvétskjé (genitive singular) > Szwétskjy (locative singular).\nIn neuter nouns' stem ending in ⟨p, b, f, w, t, d, k, g, ch, gh, m, n, r⟩ with nominative ending ⟨-ô⟩ with the instrumental plural ending ⟨-y⟩.

The vowels ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ in the nominative singular of an alternating stem always alternate with ⟨o, ó, é y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩, but ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ are not attested in the nominative singular of an alternating stem. The vowels ⟨ôˈi, au, ùej, ă, ŏ, ĕ, ù̆⟩ never alternate.\nGroup 1~2\n\n⟨o~a⟩, ⟨o~ô⟩: ⟨o~a⟩ sometimes applies to the basic phoneme /ɔ/ and sometimes to the archiphoneme /ɔ/ when unstressed before ⟨r, rz, i, (j)⟩. In all other positions the archiphoneme ⟨o⟩ alternates with ⟨ô⟩.\nˈczod (\"smoke, fume\") > ˈczadú (genitive singular)\nˈwˈãgorz (\"eel\") > ˈwãgôrza (genitive singular) but wãˈgórz (genitive plural)\nˈgwjozda (\"star\") > ˈgwjazdõ (instrumental singular)\nˈpôkoj (\"calm\") > ˈpôkôjú (genitive singular) > pôˈkôjú (locative singular)\n⟨ó~a⟩, ⟨ó~ô⟩: ⟨ó⟩ can alternate between both ⟨a⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ when before a nasal, before other consonants ⟨ó⟩ alternates with ⟨ô⟩. ⟨ó~a⟩ can also be found in the suffix ⟨-ón⟩ indicating inhabitants, in feminine equivalents of these nouns with mobile stress, and in three individual nouns. Outside of these cases, ⟨o~a⟩ is not to be found, and the alternation will be ⟨ó~ô⟩ before a nasal consonant. Stressed ⟨ˈó⟩ is the archiphoneme of /ˈo/ and /ˈɔ/ before ⟨j⟩.\nˈbóg (\"god\") > ˈbôga (genitive singular)\nˈmjêszczón (\"urbanite\") > ˈmjêszczana (genitive singular)\nˈjablónka (\"apple tree\") > jaˈblônkã (instrumental singular)\n⟨é~ê⟩ and ⟨é~ˈej⟩: an alternation of ⟨é~ˈe⟩ is unattested.

Nouns ending in ⟨-ˈëna, -ëna⟩ always show ⟨ë~y⟩. ⟨ë~ó⟩ is a unique exception with one example, being the remnant of a set of alternations ⟨ë~ó⟩, ⟨ë~é⟩, ⟨ù~ó⟩, ⟨i~é⟩. which is still productive in verb stems when followed by /l/ but otherwise obsolete in the noun.\nˈszczêżëla (\"scale (of an animal)\") szczeˈzúl (genitive plural)\nˈsztënja (\"hour\") > ˈsztún (genitive plural)\nˈsztrëga (\"brook, stream\") > ˈsztrúg (genitive plural)\nˈlëba (\"type of weaving rush\") > ˈlúb (genitive plural)\nszëja (\"neck\") > szyj (genitive plural)\nˈstrzëna (\"duct, pipe, tube\") > ˈstrzyn (genitive plural)\nˈstrzëżënë (\"cord, string\") (plurale tantum) > ˈstrzëżyn (genitive plural)\nˈghrëla (fire poker) > ˈghrol (genitive plural)\n⟨i~y⟩ alternate regularly.\nˈszczinë (\"urine\") (plurale tantum) > ˈszczyn (genitive plural)\n⟨ù~ú⟩ alternate regularly.\nˈbùda (\"booth, stall\") > ˈbúd (genitive plural)\n⟨ã~õ⟩ alternate regularly.\nˈlãba (\"sheaf\") > ˈlõb (genitive plural)\n⟨aj~ˈôj⟩ alternate regularly.\nˈjajô (\"egg\") > ˈjôj (genitive plural) > jajˈmy (instrumental plural)\nNouns with fleeting vowels do not count the fleeting vowel for the syllable count of the stem.\nOne can generally predict when alternations take place for each inflection type knowing the gender, number of syllables of the stem, last stem vowel, the voicedness of the final consonant (⟨-ôù⟩ is considered voiced), and whether stress is mobile or stressed.\n⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ ~ ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ alternations occurs for masculine mono-syllabic and polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant or in a consonant ending with ⟨-a⟩ and feminine mono-syllabic and polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant in the genitive, dative, accusative animate, instrumental, and vocative singular and in all the plural (except accusative animate) and dual forms.

However, many such words do not show here this third type of alternation, mostly loanwords.

Nouns with fixed stress keep the stress on the stem, unless the stress is on the end, in which case the stress will always be on the last syllable. If an vowel is inserted in the genitive plural formed with -∅, then that vowel will automatically get the stress. All non-syllabic stems with fixed stress have in the dative and instrumental dual a stress shift to the first syllable of the inflectional suffix.\nNouns with mobile stress can shift it in three ways. \nSome shift it right in the plural and the dual.\n\nThe stress always shifts from its original position in the nominative singular to the final syllable of the ending for non-syllabic and monosyllabic stems. In polysyllabic stems the stress shifts to the last syllabic of the stem.\nˈrãka (\"hand, arm\") > rãˈkõ (instrumental singular) > rãkaˈmy (instrumental plural)\nThe locative singular ending ⟨-ú⟩ causes an automatic shift here.\nSometimes no stress shift occurs in the genitive plural constructed with -∅ here.\nNouns with this type of shift include:\n\nNeuter polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-ô⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nNeuter polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-ã⟩.\nSome shift it right in the genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative plural.\n\nThe stress always shifts from its original position in the nominative singular to the final syllable of the ending for non-syllabic and monosyllabic stems. In polysyllabic stems the stress shifts to the last syllabic of the stem.\nˈrãka (\"hand, arm\") > rãˈkõ (instrumental singular) > rãkaˈmy (instrumental plural)\nAll here feminine nouns automatically shift the stress in the instrumental singular.\nThe locative singular ending ⟨-ú⟩ causes an automatic shift here.\nThe locative singular ending ⟨-i⟩ causes an automatic shift in feminine nouns with a polysyllabic stem ending in a consonant or ending in a consonant +⟨-a⟩.\nNouns with this type of shift include:\n\nMasculine monosyllabic stems ending in a consonant or in a consonant+⟨-a⟩, of which there are two examples. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nMasculine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nMasculine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nFeminine monosyllabic stems ending in a consonant or a consonant +⟨-a⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nFeminine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nFeminine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nNeuter monosyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-ô⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nFeminine nouns with polysyllabic stems except compounds formed with ⟨-môc⟩ and ⟨vë-⟩.\nSome shift it left in non-animate accusative singular and the nominative and accusative plural and dual.\n\nThe stress shifts from the final stem syllable to the initial syllable of the noun.\nrôˈbôta (\"work\") > ˈrôbôtã (accusative singular)\nNouns with this type of shift include:\n\nMasculine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩ of which there is only one example.\nFeminine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩. These nouns can also have fixed stress.\nFeminine polysyllabic stems ending in a consonant+⟨-é⟩, of which there is one example.\nAll other nouns have fixed stress.\nGeneral rules:\n\nFeminine nouns with monosyllabic stems ending in a consonant usually have fixed stress, with the exception of 9 nouns.\nMasculine nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩ are always have fixed stress except those ending ⟨-ola⟩, which can be of either gender.\nMasculine nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩ and feminine nouns ending in a consonant+⟨y⟩ are considered nouns ending in a consonant.\nNouns ending in a consonant+⟨-a⟩ never stress the last syllable of the word.\nFeminine nouns ending in a consonant always have stress on the first syllable, with two exceptions.\nFeminine nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-o⟩ always stress the last syllable, with a few exceptions.\nNeuter nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-ô⟩ never stress the last syllable, with one exception.\nNeuter nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-é⟩ always stress the penultimate syllable.\nNeuter nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-ã⟩ stress the initial syllable.\nIt is possible to predict the stress pattern of a noun if one knows:\n\nIf a noun has fixed or mobile stress\nThe number of syllables of the stem\nThe stressed syllable of the nominative singular\nThe gender\nThe type of declension\nIn Slovincian, prepositions can act as proclitics and take stress completely away from masculine and feminine nouns ending in a consonant or a consonant+⟨-a⟩ and from neuter nouns ending in a consonant+⟨-ô⟩ or in a consonant+⟨-ã⟩.\nThis happens to:\n\nAll nouns with a non-syllabic or monosyllabic stem, fixed or stress that shifts right in the genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative plural have stress retracted when the initial syllable of the word is stress, except in the genitive plural ending in -∅.\nNouns with mobile stress with polysyllabic stems retract the stress in words which are stressed on the initial syllable of the word.\nNo retraction occurs in:\n\nNouns with polysyllabic stems with fixed stress.\nPolysyllabic prepositions and a few monosyllabic prepositions.\nPrepositional phrases where another word, such as a determiner or adjective, is between the preposition and the noun.\nThere is a strong tendency for words with stress on final or only syllable of the inflectional suffix when there is a preposition to retract to the initial syllable of the word.\nSometimes both the noun and the preposition are stressed.\n\n\n== Adjectives ==\nThere are long, short, and possessive adjectives. Short adjectives are uncommon. Short adjectives are used predicatively. In addition to hard and soft declension, like Kashubian, Slovincian velar stems soften in the nominative but are hard in other cases.\n\nThe short masculine/neuter genitive form and ⟨-o⟩ is most often found with adjectives that do not have a stress on the final syllable, especially when they are used as nouns. It is rare in adjectives with word-final stress, and the most rare in velar stems, which, even when not stressed word-finally, prefer ⟨-éwo⟩. For ˈzly (\"bad\"), the genitive is always ˈzlévo.\n⟨-ë⟩ is sometimes used instead of the phonetic ⟨-i⟩ in soft stems in the genitive-instrumental-locative plural and dative-instrumental dual, this almost never happens with velar stems.\n\n\n=== Adjective comparative and superlative ===\nSlovincian has ⟨-szy⟩ and ⟨-êszy⟩ as comparative suffixes. ⟨-szy⟩ is used in stems that end with a single consonant. Some stems ending in ⟨-k⟩ typically lose it, but the ⟨k⟩ is often restored analogously. If a stem ends in multiple consonants, ⟨-êszy⟩, which can can stress and stem alternations such as ⟨t, n, r⟩ ~ ⟨c, nj, rz⟩.\n\nˈsaty > ˈsatszy\nˈkrótkjy > ˈkrótszy\ngãsˈty > gãsˈcêszy\nˈmôkry > môˈkrzêszy\nSlovincian, like other Slavic languages also has suppletive comparatives.\n\nˈdôbry > ˈlêpszy\nˈzly > ˈgôrszy\nˈwjelgy > wjitzy\nˈmoly > ˈmjêszy\nThe superlative is formed from the comparative with the prefix ⟨na-⟩.\n\n\n=== Adjective stress patterns ===\nThe accent of the long adjectives is fixed.\nPossessive adjectives ending in ⟨-ó⟩ and ⟨-yn⟩ have a definite and indefinite form in the lemma form, and a definite form everywhere else. Possessive adjectives derived from monosyllabic stems emphasize the stem syllable. Polysyllabic stems emphasize the last stem syllable if the base word has a movable accent; however, if the base word has a fixed accent, the possessive adjective emphasizes the same syllable as the base word. Other possessive adjectives have a fixed accent.\nPlace names ending in ⟨-ôwô, -ënô⟩ are neuter possessive adjectives; those ending in ⟨-ôwô⟩ withdraw the accent as much as possible.\nOrdinal numerals are long adjectives and as such emphasize the penultimate syllable.\n\n\n== Adverbs ==\nAdverbs can be formed from adjectives as well as prepositional phrases.\n\n\n=== Adverb comparative and superlative ===\nThe comparative adverb is formed by adding the suffix ⟨-é⟩. Adverbs also have suppletive comparatives. The superlative is formed by putting the prefix ⟨no-⟩ in front of the comparative. ⟨-é⟩ causes consonant softening: ⟨p, b, w, m, t, d, st, zd, n, k, g, ch, r⟩ alternate with ⟨pj, bj, wj, mj, c, dz, szcz, żdż, nj, cz, ż, sz, rz⟩.\n\n\n== Pronouns ==\nPronouns share the same cases, numbers, and genders with nouns, but the vocative is the same as the nominative, and is only used with second person pronouns, and only personal pronouns have the dual. The three genders are only distinct for the non-personal or third-person pronouns. Pronouns may be used as clitics, and may occur generally in stressed or unstressed positions. Some have short forms, used in unstressed positions.\n\nIn addition to personal pronouns, Slovincian also has:\n\nDemonstratives: ˈtên, ˈta, ˈtô (\"this\"), ˈnên, ˈna, ˈnô (\"this\"), ˈwôn, ˈwôna, ˈwônô (\"he\", \"she\", \"it\"), (occurring only in the nominative forms); taˈkjy, taˈko, taˈkjé (\"such\", which inflects as a long adjective), ˈjên (\"he\");\nInterrogative pronouns: ˈchtô (\"who\"), ˈcô (\"what\") and their compounds: ˈnjicht (\"nobody\"), ˈnjic (\"nothing\"); chtôˈlê, côˈlê; chtôˈbõdz, côˈbõdz; chtôˈkôlwjek, côˈkôlwjek; chtôleˈbõdz, côleˈbõdz, chtôleˈkôlwjek, côleˈkôlwjek; bëleˈchtô, bëleˈcô; dzeˈcô; ˈnjêjëden (\"some\"); ˈchtôry (\"which\"), jaˈkjy (\"what\"), ˈkóżdy (\"every\"), ˈjyny (\"other\") and their combinations: ˈchtôryˈlê, ˈchtôryˈbõdz, ˈchtôryˈkôlwjek, ˈchtôryleˈbõdz, ˈchtôryleˈkôlwjek, bëleˈchtôry, njêˈchtôry, njeˈchtôry; jaˈkjylê, jakjyˈbõdz, jakjyˈkôlwjek, jakjyleˈbõdz, jakjyleˈkôlwjek, bëleˈjakjy, njiˈjakjy; ˈkóżdyˈkôlwjek, wszeˈlakjy, wszeleˈjakjy, wszelerˈjakny, wszelerˈjakny (\"all sorts\"); ˈwszëden (\"all\"); ˈczy, ˈczo, ˈczé (\"whose\") and its compounds czyˈlê, czyˈbõdz, czyˈkôlwjek, czyleˈbõdz, czyleˈkôlwjek, bëleˈczy;\nRelative pronouns: the indeclinable cô serves as a general relative particle, to which the forms of ˈjên can be added in the oblique cases; ˈchtôry, ˈchtôro, ˈchtôré (\"which\") and jaˈkjy, jaˈko, jaˈkjé (\"such\") (the last two inflect as a long adjective);\nIndefinite pronouns: ˈchtôsz, ˈchtesz (\"who?\"), ˈcesz (\"what?\"), ˈchtôrysz, ˈchttôrósz, ˈchttôresz (\"which one?\") and jaˈkjysz, jaˈkosz, jaˈkjéjsz (\"of what kind?\"), ˈczysz, ˈczosz, ˈczéjsz (\"whose?\") (the last three inflect as a long adjective);\nQuantitative pronouns: ˈjëden, ˈjëna, ˈjënô (\"one\"), ˈdwa, ˈdwjê (\"two\"), ˈwôba, ˈwôbjë, (\"both\"), ˈżõden, ˈżóno, ˈżóné (\"none\");\nPossessive pronouns: ˈmój (\"my\"), ˈtwój (\"your\"), ˈswój (reflexive possessive pronoun \"one's\"), ˈnasz (\"our\"), ˈwasz (\"you all's\");\n\nAlternative forms starting with ⟨nj-⟩ are used after prepositions.\n\nˈtwój and ˈswój decline similarly, as well as ˈnasz and ˈwasz, but the latter only differ in the nominative and accusative. Many of these forms are the result of vowel contractions; uncontracted forms died out; but the nominative ˈmôja, ˈtwôja, ˈtwôjë still occured in folk songs and in the Lord's Prayer. ˈczy inflects like ˈmój, only in the plural and dual, it has ⟨i⟩ instead of ⟨ë⟩: ˈczimy, ˈczima.\n\n\n== Numerals ==\nSlovincian has ordinal, cardinal, and collective numerals.\nThe cardinal numbers 1-20, words for tens (30, 40, etc.), hundreds, and thousands in Slovincian have a single word, all others are made through combining other cardinal numbers. There are no ordinals of numbers over 30 in Slovenian.\nThe numerals jˈëden, dwˈa, trzˈë, sztˈérzë (\"one, two, three, four\") and are declinable. Numbers from five (pjˈync) to twenty (dwadzˈêsca) except word for \"teens\" ending in ⟨-e⟩ are declinable. Teens are usually indeclinable, but sometimes decline like adjectives. They are sometimes reduced to ⟨-no⟩. tˈësinc (\"thousand\") behaves grammatically like a noun and declines as one.\nOrdinal numerals are long adjectives and are inflected as such. There are no ordinal numerals above 30. Collective numerals are only used in the nominative and accusative.\nMultiplicative numerals are long adjectives; numerals ending in ⟨-jak⟩ are adverbs.\nThe fractional number words formed with ⟨pôù-⟩ are usually declinable.\n\n\n=== Numeral stress patterns ===\nDi- and multi-syllable cardinal numerals are emphasized on the last syllable. In inflectable numerals the accent is fixed.\nNumerals for tens from 30 to 90 and for thousands have the main stress on the stem (the root for hundred, thousand). Words for the thousands often have a primary stress on both elements. This is always the case for those exceeding 10,000. Conversely, the hundreds emphasize the number word; if this is polysyllabic, the following noun has a secondary accent.\n\ndwadzˈêscë (\"twenty\"), where ⟨dzêsc-⟩ is the stem for \"ten\"\nˈtrzësta or ˈtrzëˌsta (\"three hundred\")\nWords for numerals between the tens (21, 34, etc.) are composed of the ones digit numeral, a connecting a (\"and\"), and the tens numeral. In the expressions for 21 to 29, the primary stress is on the connecting a and the number words themselves usually both have a secondary stress, or both number words are fully stressed and the a follows the decade number word proclitic. For non-tens numerals higher than 30, the latter is always the case.\n\ndwa‿ˈa‿dwadzêscë\ntrzë‿a‿dvadzˈêscë\nCollective numerals are emphasized on the same syllable as the cardinal numeral counterparts.\nThe distributive numerals formed with ⟨po-, pô-⟩ place the accent on the prefix up to 40.\nFractional numerals formed with ⟨pôù-⟩ emphasize either the prefix or the penultimate syllable. ⟨pôù-⟩ has a secondary accent if the word contains more than three syllables. In the inflected forms there is only penultimate stress.\n\n\n== Verbs ==\nLike Polish and Kashubian, Slovincian has lost the Proto-Slavic imperfect and the aorist forms. The l-participle has taken its place as the past tense form. The other differences in tense are either expressed through paraphrases or remain formally unmarked. The supine has also disappeared. Most participles have been lost. The Slovincian future tense, perfect, pluperfect, conditional and passive form have periphrastic formations.\nThe lemma forms of verbs is the infinitive, ending in ⟨-c⟩. Verbs can be divided into five main classes, each with several subclasses.\nSlovincian has perfective and imperfective aspects verbs much like Kashubian or Polish.\n\n\n=== Conjugation ===\n\nDual forms for neuter subjects are not used.\nThe imperative is formed in two ways, depending on whether the stem ends in a consonant or a vowel. Stems ending in a consonant form the imperative by adding ⟨-i⟩ (⟨-ë⟩ after hard consonants.) Stems ending in a vowel add the ending ⟨-j⟩, which can sometimes disappear. The third person singular imperative is the same as the second person imperative, and the third person plural and dual imperative is formed with ⟨nô⟩ and the third person plural/dual present form\nThe active present participle has the ending ⟨-õcy⟩ for all verbs and is inflected as a long adjective. The present adverbial participle is formed ⟨-õcë⟩, forms without ⟨-ë⟩ do not occur, and is indeclinable.\nThe past tense is formed using the old l-participle and declines for gender and number:\n\nMasculine singular: ⟨-l⟩\nFeminine singular: ⟨-la⟩\nNeuter singular: ⟨-lô⟩\nVirile plural: ⟨-ly⟩\nNon-virile: ⟨-le⟩\nThe masculine singular ending ⟨-l⟩ disappears if a verb has an consonantal stem (classes IA, IIA., IIB and sometimes III1A and V).\n\npjêc (\"to bake\") (stem pjêk-) > pjêk (\"masculine singular past\")\nThe feminine singular and masculine dual contract in classes IB, IC, III1B—E, III2, IVB, IVC. and some of classes III1A and V.\n\n*bьrala > ˈbrala > ˈbra\n*xъtěla > cela > ca\nIn classes IIG and with some classes of III1A, in the feminine singular and masculine dual, the ⟨-l-⟩ disappears and contraction occurs; in the masculine singular, to ⟨-ón-⟩ and in other forms the ⟨-l-⟩ combines with the nasal vowel; \n\n*tisnąlъ > ˈcësnón\n*tisnąla > cësˈnã (pronounced cesˈnã)\n*tisnąlo > ˈcësnanô\nThe past participle is formed with ⟨-ly, -ty, -ny, -jôny⟩ and inflected as a long adjective. These participles have completely collapsed in stress: the past participle Regardless of the suffix with which it is formed, it has an active or passive meaning depending on the verbal term. ⟨-ly⟩ is common in classes IA, IIA, IIB, and often in classes III2A, III2B, IVB, as well as some verbs of class V. ⟨-ty⟩ is used in class III1A. ⟨-ny⟩ is with classes IB, IC, III1B, III1C, III1D, III2C, III2D, IVC, and subclasses of III1A. and III2A. and some classes III2A, III2B, IVB, as well as some classes of V and IIC. ⟨-jôny⟩ is only found in the verbs of class IVA.\nA verbal noun, which is a declinable neuter noun, can be formed from every verb with the suffixes ⟨-cé, -njé, and -ênjé⟩. ⟨-cé⟩ is common wherever the past participle is formed by ⟨-ty⟩ (class III1A), except for some verbs ending with ⟨r⟩, which form the verbal noun from the present stem. ⟨-njé⟩ is used in classes IB, IC, III1B—E, III2, IVB, IVC, and some verbs of the classes III1A, V, IA, IIC, and III1A2a. ⟨-ênjé⟩ is used in class IVA.\nThe present tense of the perfective verb is usually used as the future tense, e.g. B. jo‿ˈpôjadã (\"I will go (by vehicle)\") next to jo‿ˈjadã \"I am going (by vehicle)\". An imperfective future is formed with the bõdã+ the l-participle, e.g. B. jo‿tô‿ˈbõdã ˈczynjél (\"I will be doing that\"), but this construction is rare. Sometimes the perfective future is the same as the imperfective present: jo‿ˈrzúcã (\"I will throw/I am throwing) from the infinitives rzëcac (impferfective) and rzëcëc (pronounced rzëcec; perfective).\nA perfect tense and the pluperfect tense can be formed through paraphrasis, bëc l-participle/mjêc +  l-participle or a past passive participle. If bëc is used, the participle agrees in gender and number. If mjêc is used, the participle will either be in the neuter singular, or, much more regularly in gender and number.\nThe conditional is formed by combining an l-participle with the particle bä, which has a shortened form b.\nThe passive voice can be formed using bëc + a passive participle or by using sã, however the active is usually preferred.\n\n\n==== Class I ====\n⟨-t, -d, -s, -z, -k, -g, -r⟩ stems belong to class IA.\n\n\n==== Class II ====\n\n\n==== Class III ====\nClass III1A comprises of verbs with stem-final ⟨i, ë, ú, ô, a, n, m, r, rz⟩.\n\nIII1A1a: stem vowel is ⟨y⟩ from Proto-Slavic *i\nˈbjic > ˈbjijã\nIII1A1b: stem vowel is ⟨ë⟩ from Proto-Slavic *i, *y\nˈszëc > ˈszëjã\nIII1A1c: stem vowel is ⟨ú⟩ from Proto-Slavic *u\nˈczúc > ˈczújã\nIII1A1d: stem vowel is ⟨ë⟩ from Proto-Slavic *u\nˈklëc > ˈklëjã\nIII1A1e: stem vowel is ⟨ë⟩ from Proto-Slavic *ô\nˈklôc > ˈklôjã\nIII1A1f: stem vowel is ⟨a⟩ from Proto-Slavic *ô\nˈklôc > ˈklôjã\nIII1A2a: stem consonant is ⟨n, m⟩\nˈcyc > ˈtnã\nIII1A2b: stem consonant is ⟨r, rz⟩ with no vowel\ndrżéc > drzą\nIII1A2c: stem consonant is ⟨r, rz⟩ with a vowel\nˈpôrc > ˈpôrzã\n\nClass III1B comprises of verbs whose past stems and the infinitive stems are the same as the verbal stem, augmented by the suffix -a-.\n\nClass III1Ca comprises of verbs whose past and infinitive stems are the same as the verbal stem, augmented by the suffix -a- and have e-present tenses amd III1Cb has je-present tenses. Class III1D comprises of verbs whose past and infinitive stems are the same as the verbal stem, augmented by the suffix -ja-.\n\nClass III1Ca: ˈbrac > ˈbjêrzã\nClass III1Cb: ˈdrapac > ˈdrapjã\n\nClass III1E comprises of verbs whose past and infinitive stems are the same as the verbal stem, augmented by the suffix -ě-.\n\nClass III2Aa comprises of verb stems that start with a except for some primary verbs denominative and deverbative verbs.

Class III2D past and infinitive stems are the same as the verbal stem, augmented by the suffix -ja- and whose inflection starts with -a-. III2Ca and III2Da comprise of denominative verbs and III2Cb and III2Db are iteratives of a-verbs. In III2C the imperative and active present participle suppleted by those of class III2D. This inflection only exists in the Kluki and Wierzchocino-Siecie dialects. For Class III2D present tense and present adverbial participle are not present and are replaced by those of Class III2C.\n\n\n==== Class IV ====\nClass IV verbs end in ⟨-yc, -ëc⟩. Class IVAa comprises of verbs whose stems end in ⟨p, b, f, w, m, n, k, zg, j⟩, and IVAb in the remaining consonants.\n\nIVAa: ˈkúpjyc > ˈkúpjã\nIVAb: ˈrzëcëc (pronounced ˈrzëcec) > ˈrzúcã\n\nClass IVBa preserves softening of the final consonant, whereas IVBb does not.\n\n\n==== Class V ====\nThis class comprises of nine base verbs (and their prefixed derivatives) which had the ending -m in the first person singular.\nVa includes verbs whose present tense roots do not have any special stem-forming element. Vb includes verbs with reduplication. Vc includes the future tense of bˈëc. Vd includes verbs with a nasal infix.\n\nVa: ˈjêsc > ˈjém\nVb: ˈdac > ˈdóm\nVc: ˈbóm\nVd: ˈmôc > ˈmõżesz/ˈmõsz\n\n\n=== Verb stress alternations ===\nLike nouns, verbs can have different stress patterns. The base form of the verb is the infinitive.\nAffixless polysyllabic simple verbs have stress on the penultimate syllable of the infinitive, except drëˈżêc (\"to shiver, to shake\"); verbs whose stem ends in a consonant + eding ⟨-ac⟩ belonging to class III2D (⟨-újã⟩ in the first person present) always stress the first syllable, and all verbs ending in ⟨-oc⟩ can be stressed either on the penultimate or the final syllable.\nPrefixed verbs maintain the position of the stress as in the prefixless one, except for drëˈżêc which can have a left-shifting stress when prefixed, e.g. ˈzadrëżêc.\nPrefixed derived from monosyllabic verbs always show the stress on the very first syllable of the infinitive, except verbs ending in ⟨-nõc⟩, which show two alternative stresses if they are composed of with a polysyllabic prefix and three other verbs.\n\njêsc (\"to eat\") > ˈnjêdôjêsc (\"to not finish eating\")\nˈrznõc > ˈrôzderznõc and rôzˈderznõc\nAll perfective verbs and some imperfective verbs prefixed with ⟨vë-⟩ have stress on the prefix.\nPresent tense forms can have fixed and mobile stress patterns.\nThe basic forms for the present tense is the first person singular, which always has stress on the initial syllable, with one exception, drëˈżêc (\"to shiver, to shake\"), which has fixed stress on the first syllable of the inflectional suffix. All other form have the stress on the last syllable before the inflectional suffix. Class III2A (verbs in ⟨-ac⟩) show a regular stress shift onto the inflectional suffix in the third person plural.\ndrëˈżêc (\"to shiver, to shake\") and perfective verbs prefixed with ⟨wë-⟩ break this rule, and non-syllabic verb stems stick to this rule if they are composed with two prefixes or a bisyllabic prefix but have alternative forms with fixed stress. Only mobile stress is possible if the first prefix in such a verb is the negation particle ⟨njê-⟩.\nAthematical verbs with one prefixed syllable are regular, and only the third person plural has enough syllables for a stress shift. However, in combination with two prefixed syllables, they behave as if the prefix consists of one syllable, so the stress is fixed except in the third person plural.\nNon-prefixed verbs in the first person singular may shift the stress to the pronoun ⟨jo⟩ (\"I\") if it is before the verb (see Lorentz par 112). This stress shift is rare in monosyllabic present forms with a V1, but there are many exceptions\nVerbs also display three types of alternations.\nThe past tense of verbs in ending in ⟨-nãc⟩ emphasize the feminine singular ending, in the other forms they withdraw the accent to the first syllable.\n\nˈcygnón > cygˈnã\nA general rule for the past tense forms is that the accent in all forms is withdrawn as much as possible.\n\n\n=== Verb vowel alternations ===\nIf the infinitive has ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj ŭ⟩ as the stem vowel, (in class IA:Vsd), then there is no alternation, except for all verbs of class IA (except the stem ⟨-jõsc⟩ (\"to carry, to bear\") and a few class IIC verbs.\nClass IA verbs show regular ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj ŭ⟩ ~ ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ alternations; ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ in the infinitive and ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ everywhere else except the past masculine singular.\nClass IIC verbs with any alternation (not all have it) change ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ into ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ in the imperative and often in all l-forms where /-l/ isnˈt the final phoneme of the word.\nIf verb has ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ as a stem vowel or a single vowel, verb classes IA (except lˈêsc (\"to climb\")), II, IIIA2, III2Ab, III2B, III2C, III2D, and IVB do not have a ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj ŭ⟩ ~ ⟨a, ô, e, ë, y, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ or ⟨a, ô, e, ë, y, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩~⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ alternation in the forms with an inflectional suffix vowel, but all other verbs are split into alternating and non-alternating (with ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj ŭ⟩ in the present and l-forms, and n-forms in the verbal noun) subclasses.\nThe past tense always shows ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ in the masculine singular, ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ in all other cases except in classes IAa and IAc, where alternative forms with ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ can be found. This results in regular ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ ~ ⟨a, ô, e, ë, y, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ alternations.\n\n⟨ôù~a⟩ before ⟨l⟩ in IB, IC, III1A1f, III1B, III1C, III1D, III1E, III2, IVB, IVC\n⟨ó~a⟩ before ⟨n⟩ in IIB, IIC, III1A2a\n⟨é~ë⟩, ⟨é~y⟩, ⟨ó~ù⟩, ⟨ó~ë⟩, and ⟨ó~ô⟩ before ⟨l⟩\n⟨é~ë⟩ in III1A1b and IVAb\n⟨é~y⟩ in III1A1a and IVAa\n⟨ó~ù⟩ in III1A1c\n⟨ó~ë⟩ in III1A1d\n⟨ó~ô⟩ in III1A1e\nThe infinitive can have either ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ or ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ in the final syllable. III1A1a, III1A1b, III1A1c, III1A1d, IVAa, and IVAb, the inflectional suffix vowel (or only vowel in verbs with only one) is conditioned by the preceding consonant.\nClasses III1A1a-e and III1A2c show the V2 of the infinitive for ⟨c⟩ forms of the verbal nouns. Class III1A2a shows ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩~⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ alternation. Classes IC, III1C, III1D, III1E, III2Aa, III2C, III2D, and IVC show the ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ of the infinitive for ⟨-n⟩ forms. Class III1A2b shows ⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩~⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩ alternation. Classes show III2Ab and IVB show\n⟨ë~ê⟩ alternations and not ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩~⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ since ⟨ë⟩ is the archiphoneme of /ə/ and /ɛ/ in this position; The other classes have ⟨-ˈênjé) without any rule.\nIn classes I, II, III1A2b, III1Ca, III1Cb, III1D, III1A2a, IVAa, IVAb, IVBa, and IVBb the inflectional suffix vowels ⟨ë⟩ and ⟨y⟩ in the imperative are conditioned by the preceding consonant. The imperative and present tense acquire a special treatment only when there is one vowel in the verb.\nIn the following verb classes the vowel show regular alternations in the imperative on the basis of the present tense forms if it is the only vowel in the verb:\n\nIII1A1a: ⟨y~i⟩\nIII1A1b: ⟨ë~i⟩\nIII1A1c: ⟨ù~ú⟩\nIII1A1d: ⟨ë~ú⟩\nIII1A1e: ⟨ô~ó⟩\nIII1B: ⟨ˈê~ˈé⟩\nClasses III2Ab and III2B show a regular alternation ⟨a, ô, e, ë, i, ã, ê, aj⟩ / ⟨ôˈù, ej, ĭ⟩~⟨o, ó, é, y, ú, õ, ˈôù, ˈôj, ŭ⟩ (⟨ˈê~éˈ⟩, the former in the present tense, the latter in the imperative.\nTwo classes of verbs have two sets of alternations:\n\nIB: ⟨a~ôù, ó, o⟩ and /ô~ó/\nIII1B: /a~ôù, ó, o/ and ⟨ˈê~ˈé⟩\nThe second type of alternations:\nConditioned by final stem consonant ⟨t, d, s, z, n, r, l⟩. Classes IB, III1B, and III2B show this alternation.\nThe third type of alternation is rare.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKashubian grammar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "The Obonga-Ottertooth Provincial Park is located about 200 kilometres (120 mi) north of Thunder Bay, in Ontario, Canada. It protects a 100 kilometres (62 mi) long stretch of lakes and streams between Obonga Lake in the east and Kashishibog Lake in the west, mostly following the Kashishibog River and Ottertooth Creek. The park is notable as an important recreational link between Brightsand River Provincial Park, Kopka River Provincial Park, and the Lake Nipigon basin.\nMajor lakes in the park include Hawn, Kashishibog, Kershaw, Obonga, Savage, Survey, and Tommyhow Lakes. The height-of-land between Hawn and Tommyhow Lakes divides the Arctic and Atlantic watersheds.\nThe park is characterized by a rough, hilly landscape with boreal forests, mixed with extensive sand and gravel deposits and low rocky outcrops. Its vegetation is mostly jack pine, with black spruce in swampy areas. The park is a significant habitat for woodland moose, including a calving area just west of Kashishibog Lake.\nThe park is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no services for visitors and minimal facilities. The park can be used for backcountry camping, canoeing, boating, hunting, and fishing. In particular, it provides wilderness canoeing opportunities, although the canoe routes through the park are not regularly maintained. The canoe route through the Ottertooth Creek canyon is especially difficult but rewarding for its \"unusual and spectacular scenery of rapids, waterfalls, talus boulders and steep canyons.\"\nThe park is mostly within the Lake Nipigon watershed, an area designated as the Lake Nipigon Basin Signature Site, known for its remarkable range of natural and recreational values that includes several provincial parks, conservation reserves, and management areas around Lake Nipigon. Obonga-Ottertooth Provincial Park connects with Kopka River Provincial Park at Kashishibog and Obonga Lakes, forming a huge waterway park loop.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paula Orive Ozores (born 29 November 1982) is a retired Spanish rhythmic gymnast. As a member of the senior group she is an European and World medalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter practicing swimming at the Fundación Estadio, Paula began rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 7. She first entered the Arabatxo Club with the trainer Agurtzane Ibargutxi, and later moved to the Oskitxo Club in Vitoria until 1992, a club from which other outstanding Spanish gymnasts such as Lorena Guréndez or Beatriz Nogalez have emerged, under the orders of Natalia Notchevnaya. In 1994 she was the Spanish children's champion, and in both 1995 and 1996, she was the Spanish junior team champion with Oskitxo. In 1996 she was Spanish junior individual champion. That same year she began to participate in international tournaments as junior in Fukuoka, Calais and Portimão, achieving some 4th places and several bronze medals. In 1997 she competed in the honor category in the Spanish Individual Championships held in Valladolid, being 4th overall and winning bronze with both rope and clubs. In July 1997 she joined the national senior group called up by María Fernández Ostolaza who replaced Emilia Boneva, who had undergone heart surgery in November 1996.\nPaula did not compete as a starter until September at the Epson Cup in Tokyo, where she won gold. By 1997, the group members had already moved their residence from the chalet in Canillejas to a building attached to the INEF and had begun training at the Madrid High Performance Center. In 1998 they competed with 3 ribbons and 2 hoops and with 5 balls, using the Sevillian \"Juego de luna y arena\" (inspired by a poem by Lorca) and the tango \"El vaivén\", two songs by José Luis Barroso, for their music cuts. Paula would be a starter that year in both routines. After the group competed in some preparatory tournaments in Kalamata and Budapest, at the World Championships in Seville,  Paula, Sara Bayón, Marta Calamonte, Lorena Guréndez, Carolina Malchair, Beatriz Nogalesz and Nuria Cabanillas became world champions with 3 ribbons and 2 hoops where the team managed to beat Belarus with a score of 19.850. Furthermore, on the first day the team had obtained the silver medal in the All-Around with a cumulative score of 39.133. They placed 7th in the 5-ball competition.  The group received the Longines Award for Elegance in this championship, a trophy awarded by the watch brand and the FIG during prominent international gymnastics competitions. \nBy 1999 Nancy Usero was the group's new coach and national head coach. That season Nancy had Dalia Kutkaite as assistant and coach of the junior group, and Cristina Álvarez as choreographer the first year. During that year, they competed with 3 ribbons and 2 hoops and with 10 clubs, the first using \"Zorongo gitano\" and the second with \"Babelia\" by Chano Domínguez, Hozan Yamamoto and Javier Paxariño, as music. Paula was one of the starters in both routines along Bayón, Calamonte, Guréndez, Malchair and Nogales. At the end of May, at the European Championships in Budapest, the group was 7th in the All-Around due to a poor score in the 10 clubs exercise. They won bronze in the 3 ribbons and 2 hoops final. In August the group won silver with 3 ribbons and 2 hoops at the DTB-Pokal in Bochum. At the end of September they placed 7th in the All-Around at the World Championships in Osaka, which gave them qualification for the Sydney Olympic Games the following year. Subsequently, they placed 6th in both event finals.\nHowever, Paula could not compete in the Olympic Games since coach Nancy Usero decided to let her go along her and her teammates Marta Alves, Sara Bayón and Ana del Toro, so she retired in November 1999.\nAfter retiring from competition in March 2000 she received a tribute from the Basque Gymnastics Federation. Later she obtained the title of national coach of 3rd level and graduated in physical education and sports. Shortly after, she began directing, along with Diana Rodríguez, the cheerleaders of the Saski Baskonia basketball team from Vitoria, known as Dancing Team Baskonia, also working as a cheerleader on some occasions. She is currently technical director and coach of the Oskitxo Club of Vitoria, after having been assistant to coach Natalia Notchevnaya since 2000. In November 2016, together with María Ereñaga, she promoted a joint technicalization project called Gimnasia Vitoria, which is made up of the clubs they direct, Rítmica Vitoria and Oskitxo, in which Lorena Guréndez, Tania Lamarca and Estíbaliz Martínez are also involved in different areas. In April 2020, one of the jerseys with which she became world champion was auctioned for 975 euros in a charity bid for the fight against COVID-19.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Krone Agriculture is the parent company of the Agricultural Machinery Technology subgroup of Bernard Krone Holding, based in Spelle in the district of Emsland. In the 2022/23 financial year, the company generated a revenue of over €1 billion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and beginnings ===\nThe Bernard Krone machine factory in Spelle was founded in 1906 by master blacksmith Bernhard Krone and his wife Anna. The company was initially active in horse shoeing. Under the management of Bernard Krone II, the son of the founder, a machinery trade and a small agricultural machinery production facility were added.Towards the end of the 1920s, the company began production of manual straw cutters, straw and beet cutters, potato crushers, disc harrows, and cultivators. In 1930, Krone received a patent for the construction of a horse-drawn fertilizer spreader. After World War II, Krone produced new machines, such as a centrifugal slurry pump with an agitator and galvanized housing. In 1948, Krone began to manufacture earth shovels, disc harrows, cultivators, fertilizer spreaders and rubber-tired farm wagons in a newly built production site. In 1951, the first all-terrain reversible plow was introduced, which enabled tractors to plow without hydraulics or lifting gear. With the motorized harrow in 1954, Krone introduced the company's first agricultural machine to be driven by PTO shafts.\n\n\n=== Expansion at home and abroad ===\nIn 1963, a plant was founded in Werlte, where some of the Emsland tippers were manufactured.After the death of Bernard Krone II in 1970, his 29-year-old son Bernard Krone III became managing director of the company. A subsidiary was founded in the USA in 1973. In the same year, the company LVD Bernard Krone was founded to sell agricultural machinery. In 1993, the first large square baler was built under the name BiG Pack, which was the first Krone agricultural machine to be launched on the market in the new colors green and beige instead of the previous colors red and beige. One year later, the production of soil tillage machinery was discontinued and from then on, Krone concentrated on forage harvesting technology. In 1996, Krone launched the BiG M self-propelled large-area mower, which earned an entry in the 2001 Guinness Book of Records. In 2000, Krone launched the BiG X self-propelled forage harvester.From 2005, Krone offered a chopping drum customized to the requirements of modern biogas plants. In 2007, Krone put a new paint plant into operation at the Spelle site. In the same year, Bernard Krone IV became the fourth generation managing director of Krone Holding, while in August 2010, he was appointed managing director of the entire Krone Group.In 2012, Krone opened a new logistics center in Spelle for €2.6 million. This was followed a year later by the inauguration of a new training center, which offers training for technicians and dealers and includes a test track for forage harvesters. In 2014, Krone invested €14.5 million in a technology center with space for 500 employees. At Agritechnica 2015, Krone presented the Premos 5.000, a mobile pelleting press that produces pellets in the field.In the 2015 financial year, export sales accounted for 70 percent of total sales. On January 1, 2016, the business structure of all companies belonging to Bernard Krone was adjusted. As part of this, the agricultural machinery division was merged into the new Krone Agriculture SE in Spelle.Also in 2016, Krone founded the French subsidiary Krone SAS in Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines on a 1.6-hectare site.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\nIn 2018, Krone presented the BiG X 1180 forage harvester, which was the most powerful forage harvester in the world at the time with over 1,156 hp. In 2021, Krone inaugurated the \"Future Lab\", a €20 million test center in Lingen on an area of 13 hectares, which includes a machine hall with workshops, a test hall with test benches and offices and a test track for truck trailers and agricultural machinery. In February 2022, Krone announced that it would be investing €100 million in a new supplier plant in Ibbenbüren. Green Teuto Systemtechnik GmbH (GTS) acts as a supplier and independent company within the Krone Group and manufactures complex welded assemblies for the parent company at the plant. In March 2022, Krone began building a new spare parts and logistics center in Spelle on a 7.5-hectare site at a cost of €40 million. Also in 2022, together with the company Lemken, Krone presented the case study for an autonomous \"proof of concept\" engineering unit, an autonomous diesel-electric agricultural power unit, which is controlled without a driver by remote control or with a tablet PC. The machine had been tested in previous years in the areas of cultivating, plowing, sowing, mowing, turning and swathing.\n\n\n== Company structure ==\nKrone Agriculture acts as the parent company of the agricultural subgroup of the direct parent company Bernard Krone SE & Co. KG and employed 2,195 people in 2021. In the 2022/23 financial year, the company generated revenue of over €1 billion.\n\n\n== Products and markets ==\nIn agricultural technology, Krone Agriculture offers forage harvesting technology products. Krone manufactures machines for contractors, producers and farmers. The company's range includes disc mowers, rotary tedders, round balers and large square balers, rotary rakes, pelleting press, bale wrappers, forage wagons and trailers. The two self-propelled machines, the BiG M mower conditioner and the BiG X forage harvester, are the flagships of the program.Krone Agriculture's main sales markets are Germany, Western and Eastern Europe and North America.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWebsite of the company",

        "content": "Amédée-Louis Hettich, also known as Amédée Landély Hettich and later as Amédée de Hettich (February 5, 1856, Nantes, France – April 5, 1937,  Paris, France) was a French poet, singer, journalist, music teacher, and musicologist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAmédée-Louis Hettich was born in Nantes on February 5, 1856. He studied singing in the class of Jean-Jacques Masset.\nIn 1881, while they were both students at the Conservatoire de Paris, he wanted to marry the composer Mel Bonis, but the composer's family disapproved of the union. Mel Bonis moved in with the Dommange family at 60 rue Monceau, in the heart of the Europe district, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, in 1898. There, she reconnected with Amédée-Louis Hettich. They had a daughter together, Madeleine, who was born on September 7, 1899. \nOn December 3, 1883, Amédée-Louis Hettich performed one of Mel Bonis's melodies, Sur la plage!, for which he had written the lyrics. The event took place at Moscow, who potentially could be the composer Adolphe Blanc.\nAs a poet, he was the muse of Mel Bonis. As a music critic, he wrote for L'Art musical. He wrote critiques of Georges Bizet's Les Pêcheurs de perles, Vincenzo Bellini's I puritani, Jules Massenet's Esclarmonde, Charles Gounod's Mireille, Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Victorin de Joncières's Dimitri, Camille Saint-Saëns's Ascanio, Benjamin Godard's Dante, Alfred Bruneau's Le Rêve, and Ernest Reyer's Sigurd. He also proposed a French adaptation of the Neapolitan love song 'O sole mio, famously sung by Tino Rossi.\nHettich taught singing at the Conservatoire de Paris. Among his students were Madeleine Grey, Charles Panzéra, Arthur Endrèze, and Erling Krogh.\nAmédée-Landely Hettich began in 1906 and published a project of vocal exercises-studies in several volumes. This project spanned nearly 30 years and brought together more than 150 works by composers.\nHe was made a Knight of the Légion d'Honneur in 1922.\nHe died on April 5, 1937, eighteen days after Mel Bonis.\n\n\n== Works ==\nVers à chanter, 1899\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJardin, Étienne (2020).

        "content": "Canada Soccer's National Championships, known as the Toyota National Championships for sponsorship reasons, is an annual amateur soccer competition in Canada. The multi-division competition is hosted in three venues each October: the open-age adult competitions (men's Challenge Trophy and women's Jubilee Trophy); the U-17 Cup competition for boys and girls; and the U-15 Cup competition for boys and girls.\nThe men's competition was originally known as the Dominion of Canada Football Championship when it was inaugurated in 1913 (winners were presented the Connaught Cup). Over time, different divisions have been added, starting with the Youth Championship in 1966. The women's championship was added in 1982.\n\n\n== Amateur eligibility ==\nAs Canada Soccer's premier amateur competition, only Canadian citizens, permanent residents or protected persons may compete in the National Championships. Only amateur players (including reinstated amateurs) may compete in the competition and they must be assigned to their respective clubs by 31 August of that year (or an earlier date if stipulated by the province or territory).\n\n\n== Host cities ==\nCanadian communities have the opportunity to bid on hosting the National Championships. As explained by Canada Soccer, \"events will be organized and executed by Canada Soccer in collaboration with the Local Organizing Committee.\" Bidders are evaluated across nine different categories: Background; Support and partnerships; Facilities; Competition; Finance; Communication, hosting services & activities; Operation Organization; Legacy; and Overall Bid Presentation.\nOnce a Host City is selected, the hosts set up a Local Organizing Committee that stages the competition. Canada Soccer remains the \"rights holder and has the overall responsibility for these events.\"\nThe 2024 Toyota National Championships will be hosted in Surrey, British Columbia (adult competitions), Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (U-17 Cup), and Quinte West, Ontario (U-15 Cup).\n\n\n=== Youth Cup Hosts ===\n\n\n== National championships ==\nSince 2017, Canada Soccer has featured six active divisions at the National Championships. \n\n\n=== Active Divisions - Adult Amateur Championships ===\n\n\n=== Active Divisions - Youth Championships ===\n\n\n=== Retired Divisions - Youth Championships (Club Football) ===\n\n\n=== Retired Divisions - All-Star Selects ===\n\n\n== Other amateur competitions ==\n\n\n=== Canada Games Soccer Tournaments ===\nYouth competitions organized each four years by Canada Games, in conjunction with Canada Soccer, featuring provincial and territorial all-star teams.\n\n\n=== University & College Soccer Championships ===\nUniversity and college competitions organized each year by U Sports and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\n\n=== Futsal Canadian Championship ===\nAdult amateur futsal competition organized each year by Canada Soccer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMen's Amateur Champions for the Challenge Trophy\nWomen's Amateur Champions for the Jubilee Trophy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Parliamentary elections are expected to be held in Nauru by September 2025.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe 19 members of Parliament are elected from eight multi-member constituencies using the Dowdall system, a version of ranked voting; voters rank candidates, with the votes counted as a fraction of one divided by the ranking number (e.g. a candidate ranked second will be scored as 1⁄2); the candidates with the highest total are elected. There are no political parties, so all candidates run as independents. Informal groups do form in Parliament, but membership is fluid. \nParliament is elected for a three-year term, but can be dissolved earlier. The government, which comprises the President and the Cabinet, must retain the support of a majority in Parliament.\nAll citizens aged 20 and older are permitted to cast their ballot; once an individual reaches voting age, they are automatically added to the electoral roll. Voting is compulsory in Nauru; individuals who fail to vote without sufficient reasoning are required to pay a fine. Nauruans who provide proof of illness, are in hospital or are not present in the country on election day are excused. However, Nauruans overseas on the polling day have the option to engage in proxy voting, where an individual assigns someone in Nauru to vote on their behalf. The electoral commission provides a mobile voting service for voters hospitalised or unable to go to polling stations due to incapacity, involving polling staff travelling to these individuals to ensure they can cast their ballot.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fernando Lesme (born 8 April 2002) is a Paraguayan footballer who currently plays for Alajuelense on loan from Municipal Grecia.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nLesme was born in Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay. As a youth, he played for Club 29 de Setiembre, Club Olimpia, and General Caballero Sport Club.  In 2021, he played for the General Caballero first team in the Primera C. Later in 2021, he moved abroad and made his top flight debut at age eighteen with Potros del Este of Panama's LPF. He made twenty-two appearances for the club, scoring five goals, during the Clausura 2021 and Apertura 2022.In May 2022, Lesme then moved to Costa Rica to join Municipal Grecia, originally on loan then permanently, for a reported transfer fee of €225,000. In his first twelve league matches with the club, Lesme scored seven goals, tied for most in the league at that point. He went on to be the league's sole top scorer for the Apertura 2022. In June 2023, with one year left on his deal with Grecia, Lesme went on trial with Celaya F.C. of Mexico's Liga de Expansión MX. The player also reportedly received interest from C.S. Herediano and LD Alajuelense, both of Costa Rica's Liga FPD. Grecia also received an offer from a club in Denmark but the club declined.Lesme was signed by the Mexican club on loan following the trial. He went on to score five goals in fourteen matches. In January 2024, he finally joined Alajuelense on loan ahead of the 2024 Clausura with the deal running through December 2024. In March 2024, Lesme started Alajuelense's 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup Round of 16 match against Major League Soccer's New England Revolution. However, the player fell out of favor when Alexandre Guimarães took over as manager of the club. At the time, Red Star Belgrade, Hellas Verona, and Austin FC were reportedly among the clubs expressing interest in acquiring the frustrated Lesme.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn December 2023, Lesme was called up to the Paraguay national under-23 team for a series of friendlies against Ecuador and Panama.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFernando Lesme at Global Sports Archive\nFernando Lesme at Soccerway",

In this format, the athletes first compete in a cross-country competition that consists of a prologue and several elimination rounds (sprint heats) on a 700–800 meter course. When calculating the points for the ski jumping part, the Mass Start rule is applied, so that the winner of the cross-country part starts last in the ski jumping competition.\nFrom this season, a separate Mass Start Trophy will be introduced, whose winner will receive a mini crystal globe at the end of the season. Also the Nordic Combined Triple will be changed and will consist of a Mass Start, a Compact as well as a Gundersen competition (12.5 km for men, 7.5 km for women) for both genders.\nTwo competitions are planned in Oslo, which will serve as the large hill World Cup premiere of the Nordic Combined women.\n\n\n== Map of world cup hosts ==\nThe following list contains all 10 World Cup hosts of the season.\n\n\n== Men ==\nThe number of events in the World Cup history\n\nafter GUN event in Trondheim (17 March 2024)\n\n\n=== Calendar ===\n\n\n=== Men's team ===\nThe number of events in the World Cup history\n\nafter Sprint in Lahti (2 March 2024)\n\n\n=== Overall leaders ===\n\n\n==== Individual ====\n\n\n==== Nations Cup ====\n\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n\n== Women ==\nThe number of events in the World Cup history\n\nafter GUN event in Trondheim (17 March 2024)\n\n\n=== Calendar ===\n\n\n=== Overall leaders ===\n\n\n==== Individual ====\n\n\n==== Nations Cup ====\n\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n\n== Mixed team ==\nThe number of events in the World Cup history\n\nafter Relay event in Trondheim (16 March 2024)\n\n\n== Provisional competition rounds ==\n\n\n== Podium table by nation ==\nTable showing the World Cup podium places (gold–1st place, silver–2nd place, bronze–3rd place) by the countries represented by the athletes.\n\n\n== Points distribution ==\nThe table shows the number of points won in the 2024–25 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup for men and women. \n\n\n== Achievements ==\nFirst World Cup career victory\n\nFirst World Cup podium\n\nNumber of wins this season (in brackets are all-time wins)\n\n\n== Retirements ==\nThe following notable nordic combined skiers, who competed in the World Cup, are expected to retire during or after the 2024–25 season:\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a benzodiazepine derivative and a partial positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor with two- to four-fold higher functional affinity for the α1 subunit relative to the α2, α3, and α5 subunits.\n\n\n== Medical use ==\nDimdezenil shows effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia, but has less intrinsic activity in comparison to currently-marketed benzodiazepines and the Z-drugs; however, it is thought that the lower efficacy may result in fewer side effects, such as motor incoordination. In China, dimdezenil is approved for short-term treatment of insomnia.\n\n\n== History ==\nDimdezenil was originally developed by Roche, based on preclinical data, as a non-sedating anxiolytic, but was found to produce sedation in humans in phase I clinical trials. For this reason, it was subsequently licensed to Evotec, which is now developing it for the treatment of insomnia. By 2007, dimdezenil completed phase II clinical trials for this indication, with positive findings reported. In China, the drug was developed by Zhejiang Jingxin Pharmaceutical.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDimdazenil - AdisInsight",

        "content": "Irrequieto (English: \"Restless\") was an Italian Indomito-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1913, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign. Reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929, she was stricken in 1937.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nIrrequieto was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, in 1910. She was launched on 12 December 1912, sponsored by Mrs. Blanche Wenner, and commissioned in 1913.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Irrequieto, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Moreno,  and the destroyers Indomito, Impavido, Impetuoso, Insidioso, and Intrepido made up the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. The squadron, under the command of Capitano de fregata (Frigate Captain) P. Orsini, was based at Taranto, although although either Impetuoso or Indomito or both were visiting La Spezia that day.\nOn 9 June 1915, Irrequieto, Impetuoso, Indomito, Insidioso, Intrepido, the protected cruiser Quarto, and the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Ardito, and Audace escorted the armored cruisers  Giuseppe Garibaldi and Vettor Pisani as they participated in a bombardment of the lighthouses at the Cape of Rodon and Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of the Principality of Albania.\nIn the early hours of 17 July 1915 Intrepido, Animoso, Irrequieto, and Quarto bombarded the radiotelegraph station and other Austro-Hungarian military installations on Šipan (known to the Italians as Giuppana), an island off the coast of Dalmatia. The bombardment, as well as another one carried out by the 5th Naval Division, was interrupted when Vettor Pisani of the 5th Naval Division sighted an Austro-Hungarian submarine at 04:25. After the Italian ships began their return voyage to Italy, the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-4 attacked at 04:40 and torpedoed Giuseppe Garibaldi, which sank within minutes. Rescue efforts saved 525 men out of the 578 on board Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nOn 3 December 1915 Irrequieto, Impetuoso , Indomito, Insidioso, and Intrepido got underway from Brindisi to escort one of the first supply convoys for Italian troops in Albania. As the convoy — composed of the troop transports Re Umberto and Valparaiso, carrying a total of 1,800 men and 150 draft animals — approached Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of Albania, Re Umberto, with 765 men on board, hit a mine laid by the Imperial German Navy submarine UC-14, broke in two, and sank in 15 minutes. Rescuers saved 712 men.\n\n\n==== 1916–1918 ====\nOn 24 February 1916, Irrequieto, Impetuoso, Indomito, Ardito, the protected cruisers Libia and Puglia, the auxiliary cruisers Città di Catania and Città di Siracusa, and the destroyer Bersagliere and began to bombard advancing Austro-Hungarian troops in Albania who were about to occupy Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo). In the following days they also bombarded Austro-Hungarian artillery positions on the mountain Sasso Bianco in the Dolomites near Durrës.\nOn 25 June 1916 Irrequieto, Impavido, Insidioso, Audace, and the protected cruiser Marsala operated in distant support of an attack by the motor torpedo boats MAS 5 and MAS 7 against Durrës. The attack resulted in serious damage to the 1,111-gross register ton steamship Sarajevo.\nOn 9 July 1916 Irrequieto (now under the command of an officer named Ponza di San Martino) and Impetuoso set out in pursuit of the Austro-Hungarian scout cruiser Novara, which had attacked the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto and sunk the naval drifters — armed fishing boats that patrolled anti-submarine barriers — Astrum, Claivis, and Spei, but Novara reached the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro before they could intercept her.\nOn 11 June 1917 Irrequieto, Insidioso, and the torpedo boats Airone and Ardea provided distant support to 10 Italian seaplanes sent to bomb Durrës.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with the armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nAfter the end of World War I, Irrequieto′s armament was revised, giving her five 102 mm (4 in)/35-caliber guns, a single 40 mm (1.6 in)/35-caliber gun, and four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes. She was reclassified as a torpedo boat in 1929. She was stricken from the naval register on 11 October 1937 and subsequently discarded and scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Hector De Claire (1836–1906) was a French-American tailor. Born into a Catholic family in Lille, he became a socialist and a freethinker at an early age. He emigrated to the United States, where he became a US citizen after fighting for the Union Army in the American Civil War. He plied his trade as an itinerant worker in Michigan, where he married Harriet Elizabeth Billings and had three children: Marion, Adelaide and Voltairine. After Marion's death at a young age, the family moved to St. Johns, where they lived in extreme poverty. In order to find better work, he left his family and moved to Port Huron, where he was later joined by his daughter Voltairine. He paid for her education at a Catholic school in Canada, after which he resumed itinerant labor and later retired to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he died.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nHector De Claire was born in 1836, in the Northern French city of Lille. Raised in a Catholic family, he developed a deep sense of skepticism from an early age. By the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848, he had also adopted his father's socialist politics. In 1854, De Claire turned eighteen and decided to emigrate to the United States, along with his brother. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, they volunteered to fight in the Union Army, for which they were consequently granted citizenship of the United States.\n\n\n=== Family life in Michigan ===\nDe Claire moved to Michigan and took up work as a tailor, moving between towns as a migrant worker. While he was in Kalamazoo, he met Harriet Elizabeth Billings, whom he married on March 28, 1861. They moved to Leslie, where they had three daughters: Marion (b. May 26, 1862), Adelaide (b. March 10, 1864) and Voltairine (b. November 17, 1866). Despite protests from his Puritan wife, he named their youngest after the French philosopher Voltaire; Adelaide later speculated that it was because he had wanted a boy.\nIn May 1867, their daughter Marion died, having accidentally drowned in a river. The loss of their first child was psychologically devastating for the De Claires, who subsequently decided to move away to a small house in St. Johns. The family was plunged into extreme poverty, with Hector attempting to make a living as a tailor, while Harriet worked as a seamstress in order to support their income. Despite the financial difficulties, they managed to pay for their daughters' meager food, clothing and education. But their situation caused friction between the De Claire couple, with Hector becoming increasingly bitter and demanding over the years. In a letter to the anarchist printer Joseph Ishill, Adelaide recalled that Hector's life had been \"such a disappointment to himself\". Although she said that \"in his way he was kind to us\", she also spoke of his \"impulsive nature\", while his future grandson Harry went so far as to call him a \"petty tyrant\"; in letters to Voltairine, he repeatedly scolded her for writing in pencil.\n\n\n=== Move to Port Huron ===\nTheir financial situation got even worse during the early 1870s, as Hector found it more difficult to find work in St. Johns, where many people practiced sewing at home and had no need of a tailor. He returned again to itinerant labor, eventually settling down in Port Huron. He never returned home to St. Johns, but sent money back to his family when he could. Separation from his daughters made them even more unhappy. In 1879, Voltairine was sent to live with him in Port Huron, after Adelaide became seriously ill and their mother was unable to care for them both. But the adolescent Voltairine hated the city and frequently expressed her wish to return home, despite Hector's attempts to cheer her up with Sunday visits to the local park. As he worked twelve-hour days and was unable to cope with parenting a teenage girl, in September 1880, he decided to enroll her in a Convent in the Canadian city of Sarnia. Hippolyte Havel speculated that it was Hector's intention for Voltairine to become a nun, but this assertion was rejected by both Adelaide and Voltairine's own biographer Paul Avrich.\nDe Claire hoped that the convent would discipline his daughter with its rules and regulations, and \"cure her\" of her love of idle reading. But he also recognized Voltairine's intelligence and wanted to provide her with the best education he could, working long hours in order to pay for her tuition and accomodation; according to Adelaide, her nearly \"crippled him[self] financially.\" Voltairine never understood her father's decision to send her there and never forgave him for doing so. Within weeks she attempted to escape the convent, but was brought back by her father. Hector informed Harriet that she would need to censor herself while writing to their daughter, as the nuns closely monitored all correspondence. When the nuns kept one of Adelaide's letters from reaching Voltairine, Hector had to intervene for them to release it to her. When Voltairine was allowed to visit Hector in Port Huron, she seized the opportunity to pen an uncensored letter to her mother, without the nuns being able to read it.\n\n\n=== Later life, death and memory ===\nOnce Voltairine was seventeen, she graduated from the convent and returned home to St. Johns. Soon after, Hector left Port Huron. He converted back to Catholicism and returned to itinerant work, drifting again between the various towns of Michigan. He moved from Flint, back to Port Huron, then on to Lansing, before heading west to settle in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he spent the final years of his life. Hector De Claire died on May 27, 1906, aged seventy-one, at the Milwaukee Soldiers Home. He died having not seen his daughter Adelaide in two decades; she later described him as a \"poor old man\". His other daughter Voltairine, who at the time was recovering from a severe illness, wrote to her mother that \"He hadn't much out of his life either, had he?\"\nDe Claire's daughter, Voltairine de Cleyre, attributed her \"opposition to things as they are\" in part to her father's socialist politics. His other daughter, Adelaide D. Thayer, described him as a \"brilliant man\". In her biographical essay on Voltairine de Cleyre, Emma Goldman erroneously listed Hector as \"August de Cleyre\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

He is known for his photography work, documenting the human experience and cultural diversity across decades and continents. \nHe is also the co-founder of Tofu Magazine, which he curated during his time in Hong Kong. \n\n\n== Life and Education ==\nBenoit Dupuis was born in Auxerre, France. He studied photography at the National School of Fine Arts in Bourges in 1976. During his time in school he formed a friendship with fellow artist Philippe Batrosse, sharing a mutual interest in art and rebellion against traditional education. Feeling constrained by the academic environment, Dupuis and Batrosse relocated to Paris in 1977, immersing themselves in the emerging punk scene.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDupuis's early years in Paris were characterized by his involvement in the punk community, during which he documented the energy and creativity of the era. In 1979, he relocated to San Francisco, encountering a new wave of artistic expression which fueled a passion for exploration and prompted extensive travels throughout Mexico and the United States.\nIn 1984, Dupuis's trajectory shifted when he met Rudi Stern, owner of the Let There Be Neon gallery in New York City. Becoming the designer for the gallery's Paris branch, Dupuis temporarily diverted from photography to focus on visual arts and design.\nFollowing studies in painting in Brussels and Venice, Dupuis pursued a career as a freelance artist, specializing in large-scale murals and architectural trompe-l'oeil. \n\n\n=== Tofu Magazine ===\nIn 1996, he moved to Hong Kong and in 1999 he co-founded the cross-cultural magazine Tofu Magazine with graphic designer Daniel Gé. This venture marked the onset of Dupuis's deeper engagement with Asia and its diverse cultural milieu. \n\n\n=== Later work ===\nIn 2008, Dupuis moved to Japan and returned to photography. Since then, he has worked on several photographic projects focusing on Asia's landscapes, people, and cultures. His portfolio covers various subjects, including Tokyo's urban environment and Cambodia's natural environment. He has also created a series of photographs of the so-called \"homeless\" who call the broad banks of the Arakawa River, in Tokyo's east, their home.\nIn 2020 he documented the demonstrations taking place in Hong Kong with his \"Action Painting\" series.   \n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n2008 - Bophana Audiovisual Resource Center in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n2010 - Des Photographes, des Japons exhibition at the Institut Franco Japonais in Tokyo, Japan\n2016 - Yakushima Photography Festival in Yakushima, Japan.\n2023 - Fotozofio slideshow exhibition in Kyoto, Japan\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== External Links ===\nOfficial website\nTofu Magazine",

        "content": "A Play of Giants is a play by Wole Soyinka, Africa's  first Nobel Prize winner in 1986.  \"A Play of Giants\"  is a satire that takes aim at dictators in Africa, including the notorious Idi Amin. Set at the  New York embassy, the play ingeniously portrays a gathering of dictatorial African leaders, highlighting their absurdities and follies as they attempt to navigate cooperation and decision-making. Through sharp wit and clever dialogue, the play offers a scathing commentary on power, politics, and the human condition, inviting audiences to reflect on the nature of tyranny and its impact on society. published on  January 1, 1984\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe play is set at the  Bulgara Embassy in New York City, adorned with decorations and displays of wealth. In the center stands a sculptor, attempting to capture the likeness of African tyrants. Enter Gunema,  Kasco representing, Kamini, and Tuboum  with each representing a country as listed respectively Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Uganda, Congo/Zaïre, accompanied by their entourage of sycophants and advisors. They exude an air of arrogance and self-importance as they survey the scene.\nKamini, one of the main cast of the play(charismatic host), takes center stage, regaling the others with his grandiose tales of conquest and power. Despite his charm, there is an underlying sense of unease among the group, as they constantly fret over the stability of their regimes back home. As the sculptor struggles to immortalize the tyrants in stone, they offer unsolicited advice and criticism, revealing their vanity and insecurity. Meanwhile, their Western admirers, including the Scandinavian journalist Gudrun and Professor Batey, fawn over them with feigned admiration.\nThe absurdity reaches new heights as the African leaders grapple with their own delusions of grandeur. Gunema attempts to solve his country's financial woes by simply printing more money, while Kasco declares himself above politics, embracing absolute power as emperor. Amidst the chaos, Kamini emerges as the central figure, his erratic behavior keeping everyone on edge. Despite his bluster, he is haunted by the specter of betrayal, as his once-loyal followers begin to defect in the face of his tyranny. Meanwhile, representatives of the US and USSR make an appearance, their indifference to African suffering highlighting the cynical geopolitics of the Cold War era. As the play reaches its climax, the façade of power begins to crumble. Kamini, desperate to maintain control, resorts to increasingly brutal tactics, alienating even those who once supported him. In a moment of rare engagement, Kasco reflects on the nature of power and politics, questioning whether his fellow tyrants are truly free or merely trapped by their own ambitions.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nBenefacio Gunema, inspired by Macias Nguema, a character that constantly seeks validation and adulation, but underneath his bravado lies a deep insecurity as he struggles to control his failing regime. Gunema's tendency to resort to extreme measures to silence dissent only isolates him further. Despite his flaws, there's a tragic aspect to Gunema, haunted by his past atrocities and consumed by his own insecurities.\nEmperor Kasco, modeled after Jean-Baptiste Bokassa, embodies relentless pursuit of absolute power. He exudes regal authority, relishing in the symbols of his self-proclaimed empire. Kasco views himself as beyond the mundane concerns of politics, believing himself to be a divine ruler chosen by fate. Despite his outward confidence, he harbors deep-seated paranoia, constantly purging perceived threats to his reign. Kasco's methods include brutal repression and manipulation, reflecting his willingness to do whatever it takes to maintain control. However, beneath his facade of strength lies a fragile ego, easily wounded by dissent.\nField-Marshal Kamini,  inspired by Idi Amin, is a charismatic yet brutal leader. Known for his charm and cruelty, he effortlessly commands loyalty while manipulating the fears of his subordinates. Despite projecting strength, Kamini is deeply insecure and paranoid, ruling through fear and violence to maintain power. Beneath his facade lies a troubled soul haunted by past atrocities.\nGeneral Barra Tuboum, inspired by Mobutu Sese Seko, a cunning and ruthless character. He commands respect through quiet authority, always staying ahead of his adversaries with masterful strategy. Tuboum is a pragmatic realist, unhampered by moral concerns, viewing power as the ultimate goal. He is willing to betray allies and sacrifice anything to satisfy his ambition for power. Despite his calm exterior, Tuboum harbors an insatiable thirst for dominance.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner is a 1980 live album by Mark Murphy.\nWild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner is the 49th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 48 years old and released by the HighNotes Records label in the United States in 2017, two years after his death. The release is a varied collection of tunes and styles associated with Murphy over the span of his career from the 1950s up to 1980.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the time of this live set, Murphy was enjoying one of the high points of his career at 48 years old. James Gavin points out in the liner notes that the 1978 Stolen Moments album on Muse had been a success and the title track, with Murphy's own lyrics, had received a lot of airplay. Vocalese was enjoying a new level of interest thanks to the success of The Manhattan Transfer and the career revival of Eddie Jefferson. Furthermore, his 1979 album Satisfaction Guaranteed was up for a 1980 Grammy award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 23rd annual awards. This was Murphy's first nomination for a vocal performance and it lost to George Benson, for Moody's Mood. Soon he would record his landmark release Bop for Kerouac.  \n\n\n== Recording ==\nMark Murphy recorded the tracks during a live concert at the Keystone Korner jazz club in San Francisco in June 1980, three years before the club closed. He had been performing extensively in the San Francisco Bay Area. Here he performs with some of his Bay area favorites at the time including his steady pianist Paul Potyen, drummer Jack Gobbetti, bassist Peter Barshay, and Babatunde Lea on percussion. Club owner Todd Barkan produced the release. \nThe tunes reflect Murphy's career up to that point, from the 1950s (\"Body and Soul\") to the then present (\"I Return to Music\" on Satisfaction Guaranteed), from ballads to bebop to Brazilian jazz. Songs from his Riverside years and his Muse years were included.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPeter Jones calls the release, \"a varied and fascinating set\" full of \"musical daring\", varied settings and changes in tempo. James Gavin says, \"It captures him in what may have been his finest period. His singing is fresh, mature, and just wild enough, with a control and discipline he often abandoned in later years. His creativity is on fire, his heart wide open\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"I Return to Music\" (Kirby Shaw) – 5:53\n\"Farmer's Market\" (Art Farmer, Annie Ross) – 2:46\n\"Spring Medley: It Might as Well Be Spring / Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most\" (Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II / Tommy Wolf, Fran Landesman) – 6:27\n\"Stompin' at the Savoy\" (Benny Goodman, Edgar Sampson, Chick Webb, Andy Razaf) – 5:31\n\"You Fascinate Me So\" (Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh) – 3:40\n\"Bijou\" (Ralph Burns, Jon Hendricks) – 3:30\n\"Fiesta in Blue\" (Goodman, Jimmy Mundy) – 3:08\n\"Body and Soul\" (Johnny Green, Frank Eyton, Edward Heyman, Robert Sour) – 5:35\n\"Waters of March\" (Antônio Carlos Jobim) – 3:37\n\"Laugh Clown Laugh / Send in the Clowns\" (Richard Andrew Thorburn / Stephen Sondheim) – 2:50\n\"Charleston Alley\" (Hamish Henderson, Hendricks, Leroy Kirkland) – 2:30\n\"Blues in the Night\" (Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer) – 4:28\n\"I've Got You Under My Skin\" (Cole Porter) – 4:35\n\"Don't Be Blue\" (Michael Franks, John Guerin) – 3:40\nIntroducing the Band – 1:04\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals,\nPeter Barshay – bass\nBabatunde Lea – percussion\nPaul Potyen – piano\nJack Gobbetti – drums\nProduction\nJon Rosenberg – engineer, co-producer, mastering, editing\nTodd Barkan – producer\nJoe Fields – co-producer\nBrian McMillen – photography\nKeiji Obata – design\nJames Gavin – liner notes\nTory Sanoa – tape to digital transfers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner at MusicBrainz (release group)\nWild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner at Discogs (release)\nWild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner at AllMusic (release)\nWild and Free: Live at the Keystone Korner at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in MusicHound Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Penguin Guide to Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide at Internet Archive\nTed Pankin Mark Murphy interviews and liner notes.",

He entered the state parliament via the AfD's second place on the list and is deputy chairman of the AfD parliamentary group there.\nSchledde is a member of the district council of the county of Bentheim and a member of the city council of Schüttorf.\nIn Early April 2024 Schledde declared that he wanted to become chairman of the AfD regional association for Lower Saxony. He will stand for election at the state party conference in 2024. According to Die Zeit, Schledde is considered the \"mastermind of the regional association\".\n\n\n== Criminal investigations ==\nThe former AfD MP Christopher Emden told the NDR that he had been offered to pay an amount of 4,000 euros in order to get support for the nomination for the next state election. The account details for the \"war chest\" were that of Schledde. He made the alleged \"slush fund\" public. Schledde applied for an injunction against him, but this was dismissed.\nOn the morning of April 17, 2024, the state parliament lifted Schledde's immunity as a member of parliament. From 9 a.m., the police searched two AfD offices in Schledde on behalf of the Hanover public prosecutor's office. This was about the initial suspicion of violating the party's law. Several AfD officials transferred a total of 48,000 Euro to Schledde's private account, which he neither forwarded as a party donation nor declare as required.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miyako no Yoshika (都良香; 834–879) was a Japanese poet, scholar and court official active in the Heian period. He was responsible for the civil service examination of Sugawara no Michizane and later acted as one of the compilers of the Nihon Montoku Tennō Jitsuroku. Many documents prepared by him, as well as a number of his poems, were collected in a volume known as Toshi Bunshū (都氏文集), which only survives in fragments. He became the subject of a number of legends describing his encounters with supernatural beings, such as the oni of Rashōmon and the goddess Benzaiten, as well as with pursuit of immortality.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nYoshika was a son of Miyako no Sadutsugu (都貞継) and a nephew of Miyako no Haraaka (都腹赤), an official and poet active during the reign of emperor Saga. According to Robert Borgen, Yoshika's family was \"hardly eminent\" overall, but his uncle served as a professor of literature from 821 to 829 and might have influenced his early career. In 860 Yoshika began studying in the Shikibu-shō. According to Ōe no Masafusa he showed exceptional skill as a student. After completing his studies he was appointed to various administrative positions in the provinces of Aki and Harima.\n\n\n=== Appointment as a lesser private secretary ===\nIn 870 Yoshika became a lesser private secretary (少内記, shōnaiki). His duties included preparing draft documents for the emperor, as well as conducting university entrance and civil service examinations.\nYoshika served as the examiner of Sugawara no Michizane. While according to a legend present in many historical biographies of Michizane Yoshika first met him at a banquet he organized, during which he declared that his archery skills are a sign he will perform well in his upcoming examination, there is no evidence such an event ever occurred. While it was considered customary in contemporary China for the relationship between an official and his former examiner to be cordial, in Japan this was uncommon, and typically the examiner and his examinees belonged to different scholarly circles, and there was no expectation of loyalty developing between them based on successful examination. In his evaluation of Michizane's essays submitted as a part of this procedure Yoshika critically evaluated what he saw as insufficiently rigorous sourcing of cited Buddhist texts, improperly identified Chinese names, as well as numerous grammatical errors, and granted him the lowest passing grade permitted by the ritsuryō code. However, Borgen stresses that Yoshika's judgment was not unusually harsh, and awarding low passing grades to candidates was the norm through the entire ninth century and did not mean the examiners saw them as unskilled. In his evaluation, Yoshika also praised Michizane's style despite his objections. They subsequently shared the same offices multiple times. In 871 they have been entrusted with determining together if emperor Seiwa should follow his late grandmother's wish to not be mourned to the full extent expected by tradition. However, according to Borgen they  were not on friendly terms, possibly because Michizane's dissatisfaction with Yoshika's harsh evaluation of his examination answers.\nKi no Haseo studied under Yoshika for a time. It has been argued that he was his main disciple.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn 872 Yoshika took part in the reception of an embassy from Balhae. He also studied esoteric Buddhist doctrine in Tō-ji. In 875 he was appointed to the position of a professor of literature and subsequently took part in the compilation of Nihon Montoku Tennō Jitsuroku. While it is agreed he was a major contributor, he passed away before it was completed.\n\n\n=== Descendants ===\nAccording to the Gōdanshō, a late Heian collection of anecdotes and poetry commentaries by Ōe no Masafusa and Fujiwara no Sanekane, Yoshika had a son named Arinaka (在中) who became a poet and scholar like him, but the dates of his birth and death are unknown.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThrough his courtly career Miyako no Yoshika composed poetry. Anecdotes preserved in the Gōdanshō, Kokon Chomonjū and Jikkinshō indicate he was particularly renowned for his kanshi (poems composed in Chinese), though he also wrote waka. His style was influenced by Bai Juyi, a Chinese poet whose works were transmitted in Japan in the middle of the ninth century. Yoshika's kanbun writings were compiled into a collection known as Toshi Bunshū (都氏文集), which originally consisted of six volumes, though only three survive today. Most of the remaining sections are compilations official documents, such as examination questions and evaluations, while most of the poems have been lost. However, examples of Yoshika's poetry are preserved in collections such as Honchō Monzui, Fusōshū, Wakan Rōeishū and Kokin Wakashū.\nTwo other of Yoshika's works, Shinsen Saku (神仙策; \"Plan of the Immortals\") and Fujisan-ki (富士山記; \"Records of Mount Fuji\"), reflect his interest in legends about Daoist immortals. The latter work describes Mount Fuji as the dwelling of female immortals. It is also the oldest description of its crater and might indicate that it has already been climbed in the Heian period.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\n\n=== Encounter with an oni ===\n\nMultiple variants of a legend about a meeting between Miyako no Yoshika and an oni exist. According to Mori Masato, the oldest example, which involves the oni of Rashōmon, can be found in the Gōdanshō. However, in this version no meeting occurs: while the tale deals with the oni being moved by a poem composed by Yoshika, he hears it when a nameless horseman recites it while passing under the gate. A similar legend can be found in the Honchō Shinsen-den (本朝神仙伝; \"Accounts of Japanese Immortals\"), though there the oni resides in Suzakumon rather than Rashōmon. In other variants the oni meets Yoshika himself, and the poem is presented as the result of cooperation between them. In the Wakan Rōeishū Shichū (和漢朗詠集私註; \"Private commentaries on Japanese and Chinese poems to sing\"), originally written in 1161, Yoshika encounters the oni of Rashōmon, who hears him reciting an unfinished poem and is moved by it to such a degree that he finishes it himself. A similar variant can be found in the Jikkinshō. After the encounter Yoshika presents the poem to Sugawara no Michizane, who is able to tell part of it was composed by an oni. Further similar versions are known from thirteenth century Senjūshō and early sixteenth century Hokekyō Shūrin Shūyōshō (法華經鷲林拾葉鈔; \"Commentary on Lotus Sutra, Collected from Vulture Woods\"), though the oni resides in Suzakumon in them, which according to Noriko Reider might indicate a degree of confusion or interchangeability between legends about Yoshika and Ki no Haseo, as tales about the latter encountering an oni interested in fine arts at either Suzakumon or Rashōmon are also known.\n\n\n=== Attaining immortality ===\nMiyako no Yoshika is portrayed as a Daoist immortal in the Honchō Shinsen-den compiled by Ōe no Masafusa at an uncertain date before 1109. The original manuscript does not survive, and the oldest known copy dates back to 1356. While the individual tales included in it are classified as setsuwa by researchers, they lack didactic and moralistic messages. They combine Buddhist and Daoist elements. According to Christoph Kleine and Livia Kohn it is possible that Masafusa aimed to create a Japanese equivalent of Chinese compilations of legends about immortals out of intellectual curiosity and national pride, as opposed to religious conviction. Yoshika and Tachibana no Masamichi are the only literati among the described immortals. Kleine notes that the stories about them are the most similar to the Chinese model of pursuit of immortality. Their inclusion might also reflect Masafusa's need to show that members of his profession were also capable of attaining it.\nAccording to Masafusa, Yoshika was born in Kyoto and from a young age displayed unusual physical abilities, such as being able to run faster than a galloping horse. He first decided to become an \"eccentric immortal\" after spending a night with the concubine of his examiner, lord Yoshinawa. He subsequently attained success first as a student, and then as a scholar and poet. However, he only started to pursue immortality when Sugawara no Michizane was appointed to a higher position than him despite being one of his examinees, which caused him to quit courtly life and enter the mountains in hopes of encountering immortals. In reality, while there is evidence that Yoshika and Michizane were not on friendly terms, the former died prematurely at the age of 46 two months after the latter's promotion. Masafusa states that while nobody knows what happened to Yoshika, he has been sighted a century later in a mountain cave, showing no signs of aging. His immortality is explained as a result of practicing methods of the immortals (仙法, senpō). However, it is left unexplained what they entailed.\nIn addition to describing Yoshika himself as an immortal, Masafusa also cites his lost work Yoshinosan-ki (吉野山記, \"Record of Mount Yoshino\") as a source in his account of En no Gyōja's deeds; since the legend differs from more widespread versions, it is possible he saw his work as possessing unique literary value.\nA different legend portraying Yoshika as an immortal describes his meeting with Benzaiten at Chikubu Island. As recorded in Fukurozōshi and Jikkinshō, he began composing a poem while visiting a shrine dedicated to her, but could not finish it until the goddess revealed a suitable ending to him in the form of an oracle. Bernard Faure suggests the tale might be related to a legend recorded in Fusō Kogo Ryōishū (扶桑古語霊異集), in which Yoshika visited the village of Hira at the shore of lake Biwa in 865, and encountered a white-haired old man (possibly the local deity Shirahige Myōjin) who taught him about various events from the history of the Ise and Hie shrines.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The TALQ Protocol is an interface standard for smart city device networks, enabling interoperability between central management software (CMS) and outdoor device networks (ODN) from different vendors.\n\n\n== TALQ Protocol ==\nThe TALQ Smart City Protocol (TALQ Protocol/TALQ Specification) is a communication protocol enabling the connection of various different outdoor device networks (ODN) with a central management software (CMS). The protocol is defined with the OpenAPI Specification, it follows the RESTful approach with JSON data and is built on TCP/IP and HTTPS.It was originally a protocol for smart street lighting, but later expanded to include other smart city applications. The protocol is considered a global standard for smart city/IoT and the authority of the TALQ standard has been acknowledged internationally.\n\n\n=== History ===\nTALQ was created in 2012 to address and solve issues within outdoor lighting systems; unifying the languages used between the physical devices (e.g.: lamp post, luminaire controller), and the CMS, as different manufacturers used different protocols within outdoor lighting networks (OLN). TALQ introduced the TALQ Bridge (later called Gateway) which identifies the OLN and translates the information to the CMS.Later, in 2017, the objective broadened to include other smart city applications as well. In 2021, the TALQ Protocol was released as a public resource on GitHub.\n\n\n=== Development and operating principle ===\nThe TALQ Gateway represents the ODN data and translates this information into messages that can be understood by the CMS. These messages are created as per the TALQ data model and expressed in JSON.TALQ is network technology-agnostic within the ODN, it provides a common interface represented by the Gateway and the CMS. The functionality of a physical device, like a luminaire controller for a streetlamp, is represented by a set of functions with associated attributes and events. An exemplary function for a luminaire controller is the LampActuator function, in which the commands and events associated attributes are contained. The TALQ Protocol provides several such functions. When designing a new physical device, these functions can be used, or new functions can be designed by extending previously existing ones.Those vendor-specific functions enable differentiation between manufacturers.\n\n\n=== Features ===\nThis protocol is not only limited to lighting, but can also be used for other smart city applications like e.g. waste and parking space management, traffic monitoring, energy management or environmental data collection. The supported features include, among others, scheduling, sensor-based control, configuration, monitoring, asset management, event handling, energy savings, failure notifications, and maintenance optimization.When establishing smart city applications like traffic monitoring, waste management, or smart street lighting, the TALQ standard enables cities and utilities to avoid vendor lock-in by having the choice among various compatible systems.\n\n\n== TALQ Consortium ==\nThe TALQ Consortium was founded in 2012 by the six lighting companies Philips (since renamed Signify N.V.), Zumtobel, Schréder, Harvard Engineering, Streetlight Vision and Kingsun. In the following years, further companies, such as Osram and GE Lighting, joined the consortium, and in 2021, the consortium reached 50 members. The objective of the consortium was to advance in the outdoor lighting market by creating a standardized communication protocol for smart street lighting.The consortium's areas of responsibility are the managing and the further evolution of the TALQ Smart City Protocol. This includes delivering and governing the interface specification, as well as managing its promotion and approving the compliance with a certification procedure.In its certification process, the consortium evaluates manufacturers' adherence to the TALQ interface standard for both completeness and correctness, utilizing the online TALQ certification tool (TCT) to ensure robust implementation. To use the TCT and receive certifications, vendors have to join the consortium. Manufacturers of products that successfully integrated the standard have been approved and officially certified by the consortium since 2017.The consortium is a member program of the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (IEEE-ISTO), a non-profit organization for the development of standards within technology industry consortia, trade associations, and other similar entities.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe TALQ Protocol on GitHub\nList of TALQ-certified products",

        "content": "Lake Brasimone (Italian: Lago del Brasimone; also known as the Scalere basin and the Brasimone basin) is an artificial lake located on the Bolognese Apennines along the Brasimone stream, in the municipal territory of Camugnano and is included within the Suviana and Brasimone. \n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the construction of the reservoir was taken into consideration by the growing demand for electricity for domestic and industrial uses by the city of Bologna.\nThe project, born from an intuition of the engineer. Fausto Baratta, was presented to the Civil Engineers on 24 April 1906.\nIn 1910, the Società Bolognese di Elettricità (SBE), on behalf of the Società Strade Ferrate Meridionali of Florence, started work on the construction of the dam near the Scalere mill, where the Brasimone valley narrowed and the stream formed a suggestive series of jumps, while at the same time the hydroelectric power station of Santa Maria was built further downstream, near the ancient church of the same name.\nOn 27 April 1910, the excavation works were completed, while on 1 November 1911, after just 15 months and the employment of around 1200 labourers, the dam was completed and the roads running along the two banks were connected. \nThe realization of the project brought about a new layout of the territory and notable transformations of the landscape, but it also allowed the passage of a new road that connected Castiglione to Riola passing through Camugnano, allowing the Porrettana and the Bologna-Pistoia railway to be reached.\nIn 1917 a further barrier on the Brasimone will be placed downstream of Castiglione dei Pepoli by the construction of the Santa Maria dam, 23 meters high and built by the Arturo Pagani company to serve the Le Piane hydroelectric power station.\nIn the 70s, the waters of the Brasimone were brought into contact with the underlying Lake Suviana, through the construction of two imposing pipelines and the pumping system of the Bargi hydroelectric power station.\nIn the same period, the ENEA Brasimone Research Center was built on its south-eastern coast in which, according to an Italian-French project on fast sodium nuclear reactors, a reactor was to be built for PEC (Fuel Element Test) scientific experimentation,a liquid sodium refrigerated fast reactor designed for testing the behavior of fuel elements.\nThe works began in 1972 but, following the Chernobyl accident and the political will that developed after the 1987 referendum, a process of reconversion and repurposing of both the available resources and professional skills began.\nIn 1995, the area was included in the context of the Suviana and Brasimone Lakes Regional Park.\n\n\n== Geology and hydrology ==\nThe gorges that the Brasimone torrent has carved, for a long stretch, at the foot of the western slope of Monte Gatta, are a peculiar erosive morphology deepened in the turbidite sandstones of the Castiglione dei Pepoli Formation.\nThe alternation between arenaceous-marly lithotypes, solid and poorly erodible, and other clayey ones, favored the setting up of the Brasimone artificial hydroelectric basin with the water retention dam founded on substantial arenaceous-marly rock outcrops, and with the reservoir developed in the clayey band behind. The power basin is composed entirely of firm arenaceous-marly soils, a characteristic which inhibits erosion, providing long-lasting guarantees to the hydroelectric basin.\nThe lake also collects the waters of the Torto stream, which always flows into it from the area between Monte Calvi and Monte Casciaio.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nThe valley incision in which the lake rises emerges within a mixed forest with oak, chestnut, ash and hornbeam.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Ghulam al-Khallal (Arabic: غلام الخلال, died 973), full name Abu Bakr 'Abd al-Aziz ibn Ja'far, was a Muslim Hanbali scholar and theologian. He was a close student of Abu Bakr al-Khallal, hence he received his name Ghulam, which means assistant. Ghulam al-Khallal was also a trustworthy narrator of Hadith.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGhulam al-Khallal was born in 898. Not much is known about his early life. He is known to have been a companion of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school of thought. The historian Al-Dhahabi praised him, saying that “no one came after the companions of Ahmad like Ghulam al-Khallal, and no one came after him in turn like Abdul Aziz, unless he was Abu al-Qasim al-Kharaqani.” Ghulam al-Khallal was also a Hadith narrator, and scholars including Ibn Battah narrated from him.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGhulam al-Khallal died in the year 973, and was buried in Baghdad, Iraq. His grave is believed to be located in the mausoleum room of the Al-Khilani Mosque which is now a Shi'ite shrine dedicated to the Shi'ite saint Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Uthman. Modern historians including Imad Abd al-Salam Rauf and Yunus as-Samarrai have identified the grave in the mausoleum as belonging to Ghulam al-Khallal. \n\n\n== See also ==\nHanbali school of thought\nAbu Bakr al-Khallal\nList of Atharis\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Major General Carl-Gustaf Ståhl (15 November 1920 – 11 April 2016) was a Swedish Army officer. Ståhl's military career began in 1940 when he joined the Military Academy Karlberg in Stockholm, graduating in 1942 as a second lieutenant. Over the years, he underwent further training and rose through the ranks, serving in various capacities within the Swedish military. Notably, he commanded the third Swedish battalion in Cyprus as part of the UN Peacekeeping Force and later served as a military attaché in Washington, D.C., and Ottawa. Promoted to major general in 1972, he held significant roles in the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration before entering the reserves in 1982. Ståhl's international service continued as he commanded the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Damascus from 1982 to 1985, achieving notable success in facilitating a prisoner exchange between Syria and Israel. Post-retirement, he contributed to educational initiatives on behalf of the Swedish Ecclesiastical Educational Association, receiving recognition for his work on the Middle East Project.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nStåhl was born on 15 November 1920 in Copenhagen, Denmark, the son of Torsten Ståhl and his wife Siri (née Maniette). He grew up in Copenhagen with two siblings. His father was the director of Cederslunds Punch in Denmark. Ståhl passed studentexamen in Copenhagen in 1939. Ståhl dreamed of becoming an engineer, but World War II put an end to that dream. Instead, he was mobilized for military service with the Göta Engineer Regiment in Eksjö. As the war seemed to be prolonged, he sought officer training.\n\n\n== Career ==\nStåhl enrolled at the Military Academy Karlberg in Stockholm in 1940. He attended the same class as the future Chief of the Army Staff, Major General Gösta Hökmark. Ståhl graduated in 1942 and was commissioned as an officer the same year and was assigned as a second lieutenant into the Swedish Engineer Troops. He studied at the Engineer Officers' School (Ingenjörofficersskolan) in 1945 and attended the Advanced Course at the Artillery and Engineering College from 1947 to 1949.

He attended the General Course at the Swedish National Defence College in 1962. After being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1963, he served as acting commander of the Göta Engineer Regiment from 1963 to 1964.On 12 October 1964, Ståhl succeeded Colonel Jonas Wærn as commander of the third Swedish battalion of 894 men in Cyprus, part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). He served in this position until April 1965. On 1 April 1966 he was promoted to colonel. After that, he served as a military attaché at the embassies in Washington, D.C., and Ottawa from 1966 to 1972 and attended the Senior Staff Course at the Swedish National Defence College in 1972. Ståhl was chairman of the Swedish Defence Automobile Association (Försvarets motorklubb, FMK) in the 1970s and the 1980s.After his promotion to major general in 1972, he served at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration from 1972 to 1982: as head of Central Planning from 1972 to 1974 and as head of the Main Army Materiel Department from 1974 to 1982. Ståhl entered the reserves in 1982. On 5 May 1982, Ståhl was appointed commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), with headquarters in Damascus, with effect from 1 June 1982, replacing Major General Erkki R. Kaira of Finland. UNDOF consisted of approximately 1,200 personnel with the main forces from Finland, Austria, Canada, and Poland. His greatest success was the prisoner exchange between Syria and Israel. Ståhl served as commander of UNDOF until 1985.Ståhl served as a consultant to the Swedish Ecclesiastical Educational Association (SKS) from 1987 to 1998. In 1990, Ståhl and Bishop Emeritus Olle Nivenius each received SKS's cultural prize. Ståhl received his prize for the SKS Middle East Project, including authoring study materials about the Arab–Israeli conflict and the role of the United Nations in the Middle East.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1943, Ståhl married Margaretha Engdahl (1920–2001), the daughter of Gunnar Engdahl and Signe (née Sörensen). They had two children: Gunilla (born 1944) and Claes-Göran (born 1948). From his retirement until his death, he resided in Båstad. He was very active in community life and often contributed with lectures on various social issues and his experiences from his many international assignments. Until the age of 95, he was, among other things, a leader of the senior citizen gymnastics in Båstad.\n\n\n== Death ==\nStåhl died on 11 April 2016 in Båstad, Skåne County, Sweden.

        "content": "Suberinic acids are a type of carboxylic acids naturally encountered in the bark of Betula tree species. Chemically, they predominantly have long (C18) chains with α- and ω- bifunctional saturated and unsaturated fatty acid ends. Their name originates from suberin, a major chemical biopolymer of tree bark.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe outer bark of birch (Betula spp.) tree is abundant in betulin. Upon extracting betulin, the remaining material consists of tissues containing suberin. Suberin is a biopolyester composed of α,ω - bifunctional fatty acids, namely the suberinic acids, which, along with lignocarbohydrate complexes, can serve as a potential adhesive in the form of a byproduct obtained during the extraction of suberinic acids for polyol synthesis. Recent studies have proved the potential application of this product, obtained by depolymerizing suberin, in the wood-based panels such as particleboard utilizing different solvents.\nRecently, suberinic acids have found to have new applications in wood industry. The industrial mixture of suberinic acids, obtained from extracted birch outer bark, can be successfully used in industry for adhesion purposes, possibly in wood protection as well.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Le viste la cara a Dios (English: You Saw the Face of God) is a short story about human trafficking by Argentine writer Gabriela Cabezón Cámara, first published in 2011. It was the first ebook in Spanish to be chosen as book of the year by Revista Ñ, an arts and culture magazine published by Argentine newspaper Clarín. It also ranked third on the 2011 book-of-the-year list by Buenos Aires bookshop Eterna Cadencia.\nThe plot tells the story of Beya, a young woman who is kidnapped by a prostitution ring and who is looking for a way to escape the constant torture and rape of which she is a victim. It makes several references to the case of Marita Verón, a 23-year-old Argentine girl who was kidnapped in 2002 by a trafficking network. It is dedicated to the desire for Marita to be found alive, along with todas las nenas, adolescentes y mujeres esclavas de las redes de prostitución.\nIn 2013, a version of the story was published in graphic novel format with the title Beya (Le viste la cara a Dios), featuring illustrations by Iñaki Echeverría. Both the original version and the graphic novel had a positive critical reception and received institutional recognition, such as from the Argentine Senate, for their impact on society.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe protagonist of the story, whose real name is unknown, is a young girl who studies, works, and performs community service in a children's hospital on the outskirts of the city. One day she is kidnapped by a human trafficking network and forcibly taken to a brothel located in Lanús, where she is subjected to constant abuse by the pimp known as El Rata and his henchmen, who beat her and drug her with cocaine to prevent her from falling asleep during the fifteen hours a day in which they prostitute her. She is soon nicknamed Beya. This sounds phonetically similar to Bella, which is Spanish for \"beautiful\". According to Lastero, the deliberate substitution of the /ll/ sound for the /y/ sound is meant to evoke the exaggerated pronunciation of the /y/ by people from the Río de la Plata region of Argentina. \nIn order to cope with her situation, the protagonist learns to disassociate her mind from her body while she is being raped and to imagine that she is floating upwards to take refuge with God.\nSome time later, Beya decides to pretend to have fallen in love with El Rata, and to also show a more submissive attitude towards him. This leads him to have more considerations towards her, which includes reducing the number of hours per day in which she is prostituted. Eventually she gains El Rata's trust but continues to pray to cope with her situation. One of her clients hears her prayers and introduces himself to her as Lieutenant López of the Buenos Aires police. He gives her a St. George medal and promises to take care of her.\nOne day, one of the other women who had been kidnapped attempts to ask for help in order to escape, so El Rata savagely beats her almost to death and asks Beya to give her the coup de grâce. She obeys and this officially makes her a part of her captor's gang, since he had given her that test as a rite of passage. After talking to El Rata, she manages to convince him to move her to the S&M area of the brothel. By taking on the role of dominatrix, this allows her to unleash some of her anger about all that has happened to her. Beya regains her strength and one day finds a submachine gun that Lieutenant López had left in her room. She hides the gun in her panties and goes to El Rata. Then, she unloads a volley of bullets and kills him and everyone present. Beya leaves the brothel and meets in the Church of St George with Lieutenant López, who gets her a false passport with which she can finally escape to Madrid.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe author started writing the story after having received an invitation in 2010 from digital publishing house SigueLeyendo.es, owned by writer Cristina Fallarás, to take part in a project that sought to create new versions of classic fairy tales for adult audiences. Cabezón Cámara was asked to take Sleeping Beauty as a starting point, which inspired her to write the story with a protagonist in a situation of sexual slavery. This protagonist is nicknamed Beya durmiente because she tries to sleep in an attempt to disassociate from the rapes she is subjected to and thus escape from the pain. The story was released for sale in 2011 in digital format.\nStructurally, the story is divided into three chapters and makes repeated use of octosyllabic verse. It is also almost entirely written in the second person. According to the author, she made this stylistic choice because she did not think she would have been able to convey in the first person the intensity of the pain suffered by a trafficked woman, while an extradiegetic narrator posed the difficulty of not being able to determine to whom the voice might belong. She ultimately chose the second person in order to portray the disassociation of the protagonist, who takes refuge in an inner space away from her kidnappers and from what her body is feeling.\nThe story contains numerous references to works such as the Bible, El Gaucho Martín Fierro, and Kill Bill, among others. The title of the story is in turn a reference to the Argentine expression verle la cara a Dios, used in relation to the pleasure of the first sexual experience of young boys, which used to take place in brothels where they were taken by their father or another relative as a rite of passage.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nLe viste la cara a Dios depicts the drama of prostitution and sex slavery rings. To explore the horror of this reality, Cabezón Cámara uses terms and phrases related to the meat industry and the slaughter of cattle for human consumption as a metaphor for the degradation and objectification suffered by the protagonist. Some of the descriptions that stand out include: the characterization of the brothel as a matadero infecto and the threat that at the slightest provocation te pasan a degüello como un chancho y te filetean como jamón cuando quieran. The graphic novel version is more explicit with these comparisons and shows an image of Beya in which arrows point to various parts of her body to label them like cuts of meat. Another example is the depiction of The Last Supper, in which Beya takes the place of Jesus and is the one who feeds her flesh to the group of men who surround her.\nThe idea of using the meat trade as a metaphor for forced prostitution, in which women become human cattle for consumption, has a long-standing tradition in Argentine literature. Among the works referenced by the author is El matadero (in English, The Slaughter Yard) from 1837, a short story by Esteban Echeverría, considered by critics to be one of the foundational works of Argentine literature. It tells the story of a rape.\nThe story uses explicit language to narrate the abuse suffered by Beya as a way of highlighting the atmosphere of violence and the process of destruction this abuse puts her through, which can be seen in the following excerpt:\n\nLa cuestión es que te garchan el Cuervo Rata y amigos, más el juez, los policías, el cerdo gobernador y muchos clientes civiles van pasando de a uno en fondo. A veces te la dan de a dos, pero por suerte ya no la patota entera, el límite lo puso el Rata que creyó en tu amor. Uno te acaba en la boca y el otro te rompe el orto…te fornican y te aplastan para que no te quede más ninguna interioridad.\nCabezón Cámara also describes how the act of rape is used by the aggressors to establish dominance over the body, which in their eyes becomes a territory over which they have governance rights and which they can freely share with others. The story stresses precisely the attempt by El Rata and his henchmen to \"tame\" Beya through beatings and rape, in a process that includes taking away her speech and her identity and annihilating her subjectivity as a way of dehumanizing her.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWhen the story—as well as its graphic novel adaptation—was published, this had quite an impact on Argentina. Among the distinctions it received was the Alfredo Palacios award, granted by the Argentine Senate in recognition of its contribution to the fight against human trafficking networks. It was also declared as a work of public interest by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and nominated for the Reader's Prize at the Buenos Aires International Book Fair.\nThe work was well received by critics. Revista Ñ included it in its list of the ten best literary works of 2011. Laura Cardona, in an article for newspaper La Nación, referred to the story as un texto riquísimo y necesario in which todo resulta impactante. Some of the aspects she drew attention to include the references to other works, the way in which Beya's degradation was narrated, and the use of the second person to express the disassociation of the protagonist, to which Cardona referred as una apuesta audaz y logradísima de la autora. On its part, the review by Página 12 referred to the story as un relato hipnótico a partir de una cadencia rítmica que se repite y que con el correr de las páginas gana la fuerza de un texto religioso.\nSeveral reviews stressed how the nature of the work establishes itself against human trafficking and violence against women in general. The review by Clarín referred to this aspect and claimed that the story proposed una denuncia sobre la condición de la mujer en círculos machistas y maltratadores while magazine Cosecha Roja referred to it as un grito desesperado written for those who sostienen que esos crímenes sigan, desde el cliente hasta el politico. Similar opinions were shared by Argentine politician Laura Vilches who, in an article for La Izquierda Diario in which she analyzed the work, criticized the various forms of violence that women like Beya are subjected to every day and called for the dismantling of trafficking networks.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe work was adapted to graphic novel format and published in 2013 with the title Beya (Le viste la cara a Dios) by publishing house Eterna Cadencia. It was illustrated by artist Iñaki Echeverría, whom Cabezón Cámara had met in a group of artists with whom she had discussed the possibility of writing a graphic crime novel. For the illustration process, Echeverría decided to use black and white drawings. He included elements of Christian iconography as well as representations of famous works of art, such as Michelangelo's Pietà, Gustav Klimt's The Kiss, or Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. This version is split into five chapters.\nMoreover, the story has been adapted twice for the theater. The first time was in 2016 by actress Marisa Busker, while the second one was in 2019 by actress and director Victoria Roland with the title Beya Durmiente, with the performance of Carla Crespo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDisappearance of Marita Verón\nHuman trafficking in Argentina\nGabriela Cabezón Cámara\nRomance de la negra rubia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGabriela Cabezón Cámara: Beya (Le viste la cara a dios) on YouTube (An interview with the author about her work) (in Spanish)\nGraná, Leonardo Emanuel (2019). \"Le viste la cara a Dios\", de Gabriela Cabezón Cámara, con y contra el canon.

        "content": "Nothing's Impossible is a 2010 studio album by American soul musician Solomon Burke, his last recording of original material prior to his death. The recording received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing that \"it's all but impossible to make a bad record with Solomon Burke\" and that \"one listen to Nothing's Impossible confirms that [producer Willie] Mitchell's instincts were right on the money\" to make \"rich, strong, and gospel-influenced R&B that's sturdy enough to support Burke's earth-shaking vocals while giving the star of the show enough room to move comfortably\" and that results in \"R&B that's smart, passionate, and powerful, and proves the King of Rock and Soul still rules his kingdom with a sure hand\". Darryl Easlea of BBC Music summed up his review that \"for his final work, Willie Mitchell found a perfect partner, and Nothing’s Impossible sees him depart on a high\". A piece in Billboard by Ilya Skripnikov characterized this release, \"with themes of love, loneliness and longing, Burke’s raw emotional delivery and Mitchell’s rich arrangements ensure that the music penetrates to the heart and soul\". Steve Slagg of PopMatters rated Nothing's Impossible a 6 out of 10, stating that it is \"powerful stuff\" that is \"a tribute to two great musical talents, still playing at the top of their game after so many years\" but \"it’s nowhere near as vital as either the early works it’s drawing on or the late-career exploration it’s following\". Rolling Stone's Will Hermes rated this album 3 out of 5 stars, stating that Burke \"has been on a revival roll since 2002's Don't Give Up On Me\" and that \"Mitchell's arrangements recall his best work with Al Green\". Writing for Slant Magazine, Johnathan Keefe rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the musicianship but criticizing some tracks as weaker, stating that \"it’s impressive, if not exactly surprising, that he elevates some middling songs through sheer conviction and the awesome power of his voice\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Oh What a Feeling\" (Julius Bradley, Spencer Randolph, and Willie Mitchell) – 3:55\n\"Everything About You\" (Solomon Burke) – 3:38\n\"Dreams\" (Burke and Mitchell) – 6:15\n\"Nothing's Impossible\" (Jason Hohenberg and Mitchell) – 3:18\n\"It Must Be Love\" (Hohenberg and Mitchell) – 5:02\n\"You Needed Me\" (Randy Goodrum) – 3:46\n\"Say You Love Me Too\" (Mitchell) – 3:23\n\"You're Not Alone\" (S.

        "content": "Carla Maria Gomes Barros (born 1980) is a Portuguese politician and a human resources manager. She is a deputy in the 16th legislature of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal, as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), having previously also served in the 11th, 13th, and 14th legislatures. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBarros was born on 8 February 1980. She lives in Póvoa de Varzim in the Porto District. She has a degree in human resources management, specialising in public administration, and post-graduate training in public administration, with a specialisation in gender equality.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBarros has worked as a programme coordinator in the public sector with the Northern Regional Coordination and Development Commission (CCDR-NORTE), which is a public institution aiming at the integrated and sustainable development of the north of Portugal. She has also been director of the Matosinhos Employment Centre.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nShe was first elected to the parliament in 2009, serving in the 11th legislature. She was not elected to the 12th legislature but returned to the National Assembly in 2015 as a deputy in the 13th legislature and was re-elected in 2019, serving until 2022. In that year she was not re-elected, following a dominant victory by the Socialist Party. For the 2024 national election the PSD formed an alliance with two smaller parties, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD) and Barros was 15th on the AD's list for the Porto constituency, with the AD winning sufficient votes for 14 seats. However, following the decision of the director of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Porto, Óscar Afonso, who had been fourth on the list, not to take his place in the parliament, Barros was promoted. Newspapers had suggested that Afonso had been hoping to be made minister of finance and resigned once that position was given to someone else.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gaul Indonesian or Colloquial Indonesian is the informal register of the Indonesian language that emerged in the 1980s and continues to evolve to this day. According to the Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language (KBBI), colloquial language is defined as 'a non-formal dialect of Indonesian used by certain communities for socialization'. The vocabulary of this language comes from various sources, such as the Jakarta Indonesian dialect, prokem language, regional languages, and foreign languages. In addition, colloquial language also creates new vocabulary formed through certain rules. The basis of this Colloquial Indonesian is the Betawi language. Initially, this language was used in the Jakarta area, but over time, it spread throughout Indonesia through mass media, especially television and the internet. Colloquial language replaced the use of prokem language which was previously popular in the 1970s. In addition to maintaining the influence of a number of vocabulary from prokem language, the Colloquial Indonesian also receives influences from Binan language and regional languages in Indonesia.\nIndonesian language currently also has significant influence on many regional languages in Indonesia. Almost every region in Indonesia has its own distinctive colloquial Indonesian variation.\nThis language is formed through the process of mixing Indonesian language with regional languages, which then produces a new language used in everyday conversation. This process also facilitates the absorption of terms from regional languages into Indonesian language.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndonesian slang\nBetawi language\n\n\n== References ==",

Both stages burned a polyurethane composite and had a diameter of 28 cm. Total weight of Tauro was 1200 kg with a length of 7.6 m.\nThe first Tauro (Tauro T-01) was launched in July 1977 from CELPA, Chamical. A second rocket (Tauro T-02) was launched on February 2, 1979.\nThe last flight (Tauro T-09) happened on December 10, 1981, equipped with cameras for earth surface photography from high altitudes. The photographic payload was successfully recovered.\n\n\n== References ==",

It provides financial support to attract producers to use Queensland as a filming location or for other related services, e.g. post-production. It supports skills development of Queenslanders in the indusry and the holding of film festivals and other events. It seeks to increase the involvement of Indigenous Australians in the industry. It often partners with Screen Australia which has similar objectives for Australia.\nWhile Screen Queensland has used it funding to attract major international productions, such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, to be filmed in Queensland, the local industry believe that the funding would be better used to support local productions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nScreen Queensland Studios\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Masquerade: The Baubles of Doom is an action-adventure beat 'em up video game both developed and published by Big Ant Studios. The game was released on April 19, 2016, in North America, on April 20, 2016, in Europe and Australia for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, and worldwide for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and on April 21, 2016, for Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn Masquerade: The Baubles of Doom, players control Jaxx (and Comedia with multiplayer), a jester on a quest to retrieve stolen Baubles of Doom from an evil sorcerer. The game features exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat mechanics across various levels.\nA central gameplay element involves the ability to switch between different masks, each granting Jaxx unique abilities. These masks include a knight mask for combat, a ninja mask for stealth, and a wizard mask for puzzle-solving.\nPlayers navigate through levels by performing 'acrobatic moves and combat combos.' Hidden collectibles and secrets are scattered throughout levels, encouraging exploration and replayability.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nMasquerade: The Baubles of Doom received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nKieran Harris for Push Square rated the game 5 out of 10 stars, stating that \"Although it may be undeniably pretty, Masquerade: The Baubles of Doom suffers from a number of glaring flaws that prevent it from being a worthwhile experience.\"\nCD-Action rated the game 6/10 in their magazine, stating that \"Masquerade is a bit like Leslie Nielsen’s comedy movies – silly and childish, but it’s hard to hold back laughter. It’s a pity that the gameplay can’t keep up with the humor, exposing the developers’ tight budget and lack of experience.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nMortal Kombat, a video game franchise known for making action-adventure beat 'em up video games.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMasquerade: The Baubles of Doom at MobyGames",

        "content": "Ramuri (\"Twigs\") is a Romanian literary magazine.\nThe magazine was published at Craiova from 5 December 1905 until May 1947, with interruptions, changes in publication location and frequency. At first, it appeared monthly, then in 1908–1910, 1912–1914, 1919–1921, 1923–1924 bimonthly, weekly in October 1910–May 1911, 1915–1916, and 1922, and only once in 1945. It was not published in 1918, 1930–1933, and 1946. In 1913, it was subtitled \"Illustrated literary magazine\", and from 24 January 1915 to 15 July 1917 it merged with Nicolae Iorga's Drum Drept. It was printed at Bucharest in 1916 and at Iași in 1917; from January 1922 to April 1927, the title Drum Drept became a subtitle. Constantin Șaban Făgețel and D. Tomescu once described themselves the \"only two\" founders, though N. Bănescu is generally mentioned as their partner. Iorga himself was involved later on, serving as Ramuri director from 1923 to 1927. It was led over the years by a committee, the composition of which appeared in a square on the front cover until 1923. In its first years, the committee was composed of N. Bănescu, Șt. Braborescu, D. N. Ciotori, C. Ș. Făgețel, G. C. Ionescu-Șișești, and N. Vulovici. Other editors included Elena Farago, Emil Gârleanu, I. M. Marinescu, C. D. Fortunescu, and Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor.\nFrom its early years, the magazine adopted a stance modeled on the traditionalist ideology promoted by Sămănătorul of Bucharest; the staff of the two publications, together called a Sămănătorist current, were close. \"Credințele și gândul nostru\" (\"Our Beliefs and Thought\"), the magazine's manifesto signed by Tomescu, eulogized the literary course charted by Iorga, considered a veritable \"emperor of thought\", while Sămănătorul represented \"the most proper and healthy direction\" in Romanian literary life. Ramuri considered itself \"a timid green shoot, sprouted from the vigorous trunk of a literary current that had conquered the entire Romanian soul\", as Făgețel wrote. Other articles setting forth a vision include \"Rostul și atitudinea noastră\" (\"Our Purpose and Attitude\"; 1908, Tomescu) and \"După șase ani de luptă. Literatura în 1911\" (\"After Six Years of Struggle. Literature in 1911”; 1911, Făgețel). According to philologist Gabriel Coșoveanu, Ramuri also had a regionalist ethos, as an \"emblem of the Oltenian spirit\".\nThe magazine included a literary and an arts column, sections of poetry, prose, translations, commentaries (\"Notes\"), folklore, articles on aesthetics, art theory, philosophy, psychology, morals, history, geography, ethnography, as well as letters, memories, commemorations and obituaries. Among the artists who illustrated the pages were Francisc Șirato, Mircea Olarian, Costin Oper, Nadia Bulighin, I. Nițescu, Sever Burada, O. Rădulescu, and G. Billek. Poetry held an important place in Ramuri; contributors included Octavian Goga (\"Revedere\", \"A fost odată\"), George Topîrceanu, Ion Minulescu, Ștefan Octavian Iosif, Nicolae Davidescu, Farago, Eugen Constant, Marcel Romanescu, Vulovici, Al. Iacobescu, Al. C. Calotescu-Neicu, N. Milcu, Ștefan Bălcești, I. C. Popescu-Polyclet, Victor Eftimiu, Ecaterina Pitiș, I. M. Marinescu, Maria Nicolau, G. Tutoveanu, and Dem. Bassarabescu. Among the contributors after 1920 were Lucian Blaga (\"Lume\"), Tudor Arghezi (\"Oraș medieval\"), Ion Pillat (\"Elegie\", \"Recuerdo\", \"Cules\"), Vasile Voiculescu (\"Avariție\", \"Înaintea aurorei\", \"Apocalips\"), and Zaharia Stancu.\nProse writers included Ioan Slavici (\"Amurg de viață\", \"Fragmente din jurnalul intim în formă epistolară\"), Dimitrie Anghel (\"Pelerinul pasionat\", \"Povestea celor necăjiți\", \"Tinereță\"), Mihail Sadoveanu (\"Biserica Jitarului\"), Liviu Rebreanu (\"Ordonanța domnului colonel\", \"Mărturisire\"), Gib Mihăescu (\"Scuarul\") and Victor Papilian (\"P. N. V.\", \"Popa ăl bătrân\"). Ion Agârbiceanu was present almost from the beginning, with a large number of sketches and short stories (\"Adormirea lui Moș Ioniță\", \"Râvna părintelui Man\", \"Lumea bătrânilor\", \"Legământul diavolului\", \"Baba Ilina se pregătește de drum\", \"Se-mpacă doi dușmani\", \"Pocăința neamului\"). Other prose writers with Sămănătorist affinities included Emil Gârleanu (\"Călătorie\", \"O lacrimă pe o geană\"), Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești (\"Părtașul\"), Cezar Petrescu (\"Învierea căpitanului Lazăr\", \"Omul din vis\"), Caton Theodorian (\"De închiriat\", \"În paraclisul iubirii\"), Alexandru Lascarov-Moldovanu (\"O vizită\"), Ion Ciocârlan, Eugen Boureanul, Petre Partenie, Tiberiu Crudu, and Ion Dragu. The theater was represented by Eftimiu (Rapsozii), Iorga (Tudor Vladimirescu, Sarmală, amicul poporului), G. M. Vlădescu (Omul care nu mai vine), and Blaga (a fragment of Zamolxe). Travel literature was contributed by Iorga, Ionescu-Șișești (notes from Germany), Virgil Tempeanu (\"Note de drum\"), and C. D. Ionescu (\"Prin Munții Mehedinților\". Numerous translations appeared of works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Dante Alighieri, Giovanni Boccaccio, Giacomo Leopardi, Rabindranath Tagore, Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Ivan Krylov, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Anton Chekhov, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Valéry, and the verses of Charles Baudelaire, rendered by Ion Pillat and Al. T. Stamatiad. Meanwhile, Farago translated Émile Verhaeren, while D. Nanu, Leconte de Lisle. Other translators included Al. Iacobescu, I. M. Marinescu, Iorga, and M. D. Ioanid.\nFolklore played an important part; its collectors included Constantin Rădulescu-Codin, D. Lungulescu and Traian Păunescu-Ulmu. Scholarly studies on the subject were signed by Alexandru Dima, Scarlat Struțeanu, Ovidiu Papadima, Dumitru Caracostea, and Al. Popescu-Telega. Literary commentary was offered by Iorga, Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, Caracostea, Tudor Vianu, Tomescu, Făgețel, Dima, and Păunescu-Ulmu. Most articles in this area promoted traditionalist literature; modern forms were often met with visible reservations (Petre Drăgescu, \"Extremismul literar\"; Păunescu-Ulmu, \"Tradiție și literatură\"). Indeed, the magazine engaged in polemics with Eugen Lovinescu, Mihail Dragomirescu, Ovid Densusianu and certain modernist magazines (e.g., \"Intelectualizarea\", \"Impertinență sau aiurea\", by Tomescu), on the subject of promoting national characteristics in literature. Vianu wrote \"Universul moral al lui Macedonski\" and \"Gustul literar\", Struțeanu surveyed the work of Mihai Eminescu, Petre Partenie commented on Vasile Alecsandri. Iorga was particularly active, discussing numerous questions of literary history and aspects of daily life in the past. He signed an article about the towns of Oltenia during the modernization phase of 1760–1830, with similar interests being expressed by Bănescu, Furtună, Lazăr Toma, Fortunescu, Sextil Pușcariu, Ioan Lupaș, M. Strajaru, and Constantin Cehan-Racoviță. Contributors were also interested in documents and archives, unearthing important new information about writers such as Grigore Alexandrescu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Iosif Vulcan, Costache Caragiale, Ioan Maiorescu, and Traian Demetrescu. The magazine also included a review of magazines, as well as notes and commentaries on morals, religion, psychology, education, history, geography and ethnology, bringing an essential contribution to shaping the cultural landscape of its day. Other authors included Emanoil Bucuța, Zaharia Bârsan, Aron Cotruș, Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, Nicolae M. Condiescu, N. I. Herescu, Ion Dongorozi, Anastasie Mândru, Mihai Moșandrei, Gavril Rotică, I. U. Soricu, George Vâlsan, George Voevidca, I. Pavelescu, G. D. Pencioiu, and Liviu Marian.\nThe magazine was revived as a monthly publication appearing at Craiova from August 1964—the date was selected to coincide with the 20th Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day—marked as a national holiday in the Romanian People's Republic. The issue featured an account by Tudor Arghezi, describing his feelings about the Oltenian town of Târgu Cărbunești, as well as lyrics by Marin Sorescu and Nicolae Dragoș, and the summary of a round-table on the life and times of Constantin Brâncuși (with participants such as André Frénaud). Ilie Purcaru was this edition's first publisher; the editorial offices were in the same building as the local daily, Înainte. Purcaru was succeeded by Alexandru Piru, himself replaced by Sorescu. This incarnation considers itself a successor of Făgețel's enterprise, celebrating 2005 as its centennial. The new edition's first 25 years of existence coincided with the second half of Romania's existence as a communist state. In 1965–1966, Miron Radu Paraschivescu, a dissident poet engaged with the anti-Stalinist left, was charged with answering letters to the editor. As one who reviewed aspiring authors, he was eventually allowed in April 1966 to publish Ramuri's literary supplement, Povestea Vorbei (\"The Story of the Word\"), which he turned from a provincial-level publication into a nationally-famous institution for debuting young writers. \nParaschivescu only preserved his position until December 1966, when communist censors intervened \"for ideological reasons\". By then, however, he had personally handled the publication of poems by the erstwhile prohibited Onirists, including Leonid Dimov and Vintilă Ivănceanu, but also the first poems by a post-Onirist generation of poets—Ștefan Agopian and Virgil Mazilescu. Other Paraschivescu discoveries were Norman Manea, whose first experimental short-story was taken by Povestea Vorbei in 1966, and the literary historian Florea Firan, who in 1995 published a Ramuri-themed monograph. At the beginning of the post-Paraschivescu decade, in February 1967, Ramuri was the center of a cultural circle involving Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor and Petre Pandrea; their activities focused on recovering contributions by other old-regime figures, including Brâncuși and novelist Gib Mihăescu.\nAccording to a contemporary note by poet Nicolae Prelipceanu, Sorescu's arrival as manager in September 1978 was a qualitative boost for Ramuri—introducing the public to new talents, such as Dorin Tudoran and Ion Cocora. During Sorescu's period as editor, the magazine employed a known dissident, and former political prisoner, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu. Such associations made the magazine a target of constant surveillance by the Securitate, who relied on a growing network of Craiova informants. Building on documents provided by historian Clara Mareș in 2012, literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu opined that the network must have included Sorescu himself, who \"managed to both inform on Sîrbu and protect him, being, as it turns out, himself the target of surveillance\"; according to Mihăilescu, collaboration with the Securitate had by then become virtually obligatory for people involved in editorial work. In the late 1970s, Ramuri still hosted criticism of the national-communist venues, engaging itself in polemics with writers Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The latter two had declared Sorescu's novel, La lilieci, to have been attack on \"national specificity\"; in his reply, carried by Ramuri of December 1978, Sorescu ridiculed Barbu, signaling a push-back against the national-communist supremacy in arts and letters. \nA while after, in the early 1980s, Ramuri also had a sports page. It was largely dedicated to the coverage of Romanian football, with contributions by Ilie Balaci and by Sorescu himself; both covered the exceptionally productive seasons of Universitatea Craiova. Sorescu preserved his position after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, but in March 1991 came into conflict with his colleagues, who voted to have him sacked; in their justification, they alleged that Sorescu had been \"dictatorial\" in his behavior, and that he had been disrespectful of other writers (among them Ana Blandiana, Eugène Ionesco, and Nicolae Manolescu); Sorescu responded in Adevărul daily, suggesting that the Ramuri staff resented his a-political line (including his refusal to publish current-affairs commentary), but agreeing to hand in his resignation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Los Darts was a 1960s rock music band from Venezuela who recorded for various labels. They had several hits in their country during the 1960s. They are a part of the history of Venezuelan rock music.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAlong with Los Supersónicos, Los Impala and Los 007, Los Darts are regarded as one of the most important rock groups in Venezuela during the 1960s.\nTheir chart hits include Los Mejo Que Vio En Ti in 1967, \"Por Alguien Como Tú\" in 1970.\n\nThe group was formed in the mid-1960s. The group was made up of Carlos Moreán on rhythm guitar and backing vocals, Richard Aumaitre on bass and backing vocals, Rafael \"Parajito\" Pimental on drums, Augusto de Lima on lead guitar, Claudio Gámez on keyboards, and Victor Gámez on lead vocals.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1960s to 1970s ===\nIn 1966, the group released their self titled debut album. Also that year, the group released their EP, Tu La Vas A Perder on Songs EPS 02. The songs on the EP were, \"Tu La Vas A Perder\", which was a cover of the Beatles \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\", \"Por Tu Amor\", \"Donde, Donde\" and \"Gritos\".\nIn August 1967, their single, \"Los Mejo Que Vio En Ti\" was in the Venezuela Top Ten.\nThe June 20, 1970, issue of Record World reported that their single \"Por Alguien Como Tú\" was threatening to become a break out single. It was also at no. 15 in the Latin American Hit Parade top 15. The August 15 issue of Record World now had it at no. 4.\nIn 1971, the group released the single, \"Jesucristo\" bw \"Ahora Soy Feliz\" on Top Hits H-3040 in Venezuela, and on Odeon SOM 145 in Mexico. It was credited to Victor Gamez con los Darts.\n\n\n== Post Los Darts ==\nFollowing the break up of the group, Victor Gámez had a career as a solo singer and in October 1971, his single \"Yod Soy\" was in the Venezuela Top Ten.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn 1996, their album Grandes Exitos De Los Darts was released.

        "content": "Patricia \"Patti\" Garamendi (born April 11, 1944) is an American attorney, rancher and politician from California and a member of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPatricia Alice Wilkinson was born on April 11, 1944, in Watsonville, Santa Cruz Country, California.  She attended UC Berkley and holds a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and a J.D. from UC Berkeley's Humphrey's Law School. She met her future husband John at Berkeley. They married in 1965 and served together in the Peace Corps from 1966 to 1968, stationed in Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\nIn 1990 John Garamendi won the Democratic primary for the newly created office of State Insurance Commissioner. He was so confident of victory against a weak Republican opponent that he resigned his state senate seat early, allowing Patti to get a jump on her top rival, assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton). Despite pouring more than $700,000 into the race (much if it from her own pocket) she lost to Johnston by 9 percentage points.\nIn 1991 she ran for Johnston's vacant seat in the California State Assembly. Although initially considered a favorite, Patti was upset by Republican Dean Andal, a former aide to Rep. Norm Shumway (R-Roseville) by more than 14 points.\nIn 1992 she ran once again, this time for the newly drawn Stockton area 11th congressional district. It contained some of the same territory in both the state assembly and state senate seats she had previously run for. She easily won the Democratic primary but went on to narrowly lose the general election to Republican Richard Pombo by 2 percentage points.\n\n\n== State and federal posts ==\nIn 1993 she became associate director of the Peace Corps. In 1998, she was appointed deputy administrator of the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, where she ran an international food cooperation program.\nReturning to California, she served as deputy secretary of the Technology, Trade and Commerce agency under Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. In 2005, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed her deputy secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing agency.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOn March 25, 2024, she was named Sacramento County Woman of the Year by state senator Bill Dodd.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJoin California",

The consecration of the place took place three years later. The chapels, however, date back to 1657 and are dedicated to Saint Maurus and Saint Monas, bishop of Milan in the 3rd century; the altar dates back to 1679 and there is a painting of the Nativity from the same period, probably by Zanetto Bugatto. The choir dates back to 1692, while the pipe organ, built by Giovanni Rondini and rebuilt by the Serassi Brothers in 1832, is the oldest in the city.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Devardhi or Vachanacharya Devardhigani Kshamashramana or Devavachaka was a Jain ascetic of the Śvetāmbara sect and an author of several Prakrit texts.\nHe was a prominent figure in Jainism in the 5th century AD. Mainly known for his contributions to the compilation and preservation of the canonical Jain scriptures, he is one of the most revered ascetics of the Śvetāmbara sect of Jainism. It was under his guidance that the second council of Vallabhi was held to preserve the remaining canonical texts of Jainism. Apart from the compilation of the canonical texts, he has been revered for his spiritual teachings as well.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDevardhigani was born in the Kshatriya caste of the Kashyap gotra (family lineage). According to a legend, Mahavira had told Saudharmendra (demi-god in Jainism) in a holy assembly in Rajgruhi city,\"Harinaigmeshin transferred me during my state of embryo from the womb of Devananda to the womb of Trishala and after 1000 years of my nirvana (emencipation), he would live again by the name of Devardhigani and he would be the final authority on the Drishtivaad (the title of twelfth anga).\"His mother, Kalavati, named him Devardhi after a divine vision she had during her pregnancy.\n\n\n== Initiation ==\nAccording to a legend, in his youth, he was interested in hunting. He had a life-threatening encounter with a lion which led to a spiritual awakening. Terrified and helpless, he vowed to devote himself to spiritual pursuits if saved. Following this incident, he sought guidance from Acharya Lohityasuri and embraced monkhood in the Śvetāmbara sect of Jainism.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nHis most notable contributions revolve around the preservation and compilation of Jain scriptures, especially at the second council of Vallabhi held in 453 AD.\n\nDuring a period of crisis caused by a 12-year long famine and gradual loss of knowledge among ascetics, he led efforts to preserve scriptural knowledge and systematically compile texts. Under his leadership, the Jain community united to safeguard the integrity of their scriptures, preventing division and ensuring the continuity of Jain teachings.\nAt the beginning of the Vallabhi Council, Devardhigani sat with shramans (Jain monks) and listened to the canonical texts and memorized them all and scripted them systematically and in an organized fashion. As a result of the first council of Vallabhi and the Mathura council, there were two different set of texts, \"Skandili\" and \"Nagarjuniya\". Acharya Kalak-IV was representing the \"Nagarjuniya text\", whereas Devardhigani was representing the \"Skandili text\". Both these sets of canonical texts had variations because Acharya Skandilsuri (author of Skandili text) and Acharya Nagarjunsuri (author of Nagarjuniya text) had never met before or during the compilation and writing. Both the texts were written simultaneously as the first council of Vallabhi and the Mathura council were held simultaneously during the same period. Variations in the two texts had almost led to an imminent division of the Jain sangha itself. Devardhigani was noble enough to note the variations between both the texts. Acharya Kalak also co-operated with him. The urgency about the loss of canonical texts was recognized by him and a simultaneous writing of canonical texts was successfully accomplished under his leadership.\nHowever, the texts compiled under his guidance were completely rejected by the Digambara sect. These texts were, however, accepted partially by monks and followers of the Yapaniya sect.\nThe canonical texts written and edited under his leadership at Vallabhi have been accepted as the oldest works of Jain literature, with the Acharanga Sutra being accepted as the oldest among others such as Sutrakritanga Sutra and the Uttaradhyayana Sutra.\nHe also composed the scripture Nandisutra which lists a Pattavali.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nOne of the texts that mention him is the Pattavali, in the second section of the Kalpa Sūtra, which is both an account and a praise of all the early Śvetāmbara Jain acharyas. The penultimate verse pays homage to them in the first person, and the last verse celebrates Devardhigani. It is as follows: -\n\nsutt’-attha-rayaṇa-bharie\nkhama-dama-maddava-guṇehi sampanne\nDeviḍḍhi-khamāsamaṇe\nKāsava-gotte paṇivayāmi\n\n- Kalpa Sūtra Sthavirāvalī, final verse\n\nThe above text, translated into English: -\n\nI revere the Kṣamāśramaṇa Devarddhi of the Kāśyapa gotra, who wears, as it were, the jewel of the right understanding of the Sūtras, and possesses the virtue of patience, self-restraint, and clemency \n\n- Kalpa Sūtra Sthavirāvalī, final verse\n(Translated by Hermann Jacobi in 1884)\n\nDevardhigani's legacy extends beyond his scholarly achievements and is visible in the aagams (canonical texts) edited and written under his guidance. His dedication to preserving Jain scriptures and fostering unity within the community laid the groundwork for future generations of scholars and practitioners as the canonical texts form the basis of major Jain texts such as the Trishashti-Shalakapurusha-Charitra. His spiritual teachings continue to inspire Jain followers worldwide. With his death in 473 AD, the tradition ofz passing of scriptural knowledge orally came to an end as all canonical texts had been written.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJain, Prof. Sagarmal. \"Contributions of Jain Acharyas to Jainism.\" Bharatiya Jnanpith.\nVijaya Ratnaprabh. \"Sthaviravali.\"\nShah, Sudhir M. \"Understanding of Jain Way of Life Exhibition.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stevens Institute of Technology is a private research university in Hoboken, New Jersey. Founded in 1870, it is one of the oldest technological universities in the United States and was the first college in America solely dedicated to mechanical engineering. The university is led by a president, who is selected by the board of trustees by ballot. The president is an ex officio member of the board and presides at its meetings. One of five officers of the university's legal corporation, the Trustees of Stevens Institute of Technology, the president also acts as the chief executive officer. The president is tasked with \"general charge and supervision over and responsibility for the affairs of the University and the direction of the University’s faculty\". If the office is vacant the board shall then elect a new president, in the interim the chair may appoint an acting president.The institution's first president was Henry Morton in 1870, and its 7th and current president is Nariman Farvardin, who was elected in 2011. All of Stevens' presidents have been male, two have been immigrants, and one has been an alumnus of the institution. Morton had the longest serving tenure at 32 years, while Farvardin has had the shortest tenure so far at 13 years. As of 2022, the annual compensation of the president was $1,603,757.Since 1929, the president's official residence has been the Hoxie House, a three-story brick building fronted by a circular driveway and fountain. The residence is named after William Hoxie, a member of the class of 1889 who financed the building. At the laying of the cornerstone for Hoxie House, U.S. President Herbert Hoover sent his congratulations.The president's office is located on the upper floors of the Wesley J. Howe Center, located at 1 Castle Point Terrace in Hoboken, NJ. Previously the site of the Stevens Family home, Castle Point.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n        President of Stevens Institute of Technology •         Acting President of Stevens Institute of Technology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

        "content": "Throughout late March and April 2024, Europe was affected by abnormally high temperatures that reached the summer average. National records for spring temperatures were broken in mainly Eastern European and Southeastern European countries. During March, eight countries had broken temperature records with Moldova reporting the highest 29.7 °C in Sîngerei followed by Albania at 29.6 °C in Kuçovë, Croatia at 29 °C in Osijek, and Belarus at 27.2 °C in Lyelchytsy. The heatwave continued into April with temperatures going above 30 °C in southern parts of Europe making it the first-ever daytime record in April. The highest was recorded in Zenica, Bosnia & Herzegovina, at 33.3 °C on April 14, 2024. After two weeks of persistent heat, a cold spell occurred. The cause of the heatwave was a stream of hot air from Africa.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reported January 2024 as the hottest month with a 1.66 °C above the pre-industrial average making it 0.12 °C warmer than January 2020. For the first time, the global temperature was above 1.5 °C for 12 months, breaching the 1.5 °C limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. Risks of record-breaking temperatures in 2024 were also noted by the Met Office in the UK. The unusual warmth during the winter continued in February with Europe reporting a 2 °C above average for February 2024. A warm spell occurred in late February in which daily maxima reached up to 20 °C in southeastern parts of Europe which was 12 °C above the 1991-2020 average. March 2024 also broke a record with 1.68 C above the pre-industrial average.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2021 Eurasia winter heatwave\n\n\n== References ==",

Clune had previously written about him in his 1938 book Free and Easy Land.The book was one of three short books by Clune issued in 1945, others being Starlight and Forlorn Hope. The Herald said \"Each of the tales is Informative and diverting. All are marred, however, by overdoses of \"slapstick\". With Frank Clune. a name is a \"monniker,\" a face is a \"flzzog,\" and so on. He could easily retain his breezincss without using so much cheap slang in historical stories.\"The Courier Mail said \"Mr. Clune must have quarried very deeply into musty old records to present a record so complete and detailed.\"The Morning Bulletin said \"On the whole, Mr Clune seems ambitiously to have claimed overmuch, in his title for this prevaricator, and to have overlooked the claims thereto of some of our land settlement politicians.\"The Age said \"Clune tells the story of this engaging and somewhat pathetic rascal with -great gusto, and makes a fascinating story of it.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

The tour began in Shanghai at the Mercedes-Benz Arena on October 17, 2019, and spans 79 dates in Asia, Oceania, and Europe. Initially halted by the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, the concert tour resumed in Singapore in December 2022.\nChinese media sources have highlighted the surge in economic activities and the significant boost in tourism experienced by the cities that were visited by the Carnival World Tour.\n\n\n== Economic impact ==\nChou's concerts in Shanghai in October 2023 brought elevated economic effects to the city's tourism sector. According to statistics from Tongcheng Travel, despite the tourism off-season following the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays, the bookings of hotels in Shanghai from October 12 to 15 ranked amongst the top three nationwide, surging approximately 80%. Demand for taxi travel in the Shanghai area increased by more than 70%, while the demand to and from the Shanghai Stadium increased by as much as 300%. Demand for trips to and from large transportation hubs such as airports and train stations in the city increased by 110%.\nThe concerts in Haikou, Hainan also saw a significant tourism boost due to the tour; the concerts attracted 95,100 tourists from outside of the province and brought ¥976 million (US$134 million) in tourism revenue, nearly triple the amount earned during the Dragon Boat Festival and ¥100 million more than during Labour Day. \nThe Carnival World Tour brought ¥3 billion in tourism revenue in Tianjin and ¥2.88 billion in Hohhot. More than 100,000 tourists travelled to Taiyuan to attend the concerts.\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kuai Kuai Co, Ltd. (Kuai Kuai) is a privately held Taiwanese food production company and is also the name of the puffed corn snacks it manufactures. Kuai Kuai products have been on sale since 1969 and the company officially changed its name to \"Kuai Kuai\" in 1974.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 1956 to 1967, Liao Jingang founded a pharmaceutical factory in Taipei, Taiwan, initially named \"Nan Fang Hong Co., Ltd.,\" which later became \"Dongda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\" The company shifted its focus to manufacturing biscuits and snack foods in 1968, launching the \"Kuai Kuai\" series of products aimed at children. Over the years, the company expanded its operations, establishing the Zhongli Factory in 1983. In 1989, Dongda United merged with Kuai Kuai Company, which then focused primarily on biscuits production. In 1993, the company expanded its market to China. In 2013, Liao Jingang passed away, and his son, Liao Minghui, took over as chairman. Internal strife within the family led to leadership changes in 2018 and 2019, with Sandi Group taking over control of the company. In 2021, Jian Jiafeng assumed the role of general manager.\n\n\n== Kuai Kuai Culture ==\n\nKuai Kuai culture is a phenomenon in Taiwan wherein people put Kuai Kuai snacks next to or on top of machines. People who do this believe that, because the name of the snack—\"Kuai Kuai\"—stands for \"obedient\" or \"well-behaved,\" it will make a device function without errors. As such, it can be commonly found in myriad places of work in Taiwanese society. A rigid set of best practices has arisen surrounding the proper use of Kuai Kuai snacks, such as using green bags only, and ensuring the snacks are not expired.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of companies of Taiwan\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Airaneechya Deva Tula\" (Marathi: ऐरणीच्या देवा तुला) is a 1965 Indian Marathi-language song from the soundtrck album of Sadhi Mansa. It was written by Jagdish Khebudkar and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The song became an enduring classic among Marathi audiences and received numerous awards. Lata Mangeshkar was awarded by the Best Music Director Award by the Maharashtra State Government for her work on the film.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOriginally, the lyricist for this song was supposed to be Yogesh, as decided by the film's producer Bhalji Pendharkar. However, when Bhalji conceived the concept for the film, he made the choice to personally pen the songs, deviating from his initial plan. As a result, he took on the task of writing all the songs for the film himself. Seeking a distinctive piece for the film, Pendharkar promptly reached out to Jagdish Khebudkar. Pendharkar shared intricate details of the film scene with Jagdish, emphasizing the need for a song that would emotionally portray a diligent blacksmith and his wife expressing gratitude to God. The lyrics of the song were planned to be 'Airaneechya Deva Tula Aginphule Vahu De...' However, during the recording session, there was a sudden alteration, and the lyrics were changed to 'Airaneechya Deva Tula Thingi Thingi Vahu De...'. In Marathi, 'Aginphule' and 'Thingi' both signify 'spark'.\n\n\n== Credits ==\nAnandghan – composer\nLata Mangeshkar – vocals\nHariprasad Chaurasia – flute\nJagdish Khebudkar – lyricist\nSaregama India Limited – label\n\n\n== Awards ==\nLata Mangeshkar received the Best Music Director Award from the Maharashtra government for her work on the film, while the song \"Airanichya Deva Tula\" earned the Best Song Award.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jan Nedergaard is a physiologist, academic, and researcher. He is Professor of Physiology at the Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University.Nedergaard's research revolves around elucidating the function and physiological importance of brown adipose tissue, as well as the importance of thermoneutrality in translating mouse data to human conditions. He has authored/co-authored 204 primary articles and 134 reviews and book chapters, with 15 original articles as first author and 117 as corresponding senior author, and was one of 9 scientists at Stockholm University and one of 25 scientists in Sweden who were named on the 2019 Highly Cited Researchers list. His primary publications have appeared in journals such as Nature Medicine, Nature Communications, Cell Metabolism, Nature Metabolism, The EMBO Journal, American Journal of Physiology, BBA Bioenergetics and Biochimie.Nedergaard is a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and is a recipient of the Science Award for Obesity Research, The Friedrich Wassermann Award, and Prize for Scientific Review Writing.\n\n\n== Education ==\nNedergaard pursued studies in chemistry and biology at Göteborg University from 1971 to 1973, graduating in Stockholm with a B.Sc. degree in 1974. Following this, he started his Ph.D. in 1975 at the Wenner-Gren Institute, under the mentorship of Olov Lindberg. He completed his doctoral education with a thesis titled \"Control of Fatty Acid Utilization in Brown Adipose Tissue\" in 1980, subsequently earning a D.Sc. degree in 1982 from Stockholm University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNedergaard assumed the role of associate professor at The Wenner-Gren Institute in 1984, becoming a full professor 1994, and he served as a Member of the Evaluation Committee for Biological Sciences at the Swedish Natural Science Research Council from 1989 to 1995. He served as the Dean of the Subfaculty of Biology in 2003. He was Secretary for the National Committee for Physiology from 2006 to 2016 and has been professor emeritus at Stockholm University since 2019.\n\n\n== Research ==\nNedergaard has focused his research on brown adipose tissue and its role in metabolism, contributing to concepts such as understanding brown adipocyte precursors, the effects of brown adipose tissue on obesity, and its activity in adult humans. He has also advocated using thermoneutrality to apply mouse data to human conditions, highlighting similarities between human and mouse brown adipose tissue.\n\n\n=== Brown adipose tissue ===\nNedergaard's investigations into brown adipose tissue have shed light on signaling pathways and functional roles, highlighting the physiological importance of this tissue. In the 1980s and 1990s, he established distinct signaling pathways and functional roles for adrenergic stimulation of brown adipose tissue and showed that alpha1-adrenergic pathways were mainly ionic, while beta-adrenergic pathways were associated with the activation of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which proved to be specifically present in brown adipose tissue. He studied the regulation of UCP1 activation and co-authored the work \"Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance\" in 2004.In his 2007 paper, Nedergaard pointed out that brown adipose tissue is present and active in adult humans. He has also contributed to the establishment of basic concepts in brown adipose tissue research, including the developmental differences between brown and white adipocyte precursors, where the brown adipocytes precursors initially display myogenic gene expression markers. Additionally, his work highlighted how the absence of brown adipose tissue may contribute to obesity, and that UCP1-expressing cells that can develop in white adipose depots represent a distinct type of adipocyte, termed \"brite\" (now \"beige\") adipocytes, due to their unique gene expression profile compared to classical brown adipocytes.\n\n\n=== Mammalian thermogenesis and metabolism ===\nNedergaard's research on mice and human metabolism has emphasized the significance of thermoneutral temperatures in metabolic physiology. He has discussed the critical influence of ambient temperature on metabolic experiments, particularly regarding nonshivering thermogenesis and its implications for understanding mammalian metabolism, highlighting the importance of examining animals at thermoneutral temperatures. His research investigated the impact of housing temperatures on mouse metabolism, demonstrating that mice under thermoneutral conditions exhibited energy expenditure profiles similar to those of humans. Further expanding on this, he compared human brown adipose tissue (BAT) with classical brown and brite/beige adipose tissues, demonstrating that human BAT shared characteristics with classical mouse BAT, affirming their comparable nature.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2011 – Science Award for Obesity Research, Nutrition et Santé\n2016 – Prize for Scientific Review Writing, American Physiology Society\n2017 – The Friedrich Wassermann Award, European Association\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNedergaard has been living in Sweden since 1971. He is married to Barbara Cannon and they have two sons.\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nCannon, B., & Nedergaard, J. A. N. (2004). Brown adipose tissue: function and physiological significance.

        "content": "Shuga (Kazakh: Шұға; Russian: Шуга) is a salt lake in Zhanasemey District, Abai Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe lake is located 73 km (45 mi) to the west of Semey city, former Semipalatinsk. The area surrounding the lake is used as pasture for local cattle.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nShuga is an endorheic lake in the Shagan river basin. The northeastern and southeastern shores are indented, with sandy bays in some places. The lake lies about 37 km (23 mi) to the south of the Irtysh and 6 km (3.7 mi) to the south of lake Karabastuz. 31 km (19 mi) to the south lies lake Shagan with its nuclear pothole.\nThe water of lake Shuga is saline. The bottom is flat and has a 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) thick layer of mud. The lake fills with snow and rainwater. Its level rises in spring and falls in the summer and autumn months. In dry years, it dries up and turns into a sor. The lake surface rarely freezes completely in the winter owing to its high salinity, but parts of it have ice between the end of November and the second half of April, when the lake is surrounded by snow.\n\n\n== Flora ==\nSteppe vegetation grows in the area surrounding the lake, made up of mainly wormwood, Kochia and, more rarely, Achnatherum. There are no reeds along the shoreline and no aquatic plants in the water.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shuga (lake) at Wikimedia Commons\nОзера и реки Казахстана (in Russian)",

        "content": "The Crown & Anchor Hotel, affectionately known as The Cranker, is a pub in Grenfell Street, Adelaide, South Australia, known for its longstanding live music scene. The current building was designed by noted colonial architect, former mayor of Adelaide, and parliamentarian Thomas English and built in 1879, but it was extensively remodelled and extended in 1928 to designs by Milne, Evans, and Russell. As of April 2024 there are plans for multi-storey accommodation on the block, and only the facade is protected by local heritage listing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNot long after the establishment of the colony of South Australia and the city of Adelaide, in 1844 the Union Brewing & Malting Company began operations on Union Street, with the street being named after the brewery. It continued to operate until 1902. The Union Inn Arms Hotel (or just Union Inn) was built in 1847 on the site on the corner of Grenfell and Union Streets in Adelaide city centre, known as town acre 97. \nA new building was built by 1853, when the Crown & Anchor Hotel was first licensed to sell alcohol. The hotel dug its own well to use as a water source, and this was still in existence in the basement in 2006. On 28 March 1853 licensee James Ellery, who had for the previous six years hosted the Beresford Arms, announced his purchase of \"Crown and Anchor, late the Union Inn, Grenfell-Street East\", where \"the extensive premises\" would enable him to accommodate his old friends\" and others, and that the premises included \"good stabling and stockyards\". From June of that year, a number of \"select\" balls were held at the inn. \nIn March 1879 it was reported that the Crown & Anchor, along with several other inns in Adelaide, had \"insufficient or poor accommodation, and are also little or much out of repair: in need of repair\". In August 1879, leading colonial architect Thomas English called for tenders to undertake the construction work to rebuild the hotel,   and a new two-storey building was constructed to replace the former single-storey building later that year to English's designs, costing around £1,534. English & Soward advertised for tenders for stabling at the rear of the building in March 1880. \nIn October 1928, architects Milne, Evans, and Russell submitted their plans for extensions and alterations to the building. The work was completed in 1929, with the alterations costing £5,000.\nIn 1983, the interior was remodelled.\n\n\n=== Proprietors ===\nJames Ellery was the first licensee of the newly-built Crown & Anchor in 1853.\nIn 1877, C. O'Leary was the licensee. In June 1878, George Beck was landlord, and had his licence extended in 1879 and 1880. He was charged and fined with selling liquor out of hours in 1889. In February 1891, Beck retired from the Crown and Anchor Hotel and moved to the Adelaide Hills with his wife to try his hand at cattle farming, and W.H. Fairlie took over the role as publican. In 1892 Peter Murphy took over, but after being charged with several crimes, relinquished the role to James Logan in 1893. In 1896 the licensees were John Brelag and Henry H. Higgins, who, like several before them, were fined for illegally serving liquor on a Sunday.\nIn September 1907 it was reported that Mrs. J. Calnan had become the new manager, with the article opining that the pub sold \"the best beer in the market in the South Australian Brewing Coy's [sic] celebrated West- End Ale\". On 21 June 1908 Mrs Calnan's husband, John Gilbert, died at the Crown and Anchor, aged only 38.\nIn September 1910, Mary Ann Jakeman was the licensee. She had a dispute which went to court regarding a ring which she alleged had been stolen from her by barman W.T. McPharlin. In May 1914, Louisa Buckingham and Harriet A. Miers, were joint licensees of the Crown and Anchor, and were taken to court for various breaches of the law, including serving liquor on Sundays, as did their successors, Louis P. Morgan and, in 1921 and 1925, George Owens.\nSeveral more proprietors were charged with serving liquor unlawfully, including Mrs Susan Owens, who was the proprietor in 1930 and was charged in 1939. Publicans in the 1940s included Thomas John Street, W. Harrison, and Donald James\nHenry Charles Bishop was the proprietor in 1952.\n\n\n=== Associated incidents ===\nOn 2 May 1871, the landlady of the Crown and Anchor Hotel was arrested for stealing a dress from a local widow. In June 1877, the hotel was the site of an investigation by the city coroner, after the death of a man in the street nearby.On 8 June 1878, when George Beck was landlord, a resident charged another man with theft, so Beck held him until police arrived. The man was found guilty of stealing from three other residents as well, and was sentenced to a sentence of six months with hard labour. Many other crimes were reported to have occurred at the hotel over the years, mostly theft, with residents included among the victims as well as the perpetrators. Illegal gambling was reported a number of times.\nIt was reported that on 18 June 1932 a horse bolted from the Crown & Anchor stables onto Grenfell Street, and was later hit by a car in Pirie Street. The car was damaged but the horse was not badly injured.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nFrom the 1990s onwards, live music became a regular feature in the band room of the Crown & Anchor, which became affectionately known as \"the Cranker\". Musical styles have included rock, garage, punk, folk, and indie music. Aside for numerous local bands, many famous acts played including Tex Perkins, Kim Salmon, Fiona Horne, Rob Snarski, The Spazzys, Dan Luscombe (of The Blackeyed Susans) and Lou Barlow (of Dinosaur Jr).\nThe front bar has often hosted a free DJ set by members of some big names while touring Adelaide, including The Hives, members of The Dandy Warhols, Pond, and Tame Impala. \nThe Crown & Anchor has built a significant reputation in the history of live music in Adelaide, and remains the few in the city centre that still host live music. As of 2024 the pub hosts around 25 to 30 bands a week.\n\n\n=== Threat of demolition ===\nThe Crown & Anchor was heritage-listed listed on 1 November 2001 as a \"Local Heritage Place (Townscape)\". However this heritage listing only covers the facade, meaning that the rest of the building can be demolished.\nIn 2013 South Australian developer Karidis Corporation purchased the land next to the hotel, at 188 Grenfell Street, and  put in an application to construct a 13-storey residential building, but this did not proceed. They acquired the hotel in 2016.\nIn March 2024, it was revealed that Singaporean developer Wee Hur Holdings had  lodged plans to transform the site at 188 and 196 Grenfell Street into multi-level student accommodation. Roxie's, a bar and restaurant, and an event venue called Chateau Apollo are also at the address. The proposal involves \"partial demolition and adaptive reuse\" of the buildings, with a new shop and other amenities on the ground floor. Plans of the proposed development were published on the PlanSA website on 19 April 2024, showing that nothing but the facades on Grenfell and Union Streets would be left under the proposal. These would be restored to their 1920s form, but without the balcony, and the front bar would be transformed into retail areas and a laundry and waste room. There would be 17 floors of studio apartments.\nSince the announcement, public outcry has gathered momentum. A petition was launched to save the pub, and groups and events have been created on social media, to \"Save the Cranker\". In April 2024, musicians from around the country have posted pictures of themselves holding \"Save the Cranker\" signs, and the Adelaide Music Collective announced the pending introduction of the pub to the SA Music Hall of Fame. Australian Greens MLC member Robert Simms introduced a motion to state parliament calling on the Malinauskas government to strengthen heritage laws protect the venue. The petition mentions Adelaide's status as a UNESCO City of Music, and asks for \"a solution that demonstrates our State's commitment to the UNESCO listing\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe design of the 1853 building designed by Thomas English is neo-classical style, with arched windows decorated by surrounding mouldings, and the facade is rendered. On the parapet above the corner entrance, it has a moulded crown and anchor insignia. However, the 1929 alterations were extensive, and included removal of many of the decorative features, as well as the addition of a long balcony along the Grenfell Street frontage.\n\n\n== Location and services ==\nThe Crown & Anchor's address is 196-198 Grenfell Street, also known as 35-39 Union Street, as it is on the corner of the two streets.\n\"The Cranker\" hosts live music or comedy seven nights a week, many with free entry, and serves meals upstairs at \"Midnight Spaghetti\".\nIt is open from Monday to Saturday from 12pm until 3am, and Sunday from 2pm until 3am. As of April 2024 the publican is Tom Skipper.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Nanette Wylde is an American artist and writer. Wylde is known for her early incorporation of digital media as a fine art media, her work in net.art, electronic literature, and artwork which takes book form.\nWylde makes works which are interdisciplinary, conceptual, narrative, and often involve collaboration with other artists.  She works in many media including artist's books, digital and electronic media, installation, printmaking, and social practice.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWylde was born in California and grew up in San Jose.\nWylde's education includes an MFA from the Ohio State University where she studied interactive multimedia and printmaking (1996), a Bachelor's from San Jose State University in Behavioral Science (1986), and an associate degree from West Valley College in Saratoga, California (1981).\nWylde claims her early influences to be artists Laurie Anderson, Jenny Holzer, Cindy Sherman, Ann Hamilton, Christine Tamblyn, and studying with Rupert Garcia at San Jose State University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWylde is a narrative artist with focus on storytelling with socio-cultural content. Many of her works are about stereotyping and involve cultural critique. Her themes include re-interpreting historical perspectives, and the reliability of information-based media. Later works have an environmental focus. She often includes audience participatory elements in her projects which allow participants to contribute to the works in meaningful and permanent ways. Wylde considers herself to be a conceptual artist and calls herself a cultural worker.\nHer electronic works have been exhibited internationally.\nMany reviewers comment on the humor in Wylde's work. In a discussion of a Jessica Gomula exhibition, Kim De Vries references Wylde, \"This irreverence can be found in other artists working today such as Nanette Wylde . . .  and reflects a contemporary skepticism about artistic theories and movements as such; a resistance to taking any of this system of artistic production and criticism too seriously.”\nCollaboration with other artists is common in Wylde's practice with her primary collaboration partner being Kent Manske. Notable projects Manske and Wylde have worked together on include Foodies, Meaning Maker, and You are the Tree.\nHer works are taught in university level literature and art classes.\n\n\n=== Digital media ===\nWylde began using digital media tools, Photoshop and Painter software, to create images in 1991. She often combined software with traditional printmaking such as lithography and relief printing. Her work is included in several early software (Photoshop and Painter) publications.\nWylde began working in interactive multimedia in 1994 while studying at Ohio State University's Advanced Computing Center for Art and Design. Her graduate thesis project was an interactive multimedia artwork titled A Brief History. The project was feminist in content, focusing on women's history and celebrating female diversity. The project included an interactive installation of images mounted on small wood blocks which the audience could move about on a series of small shelves to create their own narratives.\n\n\n=== Electronic works and net.art ===\nWylde creates net.art projects and electronic projects which required a computer to be experienced, most frequently in an electronic flipbook format. Her electronic projects often allow audience input. Many use the computer's random function.\nCarolyn Guertin writes about Wylde's electronic flipbooks, Arrested, Belief Manifesto and haikU, “Drawing from three different data streams, these texts recombine them to create instant works of art from a community experience. Arrested works along similar lines but more closely shows a genealogy with text-based experiments by feminist artists like Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger. Exploring our expectations of social posturing and the politics of rhetoric, Arrested toys with our expectations. Combining racial and ethnic groups with the politics of everyday activities, the texts consistently test our assumptions and challenges us to rethink them. While Arrested does not require the reader to input material, it does work to restate the reader in relation to the material she is reading. In short, It requires us to change our perspective and insert ourselves into the textual community to experience new points of view.” \nElizabeth Joe writes about Wylde's 2003 net.art project The Daily Planet Interactive: \"In this project, she specifically parodies information delivery systems and (American) media culture. It is an interactive Net art project that aims to foster a new viewer outlook with respect to cultural identity and accepted social practices that are one-sided.” AND \"Wylde addresses the ideas of society being consumed with the need to attain information by partially obscuring information from the viewer. Moreover, she continues to cleverly play with viewer expectations for she does not allow the headlines to run consistent with the newspaper format headings. In both respects, the viewers’ expectations are not met – they do not receive the information they want. These ideas closely mimic Wylde's underlying theme of how the media controls/manipulates information and only disseminates information they think should be important to the masses.” Joe continues, \"It is also important to note Wylde’s tactic with respect to further addressing the idea that the media only distributes one-way communication to its viewers. Newspapers can be perceived as a social construction that propagates information for a specific purpose. Through her web project viewers are afforded 'two-way communication' where they are free to not only take in media headlines and personal entries, but are also afforded the opportunity to voice their questions and opinions.”\nWylde's electronic project Storyland is included in the first Electronic Literature Collection published by the Electronic Literature Organization.\n\n\n=== Artist's books ===\nWylde works in the genre artist's books in which the artwork references or takes book form. She was commissioned by The San Francisco Center for the Book for their first year of small plates book projects in 2008. Wylde's artist's books have exhibited widely, won awards, and are included in international book arts collections.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAchenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco, California\nAlmutanabbi Street Starts Here archive, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Butler Library, Columbia University, New York, New York\nBaylor University Libraries, Waco, Texas\nBoise State University Albertson's Library\nDecker Library, Maryland Institute College of Art\nDuke University Library, Durham, NC\nGeorge Mason University, Fenwick Library, Fairfax, VA\nHarvard University Fine Arts Library, Cambridge, MA\nMIT Libraries, Cambridge, MA\nOlin Library, Cornell University, Ithica, New York\nSan Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, CA\nSanta Clara University, Santa Clara, CA\nSavannah College of Art and Design, Jen Library, Savannah, GA\nStaatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Haus Potsdamer Straße, Berlin, Germany\nStanford University Libraries, Stanford, California\nThe Center for the Study of the Book, The Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\nTufts University Tisch Library, Medford, MA\nUniversity of California, Berkeley: Artists' Books Collection\nUC Davis Shields Library, Davis, CA\nUC Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO\nUniversity of Iowa Library, Iowa City, Iowa\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA\nUniversity of Washington Libraries, Seattle, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In April 2024, heavy rain severely impacted states in the Persian Gulf, causing flash flooding across the region. Several states recorded nearly a year's worth of rain in a single day. The floods had a significant impact across the region, with Oman and the United Arab Emirates being particularly affected, resulting in the deaths of at least 32 people, including 19 in Oman and 8 in Iran. Southeastern Iran, Yemen, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia also experienced heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nThe Persian Gulf region is known for its hot and dry weather, though heavy rains causing flooding have also occurred with greater regularity in recent years.  Britain's Royal Meteorological Society stated that the likely cause is a mesoscale convective system. Senior forecaster Esraa Alnaqbi of the UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) further explained that \"a low pressure system in the upper atmosphere, coupled with low pressure at the surface had acted like a pressure 'squeeze' on the air. That squeeze, intensified by the contrast between warmer temperatures at ground level and colder temperatures higher up, created the conditions for the powerful thunderstorm\". Meteorologists from the University of Reading affirmed that the heavy rain was caused by large thunderstorms.\nRichard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading and Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, both linked the unusual weather to climate change, stating that \"rainfall was becoming much heavier around the world as the climate warms\". The region has previously been hit by heat waves and cyclones in recent years, and with rising temperatures and humidity levels, researchers expect an increased risk of flooding in the Persian Gulf. \n\n\n=== Cloud seeding allegations ===\nIn the aftermath of the floods, some news outlets quoted specialist meteorologist Ahmed Habib linking the heavy downpours to the UAE's cloud seeding program. Due to the arid desert climate and high temperatures, cloud seeding has been used previously in the United Arab Emirates in order to combat water scarcity.\nDismissing the allegations, Omar Al Yazeedi, the deputy director-general of the UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), said the institution \"did not conduct any seeding operations during this event\". Other news commentators have also dismissed the link to cloud seeding, stating that the technology marginally increases rainfall and that the UAE's cloud seeding program is localised to the eastern part of the country, away from densely populated metropolitan areas; other experts, such as the Royal Meteorological Society, stated that cloud seeding would only have a minimal effect, with others even stating that the focus on cloud seeding is \"misleading\".\nScientists from the University of Reading, whose cloud seeding program is used by the UAE, denied that cloud seeding was to blame for the heavy rainfall, given that the large-scale weather pattern was predicted in advance and was too large to be influenced by cloud seeding. They added that the effects of cloud seeding are typically short-lived, lasting for a few hours.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Oman ===\nIn Oman, at least 19 people were killed due to the floods. This included 10 schoolchildren and their driver whose vehicle was washed away by flood waters in Samad al-Shan on 14 April. Rescuers found the body of a girl in Saham. The hardest hit region was the Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate where widespread flooding was reported. Some flights were cancelled or delayed from Muscat International Airport.\n\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n\nThe rains began in UAE late on Monday 15 April 2024, intensifying the next day on Tuesday 16 April 2024, and officially concluding on Wednesday 17 April 2024. The UAE witnessed a record-breaking rainfall in a 24 hour period, surpassing Emirati meteorological data since records began in 1949. According to the National Centre of Meteorology, the highest rainfall was recorded in the Khatm Al Shakla area in Al Ain, reaching 254.8 mm (10.03 in) in less than 24 hours. Widespread flooding was reported in all seven emirates. Ahead of the flooding, an estimated rainfall of 40 mm (1.6 in), up to 100 mm (3.9 in) was estimated in some parts of the UAE.\nOne Emirati citizen, a 70-year-old man, died after his car was swept away by floods in a wadi in Ras Al Khaimah. Three overseas Filipino workers also died, two after being trapped inside a vehicle trapped in flooding, and the third after their vehicle fell into a sinkhole. Landslides were reported in Ras Al Khaimah and Al Ain. Residents were warned to stay home and avoid driving unless absolutely necessary. Internet and power outages were widespread as residents lost water. In the entire country, schools and the private sector were instructed to work the remainder of the week (excluding Monday) remotely from home.\nDubai Metro services were severely impacted, leaving around 200 commuters stranded at several stations. Intercity bus service on the Dubai-Abu Dhabi, Dubai-Sharjah, and Dubai-Ajman routes were suspended. A total of 1,244 flights at Dubai International Airport were cancelled over a two-day period with 41 diverted. All Flydubai flights scheduled for departure on 16 April from Dubai were cancelled. At the Dubai airport, a total of 164 mm (6.45 in) of rain fell.\nThe AFC Asian Champions League semi-final football match between the Emirati Al Ain and the Saudi Al Hilal football clubs, due to be played in Al Ain, was postponed for a day due to the floods.\n\n\n=== Bahrain ===\n\nHeavy rainfall and thunderstorms occurred on 15 and 16 April that resulted in widespread flooding, leading to cars being abandoned on roads. According to the Bahrain meteorological directorate, an average of 67.6 mm (2.66 in) of rainfall was reported over 48 hours, the second highest rainfall recorded in Bahraini history. The Bahraini Ministry of Interior issued a public safety warning to residents to stay at home. The Ministry of Education announced a closure of schools and higher education institutions as a result of the floods. Windspeed gusts of 70 km/h were estimated. A supermarket's ceiling in the town of Sitra collapsed due to the rain.\n\n\n=== Qatar ===\nHeavy rainfall and strong winds were largely confined to the northern parts of the country centered around the towns of Madinat ash Shamal and Ar-Ruʼays. Scattered showers were reported in Doha. Schools and public buildings were closed due to the weather, with services shifted online for the day.\n\n\n=== Iran ===\nHeavy rain and flash flooding were also reported in southeastern Iran. The provinces of Sistan-Baluchistan, Hormozgan and Kerman were the worst affected, with 8 people killed in Sistan-Baluchistan and 3 people reported missing in Kerman province.\n\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nHeavy rainfall was reported in the Eastern Province. Widespread flooding affected the province, particularly the capital Dammam, resulting in road tunnel closures and the closure of schools.\n\n\n=== Kuwait ===\nKuwait's meteorological agency warned of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms on 16 April.\n\n\n=== Yemen ===\nTorrential rain and flash flooding occurred in Yemen's Hadhramaut Governorate on 17 April, with one death reported and widespread damage to property. Heavy rain in the mountains close to the port of Mukalla raised the possibility of landslides.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nOn 17 April, Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa announced plans to assess and compensate residents with rainfall-related damages to their homes. In the leadup to the heavy rainfall, a nationwide emergency joint task force was set up between the Ministry of Works and the four municipality councils of Bahrain to coordinate flood relief efforts including the removing of rainwater from flooded streets and pumping it to Al-Luzi lake.\nThe Royal Oman Police conducted 152 operations, rescuing 1,630 individuals stranded from flooding across the country.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Hissein Brahim Taha offered condolences to flood victims.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Central Asian floods\n2024 United Arab Emirates floods\n\n\n== References ==",

Crosby defeated incumbent Democratic Governor John Hubbard, Anti-Maine Law nominee Anson G. Chandler and Free Soil Party nominee and former member of the Maine Senate Ezekiel Holmes. However, as no candidate received a majority of the total votes cast as was required by Maine law, the election was forwarded to the Maine legislature, who chose Crosby as governor, despite the fact he only came in second in the popular vote.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, 13 September 1852, Whig nominee William G. Crosby won the election despite losing the popular vote by a margin of 12,872 votes against his foremost opponent incumbent Democratic governor John Hubbard, thereby gaining Whig control over the office of governor. Crosby was sworn in as the 23rd Governor of Maine on 5 January 1853.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Monument to Maria Luisa di Borbone is a marble statuary group depicting the former Duchess of Lucca, sculpted by Lorenzo Bartolini, and located in the center of the piazza in front of the Ducal Palace of Lucca, in the region of Tuscany, Italy.\nAfter the death of Maria Luisa in 1824, the commune voted for the creation of a statue in her honor, and contracted for a design by Lorenzo Bartolini. The sculpture is in the center of the large rectangular Piazza Grande, or Piazza Napoleone, in front of the palace had been cleared in 1806 by the Napoleonic government, in the process razing houses, warehouses, and the church of San Pietro Maggiore. Initially a statue honoring Napoleon had been planned for this spot, but Maria Luisa, who held a personal antipathy to the former French emperor and his family (Napoleon's sister Elisa Bonaparte had ruled Lucca as Princess of Lucca and Piombino until 1814), squelched that idea in favor of a monument to Charles II, Duke of Parma. That monument was putatively moved to the ramparts of the town. In 1823, the year before the death of Maria Luisa, it was decided to dedicate a statue in her honor in gratitude for her patronage of the city aqueduct. The monument was designed by the Neoclassical Tuscan sculptor Bartolini.\n\nThe awkward statue depicts the somewhat rotund Duchess with nake boy at her side. He holds a cornucopia, she holds a roll of paper and a peculiar staff. The arrangement, also somewhat awkwardly, does have some similarities (woman with staff beside a young boy) with Bartolini's earlier Monument to Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rabbi Yose Hacohen (Jose ha-cohen, Yosei the priest; Hebrew: רבי יוסי הכהן) was a second-generation Tanna who lived at the end of the first century CE, a student of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai.\nHis Halakhic opinion is only mentioned once in the Mishnah. The Talmud says about him that he learned Maaseh Merkabah with Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, and that his teacher, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, praised his knowledge of Kabbalistic wisdom.\nThe Mishnah relates that his teacher and colleagues referred to him as \"pious\" (\"hasid\"). Some identify him with Rabbi Yose Katnuta (\"the Small\"), about whom the Mishna states: \"When Rabbi Yosei the Small died, that was the end of the pious.\" Some claim that the reason he appears so rarely in the Mishna is because of his humility. The Talmud says of him that he was so careful about the laws of Shabbat  that, \"a document in his handwriting was never found in the hand of a gentile,\" to prevent even a gentile from transgressing Shabbat by carrying his letter in a public place.\nRabbi Yose also appears as a Biblical commentator, when he explained difficult verses before Rabban Gamaliel, and as an ethical teacher of Musar when he was asked by his teacher, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, \"Which is the straight path that a person should cleave to?\" Rabbi Yose answered, \"A good neighbor.\" To the converse question, of \"What is the wicked path that a person should distance himself from?\" he answered, \"A bad neighbor.\" He is also mentioned as someone who comforted Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai after the death of his son.\nMordecai Margalioth claims that Rabbi Yosi Hacohen should not be confused with Rabbi Yosef Hacohen, who is mentioned in the Mishna but was not one of the sages.\n\n\n== Burial place ==\nThere is a supposed grave of Rabbi Yose HaKohen in Alma, though it is also claimed that he was buried near Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai in Tiberias. Local residents mark the anniversary of his death (Yom Hillula) on 15th of Iyar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramalina sarahae is a species of fruticose lichen in the family Ramalinaceae. This species is endemic to the Channel Islands of California, USA.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nRamalina sarahae was first described in 2018 by the lichenologists Kerry Knudsen, James Lendemer, and Jana Kocourková. The species epithet honors Sarah Chaney, a retired ecologist and long-time Channel Islands National Park employee who guided various lichenological studies. The species shares similarities with Ramalina lacera in lacking chondroid strands in the cortex, but differs by having only linear pseudocyphellae and lacking soralia, and a growth form with thinner branches.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Ramalina sarahae is caespitose, usually rounded, densely branched, and arises from a single holdfast. It reaches up to 4.5 cm (1.8 in) in height and 6 cm (2.4 in) in width. The branches are yellowish-green, smooth to irregularly ridged, especially near the thallus base, and are more or less dichotomously or irregularly branching. Pseudocyphellae are commonly found on the margins and are linear. The branches are solid and bifacial with a cortex thickness of 30–40 µm without chondroid strands. The algal layer is discontinuous, and the medulla consists of dirty white, thin-walled hyphae.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nRamalina sarahae is known only from two locations: San Miguel Island and San Nicolas Island, southern California, where it grows on the caudices (the thickened, woody, and persistent base) of Coreopsis gigantea. Its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution indicate that it is narrowly endemic.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Intrepido (English: \"Intrepid\") was an Italian Indomito-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1913, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign until she was sunk in 1915.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nIntrepido was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, on 1 June 1910. She was launched on 7 August 1912 and commissioned on 6 February 1913.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== 1913–1914 ===\nIntrepido was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Squadron. After shakedown and training, she took part in various cruises in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean Sea during 1913. She was transferred to the 2nd Destroyer Squadron in 1914 and during that year engaged in minesweeping operations, searching for stray mines in the southern Adriatic Sea.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Intrepido, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) De Grenet,  and the destroyers Indomito, Impavido, Impetuoso, Insidioso, and Irrequieto made up the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. The squadron, under the command of Capitano de fregata (Frigate Captain) P. Orsini, was based at Taranto, although although either Impetuoso or Indomito or both were visiting La Spezia that day.\nOn 5 June 1915, Intrepido escorted the British Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Dublin as Dublin bombarded Donzella on the coast of Dalmatia. On 9 June 1915, Intrepido, Impetuoso, Indomito, Insidioso, Irrequieto, the protected cruiser Quarto, and the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Ardito, and Audace escorted the armored cruisers  Giuseppe Garibaldi and Vettor Pisani as they participated in a bombardment of the lighthouses at the Cape of Rodon and Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of the Principality of Albania.\nIn the early hours of 17 July 1915 Intrepido, Animoso, Irrequieto, and Quarto bombarded the radiotelegraph station and other Austro-Hungarian military installations on Šipan (known to the Italians as Giuppana), an island off the coast of Dalmatia. The bombardment, as well as another one carried out by the 5th Naval Division, was interrupted when the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani of the 5th Naval Division sighted an Austro-Hungarian submarine at 04:25. After the Italian ships began their return voyage to Italy, the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-4 attacked at 04:40 and torpedoed Giuseppe Garibaldi, which sank within minutes. Intrepido took part in the rescue effort, which saved 525 men out of the 578 on board Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nA few hours after an Austro-Hungarian Navy force subjected the Palagruža (known to the Italians as the Pelagosa) archipelago in the Adriatic Sea to a heavy bombardment during the night of 16–17 August 1915, Intrepido, Impavido, Quarto, Animoso, and Ardito, which were on a cruise in the Adriatic Sea north of the line Brindisi–Cattaro, interrupted their operations to respond. They reached Palagruža at around 10:00 on 17 August 1915.\nOn 3 December 1915 Intrepido — now under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain)  Leva — along with Impetuoso , Indomito, Insidioso, and Irrequieto got underway from Brindisi to escort one of the first supply convoys for Italian troops in Albania. As the convoy — composed of the troop transports Re Umberto and Valparaiso, carrying a total of 1,800 men and 150 draft animals — approached Shëngjin on the coast of Albania, Re Umberto, with 765 men on board, hit a mine laid by the Imperial German Navy submarine UC-14, broke in two, and sank in 15 minutes. Rescuers saved 712 men, of whom Intrepido rescued about a hundred.\nAfter disembarking the survivors at Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in Albania, Intrepido got back underway to carry out an anti-submarine patrol. At 14:00 on 4 December 1915, while returning from her patrol, Intrepido struck a mine south of the Karaburun Peninsula on the coast of Albania. The explosion blew off her bow and tore apart her forward superstructure, killing one officer and three enlisted men and wounding others, including Leva, who suffered serious injuries. Intrepido′s crew beached her near Point Linguetta to prevent her from sinking, but she was deemed unsalvageable. She was stripped of her guns, torpedo tubes, and other useful equipment and abandoned. A few days later her wreck sank in deeper water.\n\n\n== Wreck ==\nIntrepido′s wreck was identified on the seabed near Point Linguetta in April 2007. It is partially destroyed, with debris scattered over an area of approximately 32 square metres (38 sq yd).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco.

        "content": "Friedrich Christian Lesser (12 May 1692 – 17 September 1754) was a German Protestant pastor, naturalist and antiquarian who promoted natural theology through the study of insects, minerals, and plants which he formulated in his books Insecto-theologia (1738), Testaceo-theologia (1744) and Litho-theologie (1735). He lived in Nordhausen and also wrote a history of the city.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nLesser was the son of a Protestant priest Philipp Jacob Lesser (1656–1724) in St. Nicolai, Nordhausen. His mother Emilia Sophia née Rothmaler was also from a family of clergy, the daughter of Johann Elias Rothmaler who was a court preacher in Rudolstadt Fortress and an archdeacon in the city of Rudolstadt. He was taught at home and at the Nordhäusen Gymnasium after which he went to Halle to study medicine. Here he was influenced by August Hermann Francke, a friend of his father, and he shifted to theology. He studied at Halle and Leipzig but had to return home following a terrible fire in September 1712 at Nordhausen that destroyed his home. He returned home from studies in 1715 to become a private tutor to the children of Karl Heinrich von Grossen at Kinderode and later Großwerther. In 1716 he went to the pastorate of Frauenberg. He married Johanna Maria the daughter of merchant Adam Wolfram in 1717 and they had four children but she died in 1729. In 1741 he became parish priest at Jacobi Church. Lesser took an interest in natural theology and in his book Insecto-theologia examined how a study of insects celebrated the wisdom of the Creator. In a similar vein, he also looked at rocks and minerals for signs of God. The book on insect theology was translated into French in 1742, Italian in 1751, and went into several German editions. Lesser was aware of the work of Jan Swammerdam on bees and of other scientific advances of the period. Lesser wrote that \"The vilest insect is the work of omnipotence, worthy of the highest admiration. It is endowed with so many perfections, that the most powerful monarch, or the most skillful artists, can produce nothing to be compared with it. God alone can work those wonders, and he presents them to us, not as models for our imitation, but as so many testimonies of its power and wisdom.\" He sought to demonstrate the art and skills of God and supported the contemporary ideas of the 'chain of being' and of 'spontaneous generation', that insects were generated from decaying matter.\nLesser was elected to the Leopoldina Academy on December 8, 1735, under the name of Aristomachus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOn Litho-theologie\nTestaceo-theologia (1744)\nLesser on reproduction in insects\nInsecto-theologia (1738)\nTheologie des insectes (1742 French translation with commentary by Lyonnet)\nInsect-theology (1799 English translation of Lyonnet)\nHistorische Nachrichten von der Käyserl. und des Heil.

The program is intended to replace the Air Force's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fleet.In 2008, Australia planned to buy 100 F-35A models, shortly after this, the amount in which Australia had planned to buy had been reduced. During the prime ministership of Tony Abbott, in 2014, Australia agreed to purchase an extra 58 of the fighters, bringing Australia's total order to 72 of the aircraft. The first Australian F-35 was delivered in 2014, from an American air base in Fort Worth, Texas. At the end of 2020, The RAAF had reported that 60 out of the 72 aircraft ordered had been delivered, with the final 12 to be delivered by the end of 2023.Currently, the Royal Australian Air Force maintains three squadrons of the F-35A throughout Australia, one each at the airbases of: RAAF Base Williamtown; RAAF Base Tindal, and a training squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n2014: Australia's first F-35, known as AU-1 is delivered from Fort Worth, Texas\n2015: First Australian pilot goes through F-35 training at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida\n2017: F-35 makes Australian public debut at Avalon Airshow\n2018: F-35 Training Center is stood up at RAAF Base Williamtown\n2018: First aircraft arrives for permanent basing at RAAF Base Williamtown\n2020: Australia declares IOC\n2021: Establishment of Williamtown Depot capability\n2021: First aircraft arrives for permanent basing at RAAF Base Tindal\n2023: Asia-Pacific Regional Warehouse IOC\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hippocrate (English: Interns) is a French television medical drama series, which was broadcast from 26 November 2018 on Canal+. It was created and directed by former medical doctor Thomas Lilti as a spin-off from his 2014 film of the same name. The series is set in the Raymond Poincaré Hospital and follows three interns, Chloé (Louise Bourgoin), Alyson (Alice Belaïdi) and  Hugo (Zacharie Chasseriaud), as well as forensic pathologist Arben (Karim Leklou). All four are assigned as ward doctors to the Internal Medicine department when the usual doctors on duty have been home quarantined due to an unknown infection. Hippocrate's first season of eight episodes was co-written by Lilti, Anaïs Carpita and Claude Le Pape. Hospital scenes were filmed in a disused wing of the Centre Hospitalier Robert Ballanger (Robert Ballanger Hospital Centre) using equipment from the associated hospital.\nLilti announced in November 2018 that shooting the second season was due to begin in late 2019. Filming of that season began in January 2020 but was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. During France's first nation-wide lockdown, from March to May 2020, Lilti resumed medical duties to assist hospital staff where he had been filming and also provided medical equipment, which had been purchased for the series. The second season was broadcast from 5 April 2021 with Bourgoin, Belaïdi, Leklou and Chasseriaud reprising their roles. For this series the hospital's Emergency Department is flooded and patients are transferred to Internal Medicine where the team deal with greater work loads and personal issues. All 16 episodes of both seasons were streamed in Australia via SBS on Demand from 8 September 2022. In June 2021 Lilti announced plans for a third season, filming started in March 2023 with broadcasting due in September 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRaymond Poincaré Hospital's Internal Medicine's staff are sent home to quarantine after a patient died of an unknown pathogen. Only three interns are available to treat the ward's patients: Chloé, Alyson and Hugo. They work with reduced nursing staff. Monitoring them, from home, is Manuel. Pathologist Arben is reassigned to Internal Medicine. Chloé hides her medical condition as she aspires to become an Intensive care unit (ICU) doctor. Hugo's mother, Muriel, heads ICU and had mentored Chloé. Hugo seeks popularity with his peers and over-estimates his abilities. He initially lies about his mistake with an attempted suicide patient, Marion. Alyson and Hugo become lovers. With hospital administrator Nathalie's permission the interns reduce patient numbers to lighten their work load. Muriel opportunistically moves her post-ICU patients into Internal Medicine's newly vacated rooms. Alyson, who is hesitant and lacking confidence, acknowledges her mistake when testing Marion. Chloé collapses from her heart valve problems and administration's lawyers prepare to foist blame for Marion's death onto her. Alyson, Arben and Hugo rally to support Chloé and apprise Marion's parents of the ward's conditions. Quarantine is lifted with the pathogen partly identified as a tropical, mosquito-borne virus. Manuel and other doctors resume work.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\nLouise Bourgoin as Chloé Antovska: fourth year intern, Manuel's domestic partner, Muriel's former protégé, treats female-to-male (FtoM) and post-ICU patients.

        "content": "All's Well is the fourth extended play by American singer Jesse McCartney. It was released on April 5, 2024, by Blue Suit Records. The EP marks the artist's first release of original music since the COVID-19 pandemic, and following his previous album New Stage.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2019, McCartney stated \"As I get older I do understand and realize what the important things are in life because trying to juggle a personal and professional life can be complicated.\" . But due to the Covid-19 pandemic McCartney had to take a step back from everything he was gearing up for, but what helped him in this new stage of life was his then fiancé Katie Peterson\n\nMcCartney self described this release as \"a collection of songs I've been working on over the last year.\" and admitted his admiration to old school '70s pop as his inspiration. Though much like his previous release, he cites his wife as a key influence as he continues entering new stages in his life.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Faux Fur\" - \"a retro R&B groove and funk, layered with soulful vocals\" track that ended on Rolling Stone Magazine's \"Songs You Need To Know\" list.\nMake A Baby - The second single was released - or as McCartney stated \"Due Date\". The song and promotional pictures features American rapper Yung Gravy.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe EP received generally positive reviews from music critics. Martina Rebecca Inchingolo from ABC News reviewed the release as his music is aging like \"fine wine\" and his way of communicating his experiences through his music is his best way possible. Ending the review stating \"short but sweet EP that celebrates life, love, and lust.\"Emily Piper from Technique stated \"McCartney has always been a strong force in the music industry, and \"All's Well\" only supports his claim to fame. This project is a reflection of the maturity and experiences he achieved across his life. Whether in the darkness or light, there is a song to speak to everyone and a story to unify its listeners.\"The Sun described the release as \"a fun, supple and fascinating step on the multi-talented multi-hyphenate's journey of expressing a true self beyond the expectations and demands — equal parts vintage Hall and Oates, postmodern swag, and honeymoon sincerity packaged in that undeniable McCartney charm.\"\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nA US tour to promote the release began on April 12, 2024, and will end on May 16.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Disappear Completely (Spanish: Desaparecer por completo) is a 2022 Mexican horror thriller film directed and co-produced by Luis Javier Henaine, who also co-wrote the film with Ricardo Aguado-Fentanes. It stars Harold Torres as Santiago, an unscrupulous tabloid photojournalist who, after visiting a crime scene, begins to gradually lose each of his five senses.\nDisappear Completely premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2022. It received a theatrical release in Mexico on 29 February 2024 by Mantícora Distribución, and was released on Netflix on 12 April 2024.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHarold Torres as Santiago\nTeté Espinoza\nFermín Martínez\nVicky Araico\nNorma Reyna\nQuetzalli Cortés\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film a score of three out of four stars; he compared it favorably to the works of John Carpenter or Wes Craven, praising its cinematography and Torres's performance. IndieWire's Alison Foreman gave the film a grade of \"B–\", likening it to the American films Drag Me to Hell (2009) and Nightcrawler (2014), and writing that, \"its skin-crawling presentation (you will feel, smell, and even taste a few scenes) and uniquely perverse consideration of a terrifying concept make it worth seeing.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDisappear Completely at IMDb",

        "content": "Emir Kir (born 17 October 1968) is a Belgian politician who has been mayor of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode since 2012, having been re-elected in 2018. He was a member of the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) until he was expelled from the party in January 2020 after contacts with the Turkish far-right.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKir was born on 17 October 1968 in Charleroi, Wallonia, the son of Turkish immigrants who came to work in the Belgian mines as guest workers in the 1960s. The family settled in Sint-Joost-ten-Node in 1977, following a mining accident which condemned his father to disability.\nBetween 1987 and 1989, he studied political science at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). He falsely claimed to be a \"political science graduate\" before a journalist revealed that he had lied since he had not submitted his final dissertation. He was only a candidate.\nWith a working-class background and admiration for Guy Cudell (mayor of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode for over forty years), he joined the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000, he worked as a social worker.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2000, Kir presented himself as a candidate in the local elections in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. Obtaining the second highest score in the municipality, he became alderman for Social Affairs and Public Education.\nIn 2004, following the regional elections, in which he achieved an unexpected score: 7,000 preferential votes (second PS score behind Charles Picqué), he left his post as alderman to become Secretary of State for Monuments and Sites and Public Cleanliness in the Brussels government, as well as Minister of Social Action, Family and Sport in the French Community Commission (COCOF).\nIn 2006, he took part in the local elections, winning more votes than the then-mayor Jean Demannez, but did not (yet) claim the maïorate, as he was still Secretary of State in the Brussels government, becoming instead first alderman. He also participated in the 2007 federal elections, was elected, but did not take office for the same reason. In 2009, he remained Secretary of State following the regional elections, but stepped down in the middle of the legislature. He also retained his seat as Minister in the COCOF.\nIn 2012, he ran in the local elections, again winning the greatest number of votes, higher than that of the head of the list Jean Demannez. He was elected and became mayor of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode at the end of 2012, after stormy negotiations. This made Kir the first mayor of Turkish origin in the French-speaking part of Belgium, as well as the first mayor of foreign origin in the Brussels region. His positions in the Brussels government were transferred to fellow party member Rachid Madrane.\nIn 2014, he was appointed by the Brussels government as chairman of the Brussels Regional Investment Company (GIMB). He was elected to the Federal Parliament for the first time following the 2014 elections. He was re-elected as mayor of Sint-Joost-ten-Noode following the 2018 elections, with 3,904 preferential votes and, again, an absolute majority.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn November 2005, Kir failed in a lawsuit against journalists for calling him \"a denier, a liar and a delinquent\". The court found it proven that Kir had taken part in a demonstration which had as its aim Armenian genocide denial. In 2015, Kir was absent from a one-minute silence in the Chamber of Representatives for the centenary of the Armenian genocide. He was called upon by Socialist Party (PS) leader Elio Di Rupo and told to follow the party line and vote in favour of recognition of the genocide.\nKir was a member of the PS between 1995 and 2020. He was expelled from the party following a controversial meeting with a delegation of Turkish mayors which also included representatives from the far-right MHP party.\nIn April 2019, when interviewed by Al Arabiya of Saudi Arabia, Kir compared Belgium to Nazi Germany for the Plan Canal, a large revitalization program which also included an initiative against Islamic extremism in Brussels. The following month, he distributed campaign leaflets saying that the plan was an attack on Muslims, for which he was accused by other parties of sectarianism and clientelism.\nIn April 2024, Kir issued a ban on the right-wing National Conservatism Conference to be held in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, citing \"ensuring of public security\" and saying that the \"extreme-right is not welcome\" in Brussels. Kir's decision was criticized by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, and the Prime Minister of Belgium, Alexander De Croo. The ban was legally challenged by the organizers and the Council of State subsequently allowed the conference to continue, in compliance with freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 26 of the Belgian Constitution.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n Commander of the Order of Leopold II\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramalina azorica is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), fruticose lichen in the family Ramalinaceae. It is found in the Azores, where it grows on coastal rocks.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe lichen was formally described as a new species in 2008 by the lichenologists André Aptroot and Felix Schumm. The type specimen was collected by Schumm in the Azores, specifically at Ponta da Ferraia on São Miguel Island. The collection occurred at a minimal elevation of just 1 metre above sea level on June 4, 2003.\n\n\n== Description ==\nRamalina azorica has a dull, shrubby thallus that clusters into dense groups of 5–25 branches. These branches originate from a commonly dark, often blackish base, and can extend up to 11 cm (4.3 in) in length. They are oriented upright to hanging and have a greenish to yellowish-grey hue. The thallus is somewhat fragile and shows a high degree of variability in its branching patterns. Some branches resemble antlers, while others are denser and become cylindrical towards the tips. The surface of these branches is wrinkled, featuring cartilaginous (cartilage-like) strands that rise to the surface to form lines known as pseudocyphellae—areas where the cortex is partially absent, revealing the underlying layer.\nIn cross-section, the branches are flattened and can be distinctly contorted in a cork-screw-like fashion. They typically have a diameter of up to about 5 mm, although they are often much slimmer. This species does not produce soredia, which are small, powdery propagules used for asexual reproduction. Reproductive structures called apothecia appear along the margins of the branches. These are 2–4 mm in diameter and can be flat to convex in shape. The ascospores within these structures are divided by a single septum, are clear (hyaline), and range from straight to slightly curved, measuring 8.8–12 µm long and 3.3–4.4 µm wide. Additionally, pycnidia—small fruiting bodies that release asexual spores—are located near the margins of the branches and are pale in colour.\nChemically, the medulla (the innermost layer of the thallus) does not react to common chemical spot tests (C−, K−, Pd−), but it does fluoresce white under ultraviolet light, indicating the presence of divaricatic acid and another unknown pigment. The cortex, or outer layer, contains usnic acid, which is commonly found in many lichen species and contributes to their colouration and protection from sunlight.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nRamalina azorica is found exclusively on the Azores islands of Pico, Terceira, Faial, and São Miguel. This species typically grows on coastal rocks and the lava of walls bordering coastal fields, where it occurs in local abundance.\n\n\n== References ==",

The vowels /ɪ/ and /ʏ/ (written ⟨i⟩ or ⟨y⟩ and ⟨u⟩ respectively) were lowered so that vinur (/ˈvɪːnʏr/, transl. friend) was pronounced /ˈvɛːnœr/ (as if written ⟨venör⟩) and skyr (/scɪːr/, a kind of yogurt) as /scɛːr/ (like ⟨sker⟩), while the vowels e and ö were raised such that spölur  (/spœːlʏr/, transl. a short distance) sounded like /spʏːlʏr/ (as if ⟨spulur⟩) and melur (/ˈmɛːlʏr/, transl. a gravel patch) as /ˈmɪːlʏr/ (as if ⟨milur⟩).This sound change was thought to be very ugly and called hljóðvilla (transl. sound lapse). It was prominent from 1940 in the speech of people from the Southwest and the Eastfjords, but also in the North and in Húnavatnssýsla. A special campaign was carried out during 1940–1960 in primary schools to eliminate flámæli. RÚV and Þjóðleikhúsið enforced a policy that the so-called phonological error would not be allowed. In 1929 42% of children in Reykjavík spoke with flámæli but by 1960 it had been eradicated among children.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDialect\nLinguistic purism\nSound change\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia rectiloba is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south of Western Australia. It is a spreading, compact shrub with hairy young branchlets, sharply-pointed egg-shaped leaves, and cream-coloured, tube-shaped flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia rectiloba is a spreading, compact shrub with hairy young branchlets, that typically grows to up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high and wide. Its leaves are egg-shaped, 6–11 mm (0.24–0.43 in) long, 2.5–3.5 mm (0.098–0.138 in) wide and sharply pointed, on a petiole 0.5–1.0 mm (0.020–0.039 in) long. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to 4 in leaf axils and are erect and sessile with egg-shaped bracts 0.7–1.2 mm (0.028–0.047 in) long and bracteoles 1.8–2.5 mm (0.071–0.098 in) long and 1.4–1.6 mm (0.055–0.063 in) wide. The sepals are narrowly egg-shaped, 3.8–4.5 mm (0.15–0.18 in) long and 1.4–1.7 mm (0.055–0.067 in) wide and greenish at first, later brown. The petals are cream-coloured and joined at the base to form a tube 3.4–4.2 mm (0.13–0.17 in) long and 1.3–1.6 mm (0.051–0.063 in) wide, with lobes that are turned back and 2.4–3.2 mm (0.094–0.126 in) long. Flowering has been observed between December and June, and the fruit is about 3.0–4.0 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nStyphelia rectiloba was first formally described in 2019 by Michael Hislop in the journal Nuytsia from specimens he collected near Kambalda in 2013. The specific epithet (rectiloba) means \"straight lobes\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis styphelia is only known from a few populations near Kambalda where it grows in open woodland or heath in rocky soils on or near granite breakaways in the Coolgardie bioregion of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia rectiloba is listed as \"Priority Three\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Archibald Campbell (; April 4, 1833 – February 13, 1899) was a lawyer, abolitionist, journalist, and member of the nascent Republican Party. He was born in Ohio in 1833 and raised in the western portion of Virginia. He met future Secretary of State, William H. Seward while studying law in New York. Influenced by Seward, Campbell joined the Republican Party. He bought the Wheeling Daily Intelligencer in 1856 and endeavored to expand its influence in Virginia. Campbell used the influence of his newspaper to advocate for the creation of West Virginia against the backdrop of the Civil War.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn on April 4, 1833, in Jefferson County, Ohio, Campbell's parents were Archibald W. Campbell and Phebe Clapp. His father's older brother was the influential Christian reformer, Alexander Campbell. Young Archibald grew up in the vicinity of Bethany, Virginia where his family had moved and where his uncle had started Bethany College, while his father served the community as a physician. Graduating from Bethany College in 1852, he subsequently studied law in New York at Hamilton College, receiving his law degree in 1855. There he met William H. Seward, and under his influence joined the newly formed Republican Party and took up the abolitionist cause.\n\n\n== Public life ==\nPartnering with John F. McDermot to buy the Wheeling Daily Intelligencer in 1856, Campbell assumed the role of the paper's editor in October of that year. He leveraged the paper's strong circulation over the next couple years to espouse his views against slavery.\nIn 1859, Campbell lobbied Republican Party leaders to hold its 1860 national convention in Wheeling, but was unsuccessful. At the convention which was held in Chicago, Campbell initially backed his mentor Seward in the latter's pursuit of the party's presidential nomination. With insufficient support for Seward within the party, Campbell subsequently endorsed the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\nCampbell viewed the policies of Virginia's state government as harmful to the residents of northwestern Virginia. When the Ordinance of Secession was adopted at the Convention of 1861, Campbell again turned to the power of the press by using his newspaper's popularity to promote the perceived benefits western Virginians might enjoy by establishing a new state. President Lincoln purportedly told West Virginia's Governor Pierpont that a timely letter written by Archibald Campbell had persuaded him to sign the bill that admitted West Virginia to the Union as a new state over the advice of his cabinet. Campbell also used his influence to champion the abolition of slavery as a provision in the first constitution of West Virginia.\nDuring and after the Civil War, Campbell viewed himself as a staunch Republican. But that allegiance was tested when he felt Party interests did not align with what he felt was best for West Virginia. By 1880, his vocal disagreements with party leaders on several issues had nearly resulted in his expulsion from the national convention. Despite the threat, he was able to lend his support to his friend, James A. Garfield's presidential nomination. After his election, President Garfield selected Campbell to serve as ambassador to China, but was killed before the supporting paperwork was finalized. Campbell, himself, appears to have been content to avoid seeking public office or government appointment.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCampbell married Annie W. Crawford in Wheeling, West Virginia, on March 10, 1864. Annie subsequently gave birth to a son and later, a daughter. After Annie later died, Campbell took a second wife named Mary H., whose surname is unknown. One daughter is known to have been born to the couple.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nCampbell gradually withdrew from his day-to-day editing and publishing responsibilities at the Intelligencer to allocate more time to other business pursuits and personal interests. He suffered a stroke and died on February 13, 1899, while visiting his sister in Missouri. He is interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Wheeling.\nCampbell was inducted into the Wheeling Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchibald W.

        "content": "The Grenada Monarchist League (GML) is an unincorporated nonprofit organisation in Grenada, promoting and educating on the Grenadian monarchy and Constitution. The organisation was founded on 7 February 2024, in response to increased pressures of republicanism among politicians in Grenada following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the country's Golden Jubilee of independence.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Grenada Monarchist League is an unincorporated nonprofit organisation. The organisation is independent and non-partisan, not being formally associated with any political party or other organisation. It has no paid staff, relying on volunteers to keep the group operating. The organisation is governed by a General Assembly consisting of all registered members of the league. An Executive Council comprising a chairman, deputy chairman, Head of Diaspora Affairs, and appointed Executive Councillors is tasked with the day-to-day operations of the organisation. The chairman, deputy chairman and Head of Diaspora Affairs are elected by the General Assembly, while Executive Councillors are appointed by the chairman, but may be removed by the General Assembly.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Oath of Allegiance debate ===\nAhead of the Golden Jubilee of Grenadian Independence in February 2024, proposals to amend the Grenadian oath of allegiance was proposed by a number of Grenadian lawyers. The proposed changes would have entailed the removal of references to the monarch from the oath, without the holding of a referendum. A similar proposal had previously been defeated by 56.7% of voters at the 2016 Grenadian constitutional referendum.\nThe Grenada Monarchist League's first public actions following its establishment entailed a public campaign against the proposed changes to the oath. The league condemned suggestions that the oath, as it stood, was to the “British monarch” and that it represented a lack of sovereignty and subordination to the United Kingdom. It accused prominent proponents of the change of spreading misinformation about the oath and the monarchy, and called on the government to drop any potential plans to amend the constitution. The league further campaigned by directly contacting Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell and all the members of the House of Representatives, encouraging its members to do the same.\n\n\n=== Reforming appointment process of the Governor-General ===\nA prominent objective of the league is the reform of the appointment process of the Governor-General, who is currently appointed by the King on the advice of the Grenadian Prime Minister. The league has proposed the establishment of a Privy Council for Grenada, which is to act as the body to advise the King on vice-regal appointments, as well as act as advisors to the Governor-General.For the purposes of this proposed reform, the league presented to the government a legislative proposal, the Privy Council (Establishment) Bill, in March 2024. The bill would establish a \"Privy Council for Grenada to act as a body to advise His Majesty and the Governor-General\". The proposed body would advise on vice-regal appointments by unanimous consent, and would consist of the Prime Minister, Leader of His Majesty's Opposition, the Minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, the Chair of the Public Service Commission, a judge, and 2 members appointed by the Governor-General.\nThe proposal faced some criticism on the basis that it was unnecessary given the ceremonial status of the Governor-General. The league reiterated its calls on the government to implement the proposed bill, pointing to the important constitutional roles vested in the Governor-General, which give it important powers far beyond ceremonial duties.\n\n\n=== Education campaign ===\nOther activities include educating and spreading awareness of the constitutional and ceremonial roles of the monarchy in Grenada, and dispelling misconceptions about its position. In particular, the group objects to referring to the monarchy in regards to Grenada as the “British monarchy”, pointing to its formal independent status under the Statute of Westminster as the “Grenadian monarchy”The league maintains an extensive overview of the monarchy's historic and political relationship with Grenada, seeking to educate Grenadians about why the monarchy matters and how it impacts governance.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nThe organisation has an undisclosed number of full and honorary members. Full membership is open and free to all Grenadians both resident in the country and in the diaspora, while non-Grenadians are accepted as honorary members.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonarchy of Grenada\nGovernor-General of Grenada\nConstitutional monarchy\n2016 Grenadian constitutional referendum\n2018 Grenadian constitutional referendum\nCommonwealth realms\nStatute of Westminster\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Heidelberg Codex, also known as Codex Heidelbergensis 921, Heidelbergensis 921, or Codex Palatinus Latinus 921, is a parchment codex dated to the 8th–9th century, containing a copy of the works of Jordanes: Romana and Getica, which was destroyed in a fire on the night of July 15–16, 1880.\n\n\n== Physical description ==\nOriginally, this codex consisted of 15 quaternions, totaling 120 leaves. According to the inventory of Heidelberg codices after the Congress of Vienna in 1816, it contained only 110 leaves, or 220 pages of variously described formats: folio, quadratae maioris, or large quarto. The entire first gathering was missing, and the last one had only 6 leaves. According to the description by Theodor Mommsen from 1882, 110 leaves were written on, the first two leaves and the last one (i.e., 1, 2, and 112) were blank, and the foliation resulted from duplicating leaf 17.This manuscript is identified under the signature of the library in the Heidelberg University – Palat. Lat. 921. According to the systematics of Codices Latini Antiquiores, in which it was described in Part VIII, it is numbered as 1224.No facsimile of any fragment of this manuscript has survived. There is only an illustration of a copy of a fragment of the text of the Romana (part of caput 215) included in Friedrich Wilken's catalog from 1817, which Wilken described in the appendix to his Geschichte der Bildung, Beraubung und Vernichtung der alten Heidelbergischen Büchersammlungen from 1817, and Theodor Mommsen in the introduction to the edition of Jordanes' works from 1882. The description was also included in Part VIII of Codices Latini Antiquiores from 1959.\n\n\n== Dating, place of origin and handwriting ductus ==\nThe writing of this codex is dated respectively: rather to the 8th than to the 9th century, to the 8th–9th century, or to the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries. The place of origin is considered to be Germany, in one of the scriptoria in the area of Mainz or (which cannot be proven) perhaps in the Princely Abbey of Fulda, from where it would likely have made its way to Mainz, probably through the agency of Marianus Scotus. German provenance is inferred from an interlinear gloss in Old High German: the word suagur (English: brother-in-law) written next to the Latin cognatus in the Romana (c. 337).The codex was written in Insular minuscule, in a style used on the European continent. This script was characterized mainly by the large descenders of minuscule letters, including the letters r and s. The letter a is often unclosed, and i is slightly larger. Corrections to grammar were made in the codex during the Middle Ages, but not very heavily, so the original script is still visible in most places.\n\n\n== Content and meaning ==\nThe codex contained two works by Jordanes: the Romana and the Getica. Already in the early 19th century, there were missing pages containing the beginning of the Romana (up to the last words of caput 56 – the text begins with the words et finis) and the end of the Getica (the ending of caput 299 is missing – the text breaks off at the word regi – and the following 17 capita). The beginning of the Getica text was located on page 51.Mommsen considered the transmission of the codex to be the best among those known to him, although the text of this manuscript rarely spoke against others. He classified it as belonging to the first class of transmissions, in which it was the best. In the codex copy of Jordanes, a few words were omitted in two places in the Getica: part of caput 200 (fide et consilio ut diximus clarus) and part of 222 (obicientes exemplo veriti regis), and there were few errors (fourteen in total) where other manuscripts of this group transmit the correct script.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first definite information about the whereabouts of the manuscript is an ownership note from the year 1479 of the cathedral library in Mainz. This note was entered on the first leaf and read: iste liber pertinet ad librariam sancti Martini ecclesie Maguntin. M(acarius) Sindicus s(ub)s(cripsi)t 1479, which translates to this codex belongs to the library of the church of St. Martin in Mainz. M[akarius von Buseck], syndic, wrote [this] in 1479. Additionally, the volume was described with the following note: 1651 – 646566{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {646}{566}}} – h 13. Then the codex became part of the collection of the Bibliotheca Palatina in Heidelberg, where it was used by Jan Gruter. In 1622, along with the rest of the collection, the codex was in Rome, where it remained until the Napoleonic Wars. It was then transported to Paris, from where, as a result of the Vienna Congress agreements, it returned to Heidelberg. The manuscript, along with three other manuscripts (also containing texts of Jordanes' works), burned in the fire at the house of Theodor Mommsen, publisher of the Romana and Getica in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica series, on the night of July 15–16, 1880, in Charlottenburg.\n\n\n=== Lausanne fragment (Ms. 398) ===\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Marius Besson discovered a fragment of one leaf of an old medieval manuscript at the Musée historiographie vaudoise. This fragment was transferred to the Cantonal and University Library in Lausanne and was assigned the signature Ms. 398, under which it is currently known. On both sides of the leaf, there are fragments of Chapter 60 of Jordanes' Getica written in Anglo-Saxon minuscule, which is why Besson considered this fragment to be one of the lost leaves of the Heidelberg Codex. However, this attribution was negated in the entry in the Codices Latini Antiquiores due to differences in the writing styles. Additionally, a meticulous comparative analysis of the script from the Lausanne relic by Sandra Bertelli with the fragment from Wilken's catalogue excluded the possibility of identifying the creators of both inscriptions. Given the impossibility of determining the number of copyists working on the Heidelberg Codex, any further conclusions are impossible to draw.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBertelli, S.

        "content": "Teloschistes spinosus is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), fruticose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It is found in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe lichen was first formally described by the botanists Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Taylor in 1844, from specimens collected in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), Australia. They initially classified it in the genus Parmelia. Gustaf Einar Du Rietz suggested its inclusion in the genus Xanthoria in 1922. James Murray transferred it to Teloschistes in 1960. He recorded its presence on New Zealand's South Island, but suggested it might be \"very local\", as it had not been recorded in several other similar locales.\nRex Filson proposed the varietysubteres in 1969. This variety, identified in Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales, differs from the typical form of the species in having larger, clearly almost cylindrical lobes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTeloschistes spinosus has a thallus that ranges in colour from yellow to orange-yellow. Initially, it appears as small scales on twigs but eventually forms small, cushion-like clusters up to 3 cm in diameter and 2–5 mm high. The thallus has numerous slender, star-shaped lobes that are typically 1–3 mm long, occasionally reaching up to 5 mm. These lobes are narrow, about 0.3–0.8 mm wide, and relatively thin, with a thickness of 0.1–0.15 mm. They are sparsely branched and range from flat to slightly curved upward (caniculate) on top, while being loosely attached (adnate) to the substrate or sometimes standing upright. These lobes are adorned with scattered, hair-like extensions (fibrils) that are similar in colour to the thallus and measure 1–1.5 mm long, and there are also a few whitish root-like structures (rhizines) on the lower surface. This species does not produce soredia, which are granular clusters of cells used for vegetative reproduction.\nThe upper cortex of the thallus is fibrous, about 20–50 µm thick, composed of tightly packed 4 µm-thick fungal filaments (hyphae). Below this layer, the algal layer is irregularly distributed, containing cells of the green algal genus Trebouxia about 10–18 µm in diameter. The medulla, or innermost layer of the thallus, features loosely intertwined thin-walled hyphae about 3 µm in diameter. The lower cortex is up to 50 µm thick and is a mix of fibrous and more tightly packed (paraplectenchymatous) tissue.\nThe reproductive structures, or apothecia, initially form directly on the upper surface of the thallus and later raise on 2–4 mm long grooved stalks as the thallus thickens and becomes erect. These are 3–5 mm in diameter, flat or slightly convex, with a subtly wavy edge that gradually becomes indistinct. The disc of the apothecia is slightly darker than the thallus and has a matte finish. Below the disc, the hypothecium (the layer beneath the spore-producing hymenium) is obscurely cellular and measures 40–45 µm high. The hymenium itself is 65 µm high and mostly clear, except for an orange granular top layer (epithecium).\nThe spore-producing cells (asci) are 40 by 13 µm, with a thickened upper part. Spores are broadly ellipsoid, measuring 13–15 by 6–7.5 µm. Additionally, pycnidia—small fruiting bodies producing asexual spores—are semi-immersed near the margins of the lobes. They are spherical, 150 µm in diameter, orange, and produce cylindrical pycnidiospores that are 3 by 1 µm.\n\n\n== Species interactions ==\nArthonia anjutae is a lichenicolous fungus that has been recorded parasitising Teloschistes spinosus specimens collected in South Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mohammad Amin bin Haji Sisa (born 2 January 1998) is a Bruneian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Indera SC of the Brunei Super League and the Brunei national football team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nAmin attended Brunei's Sports School as a youngster. From 2015 to 2016, Amin was a squad member of the league team of the Brunei under-23s namely Tabuan Muda, and played with the likes of Abdul Khair Basri, Khairil Shahme Suhaimi and Shafie Effendy. He scored his first league goal in a 2–2 draw with Lun Bawang FC on 20 September 2015. He then moved to Kasuka FC in 2017, but failed to regularly hold a place in the star-studded team in 2018–19 that came second behind MS ABDB in the league table.\nAmin moved to Indera SC at the start of 2020, and made his competitive debut at the second leg of the 2020 AFC Cup qualifying round which was a 3–1 defeat to Yangon United in Yangon, Myanmar on 29 January. He then scored against his former club in his second league appearance in a 2–4 loss to Kasuka on 7 March. It would be the last round of the 2020 Brunei Super League as the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation days after, forcing the cancellation of the league.\nAmin played regularly throughout the following campaigns for Indera, contributing to his team's second-place finish in the 2023 Brunei Super League.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nAmin was a Brunei youth international from 2013 to 2019, his first tournament for the Young Wasps was the 2014 AFC U-16 Championship qualification round that was held in Laos in September 2013. Marking the start of Stephen Ng Heng Seng's coaching stint in Brunei, the Young Wasps cruised to a 4–1 victory over Guam in the first game with Amin starting the match. He made four appearances out of four games as Brunei finished fourth in the group.\nTwo years later, Amin was selected for the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship as part of Tabuan Muda in August of that year. He made four appearances for Brunei U19 in as many games, all ending in defeats.\nIn 2017, Amin was part of the Brunei under-23 squad that competed at the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualifying round held in Myanmar. After failing to appear in any of the games, he was axed from the squad for the 29th SEA Games the following month, making way for Yura Indera Putera Yunos.\nThe following year, Brunei hosted the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy for under-21 teams in Southeast Asia from April to May. Amin was selected to play for the host nation and took the field from the start in the matches against Timor-Leste and Thailand. Ultimately, Brunei failed to progress to the knockout stages after a 0–1 loss to Myanmar in their final group game where Amin was replaced by Nur Ikhmal Damit in the starting lineup.\nAmin was back in the Tabuan Muda fold in 2019, appearing for the under-23s at the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification matches held in Vietnam in March, followed by a long-awaited participation of the 30th SEA Games near the end of the year. He played a total of 5 games for Brunei U23.\n\n\n=== Senior ===\nAmin had his first callup to the senior national team at the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup held in Banda Aceh, Indonesia on 2–6 December. He made his unofficial debut for the Wasps as a last-minute substitute in a 4–0 loss to hosts Indonesia U23 in the first game.\nAmin's next involvement with the senior side was at the 2022 World Cup qualification, a two-legged affair with Mongolia in June 2019. He was not utilised by Robbie Servais as the Wasps were eliminated from the World Cup and also the 2023 Asian Cup 2–3 on aggregate.\nAfter having been selected for national team training camps in 2020, Amin subsequently missed out on representing Brunei at the 2022 AFF Mitsubishi Electric Cup and also the 2026 World Cup qualifying fixtures against Indonesia. He was then restored to the squad at the 2024 FIFA Series held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in March of that year where he finally gained his first international cap against Bermuda in a 2–0 defeat.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nKasuka FC\nBrunei Super League: 2018–19 (runners-up)\nIndera SC\nBrunei Super League: 2023 (runners-up)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmin Sisa at Soccerway\nAmin Sisa at WorldFootball.net",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The March on Rome of 88 BC was a coup d'état by the consul of the Roman Republic Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who seized power against his enemies Marius and Sulpicius that had previously ousted him from Rome. It was the first time in Roman history that a general ordered his army to march against the Republic.\nIn 88 BC, Sulla was elected consul and given the command of the war against the king of Pontus Mithridates, who had recently invaded the Roman province of Asia. The same year, Sulla and his colleague Quintus Pompeius Rufus opposed the attempt of the tribune of the plebs Publius Sulpicius to enrol the Italians who received the Roman citizenship at the end of the Social War (91–87 BC). To bypass the consuls' opposition, Sulpicius sought the support of the popular Gaius Marius, who had already been consul six times. Marius demanded for his help that Sulpicius pass a law transferring Sulla's command to him. Using armed gangs to intimidate the tribal assembly, Sulpicius removed Pompeius' consulship and forced Sulla to flee from Rome, after which he enrolled the Italians and gave the Mithridatic command to Marius.\nMeanwhile, Sulla had returned to the legions he had assembled for the expedition against Mithridates. He convinced his soldiers to follow him in an operation against Marius and Sulpicius. Joined by Pompeius, Sulla marched against Rome and easily defeated the militia recruited by his enemies. Sulla immediately passed a law declaring Sulpicius, Marius, and ten other leaders, as public enemies, therefore encouraging their murder. Only Sulpicius was caught, Marius and the others could escape to Africa and Spain. Once Rome secured, Sulla started an overhaul of the Roman constitution according to his firm conservative beliefs. He passed several laws that weakened the powers of the tribunes of the plebs, while enhancing those of the curule magistrates and the senate, whose membership was also doubled.\nSulla's settlement was nevertheless short-lived. First, his candidates lost the elections for 87 BC. Then, as soon as he left to fight Mithridates, his enemies coalesced around the consul for 87 BC Lucius Cornelius Cinna, who likewise marched on Rome against the other consul during the Bellum Octavianum. Cinna recalled the outlaws, including Marius, then cancelled all Sulla's laws and assumed Sulpicius' program. The inevitable confrontation between the two factions took place in 83 BC, when Sulla came back from the East, in a civil war, won by Sulla, who thereafter became dictator and re-enacted his previous laws.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSulla was an ambitious politician who had won fame by making several bold military moves, such as the capture of Jugurtha during the Jugurthine War and the battle of Vercellae of during the Cimbrian War. He was elected praetor in 97, then left as propraetor to Cappadocia to put Ariobarzanes on the throne of that kingdom. On his return, he was accused of corruption by Gaius Marcius Censorinus, perhaps acting on behalf of Gaius Marius, his former commander. Sulla then disappears from the sources for 5 years, perhaps because he thought he had no chance to become consul. He is found again in 90 as a legate during the Social War, against Rome's former Italian allies. This war was difficult for Rome, who needed up to fifteen legions in Italy to quell the revolt. Fighting on the southern theatre, Sulla was one of the two main generals who won the war, earning the devotion of his army. His ability was recognised by the Caecilii Metelli, one of the dominant families of the time, who sealed an alliance with his marriage to Caecilia Metella. This powerful backing, combined with his military fame, enabled his election to the consulship in December 89 for the following year (88). The other consul was also his friend Quintus Pompeius Rufus, who married his son with Sulla's daughter.\nAfter entering office, Sulla was granted the command of the war against the king of Pontus Mithridates, who had taken advantage of the Social War to capture Roman possessions in the Greek East. An eastern command was coveted by every Roman politician, because of the enormous booty it would bring them. This command looked so attractive that two ineligible candidates had even tried to force their way through in the elections: Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo and Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo.\nSulla faced another challenge from Publius Sulpicius, a tribune of the plebs the same year as him. Sulpicius wanted to pass a law in favour of the Italians who had received the citizenship in 90 thanks to the lex Julia, but had not yet been registered in the Roman tribes. His bill distributed the Italians, as well as freedmen, evenly among the Roman tribes, a move which would have considerably altered the Roman electorate. A powerful orator and ambitious politician, Sulpicius was initially a friend of the consul Pompeius Rufus and had decisively prevented Caesar Strabo from running against Sulla, maybe to attract the latter's goodwill so he would not challenge his Italian bill. Sulpicius was however wrong; both consuls opposed his bill distributing the new Italian citizens in the old Roman tribes (Sulla and the conservatives would have rather gathered the Italians into a few tribes, so that old citizens would have kept a majority of the tribes). Not willing to give up his plan, Sulpicius then turned to Marius for support. Like the other main politicians of the period, the old general, six times consul and very influential among the equites and Italian gentry, wanted the command against Mithridates, and also to settle some old grudges against Sulla. In exchange for supporting the Italian bill, Marius requested Sulpicius to pass a law transferring the Eastern command from Sulla to him. This alliance probably took place in April–May 88.\nSulpicius assembled a large bodyguard of 600 equites and a private army of 3,000 men, probably to avoid the same fate as previous revolutionary tribunes—such as the Gracchi and Saturninus—and to intimidate voters. The consuls Sulla and Rufus ordered a suspension of business (justitium) to prevent Sulpicius' Italian bill from being voted. In return, Sulpicius provoked a riot with his gangs that killed Pompeius' son and forced Sulla to seek shelter into the house of Marius, who apparently negotiated his survival on the condition that he cancelled the justitium, which would let the Italian bill pass. Marius also allowed Sulla to leave Rome in order to finish the siege of Nola in Campania, one of the last pockets of resistance of the Social War. Sulpicius then passed the Italian bill, as well as the deposition of Pompeius Rufus, and the bill giving Marius the Eastern command, which had been kept secret so far. These bills broke many constitutional practices; the most outstanding one was the transfer of the eastern command from a consul to a privatus (Marius), a citizen that did not hold any magistracy—an unprecedented occurrence.\n\n\n== March on Rome ==\n\nSulla learnt he lost the Eastern command at Nola. He had to react against Sulpicius and Marius if he wanted to save his career. Because of the Social War, he was in the unusual position to have a massive experienced army at his disposal not far from Rome. Sulla was already popular among his soldiers, since he had received from them the grass crown during the Social War the previous year. Ernst Badian even speaks of Sulla's legions as his \"private client army\". Apparently, Sulla did not present his intentions to his soldiers; he skilfully let them take the decision to march on Rome by themselves. He told his troops that if Marius was appointed, he would recruit a new army to fight Mithridates, which means that the soldiers in Sulla's army would too lose their share of the Eastern booty. Since his soldiers were mostly landless and in need of cash, this argument secured their support for a coup. Sulla likely presented his march as a legitimate police operation of the consuls against a tribune of the plebs who usurped his rights. The decision to march on Rome became unavoidable when the soldiers stoned to death the military tribunes that Marius had send to take over his army, as well as the legate Marcus Gratidius, a relative of Marius. This event showed that the soldiers only recognised Sulla as their leader and did not hesitate to use violence against his enemies. However, Sulla's plan was firmly opposed by all the officers of his staff but one, identified by modern scholars as Lucullus, who was at the time quaestor, and Sulla's closest political ally for the remaining of his life. Sulla notably dedicated his memoirs to him. The other consul Pompeius Rufus also joined Sulla a bit later; he too had been deprived of his position by Sulpicius. In his Memoirs, Sulla mentioned a significant number of portents that intervened in his decision to attack Rome, such as a haruspex named Postumius who predicted his victory and a dream Sulla had in which the goddess Bellona appeared to him striking his enemies. This dream later became a central element of Sulla's propaganda. In 44 BC, one of his descendants, Lucius Aemilius Buca, minted a denarius that has been interpreted by some numismatists as a depiction of Sulla's dream.\nThe march began in August, soon after the murder of Gratidius and the tribunes, with the two consuls at the head of the six legions that had been encamped in Campania, so at least 36,000 veterans. Sulla's move on the city was overwhelmingly rejected at Rome. Under the control of Marius and Sulpicius, the senate dispatched an embassy, which counted the praetors Marcus Junius Brutus (a known supporter of Marius) and a Servilius, to ask why Sulla was marching against his fatherland, to which he replied that was going to free Rome from the tyrants, a rhetoric used by the assassins of the Gracchi. Thereafter his soldiers mistreated the embassy by breaking the praetors' fasces and tearing their togae, the symbols of their authority. Marius and Sulpicius had never expected Sulla to use his legions to attack them in Rome. As a result, Rome had no troops to defend itself against Sulla's army. Marius tried to gain some time to organise the defence by sending two other embassies, in front of whom Sulla faked a halt of his march. While he was pretending to build a camp, he had dispatched two of his military tribunes, Lucius Minucius Basilus and Gaius Mummius, with the cavalry and some light troops to seize the Esquiline Gate, on the eastern wall of Rome. As soon as the senatorial legation left, he resumed his march.\n\nSulla's plan to capture Rome was to send Pompeius Rufus with one legion through the Colline Gate, the most northern gate. Two legions were ordered to take the Caelimontana gate in the south-east and the Pons Sublicius in the south-west. One legion was left in reserve while Sulla himself with two legions entered through the Esquiline Gate, where he met with his legates Basilus and Mummius. As Marius knew that he could not win the fight against Sulla's overwhelming forces, his plan was to force Sulla's legions into a difficult street fight, so that his soldiers would have second thoughts about the sacrilege they were committing. The defenders climbed on the roofs and threw tiles on Sulla's soldiers on ground level. Sulla set the houses on fire to clear the roofs, then ordered the reserve legion to go through the Viminalis gate (between the Colline and Esquiline gates) to take Suburra, the large neighbourhood in the centre of Rome. Seeing that Sulla's legions were moving behind their back, Marius and Sulpicius retreated to the Oppian Hill and the Temple of Tellus, where they promised the local slaves freedom if they fought for them. As no slave followed them, Marius, Sulpicius, and the other leaders opposed to Sulla had no choice but to flee during the night.\nSulla ensured that his legions remained under control by executing a few soldiers who had looted some houses, then spread his troops over the city for the night to maintain order. Both consuls stayed awake throughout the night to keep an eye on their soldiers. Sulla wanted to send the message to the population that he had come to free the city, not to conquer it.\n\n\n== The twelve hostes ==\nThe next day, the consuls called the senate to have Marius and Sulpicius outlawed in order to justify the march. Quintus Mucius Scaevola, consul in 117 and a distinguished jurist, was the only senator to speak against Sulla; he was a friend of Marius and his granddaughter Licinia was married to Marius' son.  As nobody else dared to oppose Sulla, the senate approved a list of twelve people who were declared hostes, \"foreign enemies\", another constitutional precedent. It means that they could be killed without consequences and their properties seized. The senatus consultum was followed by a law condemning the hostes. The word hostis meant public enemy in Sulla's time, but its original meaning in Old Latin was foreigner. Therefore, Sulla employed this word to associate Marius and his followers with foreign enemies, in order to justify his use of Roman legions against Rome, as they were normally only employed against foreign armies. The official reasons given by Sulla for condemning the hostes was the troubles caused by gangs of Sulpicius, his violence against the consuls, and Marius' and Sulpicius' promise of manumission to the slaves during the fight against Sulla.\nImmediately after the senatorial vote, Sulla sent his cavalry and bounty hunters to pursue the twelve hostes.  The most complete list of these twelve hostes is found in the book on the civil wars written by Appian, a Greek historian of the 2nd century AD, who gives nine names, while Cicero tells the name of another.\n\nPublius Sulpicius, was still tribune of the plebs when declared hostis. He was the only one of the twelve hostes to be killed.\nGaius Marius, was six time consuls at the time. He was captured, but his vast auctoritas allowed his escape to Africa, where many of his veterans lived.\nGaius Marius minor closely followed his father despite his young age (he was only 22 in 88). He went with him to Africa.\nPublius Cornelius Cethegus was the only patrician of the list; he fled with Marius to Africa. However, he later joined Sulla's side during the civil war and enriched himself thanks to Sulla's proscription. His new wealth made him a very influential senator in the 70s.\nMarcus Junius Brutus was praetor in 88 and in the first embassy sent by the senate to meet Sulla during the March. He fled to Spain, where his family had influence, and was proscribed in 82, after which he committed suicide. He is not the same as the homonymous father of Caesar's assassin.\nGnaeus Papirius Carbo. Only his praenomen survives in Appian's manuscript, which has been corrupted into \"Gnaeus Granius\", as a brother of the following entry in the list. Carbo later became consul and one of the main leaders against Sulla during the civil war from 83 to 82. He was proscribed in 82 and murdered by Pompey.\nQuintus Granius. He is generally regarded as a relative of Marius, likely as a child of Julia before her marriage to him, which would mean that Granius was a wealthy man, because his father was able to marry a patrician woman. The possibility also exists that Granius was a bastard son of Marius before his marriage to Julia. He fled with Marius to Africa and was perhaps proscribed in 82.\nPublius Albinovanus, perhaps tribune of the plebs in 88 alongside Sulpicius, he resisted with arms Sulla's entry into Rome. He was from Etruria and a client of Marius. Like Cethegus, he fled to Africa with Marius, but betrayed his faction for Sulla during the civil war.\nMarcus Laetorius is not really known. A member of the family was a radical supporter of Gaius Gracchus in 121 and another was proscribed in 82.\nQuintus Rubrius Varro, the only name given by Cicero. He was probably an delator, the son of a tribune of the plebs in 123 alongside Gaius Gracchus, and may have been related by blood to Gnaeus Papirius Carbo.\nGaius Marcius Censorinus is not mentioned in ancient sources, but he was a likely victim of Sulla, whom he had prosecuted in 95. He was an extreme supporter of Marius in 87, even beheading the consul Gnaeus Octavius. He was in turn beheaded by Sulla after the battle of the Colline Gate in 82. He was also a triumvir monetalis in 88.\nServilius, the praetor who tried to stop Sulla's march together with Brutus is another possible victim.\nOnly Sulpicius was caught after a slave betrayed him. He was killed and beheaded; his head displayed on the rostra in the Forum.  The other hostes mostly followed Marius in his escape to Africa, or went to Spain, like Brutus.\n\n\n== Reforms ==\nAll the legislation passed by Sulpicius after the Consuls' declaration of the suspension of business was annulled; Sulla was therefore given his command back and Pompeius his consulship, whereas the Italian bill of Sulpicius was also cancelled.\nSulla did not stop at destroying his enemies. He took advantage of his strong position to force significant constitutional reforms, so he would not be similarly relieved from his command while fighting Mithridates. He could also fix the problems he saw in the prevalent power structure of the Republic, even though these changes were made by the force of arms for the first time in its history. He first established the supremacy of the senate over the legislative process, by forcing new bills to be approved by the Senate before being proposed to voters. Sulla was therefore returning to the situation before the lex Hortensia of 287, when the tribunes had to get the authorisation of the senate to carry a bill before the tribal assembly.\nSulla next granted legislative power to the centuriate assembly, where citizens were distributed in classes based on wealth, thus becoming the only assembly that could vote laws. Laws had so far been voted in the tribal assembly, where citizens were organised by tribe, which therefore only retained the function to elect lower magistrates. Interestingly, this reform would have enrolled wealthy Italians into the first centuries, who could therefore yield more influence through their vote in the centuriate assembly that in the tribal assembly. An arrangement that suited Sulla, who had some friends among the Italian nobility. Modern historians have variously interpreted the confused statement by Appian, who did not understand the legislative process of the Roman Republic. Kaj Sandberg suggests that Sulla actually gave the power to consuls and praetors to introduce bills before the tribal assembly, whereas they hitherto could only do so before the centuriate assembly, on matters of war and peace. He adds that this \"was one of the most radical changes of political practice ever undertaken in the republican period\". These reforms were designed to prevent revolutionary tribunes of the plebs, such as the Gracchi, Saturninus, or more recently Sulpicius, from emerging again.\nIn order to increase his support in the Senate, Sulla intended to appoint 300 new senators, but probably never implemented this measure. Similarly, he planned to found 12 colonies for the veterans of the Social War, which would have further increased his popularity among soldiers. Sulla finally passed a law cancelling 10% of all debts and fixed a maximum interest rate for future debts, as the capture by Mithridates of Asia, combined with the devastation of the Social War, had triggered a severe economic crisis in Rome. All his reforms were unopposed, thanks to the threatening presence of his faithful soldiers in the city.\nDespite the tremendous changes that Sulla made to the Roman constitution, he presented them as restoration of ancestral customs instead of innovations. The swiftness with which Sulla passed several complex laws in quick succession just after having taking Rome shows that there was no improvisation; he had devised his political program for a while and took advantage of his control of the institutions to enforce it. Several scholars have nevertheless doubted that some of these reforms took place in 88, because they are very similar to those Sulla passed during his dictatorship in 82–80. As these reforms are only described by Appian, who was prone to mistakes, modern historians think they are a duplicate of Sulla's reforms of 82.\n\n\n== Elections for 87 BC ==\nAfter the coup, Sulla sent his army back to its encampment in Campania. Before leaving to the East, he attempted to influence the elections for 87. However, without his army to scare his opponents, several candidates could speak freely against him, and even support an amnesty of the hostes still alive; the results were thus not in his favour. Voters in the tribes were perhaps shocked by Sulla's coup, the murder of Sulpicius—who was still a sacrosanct tribune of the plebs—and the action against Marius, a popular hero since the Cimbrian War. For example, Sulla's nephew, Sextus Nonius Sufenas, was defeated for the aedileship, whereas a relative of Marius and the murdered legate Gratidius, Marcus Marius Gratidianus, was elected tribune of the plebs at the end of September. The other new tribunes were in majority hostile to Sulla, who nonetheless managed to prevent his enemy Quintus Sertorius from being elected. Two tribunes are known to have been on Sulla's side: Sextus Lucilius and Publius Magius, the latter being Italian.\nThe consular elections were held in the centuriate assembly after those of the tribunes and other lesser magistrates. Sulla's favourite candidate for the consulship, Publius Servilius Vatia, also lost, even though he had arranged a triumph for him on 21 October 88 in order to boost his popularity. The two new consuls were Gnaeus Octavius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna. It seems that both consuls were elected because they were not close to either Sulla or Marius and Sulpicius and favoured the status quo. The wealthy voters who dominated the centuriate assembly were against both Sulpicius' mass enrolment of new Italian citizens and Sulla's coup, even though his reforms benefited them. Ernst Badian writes that \"at this time Sulla was the leader of a mercenary army of have-nots: a phenomenon unwelcome to those classes\". Octavius was a man without military experience and, according to Cicero, not a good speaker. However, he was a harsh conservative from a family with distinguished records of resisting popular agitation—he personally fought Saturninus in his youth—which made his election possible in the political context of 88. Cinna's background is not well-known. Keaveney says he possibly made a campaign against Sulla, while Barry Katz tells that Cinna was at the time from a more conservative background, with ancestors and relatives hostile to the Gracchi. Before proclaiming the electoral results valid (a procedure known as renuntiatio), Sulla obtained the oath from his successors that they would uphold his legislation. This oath had perhaps been required by a law of Sulla, approved by the senate and voted by the centuriate assembly because it enshrined the political and social status quo.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe situation quickly worsened for Sulla after the end of his consulship. In order to retain his control of the government once away to fight Mithridates, he made Pompeius proconsul in replacement of Pompeius Strabo, who had remained neutral during Sulla's march, but was still at the head of the other main army in Italy. Sulla's plan was therefore to remove this potentially dangerous rival and make Pompeius the guardian of his work. However, Pompeius Strabo ordered his soldiers to murder Pompeius Rufus when he arrived in his camp. Meanwhile, the tribune of the plebs Marcus Vergilius sued Sulla, on the order of Cinna, probably for having killed Sulpicius. His goal was perhaps to convict Sulla and therefore strip him of his command, but the move was illegal as a magistrate holding imperium had immunity. Sulla ignored the prosecution and left to the East with his legions.\nIn Sulla's absence, Cinna relaunched Sulpicius' policy in favour of the Italians, which was opposed by the other consul, Octavius. After a riot, Cinna was expelled from Rome and stripped of his consulship. Cinna then followed Sulla's example; he gathered troops still present in Italy and, appealing to the men to vindicate his consular status, marched on Rome with the help of Marius, who had returned from Africa. In the subsequent confrontation, known as the Bellum Octavianum, the other consul Octavius could only rely on the troops of Pompeius Strabo, but the latter died in a plague, which enabled Cinna and Marius to capture the city. Like Sulla before, they murdered their opponents and declared Sulla hostis, while cancelling his laws. The situation remained in a standstill, with Cinna in control of Rome and Sulla in the East for three years, until Cinna died in 84. Sulla returned from Greece in 83; his experienced legions swept away the levies of Cinna's followers and he captured Rome a second time. Like in 88, he targeted his enemies in extrajudicial murders, but this time in a much wider proscription. He was then appointed dictator, so he could restore the constitutional program he had passed in 88.\nModern scholars severely judge Sulla's decision to march on Rome. They insist on the novelty of Sulla's march, which destroyed the previous aristocratic system of governance, and the dangerous precedent he set for strong and unscrupulous generals. Christopher Mackay writes that \"at this point, Sulla took a step that would seal the fate of the Republic, even though it would continue to function (more or less) for another four decades\". C. F. Konrad says that \"For the res publica of the nobles, it signaled the beginning of the end\"., a view followed by Harriet Flower, \"Sulla's decision to march on Rome with the army... was a devastating choice that led to the complete collapse of the traditional republican culture of the nobiles\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnnie Allély, \"La déclaration d'hostis de 88 et les douze hostes\", Revue des Études Anciennes, 2007, 109–1, pp. 175–206.\nErnst Badian, Foreign Clientelae (264–70 B.C.), Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1958.\n——, Studies in Greek and Roman History, Oxford, Blackwell, 1964.\n——, Lucius Sulla, the Deadly Reformer, Sidney, University of Sidney Press, 1970.

It is endemic to Vietnam and possibly nearby parts of Laos.\nScientists observed this frog in karst forest. People have seen this frog between 1000 and 1200 meters above sea level.\nThe adult male frog measures 32.2–33.1 mm in snout-vent length and the adult female frog 37.6–39.3 mm. There is more webbed skin on the hind feet than on the front feet. The skin of the dorsum is moss-green in color. There is a green mark in the shape of the letter Y on the back.\nScientists named this frog for Doctor Truong Quang Nguyen, a scientist from the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology's Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources who has contributed to the study of amphibians in this part of southeast Asia.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was the first National Assembly whose members were elected by the people.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29, the Russian and Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Adrianople in September 1829. One element of this was the granting of autonomy to the Ottoman-controlled Principality of Serbia.\nOn 15 and 17 November Prince Miloš issued an order to carry out elections for Grand National Assembly that would convene in Kragujevac on 24 January 1830.The elections were held in each nahiyah on different days, with the local Nahi elders determining the electoral date.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe new Assembly convened on the morning of 24 January and was held in an open field next to the church in Kragujevac. Miloš read out the hatt-i humayun of 1829, which confirmed the outcome of the Treaty of Adrianople and the establishment of Serbian autonomy. It remained in session until 28 January.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Janet Tate is a condensed-matter physicist and materials scientist whose research is centered on transparent semiconductors and their application in the design of electroluminescent devices, solar cells, and thin film electronics. Originally from South Africa, and educated in South Africa and the US, she has worked in Germany and the US, where she is University Distinguished Professor of Physics at Oregon State University.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nTate studied physics and chemistry at the University of Natal in South Africa, earning a bachelor's degree in 1980 and honors in physics in 1981. She came to Stanford University in 1982 as a Fulbright Scholar, earned a master's degree in physics in 1984, and completed her Ph.D. in 1988 under the supervision of Blas Cabrera Navarro. Her doctoral research, initially intended as a calibration check for the Gravity Probe B experiment, found an anomalously large mass for Cooper pairs of electrons in a rotating superconductor, sparking subsequent interest in gravitoelectromagnetism.Next, with the support of a Humboldt Fellowship, she became a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich, working there with Helmut Kinder on high-temperature superconductivity. She joined Oregon State University as an assistant professor of physics in 1989, and was tenured as an associate professor in 1994. In 2002, she was promoted to full professor, and took a second courtesy appointment as a professor of chemistry. She was named a distinguished professor in 2018.\n\n\n== Textbook ==\nTate is the coauthor of the physics textbook Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms Approach (Pearson, 2012, with David H. McIntyre and Corinne Manogue).\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nTate was named as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2015, after a nomination from the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics, \"for contributions to structural, transport, and optical properties of a wide variety of electronic and superconducting materials\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nJanet Tate publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "Lupu (Chinese: 芦浦镇) is a town under the jurisdiction of Yuhuan County, Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China.\n\n\n== History ==\nLupu Town is located at the northern end of Yuhuan Island, adjacent to Leqing Bay, and facing Yandang Mountain across the sea. Lupu was originally a strait with reeds growing along the shore. There is a mountain ridge to the south called Luao (芦岙), and in the southeast part of the intertidal zone, there is a large inlet called Shenpu (深浦 or Chenpu 琛浦). \nIn the sixth year of the Qing Yongzheng reign (1728), when Yuhuan Hall (玉环厅) was established, there were Luao Village (芦岙村) and Chenpu Village (琛浦村). In the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), they were renamed Luao Township (芦岙乡) and Shapu Township (沙浦乡). In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), they were collectively called Lupu Township (芦浦乡). After the founding of the People's Republic of China, a salt special zone was established, which administered Luao Township, Shenpu Township, etc. In 1956, Luao Township, Jingtou Township, and Shenpu Township were merged, and the name Lupu, taking one character each from Luao and Shenpu, was adopted, later changed to Lupu Commune (芦浦公社). In 1984, Lupu Township was re-established. In 1994, it was changed to Lupu Town.\n\n\n== Administrative division ==\nLupu Town administers the following village-level administrative units:Xuanmen Village, Daotou Village, Geling Village, Xiaotangyan Village, Datang Village, Jinshan Village, Jingtou Village, Fenshui Village, Hongshan Village, Lubei Village, Lu Ao Village, and Xitang Village.\n\n\n== Industry and production ==\nThe industries in Lupu Town mainly involve pharmaceutical packaging rubber processing, auto parts, valves, imitation leather soles, etc., but the only characteristic industries that have actually formed a certain scale are pharmaceutical packaging and marine aquaculture. In 1978, Lupu Salt Field was established, belonging to Zhejiang Province's standard salt field, with 80 hectares of salt fields and a production of 4,000 tons of crude salt in 1988. In 1971, Yuhuan County Firecracker Craft Factory was established, mainly producing electric firecrackers. In 1985, it ranked first in Zhejiang Province and fifth in China. Lupu was then known as the \"hometown of firecrackers\".\n\n\n== Agriculture ==\nThe paddy fields in Lupu Town mainly grow rice, while the reclaimed land grows sweet potatoes, vegetables, melons, and fruits. In order to expand the planting area of food crops, 18 hectares of paddy fields were built on reclaimed land from 1987 to 1988 for rice cultivation. In addition, local village enterprises engage in fisheries production, including grouper, yellow croaker, perch, sea bream, razor shells, prawn, etc. Local residents also plant various varieties of peach trees, citrus, pomelo, blood oranges, navel oranges, grapes, bayberries, etc., in the mountains and forests.\n\n\n== Education and culture ==\nThere is currently one primary school in Lupu Town. Cultural facilities include cultural stations, radio stations, video halls, and cinemas. The \"Ji En Poem\" cliff inscriptions and the \"Holy Teachings Poem\" cliff inscriptions are both listed as cultural relics protection units in Zhejiang Province.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional references ===\n\"2023年芦浦镇统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码\".
