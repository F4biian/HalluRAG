        "content": "The Iluro Sport Club was a Spanish multi-sport club located in Mataró, Maresme, founded in 1912, considered the predecessor of the current CE Mataró. It contested two finals of the second category Catalan Championship in 1923 and 1924.\nIn addition to football, the club also created its sections of field hockey in 1928, basketball in 1939, also known as Iluro BC, which won the Catalan basketball Championship in 1934. The club disappeared in 1939.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings of football in Mataró ===\nThe first references to football in Mataró can be found in 1901, when members of the Sociedad Colombófila Mensajera Iluro, based in the Sport Mataronés building, began to play inside the local velodrome wearing a red and white striped t-shirt. These two teams, Iluro and Mataróní, played a few matches throughout the 1910s, but football did not begin to be organized in earnest until the following decade, driven by the students of Escolapis and Valldemia schools. That first entity did not come to fruition, football continued to grow and be practiced both in streets and squares as well as in the Colegio de los Hermanos Escolapios de Santa Ana, with the first serious club emerging in early 1911, FC Catalunya de Mataró, which played on an Escolapis lot in the Lepant street, and which played two matches with a team from Vilassar de Mar on 11 February and 25 March 1911, the latter at the old Velòdrom de Mataró, located in the current Central Park. This team was only officially established in April 1911 with Salvador Garriga as its first president.\nThe Catalonia SC initiative had an immediate effect on another group of young people who played in the municipal park and, in that same month, members of Sport Mataronés founded the Mataró Foot-ball Club, with a board chaired by Joaquim Soler, wearing initially red and white t-shirt. As time went by, both clubs saw the need to unite to increase their social and sporting mass, being merged in December, continuing under the name Mataró FC, registering a few days later in the Catalan Football Federation where it was considered a Second Category club. The growing trend of the infant society increased and on 1 January 1912, the Campo de Fomento (Fomento Mataroní) was inaugurated, property of the aforementioned Sport Mataronés, which had been a national shooting and football field located in the current Ronda d'Alfons X, next to the Paseo de Cabanelles and the Convent of the Capuchinas. On its inauguration day, the field hosted the so-called Copa Mataró organized by \"Mataró FC\", having as guests FC Barcelona and Catalá SC, both from Catalonia, and according to the local press, the Blaugranas demonstrated \"in every game a lot of superiority over the opposing club\", beating Mataró 7–0. A few months later, on 30 June, Mataró played a friendly match against RCD Espanyol at the Campo del Fomento Mataroní, and it surprisingly won 3–2, with the chronicles of that match stating that it was \"one of the most beautiful played in Mataró\", and highlighted the defense made-up of Ximenes and Cuadrada, which \"played extraordinarily\". In addition to facing clubs around him in the Catalan football championship, Mataró FC, now wearing red and black with black pants and chaired by Josep Soler Moreu, also faced Valldemia FC, another local club born around that time that, together with the Escuelas Pías, served as a quarry for a large number of young people to train.\n\n\n=== Iluro SC ===\nAt the end of 1912, internal disputes between members of Mataró FC ended up causing some of them to leave to found a new club where they could start again, titled Iluro Sport Club, which played their first match on 29 December, losing 3–0 to FC Vilasar. This result did not discourage the club who, wearing a black shirt with black pants, strengthened the steps to elect its first Board of Directors on 2 March 1913 with Josep Serra as president, Jaume Subirá as vice president, Pelegrí Lluriá as secretary, Joan Escapa as an accountant, and a certain Mr. Parera took care of the treasury.\nWith the new National Shooting Range located on the Paseo de Rocafonda used by Sport Mataronés, which was just a few hundred meters away from Campo de Fomento, Iluro SC soon gained more and more followers, until having enough to not only hold second and third teams, but also to beat Mataró FC in their intense duels, a power struggle that continued until the summer of 1915 when Mataró FC, poorly managed and with continuous changes of directors, ended up folding and disappearing. In 1914, Iluro SC contested its first regional competitions and in 1915, the club moved to the field of play of the now-defunct FC Mataró.\nWith hardly any opposition in the town, the club had no activity for a long time, and in 1917, the board of directors of Iluro SC demanded to use Campo de Fomento as it was better conditioned for football practice, an request that was approved and then celebrated on 8 July, inviting FC Barcelona with whom they lost 0–1. In the purely sporting aspect, the club advanced to the Second Category of the Catalan championship, finishing fifth in the 1917–18 season with a total of six participants and first in the 1918–19 and 1919–20 campaigns without being able to advance in category in a few years where changing status was not always feasible.\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, football fans in Mataró increased with the constitution of new societies such as the Club Deportivo Mataró, which was founded in 1922 by former Mataró FC players in an attempt to revitalize the defunct club, but Iluro SC maintained its hegemony in the Second Category where, after being sixth in the 1920–21 season, it was League champion for three consecutive seasons between 1922 and 1924, and contested two finals of the second category. In 1924, the club was finally able to ascend to Group B of the First Category, which was, de facto, the second regional level. The club debuted in 1924–25 with a magnificent second place after CD Júpiter from Barcelona, thus establishing themselves in this category, being fifth in the 1925–26 edition and seventh in the following year 1926–27 to be fourth in the season 1927–28 in times where professionalism, regularized by the Catalan Federation since 1925, meant the disappearance of CD Mataró, who could not survive such a harsh and demanding economic regime, leaving Iluro as the only banner Mataronense at the federated level.\nIn the 1930–31 season, with Salvador Cruixent as president, the team was one step away from gaining promotion to Primera A. On Christmas Day of 1935, the club inaugurated its new field, Les Rondes, which they lost 1–4 to CF Badalona. In the 1937–38 season, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, the Federation organized a Catalan League with First and Second Division clubs, which allowed Iluro to finally play against the greats of Catalan football.\n\n\n=== Decline and colapse ===\nOn 3 July 1939, due to the consequences of the war, Catalan names were prohibited, so Iluro was renamed as Club Deportivo Mataró.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Eiriña Club de Fútbol was a Spanish football club located in Pontevedra, Galicia, founded in 1922, and disappeared on 16 October 1941, when it merged with the Alfonso XIII CF to form the Pontevedra CF.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1921, the modest Lérez FC, encouraged by the Álvarez Limeses and the son of the Marquis of Riestra, wanted to grow, so it changed location and colors to become Eiriña FC, which became the best club in the prehistory of the Pontevedra football. Some of the members of Lérez FC were Antón Losada, Alexandre Bóveda, and Alfonso Rodríguez Castelao. The first references to Lérez FC date back to 1909, which played its games in A Xunqueira do Cobo.\n\n\n=== Golden age ===\nThe Eiriña Club de Fútbol was founded in 1922, taking its name from the A Eiriña neighborhood, and which wore a striped yellow and black jersey with black pants. Together with Alfonso XIII CF and the Pontevedra Athletic Club, Eiriña became one of the three most important clubs in the city in the early 1920s, competing in the Regional Championship of Galicia until 1926, when Pontevedra AC disappeared following a decline thanks largely to the arrival of professionalism.\nThe other two, Eiriña FC from Campo de Pasarón and Alfonso XIII FC from Campo de Burgo, managed to survive due to their youth and organization. In April 1931, the Spanish Second Republic was established and the Alfonsista club was forced to change its name, becoming known as Pontevedra Sport Club, continuing to compete until the arrival of the Spanish Civil War; while Eiriña FC became the main club in the city, proclaiming itself Champion of Serie B in 1923 and playing in the first Category since then. The team's greatest achievement was competing in Spain's Tercera División in consecutive seasons (1929–30, 1931–32, and 1932–33). The club then won the Galicia Amateur Championships in the 1932–33 and 1933–34, before being proclaimed Champion of the inaugural Copa Galicia in 1936, beating Deportivo de La Coruña 6–4 on aggregate in the final. With the arrival of the Civil War, all regional competitions were paralyzed and football activity gradually decreased, but not before Eiriña participated in the First Category of the South Championship where they placed fifth. In the 1937–38 season, the club participated in the Galician Championship, called the Galician Army Corps Cup, where it finished fourth and last classified.\n\n\n=== Decline and colapse ===\nWhen the war ended, both Eiriña and Pontevedra SC remained active, but the great sporting and human burden made the development of both in a different panorama almost unfeasible, so the directors decided to meet and study a way out of this situation, resulting in the merger of both into a single entity that was capable of representing the city with the proper support. Thus, on 16 October 1941, the Pontevedra Club de Fútbol was established and its first president was Fernando Ponte Conde.\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nDaniel Díaz de León\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Betis\n\nGalician Championship of Serie B:\nChampions (1): 1922–23\nRegional Championship of Galicia:\nChampions (2): 1932–33 and 1933–34\nCopa Galicia:\nChampions (1): 1936\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oliwa Abbey was the Cistercian monastic community in Oliwa (now a district of Gdańsk), the oldest monastic establishment in Gdańsk Pomerania, which existed continuously from 1188 to 1831, and from 1466 to 1772 consistently sided with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in its ongoing disputes with Gdańsk. The monastery buildings were repeatedly destroyed by pagan Prussians, Brandenburgers, Teutonic Knights, Hussites, Swedes, Russians, and the people of Gdańsk itself. In the twilight years of its existence, the abbey became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 following the First Partition of Poland. Due to Prussian dissolution policies, the Cistercian order was abolished in 1831.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nFrom the mid-12th century, numerous Cistercian monasteries were established in the Polish lands, especially in Greater Poland, Pomerania, western Lesser Poland, and Silesia: Łekno (1153), Lubiąż (1163), Kołbacz (1173), Ląd (1173), Sulejów (1176), Wąchock (1179), Koprzywnica (1185), Mogiła (1222), Henryków (1227), and others. Somewhat later, a few Cistercian convents were established: Trzebnica (1203), Ołobok (1211), and Owińska (1250).\nThe composition of the convents was overwhelmingly foreign. The Cistercians of Lesser Poland originated from Morimond in Burgundy (now in Champagne), and until the late Middle Ages, French and Italians predominated here. In the convents in other regions, there were mostly Germans – only the citizens of Cologne were admitted to the Greater Polish Łekno, Ląd, or Obra (1240) (a filial of the Cistercian abbey in Altenberg near Cologne). In Kołbacz and its subsequent filials, Danes dominated.\nWithout the orders – both in terms of secular and ecclesiastical authorities – the process of civilization and Christianization of the Polish territories would undoubtedly have proceeded much more slowly. The monks brought with them a broad knowledge of literature, architecture, agriculture, various crafts, and, above all, management. Their activities laid the foundation for the structure of the Piast states during the period of territorial fragmentation.\nThe idea of bringing the Cistercians to Pomerania is attributed in the chronicles of the Oliwa Abbey to the Gdańsk duke Sobieslaw I. In reality, the founder was the son of Sobieslaw, Duke Sambor I, who in 1186 brought them from Kołbacz: The Pomeranian Duke Sambor settled the Cistercian order in a place called Oliwa. The group of monks was led by the Dane Bernard Dithard, who became the first abbot. The Kołbacz Abbey was a filial of the Danish Esrum Abbey, so the monks who came to Oliwa were probably mostly from Denmark.\n\nOn 18 March 1188, the foundation act was ceremonially signed in Gdańsk. The monastery received valuable privileges enabling it to derive income from fishing and mills on the Oliwa Stream. It also received several villages, including the one that the monks named: Olyva, ubi coenobium constructum est (English: Oliwa, where the community is being built). Among linguists, there has long been a dispute over the origin of this name, with most agreeing that the etymology should be sought in the Slavic name of the river Oława, mistakenly associated by the monks who did not know the old Kashubian language with an olive, and consequently with the Mount of Olives.\nThe original monastery consisted of only twelve monks. Therefore, they limited themselves to building a Romanesque oratory and wooden residential buildings. Only in the first half of the 13th century was the oratory adapted into a chancel, elongated chapels were added on both sides, characteristic of the Cistercian church in Fontenay, on the plans of which many Cistercian temples were modeled. At that time, the transept and the main body of the church were built, with a length of four bays of the current nave, as well as the first brick monastery buildings. Around 1300, the Church of St. James was also built, intended – as a parish church – for the local population.\n\n\n== Under the rule of the dukes of Pomerania ==\n\nAround 1195, the monks from the Oliwa Abbey were removed, and new ones were sent from Kołbacz; presumably, it was due to disciplinary issues. However, the abbey flourished, and the generous donations of the dukes meant that by the end of the 13th century, the Oliwa Abbey owned 50 villages, a fishing station on the now practically nonexistent Zaspa Lake with a fleet of 40 boats, as well as exclusive rights to use the Strzyża stream and have mills on it, not to mention tithes from tariffs and Gdańsk taverns: decimam etiam de omnibus tabernis.\n\nIn 1226, the monastery was plundered and burned by pagan Prussians, and the monks were massacred in front of the inhabitants. Soon after, new monks arrived from Kołbacz and began rebuilding, but in 1236, the Prussians returned, burning the buildings and killing six monks and thirty-four servants. The first of these attacks led Pope Honorius III to exempt the Cistercians of Oliwa from tithes. The abbey also experienced several raids by the Teutonic Knights; in 1246, the knights burnt down the monastery, and in 1247 and 1252, they plundered it. These were retaliatory strikes on the lands of Świętopełk II, whom the Teutonic Knights suspected of inciting the Prussians to revolt.\nIn 1294, another guardian of the abbey, Duke Mestwin II, died. In 1274, he had prohibited outsiders from logging in the forests belonging to the Oliwa Abbey. He was buried in the monastery church, like other Pomeranian rulers.\nFor Mestwin's funeral, Przemysł II – the Duke of Greater Poland, who, under an earlier agreement, inherited power in Pomerania – came to Oliwa. The unification of both regions opened the way for his coronation. However, he did not reign for long; he was murdered in 1296. For the next dozen or so years, Pomerania changed hands. First, its ruler was Duke Władysław I Łokietek, but in 1300, Wenceslaus II, ruling in Bohemia, became the king of Poland. In 1305, he was succeeded by Wenceslaus III, but before he could settle on the throne, he was assassinated in 1306. At that time, Pomerania was again taken over by Władysław Łokietek, who was gathering Polish lands, but soon he lost it. In 1308, nearby Gdańsk was occupied by the Brandenburgers, who inflicted significant damage on the abbey, which in 1310 was compensated by Margrave Waldemar, later mentioned among the benefactors of the abbey.\n\n\n== During the Teutonic era ==\n\nAfter the Gdańsk massacre in 1308, Oliwa, along with the entire Pomerania, came under the Teutonic Order's rule. Abbot Rüdiger had to acknowledge the status quo. Despite this, and the confirmation in 1312 of the monastery's possessions by the Grand Master Karl von Trier, there were initially numerous disputes over property and territory between the Cistercian monastery and the Order. Therefore, at the request of the abbot of Oliwa, Pope John XXII confirmed the monastery's possessions in 1320. The bishops of Warmia and Pomesania also confirmed the monastery's property undividedness in 1323.\nThe abbots of Oliwa recognized the Teutonic Knights' authority. They even took their side during disputes with Poland before the pope. This did not prevent them, in 1325, despite the explicit prohibition of the Teutonic Knights, from paying Peter's Pence to the Polish bishops. Eventually, Oliwa's disputes with the Teutonic Order ceased in 1342, when Grand Master Ludolf König von Wattzau recognized all the Cistercians' claims.\nOn 25 March 1350, fire completely consumed the church and monastery; the fire likely broke out during the cleaning of the kitchen chimney. The church was rebuilt within five years, adopting a Gothic style. The chancel was extended eastward, and an ambulatory and an abbey chapel of the Holy Cross were built in place of the abolished chapels. The main nave was extended by four bays, giving the temple its current dimensions. During this time, a large refectory and a lavabo were also built in the monastery. Money for the reconstruction came, among other sources, from the treasury of Grand Master Heinrich Dusemer.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, there was a clear relaxation of discipline, partly due to the monastery's financial situation. The Teutonic Knights imposed high taxes on the monastery's estates from 1401 to 1403 due to the escalating conflict with King Władysław II Jagiełło. This was compounded by epidemics in 1416 and 1427, followed by an invasion of Hussite Taborites allied with Poland. In 1433, Hussites led by Jan Čapek of Sány caused serious damage to the abbey and its estates, including burning down Sopot, but they did not capture Gdańsk, where the monks from Oliwa took refuge.\nIn 1454, the Thirteen Years' War broke out. King Casimir IV Jagiellon, at the request of the Prussian cities, declared the incorporation of Prussia. Visiting the cities of Pomerania, he visited Oliwa in 1457. The abbey supported the Prussian Confederation, providing financial support and siding with the king. The Teutonic Knights tried to regain the lost territories, so the royal troops defending Gdańsk occupied the Oliwa Abbey. 600 soldiers under Gotard of Radlin surrounded Oliwa with a ring of fortifications.\nUltimately, after 1466, as a result of the Second Peace of Thorn, Gdańsk Pomerania passed into Polish hands as Royal Prussia.\n\n\n== During the Reformation era ==\n\nIn the second half of the 15th century, attempts were made to annex the monasteries in Oliwa and Pelplin to the Polish provincial convents, but in 1487, the general chapter of the Cistercian Order in Cîteaux, Burgundy, issued a decree stating that both convents belonged to the Baltic province. Oliwa was visited by abbots from Kołbacz, which probably contributed to the removal of Abbot Piotr Smitzingius.\nFrom 1474 to 1488, Abbot Mikołaj Muskendorf carried out renovation and construction work in the abbey and its estates. In 1516, the Oliwa Abbey provided hospitality to Albert of Prussia, which was viewed as hostile to the Crown, as during the war of 1519–1521, mercenary units from Brandenburg passed through Oliwa. The monks explained that Albert was the Grand Master of the Order, and the abbey provided him with lodging as a dignitary of the Church.\nThe 16th century saw increasing influences of the Reformation in Gdańsk and Pomerania. After 1525, the Pomeranian nobility, leaning towards the Reformation, began demanding that the Cistercians join the mendicant orders and leave the monastery, living on alms. King Sigismund I the Old intervened on behalf of the Oliwa Cistercians, entrusting the protection of the abbey to Voivode Jerzy Bażyński. In 1540, the Gdańsk City Council decreed that the Oliwa monastery should support education, but the abbots cited low income as a reason not to comply. In the same year, an attempt was made to transfer the estates of the Oliwa and Pelplin monasteries to the diocesan bishop, but the Pelplin abbot personally sought confirmation of his possessions from King Sigismund II Augustus. In the entire Pomeranian province, only Oliwa and Pelplin remained, as other abbeys ceased to exist.\nThe influences of the Reformation were also felt in Oliwa. In 1549, Lambert Schlieff, favoring Protestantism, was appointed abbot. The choice was made under pressure from the Loitz family, which had significant influence on the king. Schlieff was supported by the Bishop of Warmia. In 1555, King Sigismund Augustus granted Schlieff indygenat. The Oliwa Chronicle called Schlieff uneducated, disobedient, and wasteful of the abbey's wealth, which led to his removal from office in 1557. This was initiated by Kasper Geschkau, who accused Schlieff of various crimes. Initially, the king stopped supporting Schlieff, but under the influence of his powerful backers, he reinstated him as abbot. In 1559, on his way to the abbey, Schlieff died, but he managed to appoint his successor, Mikołaj Locka.\nMikołaj Locka obtained confirmation of his position from the king, but in Oliwa, Kasper Geschkau held office. He was removed (by royal order) only through the use of force. Mikołaj Locka assumed the office of abbot, but Geschkau sought support with all his might. In 1567, he regained royal favor, and in 1568, he reached an agreement with Mikołaj Locka, whereby he became the bishop coadjutor of the Oliwa abbey, a position that ensured succession after the death of the incumbent abbot. In 1569, Geschkau obtained the nomination and took office in Oliwa. Soon, Geschkau, along with Bishop Stanisław Karnkowski of Kuyavia and Castellan Jan Kostka of Gdańsk, stood at the head of the royal Maritime Commission and acted several times as the king's spokesmen in disputes with Gdańsk (over the church occupied by Protestants, over the Livonian War, over the fleet of privateers and over repayment of loans).\n\nWhen Gdańsk rebelled against King Stephen Báthory's rule, Abbot Geschkau was already known as a supporter of the Commonwealth and had repeatedly angered the city. In February 1577, an attack by Protestant Gdańsk citizens occurred. Geschkau managed to escape, but the abbey was looted and completely burned down. Two monks were killed, and several were wounded. The surviving walls of the monastery were to be demolished by the Gdańsk citizens, but relief arrived in the form of royal troops led by starosta Ernest Wejher. A year later, Gdańsk finally recognized Báthory's authority and was forced to pay 20,000 guilders in compensation. Thanks to this, as well as the generous donations of the king and magnates, the reconstruction of the monastery could begin immediately. All monastery buildings and the church were rebuilt in their former shape and style. Only a baptismal chapel was added, along with Baroque decorations. The church began functioning again in 1583. Until then, the Cistercians had lived in the Carthusian monastery taken over by Geschkau. Kasper Geschkau died in 1584. Just before his death, the reconstruction of the old abbey palace, which, according to the Annales Monasterii Olivensis, had once been the duke's residence, was completed: ubi consuerunt habitare fundatores huius monasterii (English: where the founders of this abbey used to live).\n\n\n== During the reign of the House of Vasa ==\n\nJan Kostka, became the next abbot, holding this dignity from 1584 until his death in 1588. In 1587 – while he was still alive – King Sigismund III Vasa visited Oliwa and swore the pacta conventa. That year it was also agreed that the election of Oliwa abbots would be at the discretion of the bishops of Włocławek. In 1588, Dawid Konarski became abbot. During his reign, the landed estates and properties seized ten years earlier by Kasper Geschkau were returned to the Carthusian Order.\nIn 1594, the renovation of the church was completed. In the same year, King Sigismund, accompanied by his wife Anna, visited Oliwa. The Catholic monarch had a fondness for Oliwa – in the summer of 1598, he spent over a month in the monastery, and in the autumn, he visited Oliwa again. In 1603, he obtained from Pope Clement VIII the right for the Oliwa abbots to wear the mitre and carry the crozier. In 1623, when King Sigismund was in Gdańsk, his second wife, Constance of Austria, visited Oliwa. In 1596, the priorate was expanded. In 1603, the first pipe organ was built, followed by a pulpit in 1605. In 1604, the reconstructed Church of St. James was consecrated. In 1605 and 1608, the monastery walls were rebuilt, reflecting the real threat from the Swedes. The threat must have been significant, as it prompted the Cistercians to deposit their archives and treasury in Gdańsk. In 1616, Dawid Konarski passed away, and Adam Trebnic succeeded him as abbot.\nIn 1626, the monastery was plundered by Swedish forces under the command of Admiral Carl Gyllenhielm. It was during this time that the Renaissance pulpit and pipe organs were taken to the Swedish Skokloster Castle. The Oliwa convent survived the war with the Swedes in Gdańsk, returning to Oliwa in 1628. Earlier, in 1627, a battle took place between the Polish and Swedish fleets in the Gdańsk Bay. The war ended in 1629, and in 1630, Abbot Adam Trebnic passed away. Considering that the monastery had lost a significant part of its furnishings, successive abbots (Jan Grabiński, Aleksander Grabiński, Michał Konarski, and Aleksander Kęsowski) funded a new, this time Baroque, interior for the church.\nIn 1635, King Władysław IV, papal nuncio Honoriusz Visconti, and French envoy d'Avaux visited Oliwa. In 1646, the official welcome of the royal fiancée – Duchess Marie Louise Gonzaga of Mantua – took place in Oliwa. The duchess was greeted by a procession of diplomats and state dignitaries on behalf of King Władysław and the Commonwealth. Five years later, Marie Louise, now alongside her second husband, King John II Casimir, visited Oliwa once again.\nThe years from 1655 to 1660 marked another war with the Swedes, known in Poland as the \"Swedish Deluge\". Many monks left Oliwa during this time. The treasury and library of the monastery were moved to Gdańsk, which the Swedes failed to capture. However, the Oliwa Abbey was plundered by Swedish soldiers under Gustaf Otto Stenbock in 1656. The monks sought help from the garrison of Gdańsk, who indeed drove out the Swedes from the abbey but then themselves began to loot and demolish the monastery. The war with the Swedes concluded with negotiations in Oliwa; held in the abbey, they resulted in the signing of the peace treaty on 3 May 1660. During the negotiations, the royal court resided in Gdańsk, the Swedes were stationed in Sopot, and the French mediators resided in the monastery.\n\n\n== Times of \"peace\" ==\n\nIn 1665, a new building for the monastery hospital was erected, and in 1676, a printing press was established. In 1677 and 1678, King John III Sobieski visited the abbey, residing there for several months while resolving disputes between the council and the guilds. When Karol Łoknicki passed away in 1683, King Sobieski appointed Michał Antoni Hacki as the abbot of Oliwa. Hacki, who had previously served as prior since 1660, also ventured into diplomacy and clandestine services. John Sobieski appointed him as his secretary and utilized him for diplomatic missions. Hacki was an agent of the royal counterintelligence, successfully deciphering diplomatic letters from foreign powers. Upon moving to Oliwa, Hacki contributed to the development of the monastery. He funded much of the Baroque furnishings for the church, particularly the main altar completed in 1688. In 1697, when François Louis, a French candidate for the Polish crown, arrived in Oliwa, Abbot Hacki sided with his Saxon competitor, Augustus II the Strong, enabling the Polish-Saxon forces to disperse the French. In the spring of 1698, King Augustus II, hosted by Abbot Hacki, visited Oliwa to inspect the site of the battle.\nDuring the reign of Abbot Hacki, the monumental Baroque main altar, which occupies the entire wall space and the vault of the eastern closure of the chancel, was erected in 1688. The altar is probably the work of the Gdańsk architect and sculptor Andreas Schlüter, and the painting depicting Hacki and the monks praying to the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and St. Bernard was created in the workshop of Andrzej Stech. The old monastery treasury was also rebuilt to house the pharmacy, the abbey court, the priests' and church servants' apartments, and a printing press operating from 1673 to 1744.\nIn 1702, during the Great Northern War, Saxon troops wintered in Oliwa, which suffered from contributions and requisitions. Kazimierz Dąbrowski succeeded the deceased Abbot Hacki in 1703. During his tenure, the tower of the Church of St. James was rebuilt in 1709 – the year of a major plague that claimed the lives of hundreds of Oliwa residents. This was one of many epidemics in Pomerania, but the Oliwa monastery felt its effects particularly strongly. Nine Cistercian pastoral ministers died consecutively in the Gate House (known since then as the \"House of Pestilence\"). In the following year, the General Assembly of Prussia met in Oliwa, attended by King Augustus II. The king also visited Oliwa in 1716. In 1722, Abbot Kazimierz Dąbrowski passed away, and Franciszek Mikołaj Zaleski succeeded him. In the same year, the Oliwa Shooting Brotherhood was established, responsible for assisting in the Corpus Christi processions.\n\nIn 1733, after the death of King Augustus II, the War of the Polish Succession broke out, with fighting for the throne between Augustus III and Stanisław Leszczyński. Gdańsk sided with Leszczyński, while Oliwa remained with the Wettins. Although the abbot occasionally visited Leszczyński, who resided in Gdańsk, he also sought the protection of the Russian commanders supporting Augustus. During the siege of Gdańsk in 1734, the abbey palace housed the Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich, sparing Oliwa from destruction, although other monastery properties suffered from the military actions. After the conclusion of the 145-day siege of Gdańsk, King Augustus III stayed in Oliwa, where he received the homage of the Gdańsk citizens and then held a reception in the monastery gardens in honor of his supporters, especially his patron – Empress Anna of Russia.\n\nIn 1736, King August III agreed to abide by the principle of free choice of the abbot of Oliwa. However, this was to apply only to one candidate, Jacek Rybiński, as during his lifetime, the First Partition of Poland took place, and the Prussian occupier had no intention of respecting agreements made by Polish rulers. As a token of gratitude for the preservation of the abbey, the cult of St. Oliwa was established, initiated by Hacki. In 1738, the abbot, along with prior Iwo Roweder (the abbot was one of the authors of the Oliwa Chronicle), traveled to the Cistercian authorities in Cîteaux to seek approval for the new cult on Pomeranian land. The Oliwa Shooting Brotherhood was reactivated for this purpose, to enhance the festivities associated with the introduction of the cult of St. Oliwa. The ceremonies took place from 5 to 6 June 1739, and the highlight was the transfer of the saint's relics from the Church of St. James to the monastery church. In 1739, thanks to Abbot Iwo Roweder, a philosophical-theological academy was established, which operated until 1783.\n\nAt the initiative of Abbot Rybiński, the Church of St. James was renovated in 1736 (a new dome was added), as well as the no longer existing St. Lazarus Hospice. From 1754 to 1756, a new rococo abbey palace and a new pulpit were built. Rybiński's most significant undertaking was the commissioning of new pipe organs. Initially, the abbot ordered small organs from Father Johann Wulff (in the transept of the church), then sent him at his own expense to study under the best European masters. Upon his return, Rybiński commissioned him to build the large organs in the main nave.\n\n\n== From Partitions to closure ==\n\nThe splendor of the abbey came to an end in 1772, with the First Partition of Poland, when Oliwa fell under Prussian rule. The Prussian state seized all the monastery's assets except for those within the territory of Gdańsk (which defended its independence for some time). The abbot was granted an annual pension of 4000 guilders, and the monastery received a monetary compensation. In 1782, Abbot Jacek Rybiński passed away. Bishop Ignacy Krasicki, a frequent guest at the abbey, sought his position, but the Prussian king appointed his cousin, Duke Karol von Hohenzollern, as the commendatory abbot, who also became the abbot of Pelplin.\nThe suddenly impoverished convent had to start selling off some of the artworks from the church furnishings. Thus, a Baroque pulpit, 8 relief biblical scenes, and 7 scenes of the Passion (probably all from the workshop of Andreas Götcken) were transferred to the parish church in Brzóza, purchased in Oliwa by General Stanisław Ożarowski.\nIn 1793, Karol Hohenzollern leased the nearby Pachołek Hill (German: Karlsberg – named after the abbot) and built a scenic belvedere, later replaced by a stone observation tower. In 1798, King Frederick William II and his wife Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz visited the place. Karol honored his guests by naming one of the hills \"Louise's Mountain\". After Karol's death in 1803, his successor was Duke Józef Hohenzollern-Hechingen.\nIn 1807, the pipe organs builder, Father Michał Wulff, passed away. That same year, Gdańsk was captured by Napoleonic and Polish forces. A French lazaretto was set up in Oliwa. When the first Free City of Danzig was established, including Oliwa, the monastery ceased to receive subsidies from the Prussian state and was forced to sell silver items from the church and monastery. In 1813, there was a Russian siege of Gdańsk. After the fall of Gdańsk, Oliwa was definitively annexed to the Prussian state. In 1820, authorities issued a ban on admitting novices, and in 1829, an order for the monastery's liquidation was issued. It took place on 1 October 1831. The monastery and abbatial properties were divided between the city of Gdańsk and the Prussian king. The last abbot, Józef Hohenzollern-Hechingen, passed away in 1836. Parishes were established in place of the abbey: a Catholic one headquartered in the former monastery church and an Evangelical one in the Church of St. James.\nOver the centuries, most of the monastery's industrial facilities were destroyed. There were over twenty mills along the Oliwa Stream and its tributaries, powered by water. They were numbered against the current of the stream – from Mill I in Jelitkowo to Mill XXIV in the Krzaczasty Mill Valley. The largest among them was the Water Forge, which still exists today. In the mid-18th century, the forge's tenant was required to pay the monastery 140 florins annually and supply about 485 kg of iron per year. Even in 1830, the facility produced almost 200 tons of various metal products.\nThe Cistercians returned to Oliwa in 1945, but they did not regain the abbey. They took over the former Evangelical church on Leśna Street (German: Waldstraẞe), now dedicated to Our Lady Queen of the Polish Crown, along with the building at 131 Polanki Street, converted into a convent. Their priory is under the Szczyrzyc Abbey. In 1988, a separate parish was established at the church.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOliwa\nOliwa Cathedral\nHistory of Gdańsk\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCieślak, Edmund (1993).

        "content": "The National Institute of Radio and Television of Peru (Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisión del Perú, IRTP) is a Peruvian state-owned company that is responsible for managing the state's media, in radio, television and the Internet. It is property of the Peruvian State, is part of the Ministry of Culture and has administrative, economic and financial autonomy.\nThe IRTP manages the TV Perú television network, an international channel, a pay channel and three DTT signals, in addition to a radio network and two radio stations. In 2016, it had a budget of S/. 68 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nOAX-AM (Radio Nacional del Perú) began its broadcasts in 1925 in the city of Lima; It was the first radio station in the country. On the other hand, OAD-TV (TV Perú) began broadcasting in 1958 on channel 7 of the VHF band in Lima as the country's second open television station. One of the first pioneering organizations in the production of content, such as the television series Nuestros Héroes de la Guerra del Pacífico, was the \"National Institute of Teleeducation\" (Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Teleducación). This institution, consolidated in the 1960s, was important for the production of educational content and prevailed in parallel with the future state media company until its closure in 1995.\nIn 1973, during the self-proclaimed Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, the National Radio Broadcasting Company of Peru (Spanish: Empresa Nacional de Radiodifusión del Perú, ENRAD Perú) was created, an entity that brought together Channel 7 of Lima and Radio Nacional, in addition to managing certain expropriated media such as Radio La Crónica AM or Channel 9 in Lima. In parallel and until the end of the regime, the commercial shareholders of the América and Panamericana television networks founded the company Telecentro, a subsidiary in charge of programming production for both stations, in response to the expropriation of 51% of their shares by the State. During this time, at the end of 1976, Channel 7 in Lima began to progressively broadcast in colour, producing all of its programming in this technology in 1979.\nIn 1981, months after the second government of Fernando Belaúnde Terry began, ENRAD Peru was reorganized under the name Peruvian Film, Radio and Television Company (Spanish: Empresa de Cine, Radio y Televisión Peruana, ENCRTP) and was temporarily assigned to the National System of Social Communication (Spanish: Sistema Nacional de Comunicación Social, SINACOSO). Furthermore, in that same year, Channel 7 of Lima changed its name to Radio Televisión Peruana (RTP) and began satellite transmissions. This last event allowed it to increase and consolidate its coverage at the national level since, until then, its repeater stations in the rest of the country retransmitted the programming of the main station in Lima via microwave. There were plans to form the Production Center for original content in 1982; However, the company had trouble establishing what content was profitable when it retired programming educational content in 1984.\nRTP was the main attempt to become public and commercially competitive broadcasting. Furthermore, in 1985, regional subsidiaries were established under the name sociedad anónima. However, that corporation entered an ambiguous situation due to its editorial dependence on the government of the day. It was liquidated in 1996 by former president Alberto Fujimori. Also during Fujimori's government, both SINACOSO and ENCRTP were unified into a single entity renamed to its current name (IRTP) in 1997.\n\n\n=== Denomination change ===\nIn the early 2000s, Valentín Paniagua's government undertook a restructuring of the IRTP. This initiative involved the recruitment of professionals without political ties, as well as the incorporation of new presenters with different perspectives. Additionally, the IRTP launched Radio Filarmonía, a station specialized in classical music and opera, in agreement with the Radio Filarmonía.\nIn 2004, an international television channel was planned on the Lima UHF band, called TNP 2 (currently TV Perú 7.2), with programming differentiated from TNP. However, the project was rejected at the end of Alejandro Toledo's government. In 2007, the focus was on investing in the news sector at the local and regional level, acquiring transmitters (19 UHF and 18 VHF) to expand coverage to 13 million viewers.\nFollowing the restructuring, the IRTP came under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister. Subsequently, between July 2010 and January 2012, it was temporarily subordinated to the Ministry of Culture. Since the government of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the IRTP has remained attached to said Ministry.\n\n\n=== Digitalisation era ===\nThe IRTP increased its production of its own content after María Luisa Málaga assumed the position of Board of Directors and executive president of the IRTP in 2012. The news channel TV Perú 7.3 was launched on November 3, 2013, after acquiring an old building in the San Borja District and counting on a new investment to renew its technical equipment. Additionally, on December 2 of that same year, it launched TV Perú 7.4, a cultural channel. Since the beginning of 2015, the children's programming block TV Perú niños has been broadcast on TV Perú. On July 1, 2016, TV Perú 7.4 was replaced by Canal IPe, a children's and cultural channel. In the field of radio, the FM frequency reached 53% of the national territory, while its AM frequency reached 14.6% and Radio La Crónica, 29%.\nOn August 3, 2016, the writer and journalist Hugo Coya was appointed as president of the board due to the resignation of María Luisa Málaga. At that time the institute managed to raise 12% of its advertising budget. However, Coya resigned from the presidency of the board due to the pardon granted by the then President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to Alberto Fujimori. Then, the Ministry of Culture appointed journalist Eduardo Guzmán Iturbe to serve as president of the board of directors of this conglomerate.\nIn 2019, the IRTP decided to renew all its television media and proposed new plans and alternatives. That year, the 2019 Pan American and Parapan American Games were broadcast. In addition, it proposed to produce its own fiction programmes to export to other networks and thus reduce its dependence on the State.\nSubsequently, management chose to renew its information system, add new programs and include new services. Nacional TV (later renamed TV Perú 7.2) was launched and in March 2020, both Nacional TV and TV Perú Noticias began rebroadcasting TV Perú's programming due to the government's COVID-19 emergency decree. In April 2020, the Ministry of Education decreed the launch of \"Aprendo en casa\", a virtual education television channel aimed at students throughout Peru, which is planned to become an independent channel when the satellite hub service is completed in 2024.\nIn 2020, the government of Francisco Sagasti announced the reorganization of the IRTP, as did the National Superintendence of University Higher Education.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelecommunications in Peru\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Georgia O'Keeffe created a series of 20 paintings based on imagery from the Hawaiian Islands during her nine-week visit to the Territory of Hawaii in 1939. O'Keeffe's trip was part of an all-expenses paid commercial art commission from the Philadelphia advertising firm N. W. Ayer & Son on behalf of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, later known as Dole.  The company arranged for O'Keeffe to paint two works, without any artistic restrictions, for a magazine advertising campaign for pineapple juice.  Two of the paintings from this commission, Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii and Pineapple Bud, were used in advertisements that appeared in popular American magazines in 1940.\nThe exhibition of the complete Hawaii series of paintings, comprising flowers, landscapes, and cultural artifacts, has only been shown together in their entirety once, appearing in  O'Keeffe's original showing at An American Place from February 1 to March 17, 1940.  The original exhibition led to the sale of one work, Cup of Silver Ginger, which contemporaneously entered the collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Subsequent public exhibitions in 1990, 2013, and 2018, have shown only part of the series due to some of the works being held in different private and public museum collections. This series of Hawaii paintings by O'Keeffe is sometimes referred to as her \"tropical period\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nGeorgia O'Keeffe had previously worked as a commercial artist in the fashion advertisement industry in Chicago and for corporate and business commissions in New York.  It was ofen rumored that she was the uncredited designer of the logo for Old Dutch Cleanser. Her husband, Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946), was opposed to commercial art, and this created friction between them, particularly during the early 1930s, when O'Keeffe unsuccessfully tried to take over for Diego Rivera during the Man at the Crossroads controversy at Rockefeller Center. In late July 1938, O'Keeffe traveled to Stieglitz's 36 acre, family estate on the western shore of Lake George in Adirondack Park. After arriving, she wrote to friend and fellow artist William Einstein (1907–1972) (a distant cousin of Stieglitz, whose work Stieglitz exhibited at his gallery that same year) telling him that she had been in discussion that summer with a representative from advertising firm N. W. Ayer & Son about taking a commission for a pineapple company.  In the letter she notes that an advertising executive flew out to Hawaii on a China Clipper plane to discuss the proposal with the client.  O'Keeffe tells Einstein that she does not know if the deal will even go through, and she is somewhat indifferent to it, but she admits that the brochures about the Hawaiian Islands got her attention.\n\n\n== Ayer commission ==\nIn the 1930s, Ayer art director Charles T. Coiner of Philadelphia advertising firm N. W. Ayer & Son was partly responsible for the popularity of marketing fine art with commercial products, particularly for clients like DeBeers, Steinway & Sons, and the Container Corporation of America. Coiner hired modern artists to perausde customers of the quality of purchasing products made by Ayer's clients in high-end magazine advertisements.  Coiner took the Dole account in 1933, making changes to their advertising strategy.  Before coming to Ayer, Dole focused on the health and nutrition of pineapple. Coiner turned this around and changed the product attention to Hawaii itself.  Japanese-American painter Yasuo Kuniyoshi and California Scene painter Millard Sheets were matched with Dole advertisements.  Coiner next invited American artist Isamu Noguchi and modernist painter Georgia O'Keeffe to join the campaign. In the summer of 1938, O'Keeffe was offered an all-expenses paid, nine-week trip to the territory of Hawaii as a commercial art commission for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (Dole).  In exchange, O'Keeffe agreed to produce two paintings without artistic restrictions for a magazine advertising campaign for canned pineapple juice. O'Keeffe was hesitant at first, but Coiner managed to convince her to take the commission.\n\n\n== Voyage to Hawaii ==\nBefore traveling to the Hawaiian Islands, O'Keeffe finished hanging her paintings at Stieglitz's gallery in preparation for her annual exhibition at An American Place.  Georgia O'Keeffe: Exhibition of Oils and Pastels ran from January 22 to March 17, 1939, a showing of 22 paintings in her absence. On January 30, 1939, Stieglitz took O'Keeffe to the Grand Central Station in Manhattan, where she departed for the Hawaii Territory.  After arriving in San Francisco, O'Keeffe boarded the SS Lurline, a Matson luxury cruise ship that took her to Oahu, finally arriving in Honolulu on February 8. The entire trip, from New York to Hawaii, took her nine days.\n\n\n== Arrival, interisland travel ==\nO'Keeffe's ship arrived at Honolulu Harbor on February 8, 1939.  She was met by a representative from Ayer (thought to be John S. Coonley) who took a tender out to the boat, and Helen Richards, the wife of Atherton Richards, president and manager of Hawaiian Pineapple, who waited for O'Keeffe on the dock.  Both Coonley and Richards brought O'Keeffe traditional flower leis as a greeting, which greatly impressed her. She soon checked into the Moana Hotel in Waikīkī.  In a radio postal telegraph to Stieglitz soon after arriving, she writes: \"Arrived this morning feeling fine. Lovely summer weather here. Hope you are alright.\" \nO'Keeffe spent almost four of the nine weeks on Oahu. She wanted to live and work among the workers on the Dole plantation to best capture the images for her commission.  Contrary to her wishes, the pineapple company refused to allow this.  Due to the social, racial, and gender norms of the 1930s, the company discriminated against women and segregated the fieldworkers, making O'Keeffe's plan impossible for them to fulfill.  The company was also unable to provide adequate samples of the crops for her to model.  Angered by this treatment, the story goes, she was unable to paint the subject until she returned home. Research by Honolulu Museum of Art curator Theresa Papanikolas indicates that this established narrative may not be entirely accurate.  Papanikolas believes that letters written home by O'Keeffe indicate she tried to paint a pineapple while still in Hawaii.  \nOn February 23, she visited Kauai, spending two days on the island, visiting with artist Reuben Tam (1916–1991) in Kapaʻa.  During her stay, she was hosted by Robert Allerton and John Gregg Allerton at the former Hawaiian Royal tropical estate, now known as the Allerton Garden. After flying back to Oahu and spending additional time there, O'Keeffe visited Maui on March 10, where she was a guest of Willis Jennings, the manager of the Kaeleku Sugar Company plantation.  His daughter, Patricia Jennings, took O'Keeffe on a guided tour of Hana, Iao Valley, and Haleakalā crater.\nOn March 28, she left Maui for the Big Island on an interisland steamboat that arrived in Hilo the next day.  She was met by her hosts, the Shipman family, who took her on a tour of a black sand beach, and later Kīlauea, where she stayed at the Volcano House.  The next day, she traveled to Kona, and spent the remainder of her time there on the west side.  She returned to Honolulu on April 10 to prepare for her departure to the mainland.\n\n\n== Departure and return ==\nO'Keeffe left Hawaii on April 19, 1939, on the ocean liner SS Matsonia. Her first stop was in Los Angeles, followed by San Francisco, where she took a train back to New York. Upon her return to New York, she began to get back into her routine through the month of May, but she began to experience serious health problems.\nSometime in May, O'Keeffe began suffering from what she described as exhaustion. In a letter to art critic Henry McBride (1867–1962) dated July 22, 1939, she writes that she had been seeing a physician three times a week and had remained mostly bedridden for six weeks prior to the letter.  She experienced \"stomach problems, headaches, and weight loss\".  Meanwhile, the commission for Dole loomed large.  She began painting, and by June or July, O'Keeffe completed Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii, an image of a lobster claw heliconia, and Papaw Tree, Īao Valley, Maui, an image of a papaya tree.  Both were submitted to Ayer to fulfill the commission for the canned pineapple juice ads. She did not go to New Mexico that year and she stopped painting entirely until October.\nO'Keeffe often spoke about returning to Hawaii.  In 1958, she wrote a letter to Ansel Adams, telling him that her two best experiences were going to Yosemite with him and visiting Hawaii.  She eventually returned to Maui in 1982.\n\n\n== Advertisements ==\nAlthough it was never demanded or specified that O'Keeffe would produce a painting featuring a pineapple, her two submissions featuring a heliconia flower and a papaya tree caused some confusion.  Ayer art director Charles T. Coiner recalled that O'Keeffe \"came back with all kinds of beautiful paintings but nothing to do with pineapple...I said, 'I wonder if you couldn't paint the pineapple flower.'\" O'Keeffe explained to Coiner what had happened and how she was prevented from painting the pineapple by Dole and how she was provided with a terrible specimen unfit for painting.  Coiner quickly made arrangements to send her a viable plant. \nIn just 36 hours, Coiner had a new pineapple plant shipped by plane from Hawaii to New York for O'Keeffe to paint.  Sometime between June and July, O'Keeffe eventually completed her commission, producing two new paintings, Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii and Pineapple Bud, for Dole to use in their advertisements. Papaw Tree, Īao Valley, Maui, a painting of a papaya tree, a candidate for the commission, was rejected by Dole because their direct competitor at the time produced papaya juice.\nTwo separate print advertisements for Dole Pineapple Juice used two different paintings to accompany the ads. Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii and Pineapple Bud, were published in Vogue and the Saturday Evening Post in the 1940s. Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii shows an image of a red heliconia in close view with the ocean in the background along the bottom; an island can be seen along the horizon with low-lying clouds. The text accompanying the ad using Crab's Claw Ginger Hawaii reads in part: \"Hospitable Hawaii cannot send you its abundance of flowers or its sunshine.  But it sends you something reminiscent of both—golden, fragrant Dole Pineapple Juice.\" \nPineapple Bud shows a framed painting of a close-up of a small, newly formed pineapple surrounded by its leaves.  The ad presents this image in the context of art as a \"First Showing: A Dole Pineapple Bud from Hawaii\".  The text at the bottom of the ad reads in part: \"Perhaps you have never seen a pineapple bud—and words cannot describe the glowing crater of color which on the Dole plantations grows and ripens into a luscious big pineapple...Perhaps you have never tasted Dole Pineapple Juice—and there is no other way to discover the fragrant, zestful goodness of this pure juice.\".\n\n\n== Paintings ==\nOf the 20 Hawaii paintings O'Keeffe completed in 1939, there are eleven paintings of flowers, seven showing Hawaii landscapes, and two depicting cultural artifacts. Although Hawaii is known for its native plant species, none of the flowers or plants depicted in O'Keeffe's paintings are endemic to Hawaii. The plants and flowers O'Keeffe painted represent introduced species that had been brought to the Hawaiian Islands, initially by Polynesian voyagers, and much later, Europeans, over a combined period of 1500 years. It is not entirely clear which paintings were completed in Hawaii and which were finished on the mainland in New York, but O'Keeffe acknowledged this distinction in her original 1940 exhibition statement. Previously, art historians like Lisa Messinger have dismissed O'Keeffe's Hawaii paintings as \"very beautiful\", but of \"secondary importance\" because they were perceived as formulaic and lacking innovation.  Messinger considers O'Keeffe's Maui paintings as some of her best of the Hawaii period, with Bella Donna as her crowning achievement in the series.\n\n\n=== Flowers ===\nCrab's Claw Ginger Hawaii was owned by Dole Company from 1940 to 1976.  After that time, the work passed through 10 separate owners, finally settling with Laila and Thurston Twigg-Smith in 1988, where it remained for 33 years.  In 2021, it was sold by their descendant Sharon Twigg-Smith at Phillips for more than $7.7 million.\n\n\n=== Landscapes ===\nOn Maui, it is believed that O'Keeffe painted Black Lava Bridge, Hana Coast, No. I in Hana and her waterfall series at the Iao Valley.  O'Keffee painted for three days in late March at Iao Valley and talked about the experience in letters to Stieglitz and Ettie Stettheimer. Her guide on Maui, the young Patricia Jennings, witnessed O'Keeffe painting the waterfall series at Iao Valley and wrote about it, a somewhat rare event as O'Keeffe did not normally let people watch her paint.\n\n\n=== Cultural artifacts ===\nFishhook From Hawaii, No. 1 was bequested to the Brooklyn Museum in 1987 after O'Keeffe's death.  The Brooklyn Museum held a special place for O'Keeffe as that was where she held her first retrospective museum exhibition in 1927. Fishhook From Hawaii, No. 2 was gifted to the Alfred Stieglitz Collection at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1987, also after her death.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nO'Keeffe's Hawaii paintings have been exhibited together, in whole or in part, four times, initially by O'Keeffe herself in 1940.  Fifty years later, curator Jennifer Saville organized an exhibition in 1990, followed by two separate exhibitions curated by Theresa Papanikolas in 2013 and later in 2018. \nO'Keeffe's original exhibition of the Hawaii series was shown at her annual exhibition at An American Place from February 1 to March 17, 1940.  It was well received by the public and critics alike, and led to the sale of Cup of Silver Ginger to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Time magazine published a positive review of the exhibition.\nIn the intervening five decades, many of the paintings appeared by themselves at exhibitions, but were not all exhibited together as they existed in disparate public and private collections throughout the United States.  Saville was able to gather 18 of the 20 Hawaii paintings for the Georgia O'Keeffe: Paintings of Hawaiʻi exhibition at the Honolulu Academy of Arts from March 22 through May 6, 1990, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the original showing at An American Place.  \nIn 2013, Papanikolas organized 12 of the 20 works from the series along with a joint showing of Ansel Adams' work in Hawaii at the Georgia O'Keeffe and Ansel Adams: The Hawaiʻi Pictures exhibition, also at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, from July 18, 2013, until January 12, 2014. The exhibition traveled to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum from February 7 to September 14, 2014. In 2018, Papanikolas also curated the Georgia O'Keeffe: Visions of Hawaiʻi exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden, along with a horticultural exhibition of Hawaiian plants and flowers from the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. 17 of the 20 works in the Hawaii series were shown.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nFishhook from Hawaii – No. 1, 1939. Oil on canvas board, 18 x 14 inches (45.7 x 35.6 cm).

Currently, O'Kennon is a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chinese at Albion College.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nIn 1969, O’Kennon graduated from the University of Richmond. She went on to get a master's degree in mathematics in 1970 followed by a Master's in computer engineering in 1981, both from Clarkson University. For seven years, she worked as an adjunct professor in mathematics at Clarkston. Afterwards, she got a job in China teaching computer science where she also learned Mandarin.\nIn 1985, after her two years in China, O’Kennon became a professor of mathematics, computer science, and Chinese at Albion College. Her main area of research was writing computer schemes that translated languages like Mandarin, Irish, Xhosa, and some Native American languages into English, allowing people to learn the grammar for each language.\nAfter 19 years at the college, O’Kennon went on to retire from her full-time position as a professor and is now a Professor Emerita, still teaching Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chinese. She continued her work on writing web-based translators for less-commonly taught languages like, Xhosa, Ojibwe, Pulaar, and Quichua.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMartha O'Kennon's Nature Blog\nMathematics And Computer Science ― Faculty And Staff\nMartha O'Kennon's Research Gate Page",

        "content": "The Russian submarine Morzh (Russian: Морж, lit. 'walrus') was the lead ship of the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The submarine was laid down in August 1913 and was launched in September 1913, though it was not completed until April 1915. \nBuilt for the Black Sea Fleet, it saw action during World War I, notably by intercepting Turkish coal shipments between Constantinople and Zonguldak, and on one occasion nearly hitting the German cruiser Goeben with torpedoes. Morzh was lost at sea near the Bosporus in May 1917, most likely destroyed by a naval mine, making it the only submarine of its class to have been lost in combat. It was credited with sinking or capturing 30 ships during its career, for a total tonnage of 4,907 gross register tons (GRT).\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\n\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval-class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, having one deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1⁄2 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150 ft; 46 m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140 horsepower (850 kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190 kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30 km/h; 18 mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22 km/h; 14 mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three submarines began on 25 June 1911 and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was created specifically to build the Morzh class. Some of the components were made in Saint Petersburg before being sent to Nikolayev to be assembled. \nThe lead submarine of the class, Morzh, was launched in September 1913. Its engines were not installed until March 1915, and the sea trials were not complete until the end of April, at which point Morzh joined the Black Sea Fleet. This date made it the last boat in its class to be completed and enter service. At this point they were considered to be the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet.\n\n\n== World War I service ==\n\nAround the time that the submarine was completed in early 1915, the Black Sea Fleet had been ordered to attack the Bosporus in preparation for landing ground troops there in support of the British and the French during the Gallipoli campaign. The other two boats of its class, Nerpa and Tyulen, were already active with the rest of the fleet in blockading the Bosporus to prevent coal shipments between Constantinople and the coal producing region near Zonguldak, about 150 miles away. The German commanding admiral in the region, Wilhelm Souchon, thought that Russian submarines could potentially cut off the Ottoman Navy from its main supply of coal, though initially they did not have that much success. Morzh joined its sister ships in patrolling the waters near the Bosporus. In July 1915, it accompanied the submarine minelayer Krab, which was also recently completed, to the opening of the strait to lay naval mines for the German cruiser Goeben. Krab had some engine problems during the mission and had to be towed back to base by Morzh. \nIn August 1915 Morzh carried out patrols together with Tyulen, and on the 10th they attacked a supply convoy escorted by Goeben, the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye, and some Ottoman torpedo boats. Tyulen sank a large transport, and the next day both of them tried to attack Goeben, without success. Morzh continued targeting coal ships along the Anatolian coast over the next several months, and on 14 November 1915, it fired two torpedoes at Goeben that barely missed, while the cruiser was escorting some transports near the Bosporus. After this incident Souchon decided to stop using Goeben for the task of escorting merchant ships. The Russian naval attacks on the Bosporus in 1915 did not make a significant impact on the fighting in Gallipoli, but their campaign against coal shipping became a problem for the Ottomans.\nIn March 1916, the steamer Dubrovnik was torpedoed by Tyulen but still kept going, and it was finished off by Morzh. In May 1916, the submarine was damaged during an attack by a Turkish plane, and in June Morzh captured the Turkish sailing ship Belouzar, which was transporting oil. After the February Revolution in 1917, the Black Sea Fleet and its submarines continued to be active and the Russian Provisional Government intended to eventually land ground troops along the Anatolian coast. While on a patrol that took place in May 1917, Morzh was lost at sea with its entire crew, most likely from a mine near the Bosporus.\nMorzh carried out 19 patrols and was given credit for sinking or capturing 30 ships during the war, with a gross register tonnage of 4,907, which made it the third highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea after Tyulen and Narval.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Memorial ==\nThe wreck of Morzh was discovered in 2000.

During the First World War, he worked in the United States as a poster designer for the American war effort.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Turnhout, Jozef Paul Verrees studied architectural drawing at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen, NHISKA) from 1906 to 1908 under the direction of Juliaan De Vriendt (1842–1935) and Charles Mertens (1865–1919), as well as engraving in the workshop of Piet Verhaert, then in that of Frans Lauwers (1854–1931), who taught him the art of etching, where Verrees would prove himself remarkably gifted. Verrees worked alongside Lauwers until 1911. He collaborated with the Flemish newspaper Ons Volk Ontwaakt.\nIn May 1914, he presented his engravings at the triennial salon of the General Exhibition of Fine Arts at the Palais du Cinquantenaire in Brussels. After the start of the First World War, wounded during the first combats, he was evacuated to Scotland where he crossed paths with Frank Brangwyn. Verrees then left for the United States. He became known as an etcher by joining the Brooklyn Society of Etchers in 1915, as well as the Chicago Society of Etchers. He provides illustrations for American periodicals such as The Century Magazine and The Garden Magazine. From April 1917, recruited by the Division of Pictorial Publicity, he executed propaganda posters targeting Germany and serving to mobilize the American war effort (Join the Air Service and serve in France in 1917; What Are You Doing? Can Vegetables, Fruit and the Kaiser Too in 1918 for the National War Garden Commission). All his work is signed \"J. Paul Verrees\".\nAfter the war, he returned to Belgium, settled in Westmalle, and became professor and director in 1929 of the Turnhout art school. Verrees died in 1942.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

        "content": "Cullercoats Lifeboat Station is located on the north side of Cullercoats Harbour, in the town of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, in the county of Tyne and Wear.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS) in 1852, which became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1854.\nThe Cullercoats RNLI station currently operates a B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat Daddy's Girl (B-935), on station since 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1852, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, president of the RNIPLS, made funds available for the provision of a lifeboat at Cullercoats. A 36-foot long, 15-foot wide, stone-built boathouse was constructed, also at the expense of the Duke. A modified lifeboat, based on the prize-winning design of James Beeching, was created by James Peake, Master Shipwright at Woolwich Royal Naval Dockyard, and a carriage to transport the boat was designed by Col. Colquhoun, RA, Master-General of Ordnance. Both lifeboat and carriage arrived in Cullercoats on 3 September 1852, the boat being named Percy in honour of the Duke.\nBy 1858, Percy was found to be suffering from dry rot. A replacement 32-foot 10-oared Peake-class lifeboat was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing £174, and requiring a larger carriage, costing a further £80-5s-0d. Costs were again funded by the Duke of Northumberland, and the boat was once again named Percy.\nA replacement boathouse was constructed in 1866 to accommodate the larger 33-foot lifeboat Palmerston. Thirty years later, a third boathouse was constructed in 1896. A brick structure, it was built on the site of the 1866 boathouse, and cost £750. Funded by the Co-operative wholesale society, who had also funded a lifeboat Co-operator No.1 (ON 5) in 1884, it was opened on 8 August 1896 by Mr Tweedell, chairman of the Newcastle branch of the Society. It is still in use to this day, and is grade II listed by Historic England.\nThe era of Pulling and Sailing lifeboats (those with oars and sails) at Cullercoats came to an end in 1937, with the arrival of a Liverpool-class motor-powered lifeboat (which would also still have sails), the Richard Silver Oliver (ON 794). The boat had a single 35 hp engine, delivering a speed of 7.33 knots, and cost £3,684. After 85 years, this would also be the first non-self-righting lifeboat at Cullercoats, which 2 years later would prove very costly.\nOn a training exercise in 1939, the lifeboat was capsized off Sharpness Point. 6 crewmen were lost, including the Coxswain and the Honorary Secretary. The remaining crew refused to use another non-self-righting lifeboat, and the station was closed until the arrival of a self-righting boat in 1940.\nFollowing a coastal review in 1968, with All-weather lifeboats at flanking stations Blyth and Tynemouth, and with a D-class Inshore lifeboat at Cullercoats since 1965, the RNLI decided to withdraw the Cullercoats All-weather lifeboat. 37-08 Sir James Knott (ON 975) was formally withdrawn on 4 May 1969, being transferred to the Relief fleet, and then to Redcar in 1972. Over the following years, the D-class lifeboats would be replaced with a larger twin engine C-class lifeboat, and then in 1991, a B-class (Atlantic 21).\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Cullercoats.\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nAlexander Donkin, 1827\nThe Medal for this service was stolen and re-issued as a new Medal in 1833.\nJohn Redford, Coxswain - 1853\nAndrew Taylor, Coxswain - 1898\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nMajor William Adamson, Honorary Secretary - 1886\nBrian Gould, Helmsman - 1995\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 1996\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 2012\nThe Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award 1996(for the outstanding inshore lifeboat rescue of the year)\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 1997\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nMark Charlton, crew member - 1996\nDavid Pendlington, crew member - 1996\nRobert Oliver - 2010\nPeter Clark - 2010\nGrahame Wood - 2010\nGary Hawksford - 2010\nGrahame Wood, crew member - 2012\nStephen Potts, crew member - 2012\nExceptional First Aid Certificate\nRoss Dun, crew member - 2011\nGrahame Wood, crew member - 2011\nMember, Order of the British Empire (MBE)\nRaymond James Taylor, Honorary Secretary - 1995\nBritish Empire Medal\nGeoffrey Cowan, Community Safety Officer - 2020\n\n\n== Roll of honour ==\nIn memory of those lost whilst serving Cullercoats lifeboat.\n\nLiverpool-class lifeboat Richard Silver Oliver (ON 794), a non-self-righting lifeboat, capsized on exercise - 22 April 1939\nGeorge Brunton, Coxswain\nJ Redford Armstrong, Second Coxswain\nJ Leonard Abel, Motor Mechanic\nJohn Heddon Scott, Assistant Mechanic\nLt.

He worked as a public affairs adviser at Vereniging Natuurmonumenten, and he became a member of the Provincial Council of North Brabant in 2011, serving as GroenLinks's parliamentary leader. Smeulders left the council in 2014 to become alderman for finances, sustainability, and land in Helmond.\nHe did not secure a seat in the House of Representatives in the 2017 general election, but he was appointed to the body in June 2018 to succeed Linda Voortman. Smeulders lost his bid for re-election in 2021, bringing his membership of the House to an end on 30 March. He was appointed alderman for finances, housing, and refugees in Arnhem the following year after having formed the municipality's executive as (in)formateur. He announced in 2024 that Arnhem would house 1,700 asylum seekers for the next 30 years – 980 more than required by the national government – and he signaled that refugees were welcome.\n\n\n== References ==",

Benjamin Boykin became chair of the board and Catherine Parker Majority leader. Lohud attributed the major Democratic gains in heavily Democratic Westchester County as a reaction to the election of Donald Trump at the 2016 United States presidential election. The Democratic vote increased 6.71% as compared with the 2015 board of legislator elections.

        "content": "Alfonso Merry del Val y Zulueta, 1st Marquess of Merry del Val GCVO CvNSC (20 April 1864 – 27 May 1943) was a Spanish diplomat.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMerry del Val was born on 20 April 1864 at 59 Queen Anne Street in Marylebone, London. He was the eldest of four sons born to Sofía Josefa de Zulueta (1839–1925) and Rafael Carlos Merry del Val. Among his younger siblings, all of whom were born in London, was Rafael Merry del Val, who became Cardinal Secretary of State to Pope Pius X.  His father was a career diplomat who served as Spanish Ambassador to Belgium and to the Holy See and Minister at the Imperial Court of Vienna, and Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II and Kings Alfonso XII and Alfonso XII.\nHis father's family were descendants of a noble Irish family, originally from County Waterford, that settled in Seville in the 18th century. His maternal grandparents were Pedro José de Zulueta, 2nd Count of Torre Díaz, and the former Sophie Anne Willcox (daughter of Brodie McGhie Willcox, MP for Southampton). Through his maternal uncle, Brodie Manuel de Zulueta, 3rd Conde de Torre Díaz, he was a first cousin of Alfonso Maria de Zulueta, 4th Count of Torre Díaz. Through another uncle, Pedro Juan de Zulueta, he was a first cousin of Francisco Maria José de Zulueta, the Regius Professor of Civil Law at the University of Oxford.\nMerry del Val studied at various Jesuit colleges, first in Bournemouth, then at Beaumont College, until his family moved to Namur and Brussels in Belgium. In 1880 he entered the Catholic University of Louvain, graduating in 1884.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1882 he entered the diplomatic career during the Restoration, and his first assignment was in Brussels as an attaché to the embassy of which his father was head. In the early part of the 20th century, he taught English to the young King Alfonso XIII, then became his personal assistant. From then on, and throughout his life, he was closely affiliated with the King.\nIn 1908, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Tangier with the difficult task of resolving the conflicts caused by the activities of the Spanish Rif Mines Company and the claims of independence of Sultan Mulay Hafid. The failure of his mission and the subsequent outbreak of the Melilla War in 1909 brought instability to Spanish politics. After the events of the Tragic Week in Barcelona, the government of Prime Minister Antonio Maura fell, and Merry del Val was replaced by Luis Valera, the Marquess of Villasinda.\nHe was assigned again to Brussels, where he remained until April 1913 when he was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom, replacing the Marquess of Villa-Urrutia. His Anglophile tendencies and his familiarity with the British language, culture and high society greatly facilitated his mission at the Court of George V, marked by good relations between both monarchies. Following Irish independence in 1922, he negotiated the establishment of diplomatic relations between Spain and the new Irish Free State. He remained in London until he resigned in 1931, following the proclamation of the Second Republic after the deposition of King Alfonso XIII. He was replaced by the writer Ramón Pérez de Ayala, who was in favor with the new regime. He retired to Biarritz.\nIn 1936, at the outbreak of the Civil War, he left Spain and returned to London. In 1938, he negotiated with the British authorities the recognition of the Government at Burgos, acting alongside the Duke of Alba as unofficial representative of Gen. Francisco Franco. The Second Republic was eventually dissolved in 1939 after surrendering in the Spanish Civil War to the Nationalists led by Franco.\n\n\n=== Honours ===\nOn 16 March 1913, he was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. In 1925, King Alfonso XIII elevated him to the Peerage of Spain as the Marquess of Merry del Val. He was also made a Knight of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa by King Manuel II of Portugal, corresponding academician of the Royal Academy of History and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1901, Merry del Val married María de Alzola y González de Castejón (1879–1959) in Bilbao. She was a daughter of Don Pablo de Alzola y Minondo, a chamberlain to the King who was a member of the Senate of Spain, and María de las Mercedes González de Castejón y Torre. While in England, Maria was a friend of diarist Henry Channon. Together, they were the parents of two children:\n\nAlfonso Merry del Val y Alzola, 2nd Marquess of Merry del Val (1903–1975), who was also a diplomat serving as the Spanish Ambassador to the United States and Japan; he married his cousin, María del Carmen de Gurtubay y Alzola, Marchioness of Yurreta y Gamboa. They divorced and he married Mercedes de Ocio y Ureta.\nPablo Merry del Val y Alzola, the Chief Liaison Officer for the foreign press under Franco; he married María Melgarejo y Heredia.\nThe Marquess died on 27 May 1943 in San Sebastián.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAlfonso Merry del Val y Zulueta (1864-1943), Spanish ambassador to England at the National Portrait Gallery, London",

It involves categorizing variables not merely as associated with each other but specifically as causes and effects. Causal thinking is distinct from correlational thinking, which is common in statistical analysis. For example, from a causal perspective, the independent variable in linear regression is considered the 'cause,' while the dependent variable is considered the 'effect.' In contrast, from a correlational perspective, the two variables are associated with each other and are thus interchangeable.",

She had initially planned to become a doctor but instead studied journalism in Germany. While there, she worked for Voice of Germany in Cologne.\nShe then returned to Haiti, where the news environment was opening slightly after the death of dictator François Duvalier She spent ten years reporting for Radio Métropole in Port-au-Prince.\nIn 1980, Etheart was detained and then expelled by the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier along with many of her journalist colleagues. She settled in Miami and continued her work as a journalist there. Beginning in 1982, she and her longtime collaborator Marcus Garcia broadcast the news show \"Chita Tande\" in Haitian Creole on WLRN-FM. Also with Garcia, in 1986, she co-founded the newspaper Haïti en Marche, which became a trusted source for members of the Haitian diaspora. Etheart served as co-editor of the publication. Due to this work, she was described as one of the \"most trusted Haitian journalists in the diaspora.\" In 1990, she was awarded a Maria Moors Cabot Prize.\nIn the late 1990s, Etheart was able to return to Haiti and work as a journalist in Port-au-Prince. While there, she helped establish the station Radio Mélodie.\nUntil his death in 2024, she was married to the sociologist Emmanuel Bernard Etheart, with whom she had two children.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Virginia Prewett (1919 – April 7, 1988) was a U.S. journalist whose writing focused on Latin American affairs.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVirginia Prewett was born in Gordonsville, Tennessee, in 1919. She spent her teenage years living in Spain, then studied at Cumberland University, the University of Toulouse, and New York University.\nIn the 1940s, after beginning her career as a reporter at the Nashville Tennessean and Lebanon Banner, she became a foreign correspondent in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico for the Chicago Sun and Sun-Times, with her writing widely syndicated through the publication's news service. She also worked briefly on Latin American issues for the International Rescue Committee in the late '40s.\nPrewett went on to cover Latin America on a freelance basis for a variety of publications, including the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Atlantic, New Republic, Herald Tribune, Reader's Digest, Saturday Evening Post, and Washington Times. From 1959 into the 1960s, she wrote a syndicated North American Newspaper Alliance column. Then, in the '60s and '70s, she wrote a column for the Washington Daily News. After moving to Washington, D.C., in 1966, she spent 18 years producing \"The Hemisphere Hotline,\" a newsletter focusing on inter-American affairs.\nShe was the author of three books, beginning with Reportage on Mexico (1941). This was followed by The Americas and Tomorrow in 1944. In the early 1950s, Prewett temporarily left journalism and attempted to establish a farm in the forests of Brazil. This experience resulted in her 1953 memoir Beyond the Great Forest. \nFor her coverage of Latin America, she received a Maria Moors Cabot Prize in 1964.\nPrewett, described by some as a conservative journalist, was a co-founder of the Citizens Committee for a Free Cuba. She was honored for her work by the Brazilian and Guatemalan governments, for her opposition to Juan Perón and Fidel Castro, respectively. \nIn 1949, she married William R. Mizelle, becoming Virginia Prewett Mizelle, but she continued to write under her maiden name.\nShe died in 1988 at age 69.\n\n\n== References ==",

According to John D. Grainger, they were built or acquired by Nerva to better stock the public annona (public grain supply), and since Vespasian and Domitian did the same, he presumes that this was part of a continuous program of improvement or replacement of old warehouses.\nThe Hórreos de Nerva are known only from a single mention in a sepulchral inscription. They can probably be identified with the Hórreos dos Césares mentioned in a law found, but not in situ, inside the Porta Salária. Samuel Ball Platner, while also considering this possibility, states that the Hórreos dos Césares may also be associated with the Hórreos de Galba.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

The club competed in Division Four, as well as the League Cup, FA Cup and Welsh Cup.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHereford ended the 1971–72 Southern League season  as runners-up, two points behind champions Chelmsford City. They also reached the final of the Southern League Cup and enjoyed a run to the fourth round of the FA Cup which included a famous win over Newcastle United that put the club in the national spotlight. Hereford applied for election to the Football League and were duly voted in at the expense of Barrow.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nHereford made their league bow in a 1–0 defeat away to Colchester United. The following weekend, Kenny Wallace scored their first league goal in a 3–0 home win over Reading, although the honour of Hereford's first scorer in a competitive match as a league club went to George Johnston in a midweek League Cup defeat to Aston Villa.\nAfter 14 matches, Hereford had notched up only one further win and lay 21st in the division, but in their next two matches, they doubled their tally by beating Northampton Town and leaders Mansfield Town. This started a 14 match unbeaten run that saw Hereford surge up the table to become promotion contenders. They maintained this good form, losing only three of their last 17 matches, but still needed at least a point from their final match against Crewe Alexandra to guarantee promotion. In the event, Hereford managed a 1–0 win courtesy of a goal by David Jenkins.\nHereford's average home crowd of nearly 9000 was the highest in the Fourth Division (Reading's 5521 being the next highest) and higher than all bar six clubs from the Third Division. They lost only once at Edgar Street and dropped just a single point from their last 17 home matches.\nThis was the only season at the club for goalkeeper David Icke. Despite suffering from rheumatoid arthritis which would force him to quit the game at the age of 21, Icke kept 18 clean sheets in 37 league appearances and did not once feature on the losing side at home.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nPlayers who made one appearance or more for Hereford United F.C. during the 1972-73 season\n\n\n== Fourth Division ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Second Division ===\n\n\n=== League Cup ===\n\n\n=== FA Cup ===\n\n\n=== Welsh Cup ===\n\n* Match played at Edgar Street after Merthyr Tydfil chose to waive home rights.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\nParrott, Ron (1998).

        "content": "The Battles for Murzuch, or the Reconquest of Fezzan, was a series of operations in the region today known as Fezzan. Italian soldiers and local fighters fought for who would have control over the region and the city of Murzuch, and the Italians were eventually victorious.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHaving appointed general Emilio De Bono as Minister of the Colonies in January 1929, the two Libyan colonies (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica) were reunited under a single governor, marshal Pietro Badoglio. He began his governance by launching a proclamation to the populations which remained among the rebel ranks to choose between submission to the Government or execution. At the same time, he based his action on the principle «to pacify the colonies it is essential first of all to occupy the entire country».\nClashes occurred in Umm Melah, in the far north of Fezzan, where a large enemy garrison was destroyed and, in May, towards Bir Sciueref, where another large group of rebels suffered the same fate. At the end of May 1929, the overall situation in Tripolitania now allowed the Governor to prepare operations for the establishment of control over Fezzan.\n\n\n== Campaign preparations and first clashes ==\nAfter the spring 1929 operations in Ghibla, many rebel groups had taken refuge in Fezzan, headed in the western part by Salem en Nebi and Mohammed ben Hassel and in the eastern part by the Seif en Nasser brothers. Marshal Badoglio's plan was to advance into Fezzan with the following concept:\n\n (in Italian) \"Affrontare e liquidare successivamente, uno alla volta, sempre quando possibile, i vari nuclei in cui appariva frazionato l’avversario, e sempre in condizioni di avere il sopravvento anche nel caso sfavorevole che il nemico riuscisse ad opporci una massa unica.\"\nThe logistical preparation was based on the assumption of the complete occupation of Fezzan: the main base was located at the entrance to Fezzan, in Hon (Wadi al Shatii District), the three subsidiary bases were in Gheriat, Bir esc-Sciueref and Derg (Jabal al Gharbi District). These bases were supposed to aid the units during their concentration and provide them, upon departure, with the necessary means for a month's autonomy. Road communications up to the bases were improved, so as to make them suitable for the transit of vehicles. The gathering in Sciueref took place secretly in November. On 25 November General Graziani assumed command of the troops which were formed as follows:\n\nColumn of the Sciueref led by Amedeo D'Aosta made up of:\n1st Saharan group (two Saharan groups and a Saharan artillery section), under the orders of lieutenant Ferrari Orsi;\n2nd Saharan group (formation like the previous one), under the orders of lieutenant Amato.\nThe column was to be followed by a caravan of 700 camels, with portions of the various services, two months of food and 17 days of water for the 260 kilometers of desert to be overcome.\n\nEastern column led by colonel Cubeddu made up of a self-supported Eritrean battalion, an armored machine gun squadron and a maneuver group (286 trucks) to constitute the future Brak base;\nDerg column led by lieutenant Colonel Moramarco made up of a Saharan group, a Meharist nucleus, a Saharan artillery section and adequate logistical elements.\nOn the command banner was the motto: «Usque ad finem» (in Latin: Until the End).\n\nThe Sciueref column arrived in Brak on 5 December after crossing 265 kilometers of desert without any incident: the inhabitants of Brak made an act of submission to general Amedeo. The Italians found and arranged the tomb of captain De Dominicis, who fell in Maharuga fifteen years earlier. In Brak the Italians left a military garrison entrusted to colonel Natale.\n\n\n== Battle for Murzuch, Brak and Sebha ==\nAfter the occupations of Brak and Sebha, on 14 December, by colonel Cubeddu and of the oasis of Umm el Araneb and Uau el Kebir by generals Graziani and Badoglio, respectively on 8 January 1930 and on 13 January 1830, troops led by Amedeo D'Aosta, after a light battle, successfully occupied Murzuch. The operations in Fezzan finally ended when Italian soldiers reached the Chad–Libya border on 20 February 1930, and raised colonial flags on centres like Tummo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGrand, Alexander de (May 2004). \"Mussolini's Follies: Fascism in Its Imperial and Racist Phase, 1935-1940\".

        "content": "The 1921–22 Amherst Lord Jeffs men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program. The Lord Jeffs were coached by Leon Plumer in his first season.\n\n\n== Season ==\n\nWith a new moniker for the college's team (unofficial as it may be), Amherst wasted no time in preparing for the season. Seeking to banish the memory of a winless season, the team used an uncommon tactic of employing an undergrad as the team's coach. To make things interesting, Leon Plumer was not a member of the team, though he had been two years earlier. Plumer ran the Jeffs through drills whenever possible on the temporary rink but there was little chance to prepare for the inaugural match right after they returned from the winter break. Among other things, Amherst officially adopted the new 6-on-6 format and abandoned the rover position.\nIn the first match, Dartmouth was once again one of the best teams in the country and the purple did well just by keeping the score close. A week later the team took a jaunt through upstate New York and came away with two more defeats. The match with Hamilton showed some improvement with the team, however, the second game was a bit of a clunker and the Jeff lost 0–4.\nAt the time the weather was being kind and allowed the ice on Pratt Field to solidify into a fast sheet. The team got as much practice in as they could ahead of the next game and everything seemed to come together when they hosted YMCA College. Worcester was moved to center for the game which helped spur the best game for Amherst since the war. The Purple trounced the Maroons 5–0 and ended their 10-game losing streak in the process. A week later the team was widely outplayed by Massachusetts Agricultural, however, Plimpton was the star of the game and stopped 50 shots in 42 minutes of action. Unfortunately, their goaltender's heroics went for naught as the Jeffmen were beaten, 0–1.\nAmherst's home stand concluded with a pair of wins over Bates and YMCA and set up a two-game series with Williams. The Ephs welcomed Amherst with one of the longest games in program history, playing three 20-minute periods rather than the then-customary 15-minute frames. The extra time didn't help the Lord Jeffs as Amherst was unable to scor in the game, though Plimpton did post another remarkable effort in the loss. The rematch saw the Purple offense show its teeth and two goals from captain Worcester led Amherst to the win.\nThe final game of the season was a rematch with the Mass. Aggies and was a near carbon-copy of the first. Plimpton was once more singled out for his stellar play, credited with remarkable stickwork, though not called upon nearly as much as he had been. Unfortunately, the offense was just as inept in the final game and Amherst could not get a single puck into the MAC cage. The final score was eerily similar as well with the Purples losing 0–1 to end the season. While the end wasn't what they had hoped for, the Jeffmen had done a far sight better than they had in '21 and posted their best season in over a decade.\nRussell F. Neale served as team manager with William F. Whitla as his assistant.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pedro José de Zulueta y Madariaga, 2nd Count of Torre Díaz (18 October 1809 – 3 March 1882) was a Spanish politician and aristocrat who became a banker in London.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nZulueta was born in Cádiz, Andalucía on 18 October 1809. He was the eldest son of Josefa Madariaga Ceballos (a daughter of Juana Josefa Ceballos) and Spanish merchant and deputy in the Spanish Cortes, Don Pedro Juan de Zulueta (1784–1855), who was created the 1st Count of Torre Díaz by Queen Isabella II of Spain in 1846. Among his siblings was brother Antonio de Zulueta.\nThe de Zulueta family was an ancient Catholic Basque family from the Pamplona region of Northern Spain, who trace their genealogical ancestry back at the least by 700 years including participating in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, an important turning point in the Reconquista and the medieval history of Spain. When the government collapsed in 1823, the Zulueta family was among liberal exiles who went to London where his father established the trading house of Zulueta & Co. in 1823, becoming an agent of rthe Spanish Government.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter the slaves in Haiti were freed in 1794 following the French Revolution, the slave owners settled in Cuba where slavery boomed at the beginning of the 19th century. His father's firm, Zulueta & Co., was involved along with his cousin, Julián de Zulueta, 1st Marquis of Álava, before the slave trade was abolished there as well in 1825.\nAfter King Ferdinand VII's death in 1833, his father was back in favour in Spain and was made Count of Torre Díaz in 1846. De Zulueta was a chamberlain and Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz, the King consort of Spain, and a member of the Senate of Spain until the Revolution in 1868. After the Glorious Revolution, he established the London bank of Zulueta & Co.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1836, de Zulueta was married to Sophie Anne Willcox, a daughter of Brodie McGhie Willcox, MP for Southampton. Together, they lived at 21 Devonshire Place, London and were the parents of:\n\nSofía Josefa de Zulueta (1839–1925), who married Rafael Carlos Merry del Val, Marquess of Merry del Val, secretary to the Spanish legation in London, who was a monarchist supporter of Alfonso XII.\nBrodie Manuel de Zulueta, 3rd Conde de Torre Díaz (1842–1918), who married Constance Petre, a daughter of the Hon. Frederick Petre (a son of the 11th Baron Petre), in 1873. After her death, he married Hon. Bertha Clifford, a daughter of Charles Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, in 1892.\nPedro Juan José de Zulueta (c. 1847–1908), a diplomat who married Laura Sheil, a daughter of Sir Justin Sheil.\nFrancisco de Zulueta, a Jesuit priest.\nThe Count of Torre Díaz died on 3 March 1882 in London. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Brodie.\n\n\n=== Descendants ===\nThrough his eldest daughter Sofía, he was a grandfather of four, including Alfonso Merry del Val, Marquess of Merry del Val (1864–1943), who became the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Rafael Merry del Val (1865–1930), who became Cardinal Secretary of State.\nThrough his eldest son Brodie, he was a grandfather of Alfonso Maria de Zulueta, 4th Count of Torre Díaz (1874–1951); Inés de Zulueta; Dolores de Zulueta and Angela de Zulueta.\nThrough his son Pedro Juan, he was a grandfather of Francisco Maria José de Zulueta (1878–1958), the Regius Professor of Civil Law at the University of Oxford from 1919 until 1948.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Trial of Pedro Jose de Zulueta in London for Trading in Slaves  In: Hugh Thomas: The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade: 1440 - 1870.

Audrey Diwan's Emmanuelle was later revealed to be the festival's opening film, as well as part of the official selection's competitive lineup. 2023 Donostia Award winner Javier Bardem is expected to receive the award in 2024, as the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike prevented him from attending the 71st festival. On 9 May 2024, the festival's organization unveiled the official poster for the 72nd edition; it features Donostia Award winner Cate Blanchett and it was designed by José Luis Lanzagorta based on a black and white photograph by Gustavo Papaleo.\n\n\n== Sections ==\n\n\n=== Official selection ===\n\n\n==== In competition ====\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Donostia Award ===\nCate Blanchett\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Calvary Lutheran Church is an historic church on the National Register of Historic Places in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The church was built in 1930 with an addition built in 1953. The church is an exemplary work of the prolific Minneapolis architectural firm of Lang and Raugland. The church is located one block south of George Floyd Square.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe congregation was founded in 1923. The church initially separated from Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church in Saint Paul due to a desire to have more English language services. The architects, Lang and Raugland, specialized in the Gothic Revival style and designed both the 1930 church and the 1953 school building. A parking lot was consructed behind the church in the 1950s in place of several homes. A food shelf run by the church has operated since the 1980s.\nBy the 2020s, the church had over a million dollars in deferred maintenance and limited funds to do repairs. The church decided to sell the building to a non-profit housing developer in 2021 in a unanimous vote. The total cost to renovate the existing buildings and construct a new apartment building on the former parking lot was $23.5 million.  The church space is used as a community area for residents during the week while the church rents the space to use for worship on Sundays. 20 units are located in the new building and 21 units are located in the historic school building. Every unit is considered deeply affordable which means the units are affordable for those making 30% of the area median income, about $33,000 for a family of three. The units are a mix of 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedrooms. Every unit was leased within two weeks of the completion of construction.\n\n\n== References ==",

The story centers on the trials of Dedan Kimathi, a Kenyan national hero who resisted colonialism in Kenya, and the pressure put on him to disclose his allies to the colonial authorities.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKimathi is captured and the colonial authorities say they will put him on trial. In his first trial, Kimathi meets with Shaw Henderson. During the meeting, Kimathi is told he will be released if he pleas for his life, but he rejects the offer. In his second trial, Kimathi meets with a delegation. A banker in the delegation argues that Kenya's economy grew under the colonial government, which Kimathi refutes. In his third trial, Kimathi meets with a priest, a businessman and a politician, who all tempt him to surrender. Kimathi is briefly swayed, but rejects their offer. In the four trial, Kimathi meets with Shaw Henderson again. Henderson tortures Kimathi in an attempt to get him to reveal the identities of his fellow revolutionist, but Kimathi refuses and eventually dies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Janaki Sthan ( Sanskrit: जानकी स्थान ) is a historical place related to the temple of Goddess Sita in the city of Sitamarhi. According to some scholars and Saints, Janaki Sthan is claimed to be the manifestation place of Goddess Sita in Ramayana. This is a temple dedicated to the Goddess Sita called Janaki Sthan Mandir. This temple is about 2 kilometers away from Sitamarhi Railway Station. The temple comes under Ramanuja tradition in Hinduism.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Janaki Sthan Mandir at Janaki Sthan in Sitamarhi is much older than the Janaki Temple in Janakpur. According to a court document, in 1599, land of Janaki Sthan was donated to the Janaki temple in Sitamarhi city by the King Narpati Singh of Raj Darbhanga. Its founder is believed to be Hiraram Das of Revasa Math of Rajasthan. But according to a case filed in Patna High Court in 1923 regarding this Math, the name of its first Mahant was Hiram and he was said to be a resident of Misraula village of Shahabad.\n\n\n== Disputes between Janaki Sthan and Punauradham ==\nSince the British era, there has been a controversy over the manifestation ( birth ) place of Goddess Sita. Some scholars say that the birthplace of Goddess Sita is Janaki Sthan located in Sitamarhi city and some scholars say that Punauradham is the birthplace of the Goddess Sita. On the both places there are Janaki temples as well as Kunds. The Kund at Punauradham is called as Sita Kund or Janaki Kund and the Kund at Janaki Sthan is called as Urvija Kund. According to Mahant Vinod Das, Janaki Sthan is the manifestation place of the Goddess Sita. There was a tradition of Guru-Shishya at this place. After the death of Guru, Shishya was assigned as Mahant. After the death of a certain Mahant during British India, two of his disciples clashed for claiming to be the Mahant of the temple. Even the initiative of the local saints could not resolve the issue. It is said that the matter went to court. The Privy Council of London gave verdicted in the favour of Janaki Sthan as the manifestation place of Goddess Sita. Then the second disciple went to Pundarik Ashram at Punauradham and built a temple there. This temple at the Pundarik Ashram later became Ram Janaki Mandir. It is said that sage Pundarik had an ashram in Punaura. He used to meditate here. In the 19th century, the Birla Group wanted to renovate the Janaki Sthan Mandir, but the then Mahant did not allow this to happen fearing that the temple would be named Birla Mandir. Then Birla's team reached Punauradham and renovated the Ram Janaki Mandir there.\n\n\n== References ==",

Two 'Robin-Hood' YouTubers, Thea and Louise, decide to pose as caterers on a 'arty' commercial so that they can steal equipment and give it to the needy, all whilst filming themselves doing it of course. When they arrive at the Welsh mansion, however, they find the place deserted and only from the behind the scenes footage shot by the film crew as proof they were there - but is the horrific footage they find real or fake? Have they stepped into a prank, or the worst day of their life!\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRiz Moritz as Louise\nEllie Duckles as Thea\nMatt Barber as Matt\nTori Butler-Hart as Tori\nEmma King as Emma\nGraham Butler as Gray\nHattie Chapman as Hattie\nLuca Thompson as Ash Blake\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released in cinemas on 9 February 2024 and released on digital platforms on 2 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. Jack Bottomley of Starburst Magazine called it as a \"tense, slow-burning, slice of British folk horror\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDagr at IMDb",

He spends his free time with his friend Roman at discotheques. During one night out, he meets an attractive blonde, Eva, and a quiet hairdresser, Jitka. Jirka falls in love with Eva, though Eva already has a boyfriend, the slightly older Cáfa. In an effort to win Eva over and prove that he is better than Cáfa, Jirka does silly things such as running around the town square naked, kissing Eva in front of a security camera, and inviting Cáfa to a luxury restaurant and sneaking out with Eva before payment.\nJirka eventually loses Eva after she discovers he was lying to her about being an airplane mechanic. Distraught, Jirka gets his head shaved by Jitka. Cáfa also beats up Jirka after Jirka did not pay back the restaurant bill. Afterwards, Jirka has an argument with his father and runs away from home. Jirka lives as a vagrant, secretly entering his house to get food, but he is eventually discovered by his father and the two reconcile. Jirka also realizes that Jitka, not Eva, really likes him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRudolf Hrušínský III as Jirka\nLadislav Potměšil as Jirka's father\nMariana Slováková as Eva\nJaroslava Stránská as Jitka\nRoman Pikl as Roman\nAndrej Kraus as Cáfa\nJana Krausová as Jirka's mother\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nA sequel, Discopříběh 2, was released in 1991.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscopríbeh at IMDb",

        "content": "Sharon Dolev is a peace and human rights activist focusing on eliminating weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East. She does this through innovations in education, advocacy and activism to change public policies. She is the founder and director of the Israeli Disarmament Movement (IDM) and a co-founder and executive director of the Middle East Treaty Organization (METO). She also worked for a time with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nDolev began working for Greenpeace in Israel in 2007. \nIn October 2022, she was elected to the Council of the International Peace Bureau (IPB) for her advocacy of eradicating \"nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East through innovative policy, education, advocacy and activism.\" \n\n\n== Israeli disarmament movement ==\nDolev is the founder of the Israeli Disarmament Movement, a constituent member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Critics of her work have asked her \"not to speak,\" because they think her work \"is putting Israel in danger.\" She was asked, \"What is it like to be a woman and do this work, especially in the Middle East and in such a militaristic Israeli culture?\" She replied, \"I am taking part in various meetings ... . It takes time until my position is even considered a legit one to talk about. This is both because I am a woman and because I am talking about the impossible. My biggest frustration is organizing panels that I myself would boycott because there is no representation for women. This frustration always exists. When will I stop being a woman and start being someone who talks about nuclear weapons?\" \nIn 2010, the Palestine-Israel Journal featured an article by Dolev on \"Creating an Anti-Nuclear Movement in Israel\". This article describes \"a new Israeli grassroots anti-nuclear movement\" and a series of events they organized in Israel on this topic. However, this 2010 article did not provide a name for this movement.\nIn 2016 the Israeli Disarmament Movement and 100 citizens of Israel petitioned Israel's High Court of Justice \"to compel the secretive Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) to become more transparent through broad Knesset legislation.\" The Jerusalem Post quoted Dolev as having said, \"The ambiguity typifying the work of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission has become dangerous in itself for Israeli citizens.\" The petitioners included Avner Cohen, a leading expert on Israel's nuclear program. He said that the petitioners had been working on this for roughly a year and filed it \"only weeks after\" numerous reports appeared in the press \"that the reactor southeast of Dimona has 1,537 cracks.\" The petitioners agreed that some secrecy was required, but the IAEC should nevertheless be subject to some oversight by the Knesset.\nA 12 October 2017 publication by the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) said, 'the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, in conjunction with the British American Security Information Council (BASIC), hosted a panel discussion entitled, “A Draft Treaty for a WMD Free Zone in the Middle East: Time to Envisage the Practical.”  The speakers included ... Sharon Dolev of BASIC in Israel and founder/director of the Israeli Disarmament Movement (IDM)\".\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nYermi Brenner (2 October 2013). \"Questioning Israel's nuclear ambiguity policy\".

        "content": "Eloína Suárez Suárez (November 1922 – 2 May 2024) was a Spanish politician. She was the mayor of Oviedo from 1978 to 1979, and as of her death, was the only woman to hold the office. She was the first woman to be mayor of a provincial capital in Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSuárez was born in Oviedo, Asturias, to parents who owned a grocery. Her mother was also a teacher in Mieres and taught miners to read.\nSuárez married Alfonso Fuertes, a law professor, with whom she had six children. After his death at age 37 in 1959, she took over her parents' business. After seeing similar shops in France, she made the family shop into the first self-service one in Oviedo. She studied business management by night. The business was shut down when its building was demolished.\nOn 7 February 1971, Suárez took a seat on Oviedo city council, as the only woman in the administration. Mayor Félix Serrano González-Solares stood down due to illness and was succeeded by his first deputy, Higinio Rodríguez Pérez, who resigned. Suárez then succeeded him in June 1978, serving until Luis Riera Posada was elected in the first democratic elections in April 1979. In Asturias, these elections did not result in a single female mayor, the first being María del Mar Suárez in Ribera de Arriba upon her predecessor's resignation in 1981.\nSuárez died in Oviedo on 2 May 2024, at the age of 101. At the time of her death, she had five living children, ten grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren. Her son Miguel Fuertes Suárez (born 1951) was Spain's ambassador in Greece and Serbia. Her 102-year-old sister also attended her funeral.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Herbert Abraham Gill (October 12, 1856 – November 27, 1936) was an American civil servant, auditor, stenographer, and businessman. Gill served as the acting commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1895 to 1896. He was also the founder and president of H.A. Gill & Son Inc., a real estate development company in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nGill was born on October 12, 1856, in New York City. He was married to Monita Wederstrandt Smith and they had four children.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== United States Fish Commission ===\nIn the late 1870s, Gill began working for the Smithsonian Institution as a stenographer, and began working for the United States Fish Commission in May 1876 as a disbursing agent and auditing officer. In the 1880s, Gill was appointed as chief clerk of the commission. In 1880, Gill helped to plan the U.S. government's involvement in the Berlin Fishery Expedition. In 1890, Gill testified to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries during their investigation of the commission.\nFollowing the death of Commissioner Marshall McDonald in 1895, Gill assumed the role of Acting Commissioner. Gill served in the post until the appointment of John J. Brice the following year. While in the post, Gill helped to establish the commission's Division of Propagation and Distribution of Food Fishes. He also worked with the U.S. Congress to regulate Alaskan salmon fishing with closed seasons, spawning escapement requirements, and net restrictions.\n\n\n=== Business career ===\nGill was an active member of the Cosmos Club from 1879 to 1884. In 1888, Gill began buying and selling land in Brookland, a new suburban development in Washington, D.C. During that period, he acquired over forty land deeds and began developing properties. In 1892, he sold his land in Rosemount Park to the U.S. government for $1 to help establish Rock Creek Park.\nIn 1908, he formally established H.A. Gill & Son Inc. with his son Theodore. In 1917, Gill was a founding board member of the Washington Real Estate Board to institute standard real estate fees and a code of ethics. Gill was also the auditor of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for several years.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGill died in 1936 aged 80. He is interred at Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

At the request of FELAP and the International Federation of Journalists, in 1991 the Commission for the Investigation of Attacks Against Journalists was founded as a regional body working to ensure the safety of FELAP members.\nIn addition to its official website, FELAP has published articles on the website of the Voltaire Network. It is associated with UNESCO as a nongovernmental organization. It has worked in collaboration with many organizations, including the Argentine Media Observatory, the Union of Journalists of Buenos Aires, the Puerto Rico Journalists Association, the Chilean College of Journalists, the Brazilian National Federation of Journalists, the Federation of Associations of Mexican Journalists, and Democracy Now. Representatives from FELAP have served on the jury for the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFELAP on Twitter\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Underdark are a British black metal band from Nottingham, England, formed in 2015 by guitarists Ollie Jones and Adam Kinson and drummer Dan Hallam. The band's current lineup consists of Jones, Kinson, bassist Stephen \"Stig\" Waterfield, vocalist Abi Vasquez and drummer Daniel Blackmore. The band's sound has been categorized under the \"post-black metal\" label. The band's anti-fascist beliefs, which they have held since their inception, have led to them being associated with the \"anti-fascist black metal\" and Red and Anarchist Black Metal (RABM) movements, although they do not consider themselves to be a \"political band\".\nUnderdark released their debut EP, Mourning Cloak (2016), with original vocalist Max Speelman. Speelman quit the band was replaced by Vasquez shortly after the recording of its debut album, Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry, in 2019; the album was not released until 2021 due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their second album and first with Blackmore, Managed Decline, was released through Church Road Records on 24 November 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early releases (2015–2018) ===\nUnderdark were formed in 2015 when guitarists Ollie Jones and Adam Kinson (of Statutes) approached drummer Dan Hallam (of Castaway) about the possibility of starting a black metal band \"similar to Deafheaven with scream influences such as Envy\". The members all came from \"hardcore or hardcore-adjacent\" musical backgrounds; Hallam had little-to-no experience with black metal prior to joining the band. They then recruited vocalist Max Speelman, whom they had seen perform live once, before recruiting bassist Stephen \"Stig\" Waterfield. The band takes its name from the Funeral Diner album The Underdark (2005). \nThe band's music started off as \"purely Deafheaven and Envy worship\", according to Hallam, and gradually began experimenting with more atmospheric textures drawn from post-rock and post-metal. In 2016, the band self-released their debut EP, Mourning Cloak, which was distributed through the DIY record labels Adorno, Slime Citadel, Third-I-Rex and Sell Your Soul. Underdark toured heavily throughout 2017, including a weekender tour with Nihility. In February 2018, the band released a split 7\" single with Antre, which entered the top-selling black metal chart on Bandcamp. In July 2018, the band embarked on their first European tour, before playing on the \"New Blood\" stage of the Bloodstock Open Air festival in August.\n\n\n=== Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry (2019–2022) ===\nUnderdark began writing their debut album, Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry, in 2018. It was initially planned as an EP but was expanded into an album over the course of a year. The band recorded, mixed and mastered the album in January 2019. Not long after its recording, however, Speelman quit Underdark. \"There were too many conflicting ideals and it all came to a head at one point and we just parted ways\", Hallam said. The band were nevertheless \"gutted\" by his exit and briefly considered breaking up, but decided to continue \"cause we've worked so hard towards it.\" They soon began advertising for a new vocalist, and in June 2019, recruited Abi Vasquez, formerly of Yuri. Vasquez, who had been on a hiatus from music due to surgery before auditioning for Underdark, first met most of the band's members whilst she was working as a booking agent in Leicester; Hallam had also played shows with Yuri when he was in an emo band. Underdark announced Vasquez's addition to their line-up in September 2019, hours before her first performance with the band. Vasquez was made to re-record the album's vocals with her own lyrics, over the band's already completed music. Afterwards, the band had the album remixed and remastered. \nUnderdark had again finished Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry by March 2020, but were forced to delay its release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 30 October 2020, the band released a limited edition cassette single, featuring a cover of The Cure's \"Plainsong\" and a re-recording of Mourning Cloak track \"With Bruised and Bloodied Feet\", as a way of introducing Vasquez and the direction of their forthcoming debut album to the public. It was released through Surviving Sounds in Europe and Red Nebula in North America, and limited to 50 copies per label. On 11 May 2021, Underdark announced that Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry would be released on 30 July 2021. The band signed with three record labels to distribute the album; Surviving Sounds in the United Kingdom, Through Love in Europe and Tridroid in North America. The album received positive reviews from critics. Underdark embarked on a small tour of the United Kingdom following its release, and played one-off shows opening for Dawn Ray'd and Conan. In March 2022, Underdark and Mountain Caller supported Svalbard on select dates of their UK tour for that month. The band were due to perform at Cult of Luna's Beyond the Redshift Festival in London that same month, but it was postponed.\n\n\n=== Managed Decline (2023–present) ===\nTowards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Underdark began working on new material. By July 2021, they had completed half of the writing for their second album. Towards the end of writing, Hallam left Underdark and was replaced by Dan Blackmore. In the winter of 2022, the band recorded Managed Decline with producer Joe Clayton at Nø Studio in Manchester. It is a concept album, detailing the long-term effects of Thatcherite neo-liberalism on a post-industrial town in the Midlands across three generations. Jones said that the events detailed in its lyrics were based on \"an amalgamation of accounts\" from people Vasquez interviewed about their experiences in post-industrial towns. On 5 July 2023, the band announced they had signed with Church Road Records and released a cover of Massive Attack's \"Unfinished Sympathy\". The band released Managed Decline through the label on 24 November 2023. It received similar acclaim to their debut, with Metal Hammer naming it one of the best black metal albums of 2023. Around the time of its release, Underdark went on tour supporting Cruelty. In August 2024, the band will perform at the ArcTanGent and Core. festivals.\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nUnderdark have been described as black metal, post-metal, and \"post-black metal\". Their sound incorporates elements of shoegaze, post-rock, post-punk, blackgaze, screamo, and post-hardcore. Jones has said that the members of Underdark do not consider genre when writing music, instead trying to \"write what we want to hear\". Whilst they were influenced by black metal's aesthetics, he does not consider the band to be black metal \"necessarily\" due to the band's diverse range of influences. The band's musical influences include Alcest, City of Caterpillar, Cradle of Flith, Dawn Ray'd, Deafheaven, Deftones, Envy, Mogwai, Pig Destroyer, This Will Destroy You, and Weakling.\nLyrically, Vasquez has stated that she \"very much [writes] about real shit, whether it's personal or something that affects people on a wider scale\". She prefers to write songs as a longform narrative, and the lengthy nature of Underdark's songs allows her to discuss and research her topics in depth. The writing of Our Bodies Burned Bright On Re-Entry was more \"fragmented\" and personal than her previous output, addressing the attempted suicide of one of her close friends, her struggles with drug addiction, the Mexico–United States border, the Grenfell Tower fire and her fears of burnout. When writing lyrics for the album, she was listening to Dessa, Sadistik and 070 Shake. She cited Kendrick Lamar as an influence on her storytelling in Managed Decline.\n\n\n== Political views ==\nSince their inception, the members of Underdark have held anti-fascist beliefs and have been associated with the \"anti-fascist black metal\" movement against National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM), which emerged in the mid-2010s. The band have also been associated with the Red and Anarchist Black Metal (RABM) movement. In Black Metal Rainbows (2023), Daniel Lukes and Stanimir Panayotov define RABM as \"not so much a subgenre tied together by any musical affiliation, but more a network of bands that share a commitment to left-wing, socialist, communist, and anarchist politics and organizing.\" In a 2021 interview with Knotfest, Hallam said that the band's political stance reflected its member's experiences: \"Compared to other black metal bands, we're not Norwegians who have grown up in the woods in isolation, we're in a place where there are fuck-ups by the Tory government left, right and centre, there is horrid shit happening left, right and centre, and we're going to write songs that reflect that.\" Despite this, Underdark do not consider themselves to be a \"political band\". In a 2021 interview with Distorted Sound, Vazquez said that she considered herself \"more of a storyteller than an orator\", though also stated that the band does not reject the RABM label. She also believes that the best way of combatting NSBM is to play better music than NSBM bands.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nAbi Vasquez - vocals (2019–present)\nAdam Kinson - guitar  (2015–present)\nOllie Jones - guitar  (2015–present)\nStephen \"Stig\" Waterfield - bass  (2015–present)\nDan Blackmore - drums  (2022–present)\nPast members\n\nMax Speelman - vocals (2015–2019)\nDan Hallam - drums  (2015–2022)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\n\nSplit releases\n\nSingles\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBassey (December 2021). \"Music Reviews\".

        "content": "The Dark Gods or Dark Ones, also known as the Heptad, were a group of malevolent deities from the religions of the ancient Anatolian peoples.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== The Dark Ones ===\nThis group of deities was known in Luwian as DINGIRMEŠ Marwāinzi (𒀭𒈨𒌍𒈥𒉿𒀀𒅔𒍣) and ᴰMarwayanza (𒀭𒈥𒉿𒅀𒀭𒍝), and in Hittite as ᴰMarkuwayaš (𒀭𒈥𒆪𒉿𒅀𒀸), all meaning lit. 'the Dark Ones'.\n\n\n=== The Heptad ===\nThe Dark Gods were also referred to in Hittite as ᴰŠēpittaš (𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉 and 𒀭𒊺𒂊𒅁𒁉𒀉𒋫𒀸), that is the Heptad. ᴰŠēpittaš was a loanword from the Akkadian ilū sebitti, meaning lit. 'seven gods', due to its similarity for the Proto-Indo-European term for this number, septḿ̥.\nIn the ritual text KUB 59.26, this group of gods was referred to as \"the Dark Heptad\" (Hittite: 𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉𒀭𒈥𒆪𒉿𒅀𒀸, romanized: ᴰŠēpittaš ᴰMarkuwayaš).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dark Gods and the plague-god Iyarri to whom they were associated might have originated from the Babylonian Erra and the Sebitti who accompanied him, with whom they were identical.\nDespite their foreign origin, the Dark Gods and Iyarri had cult places primarily in Central Anatolia and the regions inhabited by Luwians, and Iyarri appeared in Anatolian theophoric names, thus attesting that the people who gave these names saw these deities as being part of their own culture, thus showing that they had become firmly rooted in the Hittite and Luwian religions and had not been transmitted to the Anatolian peoples through the intermediary of Hurrian religion.\n\n\n=== Attestations ===\nThe Dark Gods are attested in the Hittite Empire, where they featured as assistants of the god Iyarri.\nThe Dark Gods were also mentioned in the rituals of Malli and Uḫḫamuwa from Arzawa.\nThe Heptad was also present in the religion of the Hurrian populations of Kizzuwatna:\n\none ritual text mentioning them as part of the entourage of the gods Teššub, Šarruma and Tēnu, and where they were referred to as the \"male gods of Šarruma\" (𒀭𒈨𒌍𒇽𒈨𒌍𒀭𒈗𒈠𒊭);\nanother text mentioned a Heptad of Ištar (𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉𒀭𒈹);\none text describing offerings of birds and breads mentioned the Heptad and the Hurrian god Ḫašulatḫi;\none text reflecting cross-influences between Hittite and Hurrian cults mentioned the Heptad together with the Tutelary God of Tauriša;\ntwo fragmentary texts possibly recording a Syro-Hurrian myth mentioned \"the daughter of the Heptad\" (𒊭𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉𒌉𒊩).\n\n\n== Cult ==\n\n\n=== Nature ===\nThe name \"the Dark Ones\" not only assigned an awe-inspiring appearance to this group of deities, but also ascribed to them a negative role. This is also visible in how one text referred to them as the \"terrifying Heptad\" (Hittite: 𒄩𒁺𒂵𒂊𒌍𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉, romanized: ḫadugaēš ᴰŠepittaes) and another text called them the \"evil Heptad\" (Hittite: 𒄷𒌋𒉿𒀊𒉺𒂊𒌍𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉, romanized: ḫūwappaēš ᴰŠepittaeš).\nThe Dark Gods were conceived as consisting of 14 male deities, hence why their name was written in cuneiform using the Sumerogram ᴰIMIN.IMIN.BI, where the duplication of the cuneiform sign for the number 7 (𒐌) represented a double Heptad.\n\n\n=== Function ===\nAs suggested by their collective name, the Dark Gods were considered to have a malevolent nature, which is also attested through their function in the Uḫḫamuwa ritual from Arzawa, where they represented pernicious forces.\nIn the text KUB 17.16 I, describing a ritual to be performed when humans, cattle and sheep are dying frightfully, several gods are invoked while the Dark Gods are considered to be responsible for the plague.\n\n\n==== Association with other deities ====\nDuring the Hittite Empire, the Dark Gods were associated with the god Iyarri who, like the Greek Apollo, shot his arrows at those he hates. In the Dandanku ritual, meant to prevent the plague in an army by convincing Iyarri to attack enemy countries instead of the Land of Ḫatti, the Heptad were his assistants as the Dark Gods of Iyarri.\nThe Dark Gods were not only associated with deities having negative roles, and in the ritual text KBo 34.48 they were associated with the Tutelary God of the Hunting Bag to eliminate evil, although these deities had different roles, since the performers of the ritual sought, during it, to obtain favour from the Tutelary God of the Hunting Bag but to keep the Dark Gods, referred to in the text as the \"terrifying Heptad\" (𒄩𒁺𒂵𒂊𒌍𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉, ḫadugaēs ᴰŠepittaes), at bay.\nIn the ritual text Vs. I 16, the Dark Gods were associated with several solar deities, including the Sun, the Sun deity of the Ominous Signs, and the Sun-goddess of the Earth, while the Dark Gods themselves appeared as the Heptad of the Sun (𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉𒊭𒀭𒌓).\nA Heptad of Tarḫunna (𒊭𒀭𒌋𒀭𒐌𒐌𒁉) also appears in a list structured like a kaluti- of the Hurrian tradition of Kizzuwatna, which itself describes a late ritual connected to the Hattian myth of the Moon falling from Heaven out of fear of the thunder, lightning and rains of the storm-god. The Heptad also appears in the AN.TAḪ.ŠUMSAR festival, where the Anatolian god Tarḫunna and the Hurrian god Teššub merge with each other, and during which offerings are given to the cart, weapons, thunder, clouds, dew, rains, father-gods, and vizier of Teššub, as well as to the pastistilas Heptad.\nDuring the 8th century BCE, the Dark Gods were associated with the war-god Sanda, who was himself similar to Iyarri.\n\n\n==== Priests ====\nAccording to records of a festival celebrated by a prince in relation to the restoration of cults in the region of Nerik, a priest of the Dark Gods officiated in a temple of his god. The festival itself involved favourable deities, such as Tarḫunna, Telepinus, Kattaḫḫa, Ḫalki and Ḫasammili, and during it the priests of the Dark Gods, of Telepinus and of Kattaha acted together.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "The Torry Island Swing Bridge (also known as the Point Chosen Swing Bridge) is a historic swing bridge located just west of Belle Glade, Florida.  The bridge was built in 1935, making it the oldest swing drawbridge in Florida and the only one in the state that is still operated manually via a crank.  The bridge connects County Road 717 (West Canal Street) on the east side of Lake Okeechobee to Torry Island, a historic site and the lake's only inhabited island.\nThe Torry Island Swing Bridge crosses Lake Okeechobee's rim canal and is only one lane wide with traffic lights on both sides of the bridge controlling the direction of travel on the single lane (as well as stopping traffic when the swing span is open).  The Torry Island Swing Bridge notably provides access to the Torry Island Campground and is opened for vessel traffic on demand by operations at Slims Fish Camp.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBuilt in 1935, the bridge was needed after the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike around Lake Okeechobee.  The dike's construction led to the creation of the rim canal, which needed to be bridged to access what is now Torry Island.  The bridge's steel swing span was a recycled span that had been used previously on the original Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart from 1916 to 1934.\nThe bridge's first tender was Slim Corbin.  Corbin was a worker on the Hervert Hoover Dike after moving to the area from Alabama looking for work during the Great Depression.  Corbin created Slim's Fish Camp on Torry Island, which is still operated today by the Corbin family and still houses the swing bridge's operation.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shi Jianru (Simplified Chinese: 史坚如, Traditional Chinese: 史堅如, June 24, 1879 – November 9, 1900), originally named Shi Jiuwei (史久緯), styled Jingru (經如), later changed to Jianru, was a Christian from Panyu, Guangdong, China (Qing Dynasty). He was a martyr of the late Qing dynasty revolution, also a descendant of the Ming dynasty general Shi Kefa. In October 1900, he made an unsuccessful attempt to bomb the highest-ranking official of Guangdong, for which he was arrested and executed by Qing authorities.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShi was born into a wealthy bureaucratic family, with ancestors from Shanyin, Zhejiang. He had one brother and one sister. Despite being frail in his youth, he was intelligent and fond of learning, enjoying reading books. In 1898, he enrolled in the Christian Gezhi Academy, where he received a Western-style education. In 1899, he joined the Revive China Society through the introduction of a Professor from Gezhi Academy and met Sun Yat-sen in Yokohama, Japan. Upon returning to China, he started to organize revolutionary activities in the Hunan region and planned an uprising.\n\nIn 1900, the Boxer Rebellion erupted in northern China which led to the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance. Revolutionary forces, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, seized the opportunity presented by the chaos to launch uprisings. Zheng Shiliang initiated the Huizhou Uprising, while Shi Jianru raised funds in Guangzhou by mortgaging his own land to support the revolution. However, due to a lack of funds, the revolutionary forces in Guangzhou, led by Shi, were weak, prompting him to devise a big plan to gain influence. He considered assassinating the local Governor-General, De Shou, to support the Huizhou Uprising. Initially, he purchased 25 boxes of explosives, but they were seized by authorities. Later, he acquired 200 pounds of explosives. Under the name of his friend Song Shaodong, Shi rented a mansion behind De Shou's residence and dug a tunnel there to store the explosives.\nOn the night of October 26, 1900, Shi attempted to detonate the explosives. Due to a faulty fuse, they failed to explode. Then, in the early hours of October 30, he successfully detonated the explosives, causing several civilian casualties and damaging nearby buildings. However, the explosion didn't harm De Shou physically; it simply startled him awake by pushing him out of bed. This event astonished the public as well.\nLocal authorities swiftly launched an investigation and obtained information about Shi's whereabouts from one of his relatives, who feared being implicated in the case. Despite the risk, instead of fleeing, Shi returned to the site of the explosion to figure out why De Shou survived the attack. He was captured on his way to Hong Kong at the provincial dock in Guangzhou on October 31 and taken into custody. During interrogation, he endured severe torture, causing him to lose consciousness several times, yet he steadfastly refused to divulge information about his accomplices.\nOn November 8, 1900, De Shou issued the order for Shi's execution. The next day, November 9, Shi was escorted to the execution ground near Tianzi Wharf in Guangzhou, where he was beheaded at the young age of 21. As a warning to the public, his head was displayed at the site of the explosion. De Shou reported the incident to the imperial court and later received approval for his actions.\n\n\n== Afterwards ==\nAfter Shi's execution, the authorities discarded his body in a desolate hill east of the city, where executed prisoners were laid to rest together. Witnessing this, the compassionate abbot of a nearby temple secretly buried Shi's remains in a crypt beneath the Buddha altar within the temple.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Qing dynasty, Shi's story was revisited. In late 1911, voices emerged advocating for the casting of a bronze statue in his honor. On April 28, 1912, Sun Yat-sen convened a memorial ceremony for Shi Jianru in Guangzhou, attended by around six to seven thousand people from all walks of life. Sun praised him as a “model of righteousness and heroism\".\nIn early 1913, the still-living abbot of the temple informed Hu Hanmin, then governor of Guangzhou and a close friend of Shi Jianru, about the burial. The monks donated the temple's land, which Hu Hanmin turned into a shrine for Shi, managed by his relatives. Shi's remains were reinterred in a golden pagoda on the site. Upon learning of this, Sun Yat-sen immediately wrote an inscription for Shi Jianru's memorial. In 1917, the Yunnan-Guangdong Army produced a bronze statue of Shi Jianru.\n\nIn 1924, the Kuomintang erected a white marble statue of Shi at Lingnan School, his alma mater, which was unveiled on May 20 and later moved to his shrine. In December of the same year, Hu Hanmin erected a monument in the First Park (now Guangzhou People's Park) in honor of Shi. In 1928, Shi Jianru's nominal son, Shi Xuji, entrusted the shrine to the government.\nIn 1978, the Guangzhou Cultural Relics Department relocated Shi's golden pagoda to the Huanghuagang Martyrs’ Cemetery and established a shrine for him there, along with his stone statue and Hu Hanmin's inscribed plaque.\n\nIn Sun Yat-sen University (formerly Lingnan University), there is a memorial pavilion called “Xingting,” donated and built by Xing Society students in 1928, to commemorate Shi Jianru, Qu Lizhou, and Xu Yaozhang, three faculty members.\n\n\n== Family members ==\nOlder Brother: Shi Guyu (史古愚, ?-1914), a revolutionary, also known as Zhang Xiaoran. He sold family property to participate in Sun Yat-sen’s revolution.\nYounger Sister: Shi Jingran (史憬然, 1881-1902), was a progressive young woman who majored in Chinese medicine and was active in revolution activities like his older brother. She was also a member of the Xingzhonghui, in which she was the only female. She passed away due to illness caused by cold raw food in 1902.\nNominal Son: Shi Xuji (史勖濟), born in 1904, was the son of Shi Guyu. He became the nominal son of Shi Jianru in his father's wish. He once taught at the 25th Middle School of Guangzhou.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ibsen: \"... den mærkelige mand\" is a biography of Henrik Ibsen, written by Sverre Mørkhagen and published by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag in 2019. The book sparked intense debate among Ibsen scholars and the public in 2019. Shortly after its publication, it received a very positive review in Dagbladet and was awarded a prize that called the book the \"ultimate Ibsen biography.\" However, later in the fall of 2019, it was heavily criticized by leading Ibsen scholars who argued that the book presented an outdated and inaccurate portrayal of Ibsen, ignored recent Ibsen scholarship, and contained unsustainable conjecture and factual errors. Jørgen Haave and other Ibsen researchers described the book as a setback for the academic study of Henrik Ibsen's life and work, due to its recycling of myths and misunderstandings.\n\n\n== Content and reception ==\nThe book is a comprehensive biography that aims to present Ibsen's entire life and work. Each chapter is named after a chapter in Ibsen's play Peer Gynt.\nThe book was the subject of significant debate among academics in 2019. After its release, it received positive reviews from non-specialists, including a very favorable review by Marius Wulfsberg in Dagbladet, where the book was described as \"a masterpiece.\" That same fall, Mørkhagen received the Riksmål Society's Literature Prize for the book, and the jury described it as \"the ultimate Ibsen biography.\" However, later in the fall, the criticism from academic circles studying Henrik Ibsen's life and work grew stronger.\nIbsen researcher and director of the Henrik Ibsen Museum in Skien, Jørgen Haave, was critical of the book and argued that it presented a highly misleading image of Ibsen, recycled old myths that had been debunked, contained many errors and misunderstandings, and did not incorporate Ibsen research from the last decade before publication, including the book Familien Ibsen (2017). Haave called the book \"a speculative and sloppy story\" that \"is a depressing setback for Ibsen research,\" giving \"a completely wrong impression of Henrik Ibsen's life and work.\" According to Haave, the book undermines efforts to document and communicate Ibsen's biography due to its careless use of sources, providing an \"uncritical and imprecise\" recounting that the author \"remembers reading and 'enriches' stories with a good dose of his own invention.\"\nA group of genealogists investigated the book's claim that Ibsen fathered a daughter with a thirteen-year-old and demonstrated that the claim was false.\nIbsen scholar and director of the Ibsen Museum in Oslo, Erik Henning Edvardsen, wrote that \"Mørkhagen's attempt to write an Ibsen biography has so far sparked debate around the peculiar idea of opening the possibility that Henrik Ibsen as a 15-year-old could have impregnated a 13-year-old girl. [...] Mørkhagen retrieves all the missteps found in the secondary literature. [...] Small and large blunders follow each other quickly throughout the work. [...] It's incomprehensible that Gyldendal alone trusted the author's judgment and released the work without any quality control from an Ibsen scholar.\" Edvardsen wrote that Mørkhagen \"exclusively revitalizes outdated errors and has no idea what has happened in Ibsen research since 1977.\"\nHistory professor and Ibsen researcher Narve Fulsås wrote that \"Sverre Mørkhagen does not let research or new sources stand in the way of his good story about a suffering Henrik Ibsen. [...] [The book is] primarily a disappointing testimony to the failure of humanistic Ibsen scholarship. Here, everything seems to have bounced off the narrative that Mørkhagen has already decided on.\"\nThe Aftenposten reviewer, literature professor Henning Howlid Wærp, was critical of the book and argued that it lacked a clear purpose: \"[Mørkhagen justifies] the biography with the assertion that Ibsen's authorship must not 'end up in the shadow of oblivion.' That is hardly a risk.\"\nMørkhagen rejected the criticism, stating, \"I don't fully agree with the fact dogmatism that characterizes parts of the Ibsen community.\" In an interview, he said the Ibsen scholars \"have decided to bark and snap at me with astonishing rage.\" Later, Mørkhagen stated that he and Ivo de Figueiredo represented \"a bolder Ibsen tradition.\" Ibsen researcher Ivo de Figueiredo distanced himself from this, stating that \"unless you miss more Trump rhetoric in historical writing, it is difficult to see Sverre Mørkhagen's confrontation with Ibsen research's 'fact-based dogmatism' as progress.\" He agreed with Haave's points but felt the criticism of Mørkhagen's book was so aggressive \"you'd think the Brekkeparken Museum was under siege.\" Figueiredo also noted that Wulfsberg's review of the book \"makes you wonder what kind of research standards are upheld at the National Library.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It was announced on May 7, 2024, following Apple's event with the tagline \"Let loose\".\nThe seventh-generation iPad Pro will be released on May 15, 2024, and will be Apple's first device to use the M4 chip. The 13-inch version will also be Apple’s thinnest device, with both models surpassing the seventh-generation iPod Nano.\n\n\n== \"Crush\" advertisement ==\nThe initial announcement advertisement for the iPad Pro, titled \"Crush!\", received criticism for portraying various artistic instruments and books being destroyed by a hydraulic press and being symbolically replaced by an iPad Pro. The advertisement was originally posted to CEO Tim Cook's X account and the company's YouTube channel. \nIn a statement to Ad Age on May 9, 2024, an apology was issued by Tor Myhren, Apple’s VP of marketing communications, stating \"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The franchise existed for one season in the Gulf Coast Hockey League before folding when the league dissolved.\n\n\n== History ==\nHouston was one of the founding teams of the Gulf Coast Hockey League and played in the inaugural match on October 19, 2001. However, not much went right for the franchise afterwards. Houston proceeded to win just 2 games all season, finishing last in the 3-team league. Despite this, Houston did make the postseason, but a 0–10 loss proved just how far behind they were. \nThough the league initially planned to return for a second season, the GCHL disbanded without much fanfare over the summer and all three existing teams permanently suspended operations.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Museo de las Américas is a contemporary art museum museum in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Its mission is to offer a synoptic view of the history and culture of the Americas from ancient to contemporary, emphasizing in Puerto Rico, through exhibition programs and cultural activities.\nFounded in 1992 by Ricardo Enrique Alegría Gallardo, a professor at the Universidad de Puerto Rico and founder of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, the museum is dedicated to its role in preserving and perpetuating Puerto Rican arts and culture, both within the territory and abroad. Among its temporary exhibitions, the museum has four permanent exhibitions: The Popular Arts in the Americas, The African Heritage, The Indigenous of America and Conquest and Colonization: Birth and Evolution of the Puerto Rican Nation. Museo de Las Americas is a multidisciplinary, multicultural and multidimensional learning museum, responding to a diverse community, which allows it to consolidate itself as a cutting-edge institution in Puerto Rico.\nIt is currently housed in the former Ballajá Barracks, built between 1854 and 1864 as one of the last major architectural projects of the Spanish colonial rule over the island before it was annexed by the United States in 1898. Initially, when Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States, the federal government paid the Catholic Church for this property, among others in the area. Ownership of the property, claimed by the Catholic Church, was not a straightforward matter and had to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\nThe Government of Puerto Rico acquired the building in 1976 through a transfer from the Government of the United States with the commitment of restoring it and using it for cultural, educative, and touristic purposes. In 1986, a reform plan for the San Juan Historic Zone was sketched and the building was restored from 1990 to 1993.\n\n\n== References ==",

The franchise existed for one season in the Gulf Coast Hockey League before folding when the league dissolved.\n\n\n== History ==\nDallas was one of four teams arranged for the inaugural season of the Gulf Coast Hockey League in 2001. The roster was put together by team owner Pete Griffith and he an appointed Rob Lewis as the player/coach for the first season. After one of the teams failed to materialize, Dallas found itself as the middle child of the group and the squad was able to play most of its scheduled games. In late February, the league approved the sale of the franchise to a new group headed by Jane Goss, who took over as general manager. Dallas finished the year in second place and met Houston in the semifinals. The Sabres won the right to face the Texarkana Bandits for the championship but were routed 1–8 in their final game.\nThough the league initially planned to return for a second season, the GCHL disbanded without much fanfare over the summer and all three existing teams permanently suspended operations.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Internet Hockey Database\nArchived official website",

It was written by Yuri Shevchuk in 1997 for the album “World Number Zero”.\nThe song was written by Yuri Shevchuk while writing songs for the new program “World Number Zero” in 1997. It was originally called “Swamp”, and the first version of the song was included in the so-called “Village Album”   a demo recording of the album “World Number Zero” made by   Shevchuk and  Konstantin Shumailov.\nRough studio recordings of “Svoboda” began in the summer of 1998 during the recording of the album “World Number Zero”, but due to the rigid concept of the album, it was included with modifications in the more lyrical album “Blizzard of August”, released in February 2000.\nThe song was highly appreciated by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He said he had never heard the word sung like that or spoken at all.\nIn 2024, after the death of Russian oppositionist Alexei Navalny, Yuri Shevchuk dedicated a song to his memory.\n\n\n== Participated ==\nYuri Shevchuk —  vocals, author, bells\nVadim Kurylev —  guitars, backing vocals\nIgor Dotsenko —  timpani, cymbals, bells, backing vocals\nKonstantin Shumailov —  keyboards, samplers, backing vocals\nPavel Borisov —  bass guitar, backing vocals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrina Levontina, Alexei Shmelev.Либеральный лексикон\n\"Blizzard of August\".

A resident of Khagaria district of Bihar, Narain was killed in 1942 while leading a flag procession during police firing.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPrabhu Narain was born in 1921 to Sheetal Prasad Singh also known as Shital Mahto and Champa Devi in a Koeri family, in a village called Marar in Khagaria district of Bihar. He was an agitator from his early days and used to work for the right of agricultural labourers in his village. He was often also involved in protesting against their employers for the fair wages. His primary education was completed at Ramganj while he completed his middle school education from Shyamlal High school. He was married to Siya Devi at a young age and during his martyrdom his wife was pregnant. She gave birth to his son who was named Himmat Singh.\nFor higher education, he moved to Banaras Hindu University. During this period there used to be a special class on Indian national movement in the university to bring more and more educated youths in the India's freedom struggle. Narain was motivated to join Indian independence movement at the call of Mahatma Gandhi and in August 1942, he moved from Banaras to Khagaria to take part in Quit India movement.\nOn 13 August 1942, he was joined by another independence activist Bharat Poddar who was a resident of Thana Chowk in Khagaria in the protest of 1942. The protesters were led by Narain and they marched towards police station near Mungeria square to unfurl the national flag of India in order to show their resentment to colonial rule. At Benjamin square, they were joined by activist Motilal and  Munshilal Verma. As the protesters marched forward, British Indian police fired upon them, killing Narain. After the news of his death spread, the commoners gathered from the nearby villages and in association with the protesters, they looted the Olapur police station.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn commemoration of Narain's role in 1942 movement, the place of his death was named as Shaheed Prabhu Narain square upon his name and a life size statue of Narain has been established there.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNanak Bheel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Futher readings ==\nVerma, J.

The reasons for consuming sissy hypno varies, and the userbase consists of wide range of people. Not much is known about sissy hypno, since empirical data on the subject is very limited, and it is unknown what effects it has on people. \nAs an art form, sissy hypno usually consists of edited clips taken from mainstream heterosexual and trans pornography, typically overlaid with instructions that use tropes from commercial film depictions of hypnosis, or from stage hypnosis. It is a form of \"microporn\" as defined by Helen Hester, Bethan Jones & Sarah Taylor-Harman. The suggestive feature of the media, whether its a video or image, or background audio, is sometimes delivered via text-based captions. These captions are embedded into the media and they usually contain suggestive and instructive message.\n\n\n== See also ==\nErotic hypnosis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDawson, Brit (February 2022). \"The Controversial World of 'Sissy Recovery' Groups\".

Thus, the authors of late romanticism, Scapigliatura and symbolism, futurism and magic realism are all represented.\nIt should be noted that during the 1950s a group of writers, poets and critics (who were linked to the definition of the Lombard line) was formed. The group met at the Blue Bar in Milan, in Filippo Meda square, among them were Luciano Erba, Vittorio Sereni and Piero Chiara.\n\n\n== Writers and poets ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLuciano Anceschi, Linea lombarda: Sei poeti, Magenta, Varese 1952.\nDante Isella, I lombardi in rivolta: da Carlo Maria Maggi a Carlo Emilio Gadda, Einaudi, Torino 1984.\nGiorgio Luzzi, Poeti della Linea Lombarda 1952-1985, CENS, Liscate Milano 1987.\nGiorgio Luzzi, Poesia italiana 1941-1988: la via lombarda.

The text \"determines that under current circumstances a major ground offensive into Rafah would result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement including potentially into neighboring countries.\" The resolution says such a move \"would have serious implications for regional peace and security, and therefore underscores that such a major ground offensive should not proceed under current circumstances.\" Israel sets a deadline for the offensive, saying it will begin if the hostages aren't freed by Ramadan.\nOn 21 February, Israel bombed a residential building and wounded one person, leading journalist Tareq Abu Azzoum to state, \"Right now Rafah has been a centre for Israeli attacks\".

        "content": "Mercedes Durán Flores (August 9, 1933 – July 7, 1999), better known by the pseudonym Mercedes Durand, was a Salvadoran poet and journalist.\nShe was a member of the Committed Generation, a literary generation established in El Salvador in the 1950s, as well as the related Grupo Octubre. The poetry she wrote between 1979 and 1981 is considered some of the most important testimonial writing of this critical period in her country.\nOver the course of her life, Durand directed and presented various television and radio programs, and worked on numerous literary magazines in Mexico and El Salvador. From 1963 to 1970, she taught in the humanities department of the University of El Salvador, before her exile to Mexico amid political repression of academics. Her poetry was marked by a deep intimacy, romantic themes, precision, and simplicity, with her autobiographical poems centering on nature and love.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDurand was born in San Salvador, El Salvador, in 1933. She began writing poetry at only 8 years old. After graduating from normal school in 1950, from 1952 to 1958 she pursued literary studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), under a scholarship from the Salvadoran government of Óscar Osorio. Starting in 1950, she became a member of the Committed Generation and the Grupo Octubre, two interrelated groups of writers in El Salvador in this period.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDurand worked as a journalist and television producer, including as desk editor and contributor at La Prensa Gráfica from 1958 to 1960, and as news editor at the Tribuna Libre from 1965 to 1967. She also wrote stories, poems, and essays for such Salvadoran publications as Humanismo and Cultura in the 1950s and '60s. In 1960, she won first prize in the Usulután Floral Games.\nShe taught in the humanities department of the University of El Salvador from 1963 to 1970. While at the university, she served as a member of the school's editorial board and as director of the magazine Vida Universitaria.\nHowever, in July 1972, President Arturo Armando Molina ordered an intervention into the university's activities, shutting down its academic and administrative operations and persecuting the university community. Durand was among the academics who were targeted in this period, and in 1972 she left for exile in Mexico.\nWhile in Mexico, she worked as an editor on the wire section of El Día from 1975 to 1976; for the news broadcaster Canal 13 in 1977; for the publisher Magisterio from 1975 to 1977; and as a copy editor at the publishing house Posada from 1974 to 1976. She also wrote scripts for the comic book publisher Novaro from 1973 to 1975, and taught at UNAM's Center for Communication Studies.\nFrom 1976, she was a founding member of the Latin American Federation of Journalists.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nIn 1952, Durand married the Salvadoran poet Mauricio de la Selva, with whom she had one son. They divorced in 1958, and she later remarried the leftist activist Mario Salazar Valiente. The couple returned to El Salvador after the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Accords, but Salazar Valiente died of a heart attack one day later, which drove Durand to return to Mexico in grief. She died in Mexico City in 1999, at age 65.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nEspacios, Mexico, 1955\nSonetos elementales, San Salvador, 1958, illustrated by the painter Carlos Cañas\nPoemas del hombre y del alba, San Salvador, 1961\nLas manos en el fuego, with David Escobar Galindo, 1969\nLas manos y los siglos, Mexico, 1970\nJuego de Güija, San Salvador, 1970\nTodos los vientos, poetry anthology, San Salvador, 1972\nA sangre y fuego, 1980\nSarah, la luna, la muchacha y otros poemas, Ciudad Juárez, 1982\nLa guerrilla de las ondas y otros ensayos, San Salvador\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "64 Ceti is a star located located in the constellation Cetus. Based on its spectral type of G0IV, it is a G-type star that has left the main sequence and evolved into a subgiant. It is located 42.02 parsecs (137.1 light-years) away, based on a parallax measured by Gaia DR3, and it is moving towards Earth at a velocity of 19 km/s. The apparent magnitude of 64 Ceti is 5.62, which makes it visible to the naked eye only in dark skies, far away from light pollution.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n64 Ceti is a G-type star that has left the main sequence and now evolved into a subgiant, based on its spectral type of G0IV. It has about 1.53 times the Sun's mass and has expanded to 2.53 times the Sun's diameter. It is emitting 8.13 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,066 K. The age of 64 Ceti is estimated at 2.63 billion years, about 58% of the Solar System's age, and it rotates under its axis at a speed of 8.96 km/s, translating into a rotation period of 15 days. The B-V index of the star is 0.52, corresponding to a yellow-white hue of a late G/early F star.\nIt is located in the constellation Cetus, based on its celestial coordinates. Gaia DR3 measured a parallax of 23.8 milliarcseconds for this star, translating into a distance of 42.02 parsecs (137.1 light-years). The apparent magnitude of 64 Ceti is 5.62, which means that it is a faint star, visible to the naked eye only from locations with dark skies. The absolute magnitude, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at a distance of 10 pc (32.6 ly), is 2.49. The star is moving towards Earth at a velocity of 19 km/s. It has a high proper motion across the sky and belongs to the thin disk population, being located 31.03 parsecs (101.2 ly) above the galactic plane.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sydenham Society was a medical society instituted in 1843 in London with the goal of improving the dissemination of medical text by means of translation. The society was considered \"defunct\" in late 1857.\nIt was named after the English physician Thomas Sydenham  (1624–89). \n\n\n== Prospectus ==\nThe prospectus of the Society by the time of its foundation in 1843 stated that: \nThe Sydenham Society has been founded for the purpose of meeting certain acknowledged deficiencies in the diffusion of medical literature, which are not likely to be supplied by the efforts of individuals. It will carry this object into effect by distributing among its members — \n1. Reprints of standard English medical works, which are rare and expensive. \n2. Miscellaneous Selections from the ancient and from the earlier modern authors, reprinted or translated. \n3. Digests of the most important matters contained in old and voluminous authors, British and foreign, with occasional biographical and bibliographical notices. \n4. Translations of the Greek and Latin medical authors, and of works in the Arabic and other Eastern languages, accompanied, when it is thought desirable, by the original text.\n5. Translations of recent foreign works of merit.\n6. Original works of great merit, which might be very valuable as books of reference, but which would not otherwise be published, from not being likely to have a remunerating sale,—such as classified Bibliographies, and alphabetical Indexes to periodical publications and other valuable voluminous works.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe members of the Society produced several medical translations.  As of 1856, membership in the society costed five dollars. Every year, the members received \"three volumes, handsomely bound in a uniform manner in cloth, gilt edged\".  New members could acquire any previous volume for two dollars and fifty cents, or combinations of 3 volumes for five dollars. \nThe volumes included: \n\nSydenhami Opera Omnia\nHasse's Pathological Anatomy\nRhazes on the Smallpox and Measles\nThe Forks of Hewson, portrait and plates\nDupuytren's Lectures on Diseases and Injuries of Bones\nDupuytren on Lesions of the Vascular System &c.\nMemoirs of the French Academy of Surgery\nFeuchtersleben's Medical Psychology\nMicroscopical Researches of Schwann and Schleiden with plates\nWorks of W.

She is recognized as a political prisoner in Belarus by Memorial.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYana Pinchuk was born on June 28, 1997, a citizen of the Republic of Belarus. Until 2018, she lived in Vitebsk, after which she moved to Russia. There, she lived in St. Petersburg, was not officially employed, and worked unofficially as a waitress.\n\n\n== Arrest and imprisonment ==\nOn November 1, 2021, she was detained by St. Petersburg police officers at the request of the “competent authorities of the Republic of Belarus” in connection with charges under Part 3 of Art. 130 (“Intentional actions aimed at inciting other social hostility and discord on the basis of a different social affiliation, committed by a group of persons”, up to 12 years in prison) and Part 1 of Art. 361.1 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus (“Leading an extremist formation”, up to 7 years in prison). By a decision of the Vasileostrovsky District Court of St. Petersburg dated November 3, 2021, a preventive measure in the form of detention was chosen against Pinchuk, which was subsequently extended until April 30, 2022.\nAccording to the investigative authorities of Belarus, Pinchuk, being the administrator of the Telegram channel “Vitebsk 97%”, through the Princess Leia account, “acted jointly and in concert by prior conspiracy in a group with other unidentified persons, while the intent of each covered the actions of another member of the group”, in the period from September 23, 2020, to December 7, 2020, “for the purpose of inciting other social hostility and discord based on a different social affiliation,” posted in this channel “text messages containing a negative assessment of a group of people united on the basis of their employee affiliation law enforcement agencies, public authorities and other groups of persons united by other social characteristics, as well as inducement in the form of a proposal to take actions aimed at causing harm to a group of persons united by belonging to the police.”\nPinchuk was also accused of posting text messages related to extremist materials on the same channel between September 23, 2020, and May 3, 2021 \"for the purpose of carrying out extremist activities” and at the same time managing Vitebsk 97%, which was declared an extremist formation by a court decision in March 2021.\nPinchuk stated in court that she did not commit the crimes charged to her, and learned about the accusations against her only after her arrest.\nOn August 9, 2022, she was extradited from the Russian Federation to the Republic of Belarus due to the extradition ban of the UN Human Rights Committee.\nIn June 2023, the Minsk City Court sentenced activist Yana Pinchuk to 12 years in prison.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPINCHUK Yana // Belarus Women's Foundation",

        "content": "Mikalojus Lipčius (also known as Mikas or Mykolas; 19 December 1894 – 25 June 1942) was the head of interwar Lithuanian military intelligence services (1919–1923), Vice-Minister of the Interior (1923–1924), and director of the finance department of the Ministry of Finance (1927–1940).\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Early life and studies ===\nMikalojus Lipčius was born on 19 December 1893 in the village of Bernotai, then part of the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. Through his mother Kotryna Lipčienė née Mačiulytė, Lipčius was nephew to the priest and poet Maironis. Lipčius attended the Betygala Primary School from 1901 to 1904, and the Palanga Middle School from 1904 to 1909. From 1909 to 1914 he attended a boy's gymnasium in Kaunas. He then studied at the Riga Polytechnic Institute from 1914 to 1916. From 1916 to 1918 he studied at the Russian State Agrarian University, where he met his future wife, the opera soloist Marija Lipčienė-Marcinkevičiūtė. The couple married on 16 February 1920 in Kaunas. They had two children, Algirdas and Aldona. Aldona was a pianist, while Algirdas was the father of the cellist Saulius Lipčius.\n\n\n=== Lithuanian Wars of Independence ===\nIn July 1918, at the end of the First World War and the outbreak of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Lipčius returned to Lithuania. He joined the Lithuanian army on 30 December 1918. He served under Vincas Grigaliūnas-Glovackis in the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He diligently organized propaganda for the Lithuanian army to gather more volunteers. On 13 January 1919 he was assigned to the General Staff. He became a special affairs officer, a title given to covert military intelligence personnel.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Head of intelligence ===\nSoon after he became acquainted with the News unit headed by Jonas Žilinskas. On 12 May the unit was renamed into the Unit of Intelligence, and two days later Lipčius was transferred to the unit as Žilinskas's deputy. As Žilinskas was ill and could not lead the unit, on 10 June Lipčius was made the temporary leader of the unit, and later the permanent leader on 12 July. However, Lipčius soon fell ill himself and had to be substituted by Liudas Gira. Lipčius's unit also participated in the discovery of the Polish Military Organisation's attempted coup of Lithuania. In 1921 he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree. Under his leadership, an official statute of the intelligence agency was written, connections with Latvian intelligence services were made, and courses for intelligence officers began. Lipčius was the first to suggest that the intelligence unit issue certificates of trust to people seeking employment in state institutions, with the goal being to prevent compromised persons from holding responsible positions. In 1922, Lipčius studied at Vytautas Magnus University.\n\n\n==== Klaipėda Revolt ====\nLipčius helped organize the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923 by establishing intelligence gathering areas near the border with the Klaipėda region, then administered by the League of Nations under a French administration. Lipčius recruited and closely worked with Jonas Budrys, who was the head of counter-intelligence. Budrys was sent to Klaipėda in 1922 to explore the possibility of a revolt.\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\n\n=== Vice-Minister and director ===\nOn 25 March 1923, by the decree of president Aleksandras Stulginskis, Lipčius was made Vice-Minister of the Interior. Petras Kirlys succeeded Lipčius as head of the Lithuanian intelligence on 10 April. Within the Ministry, Lipčius helped establish a secret police independent of military intelligence and the Department of Civil Protection, which had the role of criminal police. Lipčius also issued the creation of the Criminal Police Department \"B\" (Kriminalinės policijos skyrius \"B\"). From 1924 to 1927 Lipčius, under state scholarship, studied at the Paris School of Political Sciences with specialty in state finance and administration. On 1 September 1927 Lipčius was appointed the director of the finance department at the Lithuanian Ministry of Finance.  In 1936 he was awarded the Klaipėda Liberation Medal and Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment and death ===\nAfter Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, Lipčius was arrested by Soviet authorities on 1 August 1940 and imprisoned in Kaunas and later Vilnius. He was sentenced to eight years of hard labour, and on 5 June 1941 was deported to Siberia to a camp near the Pechora river, where he died on 25 June 1942.\n\n\n== References ==",

At dawn on the 4th, General Salas ordered Colonel Manuel Lopera to pursue the enemy with 46 hunters on horseback and 40 infantry mounted on their rumps, while Colonel Layzeca with the rest of the restoration force would march along the left bank of the river to support the destruction of the enemy in case they tried to retreat through that place or serve as an eventual reorganization point in case of a contrast.\nWhile the Confederates tried to gain the heights of Cerro de la Sierpe and after exchanging some rifle shots with the restorers, they were hit by the troops commanded by Colonel Lopera, who during the clash lost the horse he was riding, managing, however, to expel the Confederates from the positions they occupied, who after leaving 8 dead and 14 wounded on the field dispersed through the surrounding dunes. The restorers had a Peruvian officer and two Chilean soldiers dead.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nAfter this action, the region was under the control of the restoration army while Colonel Pedernera, with approximately 100 hussars that he managed to gather, marched to Cañete where, on October 12, after holding some encounters with restoration troops under the command of the same Colonel Lopera, they were dispatched in pursuit. Dispersed completely, Colonel Pedernera marching into the interior to join the army of Santa Cruz.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was introduced in May 2024 for the iPad Pro (M4), and is the fourth generation of Apple Silicon architecture, succeeding the Apple M3.\nAccording to Apple, the M4 SoC's Neural Engine is capable of 38 trillion operations per second, \"which is 60x faster than Apple’s first Neural Engine in the A11 Bionic chip.\" The SoC is built upon a 3-nanometer process, and features 3 or 4 performance cores, 6 efficiency cores, and 10 graphics processing cores.\nThe M4 is the world's fastest consumer SoC in single core performance (beating Apple's M3 Max and Intel's Core i9 desktop CPUs), and rivals Apple's M3 Pro desktop CPU in multi-core performance.\nIt is the first iPad SoC to support AV1 decode, and has a new display controller that Apple claims is necessary to support the iPad Pro (7th generation)'s Tandem OLED display.\n\n\n== Apple M4 products ==\niPad Pro (7th generation)\n\n\n== References ==",

Designated as a state park in 1993 by California, with the agreement of elderly members of the native tribe, the land encompassing Tomo-Kahni was a settlement established by the Kawaiisu people. The area was not short of resources, making it a fine place to settle for the Kawaiisu. The park is home to many rock art artifacts by the native tribe that lived there. Utilized to protect the people from winter weather, the settlement's name comes from the language of the Kawaiisu, meaning \"winter home\". Many bedrock mortars remain at the site, acting as evidence for the Kawaiisu peoples' Tomo-Kahni settlement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of California State Historic Parks\n\n\n== References ==",

Figueiredo went on to win the title beating Ken Doherty 5‍–‍2 in the final. Figueiredo thus qualified for the 2024 Champion of Champions event. A total of three century breaks were compiled during the event's main stage, the highest being a 119 made by Figueiredo.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe 2024 World Seniors Championship was a snooker tournament that took place from 8 to 12 May 2024 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 15th edition of the World Seniors Championship, first played in 1991, it was held at the Crucible for the sixth consecutive year and sponsored for the first time by online casino Mr Vegas. A World Seniors Tour event, the tournament was open to all players over 40 who were ranked outside the top 64 in the snooker world rankings. A 30-second shot clock was in place. The event was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 for the first time and by Huya TV for viewers in Asia.\n\n\n=== Participants ===\nThe main stage of the event featured sixteen competitors. Jimmy White, who defeated Alfie Burden 5‍–‍3 in the final of the 2023 edition to claim a record-extending fourth title, was the defending champion, but he lost 0‍–‍3 to Igor Figueiredo in the quarter-finals.\nFormer world champions Ken Doherty, Joe Johnson and Tony Drago were invited to take part in the event. Stephen Hendry was also invited to play, but decided not to enter. Four other players qualified as the winners of regional seniors titles: European seniors champion Darren Morgan, Pan-American seniors champion Figueiredo, African seniors champion Mohamed Khairy, and Asia-Pacific seniors champion Tyson Crinis. Khairy was unable to travel to the event due to visa issues for the second year in a row, and was replaced in the draw by Stuart Watson. Tessa Davidson, topping the female rankings, became the second female player to take part in the final stages of the World Seniors Championship after Maria Catalano in the 2022 event. Tony Knowles, James Wattana and Dechawat Poomjaeng were also invited.\nFour qualifying events were held ahead of the tournament. Andrew Norman booked his place for a Crucible debut via the first event, in which he defeated his brother-in-law Ben Hancorn. In the final of the second one, Barry Pinches beat Lee Walker, 2022 champion of the World Seniors. Michael Judge won over Fergal O'Brien in the final of the third, played in Carlow, Ireland. Rodney Goggins whitewashed Nigel Howe in the final of the last one, which took place in Saint Helier.\n\n\n=== Prize fund ===\nThe winner of the event received £20,000, which meant an increase of £5,000 from the previous event. There was an additional £5,000 on offer for the highest break of the tournament.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== First round ===\n\nThe first round matches were played as the best of five frames on 8 and 9 May. In the opening match, two-time World Championship semi-finalist James Wattana took a 2‍–‍0 lead and then prevented a comeback from Rodney Goggins with a half-century in the deciding frame to advance into the quarter-finals. The 1997 world champion, Ken Doherty, shared the first two frames of his encounter with Tyson Crinis, but then took the third by only one point and made a break of 68 in the fourth to seal victory. Stuart Watson, ranked first in the seniors rankings, whitewashed three-time world semi-finalist Tony Knowles, although Knowles scored points in all three frames. In playing the 2021 semi-finalist Igor Figueiredo, Tessa Davidson became the second woman (after Maria Catalano in 2022) to ever take part in the main stage of the World Seniors Championship. Figueiredo won the opening frame, but Davidson took the second one, also becoming the first female player to win a frame at that stage of the tournament. Figueiredo then secured victory with a 3‍–‍1 result.\nOn the second day, the 1997 International Open runner-up Tony Drago won 3‍–‍1 over Michael Judge, with Drago scoring the exact same amount of points (73) in every frame he took. In the fourth frame, Judge was on a break, but the blue ball bounced out of the back of the middle pocket after he seemed to have potted it. \"Sometimes, I repeat sometimes, you get what you pay for\", complained world number one Mark Allen on social media. Andrew Norman took the first two frames of his encounter with defending champion Jimmy White, who then produced a half-century of 54 in the third to halve the deficit and went on to force the decider. Norman made a 52-point break in the deciding frame, but he did not manage to produce a good safety shot and let White in, who completed the comeback for a 3‍–‍2 win. Barry Pinches scored 199 points without reply as he opened up a 2‍–‍0 lead over 1986 world champion Joe Johnson. Johnson won the third frame on the final black ball to halve the deficit, but Pinches won the match 3‍–‍1. The 2011 champion Darren Morgan was defeated 1‍–‍3 by Dechawat Poomjaeng in the last match of the first round.\n\n\n=== Quarter-finals ===\n\nThe quarter-final matches were played as the best of five frames on 10 May. White, who had reached the final of the championship for the last five years in a row, was whitewashed 0‍–‍3 by Figueiredo. The Brazilian player deemed the victory important \"for the Americas\". In his match against Doherty, Poomjaeng made a 50-point break in the third frame to go 2‍–‍1 ahead, but Doherty produced breaks of 51 and 70 to turn the scores around. \"I'm so relieved to be honest. Dechawat was playing really well and at 2-1 down it was looking a little bit dodgy but I’m delighted to come back and show a bit of character\", he said afterwards.\nAided by a break of 91 in the first frame and taking the second on the re-spotted black, Drago put himself 2‍–‍0 ahead of Watson. The following two frames of the match were contested and eventually shared, resulting in a 3‍–‍1 victory for Drago. Pinches also managed to put himself 2‍–‍0 in front of Wattana, taking the first one on the colours and scoring 67 points in both of the first two frames. A missed pot on the pink gave Wattana a chance he took to halve the deficit in the third frame, but Pinches closed the match in the following one.\n\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\nThe semi-finals were played as the best of seven frames on 11 May. In his match against Drago, Figueiredo took the first frame, in which both players scored points. Drago responded with a half-century, but Figueiredo made one of his own in the third frame to go one ahead once again. He then compiled back-to-back century breaks in the last two frames for a 4‍–‍1 result. The one which clinched victory for him, a 119, would prove to be the highest break of the tournament. Doherty defeated Pinches with the same result. Doherty raced into a 3‍–‍0 lead and closed out the match in the fifth frame.\n\n\n=== Final ===\n\nThe final, officiated by referee Leo Scullion, was played as the best of nine frames on 12 May between Figueiredo and Doherty. Figueiredo had never reached the final of this tournament before, but Doherty was already a runner-up in the 2020 event, where he saw a 4‍–‍0 lead vanish against White, who then went on to win that match 5‍–‍4. Figueiredo and Doherty had met each other twice before, with Doherty winning on both occasions: 4‍–‍2 at the 2010 Rhein‍–‍Main Masters and 4‍–‍1 in the final of the 2018 UK Seniors Championship. Doherty took the opening frame with a century break, his first of the event and the third overall. Figueiredo then replied with a break of 72 in the second frame to restore the balance and went on to win three more on the spin to put himself ahead and only one away from victory.\nDoherty fired back with breaks of 50 and 56 to edge one closer at 2‍–‍4, but Figueiredo cleared the table with a break of 88 of his own in the seventh frame to seal victory with a 5‍–‍2 result. He took £20,000 for the win and an additional £5,000 for compiling the highest break of the tournament. In winning, Figueiredo also earned a place to play at the 2024 Champion of Champions. \"I came in very confident but also nervous because it was a very important moment, not only for myself and my history but for the Americas – it is very important for current players and for the future generation\", said Figueiredo after the match.\n\n\n== Main draw ==\nThe results for the main draw are shown below.

        "content": "Torleiv Hytten CMG (17 February 1890 – 2 January 1980) was a Norwegian-Australian economist and university administrator. He served as vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania from 1949 to 1957. He was previously an economic adviser to the Tasmanian state government and the Bank of New South Wales.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHytten was born on 17 February 1890 in Drammen, Norway. He was one of nine surviving children born to Marie Charlotte (née Knudsen) and Oscar Emil Hytten. His father was a master shoemaker.\nHytten was raised in poverty. He was educated in Tønsberg, but left school at a young age due to his family's financial situation.\n\n\n=== First years in Australia ===\nHytten immigrated to Australia in 1910, initially settling in New South Wales and working for periods as a labourer in Newcastle, at a ship chandler in Sydney, and as a truck driver in Broken Hill. He lived in Broken Hill between 1913 and 1918, where he was active in trade unions and attended Workers' Educational Association (WEA) sessions. He was influenced by WEA lecturer Herbert Heaton and began writing for local newspapers.\nIn 1918, Hytten moved to Tasmania and found work in the mining districts on the West Coast, also writing for the Zeehan and Dundas Herald. He kept in touch with Heaton and soon moved to Hobart where he became secretary of the local branch of the WEA and worked as a journalist for the The World and the short-lived News. He was the chief leader writer for the News on foreign affairs.\nHytten graduated Bachelor of Arts at the University of Tasmania in 1922 and was naturalised as a British subject the following year.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Academia ===\nIn 1926, Hytten was appointed as a temporary lecturer at the University of Tasmania. He completed a Master of Arts in 1929 with a thesis on transport economics. He was a protégé of Douglas Copland and succeeded Copeland as professor of economics in 1930. He was also influenced by his colleagues L. F. Giblin and Jim Brigden.\nResigning in 1935 to move to the private sector, Hytten returned to the University of Tasmania in August 1949. He was the first position to hold the position on a full-time basis. His tenure proved contentious and he dealt with a number of issues, including poor working conditions, low staff salaries, and delays in the planned move from The Domain to a new campus at Sandy Bay. Hytten was ultimately responsible for the controversial dismissal of philosophy professor Sydney Sparkes Orr on grounds of sexual impropriety in 1956, although he claimed to have been forced in to the dismissal by the university's council. He had a close relationship with university chancellor John Morris, but was viewed as out of touch by staff and students. A royal commission into the Orr case was critical of his actions and he resigned as vice-chancellor in 1957.\n\n\n=== Government and banking work ===\nHytten served as an economic adviser to the Tasmanian state government from 1929 to 1935. He gave evidence on Tasmania's evidence before federal bodies during the Great Depression, including the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Initially appointed by Nationalist premier John McPhee, he subsequently worked closely with Australian Labor Party (ALP) premier Albert Ogilvie. In 1935 he was chosen to represent Tasmania at the Silver Jubilee of George V, along with Ogilvie and Frank Gaha. The three subsequently toured Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, reportedly the first such official delegation from any Australian government to visit the Soviet Union.\nIn 1935, Hytten joined the Bank of New South Wales as an economic adviser, remaining with the bank until 1949. In that year he reportedly oversaw a staff of eight researches in the bank's economic department. He opposed the Chifley government's attempts at bank nationalisation, which were overturned by the High Court in Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth. He was a founding member of the Economic Society of Australia and served as chairman from 1933 to 1939 and from 1946 to 1947. He was later appointed by the Menzies government to the board of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, serving from 1954 to 1959.\nHytten attracted public attention in 1949 with his comments opposing the existing bipartisan consensus on full employment, suggesting that a permanent unemployment rate of between six and eight percent would be ideal for economic stability. His comments were publicly criticised by federal government minister H. V. Evatt and appeared in ALP campaign materials in the lead-up to the 1949 federal election. In response Hytten stated that the advertisements came \"close to libel\" and denied any political affiliation, stating that his remarks had been in response to the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia and had been taken out of context.\n\n\n== Personal life and honours ==\nIn 1922, Hytten married Margaret Compton, with whom he had two sons; one died in infancy. In retirement he and his wife moved to Scotland, where their son had settled. He died in Aberdeen on 2 January 1980, aged 89.\nHytten bequeathed a memoir titled To Australia With Thanks: Reminiscences of an Immigrant to the University of Tasmania, which was unpublished at the time of his death. His recollections of his fellow economists, including Brigden, Copland, Giblin and Roland Wilson, have been an important source for historians of 20th-century Australian economic thought.\nHytten was appointed a knight of Norway's Order of Saint Olav in 1951. He was also appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1953 New Year Honours. In 1959, the University of Tasmania established Hytten Hall, a male-only residential college at its new Sandy Bay campus. The college was closed in 1980 but a new residential facility of the same name was opened in Hobart's city centre in 2024.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHagger, Alfred (2007).

        "content": "When Lightnin' Struck the Pine is an album by the American musician CeDell Davis, released in 2002. It was released through Fast Horse Recordings, a label co-owned by some of the members of Davis's backing band. Davis supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded in Dallas and Denton, Texas, the album was produced by Joe Cripps. Davis was backed by the band Tuatara; he was leery of creating a \"primitive blues\" sound, and desired the bigger sound of a full band. Davis used a butter knife as his guitar slide. \"Woke Up This Morning\" is a cover of the B. B. King song. \"So Long, I Hate to See You Go\" is a version of Lowell Fulson's \"Reconsider Baby\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRobert Christgau concluded that \"it'll sure stick to your ribs longer than what Jon Spencer stewed up with R.L. Burnside—long enough to take you back to Davis's 1994 Fat Possum comp.\" The Chicago Tribune opined that, \"despite some funny muttered-word asides, the record is a little too clean and professional, and Davis holds back instead of asserting his slurred- around-the-edges personality.\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that \"the results are deep blue notes twisted and bent to the breaking point, reshaped into surrealistically ragged tones and released to forge otherworldly harmonics.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"it's a glorious, defiant celebration of Mississippi blues, recalling Muddy Waters more than, say, Junior Kimbrough in the deep Delta mud that sticks around greasy tracks like 'Pay to Play' or the closing instrumental 'Hold Me Baby'.\" In 2012, the Dallas Observer listed When Lightnin' Struck the Pine as one of the \"Top Ten North Texas Blues Albums\", deeming it \"a fairly authentic slab of electrified Delta blues.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The white and gold colors of cardinal slice reference the colors of the Catholic Church, however, according to another source, the colors reference the Vatican. These colors appear because of its ingredients; genoise sponge mixture and soft meringue. Outer layers of the cake are a little bit crunchy, and the texture is airy and light. It is generally recommended to be enjoyed with dessert wine.\n\n\n== History ==\nCardinal slice was created in 1933 by L. Heiner café pastry chain in honor of Theodor Innitzer.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is true there is no striking originality eithor in the characters or in the situations which they are made to occupy, but nevertheless the story is one which awakens the interest of tho audience, and stirs the Hibernian breast to positive enthusiasm.\" \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOriginal text of poem at Swan River Press\nShamus O'Brien at Ausstage",

It relies too much on tricks of plot and stage effect, without making any use of the story as means for the subtle development of character, and without any charm of wit or wisdom in the language... two or three of the scenes are laboriously constrained and far-fetched, and this disregard of probability marred the effect of the few genuine touches of nature which stood cutaintly amidst the surrounding conventionality.\".\nThe Sydney Morning Herald called it \"an interesting play\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn English Lass at Ausstage",

        "content": "Marvellous Melbourne is a 1889 Australian stage play by Alfred Dampier and J.H. Wrangham. It was hugely popular in Melbourne and is one of Dampier's most iconic plays.\nThe Age said \"The drama itself seems to be composed of scraps taken from half tho sensational plays which have been produced in this city during the last 20 years.\"\nThe Argus said \"The drama is unsatisfactory in that too much superllous matter is introduced,\nso that the plot does not stand out with sufficent force, and that it is not without incongruity. In its construction there has been too great a desire to provide sensation. Every attempt has also been made to create fun by local allusions fit only for burlesque, and the so called \"working man\" of Australia, the Chinese question, and the land boom afforded convenient agencies for obtaining the laughter of the audience, whose extra ordinarily appreciative mood may thus to some extent be accounted for.\"\nThe play was later published in book form.\n\n\n== Slaves of Sydney ==\nThe script was rewritten for Sydney in 1893 as Slaves of Sydney by Dampier and J H Wrangham.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarvellous Melbourne at AustLit\nMarvellous Melbourne at Ausstage\nSlaves of Sydney at Ausstage",

        "content": "The U.S. Sugar Equalization Board was a United States government agency established on July 11, 1918, during World War I, to stimulate U.S. sugar production by equalizing prices of domestic and imported crops. The board was an agency of the United States Food Administration, with the Food Administrator serving as its chairman. The board was abolished in 1926 by Executive Order 4475.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe board bought and distributed the 1918-19 crop of Cuban sugar, and stimulated U.S. sugar production by equalizing prices of domestic and imported crops. The board also regulated coffee imports under authority of the War Trade Board and the U.S. Food Administration. In 1919, the board's contract with U.S. sugar refiners expired, and the responsibility for regulating and licensing sugar companies became a responsibility of the U.S. Attorney General. The board was a furtherance of the U.S. government's efforts to control the sugar industry during the early 20th century.\nThe board was abolished by President Calvin Coolidge by Executive Order 4475 in July 1926.\n\n\n== Members of the Sugar Equalization Board ==\nEarly members of the board included:\n\nHerbert Hoover, chairman\nGeorge M. Rolph, president\nTheodore Whitmarsh, U.S. Food Administration\nRobert A. Taft\nDana F. Ackerly\nF.W. Taussig, Tariff Commission\nGeorge Zabriskie, Sugar Administrator\nClarence Woolley, member of the War Trade Board\nWilliam A. Glasgow Jr., U.S. Food Administration\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eddisson Rosario Fernandes (born Eddison Rosario Fernandes; 14 June 1983 – 17 October 2009), also known mononymously as Edison, was an Indian comedian, actor, singer, composer, writer, businessman, and former keyboardist known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr (theatre) productions.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFernandes was born as Eddison Rosario Fernandes on 14 June 1983, at Dr. A. V. Da Costa Memorial Clinic in the suburb of Fatorda, located in the state of Goa, India. His parents were Martin and Josefa Mariquinha Alberta Fernandes. Upon the conclusion of his academic pursuits, Fernandes initiated the establishment of a service entity named Master Engineering in the census town of Varca. The company offered a variety of services including air-conditioning supply and maintenance, electrical services, and technical assistance. They catered to a diverse clientele, serving both the public and high-end hotels in the area. In addition to his business endeavors, Fernandes undertook a theater program at the T.A.C.T Institute located in Margao. It was through his acting abilities showcased on the Konkani stage that Fernandes gained significant recognition.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFernandes emerged as a multifaceted contributor to the world of tiatrs, a unique form of Goan musical theater, showcasing his talents as a musician, writer, composer, singer, and actor. Initially establishing himself as a keyboardist, he embarked on his tiatr journey. In 2003, Fernandes made his first appearance in Puro Korat (Enough of That), a tiatr written by Konkani playwright Sharon Mazarello. The production not only participated in the Kala Academy's competition but also earned Fernandes the Best Supporting Actor Award for his performance. A breakthrough opportunity presented itself when Fernandes became involved in the non-stop show Tumi Tumche Dolle Ugddat (You All Open Your Eyes), directed by Konkani theater director Mario Menezes. It was during this phase that Fernandes showcased his acting skills, leaving an impression with his portrayal of a gay character in Ghorabeache Vantte (Division of Family). Furthermore, he displayed his comedic prowess by taking on a humorous role in Sharon's Konkani film Tum Kitem Kortolo Aslo? (2010). Fernandes' talents extended beyond acting, as he proved to be a composer and singer. In Mario Menezes' tiatr Love Story from 2009, his interpretation of the opening chorus, along with his rendition of the song \"Sobit Sopon\" in Dominic Fernandes' Konkani CD Mainchem Sukh, showcased his musical talents. Prior to his involvement in tiatrs, Fernandes honed his musical skills by initially playing the keyboard instrument in a band. Subsequently, he demonstrated his skills in Konkani theatrical productions by Pascoal Rodrigues and Peter de Macazana. Known for his comedic timing and promising acting potential, Fernandes made appearances in several Konkani movies, demonstrating his versatility as a performer while showcasing his vocal talents.\nIn 2007, Mario Menezes, a director within the realm of Konkani theatre affiliated with Menezes Theatre, identified the talent of Fernandes and assigned him the lead comedian role in the acclaimed play Tumi Tumche Dolle Ughddat. Sharing the stage with the Konkani comedienne Joanna, Fernandes delivered a memorable performance that garnered praise from both the director and the audience. This success paved the way for Fernandes to become a regular fixture in Menezes' subsequent productions, including Naginn, Hi Maim Konnanchi, the 2009 play Kal Aiz ani Faleam, and the tiatr titled Beiman Kir released in the same year. However, Fernandes' acting engagements were restricted to only two productions, culminating in his final performance held in his hometown of Orlim. Beyond his theatrical pursuits, Fernandes also made appearances in Konkani video films. He featured in Jacki-E's Hanv Ankvar Kiteak Urlom, where he shared the screen with Anita. Additionally, Fernandes showcased his comedic skills in comedian Michael's Chor Police, as well as Martin de Ponda's productions Puro Anink Naka and Bhogos Saiba. Fernandes showcased his versatility beyond acting as a musician, showcasing his talent in composing lyrics and performing his own musical compositions. One of his popular compositions was the solo titled \"Music, Music,\" which was sung by the young artist Rioma in the play Kal Aiz ani Faleam, a composition that left an impression on the audience. Fernandes' accomplishments include his performance of the song \"Sobit Sopon\" featured in the audio album \"Mainche Sukh,\" created by Domnic and Fernandes and distributed by Manfa Music. His last stage appearance was in Mario Menezes' play Kal Aiz ani Faleam. Beyond his involvement in the performing arts, Fernandes also held the position of proprietor at Master Engineering, showcasing his versatility and diverse interests.\nIn Sharon Mazarello's tiatr Tum Kitem Kortolo Aslo? at the Kala Academy Goa's 30th Tiatr Competition 2004–2005, Fernandes was chosen to play a comedian, a character of a mechanic helper. This theatrical production was later adapted into a Konkani film in 2010, featuring Fernandes in the identical role, and was released after his death. In the original theatrical production, Fernandes' role of a humorous character of a mechanic's assistant, earned recognition for his comedic prowess with a merit certificate. In August 2008, Fernandes further expanded his artistic repertoire by taking part in Mario Menezes's tiatr production titled Ghorabeache Vantte (Division of Family). Displaying his comedic timing and musical abilities, Fernandes captivated audiences as a comedian and singer. The tiatr received acclaim and had successfully staged 82 performances across Goa before captivating audiences at Nashwan Hall in Al Nasr Leisureland, Dubai.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes originated from the ward of Palcut in the village of Orlim, located in Goa. He did not have any siblings, being the sole child of his parents. Fernandes was wedded to a young lady named Anisha.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 17 October 2009, Fernandes, aged 26, died at Goa Medical College in Bambolim, Goa, following a short period of illness. His funeral took place on 20 October at 4:30 pm at St. Michael Church in Orlim, Goa. Surviving him were his wife, Anisha, and his parents, Martin and Josefa.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nMario Menezes, a figure in the realm of Konkani theatre direction, expressed shock and loss upon receiving the news of Fernandes's sudden demise. Known for his talent and promising potential, Fernandes made a significant impact during his two-year involvement in the field with Menezes. He was also known for his commitment, diligent work ethic, exemplary conduct, and punctuality, Menezes stated, \"Fernandes exemplified qualities that were rarely observed among emerging talents.\" Additionally, Menezes noted that Fernandes was well-regarded for his helpful nature and kind demeanor, as attested by others familiar with him. Theatre critic and writer J. P. Pereira from The Navhind Times characterized Fernandes as an individual with skills in comedy, singing, lyric composition, and music, highlighting his human qualities. Pereira also expressed his sympathy to the grieving family.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cuban Boxing Federation (FCB) was established in 1921 in Havana, Cuba. \nThe creation of the National Boxing Commission of Cuba was headed by former Cuban senator and colonel Rosendo Collazo. Collazo was the commission's first president and chairman. Alberto Puig de la Barca is the current Cuban Boxing Federation president.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe Cuban government formed a national commission to monitor boxing and regulate the sport in 1921, following a prior prohibition due to growing violence in the country.\nIn 1962, following the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, the new leader Fidel Castro banned professional boxing. Cuban fighters were limited to the amateur boxing system, which allowed them to compete in the Olympics but excluded them from the lucrative professional fight circuit. In 2007, the International Amateur Boxing Association came under fire from the Cuban Boxing Federation, which claimed that professional boxing promoters who attend amateur boxing competitions are enticing fighters to defect.\nThe International Boxing Association (AIBA) and the Cuban Boxing Federation (FCB) signed a memorandum in 2015 stipulating that all FCB boxers will only participate in AIBA-approved contests, such as the World Series of Boxing (WSB) and AIBA Pro Boxing (APB).\nIn 1968, the federation began holding the Giraldo Cordova Cardin International Boxing Tournament in Havana, Cuba.\nThe Cuban Boxing Federation employed three doctors, a masseuse, and a sports psychologist year-round by 1987. During the early 2000s, the Cuban Boxing Federation appointed renowned Cuban fighter Teofilo Stevenson as its vice president.\n\n\n=== 2022-present ===\nCuba ended its long-standing ban on professional boxing in April 2022, allowing fighters from that country to compete in professional bouts for the first time since the 1962 ban. The Cuban Boxing Federation signed a contract with Mexico's Golden Ring Promotions company, for the representation of Cuba in its entry into professional boxing. As per the agreement, the boxers would receive 80% of the revenue, with the remaining 20% being divided among the federation, trainers, and medics.\n\nAhead of the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the Cuban Boxing Federation declared in December 2022 that it would be lifting its prohibition on women's boxing and forming a national women's team.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "HD 85945 (HR 3922) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major. It is a yellow giant star with a spectral type of G6III:Fe-0.5. Based on information from Gaia DR3, it is located 132.54 parsecs (432.3 ly) from Earth and is moving towards Earth at a velocity of 47 km/s. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.96, which makes it faintly visible to the naked eye.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIt is an evolved G-type giant star, based on its spectral type of G6III:Fe-0.5, which also indicates that is has a [Fe/H] metallicity of -0.5. HD 85945 is 2.5 times more massive than the Sun and has expanded to 10.28 times the Sun's size. It is emitting 78 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,281 K. Currently, the star is located in the horizontal branch stage of evolution. The age of HD 85945 is estimated at 660 million years, and it rotates under its axis at a speed of 7.53 km/s. It is slightly metal-poor compared to the Sun, with an abudance of iron equivalent to 40% of the solar abundance.  \nHD 85945 is located within the Ursa Major constellation, based on its celestial coordinates. The distance to HD 85945 is of 132.54 parsecs (432.3 ly), based on spectra from Gaia DR3. The apparent magnitude of the star is of 5.96, which is brighter than the limiting magnitude for naked-eye vision (6.5m), making it faintly visible to the naked eye. The absolute magnitude, i.e. the brightness of the star if it was seen at a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 ly), is 0.32. At the current distance, its brightness is diminished by 0.03 magnitudes due to interstellar extinction between Earth and the star. HD 85945 is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 46.55 km/s. It has a high proper motion in the sky.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carl L. von Baeyer is a Canadian psychologist, academic, and author. He is a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Saskatchewan.\nVon Baeyer is most known for his work on the assessment of pain in children. He was awarded the 2017 Jeffrey Lawson Award for Advocacy in Children's Pain Relief from the American Pain Society. His authored works include publications academic journals including Pain and The Journal of Pain as well as book chapters.\nVon Baeyer is a Fellow of the Canadian Psychological Association. He has explored and advocated for the benefits and feasibility of a shared parenting arrangement where both parents work part-time while also spending time at home with their children.\n\n\n== Education ==\nVon Baeyer completed his BA in psychology in 1971 from the University of British Columbia, followed by an MA in 1974 and PhD in 1978 from the University of Waterloo in clinical psychology.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVon Baeyer joined the faculty of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon in 1978, assuming various positions. His noteworthy roles included terms as Director of Clinical Psychology Training for the PhD program and chair of the Behavioural Sciences Research Ethics Board.\nVon Baeyer founded and directed the Internship (Residency) Training in Clinical Psychology from 1982 to 1989 and pioneered the Pediatric Complex Pain Clinic Pilot Project in 2009.\nVon Baeyer is a professor emeritus of Psychology at the University of Saskatchewan. After retirement from the University of Saskatchewan and moving from Saskatoon to Winnipeg, he co-chaired the Pediatric Pain Interdisciplinary Interest Group at Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, from 2013 to 2017. Additionally, he served as one of five co-principal investigators and co-founders of 'Pain in Child Health', a training initiative in health research funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. He chaired the ChildKind International Resource Library from 2015 to 2018. Between 2012 and 2018, he held appointments as Professor of Clinical Health Psychology and Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health at the University of Manitoba.\n\n\n== Research ==\nVon Baeyer has authored or co-authored over 120 research articles. His works have been cited over 17,000 times according to Google Scholar.\nIn his 1994 research, von Baeyer investigated whether repeated clinical pain measurement affects perceived pain intensity and distress in low-back-pain patients, finding that daily self-monitoring does not significantly alter subjective pain intensity over an 8-day period.\nMuch of von Baeyer's work has focused on pediatric pain. His 2001 collaborative study introduced and validated the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), a six-face adaptation of the original seven-face FPS for children's pain assessment. It demonstrated a strong correlation with visual analogue and colored analogue scales, suitable for ages 4–12, adhering to a 0-10 metric. In a 2004 publication, he examined the impact of children's memories of painful experiences on their later reactions to pain and healthcare interventions, discussing developmental, individual, situational, and methodological factors, as well as strategies to mitigate negative consequences. In related research, he discussed the assessment of pain intensity in children aged five and older, emphasizing the importance of self-reports while also acknowledging potential biases and errors. The study also explored various pain intensity scales, their limitations, and the need for interpretation alongside other sources of information. His 2007 work provided a systematic review commissioned by Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), focusing on observational pain scales for children aged 3 to 18. It identified 20 scales, recommended specific ones for acute pain contexts, and suggested further research for chronic pain assessment. In 2009, he presented validation data supporting the use of the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for self-report of pain intensity in children aged 8 years and older, demonstrating functional equivalence with other self-report pain scales like the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Moreover, in 2017, he co-edited a book titled Chronic and Recurrent Pain, which highlighted the prevalence and impact of pediatric chronic pain, discussing various conditions, their consequences, and advocating for improved recognition and treatment strategies to advance understanding and care for affected children.\nVon Baeyer's 2018 study investigated the validity and reliability of the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) as a measure of pain intensity in children aged 4 to 17 years, finding strong support for its use in children aged 6 to 17 years but cautioning against its use in those aged 4 and 5 years due to weaker convergent validity. In his 2019 work, he studied clinically significant changes in pain scores among children with painful conditions, using VNRS and FPS-R scales. Taking into account initial pain intensity and patient characteristics, the study offered guidelines for clinical practice and research. A later work published in 2021 examined the suitability of simplified pain intensity scales for preschool-aged children, finding that while 3-year-olds struggle with both scales, 4-year-olds demonstrate greater accuracy with the Simplified Concrete Ordinal Scale, suggesting its potential superiority over the Simplified Faces Pain Scale.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2010 – Outstanding Pain Mentorship Award, Canadian Pain Society\n2017 – Jeffrey Lawson Award for Advocacy in Children's Pain Relief, American Pain Society\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVon Baeyer was born in Zurich, Switzerland; his family emigrated to Canada when he was one year old. He is a descendant of Johann Jacob Baeyer, a German geologist and military officer, whose son, Adolf von Baeyer, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1905. He is the brother of Hans Christian von Baeyer, who is a Chancellor Professor of Physics at the College of William and Mary.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nChronic and Recurrent Pain (2017) ISBN 9783038424161, Von Baeyer, ed.\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nHicks, C.

        "content": "The Ape (or monkey) and the Dolphin is one of Aesop’s Fables and is numbered 73 in the Perry Index. Due to its appearance among La Fontaine's Fables, it has always been popular in France, but in Britain treatment of the story was rarer until the 19th century.\n\n\n== The fable ==\nFollowing a shipwreck off the Greek coast, a pet monkey belonging to a mariner is rescued from drowning by a dolphin. On being asked whether he is from Athens, the monkey boasts that he belongs to one of the city's foremost families. The dolphin then enquires whether he has visited Piraeus (the Athenian seaport), but the monkey thinks that a person is meant and replies that they are the best of friends. Taking a closer look at his passenger, the dolphin realises that he has not rescued a human being and swims off, leaving the monkey to his fate. The fable closes with the assurance that the story is suitable for liars.\nLatin versions of the fable began with the explanation that it was a maritime custom to take along pet animals during voyages, and their example was followed during the Renaissance by Gabriele Faerno in \"Simius et Delphus\", the poem he composed for his very popular collection Fabulae Centum (1563). He was followed afterwards in French by Jean de La Fontaine, who included the story among his Fables (1668) under the title \"Le singe et le dauphin\", with the added observation that according to the natural historian Pliny the Elder dolphins are friendly to the human species. \n\n\n== The fable in Britain ==\nProse accounts of the fable began appearing soon afterwards in Britain, including in the Mythologia Ethica (1689) of Philip Ayres, who also repeats Pliny's observation and titles the story \"The Ape and the Dolphin\". So did Roger L'Estrange in his collection of Aesop's fables a few years later, concluding at the end of his reflexion on the story that \"we have Apes in History, as well as in Fiction, and not a Rush matter whether they go on Four Legs, or on Two\". The grammarian Louis Chambaud goes further in his Fables choisies: a l'usage des enfans, et des autres personnes (1692), concluding his own relation of the fable by asking whether drowning would not be a suitable end for human liars too.\nThe fable was ignored by the main fable collections of the 18th century but appeared in the curiously titled Aesop Unveiled, Or, The Beauties of Deformity: Being a Poetical Translation of Several Curious Fables Out of Aesop and Other Approv'd Mythologists Equally as Diverting and Beneficial to the English Reader as His Comic Shape and Instructive Morals Were to the Ancients (1731). The story is treated with jogtrot joviality and concludes with the moral:\n\nDeceivers are oftentimes left in the briars\nFor none are so odious to all men as liars.\nSeveral more amateur poets retold the fable of the ape and the dolphin in the next century and, though they did not always acknowledge their source as La Fontaine, its provenance is witnessed by the detail of the dolphin's friendship for man being on Pliny's authority. These versions were to be found both in books, as in the case of John Lettice and Elizabeth Pipe Wolferstan, or as anonymous submissions to such transient periodicals as The Yorkshireman and The illustrated sailors' magazine, and new nautical miscellany. George Hardinge, on the other hand, in his poem \"The Monkey and the Dolphin\", gave the ape a leisurely treatment of some 56 lines as the teller of very tall stories. \nIn later years, the fable was included in methodical prose accounts, gathered \"chiefly from original sources\",  such as those by the clergyman Thomas James, George Fyler Townsend, and Vernon Jones. All of these gave it the title \"The Monkey and the Dolphin\", as did the anonymous American editor of Aesop for Children (Chicago, 1919). The text from this was used much later by Dev Virahsawmy to accompany his adaptation of the fable into Mauritian Creole as Zistwar Zako ek Dofen.\n\n\n== Artistic treatments ==\nThe fable's appearance among La Fontaine's fables led to its being included in The labyrinth of Versailles during the 1670s. The 34th sculpture there is ascribed to Georges Sibrayque and once featured a dolphin from whose mouth a fountain jets while the gesturing ape rides on its back. A later park sculpture of the fable, now in the Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, was carved in polished sandstone by Jean-Désiré Ringel d'Illzach in 1903. Various pictorial artists have also illustrated the fable, among whom were Gustave Doré and Gustave Moreau.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dorothy Irene Wilkinson (22 May, 1883 – 18 September, 1947) was a United Kingdom-born Australian headmistress of Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWilkinson was born in the English village of Up Holland. Her mother was Florence (born Shann) and her father, Reverend Christopher George Wilkinson, was to become the headmaster of Launceston Church Grammar School in Tasmania. Her father was invited to move to Tasmania by Bishop Henry Montgomery in 1899 - where he collected ancient stone tools. She was brought up there but she returned to England for her final school at the Clergy Daughters' School in Westmorland in 1896. The school had been the basis of the school in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre some years before. Wilkinson returned to Tasmania and she did some teaching at her father's school. She qualified as a teacher at the University of Melbourne in 1912. In the following year she gained her first degree in history.\n\nEdith Badham, the long-serving head of the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst, died in 1920. She was succeeded by Wilkinson. She was awarded her masters degree by her alma mater in 1921. She gave the school a High Anglican and Christian ethos, and wrote the school chapel hymn as well as prayers and other hymns. \nWilkinson gave up being the honorary secretary of the Association of Headmistresses when she retired from the school in 1947 and she died later that year in Sydney's Neutral Bay, in an accident, when she fell while getting off a bus. She was succeeded by Barbara Chisholm. Her school has a portrait of her and, although now named SCEGGS Darlinghurst, \"her\" school was still in operation in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "\"Kamippoi na\" (神っぽいな, 'God-ish') is a 2021 song written by Japanese music producer PinocchioP (ピノキオピー) and performed by Vocaloid virtual singer Hatsune Miku. The song is one of the most viewed Vocaloid songs on YouTube, and has been covered by singers such as Ado.\n\n\n== Lyrics and composition ==\n\"Kamippoi na\" is a fast-paced electropop song, with the vocal range spanning from the low-note of mid2A (A3) to the high-note of hiD# (D#5), and the highest falsetto note hihiD# (D#6) appears before the last refrain. \nThe song satirizes the modern popular trend. The word \"God-ish\" repeatedly appears in the song lyrics. PinocchioP explained that although someone appears to understand everything, eventually is just \"god-ish\", not \"god\".\nThe lyrics quote Friedrich Nietzsche's statement \"Gott ist tot\". PinocchioP expressed his liking for \"active nihilism\" in the interview, and thought the words aligns with the song title and his mode of thinking.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nAn music video for \"Kamippoi na\" was released on September 17, 2021. The music video illustration darws a nun wearing a tongue ring and holding a cigarette. The animation style of music video adopts the popular Vocaloid music videos' style, forming a contrast with the song theme.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nowon B (Korean: 노원구 을) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Nowon District, Seoul. As of 2024, 211,043 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Nowon B has elected members of the Democratic Party and predecessor parties in all but two elections and is thus regarded as a stronghold for the Democratic Party. \nKim Yong-chae of the right-wing New Democratic Republican Party was the first member to represent Nowon B, narrowly defeating Lim Chae-jung of the centre-left Peace Democratic Party by a little over 1,000 votes. In the following election, Kim Yong-chae had initially won re-election by a margin of thirty-six votes. However, after it was discovered that a bundle of one hundred votes were mixed up and not counted properly, a recount was performed. The recount declared  Lim Chae-jung of the centre-left Democratic Party the winner with only 172 votes separating him from incumbent Kim Yong-chae. Lim won re-election in 1996 and 2000, but did not stand for re-election for Nowon B in 2004, running as the Uri Party candidate for the newly created Nowon C constituency instead. Lim was succeeded by Woo Won-shik of the Uri Party who defeated Kwon Young-jin of the centre-right Grand National Party. In a return match held at the next election, Kwon Young-jin defeated Woo, garnering 49.93% of the vote while Woo received 44.09%. In the 2012 election, Woo and Kwon faced off again; Woo ended up narrowly defeating incumbent Kwon Young-jin by a margin of 1.78%. Woo comfortably won re-election in 2016 and 2020, receiving 51.95 and 62.67% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, the Nowon C constituency was abolished as a result of a decrease in population in Nowon District. Incumbent member Woo Won-shik ran in the Nowon A constituency after beating incumbent Koh Yong-jin in a primary and Nowon C incumbent Kim Sung-hwan was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for Nowon B. Kim Sung-hwan went on to win in the general election with 58.51% of the vote.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses Junggye 1-dong, Junggye 4-dong, and Sanggye-dong. It borders the constituencies of Uijeongbu B to the north, Dobong A and Dobong B to the west, Nowon A to the south, and Namyangju B to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Junes Lokka (born January 14, 1979) is an anti-immigration activist. From 2017 to 2021, Lokka served in the Oulu city council from the True Finnish Joint List (ASYL). His activity on social media is focused on video broadcasts. Lokka is taking part in the 2024 European Parliament elections as a candidate for the Freedom Alliance.\n\n\n== Criminal proceedings ==\nIn the 2017 municipal elections, Lokka was elected to the Oulu city council from the joint list of the ASYL. During the negotiation of trust positions, ASYL's representatives were excluded from the trust positions due to Lokka's bad behavior and inappropriate language. Lokka denied having used inappropriate language. He claimed that inappropriate behavior occurred towards ASYL representatives. In the procedural dispute raised by Lokka's council group, the administrative court sided with ASYL regarding the meeting's technical violation, but the supreme administrative court considered the inadequate procedures in some places to be acceptable considering the whole.\nIn September 2018, the Oulu district court sentenced Lokka to pay a fine for incitement against an ethnic group.\nIn February 2019, several decisions were made not to indict Lokka for the crimes he was suspected of committing.\nJournalist Johanna Vehkoo was charged with defamation when in November 2016 she had called Lokka on Facebook, among other things, a Nazi, a Nazi clown and a racist. The Oulu district court sentenced Vehkoo to pay a fine for defamation in April 2019. Lokka had demanded compensation of 1,500 euros, but according to the district court, Lokka's own behavior reduced the compensation. Vehkoo appealed the verdict to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the verdict. Vehkoo received permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, which rejected the charge with a preliminary decision issued on January 11, 2022. According to the Supreme Court, Vehkoo's writing was aimed at \"Lokka's conduct in politics or comparable public activities and which concerned a subject of general interest\" and considering Lokka's own conduct, Vehkoo's writing did not exceed the limits of acceptability.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Oulu Prosecutor's Office announced two charges against Junes Lokka for incitement against an ethnic group. In February 2020, the Oulu district court sentenced Lokka to fines for inciting against an ethnic group. The Rovaniemi Court of Appeal kept the district court's verdict unchanged. In its decision in November 2022, the Supreme Court upheld Lokka's previous fine. The verdict concerned the videos he published on YouTube, which contained speeches given at a demonstration in Helsinki in August 2016, which the Supreme Court considered to be hate speech aimed at immigrants and Muslims.\nEarlier in April 2019, Lokka was charged with four counts of defamation and spreading information that violates private life.\nIn January 2021, Twitter suspended Lokka's account for violating the rules. In the same year, the district court of Oulu convicted him of inciting against an ethnic group. Lokka had suggested hiring death squads. In December 2021, the District Court of Oulu sentenced Lokka to a fine for defamation, which means that with his income, the amount of fines came to 285 euros, and he was also ordered to pay 400 euros in damages. The events that led to the verdict began during the 2017 municipal elections, when Lokka was not accepted as a participant in the election panel, to which only party representatives had been invited.\nIn 2022, the Oulu District Court found Junes Lokka guilty of three counts of defamation and one of spreading information that violates private life. According to the district court, a fair verdict would have been a fine, but the trial had been delayed by a year, so as compensation, Lokka was not punished.\nJournalist Tommi Parkkonen was sentenced to a fine and to pay one thousand euros in compensation to Lokka in 2022. Parkkonen was deemed to have insulted Lokka's honor in a tweet he sent in April 2019, in which he commented on the case concerning Johanna Vehkoo.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bucknell Greenway is an educational recreation path in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. When completed, it will run for around 4 miles (6.4 km), circumnavigating the exterior of the Bucknell University campus, and is for use by walkers, runners and cyclists. The path will connect the main campus to the athletic fields, located across the busy U.S. Route 15. It will pass by points such as the Grove, Bucknell Farm and the Christy Mathewson–Memorial Stadium. \nThe first section of path was opened during the school's Earth Day celebrations in April 2023. \nAs of 2024, around thirty students were working on the project, under the guidance of Paul Siewers and Gabriel Diego. It will include commemorative plaques, native plants, and trees and benches. QR codes will be added to stops, allowing people to scan them with their phones and read further information. The project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2025. \nOne of the stops on the path, the former carriage house beside the Bliss–McClure House on University Avenue, was a stop on the Underground Railway which passed through Union County. \n\n\n== References ==",

She was elected to this position in February 2023, she is only the second woman to hold this post in Delhi's history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShe hails from Mumbai and has ancestral ties to Hyderabad.\n\n\n== Life ==\nFour years ago, she officially became a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, although she has been associated with the party for approximately 15 years through her involvement with the minority Morcha. She has expressed her dedication to serving the Haj Committee and has emphasized the significance of fulfilling the aspirations of those embarking on the Haj pilgrimage as a selfless act. While her early life details remain relatively undisclosed, her affiliation with the BJP and recent appointment as the chairperson of the Delhi Haj Committee underscore her active engagement in community service and politics. Kausar Jahan is a regular at the city's cultural events. She also heads charity groups championing women's issues and has been associated with a Delhi-based NGO named Sampurna, which focuses on welfare-related work.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nAam Aadmi Party has criticized the election, alleging an ‘unholy alliance’ between the BJP and Congress and accusing the Delhi L-G of dishonesty in the formation of the committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Justin Milano (Japanese:  ジャスティンミラノ, foaled April 9, 2021) is an active Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse. He won the Satsuki Shō (Japanese 2000 Guineas) in 2024.\nHe was named after Milan, a city in Italy, while \"Justin\" is the eponym used by the owner.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old-season ===\nJustin Milano debuted on November 11, 2023, at the Tokyo Racecourse in a two-year-old newcomer race on turf at a distance of 2,000 meters, ridden by Tom Marquand. He settled in front of the pack and  pulled away fast at the final stretch to win his debut race.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 2024: three-year-old season ===\nJustin Milano would make his first graded stakes race debut at the Kyodo Tsushin Hai on February 11, 2024. Ridden by Keita Tosaki, he settled in just behind the leader and moved forward after entering the final stretch in response to Tosaki's urging to take the lead, managing to successfully hold off last year's Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes winner Jantar Mantar to win by one and a half horse lengths. On February 28, it was announced by his connections that he was registered to compete in the Epsom Derby.\n\nCanceling the previous plan to enter the Epsom Derby, he was instead scheduled to race at the Satsuki Shō (Japanese 2000 Guineas) on April 14. He broke well off from the gates at the start of the race and settled in at the middle of the pack near the front. Entering into the final straight, he overtook Jantar Mantar who took the lead early and managed to hold off the fast-finishing Cosmo Kuranda, breaking the track record by 0.7 seconds at a time of 1:57.1 seconds. This was his first grade one stakes victory. A week before the race, jockey Kota Fujioka, who rode for him whenever he was training, died in a horseracing accident. His jockey, Keita Tosaki, said, \"Kota was the one who trained with this horse a few weeks ago. He gave me the information I needed about the horse. I won this race because of him.\" His trainer, Yasuo Tomomichi, said with tears in his eyes, \"I owe this victory to him (Kota).\" This victory marked the first time that a Kizuna offspring won one of the eight major races in Japanese horseracing.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Racing statistics ==\nBelow data is based on data available on JBIS Search, and NetKeiba.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

Compiled and published by the Official Charts Company, the data is based on each album's weekly physical sales, digital downloads and streams. In 2007, 52 charts were published with seven albums at number one. Frank, the debut album by Amy Winehouse, was the first number-one album of the year, having reached the top spot for the first time in the last week of 2006. Michael Bublé's fifth album Call Me Irresponsible was the last number-one album of the year, spending the last two months of the year atop the chart.\nFrank and Call Me Irresponsible were the most successful albums on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart in 2007 – they each spent 18 weeks at number one, with the former's longest run of 12 weeks and the latter spending two spells of eight weeks each. Norah Jones spent seven weeks atop the chart in 2007 with her third release, Not Too Late. Madeline Peyroux also spent another three weeks atop the chart with her fourth studio album, Half the Perfect World, which was matched by the various artists compilation The Very Best of Latin Jazz.

        "content": "Unheard Melodies: Narrative Film Music is a book by film scholar Claudia Gorbman, first published in 1987 by Indiana University Press and the British Film Institute. It explores the role of music in cinema and the history of its analysis, the latter engaging with the 1947 book Composing for the Films by Theodor W. Adorno and Hanns Eisler.\nThe book is notable for having introduced the terms \"diegetic\" and \"non-diegetic\" to describe the relationship between music and film narration, deriving from narrative theory.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe book is divided into two parts: \"Music in the Narrative Cinema\", dealing with the history and content of film music analysis since the beginning of film, and \"Three Analyses\", a series of chapters examining the films Zero for Conduct, Under the Roofs of Paris and Hangover Square according to the framework of the first part.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review written for Film Quarterly, Kathryn Kalinak characterized the book as \"a ground-breaking work which provides an access point to the admittedly foreign terrain of film music for the film scholar/critic and establishes the standard for theoretical discourse in the field.\"\nReviewer Alan Durant summarised the work as follows: \"Put at its simplest, the book explores 'why' film-soundtrack history happened as it did, by relating the historical development of soundtrack conventions to different kinds of argument about film music's function. [...] Unheard Melodies is undoubtedly the most useful available guide to film soundtrack: an enjoyable book to read and an indispensable aid to anyone working in the field.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nFilm music\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "To the West is a 1896 Australian stage play by Alfred Dampier and Kenneth Mackay, a Member of Parliament. It was Mackay's first play. The script was based on an earlier work of Mackay's, The Yellow Wave.\nThe play featured horses and sheep on stage. There was an Aboriginal character, Geebung.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"originality was not the strong point of the authors of the new drama.\" Another review from that paper said \"Mr. Dampier's rescue of his friend during the sensational explosion in the mine, and the incident in which the police are baffled through the instrumentality of the black boy, who unfastens their saddle girths are amongst the many situations which find favour with the audience.\"\nThe Sunday Times called it \"a good workable play.\"\nTable Talk said Dampier \"has never had a part better fitted to his powers than Dick Stewart; he literally\ndominates the first act and as the lonely wanderer dowered with gold beyond the dreams of avarice, yet on the verge of death from thirst in the maddening glare of the arid plains he rose to a height of tragic intensity which the audience found most convincing.\"\nBird of Freedom aruged \"being a colonial play, its critics have naturally judged it from the Shakespearoan standard, . aud written accordingly. As a matter of fact, To the West modestly announces itsolf as a realistic, sensational play, aud should be viewod accordingly. Of its kind it is one of the best picutres wo have witnessed in Sydney, and is likely when certain scenic defects have beon got over to prove the most popular Australian play  yet written.\"\nFreeman's Journal called it \"perhaps the best effort yet staged by any Australian dramatist.\"\nLeslie Rees wrote \"Its scenes were set on the ship Westralia nearing Australia’s shores, at Fremantle where the hero is “fortune’s fool”, at Coolgardie where the great gold search is on, near the Great Salt Lake, and on Black Flag Plain. Shocks included an explosion in the mine, with the hero buried alive, and a final fight on the cliffs and the death of two villains, including a Svengali-like fellow whose power over a charming young girl had been causing concern throughout.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It will be the 49th consecutive edition of the World Snooker Championship to be held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.\nKyren Wilson will be the defending champion, having defeated Jak Jones in the 2024 final.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe final of the first World Snooker Championship took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Staged annually until 1940, the tournament was not held from 1941‍–‍45 due to World War II and went into decline in the post-war era; the 1952 event was contested by only two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was also discontinued in 1957. Joe Davis won the first 15 World Championships, held from 1927 to 1946, and is the only undefeated player in the tournament's history. \nRevived on a challenge basis in 1964, the World Championship reverted to an annual knockout tournament in 1969, which marked the beginning of the championship's \"modern era\". The 1977 tournament was the first staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, where it has remained since. Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan are the most successful players in the World Championship's modern era, each having won the title seven times. Hendry is the tournament's youngest winner, having captured his first title in 1990, aged 21 years and 106 days. O'Sullivan is the oldest winner, having secured his seventh title in 2022, aged 46 years and 168 days.\nThe 2025 event (officially the 2025 Cazoo World Snooker Championship) will be organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the third time by car retailer Cazoo. It will mark the 49th consecutive year that the tournament has been held at the Crucible, and the 57th successive year that the World Championship had been contested through the modern knockout format. Kyren Wilson will be the defending champion, having defeated Jak Jones 18‍–‍14 in the 2024 final to win his first world title.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is located 869 million light-years from the Solar System and has dimensions of 0.90 x 0.6 arcmin, meaning IC 3222 is 235,000 light-years across in diameter. This makes it a large galaxy. IC 3222 was discovered by Max Wolf on March 23, 1903.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIC 3222 has an active galactic nucleus. It is classified as a LINER galaxy. That is, a galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum which is characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms.\nThis activity might be attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole, making IC 3222 one of the galaxies with the largest AGN sub-population, which dominate in numbers over Seyfert galaxies and quasars.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Estela López García (born December 22, 1986) is a Chilean journalist.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEstela López García was born in Santiago, Chile. She attended Colegio José Luis Lagrange before pursuing a bachelor's degree in journalism and political science from the Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago and Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain. She furthered her education with a Master's in creative writing from the Barcelona School of Management from August 2018 to June 2019.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2005–2006, she was in charge of the communications and public relations area of the Federación Ecuestre de Chile. \nBetween 2006 and 2011, she worked as a journalist and photographer for Desarrollos Inmobiliarios y Constructora Valle Grande S.A. in Santiago.\nIn 2010, she joined the journalistic team of the international news network CNN Chile. She was part of the team that reported during the first hours after the 2010 Chile earthquake.\nAfter two years at CNN Chile, she was selected for an internship at the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington, D.C., where she collaborated on cross-border projects within the Strategic Communications and Press Department.\nReturning to Chile, López transitioned to the financial sector in mid-2012, becoming part of the founding team of the economic newspaper Pulso, later merging with La Tercera.\nAfter Pulso, she served as communications director at Junaeb, a Chilean state agency focused on economic and social support for vulnerable children.

        "content": "The Court-Martial of Appeal (Swedish: Krigshovrätten) was a Swedish court. It was the appellate court among military courts and heard cases appealed from regimental courts-martial. The establishment of Sweden's first military appellate court, the Colonel's War Court, occurred through Gustavus Adolphus' Articles of War in 1621. Later, during Queen Christina's reign, this court became a division of the War College. In 1791, the Court-Martial of Appeal was created, initially consisting of at least 7 members, including military officers and a justiciar. Dissolved briefly, it was revived in 1797 and designated as the appellate court during peacetime. Over time, its composition and role evolved, eventually becoming a division of the Svea Court of Appeal in 1916. Finally, with the Military Court Proceedings Act of 1948, military cases in peacetime transitioned to ordinary courts, leading to the abolition of the Court-Martial of Appeal in 1949.\n\n\n== History ==\nThrough Gustavus Adolphus' Articles of War of 15 July 1621, a field court-martial, called the Colonel's War Court (Överste Krigsrätt i Fält), was established, which can be regarded as Sweden's first proper military appellate court. This court, which, like the Svea Court of Appeal established in 1614, judged the King's verdicts, had the Lord High Constable as its president and a number of senior military officers as its members. During Queen Christina's reign, the War Court became a division of the War College with the College President, the Lord High Constable, as president, along with 6 military officers and the same number of collegiate assessors as assistants. However, in 1683, by Charles XI, two military appellate courts were established, namely a General War Court (General-Krigsrätt) for the army and an Admiralty Court (Amiralitets-Rätt) for the navy. These courts consisted exclusively of military members.\nIn 1774, the cases of the General War Court were once again transferred to the War College, where they were handled for 17 years. Then, on 14 March 1791, King in Council's proclamation \"regarding a single and general appellate court in Stockholm for the entire King in Council's Armed Forces on land and at sea in Sweden and Finland\" came. The new appellate court was called the Court-Martial of Appeal (Krigshovrätt)) in the proclamation, a designation encountered here for the first time. On the same day, it received a special procedural order. The King in Council's Court-Martial of Appeal would consist of at least 7 members, including the president, of which 6 would be military officers and one would be a justiciar.\nThe Court-Martial of Appeal was dissolved a few years later but was revived by a royal proclamation in 1797. In the Articles of War of 1798, it was determined that the Court-Martial of Appeal would serve as the appellate court during peacetime, while during wartime, special appellate courts should be appointed: a General War Court for the land army and superior courts for the navies. The position of justiciar was changed in 1827 to a Lord Justice of Court-Martial of Appeal's (krigshovrättsråd) office.\nAccording to the Royal Ordinance on Military Courts on 11 June 1868, the Court-Martial of Appeal was the second court within the military (§ 2). When ordered by the king, a special Supreme Military Court (Överkrigsrätt) could be established for an army outside the realm or for a fleet on a naval expedition (§ 12), or for both jointly. The Court-Martial of Appeal was composed of four military members appointed by the king for three years, namely a general officer as president and three regimental officers (including at least one with the rank of colonel), as well as a civilian member appointed by the king with the title of Lord Justice of Court-Martial of Appeal. Of the three regimental officers, one was to be from the navy, while the other two were from the army. In addition to being the appellate court for military courts, the Court-Martial of Appeal also immediately handled certain cases, namely those involving crimes committed by officers, and other cases specified by separate legislation for immediate review and judgment by the appellate court.\nThe public prosecutor at the Court-Martial of Appeal was, according to the law of 1914, the chief public court-martial prosecutor (överkrigsfiskalen). Until then, it was the court-martial prosecutor (krigsfiskalen). In 1916, the military appellate court underwent a profound transformation. Through the military legislation in force from that year until 1949, the military appellate court became a division of the Svea Court of Appeal. Of the previous composition of the military appellate court, the military appellate court judge and two military members, one for the army and one for the navy, were retained. In addition, two hovrättsråd from the Svea Court of Appeal were now included, one serving as the president.\nThe Military Court Proceedings Act (Militär rättegångslag (1948:472)) of 30 June 1948 stipulated that military cases in peacetime should be handled in ordinary courts. Thus, the Court-Martial of Appeal was abolished. On 30 June 1949, the court held its final session in the plenary hall of the Svea Court of Appeal in the Wrangel Palace.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n1810–1812: Carl Nathanael af Klercker\n1812–????: Fredrik Tersmeden\n1816–1820: Georg Carl von Döbeln\n1824–1825: Carl Pontus Gahn\n1858–1864: Nils Gyldenstolpe (acting)\n1864–1871: Magnus Björnstjerna\n1872–1882: Samuel August Sandels\n1882–1903: Sven Lagerberg\n1903–1910: Hemming Gadd\n1911–1915: Olof Malm\n1916–1929: Johan Lagerbielke\n1929–1937: Anders Renström\n1937–1943: Henric Nordenskjöld\n1943–1949: Arvid Johansson\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "World Music Cultures Center is a scientific and creative center at the Moscow State Conservatory, which conducts scientific, informational, organizational, concert, festival and educational activities. The scientific and creative center organizes festivals and conducts master classes with famous performers of traditional music from around the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe “World Music Cultures” structure at the Moscow Conservatory was founded in September 1976 by composer Jivani Mikhailov. Personal connections and acquaintance of the composer with musicians of traditional cultures of Africa, Asia and America had already played a significant role by the time of the creation of “World Music Cultures”. A look at various cultures from the inside and the composer’s direct, in-depth acquaintance with them allowed him to study the deeper layers of traditional cultures and begin to introduce them to the Moscow audience, gradually expanding it.\nIn the early 1970s. J. Mikhailov’s concept “of the multiplicity and dissimilarity of sound systems” was not taken seriously by many; Soviet musicology had basically only a Eurocentric orientation, trying to embrace all the musical cultures of the world precisely from these ideological positions.\nAt first, this structure functioned in the form of a training course, then a system of courses “Music cultures of Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Oceania”. At the same time, the Department of the History of Foreign Music established an educational and support structure in the form of the “Sector of World Music Cultures” (1980–1984), and later the Cabinet with the same name (since 1984). At various times, the office operated under the Department of Musical Cultures of the World (1990–1995), then became an independent structure (1995–2003), and in 2003 it was included in the Office for Coordination of International Activities Programs (since 2015 - Office of International cooperation) as the Department-Center “Musical Cultures of the World”. In 2010, the department-center received its current name: the Scientific and Creative Center “World Music Cultures”\n\n\n== Activities of the center ==\nToday, the scientific and creative center operates under the Department of International Cooperation of the Moscow Conservatory and plays an important role in the creation and implementation of various international cultural and musical projects. The center operates the “Russian-Japanese Center for Musical Culture”, as well as a number of creative groups: the Iranian music group “Caravan”, the Chinese music ensemble “Dragon and Phoenix”, the Japanese music ensemble “Wa-On”.\nOver the course of many years of cultural activity of the center, a unique fund of materials was accumulated, along with it a special library, a music library and a video library were created. The center organizes numerous concerts, creative meetings, lectures by famous performers of traditional musical cultures, as well as other scientific and educational events, theatrical projects (“The Legend of the Flower of Style”, Opera “O-Natsu”, weeks of Iranian theater in Moscow), and also annually conducts large-scale international creative projects, such as the “Universe of Sound”, “Soul of Japan”, “Descendants of Arctida”, “Gathering Friends” festivals, etc.\nThe center conducts educational activities at the Moscow Conservatory, an important place in this activity is given to lecture courses for undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to this, diploma and dissertation research is conducted. Along with this, there are classes in traditional Japanese, Chinese, Indian and Iranian music.\nSince 1999, the international festival “Soul of Japan” has been held annually from September to December; since 2003, from May to June, “The Universe of Sound”; since 2007, in August, “Gathering Friends”.\nIn the context of the epidemiological situation with COVID-19 and the closure of concert halls and other venues in Moscow and other Russian cities, the center implemented a number of creative projects online (“Moscow - a crossroads of cultures”, etc.).\nThe center’s festivals take place not only in Moscow and Russian cities, but sometimes also include concert venues in Japan, China, Colombia and other countries near and far abroad.\nThe center employs such musicians as Atish Mukhopadhyay (India), Hossein Nursharg (Iran) and others.\nToday, the head of the center is Margarita Ivanovna Karatygina.\n\n\n== Conceptual basis of the center ==\nThe center's methodology was developed by its founder, Jivani Mikhailov. Its peculiarity lies in the fact that all layers of musical culture (academic, traditional, popular music) are recognized as equally important and they are studied in depth in the context of interaction. At the heart of the methodology, one of the key places is occupied by the regional civilizational approach, on the basis of which nine regional civilizations are identified on the “musical map of the world”, each of which is studied by comparison with each other: Europe, the Near and Middle East, Tropical Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Far East, Australia and Oceania, America.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\n“The Universe of Sound” (May-June)\n“Gathering Friends” (August)\n\"Soul of Japan\" (September-December)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nМациевский, Игорь, ed.

        "content": "Rotem Reshef (Hebrew: רתם רשף; born 1964) is an Israeli-American abstract painter and site-specific installation artist known for her process-based action painting technique and large-scale works, characterized by vivid and exuberant compositions. She works and lives in Tel Aviv and New York. She presented solo museum exhibitions at the Katonah Museum of Art in Katonah, New York, the Bakersfield Museum of Art in Bakersfield, California and at the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRotem Reshef was born in Rehovot, Israel. Her maternal grandfather is the Zionist leader Moshe Smilansky. Her parents are Yehezkel (Hezi) Avivi, honorary citizen of Rehovot  and Tsila Avivi. She has two siblings; her brother is the film producer Gidi Avivi. She attended and graduated from the HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts, Ramat HaSharon (1985–1988). During her studies, she was the recipient of the America-Israel Cultural Foundation (AICF) Sharett Prize for Young Artists. She took part in a group exhibition of the awarded artists at the Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art She received her Master's in Museology from Reinwardt Academie, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2002–2004).\nIn 2010, Reshef won the Arte Laguna Prize. Her paintings covered two of the winery's bottle labels. Her work, “Deep”, was awarded an honorable mention in the London International Creative Competition (LICC) in 2014. She participated as an artist-in-residence at the following institutes: in 2015 at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, in 2021 at Residency Unlimited and in 2022 at The New York Art Residency and Studios (NARS) Foundation, both in Brooklyn, New York.\nMurals by her are on permanent display in Detroit, Michigan and in Zaritsky Artists’ House in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRotem Reshef is married to Shai Reshef, the founder and president of the University of the People. She has four grown-up children.\n\n\n== Artistic tradition and practice ==\nIn an article about Reshef in Haaretz, Prof. Avraham Balaban characterized her as a student of Raffi Lavie from the Want of Matter art school, who took the opposite path and followed Ofakim Hadashim school of Joseph Zaritsky, an Abstract Artist, painted in a vivid abundance colors. Her style brings to mind Action Painting or Process Art, which works in two and three-dimensional forms in sculptural painting installations. Her work is based on the tradition of Jackson Pollock, following the footsteps of Katharina Grosse’s site-specific installations and Sam Gilliam’s large-scale indoor/outdoor works. Reshef's installations are site-specific and relate to the surroundings of the exhibition space. She used to collect foliage and place them on a scroll, according to her scheme. The Curator and art critic, Peter Frank wrote: “In her painting installations, Reshef looks for circumstances, historical and contemporary. And in those circumstances, she identifies social and economic factors…  Reshef alludes to discrete but simultaneous conditions and standpoints, not to judge them so much as to share them with us so as to prompt our own investigation. Reshef provides the metaphors, we pursue the comprehensions… She seeks… to… translating a social and scientific discourse into aesthetic sensation.” \n\n\n== Bodies of work and exhibitions ==\nIn earlier works, starting in 2010, Reshef used a painting technique in diluted acrylic paint and intuitive work without brushes. For her first installation exhibition in Art Space TLV in 2016, Sagi Refael, the exhibition's curator, named it \"Control | Release,\" a method of painting described her creation style ever since. It comprised 44 meters (142 feet) of painting scrolls hung from the ceiling to the floor and surrounding the gallery. In 2017, Reshef installed her wide-ranging composition “Time Traveler” in a solo exhibition at the Tall Wall Space in the University of La Verne, California. Photographer and videographer Eric Minh Swenson documented the formation of that composition on-site. \"Time Traveler\" was created with six scrolls of paintings interwoven horizontally and vertically into a color-blended big grid. Symbolizing the passage of time, the four seasons interlaced to create a cohesive tapestry in the entire installation. The canvases were rendered with diverse techniques, colors, and ambiance, reflecting our period and inundated by images from all directions. The six scroll paintings are blended in a clash of simultaneous climates, denoting the climate change phenomenon as rain and storms in the summer and heat waves in the winter. “Time Traveler” was in a new contour at the Kwan Fong Art Gallery at California Lutheran University, renamed “Time Traveler: Part ll - Compass”, as a more political expansion of the original artwork. By \"Compass\", Reshef offers the viewers inner introspection in an era of visionless leaders who cannot navigate their countries and communities onto havens. The artwork rendered a sanctuary of silent observation and vast interpretations to the viewers, suggesting that they follow their path and inner passions and not necessarily the objectives politicians acquaint them.\nIn the summer of 2018, Reshef presented two new bodies of work: the outdoor installation “Intervals” on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists’ House in Tel Aviv and “Spectrum” at the Soho House in West Hollywood, California. “Spectrum” manifested Reshef's interest in the process of art making and in different ways to depict the elusive nature of the passing time and the fleeting seasons. The 22 paintings in this series presented monochromatic stages inspired by the different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, accentuating the existing yet invisible rays of light. The ultraviolet radiation waves are on the shorter end of the spectrum, while the infrared wave of light is on the longer end. These ends also mark the shifting tonalities and full range of hues between warm colors of reds and yellows to cold colors of blues and purples, sensualizing a change of moods and atmospheres, from somber to cheerful, from coolness to passion.\nBetween 2018 and 2024, Reshef exhibited four site-specific outdoor murals on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists׳ House in Tel Aviv. The first mural, \"Intervals\" (2018), presented an optical illusion with twenty faux \"windows\" revealing bold, abstract monochromatic paintings. Embodying tonal transitions from warm to cool colors, these works illuminated an atmosphere scale in passing the seasons through the shades, temperatures, and emotional qualities affected by shortening and lengthening cycles of hours and days during the year. Reshef's second mural project at the Artists’ House, “Eden in Two Acts” (2019), was split into two parts and responded to the second round of the Israeli legislative election in September 2019. In 2020, Reshef presented the painting installation: \"A Heartfelt Event\" in The Lab, Tel Aviv. The work was accompanied by a sound composition based on a voice recording from the protests against Benjamin Netanyahu that Reshef collected near the Prime Minister's Residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem in the summer of 2020. In October 2022, she staged her third mural, \"Encore: At the Rate of a Heartbeat,\" on Tel Aviv's Artists House façade, a few weeks before the third round of the Israeli legislative election in November 2022. Alongside Reshef's immersive painting installations, she continued developing her \"imprinting\" paintings, which resulted in her \"Ghost Libraries\" and \"Fossil\" series of 2017–2018 and \"Habitat\" of 2019.\nIn October 2019, Reshef presented her solo exhibition \"Arcadia,\" a painting installation at the Katonah Museum of Art, Katonah, New York. She was referring to Nicolas Poussin's painting Et in Arcadia ego. The installation deals with the tension between the picturesque landscape and environment of the museum's natural surroundings, the potential of turmoil, and the suspended belligerence below the surface, both in American and Israeli societies. \nIn June 2022, Reshef presented the installation \"Passage\" at the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv. The installation aimed to elevate the awareness of human impact on the environment and encourage nature conservation. To create \"Passage,\" Reshef used trimmings from Tel Aviv's parks and the Tel Aviv University's botanical garden near the museum. She alludes to the museum's laboratories and depicts its libraries. In October 2022, she presented “Terra Incognita”, her first ceramic installation, as part of a group exhibition at the Center for the Arts at Towson University, which was chosen as one of the ten best Baltimore exhibitions by BmoreArt magazine. Art critic Fanni Somogyi wrote: “As I look at it, I yearn for the smell of wet grass and freshly dug up earth… I’m drawn to the way this sculpture holds memory for both the artist and the viewer.” \nIn 2023, Reshef presented her site-specific installation \"Vista\" at the Bakersfield Museum of Art, Bakersfield, California. She was fascinated by the Panorama Vista Preserve, Bakersfield, and how it merges with Kern River Oil Field. She amassed permitted native foliage (trees, shrubs, and flowers) and then imprinted parts on the canvases. Curator Peter Frank wrote: “With “Vista,” Rotem Reshef portrays Bakersfield – from the inside out. Reshef does not simply look at the city, she re-embodies its salience. “Vista” brings forth the inner dynamic of a municipality that encompasses and embraces both nature and industry, a town in which extractive commerce is integral to the ecosphere. Reshef does not judge this reality, but recapitulates it, presenting – re-presenting... she seeks... to... translating a social and scientific discourse into aesthetic sensation\".\nIn 2024, Reshef presented her \"Family of Earth\" exhibition at Moshe Smilansky's Culture House, Municipal Gallery in Rehovot, Israel. The exhibition deals with Moshe Smilansky, Reshef's maternal grandfather and one of the founders of Rehovot, his Zionist vision and its partial fulfillment in current Israel reality alongside its partial clashing with it, and the generation gap.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Solo Exhibitions ==\n2009    Orange Sunset, The Heder Gallery, Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n2010    Breadths of Spirit, Artists ́ House, Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n2015    Making a Mark, School of Visual Arts, New York, New York.\n2016    Control l Release, Art Space TLV, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n2016    Phantom Stream, dual exhibition, Kibbutz Be'eri Gallery, Israel.\n2017    Time Traveler, University of La Verne, California.\n2017    Something Blue, Alessandro Berni Gallery, New York, New York.\n2018    Time Traveler Part II: Compass, California Lutheran University, Kwan Fong Gallery, Thousand Oaks, California.\n2018    Intervals, outdoor mural, Artist House, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n2018    Spectrum, Soho House West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.\n2019    Eden in Two Acts, outdoor mural, Artists House, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n2019    Arcadia, Katonah Museum of Art, Bedford, New York.\n2020    A Heartfelt Event, The Lab, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n2022    Passage, Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv, Israel.\n2022    Walking on Dry Land, The Laurie M.

It takes its name from a famous French speleologist: Félix Trombe.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe réseau Félix-Trombe is located on the Arbas massif in the Pyrénées, south of the département in the région Occitanie.\n\n\n== The network ==\nThe Félix-Trombe network is the longest underground network in France with 117 kilometres of galleries and 59 entrances. It is a complex cavity due to its significant overall difference in altitude (1,001 metres) and its numerous entrances.\n\nThe main cavities that make up this network are: :\nAlso included are: :\n\n\n== Full traversal (2001) ==\nOn 15 and 16 September 2001 in 22 hours, about twenty cavers travelled the entire network from the former highest point (the Gouffre de la Coquille) to the lowest point of the network (the Goueil di Her).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of caves in France\nList of caves\nList of longest caves\nSpeleology\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"Equipements en fixe\", novembre 2018 sur CDS31.net\nFélix, Trombe (1998).

        "content": "Shoshkakol (Kazakh: Шошқакөл; Russian: Шошкаколь) is a lake in Zhanaarka District, Ulytau Region, and Nura District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan.\nThe border between Ulytau and Karaganda regions runs across the lake from northwest to southeast. Aynabulak village is located 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) to the southeast of the lake. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nShoshkakol is an endorheic lake. Two rivers of the Nura basin, the Kulanotpes and the Sonaly, flow northwards close to the lake basin. The lake is roughly square-shaped and has a fairly large island, —Araltobe with a length of 1.5 kilometers (0.93 mi) and a width of 1.1 kilometers (0.68 mi), in the southern half. The lakeshores are flat and sandy, overgrown with grass. Lake Sulukol lies 50 kilometers (31 mi) to the east.  \nShoshkakol is a drying lake. Its water level has dropped significantly in recent decades and currently there are only two residual pools left. Most of the remaining surface of the lake is marshy, encumbered with aquatic vegetation. The lake water is saline and bitter.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nShoshkakol is surrounded by highland steppe. Reeds cover most of the shallow parts of the surface. Migratory birds, such as ducks, swans and geese, nest at the lake in the spring season.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shoshkakol at Wikimedia Commons\nDrying Lakes: A Review On The Health Conditions and Restoration Strategies",

        "content": "This is a list of human deaths caused by dogs, which have been documented through news media, reports, cause-of-death statistics, scientific papers, or other sources. The attribution of the dog type or breed is assigned by the sources. For additional information on causes of death and studies related to fatalities resulting from dog bites or attacks, see Fatal dog attacks.\nBrazil is moving closer to the goal of eliminating deaths due to dog-mediated rabies. Since 1983 the incidence of dog-borne rabies has decreased by almost 98% with only six reported cases in 2021. Between 2010 and 2021, 39 cases of human rabies transmitted by various species were recorded. The last reported fatality due to dog transmitted rabies happened in 2010 in Ceará.\nIn 2023, the number of fatalities due to dog attacks increased significantly. São Paulo recorded the highest number of cases in the country, with 19 deaths, representing a 137.5% increase compared to the previous year. Rio Grande do Sul saw 7 deaths, reflecting a 40% increase, while Goiás experienced a 200% increase.\nIn April 2024, in response to a series of severe and fatal dog attacks, Member of Parliament Julio Cesar Ribeiro introduced an amendment to the penal code aimed at regulating such incidents. The proposed amendment suggests that walking certain dogs in public spaces without a muzzle should be deemed a criminal offense, carrying a potential prison sentence ranging from 15 days to 6 months. Ribeiro emphasized that these measures are not intended to penalize the dogs themselves but rather to hold owners accountable for failing to take necessary precautions to ensure community safety. Concerned about the increase in dog attacks and deaths Member of Parliament Mário Heringer pushes for a change in the law for some time. His drafted legislation (PL 7316) requires owners of specific dogs to possess a certificate of ownership for their animals. Furthermore, the draft proposes mandates for the containment of dogs within private properties through the use of appropriate gates and fences, aiming to prevent their presence on public roads. Criminal liability in the event of attacks is also addressed in the proposed legislation.\n\n\n== Summary counts of fatalities by year ==\nOfficial deaths per year from the Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Ministry of Health (Brazil):\n\n\n== Fatalities in 2024 ==\n\n\n== Fatalities in 2023 ==\n\n\n== Fatalities in 2022 ==\n\n\n== Fatalities in 2021 ==\n\n\n== Fatalities from 2000 to 2020 ==\n\n\n== Fatalities before 2000 ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRoberta Ribeiro Fernandes, Bruna Menegate Nascimento, Maisa Martins Quirilos Assis, Melissa Marchi Zaniolo, Willian Fontini Marangon, Luciana Kazue Otutumi, Daniela Dib Gonçalves, Ana Maria Quessada (2023). \"Acidentes por agressões de cães no Brasil\".

Alfred Harcourt, who was in the play, had a brief connection with Deeming.\nIt ran for over six weeks in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Age observed \" The temptation to tickle further the appetite of the public for tbe grim and ghastly was too powerful to resist.\"\nThe Argus said \" Apart from an unnecessary degree of attention being given to its more repulsive aspects the play is a fair one of its class, and was both well mounted and well played.\" \n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nACT 1 - A TERRIBLE CRIME. \"Throw Guilt upon the Soul, And like a stone cast on the troubled waters of a lake, 'Twill form in circles, round succeeding round, Each' wider than the first.\" - The Murder in the Heathstone\nACT 2 - VOICES FROM THE TOMB. \"Swathe the vile budy in the softest silks, Yet leave the conscience shuddering nakedly.\" - Midnight Mysteries.\nACT 3 - FOLLOWING THE TRAIL. \"Thou fool, The avenging deities are shed with wool.\" In full cry.\nACT 4 - A DESPERATE MAN. \"Turns like the baited wolf, and blind with blood, Rends all in fierce despair.\" Through perils manifold.\nACT 5 - THE IRON HAND. WINDSOR. \" Whose sheddeth man's blood, By man shall his blood be shed.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWilful Murder at Ausstage",

        "content": "The McGill University pro-Palestinian encampment is an ongoing occupation protest which has been taking place on the downtown campus of McGill University, in Montreal, since 27 April 2024. It was the first notable Canadian demonstration in the 2024 movement of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, which call for universities to cut ties with Israel amid the country's assault on Gaza in the Israel–Hamas war. Like many of its predecessors, the protest at McGill takes the form of an encampment, a group of tents occupied day and night by protesters.\nThe encampment was organized by a collective of pro-Palestinian student groups from McGill and the nearby Concordia University. Their demands were for those universities to cut ties with Israel, including by divesting from Israel-related funds such as weapons manufacturers. Roughly 20 tents were initially set up close to the Roddick Gates and encircled by a metal fence. In the following days, the encampment grew to roughly 100 tents. It is equipped with various amenities and hosts daily activities related to the protest. Students and faculty from various Montreal universities, which also include the Université du Québec à Montréal and Université de Montréal, occupy the tents.\nMcGill University has stated that the encampment is illegal and has requested police assistance to dismantle it. The university's president, Deep Saini, accused protesters of antisemitism, which they have denied. As of yet, Montreal's police department has not attempted to dismantle the encampment, which has been repeatedly described as peaceful. The Superior Court of Quebec rejected an injunction request against the protest, which had been filed on behalf of two students who described a hostile climate around the encampment. The premier of Quebec, François Legault, has joined McGill in declaring the encampment illegal and requesting police intervention. The encampment's members have stated their intention to remain on site until their demands are met.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Student groups ===\nSince the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October 2023, student groups at Montreal's two English-language universities, McGill and Concordia, have taken on a visible role as they have held protests and demonstrations in support of either Palestine or Israel. On 8 November 2023, an altercation erupted at Concordia after two student groups, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) Concordia and StartUp Nation, set up neighbouring kiosks in a common space. The former was raising funds for the Gaza humanitarian crisis while the latter sought to raise awareness about hostages held by Hamas. Three injuries were reported and a student was arrested. On 19 December, McGill removed the university's name from its chapter of SPHR after reviewing a since-deleted social media post describing the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 as \"heroic\".\n\n\n=== Protests against McGill's investments ===\nAt McGill University, pro-Palestinian groups have protested against the institution's investments in Israel-related funds, including weapons manufacturers. In a referendum held on 20 November 2024, 78% of participating students voted in favour of a policy calling on the university to cut ties with companies \"complicit in genocide\", as well as condemn Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip. McGill threatened to end its agreement with its student union, the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU), if the latter ratified the policy. This agreement includes the SSMU's funding and their use of the McGill name. The Superior Court of Quebec halted the adoption of the policy after an injunction was filed by a student. On 19 February 2024, a small group of McGill students began a hunger strike to call on the university to divest from Israel. A protester who did not eat for 34 days was eventually sent to the hospital. On 22 February, demonstrators blocked the entrances of McGill's Bronfman building, where the Desautels Faculty of Management is located, to protest against that particular faculty's investments in Israel.\n\n\n==== Composition of McGill's endowment fund ====\n\nOn 18 April 2024, two of McGill's pro-Palestinian student groups published a data set compiling 50 Israel-related companies that the university held investments in as of 31 December 2023. These investments, which were publicly disclosed on McGill's website, totalled at least $73 million. Of this amount, more than $5.5 million were invested in military technology companies which have contracts with the IDF, including Lockheed Martin, Thales, Safran, Dassault, Airbus and BAE Systems. Multiple other companies who operate in Israeli settlements, as well as large Canadian banks, listed because of their own investments in weapons manufacturers, appear in the data set. McGill's endowment fund, which is managed by external fund managers hired by the institution, is worth about $1.8 billion in total. As for Concordia University, it does not publicly disclose its investments.\n\n\n=== Encampment protests in the United States ===\n\nOn 17 April 2024, students at Columbia University, in New York City, set up an encampment on their campus as a form of occupation protest against their university's investments in Israel. The next day, Columbia president Minouche Shafik summoned the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to dismantle the encampment, leading to the arrest of over 100 protesters. The event garnered national attention and sparked the creation of pro-Palestinian encampments across the country and the world.\n\n\n== Organizing ==\nPro-Palestinian students in Montreal were directly inspired by the movement of encampment protests taking shape in the United States. The McGill encampment, nicknamed the \"liberated zone\", was first announced on social media by the McGill and Concordia chapters of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR). McGill and Concordia chapters of the group Independent Jewish Voices were also organizers.\n\n\n=== First day ===\nOn the morning of 27 April 2024, a Saturday, the McGill administration sent a communique to students in response to social media posts announcing the encampment on campus. The email informed them that encampments were \"not permitted on our campus\" and that they \"can create serious health and safety concerns while increasing the potential for escalation and confrontation\". McGill did not initially state whether it would ask for the tents to be forcibly removed.\n\nThat same day, sometime after 1:30 PM, around 20 tents were erected on the field behind the Roddick Gates, the main entrance to the McGill campus. Tall metal fences were set up around the encampment and decorated with signs and flags. More than 100 protesters attended the construction process. Sometime before 3:30 PM, another larger group of demonstrators, which had been marching down Rue Sherbrooke, reached the encampment. Much of the group left campus by 7:30 PM. It rained on the first night of the occupation protest.\nNews media have described the McGill pro-Palestinian encampment as the first of its kind in Canada, although social media posts document a small set of tents on the campus of the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, on 22 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Demands ===\n\nAs is the case for other student protests sparked by the Israel-Hamas war, the McGill encampment demands that the universities of McGill and Concordia cut financial and academic ties with Israel. This entails the divestment from Israel-related funds, including weapons manufacturers doing business with the IDF and companies operating in Israeli-occupied territories, as well as the cutting of ties with Israeli universities. Additional demands include a public condamnation the Israeli assault on Gaza and the pressuring of the Canadian government in regards to its military ties with Israel, as well as the protection of students' right to protest. In general, the encampment is also described as an act of solidarity with Palestine.\n\n\n== Encampment ==\n\n\n=== Location and members ===\n\nThe \"liberated zone\" is located on the lower field of McGill's campus in downtown Montreal, behind its main entrance through the Roddick Gates, on Rue Sherbrooke. On 1 May 2024, it covered an area of approximately 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). From the initial 20 or so tents, it had grown to about 100 tents by 3 May 2024. The encampment is mostly inhabited by students from McGill and Concordia, who organized the protest, although Montreal's French-language universities, the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and Université de Montréal, are also represented. A group of roughly 100 professors also take turns sleeping at the encampment, providing help in the form of advice or laundry services, among other things. Besides the campers, many visitors also spend time on site and drop off supplies.\n\n\n=== Structure and installation ===\nAccording to protesters, the encampment has developed an organizational structure, including a code of conduct with rules addressing issues such as hate speech and discrimination. Campers hold a general assembly every morning, discussing the current events in Gaza and other subjects related to the protest.\n\nThe protesters' tents are located inside a fenced-in area. The makeshift barricade was reinforced in the first week, after key figures called on the encampment to be dismantled. Reporters are not allowed past the fences. In front of the entrance, protesters welcome visitors coming to drop off supplies, which can include food, batteries, clothes, medicine and rain boots. The exterior portion of the encampment was extended with sun shelters, kiosks and a small stage where a microphone and speakers can be installed. A \"free store\" serves coffee, food and rain gear. Because of a largely rainy first week, campers dug trenches, scooped water out with plastic pitchers and placed wooden pallets over the muddy lawn to provide walkways between the tents. Other amenities in the encampment include a library, a medical tent with trained personnel, community and prayer spaces, a generator and portable toilets. Montreal's fire department, the Service de sécurité incendie de Montréal (SIM), inspected the encampment and concluded that it was safe.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nMany activities are held in and around the encampment. They have included poetry readings, music performances, lectures on Palestinian history, celebrations of Passover, debates, discussions and quilting. A large screen has been set up outside of the encampment for films to be screened on. Palestinian films and The Battle of Algiers (1966) have been shown. A play zone for kids to make crafts was also set up on some days. On 5 May 2024, Red Dress Day in Canada, events were planned to commemorate missing and murdered Indigenous women. Organizers publish a schedule of activities daily.\n\n\n== Unfolding ==\n\n\n=== Response from McGill University ===\n\nOn the first day of the protest, before tents were set up, McGill emailed a communique to students stating that encampments were \"not permitted\". After the tents were installed, McGill representatives requested for them to be removed, which protesters refused to do. That day, McGill declined to state whether the tents would be forcibly removed and did not request police assistance, according to Montreal's police department, the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).\nTwo days later, on 29 April 2024, McGill stated that the situation had \"shifted significantly\". It said the encampment, which had tripled in size since the first day, was largely occupied by non-McGill students and that it violated both university policy and the law. McGill's president, Deep Saini, denounced \"obvious antisemitism\" among protesters. The university further stated it was reviewing \"video evidence of some people using unequivocally antisemitic language and intimidating behaviour\", but did not initially disclose such evidence to journalists. At 4 PM, a spokesperson for McGill security handed protesters pamphlets asking them to disperse. He later returned to issue a \"final warning\" and stated the university could call the police. Later that day, McGill requested police assistance to the SPVM. As of yet, the department has not complied with the request.\nThe following day, on 30 April 2024, Saini reiterated that the dismantlement of the encampment was \"non-negotiable\". He committed to hold a forum with protesters, if they left campus, to discuss their demands \"in a peaceful, respectful and civilized manner\". A spokesperson for the protesters said the offer wasn't \"serious\" and that they would stay until they \"see a divestment\".\n\n\n=== Security, legality and policing ===\nThe SPVM has repeatedly described the McGill encampment as peaceful. As of 8 May 2024, no incident had been reported on site. On 30 April 2024, one of the SPVM's spokespeople stated that the situation on campus was a civil matter and that \"no crime [was] being committed\".\nOn the first day of the encampment, several police vehicles were parked within sight of the site, although McGill's campus security was reportedly the entity in charge of the situation. On the evening of 1 May 2024, two minibuses of police officers in riot gear, who had been in downtown Montreal because of an unrelated protest, stopped in front of the encampment site for about 25 minutes. The following day, due to a planned pro-Israel counter-protest, dozens of police officers on bikes and horseback were deployed. On 6 May 2024, campus security and the police intercepted and seized supplies, such as N95 masks and sleeping bags, brought by supporters.\n\n\n=== Injunction request ===\nOn 30 April 2024, an injunction request against the encampment was filed on behalf of two McGill students, one of them Jewish and the other Muslim. They alleged that chants from the protest, such as \"Long live the intifada\" and \"Zionists are racist\", created a hostile climate on campus and said that they were fearful. The temporary injunction would have prevented members from five pro-Palestinian groups, including SPHR, to protest within 100 metres of any of the 154 McGill buildings, for a period of 10 days.\n27 videos were included with the request. One of them, which McGill shared with news media and stated they were \"investigating\" due to antisemitism, shows protesters chanting \"Go back to Europe\". A social media post, the video includes text which refers to them as \"Jihadists\". Members of the encampment stated the protesters in the video were not part of their group, and news media were not able to verify if the events occurred in the context of the encampment.\nIn a 10-page decision, Justice Chantal Masse of the Superior Court of Quebec denied the injunction request, writing that the safety concerns expressed by the students were “relating more to subjective fears and discomfort than to precise and serious fears for their security”. She also wrote that \"the balance of inconveniences leans more toward the protesters, whose freedom of expression and to gather peacefully would be affected significantly\". She invited pro-Palestinian protesters to better choose their words and to \"dispense with those that could be perceived [...] as calls to violence or antisemitic\", while maintaining \"their anti-war message\".\n\n\n=== Counter-protest ===\nOn 2 May 2024, a pro-Israeli counter-protest took place outside of the Roddick Gates, within sight of the encampment. About 100 people attended, while about 400 were on the pro-Palestinian side. Dozens of riot police officers were deployed. The pro-Israeli protesters projected a looping documentary on the Hamas-led attack on Israel on a large screen and played Hebrew-language music. There were no incidents or arrests associated with the confrontation.\n\n\n== Responses ==\n\n\n=== From political figures ===\nOn 2 May 2024, François Legault, the premier of Quebec, stated that the encampment was illegal and that it should be dismantled by the SPVM. He was criticized for his position, including by Quebec's federation of university professors, the FQPPU. François Bonnardel and Pascale Déry, ministers in Legault's government, also said the encampment was illegal. Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, said the protesters should leave the site. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, defended their right to protest but said he was worried about a \"threat towards Jewish students\". Anthony Housefather, a Liberal MP from the Montreal region, published a video calling for the encampment to be dismantled on the day it was set up. Politician supporters of the encampment include Housefather's Liberal colleague, Salma Zahid. Amir Khadir and Haroun Bouazzi, two politicians associated with the provincial party Québec solidaire, visited the encampment site.\n\n\n=== Allegations of antisemitism ===\nDeep Saini and the McGill administration have condemned alleged antisemitism in the encampment. The Jewish organization B'nai Brith Canada associated the encampment with a \"rising tide of antisemitism\". A video shared by McGill shows a group of protesters chanting \"Go back to Europe\" on campus. Members of the encampment stated these protesters were not part of their group. They have rejected claims of antisemitism and said the protest was interfaith. A Jewish professor at McGill was among those who argued the term was weaponized by opponents \"to prevent us from criticizing Israel\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This list is incomplete. \n\n\n== In House Works and Collaborations ==\nMusicals have also been performed throughout the years based upon people and events in American, European, and Asian history. Among the more recognizable of these biographical adaptations are Last Party: S. Fitzgerald's Last Day, about F. Scott Fitzgerald; Valentino, about Rudolph Valentino; Dean, about James Dean; and Saint-Exupéry: The Pilot Who Became \"The Little Prince\", about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.\nFinally, original stories round out Takarazuka fare, including musicals such as Boxman by the Cosmos Troupe, Too Short a Time to Fall in Love performed by the Star and Moon Troupes, and Silver Wolf by the Moon and Snow Troupes.\nTakarazuka has occasionally worked with notable writers, composers, and choreographers to create original content for the revue. In 1993, Tommy Tune wrote, directed and choreographed the revue Broadway Boys to accompany the Moon Troupe's rendition of Grand Hotel. In 2006, Takarazuka worked with Frank Wildhorn, musical writer and composer of Jekyll & Hyde and The Scarlet Pimpernel, to create  Never Say Goodbye for the Cosmos Troupe. In 2019, Takarazuka worked with Dove Attia, music producer of 1789: Les Amants de la Bastille and La Légende du roi Arthur, to compose Casanova for the Flower Troupe.\n\n\n== Japanese Adaptations ==\nStories based in Japan and modeled on historical accounts or traditional tales are often referred to as nihonmono (日本物)or, less frequently, wamono (和物). Among the most common of these adapted to the Takarazuka stage is The Tale of Genji.\nPopular manga series have often shaped Takarazuka, such as in the case of Riyoko Ikeda's The Rose of Versailles. Other manga adaptations include The Window of Orpheus, also by Ikeda, Osamu Tezuka's Black Jack and Phoenix, and Yasuko Aoike's El Halcón.\nRecent examples of works adapted from Japanese novels or short stories include Moon Troupe's Osaka Samurai (大阪侍), based upon the short story by Ryōtarō Shiba and Flower Troupe's Black Lizard (黒蜥蜴, Kurotokage), based upon the Kogoro Akechi story by Edogawa Rampo.\nIn 2009, Takarazuka Revue performed two shows based on an adaptation of Capcom's video game series Ace Attorney.They took the stage in January 2013 to represent the courtroom game again with the production titled Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney 3. In June 2013, the Revue would debut at Tokyo's Tokyu Theatre Orb an adaptation of another Capcom video game, Sengoku Basara, done by the Flower Troupe. This focused on character Yukimura Sanada, played by Tomu Ranju, the same actress who had taken the role of Phoenix Wright prior to becoming a top star.\nIn 2017, the Flower Troupe performed a stage adaptation of the shōjo (girls') manga series Haikara-San: Here Comes Miss Modern, and performed it again in 2020. In 2019, the Flower Troupe also performed a stage adaptation of the shōjo manga series Boys Over Flowers. In August 2022, the Cosmos Troupe performed a stage adaptation of the series High&Low in collaboration with LDH.\n\n\n== Western Adaptations ==\n\n\n== Adaptations of other Asian Works ==\nAmong works adapted from other Asian sources is the Beijing opera The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell, detailing the romance between General Xiang Yu and his lover, Madam Yu.",

        "content": "Postcards is a 2024 Nigerian-Indian Netflix series created by Hamisha Daryani Ahuja. Filmed in Lagos and Mumbai, the series is a cross-cultural venture between Nollywood and Bollywood and stars performers from both industries including Sola Sobowale, Richard Mofe Damijo, Tobi Bakre, Rahama Sadau, Rajneesh Duggal, and Nancy Isime.   Postcards is Ahuja's first major production since 2021's Namaste Wahala, and follows the lives of four Nigerians who discover love, acceptance, and prosperity in India after embarking on individual journeys of self-discovery whilst facing their trials and tribulations.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nPostcards follows the lives of four Nigerians in India. They are:\n\nBunmi (Sola Sobowale): Businesswoman and socialite Bunmi lives life to the fullest, a decision made following her husband's death twenty years prior, but despite her status on the Eko party circuit, she leads a secluded life. After a fibroids diagnosis in hospital, she flies to Mumbai where she befriends Siddharth (Rajneesh Duggal), an Indian surgeon married to a Nigerian woman. Fearing she will die in surgery, Bunmi yearns to make peace with Yemi, her estranged son with no solid career goals. Unbeknown to her, an Indian film producer (Hamisha Daryani Ahuja) has signed Yemi to appear in a Bollywood series after discovering his talent on video, and despite her close bond with Siddharth, Bunmi spends days pining for her only child.\nZainab (Rahama Sadau): Siddharth's Nigerian wife, Zainab, has resolved to never have children, a decision her husband initially supported, but his change of heart causes conflict in their marriage. Despite her mother-in-law's (Sheila Gore) disappointment and her friend Isioma's (Nancy Isime) intervention, Zainab remains resolute in her stance, citing financial strain, career restraints, and societal prejudice against mixed-race children as her reasons. Trouble ensues when Zainab suspects Siddharth is having an affair with Kareena (Lekha Prajapati), his flirtatious fellow doctor in whom he confides with his marriage crisis. Zainab—an old acquaintance of Bunmi's—soon discovers she is pregnant, and is contemplating an abortion without Siddharth's knowledge.\nOlumide (Richard Mofe Damijo): Bunmi's Mumbai-based brother, Olumide, is dedicated solely to his business, leaving no time for family or leisure (He puts up Bunmi in a hotel as opposed to accommodating her within his household). Olumide's only confidant, his accountant Kabir (Rio Kapaola), who constantly chides his bachelor lifestyle, escorts him to a property viewing where they spot Olumide's former love Rekha who had turned down his proposal years ago due to her parents' disapproval of interracial marriage, leaving him heartbroken. He is further distraught when her daughter, Leila, informs him that her mother is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and no longer recognises him. With his 60th birthday approaching, the surly Olumide realises that family is more valuable than wealth, and invites Bunmi to stay at his house following her successful surgery.\nYemi (Tobi Bakre): Despite running into a series of unfortunate events in Mumbai—including falling victim to an accommodation scam, and bullying from Rommy, a local actor threatened by his presence, (Chirag Bajaj)—Bunmi's son, Yemi, soon rises through the ranks. He is made a principal dancer in the Bollywood production, but soon comes to blows with Ronny on-set. Both their roles are on the line, but after other cast members—particularly Aarti (Gurleen Grewal), an actress Yemi has befriended—confirm Ronny's bullying, the latter is dismissed, and Yemi is delighted when he is offered a supporting role in an international series. His joy is short-lived when his manager Bolu (Ibrahim Suleman) calls from Nigeria to inform him of his mother's surgery. Filled with remorse at not contacting Bunmi earlier, Yemi resolves to become a better son.\nThe series ends with Olumide celebrating his 60th birthday. Kabir is unable to attend, but Bunmi—who has invited Siddharth and Zainab—is reunited with Yemi. Both mother and son resolve their differences (Bunmi had objected to his decision not to pursue further education, while Yemi had viewed her as unsupportive); Olumide apologises to Zainab for his own lack of support when she first relocated to India; Yemi—now his uncle's heir—agrees to enrol in college whilst pursuing his passion in entertainment; and Zainab—who decided against the abortion—announces her pregnancy.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSola Sobowale - Olubunmi (Bunmi)\nRichard Mofe Damijo - Olumide\nTobi Bakre - Yemi\nRajneesh Duggal - Dr. Siddharth\nRahama Sadau - Zainab\nRio Kapaola - Kabir\nNancy Isime - Isioma\nLeika Prajapati - Kareena\nChirag Bajaj - Ronny\nGurleen Grewal - Aarti\nTina Mba - Party Guest\nHamisha Daryani Ahuja - Film producer\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPostcards's reviews ranged from mixed to negative. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "There are many nicknames for the city of Indianapolis, the largest city in Indiana and 16th-largest city in the United States. The city's nicknames reflect its geography, economy, multicultural population, and popular culture, including sports and music. They are often used by the media and in popular culture to reference the city.\nThe city does not have an official nickname. However, it has adopted an official slogan, the \"Crossroads of America\", which is also the official state motto of Indiana. The city's most popular unofficial nickname is \"Indy\", an abbreviation capturing the first two syllables of Indianapolis.\n\n\n== Popular nicknames ==\n\n\n=== 317 ===\nEstablished in 1947, 317 is the area code for the Indianapolis area.\n\n\n=== Circle City ===\n\nThe \"Circle City\" nickname originates from the distinctive 1821 plan of Indianapolis by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham. The plan's focal point on a traffic circle Monument Circle (originally, Governor's Circle) is the traffic circle and focal point of the Mile Square plan of Indianapolis. Since 1902, Monument Circle has been home to the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument.\n\n\n=== Crossroads of America ===\n\n\"Crossroads of America\" was first used in reference to numerous railroads that intersected Indianapolis in the late 19th century. In the 20th century, the moniker evolved to reference the city's proximity to important highways. First adopted in 1937 as the state of Indiana's official state motto, it was later adopted as the city's official slogan in 1988.\n\n\n=== IND ===\n\"IND\" is the IATA airport code for Indianapolis International Airport and the Amtrak station code for Indianapolis Union Station. It is also used by scoreboard and/or statistics line abbreviations for sports franchises based in Indianapolis.\n\n\n=== Indy ===\n\nAn abbreviation capturing the first two syllables of IN-dee-ə-NAP-ə-lis, \"Indy\" is the city's most widely used nickname, commonly reflected in the names of public agencies (e.g., Indy Parks and IndyGo), events (e.g., Indy Film Fest and Indy Pride Festival), media (e.g., IndyStar), sports franchises (e.g., Indy Eleven and Indy Fuel), and the city's destination marketing organization, Visit Indy. The city's official website is indy.gov.\n\n\n=== Naptown ===\nThe term's original meaning is disputed. According to reporting from Indianapolis Monthly, the earliest reference to \"Naptown\" is from a 1927 Indianapolis Recorder article about jazz musicians. The term was coined as early as the 1920s by African American Jazz performers, stressing the fourth syllable in IN-dee-ə-NAP-ə-lis.\nThe term later evolved as a pejorative term for the city's perceived dullness. Humorist Will Rogers described the city as \"the only farm I've ever seen with a monument in the center\".\n\n\n== Historic nicknames ==\n\n\n=== City of Railroads ===\nThe nickname “City of Railroads” was first used in the Indianapolis Locomotive of September 1849, two years following the arrival of the Indianapolis and Madison Railroad and four years before the opening of the world's first union station in the city. It was frequently used through the 1870s.\n\n\n=== Indianoplace or India-no-place ===\nThese variations originated in the 1960s as pejorative terms referring to the city's perceived dullness or provincial attitudes.\n\n\n== Subculture and groups ==\n\n\n=== Chindianapolis ===\n\"Chindianapolis,\" a blending of Chin and Indianapolis, refers to the city's growing population of Chin people.\n\n\n=== No Mean City ===\n\n\"No Mean City\" originates from the Christian Bible (KJV), Acts 21:39: \"But Paul said, 'I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.'\" In this context, \"no mean city\" refers to a city that is not insignificant.\nIndianapolis resident and former U.S. president Benjamin Harrison borrowed the verse in a 1897 speech: \"I am, myself, a citizen of no mean city.\" This was later echoed by local politicians, including Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter (1901–1903; 1906–1910). On July 27, 1909, Bookwalter presided over ceremonies for the cornerstone laying of the new City Hall, inscribed with President Harrison's quote.\nThe slogan resurfaced in 2015 by opponents of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, invoking \"No Mean City\" to represent a welcoming and inclusive city.\n\n\n== Marketing slogans ==\n\n\n=== Amateur Sports Capital of the World ===\nThe \"Amateur Sports Capital of the World\" moniker came to prominence in the 1980s as the city promoted itself as a sports tourism destination, amidst capital investments in sports facilities and bids to host major events. Several amateur sports associations have been or are currently based in the city, including the Amateur Athletic Union (1970–1996), the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Federation of State High School Associations (1999–present).\n\n\n=== Cinderella of the Rust Belt ===\n\"Cinderella of the Rust Belt\" was coined by Newsweek in its September 9, 1985, issue. The brief article, \"A Rust-Belt Relic's New Shine,\" featured local leaders and touted revitalization efforts underway in Indianapolis at the time.\n\n\n=== Racing Capital of the World ===\n\nAn official trademark of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the \"Racing Capital of the World\" is sometimes extended to the city of Indianapolis or the state of Indiana. Indianapolis is a global center for auto racing, home to numerous motorsports facilities and events, two sanctioning bodies (INDYCAR and United States Auto Club), and more than 500 motorsports-related companies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of city nicknames in Indiana\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Heather Morris (born 1953) is an Australian author born in New Zealand. Her 2018 debut novel was The Tattooist of Auschwitz.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nHeather Morris was born in 1953 in Te Awamutu on the North Island of New Zealand. She later moved with her family to the town of Pirongia, and  graduated from Te Awamutu High School. In interviews, she stated that as a child she knew nothing about the Holocaust.\nIn 1971, she moved to Melbourne; there she met and married Steve Morris in 1973. In 1975, she returned to New Zealand with her husband and settled  in Christchurch. Their first son was born in 1976, their second son in 1980, and their daughter in1985.\nShe began studying at the University of Canterbury in 1986 but returned to Melbourne in 1987 and graduated from Monash University with a BA in Political Science and Sociology in 1991. In 1995, she began working as an office manager in the social work department at the Monash Medical Center in Melbourne, where she remained until 2017.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1996, Morris enrolled in a professional writing course at the Australian College of Journalism. She has participated in screenwriting lectures, seminars and creative workshops both in Australia and the US. Her first script was reviewed by the Oscar-winning author and screenwriter Pamela Wallace.\nIn 2003, she met and befriended Lale Sokolov, two months after the death of his wife, Gita. He was 87 years old at the time. For the next three years, until his death in 2006, Lale told her details about his life during the Holocaust and his work as a tattooist in the Auschwitz concentration camp, a job he had been assigned to by the camp's S.S. administrators. Based on his stories, Morris later wrote The Tattooist of Auschwitz, initially as a screenplay. Although the screenplay was optioned by an Australian film company, the company did not exercise its right and the option lapsed after six years. She then entered her work in international competitions where she won many honours including the International Independent Film Awards in 2016.\nEventually, Morris was persuaded by her sister-In-law to rewrite the screenplay as a novel, which she titled The Tattooist of Auschwitz. The book, released in 2018, became a bestseller. It was published in over 50 countries around the world and sold tens of millions of copies. In 2018, it was #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list and #1 on The New York Times international bestseller list. In 2024, the book was adapted into the TV series The Tattooist of Auschwitz, with Harvey Keitel as Lale Sokolov and Melanie Lynskey as Morris.\nHer second book, the sequel to The Tattooist from Auschwitz, Cilka's Journey, was released in 2020 and tells the story of Cilka Kovacova, who was 16 when she arrived in Auschwitz and became the camp commandant's mistress. After her release from the camp she was arrested and sent to the Gulag in Russia where she met her husband Ivan and fled to Canada. As part of the research work for the book, Morris visited Slovakia four times and researched the life of Kovacova. She also visited Yad Vashem to further research the Holocaust. Kovacova's stepson, George Kovach from  California, sued Morris upon the publication of the book, because according to him the story is \"hurtful\" and blurring the boundaries of fact and fiction.\nThe third book in the trilogy Three Sisters, about three sisters who together survive Auschwitz, arrive in Slovakia and immigrate to Israel, was released in 2021.\nHer latest book from 2023, Sisters Under the Rising Sun is about women in the Japanese labor camps in Indonesia during World War II.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== The Tattooist of Auschwitz trilogy ===\n2017 - The Tattooist of Auschwitz, Bonnier Publishing Fiction\n2019 - Cilka's Journey, St. Martin's Publishing Group\n2021 - Three Sisters, Center Point Large Print\n\n\n=== Other novels ===\n2020 - Stories of Hope, Bonnier Books UK\n2022 - Listening Well St. Martin's Publishing Group\n2023 - Sisters Under the Rising Sun, St. Martin's Publishing Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "HMS Stonehenge was an Admiralty S-class destroyer that served with the Royal Navy during the twentieth century. The S class was a development of the R class created during the First World War as a cheaper alternative to the V and W class. Launched after Armistice that ended the war, the ship was commissioned in 1919 and joined the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla. The vessel supported the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and then British forces assisting the partition of the Ottoman Empire, being based at Constantinople in 1920. In that year, the destroyer ran aground off the coast of Smyrna while on a routine mission. Despite attempts by sister ship Serapis to refloat the stricken vessel, Stonehenge had to be abandoned, although no one died in the accident. The remains were sold in 1921.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nStonehenge was one of 33 Admiralty S-class destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty on 7 April 1917 during the First World War as part of the Eleventh War Construction Programme. The design was a development of the R class introduced at the same time as, and as a cheaper and faster alternative to, the V and W class. Differences with the R class were minor, such as having the searchlight moved aft and being designed to mount an additional pair of torpedo tubes.\nThe destroyer had a overall length of 276 ft (84.1 m) and a length of 265 ft (80.8 m) between perpendiculars. Beam was 26 ft 8 in (8.1 m) and mean draught 9 ft 10 in (3 m). Displacement was 1,075 long tons (1,092 t) normal and 1,221 long tons (1,241 t) deep load. Three Yarrow boilers fed steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines rated at 27,000 shaft horsepower (20,000 kW) and driving two shafts, giving a design speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph) at normal loading and 32.5 knots (60.2 km/h; 37.4 mph) at deep load. Two funnels were fitted. A full load of 301 long tons (306 t) of fuel oil was carried, which gave a design range of 2,750 nautical miles (5,090 km; 3,160 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The ship had a complement of 90 officers and ratings.\nArmament consisted of three QF 4 in (102 mm) Mk IV guns on the ship's centreline. One was mounted raised on the forecastle, one on a platform between the funnels, and one aft. The destroyer mounted a single 2-pounder 40 mm (1.6 in) \"pom-pom\" anti-aircraft gun for air defence. Four 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes were carried in two twin rotating mounts aft. Four depth charge chutes were also fitted aft. Initially, typically ten depth charges were carried. The ship was designed to mount two additional 18 in (457 mm) torpedo tubes either side of the superstructure but this required the forecastle plating to be cut away, causing excess water to come aboard at sea, so they were not carried. The weight saved enabled the heavier Mark V 21-inch torpedo to be carried. Fire control included a training-only director, single Dumaresq and a Vickers range clock.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\nLaid down by Palmers at their dockyard in Jarrow, Stonehenge, the first Royal Navy ship to be given the name, was launched on 19 March 1919 after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the war. The vessel was commissioned on 14 August 1919, joining the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla as a tender to the depot ship Hecla. The ship was transferred to Chatham to replace the R-class destroyer Tempest and was completed to full crew on 11 October. The vessel briefly served in the British campaign in the Baltic as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, but returned to Chatham on 1 April 1920.\nOn 20 August 1920, the Treaty of Sèvres was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies agreeing the partition of the Ottoman Empire. However, to enforce the terms required military intervention in the region. The Royal Navy had been in military occupation of Constantinople since 16 March. Stonehenge was detached from the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla and joined the deployment, serving in the Mediterranean Sea. On 31 October, the destroyer sailed from Constantinople to Mudros on a routine mission, to collect mail and ratings. However, off the coast of Smyrna, the vessel encountered very strong rain that reduced visibility and ran aground. The crew fired rockets to attract attention and were rescued by sister ship Serapis, which also attempted to refloat the destroyer. This was unsuccessful and Stonehenge was abandoned on 6 November. The wreck was sold on 26 March 1921.\n\n\n== Pennant numbers ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Patricia L. \"Trish\" Beckman is an American retired naval pilot, one of only five since World War II to be selected as a Naval Flight Officer.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPatricia L. \"Trish\" Beckman was born in Huntsville, Alabama, to William and Betty Beckman, and was the oldest of seven children; Beckman's father was a Korean War veteran in the Army. She was raised in Alabama until she graduated from Lee High School in 1970. Her early interest in aviation was partially because the Saturn V rocket was partly built in Huntsville during the space race with the Soviet Union. After graduating high school, Beckman enlisted in the United States Navy.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== Early enlistment ===\nBeckman enlisted in the US Navy in 1970 during the Vietnam War era. During her first eight years of enlistment, she maintained and operated flight simulators and gained higher education while serving under the Naval Enlisted Scientific Education Program. She earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from 1974 to 1978 at North Carolina State University and a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1988 from the Naval Postgraduate School. She was involved in NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) from 1978 to 1981 as a fleet support and liaison officer in Dahlgren, Virginia.\n\n\n=== Pilot ===\nIn 1980, Beckman became one of only five women since World War II to be selected as a Naval Flight Officer, and in 1982 earned her wings as a pilot. She is a part of the first batch of women to graduate from the US Naval Test Pilot School and later became an instructor at the academy. She is the first-ever American woman to qualify to crew the F-15E and its variants and the first to qualify to crew the F/A-18 and its variants. In her military career, Beckman piloted 67 different types of aircraft and in 1999  retired as a commander, serving 28 years.\nHer service in the Navy during the Vietnam War and the complex public perceptions of veterans who served during that period of US history have stuck with Beckman during her career and retirement. Beckman believes that veterans are treated with more respect now than some of her fellow veterans received when returning from the war.\nIn 1991, Beckman participated in an effort to lobby the US Congress in favor of repealing exclusionary laws that prevented women from partaking in combat roles in the military. She is credited as being a part of that successful effort.\n\n\n== Time at Boeing ==\nAfter she retired from the Navy in 1999, Beckman continued her education by earning a second master's degree in business administration at Webster University in 2002. That same year she became certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as a flight navigator and aircraft dispatcher.\nBeckman was then employed by Boeing as a test pilot for their civilian aircraft program and flew as a Systems Operator for production and engineering test flights for the Boeing 737. She also functioned as a Flight Test Navigator for ferry flights and engineered test flights for most Boeing aircraft (737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787), clocking in over 6000 hours of flight time for 73 different types of aircraft.\nIn 2013 she became a contributor to support Boeing Test & Evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base for military aircraft.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nBeckman has contributed to and founded various organizations whose mission is to celebrate, educate, and empower women in the aviation industry. She was the president of Women Military Aviators Inc. (WMA), a founding board member of Women in Aviation International (WAI), and inducted into the Pioneer Hall of Fame in 2010.\nBeckman now resides in Seattle, Washington. She uses her life story to inspire and motivate young people to pursue a career in STEM and aviation. Trish is a workshop presenter for the Sally Ride Science Festivals in various places around the US and a contributor to several aerospace museums.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "József Tóbiás (Serbian Cyrillic: Јожеф Тобиаш, romanized: Jožef Tobiaš; born 31 August 1971) is a Serbian politician from the country's Hungarian community. He served in the Assembly of Vojvodina from 2008 to 2016, has been the president (i.e., speaker) of the Ada municipal assembly since 2020, and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024. Previously with the Democratic Party (DS), Tóbiás has been a member of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMSZ) since 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and private career ==\nTóbiás was born in Senta, in what was then the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He is an entrepreneur, working in a business that has been overseen by his family for three generations. He received a certificate in handball coaching in 2011 and has received awards from the Vojvodina Handball Association and the Hungarian Handball Association.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Democratic Party ===\nTóbiás was elected to the Vojvodina assembly in the 2008 provincial election, winning the Ada constituency seat in the second round of voting. The Democratic Party and its allies won a majority government, and he served as a supporter of the provincial administration. He was re-elected in the 2012 provincial election, in which the DS and its allies fell narrowly below a majority and afterward formed a coalition government with other parties. In his second term, he was a member of agriculture committee and the committee for national equality. He was not a candidate in the 2016 provincial election.\nTóbiás also appeared in the second position on the DS's electoral list for Ada in the 2008 Serbian local elections and was given a mandate when the party won a plurality victory with ten out of twenty-nine seats. Zoltán Bilicki of the Democratic Party served afterward as mayor in a coalition administration. Tóbiás later received the fourth position on the DS list in the 2012 local elections and was re-elected when the list won a majority victory with sixteen mandates. Bilicki continued to serve as mayor.\nIn early 2016, Bilicki left the Democratic Party and founded his own citizens' group in Ada, which won a majority victory in that year's local elections. Tóbiás did not seek re-election to the assembly but was appointed to the municipal council (i.e., the executive branch of the local government) when Bilicki's third administration was established in June 2016.\nBilicki joined the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) in late 2016. Tóbiás did not follow him but instead joined the VMSZ two years later.\n\n\n=== Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians ===\nTóbiás joined the VMSZ in 2018 and became president of its municipal board in Ada. He continued serving on the municipal council for the next two years. \nIn the 2020 local elections, Tóbiás led the VMSZ's list in Ada and was re-elected to the local assembly when the list won eleven seats. Bilicki was confirmed for another term as mayor after the election, and Tóbiás was chosen as president of the assembly. He continues to serve in this role as of 2024.\nHe also appeared in the 189th position on the VMSZ's electoral list in the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election. Election from this position was not a realistic prospect, and he was not elected when the list won nine seats. \nIn the 2023 parliamentary election, Tóbiás was given the fourth position on the VMSZ's list and was elected when the list won six seats. He took his seat when the assembly convened in February 2024. He is now the deputy chair of the agriculture committee and a deputy member of the finance committee and the committee on human and minority rights and general equality.\nTóbiás was elected as chair of the VMSZ's council in March 2024. He is now leading the VMSZ's list for Ada in the 2024 Serbian local elections.\n\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n\n=== Provincial (Vojvodina) ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "etf.com is an American financial news and media company that covers exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Since February 2021 the company is owned by ETFS Capital.  \nThe company is headquartered in New York City. The current CEO is Michael Morelli.\n\n\n== History ==\netf.com was founded in 2001 as IndexUniverse.com by Jim Wiandt as a subsidiary of his company IndexUniverse, LLC. Prior to founding IndexUniverse.com, Wiandt was the publisher of IndexFunds.com and authored the book Exchange Traded Funds (2001). The company was founded in collaboration with Steven Schoenfeld who provided the IndexUniverse.com URL.  \nIn 2001, Wiandt acquired the Journal of Indexes from Dow Jones & Company. In 2003, he acquired the print newspaper Exchange Traded Report. These publications merged into IndexUniverse.com. The company initially focused on index investing before shifting to solely providing data and content on ETFs. \nWiandt also started the industry events business Inside ETFs. In 2014, the Inside ETFs conference had 1,600 attendees.  \nIn 2010, the company developed a database of all ETFs registered in the United States. The database was available online for free.  \nIn 2014, IndexUniverse.com changed its name to ETF.com.  \nIn 2015, Wiandt stepped down as CEO of ETF.com. Its data business was sold to financial data company FactSet. Inside ETFs was sold to the British financial publishing and events company Informa, which continues to hold the conference annually.  \nIn 2016, etf.com's publication business was sold to Cboe Global Markets. In 2021, the United Kingdom-based venture capital firm ETFS Capital acquired ETF.com. ETFS Capital was founded by Australian businessman Graham Tuckwell. Michael Morelli was named CEO in January 2022.  \nIn April 2023, the company was rebranded as etf.com and re-launched their website.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The American Cash Apartments/American Cash Store located in Sacramento, California is a historic apartment building designed in the Commercial Style architecture style, located two blocks northwest of the California State Capitol building. Designed by George C. Sellon, the first state architect of California who designed many notable buildings during the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter its completion, the  second and third floors had a total of twenty-four apartments. Orlando F. Washburn had hired Sellon to design the building that would house his retail operation, American Cash Store, which had outgrown its original location at the corner of Eighth and K Streets. After moving into the new location, The American Cash Store had 67 employees and 17 delivery wagons, and its departments included grocery, delicatessen, bakery, and hardware. The business suffered an interior fire in the early morning hours of November 7, 1909, not long after the building was completed, and the American Cash Store had to temporarily relocate. The fire started in the basement, and caused $65,000 worth of damage. The building was quickly repaired and opened back in February 1910. The American Cash Apartments appealed to middle class renters and some legislators kept apartments in the building, including Secretary of the Senate Walter N. Parrish of Stockton and Senator Henry H. Lyon in 1911, and William J. Ferguson of San Francisco in 1921.\nIn the 1920s, the American Cash Store was affiliated with a meat dealers’ union that actively worked to suppress Asian-owned markets and fuel anti-Japanese sentiment, and advertised itself as a butcher shop run by American citizens, despite its proximity to Sacramento's West End Japantown. The American Cash Store had closed by the end of the 1920s and subsequent stores include a butcher shop ran by W.J. Atkinson, a grocery store ran by H. King, and Muzio French & Italian Bakery occupied the third storefront. During the 1930s a hat cleaner and a business called “Sanitarium System of Baths” moved into the building. The corner at 1117 8th St. had housed restaurants and bars since the early 1930s, starting with a Chinese American restaurant called Dragon Café. Subsequently, the corner unit was home to a sandwich shop and bar called Prosperity Corner, which featured live music and strip-tease acts.\nIn 1937, the building's name was changed to the Bel-Vue Apartments. Around this time, the Spillman-Callister Real Estate Company acquired the building and perhaps changed the name to signal new ownership.  The Spillman-Callister Company invested in upgrades, such as Steam heat and refrigeration and advertised them heavily.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Prehistoric Stimpy is the sixth episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 5 November 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy visit the Museum of Natural History where Wilbur Cobb is the guide who gives a confused, rambling and mostly inaccurate account of prehistoric life. Cobb states that life on earth  began as single-celled amoebas and the story goes back in time hundreds of millions of years into the distant past where amoebas lived in the sea. One amoeba that resembles Stimpy annoys an amoeba that resembles Ren, causing the Ren amoeba to slap the Stimpy amoeba, which then divides into new amoebas. In the present, Cobb then moves forward in time to the age of the Stimpyfish, which crawled out of the ocean onto land, only to fall into a tar pit while another Stimpyfish crawls out of the ocean to avoid the tar pit and instead is run over by a bus. Ren dismisses this story until Cobb shows him a prehistoric bus. Cobb then moves forward in time to speak of the Stimpysaurus, the \"stupidest creature of all time\", a dinosaur that resembles Stimpy which he is shown to be of very low intelligence as it slapped around by a dinosaur that resembles Ren. In the present, Stimpy asks Cobb how the dinosaurs went extinct and receives baffling bizarre answers in response such as the dinosaurs went extinct because they watched too much television. Cobb is arrested as he is revealed not to be a museum guide and as he is carried away shouts \"I killed the dinosaurs!\".  Ren and Stimpy prove their low intelligence by walking into a tar pit that is part of an exhibit and both drown.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nWilbur Cobb-voice of Jack Carter\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was illustrated by the Mr. Big Cartoons studio of Sydney. The cartoon was largely created by the showrunner, Bob Camp, who felt sorry for the financially distressed actor Jack Carter, and Prehistoric Stimpy was intended to be a showcase of Carter's vocal talents that would also give him some needed money. The scene where Stimpy rips off pieces of Cobb's face was censored by the network.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski wrote that the episode was one of the stronger episodes that featured the recurring Wilbur Cobb character.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Tsar Mangal (Russian: Царь-мангал, also  Turtle Tank) is a Russian T-72 tank supplied with an extra steel roof and siding, as well as anti-drone grills. For the first time tit was spotted in early April on the battlefield of the Russo-Ukraine War. They also have anti-drone radio jamming equipment. The Russian name derived from the Russian slang \"mangal\" for anti-drone grills, in an analogy with  Tsar Cannon and Tsar Bomb. Newer models are equipped with  mine-clearing rollers KMT 7 with electromagnetic mine detector/trawl Электромагнитный тральщик /приставка ЭМТ.  \nIts major drawbacks are poor visibility and mobility, as well as non-rotating turret. However it serves well as a demining vehicle during armored assaults. These contraptions only work well against drones, but Ukrainian troops are lacking artillery and anti-tank missiles, so they are doing their job so far.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1979 the league changed its name to West Wimmera Football League. \n\n\n=== Central Wimmera 1922-1968 ===\nThis competition started in 1922 with teams from Horsham Seconds, Jung, Natimuk, Quantong and Toolondo. \nPrior to the merger the Central Wimmera consisted of Balmoral, Douglas-Miga Lake, Goroke, Horsham Football Club Seconds, Natimuk and Noradjuha. A majority of these teams were based west of Horsham, Victoria. Pimpino had joined the Horsham & District Football League the previous year and Peronne folded in 1967.\n\n\n=== Lowan Star 1923-1968 ===\nThe Lowan Star Association was based around settlements close to Nhill. This competition started in 1923 between teams from Kinimakatka, Propodallah and Winiam Imperials.  The final teams were, Cannum, Dimboola Seconds, Gerang-Kiata, Jeparit Seconds, Netherby-Lorquon, Nhill Seconds, Warracknabeal Seconds and Winiam. All of the standalone teams joined the merged league apart from Cannum which joined the Horsham & District until they folded in 1971.\nThe seconds sides were required to move into the Wimmera Football League second XVIII competition, which was the major league of the district, this provoked the change for a merged league.\nThe league was renamed the West Wimmera Football League in 1979 which would last for three seasons until the league finished at the end of 1981.\n\n\n== Clubs ==\n\n\n=== Final Clubs in 1981 ===\n\n\n=== Previous Clubs ===\n\n\n== 1979 Ladder ==\n\n\n== 1980 Ladder ==\n\n\n== 1981 Ladder ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "UGC 9684 is a barred spiral galaxy with a ring structure in the Boötes constellation. It is located 250 million light-years from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 90,000 light-years.\nThe luminosity class of UGC 9684 is I-II and it is classified as an activestar-forming galaxy according to a study published in 2022, in which produces one solar mass of stars every few years, with levels of stellar formation.\n\n\n== Studying of star formation rate for UGC 9684 ==\nScientists who studied UGC 9684, have longed to find out the star-formation rate for UGC 9684. To do this, they used a Fitting and Assessment of Synthetic Templates code. The scientists used further observations via ultraviolet, both optical and near-infrared and from the luminosity measurements from different databases from GALEX, SDSS and from the final release of the MASS extended source catalog by Jarrett et al. 2000, with all the data retrieved from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.  \nAs for the star formation, they employed a decreasing function of (SFR ∝ e−t ) and also a delayed function (SFR ∝ t × e−t ) as well as the stellar population libraries written from Bruzual & Charlot and Convoy et al. Several metallicity estimates, published by Prieto et al. 2008, Kelly & Kirshner from 2012, whom the majority agreed, it is slightly above solar oxygen abundance 12+ log(O/H) ≈ 9.0 which corresponds to ~2 Z⊙. \nScientists therefore found that the star-formation rate of UGC 9684 is 0.25–0.39 M⊙ yr−1. Apart from that, they found the total stellar mass for the galaxy is M⋆ = (2.0–3.5) × 1010 M⊙ which is a current specific of SFR sSFR ≈ 0.01 Gyr−1. This is higher compared to literature but compatible to large number of recent events in UGC 9684.  \n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nFour supernovae; SN 2006ed, SN 2012ib, AT 2017cgh and SN 2020pni, have been discovered in UGC 9684. This makes it as one of the most active supernova-producing galaxies. \nSN 2006ed\nSN 2006ed was discovered on September 18, 2006, via unfiltered CCD images, by N. Joubert, D. R. Madison, R. Mostardi, H. Khandrika and W. Li from University of California, Berkeley on behalf of Lick Observatory Supernova Search program (LOSS). SN 2006ed had a magnitude on 19.0.  It was located 1\".8 east and 7\".2 south of the nucleus. This supernova was Type II.\nSN 2012ib\nSN 2012ib was discovered on December 20, 2012, by amateur astronomer, V. Shumkov from Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI), on four 60-sec unfiltered images from the MASTER-Amur robotic telescope via a 0.40-m f/2.5 reflector. The supernova was located at 48\".7 east and 0\".4 south of the nucleus, which it had a magnitude of 18.9. The supernova was Type Ib/c. \nAT 2017cgh \nAT 2017cgh was discovered on March 15, 2017, by Pan-STARRS1 Science consortium. It was located 0\".0 east and 0\".0 north of the nucleus with a magnitude of 17.7.  This supernova had an unknown type.\nSN 2020pni\nSN 2020pni was discovered on July 16, 2020, by a team of astronomers on behalf of the ALeRCE broker via r-ZTF filters which was taken by a Palomar 1.2m Oachin telescope. It was located 5\".7 west and 5\".0 south of the nucleus with a magnitude of 17.0. The supernova was Type II in which its progenitor, a massive star, was enriched in helium and nitrogen in relative abundances in mass fractions of 0.30–0.40 and 8.2 × 10−3, respectively.\nA first study shows 1 day after the discovery, there is a significant He II emission which has strong flash features.  Another study shows during the 4 days after, there was an increase in velocity of hydrogen lines (from ∼250 to ∼1000 km s−1) suggesting complex circumstellar medium  (CSM).  A presence of dense and confined CSM as well as its inhomogeneous structure, indicates a phrase of enhanced mass loss of the SN 2020pni progenitor a year before the explosion. As of 2023, the supernova has since faded from view.\n\n\n== References ==",

Barkett plays Richard, an ex-police officer who seeks to avenge the apparent death of his former lover (Tera Hendrickson), whom he witnessed be ritually sacrificed two decades prior by Satan worshipper Arkham (Richard Harrison) after entering a portal to Hell.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSteve Barkett as Richard Flynn\nChristopher Barkett as Terry Nash\nTera Hendrickson as Angela Nash\nRichard Harrison as Arkham\nDawn Wildsmith as Madame Oleska\nJay Richardson as Eddie Green\nPatricia Schiotis as Stacey Brent\nJoseph Pilato as Guy Zupan\nAnimator Jim Danforth appears as one of Satan's henchmen.\n\n\n== Production ==\nEmpire of the Dark was shot on 35 mm film.\nBarkett described the film to Tulsa World:\n\nIt's really very much a Sleeping Beauty story, combined with Bela Lugosi's White Zombie and a lot of other stuff. It's the toughest movie, and the most expensive movie, I've ever made, and it's been a tough sell.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film was released on VHS by the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based distributor VCI Home Video in 1997; VCI later re-released the film on DVD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nZiemba, Joseph A.; Budnik, Dan (2013).

It is so difficult to discover anything new on which to build up a plot now-a-days, that the collaborateurs deserve honest praise for the'way\nin which they have woven their story about the much-discussed subjeot of hypnotism.\"\nThe Argues said the play needed \" a less complicated and more coherent plot, some infusion of humour, a more interesting dialogue, and more natural incident.\"\nThe Lorgnette said \"it is a strong play, although somewhat complicated, and at times incoherent in plot\" but stating \"it is a cleverly constructed and well-written drama, and at any rate may be taken as a. courageous venture on- the part of the authors.\"\nThe play was not as successful as other Dampier melodramas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFor Love and Life at AustLit",

It was located in the Fonte d'Amore area near the hermitage of Sant'Onofrio al Morrone and the terraces of the temple of Hercules Curinus in the foothills of the Mount Morrone near contemporary Sulmona (AQ), in Abruzzo, Italy.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe medieval village of Sagizzano was probably founded around the 10th century in the territory controlled by the city of Sulmona, contemporary to Sulmona in Abruzzo. Mentioned in the Catalogus Baronum, the fortified village of Sagizzano was characterized by the presence of several rural churches. The toponym appears with different spellings in historical and ecclesiastical documents such as the papal bulls of Pope Lucius III and Pope Clement III. Historians have attested to the hermitic presence of Pietro Angelerio, the future Pope Celestine V, in the small church of Santa Maria di Segezzano near the caves of the same name around the year 1240.\nDuring the 13th century, the universitas of Seghezzano, already in decline, was incorporated into the government of Sulmona.\nThe village suffered the effects of various seismic events and the devastation of a flood, which likely caused the definitive abandonment of the site by the population during the 14th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMorrone Mountains\nHermitage of Sant'Onofrio al Morrone\nBadia Morronese\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tat alphabet is used for writing in the Tat language, which has two main dialects - the northern one, spoken by Mountain Jews, and the southern one,\nspoken by the Tats. During its existence, the Tat writing functioned primarily in the northern dialect and at the same time changed its graphic basis several times and was reformed several times. Currently, the writing of the Mountain Jews is in Cyrillic alphabets, and the writing of the Muslim Tats is in the Latin alphabet.\nThere are four stages in the history of Tat writing:\n\n1870s - 1928 - writing based on Hebrew alphabet.\n1928-1938 - writing based on the Latin alphabet.\nSince 1938 - writing based on the Cyrillic alphabet.\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, there have been attempts to create a written language on a Latin basis in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Hebrew alphabet ==\n.\nThe first records of Judeo-Tat writing date back to the late 1870s and early 1880s, when Rabbi\nYaakov Yitzhaki compiled the first Tat book, “Thesaurus of Judeo-Tat (Juhuri) language of the\nMountain Jews of the Caucasus.” This book used Hebrew writing, adapted to the needs of Tat phonetics. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Tat script on a Jewish graphic basis became more widely used - books began to be published in it, and in 1915 an attempt was made to publish a newspaper. In 1921, the first primer New School (Judeo-Tat: Таза школа) was published in this alphabet. In 1927, at the All-Union Conference on cultural work among the Mountain Jews, held in Moscow, it was decided to reflect in writing all the vowel sounds of the Judeo-Tat dialect (א [æ], אַ [a], אָ [о], י [i], ו [v], וּ [u]). However, at that time the process of transitioning the Tat language to the Latin script was beginning, which made the reform irrelevant.\nThe Judeo-Tat alphabet based on the Hebrew script looked like this:\n\n\n== Soviet Latin alphabet ==\nIn the 1920s, the process of romanization of scripts was underway in the USSR. In May 1925, Y. Agarunov compiled the first draft of a Latinized alphabet for Mountain Jews. On May 15–20, 1926, at the regional congress of Mountain Jews in Nalchik, it was decided to transfer the Tat writing system to a Latin graphic basis. Since that time, preparatory work on Latinization began in the North Caucasus and Azerbaijan. In 1928, several projects for a new script were submitted to the committee for a new alphabet for consideration. Thus, the project of Z. Yu. Khudainatov included the following letters: А a, B в, V v, G g, D d, H h, Z z, Ӡ ӡ, ħ, I i, J j, K k, X x, L ʟ, M m, N n, S s, Y y, P p, F f, C c, Ç ç, ꜧ, R r, Ş ş, T t, O o, U u, Ú ú, E e.\nOn April 28–30, 1929, the All-Union Conference of representatives of the Mountain Jewish people were held in Baku. It finally approved the new alphabet for the Judeo-Tat language proposed by Boris Miller. It looked like this:\n\nThis alphabet was actively used in the field of education, book publishing and the media. In\n1932, the first standard grammar of the Tat language was published.\nIn later editions in Latin, the letter Đ đ is absent, but is present (only in borrowings) E e\n\n\n== Cyrillic alphabets ==\nThe question of the transition of the Judeo-Tat language to the Cyrillic alphabet was raised in 1937. The Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic instructed the Institute for the Study of National Cultures of Dagestan to develop this version of the letter. A new version of the alphabet was published on February 15, 1938, in the newspaper Dagestankaya Pravda; on July 1, all periodicals were translated into it, and on September 1, teaching the Cyrillic alphabet began in schools. Later, some changes were made to the alphabet (the letter Дж дж was excluded. The letter УӀ уӀ was replaced by Уь уь, and ХӀ хӀ by Хь хь). As a result, the alphabet began to look like this:\n\nIn the Azerbaijan SSR in 1938, the Judeo-Tat language was removed from all official spheres of activity - the publication of books, newspapers, and teaching in schools was stopped.\nTherefore, the alphabet adopted in the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was not used in Azerbaijan. However, instead of it, a separate version of the Tat Cyrillic writing spontaneously arose, which was closer to the Cyrillic version of the Azerbaijani alphabet. At the\nend of the 20th - beginning of the 21st century, it also found some use among the Mountain Jewish who emigrated to Israel А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Д д, Е е, Ҹ ҹ, З з, И и, Й й, К к, Ҝ ҝ, Л л, М м, Н н, О о, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, Һ һ, Ћ ћ, Ԧ ԧ, У у, Ф ф, Х х, Ч ч, Ш ш, Ә ә, Ү ү. There are other versions of this alphabet, differing in the order of the letters and the replacement of the letter И й with Ј ј, as well as the presence of additional letters ӱ, ы.\n\n\n== Modern Latin alphabet in Azerbaijan ==\nIn the 1990s, an alphabet based on Latin was created for the Muslim Tats of Azerbaijan. Several\ntextbooks have been published on it: A a, B b, C c, Ç ç, D d, E e, Ә ə, F f, G g, Ğ ğ, H h, X x, I ı, İ i, J j, K k, Q q, L l, M m, N n, O o, Ö ö, P p, R r, S s, Ş ş, T t, U u, Ü ü, V v, Y y, Z z.\nSeveral scientific publications and dictionaries of the Judeo-Tat language of Azerbaijan sometimes use another version of the Latin alphabet: A a, B b, C c, Ç ç, D d, E e, Ә ə, F f, G g, Q q, H h,  ħ, Ⱨ ⱨ, İ i, I ı, J j, K k, L l, M m, N n, O o, P p, R r, S s, Ş ş, T t, U u, Ü ü, V v, Y y, X x, Z z.\n\n\n== Alphabets correspondence table ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Hind's Hall\" is a protest song by American rapper Macklemore, released as a single on May 6, 2024. It expresses support for the pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses that call for divestment from Israel and a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.\nThe song's title is a reference to pro-Palestinian activists' renaming of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University to \"Hind's Hall\" in honor of Hind Rajab, a Palestinian child killed by Israeli forces. In the song, Macklemore is critical of US funding of Israel; he describes Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories as apartheid. Additionally, Macklemore announces his opposition to the music industry for their silence on the issue, and to President Joe Biden because of Biden's support for the Israeli government and military. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the Israel–Hamas war, pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses have taken place across the world, particularly in the United States, as activists call for their universities to divest from Israel. Protestor encampments have been raided by US police, who arrested more than 2,300 students, many of whom face expulsion and campus bans.\nProtests at Columbia University have been prominent. At Columbia, activists occupied Hamilton Hall and renamed the building as \"Hind's Hall\" in honor of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza City along with her relatives and paramedics who came to her rescue. On April 30, 2024, New York police sieged Hamilton Hall and arrested the protestors inside.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\"Hind's Hall\" was composed and produced by Macklemore, and samples \"Ana La Habibi\" by Lebanese singer Fairuz. In his lyrics, Macklemore is critical of the United States' funding of Israel, whose occupation of Palestinian territories he describes as apartheid. He also criticizes acceptance by US politicians of financial resources from pro-Israel lobbying organizations such as Christians United for Israel (CUFI) and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). \"Hind's Hall\" also makes references to genocide, the Nakba, and the killing of Palestinian men, women, and children in the Gaza Strip.\nMacklemore calls for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war. He condemns the music industry's \"platform of silence\" on the war. He also references the ongoing feud between rappers Drake and Kendrick Lamar, saying he considers it a minor issue compared to the war. Additionally, Macklemore declares President Joe Biden to be complicit in the Israeli government's mass murder of Palestinian civilians, saying \"The blood is on your hands, Biden\". Macklemore proclaims that he will not be voting for Biden in the 2024 United States presidential election, and that he is undecided.\nThe song also denounces Congress' banning of TikTok, the white supremacy apparent in policing and policy decisions, and the conflation of antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Macklemore quotes the title of the 1988 song \"Fuck tha Police\" by hip hop group N.W.A.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe single was released on social media on May 6, 2024. Macklemore announced that once the song was available on streaming services, all proceeds would be donated to UNRWA. Macklemore performed the song live for the first time on May 9, 2024 in New Zealand, saying, \"I stand here today and every day forward for the rest of my life in solidarity with the people of Palestine, with an open heart, in the belief that our collective liberation is at stake – that we all deserve freedom in this life of ours\". The song was released to streaming platforms on May 10, 2024.\nThe song's music video includes a photo of a college building spray-painted with the phrase \"Free Palastine [sic]\". Some internet users erroneously believed the photo was taken at Columbia University and used it to criticize the protesters. The photo was taken of Tabaret Hall at the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSolcyre Burga in Time called it \"the latest addition to the catalog of American protest songs that includes Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" and Crosby, Stills, and Nash & Young's  [sic] \"Ohio.\" Guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine tweeted: \"Honestly @macklemore’s 'Hind’s Hall' is the most Rage Against The Machine song since Rage Against The Machine.\" Jill Stein, the Green Party's presidential candidate in 2024, publicly thanked Macklemore for making the song. Reception from social media has been positive, with many users praising Macklemore's use of his platform to protest. Aja Romano of Vox called the song \"electrifying\" due to its surprise release. They noted that Macklemore's position as a white independent artist has helped him to express himself freely without career-ending consequences, especially considering the song's contentious subject matter.\nThe music video has been widely shared on Twitter and Instagram, gaining millions of views, but on YouTube it has been age-restricted. The video sharing website has been accused by social media users of censorship and limiting the song's outreach. However, on May 11, it was reported that it was available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube.\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of anti-war songs\nFDT (song), anti–Donald Trump protest song with remix featuring Macklemore\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial video on YouTube\nVIDEO: Hind's Hall by Macklemore, The Independent (May 2024)\nOfficial video on Twitter",

He was a general historian, editor of the works of the Carmelite saints, and superior general of the order. One of his greatest contributions to Carmelite studies was an annotated edition of the works of Teresa of Ávila and John of the Cross.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFr.

        "content": "Lecanora perpruinosa is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Lecanoraceae. It occurs in Northern Europe, Estonia, Turkey, Russia, and Canada, where it grows on calcareous rocks.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was first scientifically described by Lars Fröberg in his 1989 PhD dissertation. The type specimen was collected from a pavement in Sweden. However, the species is not considered to be validly published according to nomenclatural rules: although all of the requirements for valid publication were met by the author, he explicitly stated in his work that the new species was \"not formally described here\". In 2015, Śliwa, Zhao Xin, and Lumbsch proposed to transfer the taxon to the genus Myriolecis. This new combination is also not valid because the basionym upon which it is based is invalid. Despite the nomenclatural invalidity of the taxon, it continues to be referenced in lichenological literature.\nIn a molecular phylogenetics analysis, Lecanora perpruinosa was shown to occupy a sister group relationship with a clade of species referred to as the Lecanora dispersa group.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Lecanora perpruinosa is superficial, presenting an ash-grey colour. It is thin and displays either a cracked (rimose) or tiled (areolate) pattern, with an indistinct but mostly continuous edge. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) measure 0.3–0.8 mm in diameter. These structures are sessile, meaning they sit directly on the substrate without a stalk. The disc of the apothecia can appear black or near-black, or dark red to brown, and is heavily dusted with a bluish-white powdery coating called pruina. The edges of the apothecia are pronounced or level with the disc and share the same pruinose, colour-matching appearance as the thallus.\nThe cortex surrounding the apothecia is distinctly paraplechtenchymatous, indicating it is made up of densely interwoven hyphae, providing structural integrity. Unlike some other species in the genus, there are no granules in the epithecium (the uppermost layer of cells in the apothecia). The paraphyses (filamentous structures among the spores) are simple, thick, and bead-like (submoniliform). The ascospores of Lecanora perpruinosa are medium-sized, measuring between 10.5 and 12.0 μm in length and 5.0–7.5 μm in width. This lichen does not produce any secondary metabolites typically found in other lichens.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nIn addition to Sweden, the country of its original determination, its distribution in Northern Europe also includes Finland, Norway, and Denmark. It also occurs in Estonia, and Turkey. In Russia, it has been recorded from the Ryazan Oblast, the Komi Republic, and the Tver Oblast. In 2000, the lichen was reported growing on limestone cliffs within the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve in southern Ontario, Canada, marking its first record from North America.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Lecanora species\n\n\n== References ==",

A signatory to the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, he served as a member of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born 1942. His biological parents died during World War II and he was subsequently adopted by his maternal uncle Francisco Sablan Pangelinan. He attended school in Guam, including College of Guam. In the 1960s, Pangelinan joined the Popular Party owing to his belief in reintegrating Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.\nHe returned to Saipan and became an elementary school teacher before joining the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands as an accountant. He later joined the staff of the Peace Corps. He was later elected to the Saipan Municipal Council. He was appointed one of the members of the Marianas Political Status Commission. After the receipt of Commonwealth status, the CNMI held its first election. Carlos S. Camacho was elected governor and appointed Pangelinan, a supporter, as an advisor with the title Special Assistant for Administration and Finance. In the 1979 election, Pangelinan was elected to the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives from the 6th district, which included Tanapag and San Roque. He was elected alongside Egredino \"Dino\" Mendiola Jones. He was the Speaker of the House during the 2nd Commonwealth Legislature.\nPangelinan was the chairman of the Democratic Party for a period of time in the 1980s. After the Democratic Party was supplanted by the Covenant Party as one of the Northern Mariana Islands’ two major parties, Pangelinan continued to support the Democratic Party as an organization and a number of Democratic and independent candidates for public office until his death. He died June 28, 2013.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Where That Came From\" is a song by American country music singer Randy Travis. It was released on May 3, 2024, and served as Travis' first new recording of music in over a decade, developed through the use of artificial intelligence software to recreate his vocals following a series of strokes and health issues that left him unable to sing.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn July 2013, Travis experienced difficulty breathing while working out at his home gym. He was hospitalized in Dallas, Texas for viral cardiomyopathy. While undergoing treatment, Travis suffered congestive heart failure and a stroke. The stroke affected the left side of Travis's brain, impacting movement on the right side of his body. Travis was placed on life support after the infection caused his lungs to collapse, and was declared to have a one percent chance of survival. The infection, subsequent stroke, and three separate bouts of pneumonia led to Travis undergoing three tracheostomies and two brain surgeries. Travis also suffered aphasia and lost the ability to speak and sing, while also suffering vision problems. These issues were mitigated through years of therapy with Davis, to whom he was engaged at the time. By November 2014, he was recovering, could walk short distances without assistance, and was re-learning to write and play guitar, according to Davis. While the stroke removed most of Travis's ability to sing, he has made sporadic onstage appearances to perform in limited capacity.\nIn 2023, the increased use of artificial intelligence spurred conversation about the need to protect artists' rights. However, Cris Lacy, Warner Music Nashville co-chair and co-president, believed that some positive influence could come from it in the way of \"giving Randy Travis his voice back\". \"Where That Came From\" is a ballad written by Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill, and Travis' longtime producer Kyle Lehning developed the vocal track from an initial recording done by vocalist and frequent touring partner James Dupré, working for months on perfecting it from the AI model's base rendering. They worked from two proprietary AI models that utilized vocal stems from Travis' career spanning from 1985 to 2013.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSurrounded by friends and family, Travis reacted with a \"Cheshire grin\" when the finished product was played in the studio for the first time, and Travis' wife, Mary, was moved to tears, saying \"you forget how much you missed it until you hear it again\". Fellow country music artists and friends of Travis such as Carrie Underwood, Cole Swindell, and Clay Walker were among those invited to the studio to preview the song ahead of its release and reacted to it with \"a mix of joy and wonder\". \n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Where That Came From\" premiered on May 6, 2024. It is composed of footage from the recording studio, documenting scenes from the process of the song's creation and of the reactions by Travis as well as his family and friends listening to the track for the first time.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Where That Came From\" debuted at number 45 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated May 18, 2024, becoming Travis' first solo single to chart since \"Angels\" reached a peak of number 48 in 2005.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mabel Burnside Myers (1922–1987) was a Diné weaver, herbalist and sheepherder. She is known for being the first Indigenous weaver to create dye charts for teaching students.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBurnside Myers was born in 1922 in Pine Springs, Arizona into a family of weavers and silversmiths. She attended high school, graduating in 1938. At the Fort Wingate Vocational High School, she began to create a natural, plant-based dye book. She went on to become the head of the department of weaving at the Shiprock Vocational School, before reaching her 30th birthday.\nBurnside Myers had five children; she taught all of them about identifying plants to make dyes. Her daughter, Isabel Deschinny, is a well-known textile artist.\n\n\n== Work ==\nBurnside Myers is known for creating complex work, such as two-faced blankets with a different design on each side. She would raise her own sheep, would forage for over 300 different plants to use for making dyes, card the wool and spin the yarn, dye the yarn, then set up the loom and weave.\nLike other Navajo weavers, she kept the complex patterns for her weavings in her memory, rather than referring to a written or drawn pattern.\nHer work has been exhibited nationally, and has been in exhibitions at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, and at the Arts & Crafts Guild, at Window Rock, Arizona. \n\nBurnside Myers used vegetable dye materials in her work,  and is considered the first Indigenous weaver to invent dye charts from plant matter as guides to teach others about sources of dyes for use in weaving. Later, her dye charts were produced to sell on the tourist market. Each of her dye charts included a miniature woven textile on a miniature vertical frame loom, surrounded by pressed botanical specimens of plants, with each specimen identified with the name of the plant. Pieces of dyed yarn served as \"pointers\" to the various colors in the miniature weaving. The dye charts served as an \"index of place...an atlas–a mental map–of Navajo weaving worlds\" that provided a critical \"material record of indigenous ways of knowing the landscape and its natural colorants.\" Burnside Myers would travel extensively to exhibit her work teach others about weaving with plant-based dyes.\nBurnside Myers and her family were featured in the 1958 documentary film, The Navajo (Part 1):\"The Search for America\", directed by Dick Hatzel. In the film she presented an award-winning rug made with yarn dyed with 85 different plant-based colors. She has also been the subject of a film by Frank Cummings and Eileen Green. Burnside Myers and Green, an anthropologist, collaborated on a dye-recipe book.\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nBurnside Myers won first place in the Navajo Tribal Fair in 1937. In 1939, she was invited to participate in the San Francisco Worlds Fair.\n\n\n== References ==",

The club had a significant impact on German football during the early 20th century. \n\n\n== History ==\nBFC Columbia 1896 Berlin was established in 1896 with the aim of promoting and developing football in the local community. It was one of the founding clubs of the DFB The club quickly rose to prominence and became one of the leading football clubs in Berlin.\nDuring its early years, Columbia actively participated in regional and city-level football competitions. The club's success on the field earned them recognition and respect within the Berlin football community. In 1904, they achieved a major milestone by winning the Berlin Football Championship (Berliner Fußballmeisterschaft).\nColumbia's performance continued to be impressive, leading to their inclusion as one of the founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) in 1900. This allowed them to compete in national-level competitions against other top clubs from across Germany.\nThe club experienced its golden era in the 1910s, securing multiple Berlin Football Championship titles. In 1912, they reached the final of the German championship, known as the Viktoria Pokal, ultimately losing the match against Holstein Kiel.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nBerlin Football Championship:\nWinners (multiple times, years unknown)\nGerman Championship:\nRunners-up: 1912\nFollowing the end of World War I, Columbia faced financial difficulties and internal conflicts, which led to a period of instability. The club struggled to maintain its previous level of success and gradually declined during the 1920s.\nDuring the era of Nazi Germany, Columbia confronted various challenges and restrictions imposed by the government. The club's activities were severely limited, and many of its Jewish members were forced to leave. These circumstances significantly impacted the club's performance, contributing to its further decline.\nIn 1945, at the conclusion of World War II, BFC Columbia 1896 Berlin was dissolved, like many other German clubs. It ceased to exist as a separate entity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFootball in Germany\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Pakistan wheat import scandal refers to a controversy that emerged in 2024, involving the importation of a significant amount of wheat by the caretaker government, despite the country having surplus wheat stocks. This decision allegedly caused a loss of more than 300 billion rupees to the national exchequer. The import of wheat was continued in the first two months of the Shehbaz Sharif government, as 778,000 metric tons worth of wheat, costing $231.32 million continued to be imported.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA summary of one million tonnes of wheat imports for strategic reserves was prepared during the caretaker government. However, in reality 2.778 thousand tons of wheat was ordered. The importation took place from September 2023 to March 2024. The decision to import wheat was taken during the previous caretaker government, and continued after the PML-N government assumed power.\n\n\n== Impact on farmers ==\nWheat imports led to a glut of wheat in the market, causing prices to fall and farmers to struggle to sell their produce at a reasonable price. Farmers were getting Rs 2,800 to Rs 3,000 for 40 kg of wheat while a support price of Rs 39,005 was promised. Due to this crisis, farmers resorted to protests in Lahore and many other Pakistani cities. \n\n\n== Nationwide protests ==\nIn response to the wheat crisis, the Kissan Ittehad Pakistan announced that thousands of farmers would participate in nationwide protests beginning May 10. The protest is aimed at the government's inability to purchase harvested wheat at the announced minimum support price of Rs 3,900 per millet. 40 kg.\n\n\n== Investigation and accountability ==\nAn inquiry committee was set up to investigate the scandal and determine responsibility. The committee began interviewing officials to identify those responsible for allowing imports of wheat due to the expected shortage. The preliminary report of the investigation has revealed that federal agencies are responsible for the unnecessary importation of wheat. The complete report was submitted to the government in three days.\nShehbaz Sharif directed the suspension of the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (PASCO) Managing Director (MD) and General Manager (GM) Procurement due to \"negligence and non-compliance with the PM’s instructions regarding the use of technology in the wheat procurement process,\" ordering third party audit of PASCO stock and additional procurement of 0.4 million metric tons (MMT) of wheat \"transparently and efficiently.\" \n\n\n== Reactions ==\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the wheat scandal. He alleged that the federal government's inquiry committee appeared to be an attempt to protect the big players involved in the scam.\nPakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Secretary General, Syed Nayyer Hussain Bukhari called for a NAB investigation on the scandal, stating \"The national treasury has incurred billions of rupees in losses due to the import of wheat, while farmers are on the streets despite bumper wheat production.\"\nPakistan Muslim League (N) Leader Nawaz Sharif summoned Shehbaz Sharif to Jati Umra to discuss the wheat scandal. In another meeting at Model Town he said that those involved in the \"wheat import scam should be taken to task,\" and supported accountability. Nawaz Sharif was given a briefing that said that claimed the Caretaker government was responsible for the wheat crisis. The current Punjab government also blamed the wheat import scandal on the previous care-taker administration.\nJamaat-i-Islami (JI) Party Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman on May 2 warned that his party would stage protests if the government \"persisted with its anti-farmer stance,\" called for the establishment of a judicial commission to investigate the scandal, urged the JI Kissan (farmer) chapter to liaise with farmer organizations and advocated for land reforms to distribute land among small farmers.\nFederation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Standing Committee on Agriculture on March 8 said that PASCO was operating in contradiction of the Prime Minister's directives through stopping wheat procurement and urged a third-party audit. Chaudhry Ahmad Jawad of the FPCCI further questioned the reason for importing wheat, the reducing of the procurement target, the delay in procuring, the sudden switch from written to online procedure and treatment of protesting farmers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Life and Death of Captain Cook is a 1888 Australian play by John Perry presented by Alfred Dampier to celebrate Australia's centenary.\nThe play won a prize for the best play depicting the life of Captain James Cook.\nAccording to Leslie Rees, \"Sydney had waxed happily excited from its public festivities, but even the genial tolerance of the Cook play’s first-night audience could not disguise a failure.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"As a literary production its dialogue is tame and mediocre, as a dramatic work the plot is loose and disjointed, and as a historical sketch the story is inaccurate and misleading.\"\nThe Daily Telegraph called it \"a feeble play of the conventional type, lacking in continuity, in interest and in dramatic effect. The dialogue is bald and slipshod, and the actors and actresses were to be pitied as they bravely\nstruggled through their evidently uncongenial task.\" \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Palmeria foremanii, commonly known as anchor vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Monimiaceae and is endemic to an area near the New South Wales - Queensland border. It is a tall, woody climber or scrambling shrub with usually elliptic leaves, male and female flowers on separate plants with 5 tepals, male flowers with 40 to 43 stamens, female flowers with 7 to 12 carpels, and spherical, shiny black drupes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPalmeria foremanii is a woody climber or scrambling shrub, its branchlets densely covered with star-shaped hairs. The leaves are usually elliptic, 30–115 mm (1.2–4.5 in) long and 15–50 mm (0.59–1.97 in) wide on a petiole 5–12 mm (0.20–0.47 in) long. The upper surface of the leaves is more or less glabrous and the lower surface is covered with golden-brown hairs. Male and female flowers are on separate plants and usually have 5 tepals. Male flowers are arranged in clusters of 7 to 13, 20–60 mm (0.79–2.36 in) long, each flower on a pedicel 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long, each with 40 to 43 stamens. Female flowers are arranged in clusters of 7 to 15, 20–75 mm (0.79–2.95 in) long, each flower on a pedicel 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long, each with 7 to 12 carpels. Flowering occurs from March to August and the fruit is a shiny black, more or less spherical drupe, 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPalmeria foremanii was first formally described in 2007 by Trevor Paul Whiffin in the Flora of Australia from specimens collected near The Head in 1978. The specific epithet (foremanii) was named in honour and remembrance of Donald Bruce Foreman.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species grows in subtropical or remnant rainforest between Mount Glorious in Queensland and the Whian Whian State Forest in New South Wales.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nPalmeria foremanii is listed as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johann Heinrich Gottfried Apetz Latinized as Henricum Apetz (24 February 1794 – 8 November 1857) was a German orientalist and entomologist. \nApetz was the son of Johann Gottfried Apetz who worked for the duke in Altenburg and Christiane Wilhelmina née Müller. He studied theology in Jena and became interested in orientalism with studies under  Kosegarten. He published a description of the Malabar region based on Ibn Battuta Arabic text in 1819 in Latin as Descriptio terrae Malabar. He worked at the Fellenberg Institute in Hofwiel near Bern and later taught at Altenburg. He also worked on the history of Herodotus along with A. Matthiae. He became a deacon in Lurka in 1826 and taught at the Friedrich-Gymnasium in Altenburg from 1830.\nApetz was interested in insects and described several species that were collected by others including Oskar Brehm. He is noted for amassing a large collection of beetles from East Asia. Scymnus apetzii was named after him by Mulsant in 1846. He married Marie née Thienemann and one of their sons, (Ernst) Theodor (d. 1898), accompanied the Brehms into Africa.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDescriptio terrae Malabar ex Arabico Ebn Batutae itinerario (1819)",

        "content": "Arrancada Heroica (English: Heroic Sprint) is the name used for the historic football match in São Paulo that marked, in 1942, the forced change of name of the Palestra Itália club from Palestra Itália to Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras. The fact begins with the pressure for the football club, of Italian origin, to change its name during the Second World War when Brazil, governed by then president Getúlio Vargas, declared war on the \"Axis\" countries (Germany, Italy and Japan) and aligned itself with the \"Allied\" countries (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and other countries). It ended with a 3–1 victory for Palmeiras in their first match under this name in a decisive game against São Paulo that won them the 1942 Campeonato Paulista title.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nDuring the Second World War, after maintaining a neutral position throughout the first three years of the conflict, in February 1942, Brazil broke diplomatic relations with the Axis countries, after the Germans and Italians began torpedoing Brazilian vessels in the Atlantic Ocean. This initiative was a sign of the position formalized months later, when Brazil joined the Allies and declared war on the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan).\nBefore that, in the same year, an ordinance approved in March 1942, under decree number 4,166, determined that assets belonging to Germans, Italians and Japanese, both individuals and legal entities, could be confiscated and used by the Brazilian government for compensate for losses generated by countries in the war against Brazil. Another determination by the government of Getúlio Vargas was carried out through a decree that prohibited any entity from using names related to Axis countries, under penalty of loss of assets.\nWith increasing pressure, several clubs linked to the axis were forced to change their names. The most emblematic cases are: Palestra Italia (Italian origin), Deutsch Sportive and Sport Club Germânia (both were of German origin) in São Paulo. And Palestra Italia in Belo Horizonte (from the Italian colony) was also forced to change its name, giving rise to Cruzeiro, in Minas Gerais.\n\n\n=== Name change ===\nIn March 1942, trying to avoid complications, the São Paulo-based Palestra Itália decided to change the name to Palestra de São Paulo. Another change was made to the institutional shield, which gained a more nationalist adaptation, with the removal of the color red and the addition of a yellow tone, in reference to the colors of the Brazilian flag.\nThe changes were not enough, as the political pressures of the time were immense. For some sectors of society, despite the word “lecture” having Greek origins, it referred to Italy. Therefore, the demands for name changes and punishments were increasing. Leaders of the then Palestra still accuse São Paulo Futebol Clube as one of the opponents responsible for the greatest pressure in political circles, since, according to them, there was interest from the rival in the Estadio Parque Antartica. In São Paulo, the thesis about the stadium is considered to be a \"fantasy\".\nOn the night of September 14, 1942, the Palestra board met in an extraordinary session to discuss the demand for a total change of name. After hours of discussion and resistance, and the suggestion of names such as Piratininga and Paulista, it was finally decided on Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, partly due to the preservation of the letter P on the club's shields and symbols, and partly in honor of the Associação Atlética das Palmeiras, a club that was then extinct but which always maintained an excellent relationship with Palestra Itália, having provided decisive support on several occasions of disputes with São Paulo football directors.\nThe meeting that brought the definitive name change from Palestra to Palmeiras was held days before the decisive game that could have won the 1942 Campeonato Paulista.\n\n\n=== The Arrancada Heroica ===\nThe match took place on September 20, 1942, Palmeiras entered the field for the first time with the name that is still known today. In order to avoid the \"boos\" that were promised by their rivals, the team appeared on the Pacaembu Stadium lawn with a Brazilian flag, carried by the then 2nd vice-president of the club, Adalberto Mendes, who was captain of the Brazilian Army. The initiative and the moving image, later called Arrancada Heroica, was applauded by the fans present and helped to ease the pressure on the alviverde team.\nThe game with São Paulo was tense and violent, with Palmeiras winning 3–1, and the Tricolores refusing to play the rest of the second half, an act done as a form of response and protest against refereeing, when the referee awarded a penalty committed by Virgílio in Og Moreira. With the score and the São Paulino protest, Palmeiras won the first cup with the new name. With the defeat, São Paulo finished third, behind Corinthians, runner-up.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFootball in Brazil\n1942 Campeonato Paulista\nSociedade Esportiva Palmeiras\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peltigera isidiophora is a species of foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. It is characterised by its laminal clustered isidia that grow in pits, a shiny and scarred grey upper surface, and its thin, sparse, and simple rhizines. It is known only from its original collection location in Hebei, China, where it grows on moss and on soil in montane forest.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPeltigera isidiophora was described as a new species in 2015 by lichenologists Liu-Fu Han and Shou-Yu Guo. The type specimen of the species was collected in China, within Hebei Province on Xiaowutai Mountain. This specimen, designated as the holotype, was gathered from the ground at an elevation of 1,850 m (6,070 ft). The collection was conducted on 11 August 2013 by researchers Shou-Yu Guo, Liu-Fu Han, and Wen-Xia Liu. It is preserved in the herbarium of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The species epithet isidiophora derives from the Greek isidion, meaning small granules, referring to the isidia on the lichen's surface.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe lichen features a foliose, thin, and fragile thallus, forming roughly circular patches about 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) in diameter. The lobes are flattened, elongate, 1.0–2.8 cm wide, and can extend up to 8.0 cm (3.1 in) long, often with a dichotomous branching pattern. The upper surface is typically pale grey to dark grey, turning to blackish grey when wet, and displays a characteristic pattern of clustered isidia along its surface, particularly on damaged or older parts.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are rare and develop at the tips of the lobes, have an erect, saddle-shaped form, measuring up to 4.0 mm (1⁄8 in) in diameter. The margins of these reproductive structures range from smooth to crenulate. The colour of the apothecial discs shifts from red-brown when wet to dark brown when dry, and they have smooth, somewhat shiny surfaces. The paraphyses are simple and septate, with a thickening at the tips. The asci are clavate (club-shaped), ranging from 45.0 to 75.0 by 6.0 to 12.0 micrometres (μm), and typically contain eight spores. These ascospores are acicular and variably septate, measuring between 30.0 and 60.0 by 2.5 to 5.0 μm. Pycnidia, an asexual reproductive structure, have not been observed to occur in this species.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nPeltigera isidiophora grows on moss or soil within temperate forests dominated by species such as Betula platyphylla and Populus davidiana. At the time of its original publication, it was known only from its type locality on Xiaowutai Mountain in Hebei Province, China, at an elevation of 1850 m.\nThis species typically coexists with other Peltigera species and members of the genus Cladonia. It is one of 27 species of Peltigera that occur in China.\n\n\n== References ==",

Tabriz, Azerbaijan Province, Safavid Empire - d. 1774–1775, Tabriz, Tabriz Khanate) was a poet who wrote poems in Azerbaijani Turkish and Persian.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAbdurrazzaq Nasha Tabrizi was born in the city of Tabriz at the end of the 17th century. He was descended from Jahan shah, one of the Qara Qoyunlu rulers. Like Jahan Shah, Nasha Tabrizi also wrote poems in Azerbaijani Turkish and Persian. In addition, Nasha Tabrizi, a soldier, participated in Nadir Shah Afshar's campaign in India.\nHe became famous for the ghazals he wrote during the reign of Nadir Shah. Influenced by Saib Tabrizi, he also wrote poems in \"Indian style\".  In 1741–1742, after Nadir Shah repaired the dome of Imam Ali's mausoleum, Nasha Tabrizi wrote a poem in Azerbaijani Turkish, and this poem was recorded on the main door of the mausoleum.\nA manuscript copy of Tabrizi's dīvān is kept in the Topkapı Palace Museum. This copy was written in 1763. Dīvān has 3 qasida and 6 ghazals in Azerbaijani Turkish.\nAlthough there are some opinions about the date of his death, according to Muhammad Ali Hosseini and Muhammad Amin Riyahi, Nasha Tabrizi died in Tabriz in 1775.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Soruces ==\nPaşa Kərimov (2020).

        "content": "Maycock Plantation, also known as Maycock's Plantation and Maycox Plantation, among the first plantations on the south side of the James River in Prince George County, Virginia, was settled by Samuel Maycock about 1618 or 1619, during the early Colonial period of Virginia. The former plantation is now part of the James River National Wildlife Refuge, and is located off Flowerdew Hundred Road And James River Drive, Prince George, Virginia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBefore Jamestown was colonized in 1607, Weyanoke people and earlier Native Americans lived in the area from about 8,000 B.C. in what is now the James River National Wildlife Refuge. Seven archaeological sites show habitation from the Early Archaic through the Late Woodland periods. Artifacts include stone tools, projectile points, and ceramics. There is evidence of an agricultural culture. Their land was usurped by the English colonists. After decades of conflicts, known as the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, the Weyanoke people left the area in 1644. A ferry was established by 1705 at Maycock's Point to cross the James River. Soon after, the local economy was based upon corn and tobacco crops. There had been a mill on Powell's Creek, which was damaged during the Civil War, after which it was restored and operated for a few decades. By the early 1900s, much of what is now the refuge was wooded.\n\n\n== Samuel Maycock ==\nSamuel Maycock, born a gentleman, was a scholar of the University of Cambridge in England. In the Colony of Virginia, he sat on the Virginia Governor's Council. Maycock patented 1,700 acres for his plantation in 1618. He was working on the land on March 22, 1622, with Edward Lister and another man when they were massacred by Weyanoke people during the Indian massacre of 1622.\n\nAt the time, Maycock had an infant child named Sarah who survived the attack. There was not much work done on the plantation for several decades due to the threat of attack by Native Americans. In 1638, Sarah Maycock married George Pace, the son of Richard Pace. George, or his son Richard Pace II, is believed to have built the 17th-century house.\nIn 1970, an archaeological team led by Dr. Ben McCary and Dr. Norman Barka from College of William & Mary unearthed a foundation of a house built between 1640 and 1660. It is believed to have been a two-story house about 60 by 20 feet (18.3 by 6.1 m), with three rooms on each floor. Situated on a bluff, it was built upon a former Native American site of the Weyanoke people that overlooked the James River. It may have been destroyed in the Third Anglo-Powhatan War of 1644 or at another time by other means. Richard Pace lived at Maycock Plantation near Powells Creek in 1659.\n\n\n== Subsequent owners ==\nGeorge Pace sold 800 to 900 acres in 1650 to Thomas Drew. Roger Drayton sold 250 acres to John Hamlin  in 1696, who sold the land to Thomas Ravenscroft in 1723.\nIn 1772, acreage of various sizes on a seat called Maycox was put up for sale by George M. Meade and John Ravenscroft. The land was good for wheat and Indian corn.\n\n\n== David Meade and the revolution ==\nDavid Meade bought the plantation in 1774. The plantation's \"long, narrow terraced raised walks that offered excellent viewing platforms, formed circulation routes through the landscape, and made ideal venues for social promenade,\" built according to François-Jean de Chastellux in residential settings, such as Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Maycock Plantation, in 18th-century America.\nDavid Meade Jr. (1744–1830) lived there with his wife Sarah Waters Meade, the daughter of Sarah (née Prentis, 1749–1829) and William Waters, sometime after 1774, where he \"dabbled in English-style garden design.\" Educated in England, he helped finance that American Revolution. Charles Cornwallis, commander of the British forces, crossed the James River in May 1781 and in August Anthony Wayne crossed the river near or at the plantation of 600 acres. Meade lived there until 1796, when he sold the plantation.\n\n\n== Carter Bassett Harrison ==\nIn 1800, Carter Bassett Harrison settled in Prince George County, Virginia at Maycock Plantation (Maycox Plantation), along the James River. William Allen Harrison lived at Maycox Plantation. He died in 1824 and Carter Bassett Harrison inherited his father's plantation and 25 enslaved people according to William Allen Harrison's will dated May 22 of that year.\n\n\n== Civil War ==\nIn 1864, Union General Ulysses S. Grant had a pontoon bridge built nearby to cross the river en route to the Siege of Petersburg.\n\n\n== Historic marker ==\nThe historic marker for Maycock's Plantation states,\n\nSamuel Maycock, a member of the governor's Council who served in Virginia's first legislative assembly in 1619, patented land originally inhabited by Virginia Indians about four miles north on the James River. The area became a tobacco plantation that continued to operate after Maycock was killed in 1622 during a surprise attack at the outset of the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. The labor of enslaved Africans and African Americans sustained the plantation under later owners. In 1781, during the Revolutionary War, British and American armies likely crossed the river at the property. In the summer of 1862, several enslaved families escaped to Union lines. Union forces soon burned the main house.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMary Beaudry, archaeologist, study of shell-midden at Maycock Plantation\nList of plantations in Virginia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaycock Plantation (historical), Topozone.com",

        "content": "HR 2024 (HD 39118/19, BD+01 1148) is a spectroscopic binary star in the constellation Orion. It is made up from a cool primary (a K-type giant star) and a hot companion, which is a binary star formed from a B-type main-sequence star and an A-type main-sequence star. Based on a parallax measurement from Hipparcos, the system is located at 346 parsecs (1,130 ly) from Earth, with mild error margins. The apparent magnitude of the star is 5.976, making it visible to the naked eye only from locations not affected by light pollution.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nHR 2024 is a spectroscopic binary (more precisely a single-lined spectroscopic binary) made up of a cool primary and a hot companion. The cool primary has a spectral type of K0II, corresponding to a K-type star with a bright giant luminosity class. The hot companion is binary, made up by two stars with spectral types of B7V/B8V and A0V, corresponding to a B-type main-sequence star and an A-type main-sequence star respectively.\nThe two components are separated by a distance of 4.7×108 kilometres (3.1 AU), and complete an orbit around each other every 2,570 days (7 years). The orbital eccentricity is equivalent to 0.3.\nHR 2024 is in the constellation Orion, based on its astronomical coordinates. It is located about 346 parsecs (1,130 light-years) away, based on a parallax of 2.89±0.83 milliarcseconds from the Hipparcos satellite. This parallax has a considerable margin of error (about 30% of the parallax itself), which attributes an uncertainty of 99 parsecs (320 light-years) to the distance. The star has an apparent magnitude of 5.976. At this magnitude, it is very faint can be visible to the naked eye only in rural skies. The absolute magnitude, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at a distance or 10 parsecs (32.6 ly), is –2.53. It is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 4.24 km/s.\n\n\n=== Primary star ===\nThe primary star of the system is an evolved K-type bright giant (spectral type K0 II) that reached the horizontal branch stage of evolution. It has expanded to 29 times the Sun's size and is emitting over 540 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,550 K, which is 1,228 K cooler than the Sun. It has a mass equivalent to 3.4 times the solar mass and a subsolar metallicity, having an abundance of iron on its surface is equivalent to 46% that of the Sun. The age of the primary is estimated at 263 million years and it rotates under its own axis at a velocity of 4.19 km/s. It has a B-V index of 1.12, giving a typical orange hue of a K-type star.\n\n\n=== Hot companion ===\nThe hot companion is made up of two other stars, one is a late B-type main-sequence star (spectral type B7V/B8V) and the other is an A-type main-sequence star (spectral type A0V). It has an absolute magnitude about 1.55 magnitudes fainter than the primary companion. The B-type star has an effective temperature of 11,300 K. The B-V index of the hot companion is of –0.09, meaning that it has a typical hue of a B-type star.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moorooboora (c.1758 – January 1798), also known as Moroobra or Maroubra, was a leader of the Murro-ore-dial clan of the Eora people who resided in what is now the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney. He was the father of Cora Gooseberry and the father-in-law of the prominent Indigenous Australian sailor Bungaree.\n\n\n== Moorooboora and Colebe ==\nIn December 1797, tribal fighting resulted in Colebe, a friend of Bennelong, killing a man named Yeranibe in a cowardly manner. Yeranibe's friends, including Gnunga Gnunga Murremurgan and Moorooboora seized their weapons, determined to take revenge on Colebe and members of his family. Colebe and one of his relations were beaten very severely, but were not killed.\nColebe later faced a traditional trial of justice by having spears thrown at him, but was saved from death by some British soldiers. Unhappy with this interference of ritual law, Moorooboora and several associates later made a further attack on Colebe in January 1798. After several blows on the head, it was supposed that Colebe was dead, but upon seeing him attempting to get up, Moorooboora returned to land the final blow. However, one of Colebe's friends speared Moorooboora before he could hit Colebe. The spear entered Moorooboora over the hip bone, going through his body, penetrating the bladder in its passage. Moorooboora died of this wound about an hour later.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMoorooboora's name is derived from muru (meaning pathway) and boora (meaning initiation ground). In particular, it refers to the pathway that went to the initiation ground that was at Boora Point in south-eastern Sydney and is how the present suburb of Maroubra gets its name.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\n\n\n== References ==",

The club had a significant impact on German football during the early 20th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nBFC Columbia 1896 Berlin was established in 1896 with the aim of promoting and developing football in the local community. The club quickly rose to prominence and became one of the leading football clubs in Berlin.\nDuring its early years, Columbia actively participated in regional and city-level football competitions. The club's success on the field earned them recognition and respect within the Berlin football community. In 1904, they achieved a major milestone by winning the Berlin Football Championship (Berliner Fußballmeisterschaft).\nColumbia's performance continued to be impressive, leading to their inclusion as one of the founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) in 1900. This allowed them to compete in national-level competitions against other top clubs from across Germany.\nThe club experienced its golden era in the 1910s, securing multiple Berlin Football Championship titles. In 1912, they reached the final of the German championship, known as the Viktoria Pokal, ultimately losing to Holstein Kiel.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nBerlin Football Championship:\nWinners (multiple times, years unknown)\nGerman Championship:\nRunners-up: 1912\nFollowing the end of World War I, Columbia faced financial difficulties and internal conflicts, which led to a period of instability. The club struggled to maintain its previous level of success and gradually declined during the 1920s.\nDuring the era of Nazi Germany, Columbia confronted various challenges and restrictions imposed by the government. The club's activities were severely limited, and many of its Jewish members were forced to leave. These circumstances significantly impacted the club's performance, contributing to its further decline.\nIn 1945, at the conclusion of World War II, BFC Columbia 1896 Berlin was dissolved, like many other German clubs. It ceased to exist as a separate entity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFootball in Germany\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ratho Farm Golf Links is an 18-hole golf course that was constructed on the Ratho Farm in Bothwell, Tasmania.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first game of golf in Tasmania, and among the earliest games of golf in Australia, was played in Bothwell. The course at the Ratho property was until recently thought to be the oldest golf course in Australia, which was thought to have been built in the mid-1850s. Jane Williams, daughter of Ratho's first owner Alexander Reid, wrote in 1890 that golf was first played in the area sometime before 1860: \"...it (golf) was introduced over 30 years ago by Mr. William Wood, brother of Mr. Dennistoun Wood, of Dennistoun, and that it flourished as long as the Scottish element prevailed in the Bothwell district, when through death and other changes golf ceased to be practised in Bothwell.\"\nAlexander Arthur Reid of Ratho, grandson of the above-mentioned Alexander Reid, wrote in 1930 that his father, Alexander Reid Jr., penned a letter written in the early 1860s stating that he was starting a golf club in Bothwell with 15 or 16 members. Arthur Alexander Reid also mentioned that he remembered the \"queer-shaped old clubs.\"\n\nThe newly opened links at Ratho were reported in The Tasmanian Mail in August 1911: \"Mr and Mrs. Reid gave a golf afternoon on the newly laid-out Ratho links, at Bothwell, on Saturday, when a handicap mixed foursomes for trophies given by the host and hostess was played... The new course is a really excellent one, the turf being naturally suitable for golf, and the grass greens are all wonderfully good. Every hole has its difficulties, and the spoiling nature of the course adds to its attractiveness. The length of the course (9 holes) is 2,551 yards.\nGolf in Australia started at Grose Farm in Sydney, with the first reliably documented match played in 1839 by A.B. Spark.\nBothwell is home to the Australian Golf Museum, housed in the sandstone former school house.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of links golf courses\nList of oldest companies in Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The 2024–25 CONCACAF Nations League A is the top division of the 2024–25 edition of the CONCACAF Nations League, the fourth season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 41 member associations of CONCACAF. The initial group stage will be held from 2 September to 15 October 2024.\nLeague A will culminate with the Nations League Finals in March 2025 to crown the champions of the CONCACAF Nations League.\nThis edition of the CONCACAF Nations League A will serve to determine the four teams that qualify directly for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States. The top four teams will qualify for the final tournament while the remaining League A teams can still qualify via the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification tournament.\n\n\n== Format ==\nLeague A maintains the same format introduced for the 2023–24 season, consisting of a group stage, a quarter-finals round, a play-in round and the finals. The 16 involved teams entering the competition in the group stage or directly into the quarter-finals according to their position in the CONCACAF Rankings (as of 31 March 2024), with the 12 lowest-ranked teams entering the group stage and the top 4 ranked teams receiving a direct pass to the quarter-final round.\nThe group stage consists of two groups of six teams with each team playing four matches against opponents of its group (two at home and two away) on a Swiss-system basis. The top two teams from each group will advance to the quarter-finals where they will join the 4 teams that qualified directly to this round. The bottom two teams from each group will be relegated to the 2025–26 CONCACAF Nations League B, but will also advance to the play-in round in which they will join 4 teams from the League C in order to compete to qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification tournament.\nThe quarter-finals will be played on a two-legged home-and-away basis with the four winners advancing to the Nations League Finals and qualifying directly to the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Nations League Finals, consisting of a semi-final round, third place play-off and the final match, will be played in March 2025 at a centralised venue to be announced.\n\n\n=== 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification ===\nAs announced by CONCACAF in February 2023, the 2024–25 CONCACAF Nations League will serve as a qualifier for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. League A teams will qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup final tournament or the Gold Cup qualification tournament (also called CONCACAF Gold Cup prelims) or advance to the play-in round based on their performance in the group stage and quarter-finals round, as follows:\n\nThe four quarter-finals winners (i.e., the 4 teams involved in the finals) will qualify directly for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\nThe four quarter-finals losers will qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification.\nThe third and fourth placed teams of each group will also qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification.\nThe fifth and sixth placed teams of each group will advance to the play-in round where they will face the top 4 teams in the League C for the last 4 slots in the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nA total of sixteen national teams contest the League A, including the top twelve sides from the 2023–24 season and four promoted from the 2023–24 League B.\n\n\n=== Team changes ===\nThe following were the team changes in League A regarding the 2023–24 season:\n\n\n==== Teams promoted from League B ====\nFrench Guiana, Guadeloupe and Guyana reached the top flight of the CONCACAF Nations League for the first time, with French Guaiana and Guyana spending the first three seasons in League B while Guadeloupe started in League C in the inaugural edition before spending two seasons in League B. Nicaragua had already been promoted to the League A in the previous season but were disqualified for regulatory reasons before the start of the season, so this will be their first appearance in CONCACAF Nations League A.\n\n\n=== Seeding ===\nThe pots were confirmed on 19 April 2024, with the lowest twelve League A ranked teams, based on the CONCACAF Rankings as of 31 March 2024, being split into six pots of two teams. The top four ranked teams (Mexico, the United States, Panama and Canada) were directly seeded in the quarter-finals.\n\n\n=== Draw ===\nThe group stage draw was held on 6 May 2024, 19:00 EDT (UTC−4), in Miami, Florida, United States, where the twelve involved teams were drawn into two groups of six. The draw began by randomly selecting a team from Pot 1 and placing them into Group A and then selecting the remaining team from Pot 1 and placing them into Group B. The draw continued with the same procedure done for the remaining pots.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\n\n\n== Group stage ==\nAll match times are in EDT (UTC−4) as listed by CONCACAF (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n== Quarter-finals ==\nThe quarter-finals pairings will be determined based on the CONCACAF Rankings published after the October 2024 FIFA Match Window for the four pre-seeded teams and the group stage results for the winners and runners-up of each group. The four pre-seeded teams that received a direct bye to the quarter-finals (Canada, Mexico, Panama and the United States) will have the chance to decide the order of legs.\n\nThe match-ups will be as follows:\n\nQuarter-final 1 (QF1): Fourth ranked pre-seeded team vs Best ranked group winner\nQuarter-final 2 (QF2): Third ranked pre-seeded team vs Next ranked group winner\nQuarter-final 3 (QF3): Second ranked pre-seeded team vs Best ranked group runner-up\nQuarter-final 4 (QF4): First ranked pre-seeded team vs Next ranked group runner-up\nEach tie is played on a home-and-away two-legged basis. If the aggregate score is level at the end of the second leg the away goals rule would be applied. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time would be played without taking into account the away goals rule during this time. If still tied after extra time, the tie would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nWinners will advance to the Nations League Finals and qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, while losers will qualify for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs will be played on 11–19 November, and the second legs will be played on 11–19 November 2024.\n\nNote: Order of legs has not been announced.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\nWinner advances to the Finals and qualifies for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Pairings will be determined based on the teams' results during the group stage.\n\nThe match-ups will be as follows:\n\nPlay-in 1 (PI1): League A best 5th placed team vs League C best group runner-up\nPlay-in 2 (PI2): League A next 5th placed team vs League C third best group winner\nPlay-in 3 (PI3): League A best 6th placed team vs League C second best group winner\nPlay-in 4 (PI4): League A next 6th placed team vs League C best group winner\nEach tie is played on a home-and-away two-legged basis, with the order of legs to be determined in due course.
