However, the club experienced a decline in performance in the following years and eventually merged with Amisia Papenburg.\nAmisia Papenburg, founded in 1909, also had its moments of success, including a stint in the Verbandsliga West, the second-highest division in Lower Saxony at the time. After the merger, SC Blau-Weiß Papenburg initially played in the Bezirksliga Weser-Ems, eventually earning promotion to the Landesliga Weser-Ems in 1999.\nIn the 2002/03 season, SC Blau-Weiß Papenburg achieved promotion to the Oberliga Niedersachsen, the fifth tier of German football. However, the club was unable to establish itself in the league and was relegated back to the Landesliga. Currently, SC Blau-Weiß Papenburg competes in the Landesliga Weser-Ems.\nThe team plays its home matches at the Parkstadion Obenende in Papenburg, which has a capacity of 4,000 spectators. The club has a local rivalry with FC Germania 95 Papenburg, a club founded by opponents of the merger between Germania Papenburg and Amisia Papenburg.\nAs of the 2022/23 season, SC Blau-Weiß Papenburg finished in 18th position in the Oberliga Niedersachsen and was relegated back to the Landesliga Weser-Ems.\nCategory:Football clubs in Germany",

After many years as an astronomer and planetary scientist, she has shifted her interests to Earth-based agricultural applications of remote sensing, as Head of Remote Science and Geospatial Intelligence for Bayer Crop Science. Her work in astronomy studied the chemical composition of objects in the far reaches of the Solar System, with a special focus on tholins, and included the discovery of ammonia on Pluto, suggesting the possibility of liquid water there as well.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nDalle Ore is originally from Treviso; astronomy was a shared interest with her father, heart surgeon Mario Morea. She earned a laurea in astronomy, the Italian equivalent of a master's degree, from the University of Padua, in 1983. Next, she began graduate studies with  Sandra Faber at the University of California, Santa Cruz, but was pulled away to Boston by her new husband's job there. After spending nine years raising three children and studying spectroscopy at Harvard University, she returned to UC Santa Cruz to complete her Ph.D. Her 1993 dissertation, A critical examination of stellar atmosphere theory for metal-poor K-giant stars, was supervised by Faber.\nDespite her early research focus on stars, a chance social connection with planetary scientist Dale Cruikshank led her to a position studying the Solar System as a research scientist for the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center. She worked there beginning in 1996, with a stint as a lecturer at UC Santa Cruz from 2007 to 2008, until taking her present position at Bayer Crop Science.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nMinor planets 25945 Moreadalleore and 151351 Dalleore are named for Dalle Ore.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCristina Dalle Ore publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "Nathaniel Harvey (March 21, 1950 – November 27, 2020) was an American murderer and suspected serial killer who was sentenced to death in New Jersey for the 1985 rape-murder of a woman in Plainsboro. He was one of only eight men on New Jersey's death row when it was abolished in 2007 by then-Governor Jon Corzine. He was re-sentenced to life in prison and died at South Woods State Prison in 2020. A few years after his death, he was linked through DNA evidence to a separate rape-murder committed in East Windsor in 1984, and investigators have since speculated he could have committed other killings.\n\n\n== Crimes ==\n\n\n=== 1978 Middlesex County rape ===\nOn October 16, 1978, Harvey was driving through Monroe Township in Middlesex County when he began tailing a car being driven by a 24-year-old woman. He followed her home and pulled into her driveway, and approached the woman asking about her family's business. When she went inside to get information, Harvey forced his way in and attacked her. He raped and beat her before the victim managed to escape through a rear window and ran to a neighbor's home for help. Coincidently, the woman had been raped just months prior by 45-year-old Herman Schmidt, who had no known connection to Harvey.\nHarvey turned himself in on October 20 after the victim identified him from a series of photographs. He was charged with rape, assault with intent to rape, atrocious assault, battery, burglary and lewdness. He was convicted of four of these charges in March 1979 and was sentenced to 15–20 years in prison. He was imprisoned at New Jersey State Prison until a New Jersey Parole Board granted him parole in early 1983.\n\n\n=== Murder of Donna Macho ===\nDonna Macho, a 19-year-old Hightstown High School graduate, disappeared from her parents' home in East Windsor on February 26, 1984. Her car was discovered several miles away with blood stains on the passenger seat, leading investigators to believe she had been murdered. Police suspected her kidnapper carried her out of the house and forced her to drive to a secluded location. Detectives also discovered evidence of a sexual assault as semen was found in Macho's bedroom. A reward of $2,000 was put up by her parents for information.\nOn April 2, 1995, a boy scout troop discovered skeletal remains in a wooded area in Cranbury. Along with the remains, pieces of clothing and jewelry were discovered in the immediate area. Through dental records, the remains were identified as belonging to Macho, over eleven years after she went missing.\n\n\n=== Murder of Irene Schnaps ===\nOn June 17, 1985, the body of 37-year-old Irene Schnaps was discovered inside her Princeton Meadows apartment in Plainsboro Township. The discovery was made by a coworker who went to Schnaps' apartment after she failed to show up to her job at an RCA plant. The initial investigation into her death revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a blunt object. A bloody sneaker print left by her killer was discovered at the crime scene.\nOn October 28, Harvey was arrested for attempting to kidnap a 13-year-old girl in West Windsor earlier that same month. In a search of his vehicle, police discovered a watch that matched the description of a watch that had been stolen from Schnaps' apartment. Subsequently, a sneaker print that was collected from his vehicle was matched to the one found in Schnaps' apartment. Afterwards, Harvey was charged with her murder and pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n== Convictions, death sentence and appeals ==\nHarvey went to trial on September 30, 1986. On the first day, assistant prosecutor Thomas J. Kapsak claimed that, upon his arrest, Harvey confessed to killing Schnaps before later recanting. Harvey's defense denied this and proclaimed their client was innocent. The alleged confession was key as to why the jury found Harvey guilty on all counts on October 10, and seven days later imposed a verdict of death. After his death sentence, Harvey attempted to get a new trial on the basis that his alleged confession should not have been used at trial. In 1991, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Harvey's confession should not have been used as evidence and he was granted a new trial.\nHarvey's second trial spanned from October to December 1994, and he was again convicted and sentenced to death. In 2007, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, a death penalty opponent, signed legislation that officially eliminated capital punishment in the state; because of this, Harvey and the other seven New Jersey death row inmates were resentenced to life in prison. In 2015, Harvey appealed his conviction and again was granted a new trial. In 2017, an appeals court upheld the decision granting Harvey a third trial.\n\n\n== Death and aftermath ==\nOn November 27, 2020, Harvey died at South Woods State Prison while awaiting his third trial.\nIn April 2023, investigators announced they had linked Harvey to Macho's murder based on his DNA matching the semen found in her bed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of serial killers in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

Murtagh was killed around 1577 in the Massacre of Mullaghmast, a mass killing of Gaelic nobility. His cousin, infamous rebel and Lord of Laois Rory O'More, avenged Murtagh's death by gathering an army and burning the town of Naas.\n\n\n== References ==",

He embarked for the Americas from El Puerto de Santa María on 22 November 1735. There were more than forty Jesuits aboard the ship with him, including Alexandro Rapicani and Jacobo Sedelmayr. On 18 February 1736, they were shipwrecked on the island of San Juan de Ulúa; there were no casualties, and the Jesuits continued on to Mexico City.\nBy 1737, García was Visitor General of the Jesuits in New Spain. That spring, he visited several of the Sonoran missions, including Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi and Mission Santa María Suamca. He served as provincial superior from 1747 to 1750. \nAs provincial superior, García supported the construction of the Convent of Corpus Christi, Mexico City in Mexico City for indigenous women, arguing that they were honest, humble, and as intelligent as Europeans. He also altered the Jesuit regulations on corporal punishment of natives in a 1747 order, raising the maximum number of lashes from eight to twenty-five.\nGarcía's last known post was as spiritual advisor at the Colegio Seminario de San Gregorio in Mexico. \n\n\n== References ==",

The CIRC's stated goals were to clean the balance sheets of government-owned financial institutions, facilitate their privatization, revive struggling industrial units, and create employment opportunities.\nDuring its operational period, the CIRC was involved in the privatization and corporate mergers of several banks, including Habib Bank Limited, United Bank Limited, National Development Finance Corporation, Industrial Development Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and Allied Bank Limited. Four of these banks were privatized as a result of this initiative. The corporation disposed of 151 non-performing assets (NPAs), resulting in a government surplus of over Rs 1 billion. It also restructured and rescheduled 252 NPAs with a gross debt value of Rs 45.9 billion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Outlaw Spire, also known as \"Hardscrabble Spire,\" is a sandstone pillar located within Canyonlands National Park, in San Juan County, Utah, United States. It is situated in the Island in the Sky District of the park at the top of Hardscrabble Hill at the western tip of Bighorn Mesa. This landform is composed of Wingate Sandstone, which is the remains of wind-borne sand dunes deposited approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic. Precipitation runoff from Outlaw Spire drains into the nearby Green River which is 1,000 feet (305 meters) below, and less than one-quarter mile away from the tower in Labyrinth Canyon. Access is via the White Rim Road which skirts beneath this remote spire.\n\n\n== Climbing ==\nThe first ascent of the summit was made on May 14, 1993, by Bill Ellwood and Bryan Ferguson via the South-Southwest Face. That same month, James Funsten and Chris Sircello climbed the North Face. The climbing routes are rated class 5.10 A3. In April 2001, Jim Beyer soloed the West Face via a route called Cult of Suicidal (5.9 A6). \n\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 °F (0 °C) and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than 10 inches (250 millimeters) of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter. Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Outlaw Spire.\n\n\n== See also ==\nColorado Plateau\nGeology of the Canyonlands area\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanyonlands National Park National Park Service\nHardscrabble Tower Climbing: Mountainproject.com",

        "content": "Reepham Town Hall is a municipal building in Back Street, Reepham, Norfolk, a town in England. The building, which was originally commissioned as a school, is currently used for as the offices and meeting place of Reepham Town Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-19th century, the new Rector of Reepham, Frederick Field, who had been a classical scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, launched an initiative to commission two schools for the area. The first of these was a school for the village of Reepham itself: the site he selected was on Norwich Road and he financed the school himself. It was designed in the Tudor style, built in red brick with stone dressings and opened as Reepham St Mary's School in 1847.\nThe second school was for the small surrounding settlements of Hackford (to the west) and Whitwell (to the southwest): the site he selected was in Back Street on land which was already part of the grounds of his church. It was designed in the Victorian style, built in red brick with stone dressings and opened as the Hackford and Whitwell Parochial School in 1860. The design involved a rectangular shaped building which faced north onto the churchyard. There was a doorway in the left-hand bay; the other bays were fenestrated by sash windows with architraves. Internally, the principal rooms were the main assembly hall and a large kitchen.\nFollowing the implementation of the Elementary Education Act 1870 and the formation of Aylsham Rural District Council in 1894, the local education authority decided to establish a board school to be known as Reepham Primary School in what became known as School Road. The two schools, which had been commissioned by Field, were already too small and, being redundant, closed in 1903 and 1901 respectively.\nIn the early 20th century, the parish council agreed that the former Hackford and Whitwell Parochial School should be converted for community use and was designated Reepham Town Hall. The building was used for a variety of community events including dances in the 1950s. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Reepham Parish Council was succeeded by Reepham Town Council and the new council used the town hall as its offices and meeting place.\nThe town hall was used as a civil defence headquarters in the television programme The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor, part of the series, Agatha Christie's Poirot, which was broadcast in February 1991. In 2021, Reepham Nursery School proposed relocating to the building, but this was opposed by several community groups which held activities in the building.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bamako is the debut album by the OGJB Quartet, a collaborative ensemble named after the first letters of the musicians' first names, featuring saxophonist Oliver Lake, cornetist Graham Haynes, double bassist Joe Fonda, and drummer Barry Altschul. It was recorded on July 2, 2016, at System Two Studios in Brooklyn, New York, and was released in 2019 by TUM Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for All About Jazz, Jerome Wilson wrote: \"This group has all the power, flash and muscle you would expect. Lake's heavy soul and Haynes' cool fire pair up wonderfully while Fonda is a primal force and Altschul's responsiveness to his bandmates and creativity is masterful. This is one of the musical highlights of the year and hopefully these four men continue to play together for some time.\" AAJ's Dan McClenaghan called the album \"an innovative free-jazz outing,\" and stated that it \"presents a free-end-of-the spectrum sound that breaks new ground while maintaining its grip on a late-fifties/mid-sixties foundation of flexibility.\"\nPeter Gamble of Jazz Journal commented: \"composing duties are shared and there's the usual problem of discerning where the written ends (or indeed starts) and the improvisation begins... This is definitely a session to appeal to those who prefer their music to exist a long way outside the mainstream.\"\nWriting for Point of Departure, Ed Hazell remarked: \"The all-star OGJB Quartet... plays urgent and passionate music with calm authority and assurance... Every element of this masterful album contributes to that feeling of inevitability and surprise that is the hallmark of great jazz.\"\nPhil Freeman of Stereogum praised the long opening track, describing it as \"a bouncing, churning free jazz journey,\" and writing: \"The way the horns dance past and around each other, over Fonda's booming bass and Altschul's constant but constantly shifting rhythms, reminds me of the equally amazing quartet Other Dimensions in Music. Let this piece carry you away; it won't feel like a quarter hour, I swear.\"\nIn an article for The Arts Fuse, Steve Feeney called Bamako \"an impressive album that looks backward and forward in time while staying in the vital present moment,\" noting \"just how much fun it is to hear how these veterans try to think in new ways — as they do throughout this engaging release.\"\nExposé Online's  Jon Davis stated: \"Bamako is proof that Free Jazz has many facets, and some of them are quite engaging, and also that harking back to the years on either side of 1970 needn’t be tedious or hackneyed.\"\nWriter Raul Da Gama described the music as \"vivid and edifying, viscerally exciting and truly memorable,\" and, regarding the players, commented: \"Theirs is a music that pokes and probes are the diaphanous fabric of the sonic world, forever looking to penetrate its mysteries.\"\nFilipe Freitas of Jazz Trail stated that the musicians \"all contribute compositions, work dynamics with diligence, and push their personal views into ecstatic realms where nothing feels too soft or too labored... Bamako boasts an excellent and varied repertoire that exalts the genre.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Listen to Dr. Cornel West\" (Joe Fonda) – 14:58\n\"Bamako\" (Graham Haynes) – 6:35\n\"Be Out S'Cool\" (Barry Altschul) – 5:04\n\"Stick\" (Oliver Lake) – 3:25\n\"GS #2\" (Joe Fonda) – 7:28\n\"Just a Simple Song\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:49\n\"Is It Alright?\" (Oliver Lake) – 3:28\n\"3 Phrase 09\" (Oliver Lake) – 5:28\n\"OGJB #2\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) – 6:34\n\"OGJB #1\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) – 4:04\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nOliver Lake – alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, recitation\nGraham Haynes – cornet, dousn' gouni\nJoe Fonda – double bass\nBarry Altschul – drums, percussion, mbira\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rapaza viridis (Latin for 'green grasper') is a species of single-celled flagellate within the Euglenophyceae, a group of algae. It is the only species within the genus Rapaza, family Rapazidae and order Rapazida. It was discovered in a tide pool in British Columbia and described in 2012.\nRapaza viridis is the first known mixotroph (an organism that combines photosynthesis and ingestion of food) and kleptoplastic species within the phylum Euglenozoa. It eats microalgae by engulfing them—a process called phagocytosis—and then uses the chloroplasts from these algae to perform photosynthesis, altering the chloroplasts' structure in the process. In particular, Rapaza viridis can only feed on Tetraselmis cells native to their original environment, and will reject any other prey.\nDue to its unique mode of nutrition and phylogenetic position, Rapaza viridis is considered an evolutionary step between phagotrophs and phototrophs with permanent chloroplasts. Scientists consider that the common ancestor of all Euglenophyceae (a group of algae) was similar to R. viridis. It likely stole chloroplasts from its prey—just like R. viridis—a behavior supported by the discovery of genes in Euglenophyceae that came from different types of algae through a process called horizontal gene transfer. After the divergence of R. viridis, the remaining Euglenophyceae acquired permanent plastids from Pyramimonas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus name Rapaza comes from Latin  rapax 'seizing' and 'grasping', in reference to the feeding behavior of the cells. The specific name viridis, meaning 'green', references the color of the chloroplasts and algal prey cells in the process of being digested. Together, the binomial name means 'green grasper' in Latin.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe genus Rapaza was circumscribed in 2012 by protistologists Aika Yamaguchi, Naoji Yubuki and Brian S. Leander, on a study published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. It was created to describe a population of euglenids isolated in 2010 from marine water samples collected at a tide pool in Pachena Beach, British Columbia, Canada. After cultivation, various growth experiments and molecular phylogenetics, the microorganisms were shown to belong to the phototrophic euglenids (Euglenophyceae) and were described as the species Rapaza viridis. The new species had a functioning chloroplast but also exhibited phagotrophy, making it the first and only example of mixotrophic euglenids.\nThe genus was defined as including flexible mixotrophic euglenids with two unequal flagella, a minimum of one chloroplast with three membranes and pyrenoids penetrated by stacks of thylakoids, a robust stigma, a paraflagellar swelling, and a feeding pocket supported by microtubules. The species was further defined by the length and width measurements of the cells and flagella, the presence of paramylon grains in the cytoplasm, 16 pellicle strips, four rows of microtubules supporting the feeding pocket, and Tetraselmis as its preferred prey.\nIn 2016, American protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith assigned this genus to several monotypic higher-level taxa: family Rapazidae, order Rapazida and subclass Rapazia within the class Euglenophyceae, leaving the remaining euglenophyceans (Euglenales and Eutreptiales) under a new subclass Euglenophycidae. He defined these three taxa as containing phagotrophic photosynthetic eukaryote-eating (eukaryovorous) euglenids that swim in the water column instead of gliding on the substrate, and present four rows of microtubules supporting the feeding pocket instead of one as in Euglenophycidae. His classification scheme was neglected by other authors in favour of treating the entirety of Euglenida (Euglenophyceae plus a variety of heterotrophic flagellates) as a class, and deprecating the use of Rapazia as a subclass. As of 2021, only Rapazidae and Rapazida are accepted taxa.\n\n\n== Biology ==\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nRapaza viridis is a unicellular flagellate, a type of protist that is capable of swimming by using two flagella that differ in length and in movement. The cells are slender with a tapered posterior end, measuring approximately 10–38 μm long and 3–15 μm wide. Both flagella arise from a pocket located at the anterior end of the cell, one twice as long as the other but with the same thickness. The longer flagellum, about 1.25 times the length of the cell, is always directed forward. The shorter flagellum, about 0.65 times the cell length, is directed backward, but sometimes moves forward in an oar-like motion. Like other euglenids, cells are surrounded by a pellicle composed of 16 protein strips arranged helically below the cell membrane, and contain mitochondria with discoidal cristae. As in other spirocutes (i.e. flexible euglenids), cells of R. viridis are capable of 'metaboly' or 'euglenoid movement', which allows for active peristaltic deformation of the cell shape. Its feeding apparatus consists of one rod built of four rows of microtubules and a feeding pocket. There is a stigma composed of 1 to over 10 pigmented particles. The cytoplasm contains ellipsoid paramylon grains, as well as polysaccharide grains as a result of photosynthesis.\n\n\n=== Predation ===\n\nRapaza viridis is an obligate mixotroph that feeds on algae through phagocytosis. In the same sample where the species was discovered, the microorganism consumed native Tetraselmis algae and grew to distinctly larger and brighter cells in their presence, digesting them completely in the course of around 12 hours. When starved from the algae, cells of R. viridis became smaller and colorless, retaining at least one healthy chloroplast within its cytoplasm. During growth experiments, cells of R. viridis were exposed to a variety of different algae (e.g., Navicula, Pycnococcus, Dunaliella, Scrippsiella and non-native strains of Tetraselmis) while starved from the Tetraselmis strain that the species was found with. However, the mixotroph rejected all other preys, and could not survive for longer than 35 days without being exposed to that specific algal strain. Even under constant supply of that strain, the species could not survive for more than a week in the absence of a light source for photosynthesis.\nUpon exposition to the native Tetraselmis strain, R. viridis cells enter a feeding frenzy: they capture algae with the anterior part of the cell and drag the prey, either swimming backward in a spiral pattern or rotating rapidly. The euglenid can gradually peel away the theca (cell covering) of Tetraselmis through repeated peristaltic euglenoid movement (or metaboly), and then engulf the naked prey cell, or engulf the cell with an intact theca and afterwards discharge the theca. The entire process takes between 5 and 40 minutes, but a single R. viridis individual can contain several ingested Tetraselmis cells.\n\n\n=== Chloroplasts and kleptoplasty ===\nWhen describing Rapaza viridis, two types of distinct chloroplasts were reported: one belonging to the ingested green alga Tetraselmis, and one homologous to the chloroplasts seen in phototrophic euglenids. The former were surrounded by two membranes and contained an eyespot and pyrenoids surrounded by starch, without any penetrating thylakoids. The latter were surrounded by three membranes and contained 1–3 pyrenoids, as well as thylakoids in stacks of three that penetrate the pyrenoids. From these observations, it was inferred that R. viridis possesses 'canonical' plastids, i.e. completely functional plastids equivalent to those seen in other Euglenophyceae, which depend on the host cell for survival and multiply and evolve with it.\nHowever, subsequent studies revealed that R. viridis does not have canonical plastids. Instead, it extracts and temporarily retains the chloroplasts of its prey for its own use, a process known as kleptoplasty ('stealing of plastids'). After phagocytosis of the algal prey, its cell membrane is digested and the plastids are separated from the other cellular components, which are later excreted from the host cell. Then, the stolen plastids ('kleptoplasts') are transformed until they resemble canonical plastids: they are divided into smaller fragments by fission, the green algal pyrenoid surrounded by starch disappears, smaller pyrenoids penetrated by thylakoids are formed, the starch grains gradually disappear, and a three-membrane envelope is displayed (two membranes from the original chloroplast and one membrane belonging to the food vacuole).\nRapaza viridis needs a regular influx of kleptoplasts, obtained through the phagocytosis of its prey. Without acquiring new kleptoplasts, the cells cannot survive for more than 35 days. During starvation, the remaining kleptoplasts are gradually degraded, and vacuoles are formed to recycle intracellular substances.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe species Rapaza viridis was reported in a tide pool in Pachena Beach, British Columbia. Because of this location, it is considered a marine species. In addition, the TARA Oceans expedition and Ocean Sampling Day campaign recovered an enormous diversity of environmental sequences that belong to or are most closely related to Rapaza, particularly within the Mediterranean Sea. These sequences, named Rapaza-like operational taxonomic unit (OTUs), were more abundant in waters with high temperatures (20–30°C).\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nAccording to phylogenetic analyses, Rapaza viridis is the sister group to all other Euglenophyceae. This phylogenetic position is consistent with its place as an evolutionary step between the completely phagotrophic peranemids and the phototrophic Euglenophyceae, because mixotrophy is considered the transitional state during the establishment of the endosymbiotic prey cell and the phagotrophic host cell. It is also consistent with other intermediate characters. For example, it is the only eukaryote-eating euglenid that, instead of gliding on the substrate, is capable of swimming in the water column, a pattern only seen in phototrophs. It is also the only euglenophycean that only presents the MAT paralogue of the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase, found in heterotrophic euglenids, whereas the remaining euglenophyceans acquired the MATX paralogue after the split from Rapaza.\n\nRapaza viridis is the first case of kleptoplasty within Euglenozoa. Particularly, its chloroplasts are obtained from the green alga Tetraselmis. Transcriptomic and genomic analyses revealed that there are genes encoded in the nucleus of R. viridis and other Euglenophyceae for plastid-targeted proteins acquired from chloroplasts of many different algae (including algae from the \"red lineage\", i.e. red and chromalveolate algae) through multiple ancient events of horizontal gene transfer. Due to these discoveries, the leading hypothesis is that the last common ancestor of all Euglenophyceae was not a phototroph, but an alga-eating phagotroph without permanent plastids that could have exhibited kleptoplasty, much like Rapaza viridis. This common ancestor horizontally acquired the protein targeting system from many algae after prolonged coexistence (from both kleptoplasty and predation). This targeting system could have been involved in the establishment of permanent plastids in the remaining Euglenophyceae, which originated from the green alga Pyramimonas. Additionally, Tetraselmis-derived genes are abundant in other Euglenophyceae, while Pyramimonas-derived genes are minor in Rapaza, meaning that the close association with Pyramimonas began after the divergence of Rapaza.\nIn addition to kleptoplast-targeted proteins, Rapaza viridis obtained a nucleus-coded nitrate reductase through horizontal gene transfer from ancient algal prey. Nitrate reductases are a key component of phototrophic organisms, since it allows for the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen, which heterotrophic organisms are not capable of. This enzyme, known as RvNaRL, is a crucial step of metabolic integration in the early stages of secondary endosymbiosis towards permanent phototrophy.\n\n\n== References ==",

However, Ukrainian electoral law does not allow, nor does it have any mechanisms for postal or early voting, which complicates voting for people in countries without embassies or consulates, resulting in low turnout each election. Both the government and political parties usually ignore and neglect overseas voters, with the latter refusing to campaign and mobilize diaspora. Still, pro-European and nationalist forces usually overperform in the expatriate voting, compared to nationwide overall results.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Results per polling stations/embassies ==\nIn 2012, the foreign electoral district was composed of 117 polling stations in 77 countries, however, some polling stations have been a home for voters from multiple countries, e.g. the Embassy of Ukraine to Singapore, where Ukrainians living in Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei could vote.\nBelow is the result of the election in the numerical order of the polling stations, with some countries' stations, like Italy, which has three separate ones, combined into a single result table.\n\n\n=== Polling station in Canberra ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Vienna ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Baku ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Algiers ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Buenos Aires ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Brussels ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Minsk and Brest ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Sofia ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Brasília ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Hanoi ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in London and Edinburgh ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Yerevan ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Athens and Thessaloniki ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Tbilisi and Batumi ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Copenhagen ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tallinn ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Cairo ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Tel Aviv and Haifa ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in New Delhi ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tehran ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Dublin ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Madrid, Barcelona and Málaga ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Rome, Milan and Naples ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Amman ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Astana and Almaty ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Ottawa and Toronto ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Nairobi ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Bishkek ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Beijing and Shanghai ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Nicosia ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Seoul ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Havana ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Kuwait City ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Riga ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Vilnius ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Beirut ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tripoli ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Skopje ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Kuala Lumpur ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Rabat ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Mexico City ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Chișinău and Bălți ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Abuja ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in The Hague ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Berlin, Bohn, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Oslo ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Abu Dhabi and Dubai ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Islamabad ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Lima ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Pretoria ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Warsaw, Gdańsk, Kraków and Lublin ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Lisbon and Porto ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Bucharest and Suceava ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Riyadh ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Belgrade and Sojevo ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Singapore ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Bratislava and Prešov ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Ljubljana ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Chicago ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Bangkok ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tunis ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Ankara and Istanbul ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Ashgabat ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Budapest and Nyíregyháza ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tashkent ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Helsinki ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Paris and Marseille ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Zagreb ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Prague and Brno ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Podgorica ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Bern ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Stockholm ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Tokyo ===\n\n\n=== Polling stations in Goma and Bunia ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Monrovia ===\n\n\n=== Polling station in Dakar ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Punch Bowl is a historic pub in Burton in Lonsdale, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe building was constructed as a coaching inn in the 18th century, and extended in the 19th century.  In the early 20th century, its stables were converted, to enlarge the public areas.  As the village grew, with a pottery industry, it had at its peak 13 pubs, but with the decline of the industry, they closed, leaving only the Punch Bowl.  The building was grade II listed in 1958 and altered in the 1970s.  In 2014, Thwaites Brewery sold the pub, at which time it was listed as an asset of community value.  The pub became a free house, but was again put up for sale in 2024, with an asking price of £315,000.  A group of villagers formed an organisation to explore bringing it into community ownership.\nThe two-storey pub is built of limewashed stone, with painted stone dressings, and a slate roof.  The original part has three bays, a central doorway with a moulded hood, and mullioned windows containing casements and fixed lights.  In the 19th-century extension, to the left, are a doorway and two windows.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burton in Lonsdale\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBolton in Lonsdale Community Inn",

        "content": "Otis Clapp & Son (today branded simply as \"Otis Clapp\") is an American pharmaceutical manufacturer which has been owned by Medique since 2008. Prior to its acquisition by Medique, was an independent company for a 168 year history, making it one of the United States' longest-operating pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nOtis Clapp & Son was founded in 1840 by Otis Clapp as a homeopathic-focused pharmacy. The pharmacy grew into a sizable operation as homeopathics grew in popularity in the New England region. It expanded its operations further in the 1870s after Clapp's son, James Wilkinson Clapp, became a partner and it assumed the name \"Otis Clapp & Son\". By the 1890s, the company had expanded its operations, including  into the manufacture of medical equipment such as x-ray machines. In the 1990s, it began to narrow its operations by focusing on the manufacture pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1840, publisher and bookseller Otis Clapp opened a pharmacy focused on homeopathics in the Back Bay of Boston, Massachusetts. At the time it opened, the city had only three or four homeopathic physicians. The pharmacy is considered to have been the United States' second-established homeopathic pharmacy, and the first in the New England region. Initially, its inventory was limited, however as homeopathy grew more popular in New England so too did the pharmacy. To grow, it moved the location of its storefront in both 1841 and 1855. It became one of the world's largest homeopathic pharmacies, and was well-known and long-operating. Otis Clapp manufactured and marketed his own homeopathic medicines.\nIn the 1870s, his son joined as a business partner of the operation, which was renamed \"Otis Clapp & Son\" in 1874. The younger Dr. Clapp was a research scientist, businessman, and professor of pharmacy at the Boston University Medical School. He had previously worked in his father's store beginning at fourteen years of age. A few years after the father and the son became partners, the company's storefront again moved., and a second store was opened after that. In the 1880s, the pharmacy established a second location in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe operation expanded its business to include the sale of laboratory equipment; such equipment for medicine and bacteriology. By the 1890s, the company was manufacturing x-ray machines. In 1912, the company built a new headquarters in Boston. The company long remained under the Clapp family's ownership.\nIn the mid-20th century, the company innovated in the production of medicine dispensing equipment.\nIn the late 1990s, the company began specializing in the manufacture of over-the-counter drugs, marketing especially to sell their products to be sold by employers for use in workplaces.\nIn 2008, the company (by then known as Otis Clapp and Buffington) was acquired by Medique Inc. It was, by that time, one of the oldest operating pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United States. Products continue to be sold by Medique under the \"Otis Clapp\" brand name.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The protest was a part of pro-Palestine protests on university campuses campaigning for divestment from Israel. USC cancelled their main commencement ceremony over safety concerns about protests. The encampment was cleared by the Los Angeles Police Department on the morning of May 5.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEarlier in the month on April 17, protesters as Columbia University began an occupation protest on its campus to protest the university's investments in Israel amid the Israel–Hamas war. The protest, as well as the police response, sparked nationwide protests at university campuses.\nOn April 15, USC announced they would cancel the upcoming commencement speech by pro-Palestinian valedictorian Asna Tabassum, citing security concerns. Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Andrew T. Guzman stated the decision came after debate over Tabassum being chosen to give the speech took on an \"alarming tenor\", saying it would have posed a security risk. The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the speech's cancellation. Days later the school also cancelled the planned commencement speech by director Jon M. Chu, as well as the planned granting of honorary degrees to Billie Jean King, Maria Rosario Jackson, and Marcia McNutt.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== April 24 ===\nThe encampment was set up at Alumni Park on April 24. Officers from the USC Police and the Los Angeles Police Department arrested 93 people on the first night of the protest. In addition, USC closed off campus to the general public.\n\n\n=== April 25 ===\nUSC announced they would cancel their main graduation ceremony. The university later announced they would hold a \"Trojan Family\" event for graduates at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event was set for May 9, a day before when the graduation was scheduled.\n\n\n=== May 5 ===\nAround a hundred LAPD officers raided and cleared the encampment at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 5. No arrests were made.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Israel–Hamas war protests on university campuses in the United States\n2024 University of California, Los Angeles pro-Palestinian campus occupation\nBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions\nStudent protest\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Racibórz Castle is a stronghold mentioned in Gesta principum Polonorum of Gallus Anonymus in an entry dated to the year 1108. The first brick sections were likely built around the mid-13th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is speculated that the first mention of the Racibórz stronghold dates back to around 845 in a text known as the Bavarian Geographer. It mentions the Golensizi tribe inhabiting the Upper Oder Basin, which had five strongholds. Based on research, it is presumed that one of these strongholds was Racibórz. It is also assumed that it could have been Eburium, the legendary capital of the Quadi. The Latin work Commentarius belli adversum Turcas ad Viennam... by Wespazjan Kochowski, which discusses John III Sobieski's expedition to Vienna, describes the 24th of August, the day when the king arrived at the Racibórz Castle, as follows:From Tarnowskie Góry through Gliwice and Rudy, marching along the road amidst forests to Racibórz, where once was the capital of the Quadi, and later the seat of Polish princes of royal blood, where after passing through, heavy troops were left under the care of Hetman Jabłonowski, and the king, along with a strong army, swiftly entered Austrian territory.Wespazjan Kochowski also mentions Racibórz in the poem Dzieło Boskie albo Pieśni Wiednia wybawionego published in 1684, where in chapter XLVII one can read:Here [in Tarnowskie Góry] briefly pausing, he [the king] moved where the Quadi once had their capital in Racibórz, from there through the Moravian mountains leading into the land of the Marcomanni, further to Olomouc (...)F.A. Larisch, a German regionalist, believed that Claudius Ptolemy mentioned Racibórz. Władysław K. Zieliński also mentions this in his work Szląsk (pruski) słowem i ołówkiem na podstawie najnowszych źródeł przedstawiony published in 1889:According to Count Larisch, Racibórz was already known as Eburium under Ptolemy, as the capital of the Buri of the tribe of the Suevi [which was the name for the Quadi who invaded Italy and Spain]. This name was probably transformed by the later Slavic inhabitants into Hrad-Ebur or Hrad-Ibur, from which the present name Racibórz (Hrad-Rad-Rac-ibor) originated.\n\n\n=== From 11th to 12th century ===\nAround the year 1000, there was supposed to be a border fortress in Racibórz. Around 1038, the Racibórz fortress, like the entire Silesia, fell under Czech rule. The Racibórz Castle is first mentioned in Gesta principum Polonorum of Gallus Anonymus in an entry dated 1108. At that time, there was a border castle here. According to the information contained there, the stronghold belonged to the Moravians, and the knights of Bolesław III Wrymouth entered it without a fight, having previously defeated Moravian knights who set out from the stronghold. Racibórz was then a very important stronghold in the defensive system of the Polish-Czech border, so its establishment can be associated with the construction of border fortresses during the conflict between the Piasts and the Premyslids (11th–12th century), rather than with the Golensyts tribe. According to Gallus Anonymus:When Bolesław was guarding the country and striving with all his might for the glory of the homeland, it so happened that the Moravians appeared, wanting to preoccupy the Koźle stronghold in secret from the Poles. At that time, Bolesław sent certain noble knights to occupy, if possible, Racibórz, but he himself did not give up hunting and rest for this reason. These noble knights went away and fought with the Moravians, in which several noble Poles fell in battle, but their comrades took possession of the field of victory and the stronghold. Thus, the Moravians were defeated in battle, and those in the stronghold, unaware of anything, were captured.From 1108 to the beginning of the 14th century, the castle was under the rule of the Piasts. Until the first half of the 14th century, a castellan resided here, and from the end of the 14th century until 1743, it was also the seat of the Racibórz district starosta. From 1172, the castle was also a princely residence. During the reign of Bolesław III Wrymouth, the fortress was one of the important strongholds defending the southern border of the Polish state. Karol Maleczyński dates the founding of the stronghold to the second half of the 10th century, which was corroborated by archaeological research conducted in the castle courtyard. This location was not chosen randomly, as it utilized the natural bend of the Oder river, which was cut off by a river branch to create an island, later called the Racibórz Island. One could get to it via a levee, which is now the route of Zamkowa Street. In 1146, Władysław II the Exile resided at the Racibórz Castle, who was expelled by his brothers. In 1172, Mieszko IV Tanglefoot chose Racibórz as the capital of his principality. His brother, Bolesław I the Tall received Lower Silesia and Opole, while Mieszko received the principality of Racibórz after their father, Władysław II the Exile. During his reign, Racibórz Castle flourished. In 1689, Fryderyk Lucae, a Silesian chronicler, mentions the ruler:There is also the ancient princely castle, which the supreme Polish prince Mieszko [Tanglefoot] built with his wife in 1177, out of concern for his subjects, which stands firmly above the Oder and shines more with ancient monuments than with elegance.\n\n\n=== From 13th to 15th century ===\nDuring the reign of Mieszko IV Tanglefoot, a mint producing bracteates with the inscription MILOST (meaning honor or respect) has been operating in the castle since around 1200. This inscription was one of the earliest examples of the Polish language on coins. However, Borys Paszkiewicz argues that this bracteate is a Lower Silesian coin, and the inscription MILOST may have Czech origins. During Mieszko's rule, a Romanesque castle chapel was also built, which was probably the oldest place of spreading the Christian faith in the Racibórz land. In 1201, as a result of the death of his brother and his son Jarosław, Mieszko took over Opole, creating the Opole-Racibórz Duchy. Racibórz was then the seat of the duchy's court, as indicated by the ruler's title (dux Ratibor, dux Raceburgensis).\nIn 1211, after the death of Tanglefoot, his son Casimir I took over power in the castle, and during his reign, Opole gained significance, becoming the capital of the duchy. Before 1217, the duke established the left-bank part of Racibórz under Flemish law. After Casimir's death, the regents ruled the duchy, first Henry the Bearded, then the widow of Prince Casimir, Duchess Wiola. In 1222, the Racibórz castellan – Stoigniew – took over. Around 1238, the underage Mieszko became the lord of the Opole-Racibórz Duchy, who resided more often in Racibórz, as indicated by the number of documents issued in this city. Sources indicate a strong fortification of the stronghold, surrounded by a wooden-earth rampart, additionally bordered by the Oder river from the south and its branches from the other sides. The stronghold's fortification is evidenced by the repulsion of the Mongol attack in January 1241. This event is associated with the Racibórz legend of the Mongol leader Tin-fu. According to legend, the alleged castellan, Bartek Lasota, along with a company of warriors, confronted a larger Tatar horde. One of the warriors fatally wounded the Mongolian leader in the throat with an arrow shot from the castle, which contributed to the fleeing besieging troops. To commemorate this event, Mieszko II the Fat commissioned the carving of the Mongolian leader's head in stone, which until World War II was located at the corner, in the southeast wing of the castle, and now is in the Racibórz Museum. In 1246, the lord of the duchy became Duke Vladislaus I, who also resided more often in the Racibórz Castle. In 1249, the Racibórz stronghold was besieged by the troops of the Olomouc bishop, Bruno von Schauenburg. It was a retaliation for Vladislaus' earlier raid on the Opava land. Attempts to capture the stronghold failed, but the troops burned the city, and Vladislaus had to pay 3,000 silver coins.\n\nAfter the death of Duke Vladislaus (1281/1282), the castle fell to his youngest son Przemysław. During his time, the castle was rebuilt, and brick buildings were erected, including the castle chapel. From 1285 to 1287, the Wrocław bishop, Tomasz II, resided in the Racibórz stronghold, and got into conflict with the Wrocław duke Henry Probus. In 1288, Tomasz II founded a collegiate chapter at the castle chapel, which was an expression of gratitude for the hospitality shown. This event was described by Jan Długosz in the Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland:Having gathered a great army consisting of both his own soldiers and mercenaries hired for a monetary contribution, which he exacted as a punishment from the Wrocław church, he militarily invaded the lands of Duke Casimir of Opole and besieged the city of Racibórz due to the presence of Wrocław bishop Tomasz and his clergy therein. Although the wealthier citizens of Racibórz endured the siege for some time and pledged to endure it even longer, the surprised populace, feeling scarcity and lack of food, tormented by hunger, cried constantly, lamented loudly, and sighed, hurling curses and insults at Bishop Tomasz and his clergy. Moved by this, Bishop Tomasz, known for his great kindness, which he allegedly always displayed, said: \"Rather let me and my clergy fall into the hands of the tyrant than these innocents perish from hunger. We will immediately free from danger those people who, besieged, are dying from fear and hunger. Let us ward off the destruction threatening this city, which has nourished us and provided us shelter for a long time, either by our imprisonment or – if it pleases God – by our death. Then he put on his liturgical garments and ordered some of the clergy to do the same. And so, in his liturgical vestments and with episcopal insignia, he left the city with all his clergy in exile and proceeded to the tyrant's camp to appease his wrath with the greatest humility. (...) The tyrant, who saw him coming from afar, by the grace of God, was seized with such great fear that he rushed out of his tent as quickly as possible to meet the bishop, fell face down on the ground, and as if seeing something divine in the bishop and revering him as the Eternal Shepherd, begged for forgiveness for his sins. Bishop Tomasz, raising him from the ground, with tears promised to forgive him all his faithlessness, provided that he persevered in this contrition and piety. And after mutual tearful embraces and kisses, the duke and the bishop entered the nearest church of St. Nicholas without witnesses.At the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, the fortress was rebuilt into a Gothic-style castle. It was also during this time that the wooden palisade on the ramparts was replaced by a wall with fortified towers. According to archaeological research, the first brick buildings can be dated to the second half of the 13th century. Around 1290, Duke Przemysław of Racibórz commissioned the construction of a Gothic chapel, which was dedicated to St. Thomas Becket. The period of prosperity of the castle coincided with the reign of Duke Przemysław and his son Leszek. The building was surrounded by a settlement of fishermen, millers, and craftsmen, which became the nucleus of the later community of Ostróg. In 1306, when Duke Przemysław died, a physician, Magister Jan, was mentioned at the court. After the death of Duke Przemysław, Leszek of Racibórz became the ruler of the separated Racibórz district.\nAfter the death of Duke Leszek in 1336, the castle passed into the hands of the Opava Přemyslids, namely Nicholas II. This happened because Leszek in 1327 pledged homage to John of Bohemia. Moreover, the duke and his wife Agnieszka, daughter of Henry IV the Faithful, had no children, and the Racibórz Piast line ended with them. These factors, along with the support of the Racibórz patriciate, contributed to the takeover of the duchy by the Přemyslids, who mainly resided in Opava. After the abolition of the office of castellan, the castle was inhabited by the castle commander, referred to in Latin sources as procurator, flodarius, or occasionally wlodarius castri Rathiboriensis. Sources mentioned two Racibórz castle commanders. The first was Jeszko, mentioned in 1305, and the second was Leks or Leksza, appearing in documents from 1317, 1337, and 1343. It cannot be conclusively stated whether the office was abolished after 1343, but it is a fact that no more castle commanders appear in the sources. From 1383 onwards (or shortly before that date), a district starosta resided in the castle, who was in charge of the Racibórz Castle district. This position existed until 1743. During the rule of the Přemyslids, Racibórz lost its significance, and the boundaries of the duchy significantly shrank. In 1416, the collegiate church was transferred to the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Racibórz.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\nFrom the 16th century, the stronghold was owned by the King of Bohemia, and then by noble families. In 1521, after the death of the Duke of Opava, Valentine, known as the Hunchback, the rule of the castle was taken over by the Duke of Opole, Jan II the Good. In 1532, after the death of Duke Jan II, Racibórz passed into the hands of the Czech King Ferdinand I. In the same year, the existence of a brewery at the castle was mentioned. Shortly thereafter, it fell into the hands of Margrave George the Pious as collateral for debts amounting to 200,000 guilders owed to the Prague court. Between 1532 and 1533, George renovated the destroyed castle buildings. The profits from the Racibórz estate were used to build a castle in Roth near Nuremberg, which is now called Ratibor. The margrave spread Lutheranism in the Duchy of Racibórz during this time. After repaying the debt to the Hohenzollerns, the castle returned to the possession of the Habsburgs, who entrusted the Duchy of Racibórz to various families. The first owner of the stronghold was Isabella Jagiellon, the daughter of Sigismund I the Old and Bona Sforza. She received the Opole-Racibórz Duchy from Emperor Ferdinand I after relinquishing her rights to the Hungarian crown. In 1556, she renounced her Silesian estates and returned to Hungary.In 1556, [Isabella] returned to her homeland, the duchies again fell to Emperor Ferdinand I, who managed them through provincial governors. The property of the Racibórz chamber was managed by the imperial councilor and starosta of our duchy, George von Oppersdorff, first on account, later as a pledge for a certain sum loaned to the emperor.The ownership relations of the castle, along with the rights associated with them and the affiliated lands, were very complex, as evidenced by the fact that from 1532 to 1645, the Opole-Racibórz Duchy had a total of eight rulers. From 1558, the duchy was subordinated to the emperors, and the castle was managed by individuals who received it as a pledge or were only its administrators. From 1564, the Oppersdorffs received the castle from the emperor as collateral for a loan of 60,000 guilders at 6% annually. The duchy then included over 20 villages, and the castle's starosta had an annual income of 3,705 thalers, mainly from folwarks located in Ocice and Miedonia. The only obligation of the count was to maintain the castle guard, his horses, castle servants, including cooks and bakers, and the staff at the folwarks. At that time, the priest received 8 loaves of bread and 8 quarts of beer. The city of Racibórz made efforts to take over the castle estates from Count Oppersdorff and offered the emperor a larger sum of money. As a result of subsequent negotiations, the city was to have the castle estates pledged for another 24 years. In 1574, a fire broke out in the city, which severely damaged it, making it impossible to fulfill its obligations to the emperor. In 1575, the castle estates were taken over by creditors, mainly feudal lords. As compensation for the money paid by the city, the emperor granted it a portion of the Studzienna village. On 22 August 1587, a double election was held for the Polish throne, and one of the elected was Archduke Maximilian II, who stopped and stayed at the Racibórz stronghold on his way to Kraków. An urbarium from 1595 describes the castle as follows:The castle is surrounded by the Oder, and one of its arms goes towards the sawmill and the castle mill. (...) [The castle] is surrounded by a low wall, which, however, disappeared from the Oder side. At the entrance, there is a gate building and a wooden chamber, and next to it, the old entrance to the castle. Right next to it stands a church with a dressing room sacristy, which, however, threatens to collapse, below it are chambers and an attic. Below the church is a vaulted room and a prison. In addition, one cellar for wine and two vaulted ones for beer, behind them a kitchen pantry and one vaulted cellar. Above the cellar are stairs, a stable, to the right one room, two vaulted rooms, and one bedroom, to the left a large room where court sessions take place, one vaulted room, one small chamber, and a small bedroom. On the upper floor, there is one larger hall, one room, and a bedroom, opposite a cell. The roof is still good, and under it are three empty rooms and an armory. Behind it is a building with a clock, opposite a warehouse, a large kitchen, next to it an alcove, a room, a hall, below a large stable. On the third side, a vaulted bakery and a vestibule, next to two stables, above a room and an alcove and a large attic. Again, an old room and a wooden alcove next to old walls with two warehouses. Everything is covered with shingles. Guards can walk around the castle, but the walls are damaged in many places.The above urbarium indicates that the castle estate at the time included 26 nearby villages, which were given as pledges.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\n\nIn 1603, 11 villages were sold as hereditary property to various individuals. In 1604, the Duchy of Racibórz, including the castle, came into the hands of the barons Baltazar and Jerzy von Mettich as a pledge for the sum of 116,000 thalers. They rebuilt the castle, and the cost of the work was estimated at 6,000 thalers. In 1609, after paying an additional 28,000 thalers, the castle became the property of the von Mettich barons. In addition to the castle, the Mettich family received sawmills, mills, separate buildings, and various rights. Their estate also included 3 folwarks and 15 villages. At that time, the building was in ruins, and the baron undertook to restore the chapel and not to limit the endowments for the priests who conducted services there. Chasubles, chalices, and monstrances belonging to the castle collegiate church were listed and, according to the chamber records, were to be returned to the Church. In the early 17th century, the castle underwent reconstruction, resulting in the baroque appearance of the chapel facade.\nSubsequent owners of the castle included George Frederick, Jan Zygmunt Batory, and, as a result of the Thirty Years' War, from 1622, Gabriel Bethlen, the Prince of Transylvania. In 1628, these properties were acquired by Emperor Ferdinand II for the sum of 130,000 guilders. However, the imperial chamber took possession of these lands only in 1631 due to difficulties in determining the boundaries of the duchy. In 1637, a fire broke out at the castle, and Italian masters were hired for its reconstruction, and they also built the castle in Głogówek. As a result of the work carried out at the castle, the northeast wing was rebuilt, enriched with an arcaded cloister and a loggia on the upper floor. Additionally, the southeast wing was expanded, where a restaurant was located in the second half of the 19th century. The gate tower also acquired a baroque appearance. From 1642, the castle returned to the hands of the Oppersdorf family, specifically to Count George III. These properties were transferred due to the settlement of debts, as Countess von Oppersdorff lent almost 62,000 thalers to Prince von Lichtenstein and 45,000 thalers to the emperor. Additionally, the Oppersdorffs undertook to pay 130,000 thalers within the next three years to take over the duchy as their own. At that time, the estate included the castle and 21 surrounding villages, which had 10 free farms, 21 free peasants, 70 free cottagers, 23 free cottages, 204 serf farmers, and 121 serf peasants. The duchy generated an annual net profit of 18,378 guilders.\nIn 1645, the Duchy of Racibórz, along with the castle, was pawned to the House of Vasa. In March 1656, King of Poland John II Casimir Vasa appointed Count Franciszek Euzebiusz von Oppersdorff as the governor of the Duchy of Racibórz and Opole. This was a kind of gratitude for the shelter provided by the count to the king and his wife during the Swedish Deluge. In 1666, the Duchy of Racibórz returned to Austria, but Count von Oppersdorff remained its governor until his death in 1691. Subsequent owners included families such as Sobeck, Schlabrendorff, Wlczek, and Reuss von Plauen.\nIn 1670, the castle and town were visited by Empress Eleonora Gonzaga, who was traveling to Częstochowa for the wedding of her daughter to the King of Poland Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki. The passage through Silesian lands was supervised by Prince Christian of Brzeg, appointed by Count Franciszek Euzebiusz von Oppersdorff, starosta of the Duchy of Racibórz. Upon arrival, the empress was greeted with a variety of provisions, including 20 oxen, 60 calves, 30 rams, 11 lambs, 12 pigs, venison, 20 buckets of Austrian wine and 14 buckets of Hungarian wine. The list of confectionery products alone was 4 pages long. Count Oppersdorff notified the magistrate that the empress and her entourage would also stay in the city on their way back, this time in three buildings between Panieńska and Rzeźnicza streets.\n\nOn 24 August 1683, the castle, owned by Franciszek Euzebiusz Oppersdorff, hosted John III Sobieski, who was heading to Vienna. The king's army consisted of 20 light banners, several hundred dragoons, and many officers, totaling 3,000 men. Sobieski even mentioned his stay in Racibórz in his letters to Marie Casimire Sobieska:The people here are incredibly kind and bless us, and the land is wonderfully cheerful. (...) Yesterday we were at Count Oppersdorf's castle in Racibórz, but he did not deign to entertain us, only from the imperial chamber. Countess herself brought at least thirty ladies, who sat at the table with us; although she is the younger sister of our lady-in-waiting, she seems to be her mother. A very polite blonde, both in speech and gestures, wonderfully resembling our lady-in-waiting. She has two or three daughters: the eldest married to Mr. von Prazmo, lively and quarrelsome with her husband; the younger, a maiden, charming, similar to the marshal's wife. We played cards before dinner, some older and uglier lady beat me.Franciszek Euzebiusz Oppersdorff did not want to offend the emperor, so the feast with which he entertained the Polish king was financed with the emperor's money. Before the meal, everyone played Ombre. John III Sobieski did not spend the night at the castle but returned to his camp between Pietrowice Wielkie and Pietraszyn. From 2 AM to 8 PM, the townspeople watched the troops march over the bridge on the Odra river.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nAfter the Oppersdorfs ceased to be the owners of the castle, it passed from hand to hand. The new owners neglected the castle, causing it to deteriorate. In 1712, Franciszek Euzebiusz II von Oppersdorf put Racibórz Castle and its adjacent estates up for sale due to the lack of an heir and the need to make large payments to his sisters. Baron Karol Henryk von Sobeck and Rauthen, the lord of Koszęcin, purchased these estates for the sum of 134,000 thalers. In 1738, the castle passed into the ownership of his son, Karol von Sobeck, who died in 1743. When King Frederick the Great visited Racibórz in June 1742, he stayed at the convent of the Holy Sepulchre in the New Town, which could suggest the poor condition of the building since the king did not choose the castle as his residence.\nAfter Karol's death, the owner of Racibórz Castle was his brother Feliks, and then his son, Jan Nepomucen, who sold these estates in 1776 for 355,000 thalers. They were acquired by Count Ludwik Fryderyk von Schlabrendorf, who, for speculative purposes, also acquired many other Silesian properties. He caused the oak forests belonging to his estates to be cut down, and the timber obtained was sold at high prices to England and France. In 1780, the castle was purchased by Maciej von Wilczek and his wife, Dorota, for 565,000 guilders. However, they were briefly the owners of the estate, and in 1788, they sold it to Count Henryk XLIII Reuß.\nThe count also did not stay long at Racibórz Castle and sold it to the Prussian state treasury in 1791. In 1799, the Prussian treasury exchanged Racibórz Castle for the Koźle Fortress, which belonged to Count von Plettenberg-Wittem. This exchange was profitable for the count, as the value of the fortress in Koźle was estimated at 400,000 thalers, while that of Racibórz Castle was 600,000 thalers. Shortly thereafter, the count transformed the acquired property into a fief.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nCount von Plettenberg-Wittem ruled Racibórz Castle until 1805, when it was taken over by the Prussian minister and chamberlain Wilhelm Ludwig Georg, Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein. During the Napoleonic Wars, a field hospital for French soldiers was set up in the castle. Sources indicate that between February and May 1808, six soldiers died there. According to findings, the prince was merely the nominal owner of the Racibórz estates, and the entire property was to be transferred to the Elector von Hesse-Kassel. This action was prompted by the fact that the Protestant Kingdom of Prussia did not want to enter into an agreement with the Catholic Prince of Hesse-Kassel. Therefore, the role of intermediary was assumed by the Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein.\nOn 1 July 1812, the estate passed into the hands of the Elector Prince for 627,751 thalers. On 6 June 1817, thanks to the efforts of the prince, the estate, which had been a fief, became a sovereign duchy, free from dues. In 1819, the sovereign duchy comprised 65 villages and 30 farms located in the districts of Głubczyce, Koźle, Racibórz, Rybnik, and Toszek-Gliwice. The area was inhabited by 696 peasants, 713 smallholders, and 1,818 cottagers, totaling 18,720 inhabitants. The Prince of Hesse-Kassel visited Racibórz Castle only once, on 3 July 1819. However, he stayed in the city rather than at the castle, as it was in poor condition. The prince received an annual income of 55,000 thalers from the Racibórz estate.\nIn 1820, the ruler of the principality became Landgrave Victor Amadeus von Hessen-Rothenburg. This happened because Hesse ceded part of its territory to the Kingdom of Prussia, and the landgrave consequently lost his possessions. As partial compensation, he was given the Duchy of Racibórz. On 2 September 1820, Victor Amadeus von Hessen-Rothenburg and his wife, Eliza, née Princess zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg, appeared in Racibórz. The new owners of the castle were hospitably received by the city authorities, who granted them honorary citizenship. On September 27, the landgrave established a chamber to manage his Upper Silesian estates. On 9 June 1821, he received an edict from King Frederick William III of Prussia, elevating the Racibórz estates to the status of a mediate duchy (German: Mediatherzogtum), with the right to a separate vote in the Silesian Landtag. Victor Amadeus von Hessen-Rothenburg decided to reside in Racibórz. However, since the castle was not suitable as a noble residence, he adapted the Cistercian monastery in Rudy as his residence.\nIn 1834, the landgrave died without heirs. According to his will, the Duchy of Racibórz and Corvey (which he also received in 1820), as well as the Sośnica and Zębowice estates, were inherited by his wife's nephew, Victor Maurice von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst. The landgrave's second nephew, Clodwig Charles Victor, received the Treffurt estates and specified income from the Corvey principality. Thus, from the 1830s until 1945, the castle remained in the hands of the Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst family, who had their residence in nearby Rudy. The castle was inhabited by officials, and the dukes decided to build the Chamber of Racibórz next to it. Established in 1820, the office was tasked with managing the castle estates. The project, drawn up by building inspector Linke, envisaged the building to be erected on the northern side of the present-day Zamkowa Street. In 1840, Victor Maurice von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst was granted the title of Herzog von Ratibor by the emperor. From then on, he styled himself Herzog von Ratibor, Fürst von Corvey, Prinz zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst – Durchlaucht. In 1846, a two-story building for the ducal chamber was put into use. In addition to office space, the building also contained several apartments. The first chamber steward was Justice Counselor Frederick Wilhelm Lange, who was replaced by Justice Counselor and retired cavalry captain Gustav Adolf von Wiese-Kaiserswaldau after Lange's death in 1853.\nOn 19 January 1858, another fire destroyed the wing parallel to the Oder river. The fire, noticed around 1:00 PM in the brewery, quickly spread to other buildings covered with shingles. The destroyed southern wing was dismantled. A new brewery building was erected in place of the northern and partially western wings. On 10 June 1858, the cornerstone was laid for the new building. The layout of the rooms in the western part was changed, and the economic building became a malt house. The northwest part was enriched with a carriage house. The chapel regained its Gothic facade and was enriched with, among other things, a painting depicting St. Thomas Becket. The entire reconstruction was overseen by Julius Starcke and master carpenter Robert Raschdorf. On 8 October 1859, the brewery was put into operation.\nIn 1871, during the Prussian administrative reform, the manorial area (German: Gutsbezirke) of Ostróg was created, which also included the castle. In 1893, at the age of 46, after the death of Prince Victor, his son Viktor Amadeus II von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst became the owner of the castle.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1902, the name of the manorial area of Ostróg was changed to the manorial area of Racibórz-Castle. On 5 January 1927, the manorial area of Racibórz-Castle was incorporated into Racibórz and ceased to function as an independent administrative division. In 1923, after the death of Prince Viktor II, the owner of the castle became Victor August Maria III. The successor to Prince Victor III was killed in 1939 during the September Campaign in the Battle of Modlin. Victor III died on 11 November 1945, and his successor was Franz-Albrecht Metternich-Sándor, who, however, did not inherit the Racibórz Castle as it became the property of the Polish state.\nUntil 1945, the castle housed princely officials. During World War II, the castle buildings did not suffer any damage. Since 1945, the castle has been owned by the State Treasury under the administration of the Racibórz County. Initially, after the war, an archive was located here, apartments were situated in part of the princely palace, and beer production was resumed in the brewery. From the 1950s onwards, there was a gradual degradation of the buildings. The residential building in the southeast part was demolished because it was damaged in a fire. The altar, organ, and benches in the chapel were devastated and destroyed. In the collection of the Racibórz Museum, there is a painting of St. Thomas Becket by Jan Bochenek and statues of the Apostles, which originally were in the sedilia. In the following years, the carriage house building and cloisters were demolished, and the rooms of the castle house suffered further damage. In the 1960s, archaeological research was conducted, confirming the existence of wooden structures from the 12th century on the castle site. Since the 1990s, the castle has been gradually restored, including micro-piling to prevent the settlement of the structure.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nSince 2001, outdoor events, mainly concerts and knight tournaments, have been held in the castle courtyard from April to October. On 17 June 2008, a major renovation of the castle began, estimated at 23,600,000 PLN. Nearly 20 million PLN in funding for this purpose was obtained through the support of the European Union. In 2009, funding was obtained from the Silesian Voivodeship to establish the Moravian Gate Cultural Heritage Center at the castle. In the spring of 2009, the renovation team discovered a tunnel beneath the gate building leading towards Zamkowa Street. This tunnel was likely part of a canal system that drained water or sewage from the castle buildings. The entrance to the canal was hidden in the floor of one of the gate building rooms. The tunnel descended about five meters before a bend and a bricked-up wall with a gap, behind which lay a pile of brick rubble. A trial pit was dug in front of the gate building, but after reaching a depth of 4.7 meters, no tunnel vault was found. Therefore, the county office, as the owner of the castle, received 300,000 PLN from the Silesian Voivodeship Marshal to clear the corridor of debris and prepare it for tourist visits. The tunnel clearance was carried out by miners from the Central Mining Rescue Station in Bytom. During the work, a second tunnel was discovered, leading south from under the gate building. After removing the gate building's plaster, it was found to be in worse condition than expected, requiring \"strengthening of the walls and stitching\" as well as a new roof. During the cleaning of the so-called princely palace, a Gothic floor with a small masonry opening for collecting water was discovered in one of the cellars.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe castle features both Gothic and Renaissance elements, with stylistic features that have largely been erased. All buildings are made of brick and are plastered.\nThe castle was built on the site of an ancient stronghold located on a natural island surrounded by wooden-earth ramparts, a mill channel, and the main stream of the Oder river and its tributary. The only access to the fortress was via a causeway crossing the marshy terrain, with entry facilitated by a drawbridge. The stronghold consisted of wooden houses constructed with horizontal log beams stacked on top of each other, forming so-called log cabins, interconnected with connectors. Inside the houses, there were floors. The buildings were likely consumed by fire, as evidenced by traces of scorch marks and some charred elements found during archaeological excavations. The fortress probably had one stone building, which was the chapel. Inside were rooms for the castellan, his crew, and servants, as well as necessary agricultural buildings for the functioning of the stronghold. The main function of the structure was primarily defensive. Archaeological research confirmed the existence of seven cultural layers, ranging from the present buildings to traces of the ancient stronghold. The unmined layer of rock is located 5 meters below the courtyard. According to the conducted research, the establishment of the stronghold can be dated back to the 9th century at the earliest.\nIn 1281, the independent Duchy of Racibórz was established, prompting Przemysław of Racibórz to begin the reconstruction of the stronghold. As a result of the reconstruction completed in 1287, a compact complex of brick buildings was created, with the main accent being the residential building resembling a palace. Initially, the rampart surrounding the stronghold had a timber-frame structure, which in the first half of the 13th century was reinforced with earth masses and used as a foundation for the construction of a brick wall. The construction of the lower part of the walls utilized the Wendish brickwork, while the upper part utilized the Polish brickwork (Gothic). The second part of the defensive walls was built no earlier than the 15th century. Today, only the walls in the western and northeastern parts of the castle have survived, along with the foundations of the walls in the southeastern corner. Unfortunately, no tower or turret has survived to this day. The courtyard buildings date back to the 13th century and indicate the use of solutions employed by the Czechs. The fact that the reconstruction of the defensive system was based on the old wooden-earth rampart suggests that the castle began to serve a residential-representative function rather than a defensive one as before.\n\n\n=== Eastern wing ===\nThis section covers the main castle buildings, which are heterogeneous in terms of function and period of construction. To the north stands a residential building, which rests on the ancient walls of the Gothic castle, as well as a chapel, a gatehouse, and the ruins of a residential building in the southeast.\n\n\n==== Residential building, known as the princely palace ====\n\nThe grand masonry house, known as the princely palace, is attached to the eastern part of the walls and the northern wall of the chapel. Archaeological research confirms the existence of buildings dating back to the 12th/13th century in this location. In the 15th/16th century, the building was thoroughly rebuilt and expanded to the northern frontage of the courtyard. It neighbored the brewery building, located behind the castle walls. The building underwent reconstruction in the first half of the 17th century and after 1858, following a fire at the castle. The residential building is two-story, cellar-equipped, and erected on an elongated rectangular plan, with a slightly broken eastern side. The interior layout features one bay and has been significantly altered. The ground floor predominantly features barrel vaults and barrel-groin vaults with lowered arches. In the southern part, there is a winding staircase, also vaulted. The rooms on the upper floor are covered with ceilings. On the courtyard side, a masonry cloister with columned arcades, semi-circularly closed, is visible at the ground level. The cloister is partially vaulted. On the upper floor, there are protruding roof eaves supported by neo-Gothic wooden columns. The windows in the building have an irregular layout. The gable roof is covered with eternit, with newer dormers.\nOn the half-floor, right next to the northern wall of the castle chapel, one of the oldest graffiti in Poland is found. There are 17th-century inscriptions on the wall, probably made during the Thirty Years' War, left by soldiers stationed at the castle at that time. Also on the wall is the date of the year 1888. It is presumed that this room may have served as a prison, as legal proceedings took place in the adjacent hall.\n\n\n==== Chapel of St. Thomas Becket ====\n\nThe chapel was built between 1288 and 1293 as a result of the construction of the new masonry castle. Since the mid-19th century, the castle chapel has been called the pearl of Silesian Gothic due to its high level of artistic quality. The building is also known as the Silesian Sainte-Chapelle.\nThe temple, along with the castle residence, was added to the first section of walls from the east. It is located in the eastern wing of the castle, between the gatehouse and the main castle buildings. The chapel stands on the foundations of the previous temple. Initially, it was freestanding. It is built on a rectangular plan measuring 8.5 by 13 meters, is oriented, made of brick in a Wendish brickwork, plastered, and adorned with dimension stone details. The chapel was the first freestanding sacred building on Silesian lands, planted on a rectangular plan.\n\n\n==== Gatehouse ====\n\nInitially, the building was half the current length and was located in the first section of walls. It was likely built in the 13th century and rebuilt in the 13th/14th century. In the 14th/15th century, the building collapsed and was subsequently reconstructed. The building is set back from the courtyard, leaning considerably to the east. It dates from the first half of the 17th century, built on the foundation of a 14th-century structure, and reconstructed around 1950. The structure is two stories high and rectangular in plan. In the southern part, there is a passage with barrel vaults and lunettes on the arches. Additionally, there is a pointed arch arcade from the former Gothic gate. The northern part consists of several small rooms covered with ceilings. The rooms on the upper floor are also covered with ceilings. There are buttresses on the eastern corners and in the middle of the eastern and western external elevations. The eastern part of the elevation is crowned with two reconstructed gables, destroyed in 1945. The entrance to the castle is semicircular, with a nineteenth-century two-leaf plank gate. There are windows on the ground floor, with a seventeenth-century grille in the west. In the passage to the castle, there is a protruding stone corbel, probably from the Middle Ages. The building has a gable roof covered with tiles, with a transverse hip roof in the western part.\n\n\n==== Southeastern building ====\nThe building, added between 1603 and 1636, partially utilizes Gothic walls. Currently, only ruins of the structure remain, which was originally two stories high, built on a plan similar to a rectangle, with a slightly indented eastern side. The interiors had a two-bay layout. The southern part of the building shows traces of a barrel vault and a spiral staircase. The walls exhibit numerous alterations and preserved Gothic elements. The exterior elevation features a new cornice, beneath which there was once a seventeenth-century lunette cornice, now removed. In the wall, which is the only remnant of the former building, there are several stone window frames, and on the upper floor, one can see rectangular and profiled frames of the passage to the gatehouse. In the northwest corner, there is an embedded, sculpted, Gothic cantilever in the shape of a head, dating from the 13th/14th century.\n\n\n=== Northwestern wing ===\n\nThe wing used for economic purposes houses the headquarters of Castle Brewing Company. After the fire in 1858, it was rebuilt as a brewery, completely devoid of historical features. The building of the malt house and carriage house in the western part was probably erected in the 16th century. The ground floor of the western wing retains thick walls likely dating back to the first half of the 17th century. Additionally, in the extension of the western wing towards the south, there are preserved fragments of a double brick wall with different patterns: the inner circuit from the first half of the 17th century and the outer circuit Gothic, probably from the 15th century. The inner wall is taller.\n\n\n== Castle brewery ==\n\nThe first mention of a brewery existing in the castle dates back to 1532, with another in 1567. In 1559, a castle tavern was also mentioned. However, the true development of the Racibórz brewery occurred during the reign of the Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst family. At that time, Racibórz beer was consumed in canteens at Silesian factories and even in taverns in the Hlučín region.\nOn 19 January 1858, a fire broke out in the castle, which also consumed the brewery. The Racibórz duke decided to finance the construction of a new brewery. The previous building was demolished, and trees were planted in its place. The new building forms the northern wing of the castle to this day. The brewery was equipped with a steam engine, making it unmatched by the nine other municipal breweries.\nFrom 1896 to 1897, a complete modernization of the brewery took place, resulting in a modern brewhouse, machine room, boiler room, cooling room, malt drying room, lager cellar, beer storage, and quarters for brewery apprentices. In 1898, the facility employed 55 people, led by brewmaster Kaufmann. In 1899, the Racibórz brewery was already producing Pilsner beer. The beer was served in the Racibórz, Głubczyce, Koźle, Rybnik, and Hlučín regions. In Gliwice, there was a warehouse for Racibórz brew. The beer was present in factory canteens, at the stations in Racibórz and Kędzierzyn, in the princely inn in Sławięcice, as well as in Wrocław in a restaurant on Nowoświdnicka Street.\nThe quality of Racibórz beer was influenced by several factors: careful cultivation, harvesting, and cleaning of barley on the duke's estates. High-quality water was piped to the brewery from Obora using wooden pipes. Archaeological research conducted at the beginning of Bosadzka Street confirms the existence of hollowed-out wooden logs, which archaeologists believe to be part of a water supply system from Obora. Fragments of these pipes are now available to visitors at the museum. Hops were imported from Hallertau in Bavaria or the Czech Sudetes. Additionally, until 1945, the beer was stored in wooden barrels, although metal ones were used in other breweries. The primary and secondary fermentation process took place in the lager cellar in special vats, then in lager barrels made of oak. The secondary fermentation lasted for three months, which was not practiced in other Upper Silesian breweries. Before being refilled, each barrel was tarred and cleaned.\nDuring World War I and afterward, the Racibórz brewery faced a crisis. Many markets were lost, and there were numerous difficulties with importing the raw materials needed to produce beer. However, the greatest loss was the death of brewmaster Kaufmann, who took his secret recipe to the grave. In the 1930s, new and large brewing companies emerged, offering much cheaper but also lower-quality goods. This fact led to the disappearance of the Racibórz brand from the market.\nIn 2004, after renovation and the installation of brewing equipment from Tymbark, the brewery resumed operations. In 2009, it was announced that the brewery will be liquidated. Production resumed in 2010. Beer is still brewed at the Racibórz brewery as it was centuries ago, in open vats.\n\n\n== Mysteries and legends associated with the castle ==\n\nThe tunnel is one of the mysteries associated with the castle, which was supposed to lead from the Dominican monastery to the castle. The secret passage was said to have been built at the end of the 13th century, during the reign of Przemysław of Racibórz, when his daughter Euphemia joined the Dominican convent. The tunnel was supposed to enable meetings between father and daughter, and also, in case of danger, provide the nuns with an escape route to the castle. In 1988, the city authorities, along with the Catholic Church, reached an agreement regarding the renovation of the castle chapel. During the renovation works, a map dating back to 1843 was found in the turret on the spire of the chapel. It depicted the state of the city's buildings from 1843 and 1858 due to handwritten annotations.\nThe map became a historical discovery because of the annotations made by Robert Schneider, who likely supervised the reconstruction of the castle after the fire. He marked on the map an underground tunnel that started at the site of the old castle tower and ended at the Dominican monastery. It was probably the legendary passage under the Odra river described by Hyckel. In 2001, archaeological research was conducted at the site of the former tower in the southeastern corner, which led to the discovery of an entrance to an underground corridor. The corridor led to the basement of the tower, where an entrance leading towards the Odra river was found. This was probably where the legendary tunnel began. This passage was likely destroyed in the 19th century during the Odra river flood, which caused the walls to collapse.\n\nOne of the legends is described by Augustyn Weltzel:On the grounds of the northern and western wings, a steam brewery was erected. In the middle of the courtyard stands a well. A longitudinal, massive entrance gate has been preserved, adorned with the princely coat of arms. Behind it, to the left, on the protruding, sharp corner of the house, there is a bricked-up stone head, whose eyes are directed towards the well or slightly higher. Although it does not resemble a Tatar face, it is nevertheless considered to be the head of that Mongolian prince who was defeated here in the 13th century. Associated with this strange figure is the legend that precisely in this place, to which the stone eyes are directed, there is a great treasure. The late director general Gustaw Adolf von Wiese, who died on March 29, 1880, amused by the curiosity of foreigners who were closely examining this architectural curiosity, jokingly confirmed the truth by saying: the legend is true, this head is looking at the real treasure, by which he meant the brewery located opposite.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNewerla, Paweł (2008).

In his high-rolling heyday, Julian once spent $2,300 to buy a round of champagne for everyone at the Ship Cafe in Venice.\nHe fled the country to avoid prosecution and committed suicide by intentional drug overdose at the Astor House Hotel in Shanghai, China, on March 25, 1934. At the time of Julian's death his wife and two daughters lived in Winnipeg. He was buried in a \"foreign cemetery\" in Shanghai on May 11, 1934, in a service attended only by his 19-year-old companion Leonora Levy and her sister.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTygiel, Jules (1994).

        "content": "Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals is the 29th season of Fortnite: Battle Royale. C5S2 focuses on Greek mythology bringing the Gods of Olympus(Zeus, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, Apollo), other Greek mythology related characters like Hades, Cerberus, Medusa, Perseus, etc., and Greek inspired mythics to the game, which include Zeus' Thunderbolt, Chains of Hades and Wings of Icarus. Following the events of Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1: Underground, where the Pandora's box unleashed evils and chaos onto to the island, the Greek gods arrived to get rid of the evils. Enraged by the opening of Pandora's box, Zeus decides to end all of mankind which serves as the main conflict of this season. Myths and Mortals was scheduled to launch on March 8, 2024, at 9AM EST, however due to glitches and bugs, Epic Games delayed the game all the way until 9PM EST.\nDespite the delays, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals was met with initial universal acclaim receiving praise for the return of a proper storyline, constant updates, the inclusion of two new biomes(the Olympus and Underworld biome), loot pool and battle pass. Many called it one of the best Fortnite seasons in a while and one of the all-time best. As the season went on, it was met with less favorable reviews, however, was still very well received.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nFortnite Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals launched with 4 new weapons, the Warforged Assault Rifle, Harbinger SMG, Gatekeeper Shotgun and the Huntress DMR. Later on the season, it also unvaulted the drumgun and Hand Cannon which were also updated to have weapon mods. Mythics included Zeus' Thunderbolt, Wings of Icarus, Chains of Hades and Banana of the Gods.\n\n\n=== Mythics ===\nZeus' Thunderbolt allowed you to ascend above and throw thunderbolts at the opponent. Since, the launch of the season, the community has been complaining about the thunderbolt being very broken, especially since it could go through builds which was heavily criticized by competitive Fortnite players.\nThe Chains of Hades are a multi-functional tool used to attack opponents and also pull items towards you similar to the Harpoon Gun. It has an attack cycle of 3 with the first two attacks dealing 55 damage and the 3rd hit dealing 80 damage with a combined total of 190 damage. The Chains of Hades also have a secondary attack which deals 60 damage and pulls opponents and teammates towards your location (including players out of Cars and those flying with the Wings of Icarus). The secondary attack can also pull items towards the user and can even pull items from Fishing Spots.\nThe Wings of Icarus allow the player to ascend into the air and maintain flight with multi-directional control for a prolonged period of time. As the player remains airborne, the Wings will slowly start to burn, eventually forcing a landing. When high enough, a Dive Bomb attack can be used. It consists of a high impact landing that deals damage to all structures in a 3x3 area and knocks opponents back, dealing them damage that can pierce through destroyed buildings. When the player receives substantial damage mid-air, they will immediately crash to the ground, forcefully performing the Dive Bomb attack. After crashing, the cooldown before using the Wings of Icarus again will be 12s instead of the normal 5s. When the Wings of Icarus are held, the player will be rendered immune to fall damage. This effect takes place even outside of flight. A player can carry more than one Wings of Icarus in their inventory at the same time. When a player finish using the Wings of Icarus, all Wings of Icarus in their inventory enter cooldown.\nBanana of the Gods is a foraged item which you can use to heal your health. It also gives you more speed and jump for a while.\n\n\n=== Medallions ===\nMedallions were changed from Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1: Underground. Instead of healing your shields, medallions now have their own abilities. \n\n\n=== Map Changes ===\nTwo new biomes were introduced to the map along with Ruined Reels from Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1: Underground being updated to Restored Reels. Weapons mods were changed to now spawn in bunkers which would open after the 3rd zone.\n\n\n==== Olympus ====\nThe Olympus biome include the pois, Mount Olympus and Brawler's Battleground. Zeus appears as an NPC Boss at Mount Olympus and upon defeating him, the player gets the Aspect of Speed medallion, Zeus' mythic Huntress DMR, Zeus' Thunderbolt and flowberry fizz. Ares appears as an NPC Boss at Brawler's Battleground and upon defeating him, the player gets the Aspect of Combat medallion, Ares' mythic Warforged Assault Rifle, and flowberry fizz.\n\n\n==== The Underworld ====\nThe Underworld biome include the pois, The Underworld and Grim Gate. Hades appears as an NPC Boss at The Underworld and upon defeating him, the player gets the Aspect of Siphon medallion, Hades' mythic Harbinger SMG, and flowberry fizz. Cerberus appears as an NPC Boss at Grim Gate and upon defeating him, the player gets the Aspect of Agility medallion, Cerberus' mythic Gatekeeper shotgun, and flowberry fizz.\n\n\n== Battle Pass ==\nOut of the 8 skins in the pass, 7 of them were based on Greek mythology with that one skin being Korra which was done for a collab between Fortnite and Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nThe skins included in the pass:\n\n950 Vbucks\n\n\n== Fortnite x Avatar: The Last Airbender ==\nFortnite did a collab with Avatar: The Last Airbender bringing 4 mythics to the game and 5 skins, with 3 of them going to the item shop and 2(Aang) going to the Elements Pass.\n\n\n=== Mythics ===\nWaterbending, Firebending, Earthbending and Airbending were added to the game for the collab.\n\nA mini-pass was added with a free and premium track(for 1000 vbucks). The top reward for the free track was the Appa glider and the top reward for the premium track was Avatar Stage Aang.\nAvatar officially ended on May 3, 2024, following the arrival of the Star Wars event.\n\n\n== Star Wars Event ==\nA Star Wars event was launched on May 3, 2024, with the inclusion of 3 mythics, the Wookie Bowcaster and E11-Blasters, Darth Vader's lightsaber and Imperial Chests. Star Wars cosmetics were added to the item shop with 3 new skins. Chewbacca was added to the first ever Lego Battle pass which was sold for 1400 Vbucks.\n\n\n== Follow up ==\nFortnite Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals is scheduled to end on May 24, 2024, at 2AM EST and will be followed by Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Noah's Ark is a 2024 animation film directed by Sérgio Machado and Alois Di Leo. The film is a Brazilian and Indian coproduction. It is based on the biblical episode of Noah's Ark in the Book of Genesis such as it was adapted by Vinicius de Moraes.\nThe film was produced by Walter Salles.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nTito and Vini are two mice who like to sing and play music. They surprise a conversation between Noah and God and realise that Earth will be flooded.\nTom and Vini try to board the ark Noah and his family (Susanah, his daughter and Ruth, his wife) have prepared. But Noah refuses as both Tom and Vini are male. As all animal couples are entering the ship, and a female mouse, Nina, arrives, Vini leaves, despite Tom's protests, so that his friend can be saved.\nVini is saved from drowning by a cockroach and his crew, sailing on a small boat. They find the Ark and board through a whole that has been made by rogue big mammals, who have entered the food storage room to help themselves. To avoid the Lion King that leads that group take control, a musical contest is organised. But the Lion's musical capacities are weak and Vine and Tito perform for him behind a curtain. When the trick is discovered, all animals, even his friends, stop recognising the authority of the cheater. It is also the moment when arks finally reaches land and all the occupants can be saved.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTito and Vini have been presented as evocations of Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes.\nA French review found the film mediocre.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yadavs in Maharashtra or Ahirs in Maharashtra are members of the Ahir/Yadav community of Maharashtra. They are also known as Gavli, Jadhav, Ahir-Rao, Ahire, etc. The 1881 census records of the British India stated that the Yadavas who in their turn are identified with the Gaolis (Gavlis) and Ahirs were the dominant race at that time.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome authorities have suggested that Ahirs (today Yadavs) migrated to Maharashtra from Punjab and Sindh in early historic times. other researchers have hypothesized that these people have inhabited Maharashtra for the last 5,000 to 10,000 years.\n\n\n== Dynasties ==\n\n\n=== Abhira ===\n\nThe Puranas claim that the Ahirs or Abhiras were the successors of the Satavahanas. Ishwarsena was the founder of the Abhira dynasty and he started an era which later became known as the Kalchuri-Chedi era. The German scholar F. Kielhorn suggested that the system began in September 248, the year that began with the month of Asvina. It was first used in Gujarat and Maharashtra (particularly Northern Maharashtra), from where it spread to Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where it was used until the 13th century CE.\n\n\n=== Yadava ===\n\nIn the Puranic geography the country from the Tapti to Deogarh is called the Abhira, or the region of cowherds. It seems probable that they were connected with the Yadavas who were in power in the eighth, and again appear as the rulers of Daulatabad (or Deogiri) in the 12th and 13th century.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The concept of the Ground of the Soul (German: Seelengrund) is a term of late medieval philosophy and spirituality that also appears in early modern spiritual literature. The concept was coined by Meister Eckhart (d. 1327/1328) and refers in a figurative sense to a \"place\" in the human soul where, according to spiritual teachings, God or the divine is present and a union of divinity with the soul can come about.\nFrom antiquity, philosophers and theologians proposed theories that later became prerequisites and components of medieval teachings on the ground of the soul. The relevant medieval terminology can also be traced back to the concepts of these thinkers. Ancient Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophers were convinced that there was a guiding authority in the human soul that was analogous or of the same nature as the divine power that governed the universe. This established the possibility of a connection between mortal and error-prone human beings and the realm of the eternal, divine and absolute truth. Church writers took up philosophical concepts of the relationship between God and the soul and reshaped them in a Christian sense. The church father Augustine assumed that there was a realm in the depths of the human mind, the abditum mentis, in which a hidden a priori knowledge lay.\nIn the 12th century, concepts were developed according to which it was possible to contemplate God in the innermost realm of the soul. However, it was not until the late Middle Ages that a fully formed doctrine of the unity of the soul with the divinity at the ground of the soul emerged. Its originator was Meister Eckhart, who referred to St Augustine but primarily proclaimed his own unconventional doctrine of the divine in the human soul, which was offensive at the time. He postulated the existence of an innermost divine quality in the soul, which he designated as the \"ground.\" The ground of the soul was not a creation of God but rather existed above and beyond all created things. It was a simple and limitless entity, devoid of any limiting determinations, and was identical to the \"Godhead,\" the supra-personal aspect of the divine. All created entities are devoid of access to the divine, whereas the uncreated, supra-temporal ground of the soul provides an experience of God, as the godhood is always present there. Eckhart described this experience as the \"birth of God\" in the ground of the soul. The prerequisite for this was \"seclusion\": the soul had to detach itself with the utmost consistency from everything that distracted it from the divine simplicity and undifferentiatedness in its innermost being.\nEckhart's doctrine of the ground of the soul was condemned by the Church as heretical shortly after his death. However, its content was sometimes accepted in a modified form by late medieval seekers of God. In modern times, it has often been regarded as an expression of mystical irrationalism. However, more recent historians of philosophy emphasise that Eckhart in no way devalued reason; rather, he sought to convince with a philosophical argument and understood the ground of the soul as intellect.\nIn the early modern period, the concept of the ground of the soul or soul centre as a place to experience God survived in spiritual literature. It was adopted by Catholic authors as well as in Protestant pietism. The Enlightenment thinkers gave a different meaning to the expression \"soul ground\". They used it to describe the place of a \"dark\" realisation from which clarity emerges.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nIn antiquity, pagan and Christian authors developed doctrines of the soul that anticipated elements of Meister Eckhart's model. This involved a part of the soul that was regarded as divine or godlike or a divine entity within it.\n\n\n==== Early approaches ====\nThe pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus (d. 460 BCE) posited that the boundaries of the soul could not be identified even through exhaustive travel of all paths, as its \"logos\" was very deep. Heraclitus regarded the soul as a representative part of the cosmic fire, the power that, according to his teachings, constituted all things and upon which the processes in the universe depended. He also described the soul as a spark of the substance of the stars.\nIn his work, Plato (d. 348/347 BCE) developed a model of the soul in which he ascribed to it a three-part, hierarchically organised structure. According to his theory, the lowest of the three parts of the soul is controlled by sensual desires and is of a passionate and reckless nature. In contrast, the highest part, the sphere of reason, is characterised by its opposite qualities. The middle part, the \"courageous\", is situated between reason and desire. Its function is to implement the decisions arrived at by reason. Since reason is the source of wisdom, it is naturally accorded the highest rank. According to the natural order, this part of the soul is entitled to rule over the other parts and the body, because only reason can judge what is beneficial for the whole and, thanks to this insight, is capable of correct guidance. The rational part of the soul is imbued with divine qualities. It is akin to the divine, eternal and immutable, and is similarly unborn and imperishable. Its endeavour is directed towards knowledge. The goal is not only knowledge that is gained through a discursive process; rather, it is primarily about a special experiential knowledge of the highest order, which everyone can only strive for themselves. Plato leaves open the extent to which such knowledge is attainable. The experiential knowledge he is referring to results from a kind of insight that has an intuitive and religious character and relates to a transcendent, divine realm. The object of such a vision is something that cannot be conceptualised in language. Such an experience is \"unspeakable\" (árrhēton), since it cannot be justified or communicated. It cannot be objectified and cannot be right or wrong; it is only either given or not given to the subject.\n\n\n==== Stoic conception of the soul ====\nThe Stoics adopted conventional ideas, including the Platonic model, and modified them. They considered primordial fire to be the divine force that had unfolded and shaped the universe and that permeated, animated, moved and maintained it in being. They regarded the human being as a \"microcosm\", a \"small world\" in which the order of the \"macrocosm\" was reflected. The Stoics ascribed the role of the vitalising fire in the microcosm to the human soul, which they saw as an image of the deity who directed the cosmos. This led to the metaphor of the \"soul spark\", whereby the individual soul was conceived as a spark (apóspasma, torn-off part) of the divine primordial fire. At the core of the soul, the Stoics posited the existence of a guiding and coordinating authority, the hēgemonikón, which they typically situated in the heart. According to Stoic doctrine, this nucleus of the soul initiates and coordinates the various faculties, including imagination, thought, and will, following a uniform plan and directs them towards a unified goal: the preservation of the whole. The hegemonikon in the heart is the organising principle – the Logos – of man, just as the primordial fire, which has its seat in the sun, plays the role of the organising and structuring principle in the cosmos. The Logos in man corresponds to the world Logos; the nature of the macrocosm and the microcosm are one and the same.\nThe Greek Stoics' theory of the soul was adopted by the educated Romans, with the relevant terms being translated into Latin and incorporated into the terminology of Roman philosophical literature. Subsequently, the Greek and Latin expressions entered the vocabulary of the Church Fathers. The term hegemonikon was translated or paraphrased in various ways: principale cordis (\"main instance of the heart\") in Seneca, Jerome, Rufinus; principatus (\"guiding principle\", \"basic power\") in Cicero; regalis pars animi (\"the royal part of the spirit\") in Apuleius. The renowned Roman Stoic Seneca (d. 65) believed that the soul of the wise man, who could not be shaken by anything, possessed superhuman strength; a divine power had descended into him. The larger part of this soul remained where the smaller, descended part had come from. Following the Stoic tradition, Seneca used the image of the \"spark\" (scintilla) to visualise the divine origin of the spiritual principle in a person: Sparks of stars had fallen to earth, as it were, and remained in this place far from heaven. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (d. 180), who also professed the Stoic doctrine and wrote in Greek, claimed that the hegemonikon was unconquerable \"when it is content with itself, withdrawn into itself\", because it does nothing that it does not want. He compared it to a castle; those who seek refuge there become invincible.\n\n\n==== Neoplatonic concepts of the soul ====\nThe concept of a divine entity in the soul plays a central role in Plotinus (d. 270), the founder of Neoplatonism. According to his teachings, the immortal soul originates from an immaterial, purely spiritual world in which it is at home and enjoys bliss. However, it can descend into the physical world and temporarily connect with a body, which it then controls and uses as a tool. This is how earthly life comes about. However, the soul does not bind itself to the body in its entirety; rather, it only partially does so. \"Something of it\", its highest \"part\", always remains in the spiritual world. The term part is used here in a figurative sense, not in the sense of a spatial division or a real divisibility; the soul forms an indissoluble unity. The highest part of the soul is of divine quality, its bliss is never interrupted. The soul thus constantly shares in the entire fullness of the spiritual world, even if its embodied part becomes confused and suffers misfortune. However, this fact usually remains hidden from human consciousness because it is so overwhelmed by sensory impressions that it is unable to grasp what the uppermost part of the soul perceives. The soul experiences the manifold hardships and inadequacies of earthly existence, but the affects (emotions) that arise only affect it seemingly. These beliefs are based on illusions, as the soul is actually, in its highest and most important aspect, free from suffering. This aspect is permanently focused on the universal spirit (Nous), or the \"Platonic ideas\", which it contemplates with great delight. In contrast, the lower parts or layers of the soul are more or less oriented towards the material and sensually perceptible realm, and thus susceptible to numerous evils. However, if one leads a philosophical life, they can also orientate themselves towards the spiritual. It is therefore, ideally, that the parts will be in agreement; that their different functions will be harmonised and that the whole will be unified.\nPlotinus's doctrine of an unassailable supreme part of the soul, removed from all earthly evils, anticipated central elements of the medieval concept of the ground of the soul. As his pupil Porphyry observed, he aimed to \"elevate the divine in the individual souls to the divine in space\". He held the soul in high regard, deriving its dignity from its divine aspect. He is renowned for his assertion that he did not engage in worship, stating that \"those (the gods) must come to me, not I to them\". With the assumption that there is something divine in the soul, he created the theoretical basis for his thesis that a union of the individual with the absolutely transcendent highest principle, the One, was possible and worth striving for. He even asserted that unity with the One, in which everything that exists has its origin, could be experienced during earthly life. The term hénōsis (union, becoming one) has become commonplace for such an experience of unity. According to Porphyry, Plotinus claimed henosis as a repeated act for himself. Porphyrios mentioned that his teacher had experienced unity about four times in the five years they spent together. Plotinus emphasised that the experience occurred suddenly.\nPlotinus' description of henosis is in substantial agreement with the medieval depictions of the experience of being in the ground of the soul. This includes the de-differentiation associated with henosis, the transition into the formlessness of the undifferentiated, absolutely unified One; this corresponds to Meister Eckhart's demand to become \"wayless\", just as God is \"without way/manner\" (without determination). The concept of \"seclusion\", which is central to Eckhart's teaching, can also be discerned in Plotinus's writings. For instance, Plotinus states that the \"life of the gods and divine, blessed men\" is a \"departure\" (apallagḗ) from everything earthly (\"from everything else that is here\"), a \"flight of the One to the One\" or \"flight of the lonely to the lonely\". According to Plotinus, one enters into seclusion in \"calm divine fulfilment\", a state of motionlessness in which nothing distracts. He compared this to entering a sanctuary (ádyton), the innermost chamber of a temple. This \"departure\" is a highly individualised self-identification with the source, the One, to whom, according to Neoplatonic philosophy, everything that exists owes its existence. For Plotinus, as in late medieval spirituality, the prerequisite for this is a radical separation of consciousness from everything that is not the source. Identification with the pure unity that excludes nothing requires that one does not hold on to anything that belongs to the world of the particular, of duality and multiplicity. However, a direct influence of Plotinus' writings on medieval authors can be ruled out, as his works were unknown in Western and Central Europe at the time.\nThe thesis that the highest part of the soul always remains in the spiritual world was firmly rejected by Iamblichus (d. 320/325) and the late antique Neoplatonists who followed him. They believed that the soul descends completely when it connects with a body. One of Iamblichos' arguments was that the assumption of a permanent communion of a part of the soul with the divine realm was inconsistent because such a connection could not be unconscious. Rather, if such a communion existed, all people would have to be happy all the time. Proclus (d. 485), one of the most influential neo-Platonists of late antiquity, also attacked Plotinus' position. He considered the thesis that \"something of our soul remains above\" to be contradictory. On the other hand, he argued that that which, according to such a model, always remains at the top could never connect with that which sinks downwards, as there must be a gulf of principle between them. Furthermore, one should not assume that the nature of souls and that of the spiritual world and the gods are the same. Rather, the soul is inherently subordinate to the hierarchy of entities, as it is not a component of the spiritual world but rather a product of it. For the Neoplatonists of late antiquity, Plotinus' optimistic assessment of the relationship between the incarnate soul (living in the physical world) and higher levels seemed unrealistic and presumptuous. Nevertheless, they shared his conviction that the spiritual world was not closed to the incarnate soul and that it was absolutely desirable to connect with it. Proklos also believed that it was possible to ascend to the transcendent One. According to his teachings, the possibility of meeting the One is based on the fact that there is \"the One in us\", and \"the One in the soul\", which the Demiurge, the creator of the world, has implanted there. This individual One also referred to as the \"flower of the soul\", is \"the most divine of what is in us\", the most \"unified\" and \"united\" in people, the principle that creates their unity and unites the diversity within them. It is not the same as the transcendent One, but it is analogous; it is its \"image\" or \"seed\". Due to this similarity structure, the transcendent One is recognisable and attainable. This necessitates the recognition of the \"One in us\". Proklos advocated the awakening of the \"One in us\" and the ignition of this entity in fervour, thereby facilitating the connection of the soul with the transcendent One. This connection can be likened to the anchoring of the soul in this entity. This upward movement of the soul necessitates a \"divinising impetus\".\n\n\n==== Reception in ancient Christianity ====\nThe ecclesiastical writer Origen, a contemporary of Plotinus, engaged with the reflections of the pagan philosophers on the relationship between the soul and divinity. He reshaped traditional ideas in a Christian sense by presenting the innermost realm of the human spirit as the place of God's presence in human beings and the meeting point between the human and the divine. This is where there is direct contact with the divine in the form of cognition, which is fundamentally different from the normal cognition of external objects. Origen thus introduced a distinction between normal, rational cognition employing the faculty of thought and knowledge of God based on a special ability of the soul that is only intended for this purpose. In doing so, he departed from the Platonic tradition, which did not distinguish between \"natural\" and \"supernatural\" cognition. Rather, all acts of cognition were attributed to the same principle, which unfolded on different levels. The Platonists assumed a continuity running through all forms of knowledge. Origen contrasted this view with the separation between rational and irrational or supra-rational cognition, which had far-reaching consequences in the history of ideas.\nThe influential Church Father Augustine (d. 430) espoused the Platonic view, which did not distinguish between fundamentally different types of knowledge of the human mind. In his work De trinitate, Augustine coined the term abditum mentis, which translates as \"hiding place of the mind\" or \"the hidden part of the mind\". He employed this term to describe an area within the depths of the human mind to which he ascribed a priori knowledge, which he regarded as the foundation of thought and cognition. According to his theory, this knowledge is always present within this area, but hidden and therefore unconscious; however, it can be brought to consciousness through thought. The \"hidden depth of our memory\" is the place where people encounter content that does not originate from their stored memories, but which they think for the first time. This is the site of the \"innermost word,\" which is not reducible to any language. In the act of thinking, an insight emerges that is derived from an insight that was already present, though previously obscured.\nAugustine's reflections on the abditum mentis, which were influenced by Neoplatonic thought, were taken up in the Middle Ages and utilised for the discourse on the ground of the soul. However, it is unclear whether Augustine understood this as a specific instance and a guiding principle of the entire life of the soul, as medieval authors believed.\n\n\n=== High Middle Ages ===\nIn the 12th century, the question of the conditions and nature of the relationship between God and the soul gained new relevance. The prevailing concepts of the soul at the time were significantly influenced by the Augustinian tradition. Among the spiritually orientated writers, the most influential were the \"Victorians\", theologians of the canon monastery of Saint-Victor in Paris, as well as monks of the Cistercian order. In these circles, the possibility of knowing God was attributed to a \"faculty of the soul\" (potentia animae), which served this specific purpose. This meant a special power (vis) or ability present in the human soul. The terminology originally introduced by Aristotle and later translated into Latin was used, in which the individual activities of the soul such as perception, thinking and movement were assigned to specific dispositions, the \"faculties\". These faculties were organised hierarchically according to the rank of their objects. The highest faculty of the soul, activated during the experience of God, was referred to as the \"intellect\" (intellectus) and was distinguished from the ratio, the faculty responsible for conceptual thinking. Some authors described it metaphorically as an organ of the soul. Hugh of Saint Victor, for example, taught that the soul had three \"eyes\". The first faculty, the eye of the flesh, enables the soul to perceive the physical world. The second faculty, the eye of the ratio, allows the soul to observe itself and its interior. The third faculty, the eye of contemplation, enables the soul to perceive God and the divine within itself (intra se). However, this faculty is extinguished as a result of original sin and the soul is now unable to perceive God in an unmediated manner. Consequently, humanity is no longer capable of perceiving God directly; rather, it must rely on faith. It is only in the promised future bliss that the ability to perceive God directly will be restored.\nHugo's concept of the three eyes of the soul had a considerable impact in medieval spiritual literature. Additionally, there was the idea of a specific area or place in the soul or in the human spirit (mens) where the realisation of God occurred. This area, which was regarded as the most important, could only be the core of the soul, its innermost being, and the highest level within it. It was regarded as the actual seat of man's likeness to God. In this sense, Richard of Saint Victor, taking up an idea of Augustine, stated that in the human spirit \"without doubt the highest is at the same time the innermost and the innermost at the same time the highest\". Richard considered it possible to ascend to the \"highest and innermost womb of the spirit\", to grasp and hold it and to contemplate the invisible divine there. However, he noted that this perception could not be achieved through voluntary means and that it was only granted to a select few. It is realised through the spiritual sense (sensus intellectualis), which is distinct from the rational sense (sensus rationalis). With the sense of reason, man perceives his own invisible realm. The divine realm in the human mind is separated by a thick curtain of oblivion. Those who venture there forget not only everything external but also everything that is within themselves. Even when returning to the familiar world, the curtain causes forgetting, but not complete forgetting. Consequently, one can remember the experience afterwards, but only in an inadequate way, no longer in the original truth and clarity.\nIn the first half of the 13th century, the Dutch beguine Hadewijch, who probably lived near Antwerp, described the relationship between the soul and God in a way that anticipated elements of late medieval doctrines of the soul in terms of content and terminology. Hadewijch already uses the terms \"ground\" (Middle Dutch gront), \"abyss\" (afgront) and \"bottomlessness\" (grondeloesheit). She employed such expressions to describe the mutual interpenetration of God and the human soul united with him. The concept of \"groundlessness\" bears resemblance to Meister Eckhart's description of the deity as \"groundless ground\", although there is no evidence that he was familiar with the beguine's writings. Hadewijch did not develop a theological or philosophical system; rather, she drew upon her own ecstatic experiences, attempting to convey them in words. In her 18th letter, she described the soul as \"bottomlessness in which God is self-sufficient\". God's self-sufficiency finds its fullest enjoyment in it and it in turn in him. God is a way in which the soul comes out into its freedom, namely into the ground of God, which cannot be touched without the depth of the soul. In her writings, Hadewijch depicted the unity of God with the soul in a manner that suggests a profound merging of the two entities (enecheit), to the extent that they become indistinguishable, at least on one level.\n\n\n== Late medieval concepts of the soul ==\nThe term \"Seelengrund\" is believed to have originated from the language used in Middle High German courtly poetry. Here, the term \"Herzensgrund\" was employed to describe profound, intimate emotions. This metaphor of the ground to describe something profound was subsequently transferred to the realm of spiritual literature. Following the mid-13th century, Mechthild of Magdeburg posited that the heart of Mary, the Mother of God, possessed \"the deepest ground of divine knowledge before all people\".\nTheological and philosophical concepts of the ground of the soul only emerged in the Late Middle Ages. Their authors and principal representatives were all German members of the Dominican Order (Order of Preachers) and disseminated their teachings on the ground of the soul in German. In England, the term \"ground\" (Middle English: grounde) was used in late medieval spiritual literature for the nature or substance of man or the soul; it is particularly common in Julian of Norwich. Although there are similarities between the English and German uses of the term, the core elements of the German doctrines were either absent in England or only present in a rudimentary form.\n\n\n=== Meister Eckhart ===\n\n\n==== Linking up with tradition ====\nThe term \"ground of the soul\" was introduced into medieval spiritual discourse by Meister Eckhart (d. 1327/1328). In doing so, he referred to Augustine's remarks on the \"hiddenness of the spirit\", which he interpreted in terms of his doctrine of the soul. He frequently quoted the words \"in abdito mentis\" from Augustine's De trinitate. He translated them into Middle High German with \"in dem verborgensten der sêle\" and similar phrases. He equated the \"hiddenness of the spirit\" discussed in De trinitate with what he called the ground of the soul. However, in doing so, he gave the ancient expression a new meaning, as his thinking took him in a direction that led him far away from Augustine's concept. The ancient church father had employed the term \"hiding place\" to signify the location of unconscious ideas (notitiae), which pertain to specific contents of thought and emerge into the field of consciousness (conspectus mentis) during the act of thinking. Consequently, he was preoccupied with concepts, with latent knowledge related to individual things, which he situated in the abditum mentis. In contrast, Eckhart perceived the \"ground of the soul\" as a domain from which all forms of imagination and conceptual thought are precluded in principle. Consequently, his engagement with Augustine's thought and formulation was more formal than substantial.\n\n\n==== The distinction between God and Godhead ====\nEckhart's understanding of the relationship between the soul and the divine is fundamentally based on his distinction between \"God\" (in the narrower sense) and \"Godhead\". In his teaching, these two terms denote two separate levels of the reality of the divine or God in the broader sense. According to him, God (in the narrower sense) and deity are as far apart as heaven and earth. At the lower level is God in the narrower sense, that is, God in his capacity as Creator, who faces his creatures as such. In this context, \"God\" is the counter-concept to everything created; God stands in a relationship of cause and effect to everything that exists apart from him. The higher level, \"above God\", is the place of the divine as \"Godhead\" or as a \"one-fold One\", which has no relationship whatsoever to anything outside itself. Eckhart's Godhead causes nothing; it is not an entity that creates and thus forms a contrast to the created. Given that it is absolute unity, it is also not the triune God in the sense of the doctrine of the Trinity, who appears in three persons, and not the Father, who begets the Son Jesus Christ. Rather, it is the super-personal, absolutely unified aspect of the divine reality as a whole. God, on the other hand, is personal; he maintains an I-Thou relationship with his creatures and also develops an inner-trinitarian life and relationship within himself. The Godhead does not produce anything; it does not procreate or generate. \"God works, the Godhead does not work. (...) God and deity are distinguished by working and non-working.\"\nNevertheless, the distinction between \"God\" and \"Godhead\" is not consistently made throughout Eckhart's use of language. On occasion, he employs the term \"God\" in a more restricted sense, solely to designate the Creator. At other times, he uses it in a broader sense, encompassing the supra-personal \"Godhead\" or making specific reference to it. The intended meaning in each case is clear from the context. The notion of two distinct types of God, or of God as differentiated within himself, appears to be present even in instances where it is not explicitly articulated in terms of terminology.\nIt is not possible to make any definitive statements about Eckhart's concept of Godhead, as it is beyond any differentiation. It is \"wayless\", i.e. without characteristics by which it could be defined; it is a \"groundless ground\" and a \"silent desert\", a \"monotonous silence\". In a similar manner to the Neoplatonic One, the Godhead cannot be defined by any characteristics, as this would also result in limitations and incompatibility with its undifferentiated character. Consequently, all characteristics attributed to God, such as goodness, power or wisdom, must be denied. Even the concept of being is excluded, as being is also a determination and therefore incompatible with the undetermined. Consequently, the assertion that the Godhead \"is\" is erroneous; rather, it is a matter of \"a supersubstantial being and a supersubstantial non-being\". By persistently rejecting all positive statements about the Godhead, Eckhart adhered to the tenets of \"negative theology\", particularly those espoused by the ancient thinker Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.\nThe level at which God exists as a person with personal attributes is separate from and subordinate to that of the Godhead. Since it is impossible to bring a purpose into that which is without purpose, God, like everything else that is purposeful, has no access to the impersonal aspect of the divine, unless he were to divest himself of his attributes and leave aside everything that constitutes his particularity. Eckhart observed: \"This is easy to see, for this certain One is without manner and particularity. And therefore, if God is ever to look into it, it must cost him all his divine names and his peculiarity; he must leave all that outside if he is ever to look into it.\"\n\n\n==== The soul and its ground ====\nEckhart defined the divine core area of the soul, its hidden \"innermost being\", which according to his teachings is timeless and spaceless and in which complete peace reigns, as the ground of the soul. He also used a number of other terms for this, including the \"spark\", \"light\" or \"Bürglein\", the \"highest\", \"purest\" or \"head\" of the soul. Nevertheless, Eckhart also emphasised that the ground of the soul is actually nameless, in a manner analogous to the Godhead. According to Eckhart's teachings, the outer realms in which the soul's activities take place are to be distinguished from this unchanging core area, which is removed from any kind of change and far removed from any activity. This is where the soul influences its surroundings and is in turn influenced by its environment. This is where its will and desires are expressed in words and deeds, while at the same time it stores what it experiences as external influences in its memory. The soul fulfils its tasks with its various faculties, which are described in the relevant writings of Aristotle that were authoritative in the late Middle Ages. The soul must utilise its faculties to fulfil the requirements of its connection with the body and to ensure the survival of the human being. In doing so, it comes into contact with created and transient things. This means constant change, constant becoming and passing away. The ground of the soul is separated from this sphere; the manifold impressions that flow in from the world of sensory perception do not reach it.\nAs a supra-spatial and supra-temporal entity that exerts no influence and is not influenced by external factors, the ground of the soul aligns with Eckhart's concept of Godhead. Additionally, it shares a similar quality: it is completely undifferentiated. In contrast to the outer realms of the soul, it lacks distinguishable, co-existing contents or functions. At the ground of the soul, the soul has no ideas whatsoever, neither of itself nor anything created or of God. It has \"neither working nor understanding\" there. All distinctions are suspended. In a manner analogous to the absolute undifferentiated Godhead, which is detached from all that exists, the undifferentiated ground in the soul differs from the totality of its other areas, where inner-soul interactions take place and impressions are received from outside.\nEckhart's concept of the ground of the soul as a timeless, spaceless and featureless entity imbued it with a divine quality that was absent from created things. This resulted in a significant but problematic consequence for medieval theologians: the core area of the soul is not only imperishable but also uncreated. In addition to being immortal, as was commonly assumed in the Middle Ages, the soul existed in a state of eternity before the creation of the world. In a sermon, Eckhart stated, \"I have sometimes spoken of a light that is in the soul, which is uncreated and uncreatable.\" Consequently, the ground of the soul is not a creation of God in time out of nothing and therefore subordinate to him; rather, it is eternal and unified like the Godhead itself. Eckhart explicitly referred to a \"part\" of the soul, the \"Bürglein\", which he described as \"God-like\" concerning this part and nothing else. He vouched for the truth of this statement, for which he pledged his soul. According to his understanding, the divine in the soul is fundamentally different in nature from everything in it that is created and concerns its interaction with the outside world. Given that the ground of the soul has no spatial extension, it is evident that expressions such as \"part\" or \"innermost\" are not to be understood in a spatial context and that the terms must not be \"reified\" in the interpretation. Eckhart emphasised that the ground of the soul has nothing in common with any \"things\". In contrast to Augustine's abditum mentis, Eckhart's timeless and placeless ground of the soul is not a \"thing\". It does not count as an object, cannot be categorised according to Aristotle's system of categories and is therefore, like divinity, removed from discursive thinking. Eckhart later distanced himself from the idea that the soul is composed of a created and an uncreated part. This was a false, malicious interpretation of his teaching. He did not intend to suggest that the uncreated part of the soul constituted a part of the soul itself.\nFor Eckhart, a monotheistic medieval theologian, there could only be one deity. From a philosophical perspective, it was also impossible to place anything else alongside the absolutely transcendent One. Within the framework of his concept of a strictly unified Godhead, the \"God-like\" ground of the soul could therefore not be understood as an independent being; it had to be equated with the Godhead. Consequently, divinity is present in the human soul constantly and directly. This is the ground of the soul as described by Eckhart. A new foundation and quality of humanity's relationship with the divine was established. Humankind, as a creature, cannot reach God, its Creator. According to Eckhart's conviction, the gulf between the eternal God and the transient created being is so deep that nothing created can find access to God. However, since there is an uncreated realm in the soul that differs in nothing from the Godhead, the abyss between the Creator and his work does not exist there and only there. The perfect and irrevocable unity of the Godhead with itself exists in the ground of the soul. The following applies to the \"inner world\", the \"innermost part of the spirit\": \"Here God's ground is my ground and my ground is God's ground.\" It is erroneous to conceive of God as an external entity, separate from oneself. Rather, God is to be understood as \"my own\" and as that which is within oneself. God is \"at the bottom of the soul with all his divinity\". The only remaining task for humanity is to recognise this fact and to derive the appropriate conclusions from it.\nEckhart derived far-reaching conclusions regarding the unique rank of the human soul from the unity of the soul's ground with the Godhead. He emphasised its high nobility and claimed that it stood above all creatures and even above the angels, that it was nobler than the heavens and far above them. The creatures were only traces of God and unworthy of him, that he himself worked in them, but the ground of the soul was equal to him. In the \"first touch\", in which God touches and continues to touch the uncreated and uncreatured soul, it is \"just as noble as God himself according to the touch of God\". According to Eckhart's teaching, another consequence of the uncreated nature of the soul's foundation is human freedom. Everything created is unfree. Only those people are free who orientate themselves by the ground of the soul and are thus \"seized\" by divine justice. Such an individual is no longer a servant; they do not serve either God or creatures, as this would be incompatible with their freedom, which they do not possess but \"are\". The hierarchical relationship that exists between God and creatures is negated in this context.\n\n\n==== The breakthrough to the divinity at the ground of the soul ====\nEckhart posits that the goal should not be to stop at the concept of God, but rather to \"break through\" to the Godhead. This entails transcending the level of the personal, triune God to advance to the \"one-fold\" Godhead. This breakthrough can be described as a process of \"realisation,\" although it is not necessarily perceived in the usual sense. The deity cannot be an object of cognition, neither for itself nor for others, because where a recognising subject is separated from a recognised object, there is no absolute unity, and therefore the realm of the deity remains closed. Moreover, the soul can only recognise something if it has an image of it, but all images come from outside, i.e. not from the Godhead. Consequently, the realisation of the undifferentiated deity is not possible in the normal sense; it is only possible in the realm of determinations and images. As an object that is sought by a subject, the deity is in principle unattainable, even though its existence as such is recognisable. Eckhart comments: \"The hidden darkness of the invisible light of the eternal Godhead is unrecognisable and will never be recognised.\" Although Eckhart speaks of recognising God, as was customary in the language of the time, when it comes to the deity, we can only speak of \"recognising\" in a non-essential sense, because there is no recogniser who stands in front of a recognised being.\nEckhart assigns a central role to the \"breakthrough\" in his teaching. He refers to this as the birth of God in the soul, a concept that draws upon a topos from the time of the Church Fathers. The idea is that the soul realises the divinity of its own nature and thus discovers the Godhead in its innermost being. In this process, the individual human being does not become something they were not before; rather, they realise their true nature, which is already present within them. The birth of God begins in the soul of the individual human being and extends to encompass the entirety of the soul. For Eckhart, this is the meaning and purpose of creation. Only through the birth of God in the soul does the birth of Christ through Mary take on meaning for humankind. Furthermore, the historical birth of Christ is contingent upon the birth of God in Mary's soul. The birth of God in the soul is not a punctual event that concludes, but rather a continuous process whose temporality is the \"present now\" in which the soul \"stands\". The emphasis on the processual nature of the event is a distinctive feature of Eckhart's concept. He understands the birth of God as the soul's return to the Godhead – its own primordial ground and origin. Human beings, who are closest to God, can become through divine grace what God is by nature; they are then in the greatest correspondence with the \"image that he was in God, in which there was no difference between him and God before God created the creatures\".\nWhen the soul is seized by the divine influence from its very foundation, its receptivity and passivity is revealed; it receives God. Eckhart therefore claims that human bliss does not lie in the working but in the \"suffering\" of God (an dem daz wir got lîden). He explains: \"As omnipotent as God is in working, the soul is just as abysmal in undergoing; and that is why it is moulded with God and in God.\"\nThe birth of God is brought about by God, who works in the soul, but man has to create the conditions for this. According to Eckhart's conviction, divine action is never arbitrary, but always lawful: it is a necessary consequence of the interplay between God's unchanging nature and the respective circumstances. Therefore, the birth of God in the soul happens inevitably when the conditions for it are fulfilled. It is then a natural necessity. God, who makes it possible, could not act in any other way without giving himself up. This is illustrated by the fact that \"He must do it, whether he likes it or is sorry.\"; \"God's nature, his being and his divinity depend on the fact that he must work in the soul.\" Eckhart compares God's imperative to illustrate its involuntariness with the later so-called physical \"horror vacui\", the abhorrence of emptiness, which was attributed to nature. It was assumed that nature would not tolerate an empty space, and would therefore prevent the creation of a vacuum in any given area. Eckhart's description of the self-emptying of man, who realises seclusion, suggests that this process \"forces\" God to seek out the secluded soul and pour himself into it, to prevent the formation of a \"vacuum\" within it.\nAlthough the breakthrough to the Godhead cancels out all opposites and differences and thus transcends discursive thinking, which operates with determinations, it is not an irrational process in Eckhart's view. Reason is not left behind. Rather, it constantly accompanies man, following Eckhart's demand: \"And man should use his reason attentively in all his works and in all things, and in everything have a rational awareness of himself and his inwardness.\" Concerning the birth of God, Eckhart asserts that \"knowledge and reason unite the soul with God.\" He further posits that reason penetrates the pure being, while knowledge runs ahead and breaks through. Eckhart ascribes a central role to reason in the breakthrough and an unrivalled dignity to it because he views God as pure intellect. He considers existence to be God's \"forecourt\" and reason to be his temple: \"Nowhere does God dwell more truly than in his temple, in reason.\" Eckhart employs two distinct concepts of intellect. In some instances, it is understood as one of the faculties of the soul, signifying the capacity for discursive cognition that exists outside the ground of the soul. In other contexts, it is conceived as the intellect that is in the ground of the soul and is ultimately identical to it. This latter concept is the reason that gives man non-discursive, direct access to the divine. This is the sole possible avenue of access: \"The soul has no capacity through which God could speak except reason.\"\nEckhart provides a detailed account of the conditions that must be fulfilled for the birth of God to be possible. Since it is a matter of entering into unity, everything that stands in the way of unity must be removed. Obstacles are not only sins and vices in the conventional sense, but also everything ungodly and therefore transient. This includes, in particular, the \"images\" of sensual objects that one has taken in because they bind and hinder the person. Eckhart forcefully refutes the argument put forth by Aristotelians and Thomists, who maintain that only images are inherently present in the soul and that it is its nature to perceive through the senses and in images. Consequently, they argue, the removal of all images is contrary to nature. Eckhart counters this by asserting that those who hold this view have not fully grasped the nobility of the soul. He explains that nothing hinders the soul from recognizing God as much as time and space. Time and space are \"pieces\", but God is one and can only be recognised above them. Therefore, the realisation of God is impossible as long as the soul is aware of time or space.\nEckhart provides a comprehensive account of the preparatory purification of the soul. A focus on the divine is incompatible with a will and desire that is oriented towards the world. Consequently, the initial objective is to liberate oneself from all such aspirations, to consistently disengage oneself inwardly from the terrestrial realm without neglecting the fulfilment of worldly responsibilities. Eckhart refers to the consequence of such detachment from the world as \"seclusion\". The ground of the soul is inherently secluded. Nevertheless, it is crucial to entirely separate the various aspects of the soul from \"all things\" for the individual to become void and for God to enter this void. Subsequently, the entirety of the soul may be filled by God. It is recommended that individuals should endeavour to grasp God in all things and accustom their minds to having God present at all times. Such an attitude ultimately leads to the complete divinisation of the individual. \"I am transformed into him in such a way that he works me as his being, and indeed as one, not as the same; with the living God, it is true that there is no difference whatsoever.\" Eckhart also asserts that this is about a genuine unity of the human being and God, as evidenced by the following words: Some individuals with a simplistic worldview believe that they should perceive God as if he were physically present in the immediate vicinity. This is not the case. \"God and I are one.\" This demand for unity is so radical that the idea that God should find a place to work in man must also be rejected. From Eckhart's perspective, the notion of a location for activity is predicated on the concept of a specific spiritual substance and a relationship between two entities, which is incompatible with seclusion. Rather, what is required is that the human being \"stands so unattached to God and all his works\" that God, if he wants to work in the soul, finds no place there, and thus himself be the place where to act.\nA fundamental tenet of the doctrine of the birth of God in the ground of the soul is the assertion that this process occurs directly, without any intermediary. \"This must happen without means\", Eckhart states; \"Any kind of mediation is alien to God.\" Nevertheless, according to Eckhart's interpretation, it is possible to conceptualise a form of mediation in the ground of the soul if one considers silence, the absence of images, as the mediating factor that enables the soul to find rest in God.\nEckhart provides a detailed account of the emotional aspects of turning to God in the soul. He underscores the \"great joy\" and \"immeasurable bliss\" associated with this. For those who experience this, all human suffering appears to be comparatively insignificant. The soul is imbued with a \"power\" that radiates the divine essence of God, who is \"glowing and burning without ceasing with all his richness, with all his sweetness and with all his delight\". Nevertheless, Eckhart differentiates between this experience of delight and the phenomenon of breakthrough. He postulates that this power, like all other powers, is incapable of accessing the divine essence at the ground of the soul, due to its intrinsic simplicity, which precludes the possibility of external influence.\n\n\n==== The master of life anchored in the ground of the soul ====\nEckhart's initial objective was to convey to his listeners or readers a discursively attainable insight into the truth of his philosophical and theological teachings. Nevertheless, he considered such an understanding to be of little consequence in terms of facilitating the birth of God within people. Rather, he considered the practice of life to be the determining factor in achieving seclusion. The realization was of paramount importance. To illustrate this, he employed a pun to highlight the distinction between a \"master of reading\" and a \"master of life\". In the Dominican order to which Eckhart belonged, a \"master reader\" was a monk who had undergone scientific training and was responsible for training his fellow monks in the order's education system. The lector, or reading master, delivered lectures and instructed his students in traditional doctrinal material. It seems probable that Eckhart fulfilled this role himself in Cologne. He contrasted this theoretical approach to knowledge with the work of a \"master of life\", who applied the theoretical principles they had learned in their own lives and could therefore serve as a role model. A saying attributed to Eckhart is that one master of life is more necessary than a thousand masters of reading. In this instance, he employed a rhetorical device to highlight the distinction between intellectual comprehension and internalisation. While the former can be discarded or forgotten, the latter remains constant. In light of this, he exhorted: \"Man should not have an imagined God and be satisfied with that; for when the thought passes away, the God also passes away. Rather, one should have an essential God who is far above the thoughts of man and all creatures.\"\nEckhart posits that the life of an individual who orientates himself towards the ground of the soul is fundamentally transformed, acquiring meaning and value that it would otherwise never have. The birth of God imbues all the actions of such a person with extraordinary significance. As a consequence, even the most mundane actions of such an individual are imbued with a significance that is far beyond the reach of those who have not achieved the same level of spiritual understanding. If an individual who has attained a grasp of the divine nature of God steps on a stone, this is a more divine act than if one receives the Eucharist without such an attitude. Anyone who has ever \"peered\" into the depths of their soul for just a moment, may consider a thousand marks of gold as of equal value as a false Heller. One who bestows a greater benefit upon themselves or their intimate friend than upon a person who lives beyond the sea and whom they have never seen, has never \"peered for a moment into this simple ground\".\nThis prompts the question of the distinction between an exemplary individual, a virtuous person who has mastered the art of life, and a sinner who is indifferent to the existence of God. Given that the birth of God occurs in the undetermined, and that the Godhead cannot even be described as \"good\" due to its indetermination, the ground of the soul is beyond all moral judgments. Eckhart's teachings indicate that the ground of the soul of the virtuous individual is not distinct from that of the sinner. The ground in a person's soul is unchanging by nature and is not contingent upon their actions. The moral value of an individual's actions plays no role in the divine workings of the soul. Even for those who are in hell, the nobility of nature remains unchanging. The distinction between the two groups is that in the case of good people, the divine light emanates from the ground of the soul and radiates into the \"outer\" areas of the soul, where the soul's faculties are active. In contrast, in the case of bad people, this process does not occur. Those who engage in morally reprehensible actions are unable to receive the divine light. Although Eckhart espoused the doctrine that the Godhead is devoid of action and therefore lacks the capacity for love, he nevertheless posited a relationship between the Godhead and the realm of love and ethical distinctions. This relationship is characterised by the emanation of love from the Godhead.\nAs a preacher, Eckhart placed great emphasis on the importance of conveying to his audience that the status of the righteous or master of life was not a privilege of a particularly qualified elite, but was attainable for everyone. The joy associated with complete seclusion was not a distant goal, but rather a tangible possibility. It is unlikely that any of the listeners were so coarse or so limited in their understanding or so removed from the concept of seclusion that they could not find this joy \"as it truly is\" within themselves \"even before you come out of this church today, even before I finish my sermon\".\n\n\n==== Condemnation of the doctrine ====\nIn the final years of his life, Eckhart was denounced and accused of heresy, which can be defined as a deviation from orthodoxy. The inquisition process initiated against him in Cologne was reopened at the papal court in Avignon and brought to a conclusion after his death. Pope John XXII condemned certain of Eckhart's statements as heretical and prohibited the dissemination of works containing them. In the bull In agro dominico of 27 March 1329, seventeen theses originating from Eckhart or attributed to him were classified as erroneous or heretical, while eleven others were designated as suspect. The concept of the ground of the soul, with its various aspects and consequences, constituted a central element in the attacks on his teachings.\nThe accusers and the papal court regarded the assertion that the human soul is partly uncreated as particularly offensive. The prosecution interpreted this as an assertion that the soul was composed of both created and uncreated elements, with the uncreated divine element being regarded as one of its faculties. Such an interpretation led to the conclusion that the doctrine of the presence of divinity in the soul constituted a degradation of God. This point was repeatedly highlighted in the papal list of errors. The unrestricted divinisation of the spiritual birth of God was deemed blasphemous, as it appeared to lead to the identification of a person with God. Furthermore, critics perceived this interpretation as a threat to the unique status of Christ as the only God-man. The Pope condemned the theses in question, which had been interpreted in this way. Eckhart, who did not survive to see the condemnation, defended himself against the attacks and accused his opponents of ignorance and malicious misinterpretation of his teachings.\nThe Franciscan William of Ockham (d. 1347), a vehement opponent of the Pope, accused John XXII of failing to condemn Eckhart's absurd and fantastical theses as heresies. It would appear that Ockham was unaware of the bull of condemnation. In particular, he considered assumptions related to the concept of the uncreated ground of the soul and the absolute undifferentiated nature of the Godhead to be absurd. Ockham cited Eckhart's assertions that there is no distinction (distinctio) in the realm of the divine (in divinis) and that any righteous person is transformed into the divine essence (essentia), just as the bread is transformed into the body of Christ at the Eucharist.\n\n\n=== Johannes Tauler ===\nThe Dominican Johannes Tauler (d. 1361) was one of the most renowned spiritual teachers of the late Middle Ages in the German-speaking world. He held Eckhart's teachings in high regard and drew considerable inspiration from them. One of the concepts he drew on was the ground of the soul, which he, like Eckhart, equated with the Augustinian \"hiding place of the spirit\". He translated the Latin expression abditum mentis into Middle High German as verborgen appetgrunde (\"hidden abyss\"). He preferred to characterise the innermost part of the soul as an abyss. In this context, he referred to the biblical passage Ps 42:8 EU, where the Vulgate version of the Latin Bible speaks of an abyss (abyssus) that \"calls\" (invocat) an abyss. Tauler interpreted this to signify the mutual attraction between the divine abyss and the abyss of the human soul. He frequently referenced the ground of the soul in his sermons. He designated it as the most pure, most intimate, and noblest, \"the innermost ground where alone there is unity.\" It can be posited that God could \"enter\" this state of being if the \"mind\" – the human spirit – was carried upwards. This ground is distinct from earthly realities; it is situated at a high level above the realm of spiritual powers or faculties that give life and movement to the body. It is so noble that it cannot be adequately described by any term, including the term \"floor,\" which is inadequate.\nNevertheless, Tauler employed a variety of terms to describe the ground of the soul, including \"spark\" and \"the supreme human being,\" in addition to the primary term \"ground.\" In his anthropology, Tauler posits that human beings are composed of three distinct personas: the \"animal\" person, who lives by the senses; the rational person; and the \"supreme, inner\" person, who is \"God-shaped, God-formed.\" Upon entering into itself, or its ground, the soul becomes divine and lives a divine life.\nIn a sermon, Tauler asserted that God operates within the \"innermost, most hidden, deepest foundation of the soul.\" He posited that God could not be separated from this innermost core of the soul, like he could not be separated from himself. In consequence of divine grace, the ground of the soul is endowed with all that God possesses by nature. Tauler referred to the \"pagan master\" Proclus, whom he quoted at length. Proclus had already identified that it was impossible to reach the essence of the matter by focusing on images and diversity, rather than on the One. It is regrettable that a pagan had discerned this truth and grasped it, whereas Christians were distant from it. The truth as formulated by Proclus was identical to that proclaimed in the Gospel, as evidenced by the following words: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21 EU). This implies that the kingdom of God is located within the ground, above all the effects of the powers of the soul. Tauler emphasised that there is a completely pure, undisguised and reliable recognition and awareness of the \"inner ground\" where the kingdom of God is. However, this could not be achieved through the use of natural reason; rather, it required the intervention of special grace. Tauler's teaching posits that the requisite grace is not bestowed upon the individual who has sufficiently qualified for it by an arbitrary decision of God; rather, it must be granted to him as soon as he fulfils all the requirements. Consequently, God must become the active principle in man as a consequence of his own necessity of being. The necessity of self-communication is an immanent aspect of God's nature.\nLike Eckhart, Tauler espoused the view that the unification of the soul at its ground required the elimination of all human idiosyncrasies, as these impeded the process of unification with God. A person must first withdraw into themselves, overcome diversity and make their mind simple, achieve spiritual unity through concentration and collection so that union with the simple God becomes possible. In a sermon, Tauler elucidated that the human spirit then descends into the divine abyss and becomes lost within it, such that it is unaware of its own existence; it loses its own knowledge and activity. It then \"sank into itself\" and lost itself in God, akin to a drop of water in the deep sea. Like Eckhart, Tauler perceived the journey to the ground of the soul as a return that enabled individuals to recognize that they had been in God from all eternity, before their creation as creatures. \"When he was in him, man was God in God.\"\nA fundamental distinction between Eckhart's perspective and Tauler's is that Tauler regarded the ground of the soul as a created entity. Although he regarded the ground of the soul as the place where God \"works\" in the soul or, as he put it, where the soul \"has\" God, he did not identify the ground with the Godhead. Rather, he taught that when the uncreated divine abyss meets the created human abyss, one abyss flows into the other; then \"the created nothingness sinks into the uncreated nothingness\". By emphasising the creatureliness of the ground of the soul, Tauler carefully distanced himself from possible interpretations of his statements that could have placed his spirituality in the vicinity of Eckhart's theses, which were condemned by the Church as heretical. Moreover, in contrast to Eckhart, he did not regard the ground as incorruptible; rather, he cautioned against the potential for harmful influences from created things to lead to the ground becoming entangled in evil. He urged his followers to cultivate the ground of the soul with great diligence, as a farmer would his field, and to eradicate the weeds.\nIn contrast to Eckhart, Tauler explicitly referenced his personal experience in one of his sermons. He asserted that if an individual had attained a state of spiritual purity and remained therein, they would become a divine abode, wherein God would reside. Nevertheless, he posited that such piety was beyond the capacity of the human body, which was unable to sustain it. He himself had not yet reached this stage in his own experience. Although a teacher shouldn't espouse a doctrine that he has not personally experienced, it is sufficient that he is in sympathy with it and has it in mind, and that it does not impede his own spiritual progress.\n\n\n=== Heinrich Seuse ===\nThe Dominican Heinrich Seuse (d. 1366), a disciple of Meister Eckhart, adopted the principal tenets of his concept of the ground of the soul. Nevertheless, he seldom employed the term \"ground\" to delineate the ground of the soul. He frequently employed the term \"ground of the heart,\" which, in certain instances, served to delineate the heart with particular emphasis. In his Büchlein der Wahrheit, he elucidated that the multiplicity of attributes and designations ascribed to God, including the \"Trinity\", was, in essence and in the \"basis\" (of the Godhead), a \"simple unity\". The ground represents the nature and essence of the Godhead. It is a \"silent darkness floating in\". His own work is the birthing process, which, if one were to express it in the manner of human reason, could be described as \"Godhead has swung to God\". When queried as to whether this was not the same thing, Seuse replied that God and the Godhead were indeed one, but that the Godhead did not work and give birth; only God did that. This is how one should conceive of it, as human reason requires such an \"otherness\" to be able to comprehend. Consequently, however, we are misled by our imagination, because we view the divine in a way that corresponds to the way a creature perceives it, and this is not appropriate to divine truth. In reality, it is a unified entity.\nAlthough Seuse thus indicated the limitations of reason in comprehending the divine, he emphasised the \"high nobility\" of \"reasonableness\" in the tradition of Eckhart and lauded the \"God-like\" reason of man. According to his teachings, the supreme, \"super-being\" spirit ennobled man by shining into him from his eternal divinity, and therefore God's image is \"in the rational mind, which is also eternal\". The \"silent simplicity\" of the unnamed and \"wayless\" Godhead is a living reasonableness that understands itself. Seuse employed a paradoxical formulation by Eckhart, describing the \"ground\" as \"groundless.\" This concept can be understood as an \"abysmalness\" that seems to have no ground. In this regard as well, he asserted that divine reality differs from human perception. The abyss that appears unfathomable to the creature is, in fact, \"fathomable\" (grúntlich).\nEckhart's concept of the breakthrough, as outlined by Seuse, is the powerful externalising impact into the divine \"nothing\" which is in the \"ground.\" This impact eradicates all difference, not according to being, but only according to human perception (nach nemunge únser halb). It is therefore evident that the act of union between God and humanity is perceived differently by each individual. While it may appear to abolish the difference between the two, in actuality, nothing changes. The prerequisite for this union is the taming of the soul forces, which is achieved by the serene human being. According to the doctrine of Seuse, in the ideal case, if this taming were to succeed completely, the whole universe would be revealed to the person, who would then see into himself. The union of the soul with the divinity requires a special grace, as it does not occur naturally.\n\n\n=== Nicholas of Cusa ===\nIn the 1440s, the 14th-century dispute over Eckhart's doctrine of the uncreated nature of the ground of the soul was resurrected. In 1440, the philosopher and theologian Nicholas of Cusa (Cusanus) set forth his views in his work De docta ignorantia (On Learned Ignorance), which met with vehement opposition from the Heidelberg theology professor Johannes Wenck. In 1442/43, Wenck published a pamphlet entitled De ignota litteratura (On Unknown Scholarship), in which he accused Nicholas of pantheistic heresy and irrationalism. In 1449, the accused responded with the counter-pamphlet Apologia doctae ignorantiae (Defence of Learned Ignorance). Wenck's primary target was the doctrine of the unity of opposites (coincidentia oppositorum) in the infinity of the One, as presented in De docta ignorantia. He held the conviction that this would obliterate all scientific thought, as the tenets of logic would be set aside. The guiding idea of Cusanus was derived from Eckhart. In addition, Wenck cited Eckhart's thesis, which he was only aware of from a Latin translation, that there is \"a certain castle\" in the soul, which is also called \"Fünklein\" and is so simple that even God can only contemplate this simplicity if he renounces his names and attributes. For Wenck, the doctrine of the ground of the soul was a condemnable likening of the Creator to the creature. Cusanus offered a defence of Eckhart, whom he praised and quoted, but did not question the justification of papal intervention. He considered Eckhart to be a capable thinker who held correct views, but whose sophisticated explanations were inaccessible to those uneducated and narrow-minded (such as Wenck) and could easily be misinterpreted. His works were therefore unsuitable for the general public; they should be kept under lock and key.\n\n\n== Modern times ==\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th century ===\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, expressions referring to the ground of the soul were prevalent in spiritual literature. On occasion, such terminology was employed with explicit reference to Tauler, as evidenced by the works of the Benedictine Louis de Blois (1506–1566) and the Jesuit Maximilian van der Sandt (Sandaeus, 1578–1656). The Carmelite Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) authored El castillo interior (The Inner Castle), a foundational text in her spiritual oeuvre. In this text, she describes the location of the soul where union with God occurs as the \"deepest interior,\" the \"abyss,\" and the \"essence\" of the soul, where the faculties of the soul have no influence. In its tranquil core, the soul experiences profound peace, yet simultaneously, it is susceptible to external challenges and afflictions. Teresa's explanations exhibit a striking resemblance to those of Tauler.\nJohn of the Cross (d. 1591), also a member of the Carmelite order, employed the term \"ground of the soul\" (fondo del alma) to refer to the \"centre of the soul\". In his work Llama de amor viva (Living Flame of Love), he delineated the contact and union of the soul with God, its Bridegroom. The text refers to the \"awakening\" of God \"in the centre and at the bottom\" of the soul. The ground of the soul is defined as \"its pure and innermost being\" (la pura e intima sustancia de ella). God resides there in secret as her sole Lord, in close union with her (estrechamente unido), and performs his sweet embrace with her when she has freed herself from the ungodly. He dwells not only with those who love him, but also in the depths of all souls. Were this not the case, they could not exist. However, the nature of his presence is contingent upon the individual's attitude. In the souls in which there are no images, forms or inclinations towards anything created, God dwells as in his own house; in the others, which are oriented towards worldly things, he dwells like a stranger in someone else's house. His presence at the lowest ebb of the soul is concealed, as neither the devil nor the human mind inclined to explore it is able to gain access. Those who have not yet been united with God are typically unaware of his presence in their souls.\nThe nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599–1672) placed particular emphasis on the experience of the presence of God in the soul. In addition, she delineated the ground of the soul as the abode of God, the uppermost part of the soul, and the innermost part of the soul. In her descriptions of spiritual experiences, she employed phrases such as \"I was strongly drawn into the bottom of my inner being\" and \"completely withdrawn into the ground of the soul.\" Additionally, she employed the term \"centre of the soul.\" She referred to the centre of the soul as God's dwelling place, at times equating it with the God present in the soul.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn the eighteenth century, expressions such as \"Seelengrund\" and \"Herzensgrund\" were commonly used in Pietist circles. In certain instances, the term \"ground\" was employed in a manner analogous to its usage in medieval times, signifying the \"place\" of a person's union with God, as evidenced in Gerhard Tersteegen's work. However, in other instances, the terms underwent a significant transformation, acquiring a meaning that was starkly divergent from their original connotations. Individuals began to speak of an \"evil ground\" of the heart, which was perceived as corrupt and distant from God. The terms were increasingly secularised. This development was already foreshadowed in Pietistic literature and then fully elaborated upon in the movement of sentimentalism. The concept of the soul or heart in a secular sense was defined as the seat of strong, deep and authentic feelings, for example in the sense of \"friendship of the soul\". In some instances, a religious connotation remained, albeit to varying degrees, while in others, the Christian background was entirely absent.\nIn addition, a distinct philosophical interpretation of the term emerged in Enlightenment circles during the 18th century. The ground of the soul was conceived as a domain of \"dark\" cognition, in contrast to the clear, distinct, and therefore correct cognition demanded by René Descartes. The term \"dark\" was used to describe knowledge that was based solely on simple sensory perception, without the object of knowledge being determined based on its characteristic features. In 1739, the Enlightenment philosopher Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten introduced the Latin term fundus animae (\"ground of the soul\") to describe the mental realm in which \"dark perceptions\" were located. Although Baumgarten excluded this area as an object of aesthetic analysis, he tended to evaluate darkness positively. He saw a possible enrichment in the ground of the soul, as it contained \"perfections of sensual cognition\". In his understanding, the concepts of dark and clear cognition are not mutually exclusive, but rather intertwined. The dark is involved in every human cognition of non-simple things and facts. In contrast to ignorance, which Baumgarten regarded as a purely negative phenomenon, he identified the dark knowledge that emerges from the depths of the soul as having considerable value. In 1752, Georg Friedrich Meier, a pupil of Baumgarten, posited that dark knowledge constituted the chaos within the soul, which was processed by its creative power and from which it gradually assembled all clear knowledge. Johann Georg Sulzer posited that the \"dark ideas\" constituted the unconscious causes of behaviour that was difficult to explain. In 1758, he posited that it was the \"matters hidden in the innermost part of the soul\" that caused people to act and speak inappropriately and against their own intentions.\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) posited that the ground of the soul constituted the foundation of his anthropology. In his analysis of Baumgarten's aesthetics, he posited that \"our strength as human beings lies in the ground of the soul\". Herder regarded the \"dark abyss of the human soul\" as the site where the sensations of the animal become the sensations of a human being and commingle, as it were, from afar with the soul. It is also the abyss of dark thoughts \"from which instincts, affects, pleasure and displeasure subsequently emerge\". Herder postulated that the soul is a composite entity, with the dark aspect prevailing to a greater extent. He posited that the dark was the primordial origin from which all human development was derived; human existence was determined by the coexistence of darkness and light. He made the following observation: \"The whole ground of our soul is dark ideas, the most vivid, the most, the mass, from which the soul prepares its finer ones, the strongest driving forces of our life, the greatest contribution to our happiness and unhappiness.\" Herder evaluated this finding in a positive light in the context of his concept of the development of the individual, as he believed that all clear ideas and human concepts emerged from the dark ground of the soul. In 1778, he posited that the cognitive and volitional soul is the image of the divine, striving to imprint this image on all that surrounds it. It withdraws into itself, resting as it were on itself, and is thus able to \"turn and overcome a universe\". It accomplishes its deeds with the exalted feeling of being a daughter of God. Consequently, it contemplates its own essence, perceiving the source of its faculties and accomplishments in its intrinsic darkness. Every higher degree of ability, of attention and detachment, of wilfulness and freedom can be found \"in this dark ground of the most intimate attraction and awareness of itself, its power, its inner life\".\n\n\n=== 19th and early 20th century ===\nAt the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a notable increase in interest in medieval spirituality, initially among romantically-minded laypeople and subsequently also among scholars. In the 19th century, research into late medieval spiritual literature was similarly influenced by buzzwords and ideas that have been criticised in more recent studies as problematic and sometimes misleading. Eckhart's reception was particularly affected by this phenomenon. The thesis that the innermost part of the human soul was uncreated and godlike, and the demand for the deification of man, were often categorised as pantheistic or tending towards pantheism. However, there was also opposition to this. Some statements in the pantheism controversy were linked to assessments that were influenced by the respective ideological position of the person making the judgement; confessional perspectives asserted themselves. Furthermore, the doctrine of the absolute undifferentiated nature of the deity and its equation with the innermost part of the human soul was considered \"mystical\" in the sense of a contrast to the rational way of thinking and argumentation of the scholastic scholars of the late Middle Ages.\nThe research of the Dominican Henry Denifle (1844–1905) represented a pivotal moment in the field. Denifle demonstrated that Eckhart's thought was rooted in the scholastic tradition. However, from a Thomistic perspective, he harshly criticized him as an incompetent scholastic who had partially adopted older ideas and partially held confused, \"pathological\" views. His theology, insofar as it was original, was untenable and the condemnation of his ideas by the Church was entirely justified. Cusanus had misrepresented Eckhart's position in response to Wenck's criticism. Although Eckhart was not a true pantheist, he had put forward individual pantheistic theses. Denifle responded to previous research by criticising it and accusing Protestant scholars of bias. His incisive assertion encountered some resistance from experts, yet it exerted a profound and enduring impact on research. Martin Grabmann (1875–1949), a student of Denifle, advocated his teacher's interpretation and shared his value judgement. He proceeded to align Eckhart's concept of God with Averroism, a medieval doctrine that posits the unity of the intellect. For the Averroists, this unity is universal, negating the notion of individual immortality of the soul. Notable figures who espoused a contrasting perspective were Otto Karrer (1888–1976) and Alois Dempf (1891–1982). They considered Eckhart's position, including the basic doctrine of the soul, to be consistent and justifiable within the framework of Catholicism.\nThe conventional image of Eckhart as a non-rational mystic persisted in the public consciousness and became even more entrenched in the first half of the 20th century. This was frequently associated with the notion that his comprehension of God and the soul reflected a typically German disposition and exhibited an anti-church inclination. Herman Büttner's translation of the Middle High German works into modern German played a significant role in the shaping and popularisation of an anti-Catholic image of Eckhart. The work was first published by Eugen Diederichs in 1903-1909 and had a profound and far-reaching impact. Büttner translated the works with considerable freedom, incorporating his own interpretations. His central thesis was that when individuals descend into the depths of their souls, they also experience the world's foundation, the \"one eternal foundation.\" The experience of being one with God is a state of bliss. Those who have experienced God within themselves no longer require an external mediator or saviour; the church is then perceived as superfluous. Notable intellectuals such as Julius Hart (1859–1930), Arthur Drews (1865–1935) and Leopold Ziegler (1881–1958) concurred with Büttner's perspective or espoused similar ideas.\nThe Neo-Kantian Paul Natorp (1854–1924), like many of his contemporaries, regarded the doctrine of the ground of the soul as the foundation of a \"peculiarly German worldview\". He was enthusiastic about the doctrine and saw it as an important contribution to the development of German philosophy. Natorp found Eckhart's language to be that of the discoverer, who expressed \"things never heard\" and who was not bound by any dogma or written or spoken word. For Eckhart, only that which he could affirm \"from his own innermost experience of God\" was binding. He assumed that God and the soul were in exclusive dialogue. The soul's becoming one with God was the eternal incarnation of God and at the same time humanity's becoming God. In Natorp's understanding, the \"letting go\" of everything created and even of God himself as a prerequisite for the birth of God in the human soul \"does not mean a throwing away, but rather a radical abstraction that intends nothing other than to go back to the ultimate inner point from which, like all and every division, even the ultimate opposition of God and soul is understood in the first place\". This results in the liberation from the mediating office of the church and any mediating authority, as well as from the consciousness of sin, the \"worst tormentor of the soul of medieval people\". From the doctrine of the ground of the soul follows \"an elevation of the human spirit such as has never been expressed before and could not be surpassed by anything later\".\n\n\n=== Newer research ===\n\n\n==== The role of intellect ====\nThe role of the intellect or reason is a topic that is frequently discussed in studies and debates on the grounds of the soul and one that is strongly emphasised in much of the recent research literature. In his 2010 monograph on Eckhart, Kurt Flasch notes that the doctrine of the birth of God, \"which at first sounds simple and pious, entangles the reader in philosophical premises\". Eckhart did not regard the birth of God at the bottom of the soul as a \"supernatural additional gift\" from God, but rather as a process intrinsic to the nature of the soul. Flasch posits that Eckhart equated the nature of the soul with the intellect, thereby providing a philosophical answer to the question of what is the highest in the soul. He was convinced that the intellect was capable of recognizing the fundamental nature of the soul, \"namely itself\". This approach had often been overlooked, which had led to misinterpretations. In particular, Flasch criticised the view of the renowned Germanist Josef Quint (1898–1976), who undertook the critical editing of Eckhart's sermons and their translation into modern German. Until the 1970s, Quint held a dominant position in the field through the publication of text editions and interpretations, which contributed to the perpetuation of an erroneous irrationalist interpretation. In essence, Eckhart as a philosopher placed particular emphasis on his claim that he spoke following natural reason, that is to say, that he did not presuppose any beliefs in his arguments. In his vernacular sermons on the birth of God, he also sought to persuade his audience through rational arguments, rather than by appealing to the authority of the Bible.\nIn contrast, Otto Langer offers a distinct perspective. He asserts that an attempt to comprehend the doctrine of the ground of the soul through the lens of a theory of the intellect is misguided. Rather, the correct understanding can be gained from ethical practice. Eckhart posited that the correct form of self-love is to be found in the concept of \"humanity,\" which he defined as the essence of the human condition. He further asserted that the correct form of love for one's neighbour is to be found in the concept of \"humanity\" in others. Eckhart's teachings imply that a person who lives in accordance with their nature, or \"humanity,\" is one with God. In loving one's fellow human being, the individual is able to perceive the potential for union with the divine at the core of their being.\n\n\n==== The question of personal experience ====\nThe question of whether there is a personal experience behind Eckhart's statements about the birth of God at the ground of the soul, and in what sense such an experience should be interpreted, is answered differently. From the absence of any commentary on this matter, previous researchers have concluded that his works set out a \"spiritual mysticism\" that was not based on the author's own experience. Kurt Ruh offered a counterargument to this hypothesis. He reached the conclusion that both the content of Eckhart's teachings about the ground of the soul and how he expressed himself \"in an emphatic-charismatic manner of speaking\" presupposed personal experience. Moreover, Eckhart made a veiled confession of such experience. It is therefore necessary to understand his affirmations of truth in this sense. Shizuteru Ueda and Peter Reiter expressed similar opinions.\nAlois M. Haas approached this question from a distinct vantage point. He maintained that it was erroneous to describe the \"mystical experience that Eckhart is said to have had\". This overlooks the fact that such an expression does not do justice to Eckhart's understanding of the relationship between eternity and time. With him, the category of the new is taken out of the realm of the experiential. The term \"breakthrough\" is open to misinterpretation when translated into the categorical realm of human experience. Eckhart was not preoccupied with isolated individual experiences of God or experiences of union with God. Rather, the breakthrough consisted in the revelation of humanity's oneness with God as a fundamental human concept. Eckhart's approach was characterised by a \"lack of interest in all forms of psychological concretisation\". For him, isolated, punctual experience as the perception of an object or a mental event as a present one fell under the category of \"property\", and was therefore one of the things whose elimination was a prerequisite for the birth of God. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to describe the breakthrough as an \"experience\" if one does not misunderstand this term in a psychological sense.\nErwin Waldschütz's position is analogous. He assumed that Eckhart himself had engaged in a process of introspection, which could be understood as a \"ground experience\" rather than a vision of God in the sense of an esoteric act. He was not concerned with the individual experiences of the senses or the mind, but rather with the concept of experience itself, in its most fundamental sense. This is a \"completely independent mode of human self-expression\" that can be clearly distinguished from cognition, volition, feeling and perception and is capable of justifying the other modes of self-expression. The fundamental characteristics of the basic experience are affectivity and incorporation, inaccessibility, lack of wisdom, openness to the whole and to every person, commitment and the urge for interpretation and communication.\nBernard McGinn posited that for Eckhart, constant oneness with God was not an \"experience\" in the conventional sense of the term, nor was it an act of knowing \"something.\" Instead, it represented a novel mode of knowing and acting. This occurs when an individual attempts to relate all their actions to the unified identity of the ground.\n\n\n==== The question of individuality and subjectivity ====\nThe question of the role that can be attributed to the individual and the individuated in Eckhart's philosophy, given the absolute undifferentiated nature of his Godhead and Seelengrund, is a matter of contention in recent research. One school of thought, which includes Kurt Flasch, Burkhard Mojsisch, Loris Sturlese and Saskia Wendel, interprets the doctrine of the ground of the soul as an expression of the idea of the subject. In such interpretations, Eckhart is sometimes credited with an understanding of subjectivity that makes his concept appear to be a precursor of modern transcendental philosophy. Other researchers (Alois Haas, Otto Langer, Niklaus Largier) are unequivocally opposed to the subject-theoretical interpretation and consider it to be entirely misguided.\nBurkhard Mojsisch presents his subject-theoretical interpretation clearly and concisely. He aims to challenge the conventional view that a philosophical theory of the self was absent from the theorists of the Middle Ages, with Eckhart serving as a pivotal figure in this regard. Eckhart addresses the self as such, that is, the person insofar as they are nothing other than the self, free from any commonality with others, including God, that determines the self as self. The subject of Eckhart's theory is the self-development of a transcendental self, which is free from any presupposition and self-founded. It is constituted by the freedom of its self-determination. The self, which exists in the concrete reality of individuality, is aware of and desires only itself as a self. It is identical with the ground of the soul. Saskia Wendel largely aligns with Mojsisch's findings. Wendel posits that Eckhart's demand for reflexive self-knowledge as a gathering within and sinking into the ground of the soul presupposes what modern philosophy considers to be the subject. His realisation of the absolute can be described as an intellectual view in the sense of the idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte. For Fichte, the intellectual view was nothing other than the realisation of the absolute self. This was inevitably linked to the idea of the subject, not only in Fichte's work but already in Eckhart's work. The fundamental tenet of the soul does not result in the dissolution of the individual, but rather in their independence and singularity. This is maintained because the human self is the condition for the uniqueness and particularity of the individual. Consequently, the salvation of individuality is contingent upon the subjectivity of the individual, which is expressed in the \"I\".\nMojsisch's interpretation was subjected to vehement criticism by Otto Langer and Alois Haas. Langer asserts that Eckhart lacks a comprehensive theory of the self. He does not employ the term \"I\" in the sense of a theory of intellect, but rather in a functional manner. The concept of the ground of the soul should not be interpreted as synonymous with the self. Alois Haas considers the definition of the ego as a transcendental being to be a \"grotesque over-interpretation\" of Eckhart's statements. Individuality was not a subject of his thinking; rather, it was a presupposed obstacle which he sought to remove. He pursued the systematic destruction of the self. For him, the concept of human autonomy was only conceivable in the context of being one with God. It is not permissible to reinterpret divine autonomy as human autonomy, as is often done in more recent research on Eckhart. Haas considers Eckhart's concept of the soul's ground or soul spark to be a radical concept of the creature's absolute dependence on God, \"which hardly allows the creature the chance of ontological independence\". Eckhart's espousal of the doctrine of the absolute equality of man and God and his exposition of it from a variety of perspectives renders him a figure of great normative significance in the domain of spiritual life. Erwin Waldschütz also rejects the intellectual-theoretical interpretation of the \"ground\". He rejects the interpretation of the birth of God as the condition of the possibility of the self, which he considers to be a \"degrading\" interpretation. Eckhart sought to transcend any assertion of a self, regardless of its subtlety. He did not assume any identity between the fundamental being of God and that of man or the soul in terms of being; the reason could not be grasped in terms of being. Rather, the ground-being is a being-in-relation and relationship-creating entity. Identity is demonstrated to be the sameness of the relationship, which is only ever realised in an event.\nKarl Heinz Witte posits that Eckhart did not regard the individual as an accidental and inconsequential entity. The birth of God is always contingent upon the existence of a specific individual. For Eckhart, the concept of salvation or righteousness is not an objective reality, but rather something that is attained individually. The outcome is contingent upon the individual in question. This, however, is \"not a quiddity that I have or am predicatively\", nor an empirical self with its personal characteristics and history. For Eckhart, this belongs to the created and therefore the void. Rather, it is about the concept of \"I\" as a pure, attributeless, eternal being, or rather, as \"my is,\" a non-ontological \"is\" or \"I\".\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Overviews ===\nHeidrich, Peter (1995). \"Seelengrund\".

        "content": "Andrés Calero Bilbao (16 October 1906 – 23 January 1967) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Athletic Bilbao, Deportivo Alavés, and Levante FC.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAndrés Calero was born on 16 October 1906 in Erandio, Biscay. He began playing football in 1925 in his hometown club CD Acero, where he stood out as a forward. His good performance eventually drew the attention of Athletic Bilbao, who signed him in the summer of 1927, making his debut against Barakaldo CF on 2 October, which ended in a 2–3 loss. In total, he scored 14 goals in 25 official matches for Bilbao. In 1929, he joined Deportivo Alavés, then in the Segunda División, where together with the likes of Manuel Olivares, Luis Urquiri, and Jacinto Quincoces under coach Francisco Baonza, he was part of the Alavés side that won league and achieved promotion to La Liga, which had just been founded in 1929. Before leaving Alavés, he still played two leagues matches for them in the first division.\nIn 1930, Calero was signed by Arenas de Getxo, with whom he played for two seasons, with the highlight of his stint there coming on 4 January 1931, when he scored once to help his side to a historic 5–0 trashing of FC Barcelona. Later that year, on 29 November 1931, he again netted once against Barcelona, this time at Les Corts to help his side to a 2–2 draw. In total, Calero scored 15 goals in 36 matches in La Liga for Bilbao, Alavés, and Arenas.\nCalero spent the rest of his career in the Segunda División, playing for the likes of CD Logroño (1932–34), Levante UD (1934–36), and Gimnástico FC.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nValencia CF\nSegunda División:\n\nWinners (2) 1929–30\n\n\n== References ==",

The Garrison is responsible for the defense of the city of Beijing, the protection of all the state institutions in the capital, military mobilization in case of war, and civilian-military relations. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Beijing Garrison District was created from the old Beijing Military Region in August of 2016, as part of the 2015 reforms. Due to the importance of the capital, and the sensitivity of its military affairs, the garrison was given its own military district, distinct to the Central Theater Command, and was placed directly under the control of the Central Military Commission. \nAnother peculiarity, only shared with the Xinjiang Military District, is that Beijing units preserved their traditional division/regiment structure rather than become brigades as elsewhere in the PLA.\n\n\n== Subordinate Units ==\nAs of 2022, the Beijing Garrison District controlled the following units:\n17th Guards Regiment (警卫第十七团)\n1st Guards Division (警卫第一师) Stationed at Fuxing Road, Haidian District\n3rd Guards Regiment (警卫第三团)\n4th Guards Regiment (警卫第四团)\n5th Guards Regiment (警卫第五团)\n6th Guards Regiment (警卫第六团)\nBeijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion (仪仗大队)\n3rd Guards Division  (警卫第三师) Stationed in Tongzhou District\n11th Guards Regiment (警卫第十一团) \"Tiger Regiment\"\n13th Guards Regiment (警卫第十三团)\n14th Guards Regiment (警卫第十四团)\n15th Guards Regiment (警卫第十五团)\nArtillery Regiment (炮兵团)\nAnti-Aircraft Regiment (高炮团)\nSupport Regiment (支援保障团)\n\n\n== Citations ==",

The distance to HD 37320 is calculated at 285.5 parsecs (931 light-years), based on a parallax from Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitude of the star is 5.852, which is above the limiting magnitude for naked-eye vision (6.5m), making it faintly visible to the naked eye.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIt is an evolved blue giant star with a spectral type of B8III. It radiates about 219 times the solar luminosity by its photosphere at an effective temperature of 12,300 K. Its uniform disk angular diameter is measured at 0.153 milliarcseconds. At the estimated distance by Gaia EDR3, it yields a physical size of 4.696 R☉. The star has a mass of 5.644 M☉ and rotates under its own axis at a speed of 25 km/s.\nHD 37320 is located within the constellation Orion, based on its astronomical coordinates. The distance to the star is 285.5 parsecs (931 light-years), based on a parallax of 3.5025 mas from Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitude of the star, i.e. its brightness as seen from Earth, is of 5.852m, which is above the limiting magnitude for naked-eye vision, generally defined as 6.5m, making it faintly visible to the naked eye. The absolute magnitude of HD 37320, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at 10 parsecs (32.6 ly), is -1.43. It is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 20.1 km/s.\nHD 37320 is the Henry Draper Catalogue designation for this star. Other designations include HR 1920 from the Bright Star Catalogue, HIP 26487 from the Hipparcos Catalogue and BD+07 953 from the Bonner Durchmusterung catalogue. \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tasio is a 1984 Spanish drama film directed by Montxo Armendáriz in his full-length debut and produced by Elías Querejeta. Garikoitz Mendigutxia, Isidro José Solano, and Patxi Bisquert star as the title character, a charcoal burner and poacher, at different times in his life. The film became a staple of Basque cinema.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot follows the life of Tasio, a poacher and charcoal burner moved by a deep conviction of living without being exploited.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nInspired by the real story of Anastasio Ochoa Ruiz, \"Tasio\" (1916–1989), the screenplay was penned by Montxo Armendáriz alongside Marisa Ibarra. An Elías Querejeta PC production, the film was fully shot in Spanish rather than Basque. This decision stirred criticism among some Basque milieus. Filming locations included the Urbasa range in Navarre.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered on 19 September 1984 at the 32nd San Sebastián International Film Festival.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was enthusiastically received by the public and critics alike.\nDiego Galán of El País described Tasio as a \"film of haunting beauty\".\nNina Darnton of The New York Times pointed out that the film \"is undramatic and basically uneventful, but it is never boring\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 1984\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A notebook computer or notebook was historically a laptop whose length and width approximate that of letter paper (8.5 by 11 inches or 220 by 280 millimetres).\nThe term notebook was coined to describe slab-like portable computers that had a letter-paper footprint, such as Epson's HX-20 and Tandy's TRS-80 Model 100 of the early 1980s. The popularity of this form factor waned in the middle of the decade, as larger, clamshell-style laptops offered far more capability. In 1988, NEC's UltraLite defined a new category of notebook: it achieved IBM PC compatibility, making it technically as versatile as the largest laptops, while occupying a letter-paper footprint in a clamshell case. A handful of computer manufacturers followed suit with their own notebooks, including Compaq, whose successful LTE achieved full feature parity with laptops and spurred many others to produce their own notebooks. By 1991, the notebook industry was in full swing.\nNotebooks and laptops occupied distinct market segments into the mid-1990s, but customer preference for larger screens led to notebooks converging with laptops in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably, irrespective of physical dimensions, with laptop being the more common term in English-speaking territories.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe terms laptop and notebook both trace their origins to the early 1980s, coined to describe portable computers in a size class smaller than the contemporary mainstream units (so-called \"luggables\") but larger than pocket computers. The etymologist William Safire traced the origin of laptop to some time before 1984; the earliest attestation of laptop found by the Oxford English Dictionary dates to 1983. The word is modeled after the term desktop, as in desktop computer. Notebook, meanwhile, emerged earlier in 1982 to describe Epson's HX-20 portable, whose dimensions roughly correspond to a letter-sized pad of paper.: 9 \n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1980s, notebooks and laptops came to represent differing form factors of portable computer in the technology press, with notebooks possessing simplified hardware and a slab-like appearance with exposed keyboard (typified by the HX-20 and the TRS-80 Model 100); and laptops possessing more advanced hardware and a clamshell case to protect the keyboard. These early notebooks were all but discontinued by 1987, with laptops gaining favor due to their increased versatility.\n\n \nBy this point, however, laptops were gaining hardware features faster than the industry could miniaturize their parts, leading to very heavy laptops—some upwards of 20 pounds (9.1 kg).: 16  In October 1988, NEC released the UltraLite, the first notebook-sized clamshell laptop compatible with the IBM PC. The term notebook was promptly revived by journalists to describe the new class of laptop that the UltraLite had invented.: 16  Competitors soon came out with competing models, and while initial entries like the UltraLite made concessions in terms of data storage compatibility, Compaq's LTE line of notebooks in 1989 was the first to have full feature parity with the heaviest laptops of the time and jumpstarted the industry for these new notebooks, with scores of other manufacturers announcing their own notebooks. In direct response to Compaq,: 59 : 75  both Apple and IBM, top players in the computer industry, made their hotly anticipated entries in the notebook market in 1991, respectively, with the PowerBook and the PS/2 Note (a predecessor to the ThinkPad). Under the aegis of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, dozens of Taiwanese computer manufacturers formed a consortium to mass manufacture notebook computers starting in 1991. These Taiwanese notebook computers soon flooded the West, bringing the cost of notebooks down on the low end of the market.\nLaptops and notebooks continued to occupy discrete market segments into the mid-1990s, with unit sales tracked separately by research firms such as Dataquest. Notebooks were seen as having a footprint exactly that of or smaller than letter paper (8.5 by 11 inches or 22 by 28 centimetres), while laptops were larger. This distinction was considered important to business buyers, whose attaché cases often had a compartment exactly that size. An additional distinction was weight, with 8 pounds (3.6 kg) a loose upper limit for what journalists would consider a \"notebook\" in the press. Aside from size and weight considerations, notebooks were also seen as more sleek and stylish than the bulkier laptops. Compared to notebooks, however, laptops saw quicker improvements in processing speed and memory; featured better upgradability; and were less easy to steal. In addition, the earliest notebooks had monochrome-only LCDs, whereas laptops had color LCDs since 1989 (with NEC's ProSpeed CSX). Others still preferred laptops for their keyboards, which featured fuller-sized layouts and often superior build quality; journalists evaluated the keyboard poorly in most early notebooks.\nThe year 1991 saw the first notebooks with color displays, as well as the emergence of subnotebooks, which occupy a size class in between notebooks and palmtop PCs. By late 1992, the higher-end notebooks had run into the same miniaturization issues that laptops had encountered in the 1980s, with some notebooks weighing as much as 14 pounds (6.4 kg).\nStarting in 1997, screen sizes in notebook computers began increasing rapidly, fueled by consumer preference toward larger displays over compactness. The emergence of LCD panels larger than 12.1 inches diagonally in early 1997 led to the breaking of the 8.5-by-11-inch size barrier. By 1999, portable manufacturers had started integrating 13-, 14-, and even 15-inch LCD panels on their notebooks. Ergonomic considerations, as well the integration of pointing devices such as touchpads, also necessitated increasing the size of laptops to accommodate a larger palm rest area. These developments led to the distinction between and laptops and notebooks becoming blurred by the early 2000s. In English-speaking territories, laptop is now the more common term to describe any clamshell portable computer—notebook-sized or otherwise—likely because of the lack of ambiguity with actual paper notebooks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDynabook\nNetbook\nSmartbook\nUltrabook\nMobile workstation\nPizza-box form factor\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Notebooks\" (1992), episode of Computer Chronicles at the Internet Archive",

        "content": "Valley Stream Brook (more commonly known as Valley Stream) is a stream on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nValley Stream runs between Franklin Square and Hook Creek, ultimately emptying into Jamaica Bay. The creek begins in Franklin Square, flowing towards the south, west, and southwest to Hook Creek in Woodmere.\nValley Stream eventually reaches its southern terminus at its confluence with Hook Creek, just south of Rosedale Road. From there, the water from Valley Stream continues down Hook Creek, eventually reaching Jamaica Bay.\nCommunities which Valley Stream Brook passes through include Franklin Square, North Valley Stream, Valley Stream, South Valley Stream, and Woodmere in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County – in addition to touching the Rosedale section of the New York City borough of Queens at its confluence with Hook Creek.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1850s, Valley Stream's water was used in providing the CIty of Brooklyn with its public drinking water.\nIn the late 1980s, portions of Valley Stream and its tributaries (such as Clear Stream and Mill Brook) began to dry up, leading to restoration efforts being undertaken. This included the construction of a new dam.\nThe stream is the namesake of North Valley Stream, South Valley Stream, and the Village of Valley Stream.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeography of Long Island\nMotts Creek (Nassau County, New York)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Bayard Lister (July 4, 1898 – May 14, 1951) was an American firearms expert who was an officer of the National Rifle Association of America from 1926 to 1951.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLister was born on July 4, 1898, in Wilmington, Delaware to James W. and Florence (Carson) Lister. He became involved in sports shooting while a member of the Boy Scouts of America. After graduating from Wilmington High School, he worked under Kellogg Casey in the sales and promotions department of DuPont. In 1917, Lister joined the United States Army and remained there until the end of World War I. On October 22, 1919, he married Lynette Harper. They had one daughter.\n\n\n== National Rifle Association ==\nIn 1921, Lister moved to Washington D.C. to become the advertising and promotion manager of the National Rifle Association. He recommended expanding NRA membership outside the United States Armed Forces and state militias and under his leadership, membership grew from 3,500 in 1921 to over 10,000 in 1925.\nIn 1926, he became the organization's secretary–treasurer and led a drive that increased membership to 350,000 by 1945. He also served as editor of the NRA's monthly magazine, the American Rifleman, was a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and edited the sections on rifles and marksmanship in Webster's International Dictionary. He was a leader in the fight against laws restricting firearm ownership, but did support some gun control measurers, including the National Firearms Act and the Federal Firearms Act of 1938.\nDue to a prior bout of tuberculosis, Lister was rejected for active military service during World War II. He instead served as the national coordinator of rifle shooting in the Office of Civilian Defense. He also helped draft the first manual on home guard organization.\nIn 1949, Lister succeeded the retiring Milton Reckord as executive director of the NRA. He died of brain cancer on May 14, 1951, at the Washington Sanitarium. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nFollowing his death, a memorial trophy was presented. Since 1952 it has been awarded for the National Indoor Sectional-National Smallbore Rifle Champion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ryoko Kui (九井諒子, Kui Ryōko) is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known for her manga series Delicious in Dungeon (2014–2023), serialized in Enterbrain's seinen manga magazine Harta. As well as her work Terrarium in Drawer, winning the Excellence Award in the Manga Division at the 17th Japan Media Arts Festival.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKui posted her early works on Pixiv and COMITIA before making her official debut as a mangaka in March 2011 with her short story collection Ryuu no Gakkou wa Yama no Ue Kui Ryouko Works (Japanese: 竜の学校は山の上 九井諒子作品集, romanized: Ryū no gakkō wa Yamanoue Kui Ryōko Sakuhin-shū). Prior to this, she published a webcomic on her personal blog named UORIR: Amble (UORIR: アンブル編 (UORIR: Anburu-hen)) which ran from 2008-2012.\nIn 2013, Kui won the Excellence Award in the Manga Division at the 17th Japan Media Arts Festival for her work Terrarium in Drawer.

Delicious in Dungeon received an anime adaptation in 2024, with Kui noted as being \"very involved\" with its production.\n\n\n== Style ==\nKui's style is noted for its portrayal of reality and fantasy with her unique point of view. Megumi Sakamoto writing for Comic Natalie described her characteristic style as embodying 違和感, \"unnaturalness\". Kui was noted in an interview with Comic Natalie to have an affinity with dragons, and has had dragons featured in several of her works.\nPrior to Delicious in Dungeon, Kui read The Neverending Story and The Lord of the Rings, as well as researching the rulebooks of Dungeons & Dragons after having seen it arise several times for her research prior to the manga's serialization.

Upon her graduation in 2015, Karanja became the second female neurosurgeon in Kenya.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKaranja was born in Nairobi and raised in Kikuyu, Kenya. She attended Consolata Primary School before continuing her education at Precious Blood High Riruta. \nInfluenced by the HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns of the early 1990s, she studied medicine at the University of Nairobi, where she earned her medical degree. After completing her internship, Karanja shifted her focus from internal medicine, which heavily involved HIV/AIDS, to the field of surgery.  She spent five years in Durban, South Africa while completing her masters in neurosurgery at KwaZulu-Natal University.\nKaranja currently serves as a Consultant Neurosurgeon at Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya. \nShe is a member of neurosurgical and medical societies in Kenya and abroad. She is the current Treasurer of the Kenya Association of Women Surgeons (KAWS).\nShe also teaches as an adjunct lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Nairobi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Astronomical Observatory of Kazan University is a Russian astronomical observatory located in the city of Kazan at an altitude of 75 meters above sea level. It exists on the basis of the Department of Astronomy of Kazan University, founded in 1810 by Joseph Johann von Littrow. Object of cultural heritage of Russia of federal significance. On September 19, 2023, the observatory was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Department of Astronomy of the Imperial Kazan University was founded in 1810 by Joseph Johann Litrow. On November 11, 1814, observations began at a small observatory (temporary construction) above a stone gatehouse in the university botanical garden. In 1822 the observatory was temporarily placed in a wooden gallery (part of I. M. Simonov's apartment). In 1827 the university yard was chosen as the permanent place of the observatory, and in 1833 the construction of the observatory building began. In 1835 a 23-cm (9-inch) refractor was ordered from Fraunhofer's workshop.\nIn 1837 the permanent observatory building was completed, and in June of that year the first observations were made in it. In 1838, a 9-inch refractor was installed in the fully movable main tower. The official date of birth of the University Astronomical Observatory was April 13, 1838, when permanent observations (on the Vienna Meridian Circle) began in the new observatory building.\nOn February 23, 1885, a time service was established: a clock showing the exact Kazan mean time was exhibited in the window of the department.\nFrom 1925 to 1946, along with the Department of Astronomy, there was the Department of Geodesy, from 1937 called the Department of Geodesy and Gravimetry. It was headed at different times by K. K. Dubrovsky (1925–1931), A. A. Yakovkin (1931–1937), I. A. Dyukov (1937–1941), A. D. Dubyago (1941–1946). The Department of Astronomy since the late 30s was called the Department of Astrometry (heads V. A. Baranov (1937–1941), I. A. Dyukov (1941–1947)).\nIn addition, from 1939 to 1947 and then from 1951 to 1954 there was the Department of Astrophysics under the direction of D. Y. Martynov, and since 1945 - the Department of Theoretical Astronomy under the direction of A. D. Dubyago. In 1947, due to the insufficient number of students, four astronomy departments were merged into one - the Department of Astronomy under the general direction of Prof. I. A. Dyukov/\nOn May 4, 1983, in Kazan, V. Kapkov made a successful observation of the occultation of an 8.6 magnitude star by asteroid 2 Pallas. This was the first reliable observation of an asteroid occulting a star on the territory of Russia and the fourth within the borders of the USSR.\nOn September 19, 2023, the observatory was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\n== References ==",

For instance, Shabri was a devoted follower of Ram, while Kalidas was a devotee of Kali. On the other hand, Andh Bhakt is a term formed by combining \"Andh\" meaning blind, and \"Bhakt\" meaning devotee or follower.\nDespite \"Andh Bhakt\" meaning being \"Blind Follower\", this word is still used as a counter to the most hard hitting facts.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "André Bellon was a French footballer who played as a defender for Lyon in the mid-1910s. He is best known for playing in the first-ever Coupe de France final in 1918, which Lyon lost.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAndré Bellon was born in France to Philippe André Auguste Bellon (1849–1918), a native of Molines-en-Queyras, and Elisabeth Anne Marie Berge. He had an older brother who was dead at birth in 1884, while André was born either in the late 1880s or early 1890s. A relative of his, Louis Bellon (1908–1998), was an artist who went on to became a member of the Salon du Sud-Est (Salon of the South-East), one of the most prestigious arts organizations of Lyon where many important contemporary artists exhibited.\nVery little is known about his life; Bellon was playing football for Lyon in the 1917–18 season. In the second round replay of the 1917–18 Coupe de France against AS Lyonnaise on 18 November, he scored an equalizer in terrible weather conditions to force another replay played a week later in which Lyon won 5–0. In the quarterfinals, Lyon faced Stade Rennais on neutral ground in Paris on 3 February 1918, and he once again netted an equalizer in the second half in an eventual 2–1 win. He thus contributed decisively in helping his side reach the 1918 Coupe de France final, the competition's first-ever final, which they lost 0–3 to Olympique Pantin.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFC Lyon\n\nCoupe de France:\nRunner-up: 1917–18\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blau-Weiß Brühl (officially known as Fußballclub Blau-Weiß Brühl 1949 e.V.) was a football club from the town of Brühl in the Rhineland region of Germany. The club's first team participated in the DFB-Pokal in 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe football club was founded in 1949 and for many decades played at the district level. In 2000, the club achieved promotion to the district league for the first time, followed by a rapid ascent to the Landesliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein League). In 2001, under the guidance of coach Nissim Beniesch, Blau-Weiß Brühl reached the final of the Mittelrheinpokal (Mittelrhein Cup) and defeated the reserves of Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the process. On May 24, 2001, they won the final against Borussia Freialdenhoven with a score of 3–2. This made the team the first seventh-tier club to qualify for the DFB-Pokal 2001/02. In the DFB-Pokal, Blau-Weiß Brühl, now playing at the sixth-tier level due to their previous promotion, faced Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern and lost 1–4 after initially taking a 1–0 lead in front of approximately 6,000 spectators.\nSubsequently, Blau-Weiß Brühl achieved another promotion to the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein Association League) in the league competition. However, in the 2002/03 season, the team narrowly avoided relegation, and a year later, they finished in last place and were relegated back to the Landesliga. The merger of TuRa Hennef with FC Geistingen to form FC Hennef 05 prevented Brühl from being relegated to the Bezirksliga. Nonetheless, they were eventually relegated to that league in 2006 due to sporting reasons. With the absence of sporting success and further relegations to the Kreisliga A and Kreisliga B in 2008, Blau-Weiß Brühl also lost important players and officials.\nIn the 2008/09 season, the team was withdrawn from competitive play and the club was ultimately dissolved. This development was facilitated by the simultaneous success of local rivals SC Brühl 06/45, who achieved promotion to the fifth-tier Mittelrheinliga in 2008.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nWinner of the Middle Rhine Cup in 2001\n\n\n== Notable personalities ==\nFuat Kılıç\nWolodymyr Ljutyj\nMohamed Azima\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "China Basin Park is a 5-acre (2.0 ha) park in San Francisco, California, located at the mouth of Mission Creek in the Mission Bay neighborhood and across from the Oracle Park baseball stadium. The park features a hilly lawn, dog run, artificial beach, amphitheater seating, and a statue of Willie McCovey. A section of the Bay Trail runs through it.\nThe park is not operated by the San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department but rather falls under the jurisdiction of the Port of San Francisco. After 15 years of planning in conjunction with the Mission Rock development, the park opened to the public before the San Francisco Giants' home opening game on April 5, 2024, and had an official grand opening several weeks later on April 25.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The flag of the state of Pará is, along with the coat of arms and the anthem, one of the symbols of the state of Pará, Brazil as described in article 12 of the state constitution.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne day after joining the nation of Brazil on November 16, 1889, as well as in its initial years, the flag of the Clube Republicano Paraense appeared as the state flag. Written by Philadelpho de Oliveira Condurú, it was described as follows:\nBandeira partida em pala, de vermelho, branco, vermelho com uma estrela azul no centro.\nOn April 10, 1890, the Municipal Council, on the proposal of its president, Artur Índio do Brasil, approved a project making the club's badge the flag of the municipality of Belém.\nOn June 3, 1890, a bill to make the flag official was presented by deputy Higino Amanajás in the State Chamber. Its content was as follows:\n\nThe Legislative Congress of the State of Pará decrees:\nArt. 1 - The Flag of the State of Pará is considered to be the one that served as a badge for the Clube Republicano Paraense, before the proclamation of the Republic, and which in a session on April 10, 1890 was adopted as the Flag of the Municipality.\n\nArt. 2 — Provisions to the contrary are renewed.Ribeiro records that the project was never made official, being rejected in the senate, inspired by Governor Augusto Montenegro, on the grounds that all Brazilians should have the Brazilian flag as their only flag.\nThe current design of the flag, which was used as a reference in the creation of the official coat of arms in 1903, is composed as follows: a red rectangle with an oblique white stripe, running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, and a blue star in the center of the flag.\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\n\nThe white stripe in the Flag of Pará represents the zodiac, the Equator and the Amazon River. The blue star is Spica in the constellation Virgo, which is also depicted on the Flag of Brazil representing the state. The two red areas symbolize the blood shed by the Cabanos in the Cabanagem revolt.\nThe star symbolizes the state, which on the national flag corresponds to Espiga, the alpha star of the first magnitude in the constellation Virgo. In the Brazilian pavilion, it is the only star above the banner with the banner \"Order and Progress\" because, at the time of the proclamation of the Republic, it was the state whose capital, Belém, was the northernmost in the country. Another statement as to why the star is lonely was because the state was the last province to accept Brazil's independence from Portugal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Liu Gongren (Chinese: 劉宮人; lit. 'Palace Lady Liu'; ? ― ?) was a concubine of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty in China. She was the mother of Emperor Gaozong's eldest son, Li Zhong, who later became the crown prince of the Tang dynasty. Despite her low birth, her son became the crown prince. It was rare for a prince of such low birth, the son of a palace maid, to be appointed crown prince.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWhile Lady Liu's personal background and the circumstances surrounding her entry into the imperial palace remain unclear, historical records indicate that she was a palace maid of Prince Li Zhi (later Emperor Gaozong) and held the title of \"concubine\" (fei), a rank within the imperial harem.\nIn the year 643 CE, during the 17th year of the Zhenguan reign, shortly after ascending to the position of crown prince, Li Zhi had his first son with her, Li Zhong. Emperor Taizong, the reigning emperor and Li Zhi's father, expressed his elation by declaring, \"Upon receiving this grandson, I want to share the joy with everyone,\" and he was so happy that he started dancing.\nFollowing the birth of her son, Lady Liu's presence in historical records fades away. There is no mention of whether she received any further titles or honors after Emperor Gaozong's ascension to the throne.\nIn the absence of a male heir, Empress Wang, Emperor Gaozong's empress, faced pressure to secure the succession. Her uncle, the chancellor Liu Shi, suggested adopting Li Zhong as the crown prince because Lady Liu came from a lowly background, and Liu Shi hoped Li Zhong would be close to Empress Wang. Thus, Li Zhong was made the crown prince. This proposal likely stemmed from Liu Shi's hope that Li Zhong's elevation would strengthen his own position and influence within the court. Later, after Emperor Gaozong deposed Empress Wang and established his concubine Wu Zetian as empress, Li Zhong was demoted to the Prince of Liang. However, due to political maneuvering and favoritism, Emperor Gaozong eventually designated his third son, Li Hong, as the crown prince and successor to the throne.\n\n\n== In media ==\nPortrayed by Jian Lifang in 1985 Chinese drama The Empress of the Dynasty\nPortrayed by Cui Bing in 2014 Chinese drama The Empress of China\n\n\n== References ==",

He was turned into a dolphin by the god.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nThe following account from Hyginus tells the myth about Aethalides and the rest of the crew:\"When the Tyrrhenians, later called Tuscans, were on a piratical expedition, Father Liber [i.e. Dionysus], then a youth, came on their ship and asked them to take him to Naxos. When they had taken him on and wished to debauch him because of his beauty, Acoetes, the pilot, restrained them, and suffered at their hands. Liber, seeing that their purpose remained the same, changed the oars to thyrsi, the sails to vine-leaves, the ropes to ivy; then lions and panthers leapt out. When they saw them, in fear they cast themselves into the sea, and even in the sea he changed them to a sort of beast. For whoever leaped overboard was changed into dolphin shape, and from this dolphins are called Tyrrhenians, and the sea Tyrrhenian. They were twelve in number with the following names: Aethalides, Medon, Lycabas, Libys, Opheltes, Melas, Alcimedon, Epopeus, Dictys, Simon, Acoetes. The last was the pilot, whom Liber saved out of kindness.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Reference ==\nGaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae from The Myths of Hyginus translated and edited by Mary Grant.

She served for 16 years as principal of The Women's College at the University of Sydney.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilliams was born at Castlemaine in Victoria on 15 September 1875. Her parents were Jane (née Jones) and Welsh-born grocer Edward David Williams. Her father was Member for Castlemaine in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1894 to 1904. She completed her secondary education at Castlemaine Grammar School, then attended the University of Melbourne, living at Trinity College Hostel while she studied for a Bachelor of Arts. She graduated in 1897 with first-class honours. She went to England and enrolled at Newnham College, Cambridge reading classics (1897–1901) and also read archaeology at the University of London (1897–1898).\n\n\n== Career ==\nWilliams returned to Australia where she tutored in classics at the University of Melbourne. She joined Melbourne Church of England Girls' Grammar School in 1902 as an English and classics teacher and was promoted to head of staff in 1908. In 1914 she returned tutor in classics at Trinity College and became acting principal of Trinity College Hostel in 1919.\nIn June 1919 Williams was appointed the second principal of The Women's College (TWC) at the University of Sydney, taking over from Louisa Macdonald who had served in the role since it opened in 1892. Under her management, the college grew from 40 to 70 students.\nFollowing her retirement from TWC in 1935 she was appointed principal of University Women's College at the University of Melbourne, overseeing its opening in 1937. She was succeeded by Greta Hort in 1938.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" is a hymn by Isaac Watts, first published in 1707. The words describe the crucifixion of Jesus and reflect on an appropriate personal response to this event. The hymn is commonly sung with a refrain added in 1885 by Ralph E. Hudson; when this refrain is used, the hymn is sometimes known as \"At the Cross.\" The final line of the first stanza has attracted some criticism, as it describes the singer as a \"worm\". Hymnals often change the line from \"for such a worm as I\" to \"for such a one as I\" or \"for sinners such as I.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original composition ===\n\"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" was originally published in 1707, in Hymns and Spiritual Songs, which was the first collection of hymns by the prolific English hymnwriter Isaac Watts. This anthology was published in three volumes; \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" was included in volume 2. This volume comprised songs \"Composed on Divine Subjects\", and the hymn was given the heading \"Godly sorrow arising from the Sufferings of Christ.\"\nThe traditional words have commonly been paired with the hymn tune Martyrdom, which is an adaptation of a traditional Scottish melody, attributed to Hugh Wilson. The hymn has been more popular in the USA and Canada than in the UK; in North America, it is one of the most-sung hymns by Isaac Watts.\n\n\n=== At the Cross ===\nIn the context of late 19th-century revivalism, this became one of a number of traditional hymns that were turned into gospel songs with the addition of a chorus. In 1885, songwriter Ralph E. Hudson added a repeated refrain in his hymnbook Songs of Peace, Love, and Joy. This refrain has been included in many hymnals:  \n\nThe words and music of this refrain probably originated in camp meetings of the time. When this chorus is included, the hymn is often known as \"At the Cross.\" Hudson also wrote a new tune in a gospel style for the verses; this tune is known as Hudson. The refrain has sometimes been added to other hymns as well, or included in hymnbooks as a standalone chorus.\n\n\n== Text ==\n\n\n=== Original words ===\nThe original hymn had six four-line stanzas.\n\n\n=== Analysis ===\nThe hymn words centre on the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the opening verses offer a concise summary of the doctrine of penal substitution. This doctrine is approached from a personal and emotional perspective, leading to a reflection on the appropriate response to Jesus' death. In the Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology, Alan Gaunt describes it as \"one of Watts's most intense lyric poems,\" which \"emphasises the emotional effect on the writer and the reader/singer.\" According to Leland Ryken, the hymn contains the \"speaker's thought process as he comes to grips with the crucifixion and what it means for him\", and invites the singer to \"enact the same thought process.\" Comparing this hymn with another well-known Isaac Watts hymn, \"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross\", Carl P. Daw Jr. notes that where the latter is \"objective and sweeping; this one is subjective and tightly focused.\"\n\n\n=== Alterations ===\nHymn books commonly omit the second stanza, which is described as an optional verse in the originally published version. In Salvation Army hymn books, the line \"God the mighty Maker\" in stanza four is changed to \"Christ the mighty maker.\"\nAs well as the refrain included by Ralph E. Hudson, other hymn books have added a chorus to the hymn. Charles Price Jones, founder of the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A., added the following refrain:\n\nIn the 1986 Song Book of the Salvation Army, the added refrain was:\n\n\n=== For such a worm as I ===\nThe final line of the first stanza (\"for such a worm as I\") is amended in many hymnals. Sometimes, the word \"worm\" is changed to \"one\" or more commonly, the line is altered to \"sinners such as I\".\nThe original line has been criticised by some modern commentators as an example of unhelpful \"worm theology\", which suggests to people that \"low self-worth means God is more likely to show mercy and compassion upon them.\" Writing for Christianity Today, Mark Galli found the line problematic for promoting the idea that \"only by abasing ourselves are we able to grasp and receive God's mercy.\" Theologian Anthony A. Hoekema has described the lyrics as an example of a hymn that has made a \"contribution to the negative self-image often found among Christians.\"\nIn response to this criticism, David W. Music has claimed that the word \"worm\" is both lyrically and biblically appropriate:\n\nHere, the \"worm\" language sets up a contrast between the majestic \"Sacred Head\" of Christ and the hymn writer’s (and singer’s) own status as a creature that falls far short of the glory of God. The writer may have also had in mind Job 25:6 (\"How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a  worm?\") or Psalm 22:6 (\"But I am a worm, and no man\").\nTheologian Marva Dawn argued that the hymn's \"worm\" imagery is an important way of highlighting the \"incredible freedom and immense joy of forgiveness.\"  Hymnologist Madeleine Forell Marshall suggested Watts was not intending to make a general comment on humanity, but to describe how, when faced with the death of Jesus, we are \"initially filled with powerful disgust and graphic self-loathing.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"How Long\", also released as \"How Long (Will It Take)\", is a song recorded by the Canadian singer Paula Toledo around 2003, known for being considered a piece of lost media for sixteen years. Initially, the track was not released commercially, being only licensed to appear in the film Secret Lives and the TV series 15/Love in 2005. Two years later, a user posted online about a bootleg DVD that contained a snippet of the song, prompting a search for the track's origin that attracted the attention of the lostwave community. In December 2023, the song's origin was discovered, and Toledo released it as a single that same month in response. Musically, the track was compared to the Cranberries.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nPaula Toledo is an artist, songwriter, and motivational speaker. She grew up in Montreal before relocating to Vancouver for college. Toledo recorded \"How Long\" in Langley, British Columbia, around 2003. The song was co-produced by Jonathan Anderson of the Canadian band Jonathan Inc., and guitarist David Odlum of the Irish band the Frames mixed it in France. While the song was initially written for her debut studio album, it was not included there. Despite this, it was well-liked in her setlists. After a show at a neighborhood restaurant, an employee from Lionsgate Entertainment inquired about licensing the song. In 2005, it was licensed for Secret Lives, a made-for-TV film, and 15/Love, a youth sitcom. Because of this, and for \"artistic reasons\", Toledo also did not include the song in her extended play. Toledo left the music field after she became a single mother due to the death of her husband.\n\nToledo wrote \"How Long\" from her personal perspective, and believes it resonates with modern audiences because it conveys the importance of living authentically. A four-minute song, it was musically compared to the Irish band the Cranberries. Miles Klee of Rolling Stone and V. S. Wells of The Georgia Straight described it as a \"yearning\" track. Klee described it as jangle rock, while Wells found inspiration in 1980s rock and early 2000s \"guitar-driven pop\". Jon Azpiri of CBC News felt that the song would fit well with modern adult contemporary radio and film soundtracks, due to the \"wistful\" vocals of Toledo and the guitar usage. Toledo tagged the song's Bandcamp release under folk rock, indie folk, and indie pop.\n\n\n== Search and discovery ==\n\"How Long\" was first mentioned online in August 2007, when a user on a Ukrainian forum mentioned that a snippet of the song was featured on the menu of a bootleg Russian DVD. A small group of fans formed to uncover the song's origin. The search became popular in the lostwave community, which is dedicated to trying to identify the provenance of songs considered unknown or lost. Because the song was never released commercially, it was not possible to find it through Google or apps like Shazam. The song was initially named \"How Long It Will Take\", based on a line from the chorus. Some people made tribute videos for \"How Long\" featuring images of teddy bears, while others created remixes and covers of the song. In October 2023, a subreddit, r/HLWIT, was created, named after the initials of the unofficial title, and had one thousand members by December.\nOn December 8, 2023, sixteen years after \"How Long\" was first mentioned on the Internet, Reddit user the-arabara posted that he had found the song's origin. Initially, he tried to find the creators of the DVDs, \"track[ed] down a movie mentioned on a job application\", and found another obscure song in its credits. Ultimately, he found the track when searching for songs titled \"How Long\" on the Society of Composer, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada's database. This led him to another Reddit post and ultimately to a podcast containing the full song. Reddit users commemorated the discovery on r/HLWIT.\nThat same day, Toledo got multiple emails about the discovery, which surprised her; she initially believed the messages to be scams. In response, she released the full version of \"How Long\" on Bandcamp on December 13. All proceeds from the song's sales in 2023 went to the Music Heals Charitable Foundation, which supports and raises awareness of music therapy. Later, Toledo released the song on streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music. However, as a result of a duplicate, unofficial version of the song appearing on streaming platforms, the official version was taken down, which she suspected to be because of streaming fraud. The song was officially reuploaded to YouTube Music on May 9, 2024, under the title \"How Long (Will It Take)\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from the 2023 release on Bandcamp.\n\nPaula Toledo — lead and background vocals, guitar, writing, production\nJonathan Anderson — guitar, keyboard, percussion, background vocals, production, mastering\nDavid Odlum — mixing\nTrevor Grant — drums\nJohn Bews — bass\nLonely Girl Productions — photography\n\n\n== See also ==\n\"The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet\"\nPanchiko\nRare groove\n\"Ready 'n' Steady\"\n\"Ulterior Motives\" (song)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bog Hot Springs is a thermal spring located in the Bog Hot Valley, in Humboldt County, Nevada. It is known to the locals as Bog Hot.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe hot springs have been used to water stock animals and also to irrigate hay. Currently, the springs are used as a domestic water source, and as recreational hot mineral water baths that are locatd on the Bog Hot Springs Ranch.\nThe hot springs are located on a fault line between Oregon and the Soldier Meadows hot spring system.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe springs are located in Nevada a few miles south of the Oregon border on the north side of Continental Lake, next to the Pueblo Mountains. The Baltazor Hot Springs can be found nearby.\nThe hot springs are located on private land, the Bog Hot Springs Cattle Ranch, however they are free and available for the public to use.\n\n\n== Water profile ==\nThe hot mineral water emerges from the ground at a rate of 3800 L/min at a temperature of 131 °F (55 °C), and cool to a temperature of 108 °F (42 °C) in the reservoir. After emerging from the source, the water flows for a mile through the desert to a collection reservoir.\nThe flow of the geothermally heated water can be found along the Western branch of the fault lineament as it runs from Soldier Meadows hot springs to McGee Mountain and Gridley Lake. The flow is controlled by the junction of an older fault system as well as the Basin and Range fault.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wiener Looping is a steel roller coaster at Wurstelprater (located within Wiener Prater) in Leopoldstadt, Vienna, Austria. Built by Mack Rides, the coaster will span multiple sections of the amusement park and be one of its few attractions operated by owner Stefan Sittler-Koidl.\nWiener Looping was first announced in 2021 but was marred by several construction setbacks, most notably the unauthorized demolition of a nightclub and its associated legal injunction. The coaster is planned to open in September 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nWiener Prater has typically consisted of several independent operators running most of the park's attractions, with only a couple owned by the park itself. Prater president Stefan Sittler-Koidl described it as a childhood dream to eventually build and operate his own roller coaster.\nPlanning for the new attraction first began as early as 2019. In June 2021, Sittler-Koidl first spoke of the new \"Vienna Looping” coaster, promised to span several plots of land and become the largest permanent roller coaster in Austria. Depending on approvals, construction was earmarked to have begun that September and have the coaster opened in early 2022.\nAlthough progress had not been made by that time, ride designer Julian Omonsky instead teased the involvement of Mack Rides in January 2022. Further reports emerged soon after claiming that the coaster would be the company's customized BigDipper model and occupy land next to Megablitz and the Ghost Train, with a 2023 debut targeted. The first pieces of concept artwork were released in December 2022, with work slated to begin in the new year.\n\n\n=== Kantine Demolition and Legal Case ===\nConstruction of Wiener Looping would require the demolition of the former Bachsteinhalle building on Plot 34, which had sat vacant for years and formerly housed a Novomatic Casino, coffee shop, and warehouse. Prior to the building's planned demolishment, it was set to temporarily host the Kantine nightclub from October 2022 until November. The Kantine's tenants disagreed with Prater on their move-out date and filed an injunction; in response, on January 7, 2023, Sittler-Koidl himself operated an excavator and illegally demolished part of the building. Motion sensors and surveillance notified Kantine director Anna Jurjans of a break-in; upon arriving, she found the building partially torn down and notified the police. The construction firm contracted for its demolition confirmed that they'd had no involvement in the incident, and Sittler-Koidl admitted to carrying out the illegal work himself, frustrated that Wiener Looping's construction was two months behind schedule.\nThe Kantine's owners claimed about €250,000 in damages and negotiated with Prater for a settlement. Despite ride hardware beginning to arrive onsite, the injunction remained in place and forced construction to be postponed by another year. Sittler-Koidl later spoke to the EuroAmusement Professional magazine of an attempted sale of Wiener Looping; it had been placed on the market in July and attracted an interested buyer, but the project ultimately stayed at Wiener Prater.\n\n\n=== Announcement and Construction ===\nWiener Looping track was first stored at the Hafen Wien harbor in May 2023, and Prater soon installed the first support columns within the site's neighboring Ghost Train building. Demolition of the Bachsteinhalle was able to resume by February 2024. The first track piece was delivered to the construction site on March 20, 2024, as a part of a press event, in which Wiener Prater officially announced the new coaster. Animation and statistics of Wiener Looping were released at this time, and the coaster is currently expected to open in September 2024.\n\n\n== Ride experience ==\nDeparting the station, riders make a left hand turn into the lift hill, carrying riders overtop a guest pathway to a peak height of 101.7 feet (31.0 m) at a speed of 4 m/s (13 ft/s). At the top, the train makes a slow 180° turn to the left before descending a 92° drop. An airtime hill carries the train back over the pathway before plummeting into a trench and two successive inversions; a Banana Roll and elongated Vertical loop, offering a brief stall while upside down. The car follows up into a sharply ascending right turn only to exit into a dive loop/drop. Riders navigate a counterclockwise helix and airtime hill before making a final turnaround to the lift in the brake run.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nWiener Looping will be 101.7 feet (31.0 m) tall, 1,699.5 feet (518.0 m) long, and reach a top speed of 50.3 mph (81.0 km/h) throughout the ride. The coaster will run with two single-car trains, each of which will seat eight riders in two rows of four.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe coaster was named after the original Wiener Looping, a modified Anton Schwarzkopf Shuttle Loop designed to be portable and fit within a tight plot of land at Wiener Prater. First set up in 1982, the coaster never opened to the public due to noise complaints from local residents, and was quickly taken down. The coaster was sold off and through its lifetime has operated at and/or with Boardwalk and Baseball, German fairground operator Goetzke, Flamingo Land Resort, and most recently and currently at Selva Mágica.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Christine von Wattenwyl (25 November 1888 – 25 January 1964) was a Swiss Salvationist officer and religious worker. She was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Salvation Army and a pioneer of prison care in Switzerland. In 1964, she was posthumously awarded the Order of the Founder.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChristine von Wattenwyl was born on 25 November 1888 to a family of the Swiss nobility. Her parents were Rudolf von Wattenwyl and Pauline von Wattenwyl. She was raised in the Swiss Reformed Church. Inspired by her aunt, Anna von Wattenwyl, she converted to Salvationism.\nIn 1912, von Wattenwyl enrolled in the Salvation Army's officers' school in London. She was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\nFrom 1914 to 1916, she worked for the church in Paris before returning to Switzerland to work in Le Locle, Orbe, and Sainte-Croix. From 1921 until the end of her career, von Wattenwyl was based at the Salvation Army in Berne. She spent her life serving prisoners and was a pioneer for prison care for the Salvation Army in Switzerland. Modeled after the prison welfare system of the Salvation Army in Japan, von Wattenwyl set up an independent branch of prison welfare that included spiritual and material support for inmates and their families and aftercare programs following inmate release.\nVon Wattenwyl died on 25 January 1964 in Oberdiessbach. She was posthumously awarded the Order of the Founder that same year, becoming the third Swiss woman to receive the honor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The siege of Yerevan was a military engagement of the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639). During this siege, the Ottoman Empire occupied the city of Yerevan.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nThe conflict with the Ottomans Shah Abbas had started and continued after his death in 1629 under the leadership of his grandson Shah Safi. Eager to prevent further losses against the Safavids, the Ottoman sultan, Murad IV, began preparing for a long campaign to invade the Safavid territory in 1635. Throughout the campaign, he executed those who neglected their duties, as well as highway robbers and bandits. The Ottoman army arrived in the city of Yerevan on July 26.\nThe Sultan establishes his camp on Hünkâr Hill, where he is able to see the city clearly. On July 29, the Ottomans placed their cannons on the hill overlooking the castle and began bombarding the walls. The bombing caused casualties and damaged not only the walls but also the houses within. The next day, the Janisseries attacked the barricades of the Safavids, but despite intense bombardment, which inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, the Ottomans successfully captured their barricades. In order to keep the Ottoman troops morale high, the Sultan personally took care of the wounded and checked their conditions.\nThe Ottomans kept bombarding the city constantly, and on August 2, the Safavids launched a sortie against the Rumelian soldiers. Even though it was an organized attack, they were repelled and compelled to retreat behind the walls. The garrison did not dare to go out in offense after this. The Safavid commander, Emirgûneoğlu Tahmasp Kuli, dispatched his lieutenant, Murad Agha, to negotiate with the grand vizier, Tabanıyassı Mehmed Pasha, who showed him to the Sultan and offered him the castle in exchange for their lives, to which he agreed. On August 8, the Safavids ceded the city.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nEmirgûneoğlu Tahmasp Kuli joined the Ottomans and became a Sunni Muslim alongside Murad Agha. He would change his name to Yusuf Pasha and be appointed governor of Aleppo. The Sultan left Yerevan and headed towards Tabriz 13 days later. He captured the city and laid waste to it. After the arrival of winter and the Safavids avoiding battles, the Ottomans returned to Istanbul. Murad had the Yerevan Kiosk in the Topkapı Palace built to commemorate his victory at Yerevan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nErhan Afyoncu (2022), A Short History of the Ottoman Empire (Yeditepe Yayınev).[1]\nMeir Litvak & Ofra Bengio (2014), The Sunna and Shi'a in History, Division, and Ecumenism in the Muslim Middle East.[2]\nÖzer Küpeli (2009), Ottoman-Safavid Relations (1612–1639) (In Turkish).[3]",

The fighting took place mainly in the Vilnius region and beyond.\n\n\n== The Beginning of Fighting in 1940–1942 ==\n\n\n=== Causes of the conflict ===\nThe roots of the conflict date back to the early 20th century, In particular, it is necessary to shed light on mutual relations in the area where these crimes took place, i.e. the Polish-Lithuanian ethnic, linguistic and state borderland, linguistic and state borderland in the northern part of Vilnius. By its very nature, this borderland was a zone of clash between the two elements and a place where, in an inflammatory situation In the first place, confrontation took place. When the conflict escalated, for example during the fighting in October and November 1920, it became a frontline area. The bloodiest Polish-Lithuanian battles were fought here, at Giedroje and Širvintos. In the following years, the neutral zone separating the two sides was still smouldering between Lithuanian and Polish between Lithuanian and Polish militias and military and police formations, a guerrilla war and police formations, partisan warfare of minor intensity\nThe language issue played a key role in the national self-identification of the rural population in the Vilnius region. The spread of the Polish language in the sub-Vilnius province took place in the second half of the 19th century. Successive generations of villagers were more and more willing to use the culturally attractive Polish language, which later resulted in their Polish national identification. The Polish language had long been the main language of the local elite - landowners and the Christian urban population. In the northern part of the Vilnius district even in the 1890s the dominance of the Lithuanian language was still observed. In the northern part of Vilnius County as late as 1890s, Lithuanian was still dominant in the countryside, while the inhabitants of In the northern part of Vilnius County as late as 1890s, Lithuanian was still predominant in the countryside, while the inhabitants of manor houses, farmsteads and Christian inhabitants of local towns used mainly\nPolish language. Interesting data on the linguistic structure of these towns is provided by the census conducted by the starosts of the peasants' land on the order of the Marshal of the gentry of the Vilnius Governorate Adam Plater in 1890. which showed that Lithuanians were in the minority, as in Gedrojets 52% were Jews, 34% were Poles, 2% Russians, only 14% were Lithuanians\nA valuable material for reconstructing the picture of the nationality structure of the fragment of the described borderland is the 1912 census of the faithful of the Roman Catholic parish in Giedrojec, which includes information on their nationality. This document was drawn up at a particular moment in history, namely during the period of the heated Polish-Lithuanian conflict over the language of supplementary services in the local church. The aforementioned census includes a total of over 5,600 worshippers, of whom 46 percent are recorded as Lithuanian and 43 per cent as Polish. With more than 10 percent.\nMuch more favourably presented was the Polish estate in the light of the results of the census conducted three years later, on 19 December 1919, by the Polish Civil Administration of Eastern Territories. In the municipalities of Niemenczyn, Podbrzezie, Giedrocie and Janiszki municipalities, Polish nationality was to be declared by 77-97 per cent of the inhabitants. Lithuanians Lithuanians were expected to prevail only slightly in the municipality of Malaty (44.9 percent Lithuanians and 42.5 percent Poles), located to the north of the district. Poles), located to the north of Gedrojec and Janiszki. Against the background of the earlier 1916 German census German census of 1916, the Polish census showed in the municipalities of Giedrojć, Janiszki and Malaty in total about 10-15 percent more Poles and correspondingly fewer Lithuanians.\nIn November 1920, after the end of the Lithuanian-Polish battles over Vilnius and the formation of the demarcation line separating the warring sides at the level of Dubinskie Lake, the municipality of Giedraičiai and the northern half of the municipality of Janiškės were cut off from the Vilnius district. After the neutral zone (passing through both municipalities) was eliminated in February 1923, the demarcation line became the de facto border between the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Poland, which was approved by the Council of Ambassadors on 15 March 1923. However, it was never recognised by the Lithuanian state and was referred to as the demarcation line and later as the administrative line. It was never recognised by the Lithuanian state and was referred to as the demarcation line and later as the administrative line.\nIn practice, mainly Poles lived on both sides of the border in this section. The new demarcation had consequences in terms of changes to the borders of municipalities and counties. On the Lithuanian side, the municipality of Gedraičiai was mostly included in the Vilniakės county and the municipality of Janiškės (basically its northern half) was included in the Učės county. The southern part of the municipality of Janiszki, which remained on the Polish side, became part of the newly created municipality of Podbrodzie. The municipalities of Nemenčinė and Podbrzezie, on the other hand, became part of the new Vilnius-Trotsky district.\n\nThe drastically different results of the 1942 wartime census make one view its reliability critically. The value of these results lies perhaps only in the fact that they illustrate the strongly anti-Polish atmosphere of the period, to which the survey respondents apparently succumbed. Especially among the rural population, there was widespread agitation to claim Lithuanian nationality. Lithuanians spread rumours by various means that after the elimination of the Jews, the next to be murdered would be Poles.\nHowever, polonisation and the rise of the Novolitvins is not the main reason for the struggles of the Lithuanians but. The desire to regain Vilnius and the main enmity caused by the fall of the January Uprising, which was sealed by massive Russification and an attempt to divide the Poles and Lithuanians. Massacres like Dubiencie reflect well the effects of this Russification\n\n\n=== Conflict ===\nThe Lithuanian security police, the Sauguma, closely followed the formation and activities of the Polish independence movement in Vilnius. It considered these organisations to be illegal, claiming that they were aiming to rebuild the Polish state within the pre-war borders (i.e. with Wüne) and therefore considered them to be carrying out subversive activities against the Lithuanian state. The Sauguma's information bulletins preserved a dose of meticulous notes and discharges about the efforts made to penetrate the Polish underground organisations in order to reveal their purpose, their numbers and the Nature of their activities. It was even noted in the files that every Saturday and Sunday \"Boże coś Polske\" was practically sung in all the churches of Vilnius and Vilnius region, as well as masses were held for the intention of Poland.\nThe Sauguma made efforts to break up the Polish independence movement, as it considered that its activities were directed against the Lithuanian state, and that the Poles were fighting against the occupants (German and Soviet) was not taken into account. In addition, there were the first contacts between the Gestapo and the Sauguma to fight the Polish underground, which was very dangerous for the Polish underground. In the spring of 1940, the Lithuanian side handed over four transports of Polish prisoners. The transfer of the Polish prisoners took place at the German-Lithuanian border near Sejny. Together with the prisoners, the Lithuanian side handed over to the Gestapo a list of prisoners drawn up by Lithuanians.\nAfter 10 July, arrests of Polish underground activists and Lithuanian nationalists began. It was carried out by the NKVD (former Sauguma). The NKVD also seized the Sauguma's files on the Polish underground in the Vilnius region. Already at the beginning of November, the Sauguma found a trace of the Fighting Poland Organisation (OPW). The aim of this organisation was to organise fighting against the enemy in the Vilnius region at the right time. Many young people, military officers and their families belonged to the Fighting Poland Organisation. In the Sauguma report it was reported that the following people belonged to the organisation: Amanda Aleksandrowiczowa, the wife of a colonel, propaganda department and employee of the two; Zofia Karwowska, that'na pulkownik, meetings of the organisation were held in the flat; Bronislawa Goröwna, the wife of a major, vice-president of the Military Family; Lesia Pacholska, head of the scouts; Maria Swiecinska, maintained communication with Warsaw; Jozef Ciesielski, one of the close employees of pic. Dabrovsky; Kazimiera Komaiszko, liaison officer; Maria Andruszkiewiczowa, representative of the Union of Polish Teachers, recruiting young people to the OPW. Report This report comes from the Sauguma bulletins and is dated 10 November 1939.\nIn total, Sauguma managed to decode 173 people belonging to the aforementioned organisation. 168 were arrested, five managed to avoid arrest. 47 people were released after testifying. In Lukiski Prison on 19 March 1940, 121 people were serving their sentence, 51 of them confessed. Sauguma succeeded in deciphering the structure of the organisation. The primary goal was to win Polish independence. It was revealed that the organisation mobilised patriotic youth and trained them to fight. The organisation was structured on a military basis, with a commander at the head, to whom the command was subordinate. Then the Red Army entered and annexed Lithuania and the baltic states, peace began to reign until the Germans entered the area in 1941.\nThe encroaching German army was treated by Lithuanians as liberators; Lithuanian partisans actively assisted the Germans.8 The Front of Lithuanian Activists (LAF), which was founded in 1940 in Berlin in Berlin in 1940, the Lithuanian Activist Front (Lietuviu Aktivistu Frontas - LAF), joined the fight against the retreating Soviet army. As early as 23 June, the LAF proclaimed its own government under the leadership of Pic K. Szkirpa. At the same time, the LAF demanded that the Germans recognise that the Lithuanian state had not ceased to exist. Accounts failed. As early as 28 June, Lithuanian partisan detachments were disarmed in.\nAt the end of October 1941, a Lithuanian delegation headed by Shkyrpa was Ribbentrop, the Foreign Minister of the Third Reich, who refused to listen to its demands. their demands. He declared that Hitler knew how to decide the future of Lithuania and remembered the behaviour of Lithuanians during the Bolshevik occupation.\nThe Lithuanian administration was ready to serve anyone who impressed its šila. The conclusion suggested by the Vilnius District Command in its report is that \"in liquidating the Polish element in the local area, the Lithuanians show even more ruthlessness than in liquidating the Jews, and the Germans will film as they filmed the Jews\". General Rowecki - \"Grot\" was right when he wrote to the Headquarters of the Supreme Command in London on 11 May 1942 regarding the Lithuanian issue that: it is to be expected that a planned and fierce pogrom against the Poles in Lithuania will be attempted. The pogrom against the Poles in Vilnius came much sooner, already in the first months of the German occupation. This period, September 1941 – June 1942, can be called a period of ethnic cleansing in these areas. The Lithuanians took advantage German occupation to achieve their national aims: the destruction of the Polish element. The Polish government-in-exile closely followed the development of the situation in the Vilnius region on the basis of reports and accounts. It made efforts to improve relations with Lithuanians and Lithuanian organisations working in exile.\nIn the autumn and winter of 1942, the Germans launched a colonisation campaign in Samogitia. This involved the expulsion of Lithuanian families, most of whom were resettled in the Vilnius region. In September 1942, a decree was issued defining the first German settlement zone. It covered the left bank of the Nemunas and Western Zhmudža along the line Rusiejne-Szavle. In this way a wide German corridor was to be created parallel to the Baltic and linking East Prussia with Latvia. This caused resentment among the Lithuanians. From the sweat of December 1942, Poles began to be expelled from the Vilnius region, to be replaced by Lithuanian families from Samogitia. This was carried out by the Lithuanian police, composed of foreign elements. Several thousands of Polish farmers, residents of villages in rzeszanski, podbrzeska and mejszagolski municipalities.\n\n\n=== Ponary massacre ===\nMain article: Ponary massacre\nAttempts by Poles to save their property were suppressed by the police and the newly arrived Lithuanians. During the catego 1942, the murder of Poles took place in Ponary\n\n\n== Conflict at Vilnius Region and beyond 1943 ==\nAt the beginning of 1943, the Germans ordered the conscription of Lithuanians into auxiliary formations for the SS and the Battic Legion. The Lithuanian community reacted negatively to this conscription, and leaflets were issued telling people not to join the army. Approximately 3-4 thousand people applied, of whom 1,500 were conscripted. Only a few dozen people applied to join the Battic Legion. As reprisals for the failure to conscript Lithuanian youth into the German formations, the German authorities closed the Lithuanian university in Vilnius (which existed in the buildings and on the basis of the USB\nIn view of the expressed hostility to the Poles, anti-Polish activity proved too costly. The mood of uncertainty led to a cessation of murders of Poles and blatant anti-Polish accents. Warnings from London, which came at the request of the Polish government, played a major role in this matter. However, this did not mean any rapprochement between Lithuanian social strata and the Poles. The Polish radio broadcasts from London on 13 and 23 February 1943, which spoke of an improvement in Polish-Lithuanian relations in Vilnius, had a downright negative effect. The Lithuanians drew the conclusion from the broadcasts that any rape would go unpunished. \nAround 1943, one of the political factions of the Government Delegation for Poland for the Vilnius region, the Vilnius Democratic Concentration (Polish: Wileńska Koncentracja Demokratyczna) – the underground union of leftist Polish parties,partly because of the pro-Nazi stance of Lithuanian authorities, and partly influenced by the nationalist stance of Polish Endecja party, stated a plan to occupy Lithuania after the war, submit it under the rule of Polish General Commissariat and to re-educate \"corrupt\" Lithuanians.\nIn the spring of 1943, the Lithuanian and German authorities in Kaunas ordered the deportation of all the people of Polish nationality living there, and the Polish administration and police cooperated zealously with the Germans. The Lithuanian administration and police cooperated zealously with the Germans in this matter.\nIn the autumn of 1943, after a slight repression of the Lithuanians, a new propaganda campaign was launched to win the Lithuanians to the most explicit cooperation and to cross out the March misunderstanding \"the Lithuanian community is slowly maturing to the idea that it will soon be called to arms in German formations\".\nMeanwhile, on December 28, 1943, a major action on Turgiele was carried out with the forces of two brigades. The attack took place at dusk. Lithuanian policemen spotted the attackers and opened fire from their headquarters. Shots also rang out from some houses. It was Lithuanian officials, sent to Turgiel, who joined the fight. After the Polish partisans used grenades, the Lithuanian policemen surrendered and the opom fires were put out. Lithuanian policemen and officials were stripped of their weapons and uniforms. They were dismissed, ordered to leave the area and go where they came from, i.e. Kaunas Lithuania. A commander spoke to the Lithuanian policemen, stating that Poles do not do any harm to defenceless people, but he emphasised that Lithuanians behave differently when they bully Polish soldiers accidentally taken prisoner. During the action at the municipal office, documents and registers of agricultural contractors were destroyed. \n\nA lot of goods were taken from shops and dairies, and almost all weapons and ammunition were captured. After the action there was a 15-kilometre retreat to Pohidna and accommodation in the village of Onžadovo. On 31 December 1943, three patrols of \"Tonka\" brigade and \"Szczerbiec\" brigade liquidated a robber band in the Stoki estate. The commander of the band escaped, the others were killed. The found loot through a softy was given back to the inhabitants of surrounding villages.\nThe situation changed at the end of 1943, when both communist and Polish partisan formations became increasingly active in both Kaunas and Vilnius Lithuania. It was then that once again the Germans decided to attempt to create Lithuanian military and police formations. This time, support for this initiative was expressed by all Lithuanian political factors from the General Council to the underground anti-German VLIK - Vyriausiasis Lietuvos Išlaisvinimo Komitetas (Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania). The Committee issued a proclamation to this effect, declaring that it \"supports the reconstruction of the Lithuanian armed forces\". On 13 February 1944, the higher commander of the SS and police in Ostland, SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and SS-Brigadeführer Hermann Harm signed an agreement to establish the LVR - Lietuvos Vietinė Rinktinė (Lithuanian Territorial Corps). Its signatory on the Lithuanian side was General Povilas Plechavičius, appointed as commander of the LVR by order of 1 February 1944. The choice of Plechavičius was not accidental.\nThe fact that it happened was determined by conflicting interests. The main bone of contention was the question of the territorial belonging of Vilnius and the Vilnius region. Both Poles and Lithuanians clung to their own interests, refusing to accept that the Bolsheviks were about to invade the disputed territory. The Bolsheviks, in turn, had their own vision of resolving the Polish-Lithuanian dispute by annexing Vilnius (along with the whole of Lithuania) to the USSR. Before either side realised the gravity of the Bolshevik threat, unnecessary fighting ensued. The Lithuanians believed that the LVR would stop the process of liquidation of Lithuanian institutions in the Vilnius Region, initiated by the Home Army in the spring of 1944, while the leaders of the Polish underground naively believed that clearing the Vilnius Region of Lithuanian influence would create better conditions for the annexation of the Vilnius Region to Poland.\n\n\n== Intensification of fighting in 1944 ==\nThe fact that it happened was determined by conflicting interests. The main bone of contention was the question of the territorial belonging of Vilnius and the Vilnius region. Both Poles and Lithuanians clung to their own interests, refusing to accept that the Bolsheviks were about to invade the disputed territory. The Bolsheviks, in turn, had their own vision of resolving the Polish-Lithuanian dispute by annexing Vilnius (along with the whole of Lithuania) to the USSR.

Gregor Schnabel, commander of the German gendarmerie stationed in Oshmia (Vilnius voivodeship), was notified that a partisan unit of about 100 men (the term banda was used) was stationed in the small village of Mikuliszki. The report was not precise; in fact, the partisans were staying in Buniany, 5 km distant from Mikuliszki, and only before dawn on 8 January 1944 did they move to the village indicated in the report. The gendarme proceeded to organise the forces with which he intended to smash the detected unit. The organised group included 16 German gendarmes, who served in garrisons stationed in Oshmia and Holshany, and 59 Lithuanian and Belorussian policemen, serving in Oshmia on a daily basis. On the morning of 8 January, Lt Schnabel set off by sleigh towards the village. The German commander was so confident of victory that he took with him a sack, which was filled with handcuffs - these were to be used to handcuff the captured partisans.\nThe partisans referred to in the report to Lt. Gregor Schnabel were soldiers of the King Bolesław Chrobry Flight Detachment and the 6th Brigade of the Home Army. The flying squad was headed by Lt. Gracjan Fróg \"Szczerbiec\", while the brigade was commanded by Lt. cc. Adam Boryczka \"Tońko\". Both squads had considerable combat experience and had several successful combat actions to their credit. The backbone of the units was made up of Vilnius secondary school students, and it is interesting to note that several Frenchmen served in \"Szczerbiec's\" unit, as well as some Frenchmen who had already been killed in action.\nIn the first days of January 1944. \"Szczerbiec\" and \"Tońko\" left the grouping and went to Vilnius, where they were to meet with the commander of the Vilnius District of the AK, Lt. Col. Aleksander Krzyżanowski \"Wilk\". Lieutenant Frog was replaced in command of the unit by Lt. Col. Romuald Rajs \"Bury\", and command of the VI Brigade was taken over by Lt. cc. Piotr Motylewicz \"Szczepcio\". In the morning of 8 January 1944, the partisan grouping reached Mikuliszki, located on the Merecznka River, which boasted a small cemetery where the insurgents of 1863 were buried. The village was situated among forests and marshes; moreover, Mikuliszki lay off the main transport routes. This small village was not able to provide quarters and provisions for the entire partisan force. In view of the above, \"Bury\" and \"Szczepcio\" divided the troops. The infantry part of the flying squad was quartered in Mikuliszki (about 65 partisans), the nine-person mounted reconnaissance was stationed on a small farm a few hundred metres outside the village, and the 6th Brigade (about 30 partisans) was quartered in Lapiejki, located 1.5 km from Mikuliszki.\nThe partisans, stationed in Mikuliszki, had drill exercises in the morning, had breakfast and by 11 a.m. began weapons training; the cavalrymen first had to groom their horses and for this reason, with a delay compared to their infantry colleagues, began preparations for the morning meal. Stationed in Lapiejki, \"Szczepcia\"'s subordinates spent their time similarly to their comrades-in-arms in Mikuliszki. Meanwhile, the officers of the German repression apparatus were approaching the village, and the commander of the expedition divided his forces into three groups. The two outermost were the arms surrounding the village, while the middle one was to push the partisans out of the village with a strong blow, straight under the barrels of the policemen surrounding the village. However, the expedition leader made a mistake. He did not recognise the surrounding villages and was therefore unaware that around 40 Polish soldiers were stationed outside Mikuliszki.\n\nThe police grouping hit Mikuliszki at around 11 a.m. N.N., who was standing in front of the village on the so-called lookout. \"Tuz\", as soon as he spotted the attackers, alerted the partisans quartered in the village with shots of the imminent danger. The battle began. In its initial stage, the German side gained dominance, which was the result of a considerable firepower advantage of the Germans, nevertheless the partisans commanded by \"Bury\" managed to stop the advancing gendarmes and accompanying policemen. However, this success did not come easily. Three partisans were killed in the fight: Władysław Stundis \"Wernes\" - a talented footballer, \"Wodnik\" (Trubaczewski?) - a Pole living in Gdańsk before the war, and Jean Charles Meffre \"Michel\" - a French volunteer; in addition, six partisans were severely wounded. The outcome of the battle in favour of the partisans was decided by the exit to the rear of the punitive cavalry expedition of the flying squad and soldiers of the 6th Brigade, Unfortunately, the partisan grouping also paid with losses at this stage of the clash. The acting commander of VI Brigade, \"Szczepcio\", and one of his subordinates, Zbigniew Młodkowski \"Malicki\", fell. Before nightfall, the battle was over and the result was an undoubted success for the Polish side. According to German figures, six gendarmes (including the expedition commander) and 19 policemen were killed in the battle. Polish reports estimate the enemy's losses even higher. The partisans took several members of the police group prisoner. Among them were Lithuanians and Belarusians. Several Lithuanian policemen were shot. According to the knowledge gained by the partisans, they were the perpetrators of a series of murders of Polish civilians near Swieciany in 1942. The two Belarusians taken prisoner, who were not charged with war crimes, were released. One of them volunteered to join the Polish partisans and from then on served in the \"Szczerbiec\" unit - he took the pseudonym \"Szary\". The other policeman most likely holed up somewhere, as he never returned to police duty. In addition, a wounded gendarme, Gotthilf Killinger, was taken prisoner. The ward doctor, Lech Iwanowski 'Lancet', treated the wounded German, after which he was released with a message to his superiors, pointing out that it was the Germans who attacked first and the partisans defended themselves. In this way, the intention was to show that the partisans had no hostile intentions towards the Germans, which was clearly.\nAlso in March 1944. OP \"Piotra\" carried out an action to expel Lithuanian colonists, especially from the Podbrzezie commune. Partisan patrols came to individual farms at night, who ordered the settlers to leave within 24 hours, under threat of the death penalty. As a rule The fear for their lives was also shared by the neighbours, who left without waiting, who left without waiting for a visit from the partisans. The fugitives sought protection in the nearest municipalities, under the protection of the Lithuanian police. Some, however, went to Vilnius or fled deeper into Lithuania. According to the memoirs of a participant in these events, Lithuanian teacher Stasys Lisauskas, after the battle, the AK soldiers set fire to the wooden post, having previously locked the wounded Lithuanians inside. However, the lightly wounded later managed to break down the burning door and pull out the more severely injured, thus avoiding being burnt alive. In the report submitted by the commanding action officer was silent about the deliberate burning of the villa after the battle.\nIn the spring of 1944, a group of Polish partisans disarmed the inhabitants of the village of Kozaki near Bijuciszek: Tyškevičius, Pertas Pivoras and the Narušis brothers. The attackers were then repulsed only by the Katinas family, firing from their weapons. Most of those attacked at the time were members of the Bijucis partisan unit of 1941: Petras Pivoras, Mečys Narušis, Vaclovas Narušis and Jonas Katinas. An action of a similar nature was also carried out by a patrol originating from OP \"Blyskawica\", which on 16 April 1944 requisitioned (against receipt) a weapon and uniform to a member of Lithuanian self-defence unit from Dubinki\nAs a result of a similar action, carried out on 15 April 1944 by the 4th and 5th Home Army Brigades, a communal Lithuanian police station in neighbouring Janiškės, with thirteen policemen and several Shaulis supporting them, was liquidated. During the battle, four Lithuanians were killed and four more were wounded. In this way, the area around Dubinki and Janiszki was permanently cleared of Lithuanian police and Soviet partisans, which provided freedom of action for Polish partisans\nOn 14 March, the brigade received orders to move to the area around Suzan. On 19 March, after a field mass, a review of the 6th Brigade and the \"Blyskawica\" detachment took place in the presence of Commander \"Wilk\". Then Major \"Dąbek\" read out an order from District Commander \"Wilk\" to incorporate the \"Blyskawica\" unit into the 6th Brigade. Major F. Koprowski \"Konar\" was appointed the new commander of the 6th Brigade. \"Tońko\", a former brigade commander, became commander of the 1st company, encompassing the soldiers of the brigade before the merger, Lieutenant \"Piotr\" became commander of the 2nd company, encompassing the former \"Blyskawica\" unit. From then on, the brigade was subordinate only to the District Commander and was called the 6th Wileńska Independent Partisan Brigade of the Home Army.\nOn 25 March 1944, a 20-man detachment of the 7th Brigade under the command of \"Waclaw\" carried out a successful operation on the Wielkie Pole railway station (a few kilometres south of Czarny Bor). The German railway guard post was disarmed and telephone communications were destroyed. The action took place a few minutes before the arrival of a train from Vilnius, in which two wagons of Lithuanian soldiers from the corps of Plechavichius corps (about 80 people). After the arrival of the train at the station, there was a sudden attack of the \"Waclaw\" detachment on these two wagons. The partisans took advantage of the moment of surprise and quickly captured one carriage. In the second, the Lithuanian soldiers defended themselves desperately but briefly and capitulated after a few minutes. The Polish unit captured this action weapons, ammunition and crates of canned goods. The Lithuanians, who had 4 severely and 2 lightly wounded soldiers, were forced to carry the captured supplies. From a nearby village they requisitioned The prisoners were released and quickly retreated into the forest. In less than an hour two lorries arrived from Yashun Germans, but the detachment was already far in the Rudnice Forest, and the Germans at that time were not willing to go into the forest. The attack on the town of Trakai Novi started with a bomb explosion near the barracks in Trakai. At this moment the cavalry began firing at Landvarov and the attention of the German garrison was focused on this detachment. At this time the 3rd Brigade and one platoon of the 7th Brigade struck at Trakai. The remainder of 7 Brigade secured the operation and cut the telephone lines. The Germans and Lithuanians resisted stoutly, but the advantage was on the Polish side. The arsenal was captured, where . All papers and lists were burned. Particularly fierce fighting took place at the capture of the Gestapo and the Lithuanian police barracks. Some Gestapo men defended themselves in the attic of one of the houses until the end and failed to force them to withdraw or lay down their arms. The whole town was in Polish hands. Forty-five Poles were released from the local prison. The 3rd Brigade's soldier Eugeniusz Marszatek \"Dan\" was killed in action, 10 were wounded. The 7th Brigade suffered no losses. A very large number of weapons, ammunition, grenades, uniforms, food, cigarettes and typewriters were captured. In the morning, the brigades set off with a hip carried on a large number of carts and made a 30-kilometre breakaway.\nA few days later, the Lithuanian police noticed a large Polish detachment (according to a police report, the detachment numbered 500-600 men) advancing towards Dukszty. Near Suderva, a skirmish ensued between a Lithuanian detachment, probably from the Plechavicius corps, and a Polish partisan detachment. It was a clash between a horse patrol of the 1st Vilnius Brigade and a detachment of Lithuanian troops. A report from the German security police stated that the skirmish took place in Jurkiszki, located 6 km west of Suderva. One shooter was killed on the Lithuanian side. According to Polish sources, on 20 March 1944, in the village of Antokolce (3 km from Jurkiszki), the 1st Brigade fought a skirmish with General Plechaviczius Lithuanian detachment. A Lithuanian police report stated: \"in the village of Antokolce a reinforcement detachment tracked down a Polish band. During the fight, several bandits were wounded, the rest retreated into the forest. While retreating from a Lithuanian manhunt, the 1st Vilnius Brigade was pinned down on both sides of the Neris River at the end of March. Despite being encircled, the unit crossed the Neris on a ferry near the Lithuanian village of Surmance and broke away from the Lithuanian siege. On 31 March 1944, the First Brigade, without reconnaissance, made a marching attack on a railway bunker in the village of Rykonty, located west of Vilnius on the Vilnius-Kaunas railway line. The action was unsuccessful, the bunker was not captured. When retreating, it was not noticed that a wounded partisan, Henry, was left on the battlefield The wounded partisan Henryk Balbus \"Kondora\" was left on the battlefield and taken prisoner Lithuanian captivity. The wounded \"Kondora\" was tortured by Lithuanian soldiers, his skull was smashed with and handed him over to the German side. \nIn late April and early May 1944, the German authorities decided to transfer a significant part of the police duties in Lithuania to the newly created LTDF formation, which was ordered to initiate a wide anti-partisan operation against the Polish and Soviet partisans in the area. Polish units were commanded to not attack the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, however the Lithuanians attacked polish villages. On May 4th the LTDF launched an assault on the village of Paulava, murdering the local polish community, however the Unit of \"Szczerbiec\" attacked the Lithuanian force killing 12 people and executing 8 after the battle, including the commander Vytautas Narkevicius.\nOn 4 May, in Pavlovo, AK partisans shot LVR company commander Capt. Vytautas Narkevičius236, as responsible for the actions of his subordinates, and two of his non-commissioned officers. Two days later, 6 of the approximately 30 Lithuanian prisoners of war from the 3rd and 4th companies of the 301st LVR Battalion were brought before a field court in Graużyszki. Based on the testimony of witnesses - residents of Adamowszczyzna and Sieńkowszczyzna - they were found by the AK court to be the perpetrators of the murders committed there and sentenced to death. The manner in which the case was handled corresponded to the criminal procedures in force at the time, for the principle was that perpetrators of crimes were punished in court. To this end, the justice apparatus of the Home Army was built up, functioning in the underground as well as in the line partisan units. In accordance with Order No. 5 of the District Commander of 12 April 1944, a Special Military Court was established in each guerrilla unit, with the remit to punish both its own soldiers and captured enemies or civilians if they had committed a crime \nPolish historian Piotr Łossowski claims that the Lithuanian 301st Battalion suffered 47 casualties at Hraŭžyški , and was dispersed by the 8th and 12th AK Brigades on May 5.\nat 6 may he 10th Battalion of the Plechavicius Corps under the command of Major Antanas Andriunas turned to the village of Senkovshchyna from the Oshmyany-Graużyszki route and began murdering civilian inhabitants and burning buildings without reason. Lieutenant Żagle's platoon from the 8th Brigade, going to the aid of the murdered village, furiously attacked the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians, despite being outnumbered, could not stop the attack and began to retreat. The brigade, supported by part of the forces of the 13th Brigade under the command of Adam Walczek \"Nietoperz\", completely smashed the Lithuanian company of the 308th Battalion. The Lithuanians lost a total of 36 soldiers, 12 seriously and 26 lightly wounded, and 224 were taken prisoner. And Polish losses were 3 killed and 20 wounded After the battle, an investigation was conducted and the culprits for the murder of 8 Polish peasants were identified. These individuals were executed.\nThe Lithuanian troops, however, satisfied by their perceived superiority, started suppressing the local Polish communities suspected of harboring the anti-Nazi partisans; numerous war crimes were committed by the LTDF, notably atrocities against Polish civilians in Paulava , Graužiškės and Sieńkowszczyzna. Faced with the need to protect Polish civilians, the AK decided to fight back in early May, and organized a concentrated assault against the fortified Lithuanian positions around the village of Murowana Oszmianka. On 10 May, AK units were ordered to prepare an assault against one of the larger LTDF units in the region.\n\n\n=== Battle of Murowana Oszmianka ===\n\nMain article: Battle of Murowana Oszmianka\nA few days later, at Murowana Oszmianka on the night of 13 to 14 May 1944. The 3rd Brigade of Lt. Gracjan Fróg \"Szczerbiec\" fought a battle with the units of General Povilas Plechavičius. The joint task of Lt. Vytautas Turonek \"Tur\" and \"Szczerbiec\" was to smash two Lithuanian companies in Murowana Oszmianka. The third Lithuanian company, deployed in Tolminów, was to tie up and, in a favourable situation, smash the 13th Brigade of Adam Walczak \"Nietoperz\". The 9th Brigade of Ensign Jan Kolenda 'Maly' and the 12th Brigade of Capt. Hieronim Romanowski 'Cerberus' were providing cover. The 8th \"Tur\" Brigade, after a short firestorm, struck from the east, broke through the defence line and broke into the central part of the town. The 3rd \"Szczerbiec\" Brigade, which was supposed to strike from the west, was late in the action. The other brigades, 9, 12 and 13, stood by to provide cover. In such conditions, the action commander Major Czeslaw Dębicki \"Jarema\" gave the order to the 12th Brigade to support the 8th Brigade. The Lithuanians were pushed out of the southern part of the city, taking about 20 of them prisoner. At around 23:30 the \"Szczerbiec\" brigade struck the town on the march, forcing its way through the western defence line and made contact with the 8th Brigade in the centre of the town with part of its forces. However, most of the platoons of the 3rd Brigade fought a tough battle on the outskirts of Murowana Oshmianka. The \"Millimeter\" platoon encountered very strong resistance and came under massive fire. It was pinned down by enemy fire and suffered heavy losses. The western section, where the 3rd Brigade was advancing, had a well-organised defence. Simultaneously with the 3rd Brigade's strike, the 8th and 12th brigades moved to continue the advance. This was already the final phase of the battle. The enemy's resistance had diminished. The Lithuanians laid down their arms. The enemy lost 23 men killed and over 230 prisoners of war. At the same time as the 8th Brigade, the action in Tolminovo was launched by the 13th \"Bat\" Brigade, which, by attacking part of its own forces and psychologically exploiting the sounds of a firestorm in Murowana Oshmianka, forced the Lithuanian company to lay down its arms. Around 120 soldiers were taken prisoner.\n\n\n=== Lithuanian offensive ===\nIn the first half of May 1944, LVR battalions attempted to recapture rural areas south of the city from Polish hands. This was the first and only LVR armed operation, which ended with a series of defeats inflicted on them by the Home Army: at Pavlov (4 May), at Graużyszki (6 May), at Koniavo (8 May) and at Murowana Oshmika and Tolminovo (13/14 May). As a result of these, around 100 Lithuanian soldiers were killed, many were wounded and several hundred more were disarmed by AK partisans. On 15 May 1944, the Germans withdrew the Lithuanian battalions from action and disbanded the entire formation. This happened both because of the wrong attitude of the Lithuanian soldiers in the Vilnius region, and because of the refusal of the LVR to be strictly subordinated to the German authorities\nThe German occupying forces used the Polish-Lithuanian conflict for their own ends. The progressive reconquest of the countryside by Polish partisans and the threat of handing over the local administration to the Poles were a convenient scare tactic for the Germans to force further concessions on Lithuanian political factors. In their dealings with the Lithuanians and Poles, they also exploited the jointly perceived Soviet threat. On this basis, the Germans conducted secret negotiations and local non-aggression agreements with the local AK leadership.\n\n\n=== Gliciszka Massacre ===\nMain article: Glinciszki massacre\nAfter the battles fought as a reward for the death of 5 Lithuanian policemen, the police came and in a bestial way slaughtered the population, 39 people were killed. A large proportion of the victims were women and children (most of the men had left for work at the time). Employees of the estate, then under the German administration of Landbewirtschaftungsgesellschaft Ostland, already locked up by Lithuanian policemen in the former chapel of the Glincis palace and probably later shot, were saved by the arrival of Germans, representatives of the German administration, who scared off the attackers. The immediate administrator of the estate, Wladyslaw Komar, who came with them, was killed on his way back near Podbrzezie\n\n\n=== Dubingiai massacre ===\nMain article: Dubingiai massacre\nOn 23 June 1944, the 5th Vilnius Brigade of the Home Army attacked a military settlement inhabited by Lithuanian military settlers near the town of Dubinki, which had been established after the parceling out of the Dubinki estate by the Lithuanian authorities in the inter-war period. A bunker defended by Lithuanian policemen was captured by surprise. The resistance put up by Polish partisans when entering the village itself was also broken.retaliatory action was launched. Between 21 and 27 villagers, including women and children, were killed in Dubinki. Writings in Polish and Lithuanian were left next to the corpses, stating that this was in retaliation for the crime in Glinciszki. The events were in retaliation for the death of the inhabitants of Glinciszki \n\n\n== Postwar developments ==\nThe postwar assessment of AK's activities in Lithuania was a matter of controversy. In Communist Poland the actions of AK in general, and particularly the actions of commanders and units operating in Lithuania, were presented in a very negative light (see Cursed soldiers). The Communist regime executed or imprisoned commanders of the AK en masse after the war for political reasons, preventing any fair legal examination of crimes they may have committed during wartime. Zygmunt Szendzielarz \"Łupaszka\", after several years in the postwar underground, was arrested by the Polish Communist authorities, sentenced to death and executed on February 8, 1951, for his anti-communist activities. The assessment of his actions outside of Communist Poland was different, and in 1988 he was posthumously awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military award, by the Polish government in exile. Similarly, the Lithuanian general Povilas Plechavičius who was engaged in fighting the Polish and Soviet partisans received a medal from the Lithuanian president in post-Soviet Lithuania. For these reasons, the AK is considered to be a controversial organisation in today's Lithuania in a manner somewhat similar to the view taken of Soviet partisans. Similarly, in Lithuania, many heroes of Lithuanian resistance against the Soviets are blamed as Nazi collaborators who cooperated in the murder of the Poles and Lithuanian Jewry, which caused controversy in Poland.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nPolish–Ukrainian ethnic conflict\nLithuanian partisans\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adwa Zero KM Project, also called Adwa 00 Project, is a megaproject in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia started in 2019. Named after the Ethiopian victory at the battle of Adwa in 1896, the project hosts a multipurpose facility, including a meeting hall, amphitheater, libraries, and youth centers. The Chinese firm Jiangsu was awarded a bid for construction with 45,000 square kilometers of land in the place of Piassa. On 10 February 2024, the project was completed.\n\n\n== History ==\nAdwa Zero KM Project was named for the commemoration of the Ethiopian victory of Battle of Adwa in 1896. Commenced in 2019, it was due completion within two years, but postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic.   According to the Mayor of Addis Ababa Adanech Abebe, the project was expected to be completed in mid-February 2024, coinciding the 37 scheduled meeting of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The construction was awarded to Chinese contractor Jiangsu for construction of a 45,000 square meter plot in Piassa, which in turn subcontracted out to another Chinese firm contractor Hobart.\nThe project planned to build a meeting hall for the Addis Ababa City Council and other venues like Adwa Memorial Museum, an amphitheater, libraries and youth centers. On 1 March 2022, the project has reached 75% completion according to the Addis Ababa City Administration. It includes structural works. According to the Mega Projects Office Head at the City Administration Engineer Miressa Likessa, the area landed on 3.3 hectare in Addis Ababa with 4.6 billion birr cost to build modern parking that have capacity of accommodating more than 1,000 cars at a time.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The stag (hart, hind or deer) and the vine is a formerly popular and widely translated fable by Aesop. It is numbered 77 in the Perry Index. \n\n\n== The fable and its history ==\nA deer pursued by hunters hides among the vines. While there, it nibbles the leaves of the plant and so betrays its presence to the hunters, who return and kill it. The dying deer acknowledges the righteousness of the divine punishment for ingratitude to its benefactor. The fable has remained more or less unchanged in form since its first appearance in Greek sources.\nFrom the 16th century the fable was frequently retold in Europe. Gabriele Faerno included a Latin poetic version titled Cerva et vitis in his Centum Fabulae (1563), a work that soon became a widely distributed school textbook with a French verse translation. In that century too the fable was taken to Mexico by Spanish colonialists, who translated it into the Aztec language and had to coin the word for 'vineyard' specially from Nahuatl, since plantations had only recently been introduced by the European invaders. Later in the Far East, Portuguese priests related the story in their Japanese compilation of Aesop's Fables, Esopo no Fabulas (1593).\nIn 1666 La Fontaine included the story in the first volume of his fables under the title Le cerf et la vigne, and the story was translated back into Latin verse by J. B. Giraud in his schoolbook of 1775. Then in the following century, another Latin poetic version of the original fable was published in a schoolbook \"intended as a help towards original composition\".\nOne of the earliest English prose versions of the story was titled \"The Hind and the Vine\" and included in Charles Hoole's Aesop's Fables English and Latin (1700). Shortly afterwards it was retold in verse at the end of an essay on ingratitude by Arthur Maynwaring. 18th century compilers of fables retitled the story \"The Hart and the Vine\" and accompanied it with lengthy moral commentaries. By the 19th century that title had become \"The Stag and the Vine\" in a short poem by Brooke Boothby and in Elizur Wright's US translation of La Fontaine's fables. \nMuch earlier, Roger L'Estrange had included the fable in his collection of 1692, accompanied by a political reflexion that alluded to the civil conflicts between monarch and parliament in which he had participated earlier in the century. However, the title of \"The Goat and the Vine\" that he gave it properly belongs to a completely different fable by Aesop in which retribution is threatened but is slower to follow. \n\n\n== References ==",

Very different Well Hung Parliament mixes take care of dance fans.

        "content": "Terry Wayne Forcum (May 4, 1942 – July 26, 2022) was an American golfer who competed as a professional long drive athlete, winning the World Championship in 1983.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nForcum was born in Downey, California, and attended high school in Ponca City, Oklahoma, graduating in 1960.  After high school he competed on the rodeo circuit as a bull rider for four years. In 1964 he was drafted into the United States Army and served two years in Wurzburg, Germany. While serving overseas, Forcum competed in football, baseball, boxing and golf.  After returning to the States, he attended the University of Houston and opened a welding shop in Ponca City, Oklahoma, but continued playing sports recreationally.\n\n\n== Long drive career ==\nForcum first picked up a golf club when he was 10 years old. By age 14-15 he realized that he could hit a golf ball an exceptionally long distance.  He played on the junior high golf team in Ponca City, but opted to play baseball instead in high school. He played in amateur golf tournaments in the 1960s and became a professional golfer in 1975.  Competing in the US National Long Drive Championship, he won 6th place in 1976, 2nd place in 1982, 1st place in 1983 (becoming at age 41 the oldest to do so), and 3rd place in 1988.  His 1983 1st place win at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California earned him the title of World Long Drive Champion for that year – see World Long Drive Championship Winners.  By 1990, he had finished in the top 10 in long drive competitions in eight of the 10 previous years.  He competed in his last National Long Drive Championship in 2008 at the age of 66.\nHis longest competition drive was 369 yards at a competition held in Tokyo, Japan.  He hit a 427-yard drive at a Professional Golfers Association clinic, and his longest recorded drive ever was 547 yards at the Lakeside Golf Course in Ponca City.  He could hit a ball up to 300 yards out of a tee box with a 4 wood, 257 yards with a 7 iron, and once hit a 361-yard drive while on his knees.  He was also known for hitting \"stunt shots\" that included driving a ball through a piece of plywood, and hitting a ball out of a person's mouth.\nA founding member of the 350 Club, the original group of long drivers who toured the world putting on exhibitions and clinics, the Pro Long Drive Association lists him as a pioneer of the long drive sport.\nForcum died in Wichita, Kansas at the age of 80.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPioneers of Long Drive",

In 1700, Romano succeeded Juan de Ugarte as procurator of the Jesuit missions in New Spain. In 1719, he was promoted to provincial superior, an office he held until 1722.\nRomano opposed the founding of the Convent of Corpus Christi in Mexico City for indigenous women. In a 1723 letter, he argued that native women were disinclined to live in community, had a short attention span, and were incapable of keeping a vow of chastity.\nAt the time of his death in 1724, Romano was serving as rector of the Casa Profesa.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Martin Brennan is a fictional character created by the British/Irish comedian Steve Coogan for the critically acclaimed 2019 television sitcom This Time with Alan Partridge, a parody of day-time British shows such as Good Morning Britain and The One Show. The show is hosted by Coogan's long-term fictional character Alan Partridge who is a parody of a tactless and inept television host. In the segment, Brennan is invited as Partridge's doppelganger, but becomes unruly by insulting his host, gifting a tortoise (a protected species) and singing Irish Rebel Songs.\nThe sketch gained controversy in Britain when Coogan was perceived as mocking an Irish stereotype, as well as singing two rebel songs on mainstream British television. However, the performance was very well received in Ireland, with one critic writing that because Coogan is half Irish, Brennan could have become an \"offensive caricature\" but instead become an overnight \"social-media icon\". In an interview, Coogan said that played the character \"in such a way that it would empower Martin and disempower Alan.\"\nBrennan was revived in 2022 for Coogan's touring live show, where he appeared on an overhead screen to interact and sign with Partridge.\n\n\n== Sketch ==\nIn the skit, Partridge and his co-host Jennie (played by Susannah Fielding) interview Martin Brennan, also acted by Coogan, who had been invited onto the show as Partridge's doppelganger, and is presented as a farmer from County Sligo with bad teeth, gelled hair and a heavy brogue accent.\nThe interview quickly becomes unruly as Brennan claims to have never heard of Partridge until a few weeks ago—he had been told that Partridge was a \"famous fella, used to be on the TV way back\", and says he responded to the request for an appearance by asking \"Who the hell is dat\". Brennan begins to sing \"When You Were Sweet Sixteen\", but controversially follows the rendition with segments of the Irish rebel songs \"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\" and \"The Men Behind the Wire\", interrupting the show's planned closing montage of police dogs set to Duran Duran's \"Hungry Like the Wolf\". The political and incendiary lyrics of the rebel songs discomfort Partridge and the other hosts and guests. The piece ends with a visibly upset Partridge whispering to a producer into his microphone \"Oh my god that was like an advert for the IRA. Who are we going to blame? Find out who booked them and sack 'em.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe character has been described as the highlight of This Time and quickly became viral on social-media. The nuance behind the caricature of a West of Ireland bachelor farmer was widely praised by Irish critics and fans. Writing for the Irish Sunday Independent, the critic Pat Stacey titled his review of the episode \"This is what truly great, enduring comedy looks like\".\nThe sketch follows from a 1997 segment on \"I'm Alan Partridge\" where he meets with two Irish RTÉ producers, played by the Father Ted writers Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan, where he says \"Sunday Bloody Sunday. What a great song. It really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday, doesn’t it?\" and remarking that \"Ireland has changed from its abiding image as a land of 'leprechauns, shamrock, Guinness, horses running through council estates, toothless simpletons, people with eyebrows on their cheeks, badly tarmacked drives, in [the UK], men in platform shoes being arrested for bombings, lots of rocks, and, uh, Beamish.\" He finishes by saying in a mock Irish accent that \"I think people are saying, there’s more to Ireland than this. Good slogan for the tourist board. 'Dere’s more teh Oireland dan dis!'\".\n\nCoogan, who was born and raised in Manchester to Irish parents, defended the controversial aspects of the character saying that \"the decisions I make on comedy aren't made on a whim. That whole history between the British and the Irish runs through me. My mother grew up in Mayo and I spent all my summers there\". In contemporary interviews he says that he grew up hearing Irishman jokes and told \"a few\" himself, clarifying that \"all that stuff is important to me. There is a strange thing going on in Ireland with the younger people saying: this is our country.\" He further said that although singing Republican songs on prime time British television had been a comedic goal of his for a number of years, partly born of \"mischief\", he was unsure how it would be taken, and was glad when his mother (Kathleen, née Coonan) \"was relieved that people thought it was great.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMartin Brennan at IMDb",

        "content": "Moruakgomo Sechele was a pretender of the Kwena tribe as the son of kgosi Sebele II. His claim to be kgosi was widely supported in 1962, but it was challenged by his cousin Bonewamang. A court decision disqualified both of them despite acknowledging their claims.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMoruakgomo Sechele was born in Ghanzi to Sebele II, exiled kgosi of the Kwena tribe, and his wife Susan. His year of birth has been reported as 1932 and 1934. Moruakgomo and his younger brother Mokgalagadi were Sebele's only male heirs. In 1940, Moruakgomo and his siblings were baptised in the Anglian church in Molepolole. Sebele died in 1939, and the family moved to Tlokweng where Susan's parents lived. As the son of an exiled leader, Moruakgomo became a pretender after his father's death.\n\n\n== Succession dispute ==\nA succession dispute began when Bakwena kgosi Kgari Sechele II died without an heir in 1962. Moruakgomo was considered a possible successor as his father had been the previous kgosi. His supporters made up a majority of the tribe, and they became known as the letsomane letona (transl. big flock). Among them were interim chief Kenalekgosi and the two living sons of Sechele II, MacIntyre and Mosarwa.\nMoruakgomo's claim was challenged by his cousin Bonewamang, whose father Padi had previously been passed over in the line of succession. Moruakgomo's opponents disliked that his mother was a Coloured woman, and they alleged that Susan had never formally been wed to Sebele, which would make her a concubine who could not produce an heir. Kgari had previously made such allegations as kgosi, but they were unfounded. His detractors also feared that growing up away from the Bakwena would affect his ability to rule and that allowing the child of a polygamous marriage to rule would threaten Christian ideas of marriage. The British colonial administration, citing the 1943 Native Administration Proclamation, sent the dispute to the High Court. In February 1963, it ruled that Moruakgomo was next in line, but that both claimants would be passed over in favour of a compromise candidate, Neale Sechele.\nMoruakgomo died in 1979. His brother Mokgalagadi initiated a legal challenge to have them recognised as the rightful successors in 1999. Mokgalagadi's son Kealeboga continued the challenge after Mokgalagadi's death the following year, but Kgari Sechele III became kgosi in 2002.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMbuya, Titus (1999). \"Legitimacy and Succession in Tswana States: The Case of BaKwena, 1930-1963\".

        "content": "Fuku-chan (フクちゃん) is a manga series by Ryūichi Yokoyama. The yonkoma series appeared in Japanese newspapers from 1936 to 1971, making it one of the longest-running Japanese comic strip series. During the Second World War, three films about Fuku-chan were made for propaganda purposes and in 1982 they were adapted into an anime television series. The character became the mascot of Waseda University.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe series' protagonist is the five-year-old street boy Fukuo “Fuku-chan” Fuchida, who mostly plays pranks on the people around him. Recurring characters include Fuku-chan's friend Kumi, playmate Namiko and her younger brother Kiyo, the cheeky twins Doshako and Garako, and Ganchan, who always annoys the other children at preschool.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe character first appeared in Yokoyama's older series Edokko Ken-chan, where he appeared several times as a mischievous street boy and soon became more popular than the main character. Therefore, the Fuku-chan series started as a spin-off in the Asahi Shimbun in October 1936. It was published throughout the war and was only discontinued in 1971. During the war, some changes were made to conform to propaganda, for example, a \"Forward!\" was added to the title. In the post-war period, the illustrator was reprimanded by censors for his depiction of Americans with red noses.\n\n\n== Film adaptations ==\nA first adaptation of the comic strip as a film was published in 1941 as Fuku-chan no Kishū. The film consisted of one reel of film and was probably a success, as the Navy Department subsequently commissioned the production of two more films that would focus on life at sea. Both propaganda films were released in 1944. The one-reel short film Uwanosora Hakase was made from a script by Yokoyama and directed by Maeda Hajime with a team of 18 over a period of eight months. It was a Navy Department co-production with Asahi Eigasha. The short film has not survived.\nThe second of the two films from 1944 is Fuku-chan no Sensuikan (English: \"Fuku-chan's Submarine\"), a five-reel work that was directed by Mochinaga Tadahito. No other people involved are known and there are conflicting reports about Yokoyama's involvement. For the production, the team was allowed to visit a naval base and a submarine and observe their crew. Some of the observations were incorporated into the film, for example in a cooking scene. A multiplan camera was constructed for production, but could only be used to a limited extent due to the general lack of material and employees.\nAn anime television series followed in 1982, directed by Mineo Fuji at Shin-Ei Animation. The screenplays were written by Masaki Tsuji, Toshiyuki Kashiwakura, Noboru Shiroyama and Hiroko Naka. The character design was created by Ryuichi Yokoyama. The 71 25-minute episodes were broadcast by TV Asahi from November 2, 1982, to March 27, 1984.\n\n\n=== Dubbing ===\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe TV series' music was composed by Hiroshi Tsutsui. The opening song is Boku, Fuku-chan dai! by Chika Sakamoto.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEntry at Anime News Network\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Issa Issaka Aubin, also known as General Aubin (1969 or 1970 - 27 March 2020), was a Central African warlord and the founder of PRNC.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== 2006 - 2013 ===\nAubin, who belongs to the Gula, was born in 1969 or 1970. He joined the UFDR rebel group in 2006 due to the government's neglect of his origin, Vakaga and was appointed as the UFDR chief of staff. \nAubin later joined Séléka and was assigned as the group's chief of staff. He led the Seleka's attack Ndélé in December 2012. On 22 March 2013, he commanded the 1000 Seleka rebels from Damara and Sibut to participate in Battle of Bangui. Aubin was reportedly wounded during a clash with South African forces. On 20 August 2013, he arrested ten looters wearing military uniforms who stole mattresses, televisions, suitcases, and medicines. Djotodia appointed Aubin as the Director of Presidential Security on 9 September 2013.\n\n\n=== 2014 - 2019 ===\nIn 2014, he was part of the coordinator of the Crisis Military Committee of the former Seleka coalition. In April 2014, he released a press release supporting MISCA's DDR process throughout the country and calling the Central Africans to solve their issues for the country's development. In the same month, he signed the agreement with the government on behalf of ex-Seleka that allowed the authorities to transfer former Seleka's members to encampments in Sibut before returning to their origins. However, it sparked controversies among the ex-Seleka. They rejected the agreement signing since they did not get involved in the discussion.\nIn the unknown year, Aubin joined RPRC and became one of the group's military leaders. He commanded the PRNC's attack at the Anti-balaka base in Bria , which eliminated its commander, Theophile Ndoumba, on 25 September 2018. However, he was disgruntled by the RPRC leader, Ahaba's action of signing the peace agreement. Apart from that, he was one of the signatories of the Gula-Peuhl Peace Agreement in Bria as a Gula representative on 3 May 2018.\n\n\n=== 2019 - 2020 ===\nDue to the tension with Ahaba, Aubin founded PRNC on 28 May 2019 in Tiringoulou and designated Nourd Gregaza as the group's leader. He became the PRNC's spokesperson and chief of staff. Aubin and MLCJ's chief of staff, Ali Abderahmane, prepared and commanded the attack in Birao, Tissi, and Am Dafok. He sent his forces from Tiringoulou to partake in the attack. Apart from that, he also attempted to forge alliances with Noureddine Adam and Mahamat Al-Khatim.

It is the largest tributary of the Sinapovska reka and is longer than the latter.\nThe river takes its source under the name Tekirya at an altitude of 203 m in the Svetliyski Heights, some 1.3 km southeast of the village of Pitovo. Along its entire length, it flows in a shallow valley with a sandy bed and with a very small longitudinal slope (0.15 m/km). In its upper course, the flows through the western part of the Yambol Field, initially in eastern direction until  the village of Boyadzhik, and then in southeastern direction to General Inzovo, where its bed is corrected with water protection dikes. The Kalnitsa then winds around the Manastirski Heights from the east and downstream of the village of Pchela flows through the western part of the Elhovo Field with numerous meanders. It flows into the Sinapovska reka at an altitude of 97 m just one kilometer west of the latter's confluence with the Tundzha.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 577 km2 or 66.25% of the Sinapovska reka's total. \nThe Kalnitsa has predominantly rain feed with high water in autumn and winter. The average annual flow is at the village of Krumovo is 1.65 m3/s.\nThe river flows entirely in Sliven, Yambol and Haskovo Provinces.

        "content": "Estonia is set to participate at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Madrid, Spain. Estonian broadcaster ERR is responsible for the country's participation in the contest and chose Annabelle Ats to represent the country through the national selection Tähtede lava.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEstonia debuted in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. ERR had previously broadcast the contest in 2003 and 2004, however cited financial reasons for Estonia's absence from participation in the junior contest in the years running up to their debut appearance. Broadcasters from the Baltic countries, including Estonia, expressed interest in taking part in the 2016 contest, which never materialised. ERR internally selected Arhanna to represent the country in 2023, with her song \"Hoiame kokku\" also being internally selected and released at a later date. At the contest Arhanna finished 15th with 49 points.\nERR's head of entertainment Karmel Killandi, while interviewing Arhanna, Estonia's representative in the previous contest, said that she \"opened the door\" for artists to \"perform in front of this huge audience\" in future years, suggesting that Estonia could take part in 2024. On 24 November 2023, ahead of the country's debut in the contest, Estonian broadcaster ERR said that it would be looking into the possibilities of making the singing competition Tähtede lava its national final for Junior Eurovision. This was confirmed the following 4 May, ahead of the final of Tähtede lava.\n\n\n== Before Junior Eurovision ==\n\n\n=== Tähtede lava 2024 ===\nERR selected the Estonian representative with the biennial television program Tähtede lava; the 2022 series of the show was won by Arhanna, who also won in her younger category in 2019, which motivated her selection to represent the country on its debut appearance in 2023, All shows were hosted by Jaagup Tuisk and Aaron Thor Härm and directed by Kristo Veinberg.\n\n\n==== Contest overview ====\nThe 2024 series of the competition commenced on 7 April, together with the selection show of the youngest age category, which consisted of singers aged between 3 and 7 years old, and continued the following week with the selection show of the middle age category, consisting of 8 to 10 year olds, being held on 14 April; the eldest age category for singers aged between 11 and 13 years old had a selection show held on 21 April, where the three artists with the most points qualified to the final directly and an additional wildcard finalist was chosen according to the public votes. The winners of the two younger age categories were revealed during a live show, called the \"first final\", held on 28 April, while the winner of the eldest category, as well as the Estonian representative in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, was selected on 5 May during the so-called \"second final\".\nFollowing a total of eight performances (two per each finalist: one solo performance and one featuring a well-known Estonian performer), the winner of the second final was determined by a combination of votes from the public and a six-member jury panel composed of Sirje Medell (singing and music teacher), Kadri Hunt (conductor, singing teacher), Robert Linna (musician), Ewert Sundja (musician, songwriter), Alice Aleksandridi (choreographer) and Maris Aljaste (organiser of Tallinna laste jazzifestival Kräsh). At the end of the show, 13 year-old Annabelle Ats was announced as the winner of Tähtede lava's eldest age category.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph \"Shad\" Araby (May 13, 2024 – August 17, 2006) was an American veteran, custodian, and supporter of Dedham youth, particularly Dedham High School athletics.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAraby was born in Dedham, Massachusetts. As a student at Dedham High School, Araby earned the nickname \"Shad\" from humming the Louis Armstrong song Shadrack. He was the water boy for the football team and served on the Boosters Club. After graduating from Dedham High School in 1942, Araby joined the United States Navy and served in World War II. He had a son, Frank, two grandchildren, a brother, James, and two sisters, Edith and Frances. \nHe was a member of the Italian American Citizens Club of Dedham. He enjoyed sports, reading, and jazz music.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter being discharged from the Navy, Araby took a position as an equipment manager for the Boston Red Sox. He then took a janitorial position at Dedham High School in 1959. He would remain at his alma mater for 31 years, retiring in 1990. He then was elected as a trustee of the Dedham Public Library.\n\n\n== Supporter of Dedham youth ==\nAraby was a passionate supporter of Dedham High School sports and did not miss a football or basketball game in many decades. While in the Navy, he went AWOL in order to watch the Dedham-Norwood rivalry football game. For a lifetime of support, he was a member of the first class of inductees to the Dedham High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.\nAraby supported anything to do with Dedham youth, including the St. Mary's LifeTeen program. Araby was the first member of the Dedham High School Alumni Association's Shiretown Club. A party for his 75th birthday was a fundraiser to build a skate park behind the Dedham Pool.\nAfter retiring, Araby volunteered at the Dedham Middle School, handing out sticks of Juicy Fruit gum and helping students who were having a tough day. He had a special focus on students from broken homes, trying to set a good example for them. When the Middle School hosted a \"grandfather's coffee,\" where students interviewed their grandfathers and then invited them into the school for a special event, Araby would stand in for students' whose grandfathers were not able to attend.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHe died on August 17, 2006. His funeral was held at St. Mary's Church on August 19, and he was buried at Brookdale Cemetery.\nThe access road to the Dedham High School gym is named \"Shad and Wendy's Way\" for Araby and Wendell Clement. A tree in front of the High School was dedicated in his honor, and then rededicated on May 13, 2024, on what would have been Araby's 100th birthday. The Shad Araby Award is given each year to a staff member of the Dedham Public Schools who shows a dedicated effort to support the students. The Dedham High School Booster's Club awards the Shad Araby Memorial Athletic Scholarship to a graduating senior each year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harry Metcalf Locke (February 20, 1902 – October 15, 1974) was a Republican state senator from Colorado, U.S. He served in the state senate for 23 years, from 1951 to 1974. Born in Trinidad, Colorado, he later moved to Hartsel, Colorado and worked first as a car salesman and later for the South Park Mercantile Company.\n\n\n== Elections ==\nLocke first ran for state office in 1950, seeking to represent District 6 in the Colorado Senate. He won the Republican primary and the general election and began serving in the state senate in January 1951. He was re-elected in 1954, 1958, and 1962. Following 1960 redistricting, he moved to Salida, Colorado and won election there to represent District 15 in 1966. In 1970, he began representing Senate District 30. Then, following 1970 redistricting, he ran for election to District 33.\nHowever, Locke died in office on October 15, 1974, while seeking election to Senate District 33. He won the Republican primary in the month prior to his death. A vacancy committee selected John B. Shawcroft, his primary opponent, as the Republican candidate for the general election, but the general election ballots had already been printed. Democrat Martin Hatcher won the election.\nDuring his term in the senate, he served as chair of the powerful Joint Budget Committee, was vice-chair of the Senate Appropriations and State Affairs committees, and was a member of the Agriculture, Livestock, and Natural Resources Committee. A memorial published in the senate journal in the year following his passing stated he was \"one of the most respected legislators to have ever served our state.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLocke was married to Marguerite Locke. They had no children. The Harry M. Locke Dam at Georgetown Lake in Georgetown, Colorado is named for him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLocke's campaign history from the Colorado Secretary of State\nLegislative Branch page about Locke",

It is made from puréed or minced meats and vegetables which are then thickened with flour, eggs, and sometimes cream. The batter is then shaped and divided into smaller portions and sautéed in clarified butter. Subrics are usually accompanied with a white sauce such as béchamel  or allemande sauce. They are usually served as an hors-d’œuvre, amuse-bouch, or a side for various dishes. They can also be made sweet and served as a dessert. \nThe recipes for subric first appeared in the 19th century in French chef Urbain Dubois' La Cuisine classique. They became popular at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench cuisine\nCroquettes\nPancakes\nCrêpe\nGalettes\nList of French dishes\nhors-d’œuvres\nFood portal",

        "content": "Nonkina Tōsan  (ノンキナトウサン; also spelled  呑気なとうさん or のんきな父さん, Easygoing Dad or Carefree Dad) is an early manga comic strip by Yutaka Asō, first published in 1923, in the newspaper Hochi Shinbun.\nThe strip follows the antics created by the main character “Nonkina Tōsan (Easygoing Daddy)” and his partner “Neighbor Taishō\" ( Tonari no Taishō (隣のタイショウ) ”. Inspired by American comics, especially Bringing Up Father, was one of the pioneering yonkoma,  becoming a success, generating a number of merchandising items and adaptations to animated shorts and feature films.\n\n\n== History ==\nNonkina Tōsan was originally an eight-panel cartoon titled “呑気なとうさん” (renamed “のんきな父さん” from the May 27 issue of the same year and changed to a six-panel cartoon from the October 28 issue of the same year) that had been serialized irregularly in the “Sunday Manga ” section of the Hochi Shimbun since April 29, 1923. In an attempt to soothe the pain of the people affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake in September of that year and the chronic recession that preceded it, Tomoichirō Takada, then editorial director of the Hochi Shimbun, considered serializing a cheerful comic strip in the paper and selected the work by Asō, a rookie comic strip artist. At the time, George McManus' Bringing Up Father, (serialized as Oyaji Kyoiku in Asahi Graph) was a popular comic strip, and Aso was reluctant to start serializing it, saying that he did not think he could compete with it in any way, but eventually accepted.\nAfter the serialization began, the circulation of Hochi Shimbun increased, and Asō became a popular manga artist. The color version of the book became a bestseller, and it became a social phenomenon at the end of the Taishō era, with advertisements using characters and merchandise such as dolls and hand towels being created. It has even become a buzzword, with men with a carefree demeanor being called nontou (ノントウ). In October 1926, the series ended temporarily due to Asō's trip to Europe. After returning to Japan, in 1929, serialization resumed under the title Zoku Nonkina tosan (続ノンキナトウサン)  in  the Yomiuri Sunday Manga page of the Sunday edition of Yomiuri Shimbun.\nFrom the November 26 issue of the same year, it was moved to the Yukan Hochi Shimbun, with the title changed to ノンキナトウサン and the format changed to a 4-panel comic, serialized every day on the top left of the front page. It seems that the panel layout, speech bubbles, and simplified character depictions were influenced by Bringing Up Father, and in the early serializations, the dialogue was written horizontally and in katakana. Over the course of the series, the panel layout changed from 2x2 to 1x4 vertically.\nAfter the war, in 1945, Asō serialized ``Nonkina tosan'' again in Daiichi Shimbun. Asō died in 1961, so the copyright ended before 2019, when the copyright was extended to 70 years after the author's death, and the work entered the public domain.\n\n\n== Films ==\nRyūgūmairi\nNonkina Tōsan ryūgūmairi ( ノンキナトウサン 竜宮参り; Carefree Dad's visit to Ryūgū palace ) is a Japanese short silent animated film produced and released in 1925. Written and directed by Hakuzan Kimura. Produced by Azuma Eigasha (Takamatsu Azuma Production) and Asahi Cinema.\n\n\n=== Hanami no maki ===\n\nNonkina Tōsan Hanami no Maki (ノンキナトウサン 花見の巻; Carefree Dad's Cherry blossom viewing reel)  is a Japanese feature film produced in 1925 ) and released on September 18 of the same year. Starring Gokurō Soganoya. Directed by Ryōha Hatanaka. It was produced and independently distributed by Sanjuzo Naoki (later Sanjugo Naoki)'s United Motion Picture Artists Association. It was released as a double feature with 'Nonkina Tōsan Activity Volume, mentioned below.\n\n\n=== Katsudo no maki ===\n\nNonkina Tōsan  Katsudo no maki (ノンキナトウサン 活動の巻 Carefree Dad's Activity Reel )is a Japanese feature-length film produced in 1925  and released on September 18 of the same year. Directed by Tokuji Ozawa. Starring Gokuro Soga. It was released as a double feature with the above-mentioned ``Nonkina Tōsan Hanami no Maki''.\n\n\n=== Nonkina tōsan ===\n\nNonkina tōsan (のんきな父さん) is a Japanese feature-length film produced and released in 1946., directed by  Masahiro Makino, starring Isamu Kosugi. Produced by Shochiku Kyoto Studio.\nAt the end of Masahiro Makino's time as director of Shochiku Kyoto Studio, two projects were approved: this film and Kenji Mizoguchi's Utamaro and his Five Women. Makino cranked up this work in October, but at that time Mizoguchi had just begun preparations. At the time, the studio did not have a labor union, but that was because Makino was the director, and it was on the verge of organizing a union. After the production of this work, Makino headed to Shochiku headquarters with his resignation letter in hand, and when he returned after it was accepted, an employee union was formed and Makino was appointed as the chairman. He had no choice but to go on strike for a week and negotiated his demands with the head office. After the strike, Mizoguchi cranked up ``Utamaro'' in just one week, and completed each work. Both films were produced with Makino's personal loans. After they were completed, he previewed both films to his vice president, Shiro Kido, and had them purchased at a reasonable price. Employee demands through strikes were also accepted.\nThe film was shot with a baseball game scene featuring 25 professional baseball players, including Katsuhiko Haida's best friend Takehiko Bessho. Among the many singers who made special appearances in this film, Miss Wakana suddenly died of a heart attack on October 14 of the same year, shortly after filming.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNonkina tōsan page at the Oita Prefectural Museum of History (in Japanese)\nNonkina tosan ryugu mairi at IMDb \nNonkina tosan ryugu mairi at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nNonkina Tôsan - Hanami no maki at IMDb \nNonkina Tôsan - Hanami no maki at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nNonkina Tôsan - Katsudô no maki at IMDb \nNonkina Tôsan - Katsudô no maki at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nNonkina Tōsan at IMDb \nNonkina tōsan at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Comment: Needs cleanup per WP:MOS, and more references for denoting notability. The Herald (Benison) (talk) 10:35, 8 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nMovement ecology is a sub discipline of ecology that focuses on studying the movement behavior of individuals and the the coordinated movement of groups of individuals. It seeks to understand the effects of both external environmental factors (e.g.: weather, landscape topography, and resource distributions; presence of conspecific and heterospecific predators,  competitors, and symbionts) and internal individual-state factors (e.g., hunger, thirst, physiology, and state-of-mind drivers) on when, where and why individuals move to known and unknown places.  Although animal movement studies can be traced back to Aristotle (4th century B.C.), and even Jeremiah who described the temporal consistency of bird migratory patterns in the 7th century B.C., a unifying paradigm for studying the movement of organisms was only formulated around 2007..\n\nResearchers in the field of movement ecology use various technologies, including Global Positioning Systems (GPS), reverse GPS tracking, tri-axial accelerometer  and physiological (e.g. temperature) data retrieved from sensors place on individuals remote sensing, and mathematical modeling, to monitor and analyze the movement tracks of individuals. A review of recent trends in movement ecology included the following graphic on the history of movement ecology research publications, highlighting critical events in this history. \n\nBy studying movement ecology, scientists can gain insights into the spatial ecology of organisms, the impacts of habitat fragmentation and climate change on animal movements, and the conservation of migratory species.\n\n\n== DATA SOURCES ==\nThe focal dataset in movement ecology is a relocation time series\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              T\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              l\n              o\n              c\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        {\n        (\n        t\n        ;\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          |\n        \n        t\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n        ⋯\n        ,\n        T\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {T}}^{\\rm {loc}}=\\{(t;x_{t},y_{t})|t=0,\\cdots ,T\\}}\n  \n\nwhose properties can either be studied on its own using the methods of time series analysis or in the context of landscape  and other (e.g., accelerometer data, an individual's internal state) covariates of the individual's location in time and space. The earliest such time series were collected using radio telemetry and in the 1960's included movement data from wild porcupines and grizzly bears . From the early 2000s, the automated collection of animal movement relocation time series data became increasingly prevalent, collected at increasingly higher frequencies and for increasingly longer periods of time so that today movement ecology has entered the Big data era of science. \nIn the tradition of data sharing in science the data portal Movebank was established in 2012 as repository for sharing data, particularly in support of studies reporting and analyzing movement data in the scientific literature..  As of April 2024, this repository included more than 8,200 studies containing data on more than 6.3 billion location points.\n\n\n== DERIVED TIME SERIES ==\nThe two most important time series in movement ecology that that can be derived from \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              T\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              l\n              o\n              c\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {T}}^{\\rm {loc}}}\n  \n defined above are the step length (SL) and heading direction time series (DH).  In terms of using these time series for analyses, the step length time series is more often referred to as the velocity, \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n, time series,  though this only holds true if the times series is collected using a fixed time interval that sets a fixed frequency, \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n  \n, of collection, thereby allowing the speed of movement to be computed using the speed=frequency\n  \n    \n      \n        ×\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\times }\n  \ndistance-moved relationship.

which is maximized when there is no change in heading, or minimized and negative when direction is reversed) and tangential velocity (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n        =\n        v\n        sin\n        ⁡\n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v^{T}=v\\sin \\theta }\n  \n, which is maximized when a complete right or left turn is made).\n\n\n== MOVEMENT MODES AND PATH SEGMENTATION ==\nIdentifying the current behavioral movement state or movement mode is a central theme of many movement ecology studies. Various types of path segmentation methods are used to identify the behavioral states associated with points along the movement track time series \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              T\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              l\n              o\n              c\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {T}}^{\\rm {loc}}}\n  \n.  The most popular two methods are behavioral change point analysis (BCPA) and hidden Markov models (HMM).\nMore recently, a hierarchical track structure approach has been proposed as a way to use information theory to assess the performance of hierarchical path segmentation methods",

He is most noted for his short film Inséparables, which was the winner of the Prix Jutra for Best Live Action Short Film at the 3rd Jutra Awards in 2001, and as one of the writers of The Vinland Club (Le Club Vinland), for which he was a Prix Iris nominee for Best Screenplay at the 23rd Quebec Cinema Awards in 2021.\nHe began his career in film, making the short films La Mémoire infidèle (1995), L'Hypothèse rivale (1997) and Inséparables (2000), before leaving the film industry to pursue scientific work as a biologist and professor at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique. After conceiving the idea for The Vinland Club, a film about a scientific project undertaken by a professor and his students, Bergeron approached director Benoît Pilon and screenwriter Marc Robitaille to collaborate on the film, which was released in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNormand Bergeron at IMDb",

        "content": "May Isabella Weatherly born May Isabella Bird (22 May 1868 – 2 November 1950) was an Australian headmistress. She was the founding principal of what became the Invergowrie Homecraft Hostel. \n\n\n== Life ==\nWeatherly was born in 1868 in Ballarat, Victoria. Her mother was Helen (born Chisholm in Scotland) and her clergyman and politician father was Bolton Stafford Bird. She had some of her education in Tasmania and the rest at the Methodist Ladies College in Kew. After her education was complete she was employed by the college as a teacher until 1895. She taught and continued to teach even after she enrolled in the University of Tasmania. She graduated in 1904 and became Senior Mistress at Queen's College in Ballarat.\nIn 1907 she left her first headship after only a few months in order that she could marry a Scottish-born widower with five daughters. She was nearly forty and he was sixty seven years old. They lived at Stawell in Victoria where her new husband was a grazier.\nIn 1929 a homecraft hostel was opened in a small villa in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern and Weatherly was the first principal. Initially there was just four girls and two of those were not boarding where it was based. In 1933 W. E. McPherson gave his father's Invergowrie House to be used by the hostel. By this time she had a co-principal who was Margaret Kirkhope. They led the hostel together until 1938 when Weatherly retired.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nWeatherly died at her home in Malvern, Victoria in 1950. The hostel then had 62 students and 42 of those were boarders. The Invergowrie Homecraft Hostel stayed open until 1973 after 2,000 students had passed through its doors. The hostel was sold and the money became the Invergowrie Foundation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

The party won 22 seats in the 1937 United Provinces legislative assembly election and won four seats in legislative councils. Established in 1934 in both Agra and Oudh, the National Agriculturist Party initially existed primarily on paper. Until 1936, it relied on the personal influence of its members to maintain its presence. The party was formed with the support of zamindars and talukdars from both Hindu and Muslim communities, and it received backing from landlord class.\nIt comprised two factions, the National Agriculturist Party of Agra (NAPA) and the National Agriculturist Party of Oudh (NAPO). The National Agriculturist Party received backing from the British government. Initially supportive of British interests, these parties later played important roles in backing communal organisations within the province. \nDuring the 1937 election, although the Indian National Congress won a majority of seats, they declined to form a government. Consequently, on 1 April 1937, the Muhammad Ahmad Said Khan Chhatari (the Nawab of Chhatari), the leader of the National Agriculturist Parties, was invited to form a minority provisional government.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1937 Indian provincial elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sirtica campaign, or Sirte campaign, was a military campaign executed by the Regio Esercito that took place between November 1924 and March 1925. It was one of the first actions during the Second Italo-Senussi War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Italy found itself in difficulty in maintaining control over its territory in Fezzan where, moreover, was the activity of the Senussi rebels who were supported by Turkish garrisons led by commander Enver Bey, who remained in Libya even after the signing of the peace treaty. In December 1914, therefore, all the Italian military garrisons in Fezzan were abandoned, including the one of Brak, where the forces had been concentrated before the retreat. Since then, Italian dominion remained precarious and limited to a narrow coastal strip. During the conflict, Italy withdrew part of its troops and dismantled the garrisons in the interior of the two regions, also because of the defeats at Gasr Bu Hadi and Sidi Abu Arqub, while it maintained its coastal garrisons in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica to counter Senussi offensives who were supported by Ottoman and German supplies. After the campaign, which ended in a Central Powers defeat, a new conflict rose up, which would totally confirm Italian rule in Libya.\n\n\n== Course of the Campaign ==\nTo regain possession of northern Tripolitania, all that was needed was the reoccupation of Sirtica, in which leaders and armed men from the newly conquered territories had taken refuge. The Governor deemed it appropriate this time to precede a brief political preparation, through which numerous people from Misuratino and Orfella were able to return to their countries. Then, decided to act energetically. The task was given to Colonel Mezzetti who, concentrating his forces including 3 battalions, 3 squadrons, 1 battery, and other elements near Misrata, advanced along the western coast of Great Sirte and, after defeated some light enemy resistance at Gasr Bu Hadi (south of Sirte itself), entered Sirte on 23 November 1924. With these actions, after 35 months of prudent political and military action, the cycle that brought all of northern Tripolitania back under direct Italian rule was closed. Since then, the activity of the Government of Tripolitania was dedicated to the preparation of the troops and especially to the establishment of special Saharan units, as well as to the political-military organization of the territory with the establishment of \"civil police stations\" in the Gebel area and with the creation of the «Command of the territories of the southern Tripoli area».\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWright, John (1983).

The station was opened on May 26, 2023, following three months of construction. The station primarily caters to guests visiting Karls Erlebnisdorf Rövershagen. The construction of a station for Karl's Erlebnisdorf near Rövershagen had been planned since 2019 but was stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The construction of the station required an investment of approximately 1.7 million euros, with the majority of the funding provided by the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Additionally, Robert Dahl, owner of Karls Erlebnisdorf, contributed to the financing of the project. In the maiden regional train, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Minister President, Manuela Schwesig (SPD), sat among approximately 200 guests. The inauguration of the station marked a significant milestone for the region's transportation infrastructure. It became the 180th railway station to be integrated into Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Deutsche Bahn railway network.\nThe station is served by the RB 12 line, which connects the station towards Graal-Müritz and Rostock. Two train pairs also operate to Ribnitz-Damgarten West. The trains are operated by DB Regio Nordost.\n\n\n== Train Services ==\nThe station is served by the following services:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStreckenfahrplan RB 12\nDeutsche Bahn website",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Tynemouth Lifeboat Station is located on the River Tyne, at Fish Quay, North Shields, in the county of Tyne and Wear.\nA lifeboat was first stationed across the River Tyne in South Shields in 1789, with a second lifeboat placed in North Shields in 1798, both operated by the Tyne Lifeboat Institution (TLI).\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) currently operates a Severn-class lifeboat 17-34 Osier (ON 1263), and a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat Little Susie (D-829).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 1700s, two lifeboats were operated at Tynemouth by the Tyne Lifeboat Institution (TLI), both built by Henry Greathead, to an amalgamated design of both Greathead and William Wouldhave. At the time, the mouth of the River Tyne was particularly treacherous in poor weather, many ships lost, but many lives saved.\nSafety would be radically improved in later years, with the construction of the North and South Tyne Piers, building starting in 1854, but only completed in 1910.\nThe first lifeboat, known as Original, was wrecked in 1830. The Tyne Lifeboat Institution would not have the funds for a replacement until 1833. In 1832, a request for a lifeboat was placed by the Port of Newcastle Shipwreck Association with the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), who supplied a 26-foot Palmer-type non-self-righting lifeboat, arriving in October 1832, to be managed by the TLI. A new boathouse had been constructed at Prior's Haven. The boat was on service for 10 years, until it was badly damaged in 1842, and scrapped.\n\nThe Tyne Institution would maintain their fleet of lifeboats, providing 2 new boats and a new boathouse at South Beach, South Shields, in 1841–2. On 4 December 1849, the Tyne Institution lifeboat Providence was launched to the aid to the brig Betsy, which had run ashore at Herd sands. Whilst alongside the vessel, the Providence was capsized. Tyne was launched, and picked up three survivors still holding onto the Providence, and North Shields lifeboat Northumberland rescued the crew of the Betsy, plus one lifeboat man who had managed to get aboard. 20 of the 24 crew of the Providence were lost.\nIt was as a result of this disaster that Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, of Alnwick Castle, president of the RNIPLS, set a competition for the design of a Self-righting lifeboat, which was won by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth. This design would become the basis for lifeboats for many years afterwards.\nIn 1862, following a series of shipwrecks in and around Prior's Haven, it was suggested that the (now) RNLI should place a lifeboat at a new station at Prior's Haven. A new boathouse was constructed, and the Constance, a 33-foot self-righting 10-oared lifeboat, arrived in November 1862. The Prior, a TLI boat, was relocated from Prior's Haven to South Beach, South Shields.\nFollowing the wreck of the Stanley in 1864, it was decided to place a second lifeboat at Tynemouth, with the RNLI building a new station at Black Middens. Both lifeboat services would operate alongside each other until the early 1900s, often responding to the same shipwreck, one or other standing by while a rescue was performed. However, in 1905, everything changed when the RNLI placed a motor-powered lifeboat at Tynemouth, followed soon after by the completion of the Piers. A motor lifeboat was far better placed to respond, and fewer rescues were required, with the mouth of the River Tyne now protected. The TLI would be renamed the Tyne Lifeboat Society (TLS) in 1905, maintaining the last of their lifeboats until the 1940s. The RNLI No.2 station was closed.\nAfter some years with the motor lifeboat moored afloat, the RNLI took over a boathouse belonging to the War-office in 1921. It was located right next to the Tyne Lifeboat Society boathouse at Clifford's Fort. The lifeboat was mounted on a trolley, which could be winched up or down a trolley-way. In 1941, bombs dropped in a war-time air-raid destroyed the Tyne Lifeboat house, containing the James Young lifeboat, and the RNLI boathouse, containing the John Pymont (ON 824). A replacement boathouse and slipway would be constructed at the same location in 1947.\nTo commemorate the centenary of the Tynemouth lifeboat station, a stained glass window, showing a picture of the Original lifeboat, was unveiled by Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland at the Seamen's Chapel of Christ Church, North Shields on 16 September 1962.\n1965 would see the arrival of the first Tynemouth Inshore lifeboat, one of the earliest inshore D-class (RFD PB16) boats numbered D-12. When a new All-weather Arun-class lifeboat arrived in 1980, the boat would once again be moored afloat. A replacement station building, housing the Inshore lifeboat, launched with the use of a davit, and a mooring for the All-weather boat were provided in 1997. A 25-knot Severn-class lifeboat 17-20 Spirit of Northumberland (ON 1242) would be placed on service in 1999. After serving 22 years, she would be removed from service, and sent to the RNLI Headquarters at Poole, to be the second Severn-class boat to receive what is known as a SLEP upgrade (Severn Life Extension Programme), to allow a further 25 years of service.\nThe Tyne lifeboat of the Tyne Lifeboat Institution is restored and on display at South Shields. The Bedford lifeboat of the Tyne Lifeboat Institution has been restored, and is in storage awaiting a suitable display location.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Tynemouth\n\nRNLI Gold Medal\nCapt.

        "content": "Shimei ben Gera is a Biblical figure from the Book of II Samuel and the Book of I Kings. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was related to King Saul. II Samuel relates that when King David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei cursed him as he passed through the village of Bahurim: \n\n5. And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. 6. And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 7. And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; 8. the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.' \nShimei's curse has been interpreted as referring to the killing of Abner ben Ner and the death of Ish-bosheth, King Saul's general and son. Alternatively, other interpretation attribute Shimei's animosity to David from the fact that he saw David as the one who removed Saul's family from the throne.\nThe Talmud says that Shimei cursed David because of his sin with Bathsheba, calling him an adulterer, a Moabite, a murderer, an oppressor, and an abomination.\nAbishai ben Zeruiah, David's military leader, wanted to kill Shimei on the spot, but David did not permit him.\n\n9. Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' 10. And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?' 11. And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him. 12. It may be that the Lord will look on mine eye, and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.' 13. So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. \n\nAfter David's army defeated Absalom's force, as he crossed back over the Jordan River to return to Jerusalem, Shimei came with about 1,000 men to ask him for forgiveness. Once again, Abishai asked permission to kill Shimei, but David forgave him. Some scholars attribute David's forgiveness to the desire to make peace with the Tribe of Benjamin. \nAccording to Yalkut Shimoni, Shimei addressed David as follows: \"The brothers of Joseph did him injury, but Joseph returned good for evil. Be thou as Joseph, and recompense me with good, though I dealt evilly with thee. It was not I alone but all Israel that entreated thee ill. They now await my fate, and if thou forgivest me, they will come and make peace with thee and surrender themselves to thee\" (Yalḳ. ii. 151)\nHowever, on his deathbed, David instructed his son Solomon to deal appropriately with Shimei and punish him for his actions.\nSolomon followed his father's instructions. He ordered Shimei to move to Jerusalem and forbade him to leave the city on pain of death. For three years, Shimei obeyed the order and remained in Jerusalem, but after three years he left to pursue two slaves who escaped to the kingdom of Achish, king of Gath. When he returned to Jerusalem, Solomon had him put to death.\n\n\n== In rabbinic Judaism ==\nThe Talmud records different opinions about Shimei. According to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami citing Ulla, Shimei was Solomon's teacher. The Talmud further states that as long as Shimei was alive, Solomon refrained from marrying Pharaoh's daughter and other foreign wives. The statement instructs that this shows that a person should always live in the same place as his teacher.\nIn contrast, Midrash Rabba describes Shimei was wicked. He is listed alongside the wicked kings of Judah, Ahaz and Amon. All three were spared by God because of the righteous children who would be descended from them. According to this midrash, Mordecai was descended from Shimei. In Yalkut Shimoni it states that the reason David did not kill Shimei was that he was with the Holy Spirit that Mordechai would come from him and would save the Jewish people. \nIn Midrash Shmuel and Yalkut Shimoni it is the merit of Shimei's wife that saved Shimei and Mordechai, and by extension the Jews of Persia from Haman's decrees. These midrashim relate that she hid and protected Jonathan ben Abiathar and Ahimaaz ben Zadok when they had been sent by Hushai the Archite to tell David of Absalom's plans and were being pursued by the rebellious king's men.\nRashi writes that Shimei ben Gera was the head of the Sanhedrin.\n\n\n== In Josephus ==\nJosephus includes the story of David and Shimei in his Antiquities of the Jews, putting the following words in David's mouth:\n\n \"Let us not,\" said he, \"bring upon ourselves another fresh misfortune to those we have already, for truly I have not the least regard nor concern for this dog that raves at me: I submit myself to God, by whose permission this man treats me in such a wild manner; nor is it any wonder that I am obliged to undergo these abuses from him, while I experience the like from an impious son of my own; but perhaps God will have some commiseration upon us; if it be his will we shall overcome them.\" \n\n\n== In Christianity ==\nThe Nicene Fathers cite David's forgiveness of Shimei as a paradigm of restraining anger and of silence and humility.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_X/Works/On_the_Duties_of_the_Clergy/Book_I/Chapter_6\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAbraham Lincoln referred to David's forgiveness of Shimei when asked how he would deal with the South after the Civil War: \n\nJudge Gillespie of Edwardsville, Ill. says: \"I asked him [Lincoln] once what was to be done with the South after the Rebellion was put down. He said some thought their heads ought to come off; 'but,' said he, 'if it was left to me, I could not tell where to draw the line between those whose heads should come off and those whose heads should stay on.' He said that he had been recently reading the history of the rebellion of Absalom, and that he inclined to adopt the views of David. 'When David was fleeing from Jerusalem, Shimei cursed him. After the Rebellion was put down, Shimei craved a pardon. Abishai, David's nephew, the son of Zeruiah, David's sister, said: \"This man ought not to be pardoned, because he cursed the Lord's anointed.\" David said: \"What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries unto me? Know ye that not a man shall be put to death in Israel.'\"\nThomas Hardy referred to the incident in Far from the Madding Crowd:\n\n\"Cain, Cain, how can you!\" asked Joseph sternly. \"You be asked to swear in a holy manner, and you swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera, who cursed as he came. Young man, fie!\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It has a height of 40 m (130 ft) and a length of 114 m (374 ft).\nOriginally built in the 1930s, the Surkhab Dam is one of the largest sources of year-long water in Logar Province. It provides water for irrigation to around 2,000 ha (4,900 acres) of agriculture land. As of 2009, at least 3,500 farms in the province benefit from the dam.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan\nValleys of Afghanistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShah Mahmoud, Hanifi (March 2024). \"Water in Afghanistan: a modern history\".

        "content": "In 1624 the city of Fez in northern Morocco was devastated by a major earthquake between three and four in the morning of 11 May. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a maximum felt intensity of VIII–IX on the MSK scale. The earthquake caused severe damage in Fez and the surrounding area. It was felt as far away as Seville in southern Spain. Thousands of people died.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nFez lies within the southern part of the Rif, which forms part of the Gibraltar Arc. The Rif and the Betic Cordillera were formed during the Cenozoic, initially as a result of convergence between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The collisional structure was modified during the Miocene by a combination of westward migration of the mountain belt and extension that resulted in formation of the Alboran Sea The extension may be a result of back-arc basin formation related to subduction during the Miocene. Although it remains unclear whether there is still active subduction, the convergence continues at a rate of 4 mm per year in a NW–SE direction. The most external part of the Rif is formed of a series of thrust faults and related folds, referred to as the Prerif.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe magnitude of this event has been estimated from the distribution of seismic intensities, giving a mean value of 6.0 Mw . From a description of damage in contemporary reports, the seismic intensity associated with this earthquake is estimated to have been VIII–IX at Fez, VII–VIII at Meknès and Sefrou, VII at Beni Zeroual, VI–VII at Taza, VI at Beni Ouriaghel, P.V. Gomera and Salé, V at Melilla and IV at Safi.\nThe Saïss basin lies to the south of Fez. There is evidence from seismites found in the lacustrian and fluvial sediments deposited in this basin that the area has been affected by active tectonics since at least the Late Pliocene (3.6 million years ago). The Southern Rif Front, which borders the basin, is formed of a series of faults and related folds. The western part of this fault zone is a likely location for the rupture that caused the 1624 earthquake.\n\n\n== Damage ==\nFez suffered the most severe effects of the earthquake. Very few buildings were unaffected, with many collapsing. The damage was greatest in the older part of the city, Fes el Bali. This difference in damage is reflected in the reported number of casualties, with over 2,500 dead in Fes el Bali compared to only eleven in the newer district of Fes el-Jdid and none in the Mellah. At Meknès, two towers were destroyed and two fatalities were reported, while at Sefrou four houses were ruined but there were no deaths.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1755 Meknes earthquake - badly damaged Meknes and Fez\nList of earthquakes in Morocco\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alex London (who has also published under the names Charles London  and C. Alexander London) is an American author for children and young adults, and adults, having authored picture books, middle grade and young fiction, as well as adult nonfiction. He has worked as a journalist and human rights researcher reporting from conflict zones and refugee camps, a young adult librarian with New York Public Library, and a snorkel salesman.  He lives with his husband and daughter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAlex London was born in 1980 in Baltimore, Maryland and attended the Gilman School. He graduated in 2002 from Columbia University, where he studied philosophy. In 2010, he earned a master's degree in library and information science from Pratt Institute.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLondon has published in a variety of genres (fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, contemporary, and nonfiction), working with several of the Big Five publishing houses including Scholastic, Penguin Random House, Macmillan, and HarperCollins. His books have sold an estimated 2.5 million copies around the world and been translated into 7 languages, as well as being optioned for film and television.\nAt the inaugural BookCon in 2014, he conducted the opening keynote conversation with best-selling YA author Veronica Roth.\nLondon worked as a research associate for Refugees International while researching the book that would become One Day the Soldiers Came, and served as a Truman National Security Project Fellow in 2009. In 2015, he was appointed to the board of YALLFest, a young adult literature festival in Charleston, SC.\n\n\n== LGBTQ representation ==\nHis 2013 young adult novel, Proxy, was one of the only mainstream dystopian YA novels during the dystopian boom of the 2010s to feature a gay protagonist.\nIn a 2016 essay, he explored why it was important to him to be out as a gay author in the children's book space, and he has been noted for the inclusion of the LGBTQ+ characters and themes in his diverse array of stories.\nHis 2018 novel, Black Wings Beating, received starred reviews from Kirkus and School Library Journal, which recommended it for \"all libraries that serve teens\". The New York Times called it \"wondrous\" and it was an NBC Today Show Pick, which Isaac Fitzgerald called \"a YA fantasy unlike any you’ve read before\". It was a Rainbow List Selection, a Kirkus Best Young Adult Fantasy of 2018 selection, a Seventeen Magazine best of 2018 pick, a Paste Magazine best of 2018 pick, and We Need Diverse Books 2018 Must Read.\nIn 2022, he helped write an author letter against book banning that was read into the record by Congressman Jamie Raskin.\nIn 2023, YouTuber Hbomberguy revealed that London's Reactor essay about Stephen King's IT was among the pieces plagiarized in James Somerton's videos on LGBTQ representation in pop culture.\nIn 2023, there was an attempt to ban his middle grade fantasy Battle Dragons series in Kentucky because of the inclusion of a nonbinary character, but the ban was reversed.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Adult nonfiction ===\nOne Day The Soldiers Came: Voices of Children in War (2007) HarperPerennial\nFar From Zion: In Search of a Global Jewish Community (2009) William Morrow\n\n\n=== Young adult fiction ===\nProxy; Philomel/Penguin Young Readers Group\nProxy (2013);\nGuardian (2014)\nSkybound Saga Farrar, Straus, & Giroux-Macmillan Children's\nBlack Wings Beating (2018)\nRed Skies Falling (2019)\nGold Wings Rising (2020)\n\n\n=== Middle grade fiction ===\nThe Accidental Adventures, Philomel/Penguin Young Readers\nBook 1: We Are Not Eaten By Yaks (2011)\nBook 2: We Dine with Cannibals (2012)\nBook 3: We Give a Squid a Wedgie (2013)\nBook 4: We Sled With Dragons (2013)\nDog Tags Scholastic Books\nSemper Fido (2012)\nStrays (2012)\nPrisoners of War (2013)\nDivided We Fall (2013)\nTides of War Scholastic Books\nBlood in the Water (2014)\nHonor Bound (2014)\nEnemy Lines (2015)\nEndurance (2015)\nThe 39 Clues Scholastic Books\nMission Hindenburg (2015)\nOutbreak: Superspecial (2016)\nThe Wild Ones/Philomel Penguin Young Readers Group\nThe Wild Ones (2015)\nMoonlight Brigade (2016)\nGreat Escape (2017)\nBattle Dragons Scholastic Books\nCity of Thieves (2021)\nCity of Speed (2022)\nCity of Secrets (2023)\nSearch and Rescue:\nPentagon Escape (2023); Scholastic Books\nThe Princess Protection Program Greenwillow Books/HarperCollins\nThe Princess Protection Program (2023)\nAfter Ever After (2024)\n\n\n=== Picture books ===\nStill Life, illus.

        "content": "Bread fork sometimes called pastry fork or cake fork, is a specialized utensil used for serving bread. It typically has two or three elongated prongs and a handle, and it's designed to grasp and serve slices of bread without damaging them.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThey typically have several tines, usually two or three, which are longer and thinner than those of a regular fork. These elongated tines make it easier to pierce through bread without squashing or tearing it, allowing for clean and precise serving. The tines are usually spaced apart to allow for easy piercing and lifting of the bread. In formal dining settings, a bread fork might be part of a larger set of serving utensils, including items like butter knives and salad forks.\nBread forks are frequently crafted with intricate designs, particularly when they're included in a formal dining collection. Their handles might be adorned with detailed patterns and made from luxurious materials such as sterling silver, stainless steel, or delicate porcelain. Additionally, they can be part of a coordinated set of utensils intended for serving different dishes during formal dining occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hans Albrecht (22 November 1919 – 27 March 2008) was a German politician and high-ranking party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the SED in Bezirk Suhl and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED and the National Defence Council. In the Berlin Wall shooting trials, he was sentenced to five years and one month in prison for manslaughter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAlbrecht came from a working-class family in the Ruhr area. A few months after completing his training as a locksmith, he was drafted into the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht for the duration of World War II.\nAfter the war, Albrecht settled in Saxony, worked as a heating engineer, and joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party) in his hometown of Bennewitz. He became a member of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in 1946 following the forced merger of the SPD and KPD (Communist Party of Germany).\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nFrom 1946 he was a staff member, later until 1949 secretary of the district leadership of the new SED in Grimma.\n\n\n=== Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder) career ===\nIn 1950 he attended the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy. Subsequently, his stations from 1951 were Frankfurt (Oder), Eberswalde, and Stalinstadt, where he became First Secretary of the SED district leadership, and from 1954 also worked in the Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder) SED leadership. In the same year, he was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED. He held this status until January 1963 (VI. Party Congress), after which he became a full member.\nSince 1958 chairman of the Bezirk Economic Council and member of the Bezirk legislature, he became chairman of the Council of Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder) in 1960, formally making him head of government of the Bezirk. However, he was de facto subservient to the local SED leadership.\nFrom 1963 he completed a two-year study at the Industrial Institute of the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, which he completed a with a degree in industrial engineering (Dipl.-Ing. oec.). After completing his studies in Freiberg, he became the first deputy chairman of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection of the GDR, succeeding Günter Sieber, who became Minister for Trade and Supply.\n\n\n=== Bezirk Suhl SED First Secretary ===\n\nIn August 1968, he succeeded Otto Funke as First Secretary of the Bezirk Suhl SED leadership, a position he held for 21 years until 1989. Bezirk Suhl had the smallest population and was the most geographically isolated Bezirk of the GDR.\nHe additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1971 and a member of the presidium of the German-Arab Society of the GDR. In 1972, he was elected to the National Defense Council of the GDR, likely due to the long western border of Bezirk Suhl with West Germany.\nAlbrecht's leadership was viewed negatively. His leadership style was authoritarian, occasionally described as dictatorial, and he was viewed as a hardliner.\nIn 1988, he unsuccessfully tried to pressure Bad Salzungen SED First Secretary Hans-Dieter Fritschler to rescind his statements in the book Der Erste (English: The first one). The book provided an unfalsified account of Fritschler's work as a local SED functionary and detailed the GDR's problems, including dysfunction stemming from the Bezirk Suhl SED leadership.\nAlbrecht was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in Gold in 1974, and the Karl Marx Order in 1979.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nDuring the Wende, on 2 November 1989, the Bezirk Suhl SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed reformer Peter Pechauf as his successor. He was removed by his party from the Volkskammer two weeks later, on 16 November 1989.\nAt its last session on 3 December 1989, the Central Committee expelled Albrecht from the Central Committee and from the SED shortly before its collective resignation.\n\n\n=== Reunified Germany ===\nAlbrecht passed away in 2008 at the age of 88.\n\n\n== Prosecution after the Wende ==\n\n\n=== Conviction for abuse of office and embezzlement ===\nAfter the Wende, Albrecht was arrested for abuse of power and embezzlement. In October 1992, he was sentenced by the Meiningen Regional Court to 22 months in prison for incitement to embezzlement. He did not have to serve the sentence because he had already served more than half of the time in pre-trial detention.\n\n\n=== Conviction for manslaughter ===\nAfter the German reunification, he was indicted in May 1991 as part of the Berlin Wall shooting trials with another arrest warrant. As part of the trials against former members of the National Defense Council of the GDR, he was charged with \"complicity in manslaughter\" (political responsibility for the fatal shootings at the Berlin Wall) before the Berlin Regional Court.\nOn 16 September 1993, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for incitement to manslaughter. The verdict was changed in the appeal by the Federal Court of Justice on 26 July 1994, to manslaughter as an indirect perpetrator and the sentence was increased to five years and one month. Since Albrecht's defense raised constitutional complaints, he initially remained free.\nOn 12 November 1996, the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaints of Albrecht and others. The killing of refugees was the most serious injustice that precluded the justification of those responsible by GDR laws. Albrecht served his sentence in a Berlin prison.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Bansanka\" (晩餐歌, lit. 'The Supper Song') is the debut single by Japanese singer-songwriter Tuki. It was released independently by her label the Lunar Landing Plan on September 29, 2023. In January 2024, the song topped both the Oricon Combined Singles Chart and Billboard Japan Hot 100.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nTuki began posting her cover and original songs on TikTok while in middle school. \"Bansanka\" was first uploaded onto TikTok on July 7, 2023. The acoustic version of the song was uploaded to YouTube on September 13, and the duet version with singer-songwriter Yuuri on November 6.\n\"Bansanka\" was inspired after her father mentioned \"There are about 30,000 days in a lifetime\". Reflecting on that, she thought \"I've already lived 5,000 days and only have about 25,000 more\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Hot 100 number-one singles of 2024 (Japan)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sinapovska reka (Bulgarian: Синаповска река) is a river in southern Bulgaria, a right tributary of the river Tundzha of the Maritsa drainage, with a length of 50 km.\nThe river takes its source under the name Golyamata reka at an altitude of 574 m in the small Sakar mountain range, some 3 km north of its highest summit Vishegrad (856 m). It initially flows in direction northwest and then northeast in a narrow valley. At the village of Dobroselets the river changes direction first to the east and then to the southeast, flowing between the northern slopes of Sakar in the south and the southern slopes of the Manastirski Heights to the north. In this section its valley significantly widens and has an asymmetrical profile with steeper right (southern) slopes. After the village of Sinapovo, it enters the southwestern part of the Elhovo Field. The Sinapovska reka flows into the Tundzha at an altitude of 96 m one kilometer northeast of the village of Knyazhevo.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 871 km2 or 10.33% of the Tundzha's total. Its largest tributary the Kalnitsa (72 km) is longer than the Sinapovska reka itself.\nThe Sinapovska reka has predominantly rain feed with high water in autumn and winter. The average annual flow is at Sinapovo is 1.3 m3/s. \nThe river flows entirely in Haskovo Province. There are three settlements along its course, the villages of Dobroselets, Chukarovo and Sinapovo in Topolovgrad Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Obaid Mohammed Abdullah Zaid Obaid Al-Mutairi (Arabic: عبيد محمد عبد الله زيد عبيد المطيري; born January 5, 1971), also known as Obaid Al-Wasmi, is a Kuwaiti academic, politician and member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly. He is also a doctor and lecturer in procedural law at the College of Law of Kuwait University. Al-Mutairi was a member of the annulled February 2012 National Assembly. In a by-election held on May 22, 2021, for the Fifth Constituency, Al-Mutairi achieved first place with 43,810 votes, marking the highest number ever recorded in Kuwaiti parliamentary election history.\n\n\n== Education ==\nObaid Al-Wasmi graduated from Kuwait University in 1994 and pursued his postgraduate studies in the United Kingdom, where he earned a master's degree. He later received a Ph.D. in litigation law with distinction from the American University in Washington.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nObaid Al-Wasmi ran in the February 2012 Kuwaiti National Assembly elections representing the fourth district, securing the third position with 22,068 votes. Although successful, the assembly was later nullified by a ruling from the Kuwaiti Constitutional Court. Al-Wasmi is regarded as a leading opposition figure in Kuwaiti politics, advocating for a constitutional emirate and a parliamentary government. He is also a litigation lawyer in the Gulf. He defended Qatari poet Mohammad bin Al-Dheeb, a prisoner of conscience.\nOn September 23, 2020, Al-Wasmi, along with Abdullah Al-Nafisi, introduced a document called \"The Kuwait Document\" as an initial step to address the current political and economic situation, presenting it to then Deputy Emir Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.\nOn April 23, 2021, Al-Wasmi announced his candidacy for a by-election to fill the vacant seat of Badr Al-Dahoum through a tweet: \"I declare my candidacy for the by-election (for the seat of) brother Dr. Badr Zayed Al-Dahoum until his return, God willing, as a guest of the fifth constituency and its people. We ask God for success and ask for your support and acceptance in this (constitutional referendum).\" His candidacy was met with parliamentary and public support, and several candidates withdrew from the race in his favor. The by-election, held on May 22, 2021, resulted in Al-Wasmi achieving first place with 43,810 votes, setting a record for the highest number in Kuwait's political history, while his closest competitor, Ajmi Al-Matlaq, secured second place with 1,331 votes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Segunda Federación play-offs (Playoffs de Ascenso or Promoción de Ascenso) are the final play-offs for promotion from 2023–24 Segunda Federación to the 2024–25 Primera Federación. \n\n\n== Format ==\nTwenty teams participated in the promotion play-off. Each of the five groups of the Segunda División RFEF are represented by the four teams that finished the regular season between the second and fifth positions. In the draw for the first stage, the participating teams were assigned to pots corresponding to their final regular season position. While avoiding matches between teams from the same regular season group, second-place finishers were drawn against fifth-place finishers while teams that finished third would play teams that finished fourth. The same draw process was repeated, to the extent that it would be possible, in the draw for the second round.\nThe five winning clubs of the second stage attained promotion to Primera RFEF and accompanied the five group champions who had already achieved their promotion.\nThe final two relegation spots (of 27 total) were also determined via play-offs. The four 13th-place finishers with the lowest point totals were drawn into two single-leg matches, with the winners securing survival in the Segunda División RFEF and the losers being relegated to the Tercera División RFEF. The two match-ups were selected through a random draw and hosted at a venue chosen from among the stadiums selected to host the promotion play-offs.\n\n\n== Promotion play-offs ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n==== Participating teams ====\nAtlético Paso\nBadalona Futur\nBarakaldo\nBetis Deportivo\nDeportivo Aragón\nEuropa\nGetafe B\nGuijuelo\nLleida Esportiu\nUD Logroñés\nMarbella\nNumancia\nOrihuela\nPontevedra\nRayo Cantabria\nSan Sebastián de los Reyes\nSant Andreu\nUtebo\nYeclano\nZamora\n\n\n==== Road to the play-offs ====\n\n\n===== Group 1 =====\n\n\n===== Group 2 =====\n\n\n===== Group 3 =====\n\n\n===== Group 4 =====\n\n\n===== Group 5 =====\n\n\n=== First round ===\n\n\n==== Qualified teams ====\n\n\n==== Matches ====\n\nBold indicates teams that advanced to the second round \n\nFirst leg\n\nSecond leg\n\n\n== Promoted teams ==\nThe five teams that were or would be promoted to Primera Federación through regular season groups and the five play-off winners were included.\nThe number of years after the last participation of the club in the third tier is referred to the previous appearance at that level, where Segunda División B was replaced by the Primera Federación.\n\n\n== Relegation play-offs ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n==== Participating teams ====\nFormentera\nIzarra\nManchego\nReal Avilés\n\n\n==== Road to the play-offs ====\n\n\n==== Qualified teams ====",

This is Lucero's third album in the regional Mexican genre in the Sinaloan band category, and also the third produced by Luciano Luna. The songs in this album consist of six original tracks and others are covers of hits previously performed by other artists.With this album, along with the success of her previous albums, Lucero demonstrates her interest in continuing within the Sinaloan band genre.\nThe album was released in a standard version with 10 tracks, as well as in CD+DVD format with 19 tracks, and finally in a special edition containing 26 tracks, including collaborations with other artists such as Luciano Pereyra, Gerardo Ortíz, Luis Fonsi, and Carlos Rivera, some of which were promoted as singles for the album.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the success of her two previous Sinaloan band albums, Enamorada con banda and Más enamorada con banda, Lucero, in collaboration with producer and composer Luciano Luna, decided to release a third album in the genre. Following the release of her fourth live album, Enamorada en vivo, and in celebration of her 39-year career, Lucero remained on tour with performances in Mexico and other Latin American countries such as the United States, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. During her tour in Brazil, Lucero promoted her fifth live album, Brasileira en vivo.\nIn February 2019, Lucero, along with Banda Los Recoditos, announced that they were recording the song \"Solo me faltabas tú,\" which would be the first single from Lucero's upcoming musical production. On July 31, after her successful concert at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, Lucero, through her Twitter account, asked her fans to help name her next musical production. She gave the option of two possible names, \"Solo me faltabas tú\" and \"Siempre enamorada,\" with the former being the selected name.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nThe album's first single, \"Me deshice de tu amor,\" was released on May 3, 2019, accompanied by its \"Sierreña version,\" and was well received by the public. The album's second single, \"A través del vaso,\" a duet with Banda Los Sebastianes, was released on August 18, 2019, and also had a positive reception. The third single, \"Siempre te necesito,\" a duet with Gerardo Ortíz, was released on October 11, 2019, and was well received by the public. The fourth and last single, \"Solo me faltabas tú,\" a duet with Banda Los Recoditos, was released on November 1, 2019, the same day as the album, and became one of the most popular songs on the album.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Me deshice de tu amor\" / \"Me deshice de tu amor (Sierreña version)\" (May 3, 2019 / August 14, 2019)\n\"A través del vaso\" (with Banda Los Sebastianes) (August 18, 2019)\n\"Siempre te necesito\" (with Gerardo Ortíz) (October 11, 2019)\n\"Solo me faltabas tú\" (with Banda Los Recoditos) (November 1, 2019)\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

On January 30, 2023, NJPW announced that all of the promotion's future American events would be branded under the \"Strong\" name. NJoA PPVs have since aired under the NJPW Strong Live banner; these PPV events will later air as part of the NJPW Strong on Demand series.\nOn May 5, 2024, NJPW announced that a third Resurgence event will take place on May 11, 2024, at the Toyota Arena in Ontario, California.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event will feature several professional wrestling matches, which involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was written in response to a competition being held by Theo Hamilton, who offered a £250 prize for a \"colonial play\". (This money was reportedly never paid out.)\nThe play was put on at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne following a production of Ostracised. Many of the same cast appeared in both plays.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Argus said \"The story is of a highly romantic character, and the incidents are not more improbable than is customary in play a of the school to which this belongs.\"\nThe Australasian said \"the materials of this play are thoroughly Australian, and as the author is Australian too, and is not unfavourably known in the other colony, its success will testify to the existence of literary ability in this part of the world. \"\nThe Age said \"The stage has not hitherto been much enriched by the productions of Australian dramatists, and Mr. Burnage's play is certainly no exception to the rule. The materials he uses are bushranging exploits and convict life, but surely enough has been already written on the lawlessness of early colonial times to make Mr. Burnage's work quite superfluous. The subject is neither healthy nor attractive in style, and it scarcely redounds to our credit that plays founded on convict life and bushranging should gain recognition as specimens of Australian dramatic literature.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\nIn the early days of colonial New South Wales, a man is wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Buckle Up South Carolina 200 was the 9th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and the 5th iteration of the event. The majority of the race was held on Friday, May 10, 2024, and would end shortly after midnight on Saturday, May 11, due to constant rain showers that delayed the start. The race was held in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198 km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 147 laps, but was increased to 150 laps due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a wild and action packed race, Ross Chastain, driving for Niece Motorsports, would steal the win after taking the lead on the final restart, and held off a fast charging field to earn his fifth career NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series win, and his first of the season. Corey Heim, who started second, was the most dominant driver of the race, winning both stages and leading a race-high 77 laps, but finished 28th after being involved in a late race incident. To fill out the podium, Nick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, and Ben Rhodes, driving for ThorSport Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.\n\nSince 2015, the race has hosted NASCAR's Throwback weekend, which features cars sporting paint schemes that pay homage to past teams and drivers.  (The lineage of this race includes races billed as the Southern 500 from 2005 to 2020.)\n\n\n=== Entry list ===\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice was held on Friday, May 10, at 3:05 PM EST, and would last for 20 minutes. Christian Eckes, driving for McAnally-Hilgemann Racing, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 29.540, and a speed of 166.473 mph (267.912 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Friday, May 10, at 3:35 PM EST. Since Darlington Raceway is an intermediate speedway, the qualifying system used is a single-car, single-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have one lap to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nNick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 29.288, and a speed of 167.905 mph (270.217 km/h).\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 45\n\nStage 2 Laps: 45\n\nStage 3 Laps: 60\n\n\n== Standing after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Union Church, once located in Wiscasset, Maine, was determined to be the world's smallest church according to the Guinness Book of World Records from 1958 until 1990.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Union Church was constructed in 1958 by Reverend Louis W. West, a retired Baptist pastor from Boston, Massachusetts. The church could hold three occupants: a pastor and two parishioners. It is said that West performed ten marriages and one baptism in the church. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the church's floor area measured 31 square feet (7 ft x 4.5 ft). Sources say that the steeple had a golf ball placed atop it and that the church itself was never locked.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe Union Church lost its title in July 1990 to Cross Island Chapel on Mason's Pond in Oneida, New York.\nFollowing West's death in 1966, the church was maintained as a memorial to his work. Over the years, Union Church deteriorated, was vandalized and eventually demolished. In April 2024, the Wiscasset Speedway erected an exact replica of the Union Church and dedicated it to Edna Verney, who (according to her granddaughter) was \"fascinated by the church’s history and would visit it often with her children and friends.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBuffalo News Worlds Smallest Chapel is Dedicated on Tiny Island.\nWiscasset, Maine.",

        "content": "Internment camps in Ethiopia during the prime ministership of Abiy Ahmed during the 2020s include camps holding Tigrayans during the Tigray War, Eritreans, and Amharas during the War in Amhara.\n\n\n== Tigrayans ==\n\nInternment camps to hold Tigrayans were run during the Tigray War, starting in November 2020, when 700 ethnic Tigrayans were detained in Addis Ababa. The number dropped to around 300 in December 2020. Authorities cited the reason for detention as being suspicion of links to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). An Abbadi warehouse detention site in Mai Kadra held 3000 to 8000 detainees, including 400 chlidren and people aged in their 70s and 80s, during November 2020, with no provision of food or water by the camp guards; Doctors Without Borders had access to the camp and provided food and water.\nIn April 2021, 500 ethnic Tigrayans were held under arbitrary arrest based on their ethnic identity in an Addis Ababa detention centre. Conditions were described as \"miserable\" by a health worker, with around 30 detainees per room. None of the detainees had been brought before a judge as of May 2021. A wave of arrests of ethnic Tigrayans and of journalists took place in July 2021. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) stated that it was monitoring the detentions.\nIn September, Amhara Region forces detained \"thousands\" of ethnic Tigrayan men, women and children, residents of Humera, in detention centres that witnesses described to the The Daily Telegraph as concentration camps, in which eyes were removed from one victim, victims' limbs were cut off and bodies were thrown into mass graves. According to a participant of a public meeting in Humera, the Amhara forces stated, \"We should exterminate all Tigrayan residents in the city. We must cleanse them all.\" An administrative list indicating residents's identification as Tigrayan from their identity cards was used to find Tigrayans in house-to-house operations. Salon.com, based on witness reports by former detainees and doctors, satellite imagery and video recordings, stated that children among the detainees were starved and abused.\nIn November 2021, a wave of ethnicity-based arrests of Tigrayans including \"dozens of priests, monks, deacons and others\" took place. The New York Times described these as having \"swept up anyone of Tigrayan descent, many of whom had no ties to the rebels or even affinity for them,\" including \"mothers with children and the elderly\". Laetitia Bader of HRW described the state of emergency, which formally permitted the mass detentions, as \"'legitimizing and legalizing unlawful practices' and creating a 'real climate of fear'.\" On 20 November, Genocide Watch classified the Ethiopian situation as including stage 8 of genocide, persecution.\n\n\n=== Mirab Abaya massacre ===\nBased on its investigation including \"26 interviews with prisoners, medical personnel, officials, local residents and relatives, and on a review of satellite imagery, social media posts and medical records\", The Washington Post found that on one day in November 2021, 83 Tigrayan prisoners were executed in the Mirab Abaya detention camp, which held from 2000 to 2500 Tigrayan soldiers and former soldiers, by about 18 of the camp guards. The victims' bodies were piled in a mass gave near the camp entrance. The massacre stopped when Girma Ayele, a colonel, arrived. Girma stated that the guards suspected of the killings were arrested.\nOfficials in Mirab Abaya made announcements on loudspeakers requesting locals to kill any escapees. Among a group of prisoners who escaped from the camp during the massacre, most were lynched by a group of local residents.\nThe EHRC stated that it was investigating the massacre.\n\n\n=== Abuses and killings ===\nTorture and beatings were systematic at the camps. In the Abbadi camp in November 2020, guards stated in response to a request for the purchase of insulin for a detainee with diabetes, \"We are not here to treat you; we are here to kill you. We are gathering the Tigrayan refugees here to kill them.\"\n\n\n=== Numbers ===\nIn November 2021, Salsay Weyane Tigray estimated 20,000 to 30,000 detentions of Tigrayans outside of war zones. African Citizens estimated the number of Tigrayans held \"just for the crime of who they are or where they come from\" to be 40,000 on 26 November 2021. On the same day, Clark, Lapsley & Alton estimated 30,000 Tigrayan civilians detained in Addis Ababa, 15,000 Tigrayan military detained since late 2020, and unknown numbers of Tigrayans held in western Tigray and elsewhere in Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Eritreans ==\nIn July 2022, Eritrean refugees were held in detention camps near Debarq in Amhara Region and near Alemwach.\n\n\n== Amharas ==\nDuring the War in Amhara, Amharas were held in detention centres that were overcrowded and had insufficient access to medical care, leading to two hundred deaths in September 2023 due to a cholera outbreak.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe 2020s camps holding Tigrayans were described as concentration camps by Jonathan Hutson, writing in Salon.com, who argued that the term was justified on the basis of thousands of adults and hundreds of children being \"held in harsh conditions, systematically starved and beaten because of their ethnicity and with no judicial process or valid legal pretext\" by Ethiopian security forces.\nIn November 2021, on online social media, journalists, politicians and pro-government activists called for Tigrayans to be held in what they referred to as concentration camps. Online footage of the detention centres for Amharas in September 2023 described them as concentration camps.\nThe Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention stated that the 2023 camps holding Amharas were concentration camps.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nLocations of the internment centres include the Awash Arba and Awash Sebat detention centres in Afar Region; a detention centre near Gelan Condominiums in Addis Ababa; an Abbadi warehouse compound in Mai Kadra; a camp at Mirab Abaya; and a camp holding Amharas in September 2023 in Tulu Dimtu according to the Amhara Association of America.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shenzhen Inovance Technology (also known as Inovance; Chinese: 汇川技术; pinyin: Huìchuān Jìshù) is a publicly listed Chinese company that engages in the manufacture and sale of electrical equipment that includes industrial automation control products and robotics.\nIt is currently the largest industrial automation company in China as well as its second largest domestic producer of industrial robots.  Founded by a group of former Huawei engineers,  the company has been dubbed \"Little Huawei\" in the industry.\n\n\n== Background ==\nInovance was founded in April 2003 by Zhu Xingming and several other engineers from Huawei. When the company was founded, it aimed to compete in the high-end market with foreign companies and never to fall into a price war with domestic companies.\nOn 28 September 2010, Inovance held its initial public offering and became a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Afterwards it expanded its product range from single frequency changers to other  industrial control products such as programmable logic controllers and servomechanisms.\nOriginally servicing the lower end market, the company gradually moved to take market share in the higher end market from European and Japanese incumbents.\nAccording to a report by Deutsche Bank in 2017, Inovance stood to benefit heavily from the Made in China 2025 policy that would increased domestic industrial automation demand. At the time foreign companies still controlled 65% of China's industrial automation market.\nIn June 2021, Inovance announced it had secured a CNY2.1 billion private placement from twelve investors that included Hillhouse Investment, CITIC Securities, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, UBS and AIA Group. The company plamed to use the proceeds from it to  acquire the remaining 49 percent stake in subsidiary Inovance Control Technology as well as expanding its output of automation control equipment, and developing smart software. Its stock price rose 7.9% after the announcement.\nIn January 2024, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology announced it teamed up with Inovance to launch a program to train senior engineers and a technology research institute for robotics.\nIn April 2024, Zhu stated the company hopes it would be able to challenge larger incumbents such as ABB and Siemens for a place in the top three largest companies in the sector globally within five years. He also stated he believe Chinese automation companies will keep global supply chains running and insulate them from protectionism as they try to expand overseas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is the largest tributary of the Arapliyska reka.\nThe river takes its source under the name Chakarlia an altitude of 502 m in the Dervent Heights, some 7005 m south of their highest point Gyurgenbair (555 m), which is situated in Bulgarian territory just north of the Bulgaria–Turkey border. It flows in a narrow forested valley through the northern slopes of the Dervent Heights in direction northwest. It flows into the Arapliyska at an altitude of 117 m some 200 m east of the village of Chernozem.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 159 km2 or 45.3% of the Popovska reka's total. The Boyalashka reka has predominantly rain feed with high water in autumn and winter.\nThe river flows entirely in Yambol Province. There is only one settlement along its course, the village of Lalkovo in Elhovo Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "f Geminorum (74 Geminorum) is a K-type giant star in the constellation Gemini. It is located about 532 light-years from Earth based on a Hipparcos parallax. The star is often subject to lunar occultations, allowing an accurate measurement of its angular diameter. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.05, making it faintly visible to the naked eye. \n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nBased on its spectral type of K5.5III, it is a star that has left the main sequence and evolved into a K-type giant star. It irradiates about 670 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,933 K. The angular diameter, as measured by a lunar occultation, is 3.12±0.06 milliarcseconds. At the current distance of 163.1 pc (532 light-years), as measured by a Hipparcos parallax of 6.13 milliarcseconds, it gives a physical size of 89.6 R☉. \nf Geminorum has an apparent magnitude of 5.05m, making it visible to the naked eye only from locations with dark skies, far from light pollution. The absolute magnitude, i.e. the magnitude of the star if it was seen at 10 parsecs (33 ly), is -1.01. It is located in the coordinates RA 07h 39m 28.59s, DEC +17° 40′ 28.3″, which is within the Gemini constellation. The star is moving away from Earth a velocity of 25.38 km/s. f Geminorum is the star's Bayer designation. Other designations for the star include 74 Geminorum (the Flamsteed designation), HIP 37300 (from the Hipparcos catalogue), HR 2938 (from the Bright Star Catalogue) and HD 61338 (from the Henry Draper Catalogue). \nThe star is often subject to lunar occultations. One of these occultations were observed by the SAO RAS 6-m telescope, which allowed the angular diameter of 74 Geminorum to be accurately measured at 3.12±0.06 milliarcseconds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of stars in Gemini\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lea Vélez (Madrid, May 16, 1970) is a Spanish author, screenwriter and journalist.\nShe was born into a family with a broad literary tradition. Daughter of the intellectual Carlos Vélez (1930–2014), she studied journalism at the Complutense University of Madrid and graduated in Film Screenwriting at ECAM (Madrid cinema school). Her television career began in 1998, writing storyline and scripts for the series El súper. She has been a fiction content creator and show runner, co-creating series such as La Verdad de Laura or Luna Negra. She has created more than 700 hours of TV fiction.\nFor many years she collaborated closely with the screenwriter and author Susana Prieto. Writing as a team they published two novels, El desván (2004) and La Esfera de Ababol (2006). Later she takes on the stage with the play Tiza (2008), also in collaboration with Prieto, a satire on education that received the Agustín González Theater Prize and remained on the Madrid billboard for three seasons.\nAfter the death of her husband in 2011, she changed the direction of her career, leaving television aside to dedicate herself entirely to literature and the education of her small children. For them, and in an effort to overcome grief, she built a tree house in the large oak tree in the garden without anybody's help. The reflections she reached were used in her novel Nuestra casa en el árbol (Our Tree House), in which she narrates the adventures of a widow with three children in a large house by the River Hamble after losing her husband. A year before this book she wrote La cirujana de Palma and El Jardín de la memoria (2014).\nOur tree house was published in 2017 and became a long seller, a book recommended and loved by readers over the years. It is of particular interest to the gifted children parent's community.  The same year she published La Olivetti, la espía y el loro, a book in which she narrates the back stage of the TV program Encuentros con las letras, directed by her father and for which her mother, María Luisa Martín, ran the press office from the kitchen of her house while small Lea played under the table.\nOther recent books are La sonrisa de los pájaros (2019) or Mi querido extraterrestre (2020). In 2024 she published La hija de Gardel, a political thriller in the context of the trials of the Argentine military in Spain and the underworld of state terrorism.\nShe currently lives in Brighton (East Sussex, England), with her two children.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nLa hija de Gardel.

        "content": "The Capitolium of Constantinople (Latin: Capitolium Constantinopolis; Greek: Καπετώλιον της Κωνσταντινουπόλης) was a public edifice erected in Constantinople (today's Istanbul) by Emperor Constantine the Great. Born as a Capitolium (a temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad), in the fifth century it was turned into an institute of higher education.\n\n\n== Location ==\nOriginally the Capitolium was thought to be located at the top of the third hill of Constantinople, which is now occupied by the University of Istanbul. However, this position is refuted by De Ceremoniis, a 10th-century Byzantine ceremonial book, which mentions it as a landmark along the Emperor's triumphal procession. The procession started at the Golden Gate, and moved along the southern branch of the mese odos reaching in succession the Forum of the Ox (placed at today's Aksaray), the Capitolium and the Philadelphion (placed at today's Şehzadebaşı semt). The temple's position should then be between the Forum of the Ox and the Philadelphion, northwest of the Forum of Theodosius. To reach it, one had to climb the southern slopes of the third hill, akin to the ascent to Rome's Capitol to go to the Jupiter's Temple. Administratively it belonged to the eighth regio of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Capitolium  was erected in Constantinople by Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337). The building, together with the circus, the Great Palace, the Strategion and the forum, was one of those edifices needed to introduce the city as the new Rome. The edifice was originally a capitolium, that is a pagan temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad, but in the early fifth century a cross had already been put on its roof, although a conversion to church is not attested. Near the temple were built houses for the rich. At the latest in 425 AD the Capitolium was turned into an academy of higher education, the Pandidakterion, hosting public lessons at the southern exedrae. The sole purpose of the school was to educate civil servants for the administration of the state. There is no evidence that the Pandidakterion continued to work after the end of the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641) .\n\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to a law promulgated on 27 February 425 AD by Emperor Theodosius II (r. 402–450)  and contained in the Codex Theodosianus, it is known that the Capitolium was a rectangular edifice whose southern side had \"large and magnificent\" exedrae which bordered the porticoed side of a public road. This road could possibly be the mese odos, and the building overlooked the road near the junction whence one of its branches led to the Golden Gate. The Capitolium had also exedrae along its eastern and western sides, but these did not border any road, and until 425 were occupied by popinae (\"wine bars\" in the Roman world). The edifice was gilded, and its roof was covered with gilded bronze tiles, like the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in Rome, and topped by a cross (fallen because of a storm in 407 AD).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===\nIMPERATORIS THEODOSII CODEX (in Latin).

        "content": "The Arapliyska reka (Bulgarian: Араплийска река) is a river in southern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the river Popovska reka, itself a left tributary of the Tundzha of the Maritsa drainage, with a length of 42 km. It is the largest tributary of the Popovska reka.\nThe river takes its source under the name Golyama Derbventska reka at an altitude of 484 m in the Dervent Heights, about half a kilometer southwest of the peak of Charakbaba (540 m) on the Bulgaria–Turkey border. It flows in a narrow forested valley initially in western direction until the village of Valcha Polyana, it then turns north until Razdel and finally northwest until Chernozem, where it is joined by the Boyalashka reka. Downstream of Chernozem its valley widens and river makes meanders. It flows into the Popovska at an altitude of 98 m just 350 m east of the latter's confluence with the Tundzha, and is sometimes erroneously considered a tributary of the Tundzha.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 351 km2 or 65.9% of the Popovska reka's total. The largest tributary is the Boyalashka reka (33 km). The Arapliyska reka has predominantly rain feed with high water in autumn and winter.\nThe river flows entirely in Yambol Province. There are five settlements along its course, one town and four villages: Golyam Dervent, Valcha Polyana, Razdel and Chernozem in Elhovo Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Jesús Salmerón Berga (born 1 December 1991) is a Spanish politician. He was a member of the Corts Valencianes from 2019 to 2023. He left the Citizens party in 2021 and the following year joined the People's Party (PP), being elected mayor of Gátova in 2023.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSalmerón was born in Tavernes Blanques, Province of Valencia. He graduated with a law degree from the University of Valencia, and a master's degree in the penal system from the University of Lleida. From the age of 23, he has been a lawyer in the Ilustre Colegio de Abogados de Valencia (ICAV).\nSalmerón worked as an assistant for Citizens party in the Corts Valencianes. Openly gay, he worked on LGBT-related policy for the party in the Valencian Community. He ran as a candidate for the Senate of Spain in the 2016 general election.\nSalmerón became the national coordinator for Citizens' youth division in 2017. He was placed fifth in the party's list in the Valencia constituency; the top seven were elected.\nIn May 2021, Salmerón was one of four Citizens deputies to leave the party in protest at its fall from 26 deputies to zero in the Assembly of Madrid following an electoral wipeout. In October 2022, he became the People's Party (PP) candidate for mayor of Gátova, where he had lived since 2015. He won three of seven seats on the council and formed government with the support of the one member from the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country (PSPV), ending eight years of governance by the Citizens splinter Contigo Somos Democracia; he was the town's first PP mayor. He was also the first mayor in the municipality to take a salary, €31,800. Though Gátova had only 400 inhabitants and a budget of €500,000, his salary was still 75% of the maximum permitted by the law for a municipality of under 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== References ==",

The series originally aired as a limited series lasting six episodes between May 3 to May 10, 2024, as part of the Netflix is a Joke Festival. The show is hosted by comedian John Mulaney who also serves as the creator and executive producer. Richard Kind serves as the show's announcer. The series features monologues, guests, pre-taped sketches, and musical segments with field pieces shot around Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nHosted by comedian John Mulaney, each episode will have a theme, a monologue, pre-taped sketches, guest stars, and musical performers and will air live on Netflix at 10pm EDT. There will be six episodes Sunday through Friday from May 5 to 10, 2024, as part of the Netflix is a Joke Festival. The first guest of the talk show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, stated, \"This is the weirdest show I have ever been on in my life\" and later added \"You’ve brought your amazing rehab zaniness to this show\". Variety noted its influences, writing, \"With its wood paneling, warm earth tones, and ample houseplants, the studio for Everybody’s in LA is a ‘70s-inspired nod to the likes of Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett. Character actor Richard Kind, himself a visiting dignitary from New York, assumes the traditional role of the sidekick\".\n\n\n== Participants ==\nNumerous guests and musical performer appeared on the show including:\n\n\n=== Guests ===\n\n\n=== Pre-taped cameos ===\n\n\n=== Musical performers ===\n\n\n=== Guest callers ===\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe series received positive reviews with Matthew Creith of TheWrap declaring, \"[Mulaney] reinvents the late night format\" adding \"He’s that good and the eccentric show he’s built is delightfully nonsensical.\" EJ Dickinson of Rolling Stone wrote, \"There’s no real reason for Everybody’s in L.A., a six-episode live special, to exist but, like its host, it is unpredictable and charming\". Alison Herman of Variety described the series as a \"pop-up talk show\", adding \"with Everybody’s in LA Mulaney is back on more comfortable ground: a throwback vehicle for exploring highly personal hobby horses, casting himself as a self-effacing but still smoothly composed master of ceremonies\".\nMichael Martin of The A.V. Club however gave the series a negative review writing, \"Random chaos doesn’t make for consistent comedy, and episode one of Everybody’s In LA managed to come off both manic and sluggish\" before adding, \"The host would be well-advised to settle down, sharpen his comic focus, and take fewer prisoners, himself included\".\n\n\n== References ==",

The bark is yellowish-grey and smooth, and the twigs are stout, and are yellowish-green in color. The lenticles are ochre-colored, and the leaf scars are large and heart-shaped. Leaves are spirally arranged pinnately compound leaves up to 45 cm cm long, and are clustered at the end with 6-10 pair of opposite leaves. The petiole connecting the leaves are 4-11 centimeters long and are puberulous. The leaflets are entire, and are narrow ovate by 5–11 by 1.5-3.5 cm. They are mostly smooth above and are more pubescent beneath. The leaflets are apex acuminate with an obtuse tip, and the lateral nerves are 6-18 pairs. The midrib and lateral nerves are prominent on the underface and are pubescent, and usually have black, round elliptical glands especially on the nerves.\nThe inflorescences axillary panicles can be up to 19 centimeters long, and can be puberulous to pubescent. The bisexual flowers are up to 1-3 millimeters and the pedicles are densely hairy. The fruit is a samara, which are narrowly elliptic and can be 7–10 by 1.7-2.4 centimeters away from the flower on a slender stalk. Thin wings surround each single flat seed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Red to Blue is an album by the American musician Leon Redbone, released in 1986. It was his first album for August Records, a label started by Redbone. Redbone supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Beryl Handler and Redbone. David Bromberg accompanied Redbone on the cover of the Bob Dylan song \"Living the Blues\". Hank Williams Jr. provided a spoken part for the cover of his father's version of \"Lovesick Blues\". Biréli Lagrène played guitar on \"Whose Honey Are You?\" The Roches contributed backing vocals; Dr. John played piano. The album title comes from a Jelly Roll Morton quote that describes the transition from Spanish musical styles to blues-based ones.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe New York Times wrote that \"Leon Redbone carries to a peak his mixture of jazz-filtered old pop songs, blues and 'contemp-folk' with the assistance of a pool of traditional jazz and folk-jazz musicians who light momentarily like hummingbirds in these performances, then take off again.\" The Columbia Daily Tribune said that the album \"saunters and shuffles like an old hepcat, past his prime but still jiving along at his own unhurried pace.\"\nThe Vancouver Sun determined that \"Redbone's almost hallucinogenic, sweeping you up in the gentle swing of his music and transporting you back to a '30s dance hall.\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution deemed the album \"his standard fare—barely intelligible vocals that get so loooow, clarinets, coronets, guitars, banjoes and tuba.\" Likewise, the Detroit Free Press considered it \"the same old hambone.\"\nAllMusic praised \"the usual Dixieland backing augmenting his tasteful fingerpicked guitar work.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Point 4875 took place from 4 to 7 July 1999 and was a pivotal military offensive carried out by the 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles battalion in the Kargil War of 1999. The battle was an Indian success.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 13 JAK Rifles was placed under the command of the 79 Mountain Brigade after their victory at point 5140. The next assignment for Lt Col YK Joshi's battalion was to capture Point 4875, a strategically important peak located in the Mushkoh Valley. Since the feature dominated the National Highway 1 completely from Dras to Matayan, it became imperative for the Indian Army to capture Point 4875. A stretch of 30–40 kilometres of the national highway was under direct observation of the infiltrators. From Point 4875, Pakistani artillery observers could easily see Indian gun positions, army camps and troop movement, and bring down effective artillery fire at will.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOn 1 July 1999, Major S Vijay Bhaskar, 'A' Company commander, and Lt. Col. Joshi, commanding officer of the 13 JAK Rifles, conducted their preliminary reconnaissance, after climbing to a vantage point, and formulated an attack plan. Subsequently, on 2 July, GOC-8 Mountain Division, Maj Gen Mohinder Puri and Brig Rajesh Kumar Kakkar Commander 79 Mountain Brigade and Lt Col Y.K. Joshi, Commanding Officer 13th JAK Rifles gathered at 79 Mountain Brigades headquarters, to discuss the plan.\nThe battalion was deployed to firebase, located in a defiladed area, approximately 1500 metres from Point 4875. Over the two days, on 2 and 3 July, weapons carriers from the 13 JAK Rifles and 28 Rashtriya Rifles dumped ammunition and heavy weapons. During the day of 4 July, the company commanders of 'A' and 'C' Companies, Major S.V. Bhaskar and Major Gurpreet Singh, conducted their final reconnaissance and showed the objectives to their 'O' groups.\nAt 1800 hours that same day, artillery bombardment of the infiltrator positions on Point 4875 commenced, and continued throughout the whole night. 155 mm Bofors Howitzers, 105 mm Field Guns, and multi barrel rocket launchers were used in the bombardment of Point 4875. At 2030 hours, under cover of artillery fire, 'A' and 'C' Companies began climbing the Point 4875. Capt Vikram Batra was excused from the offensive because he was down with fever and fatigue.\nBoth the assault companies were leading the offensive from the right flank. The soldiers had to take out enemy pockets of resistance which they encountered en route. However at one point, a strategically located machine gun halted the advance, and by first light the troops were still 50 meters short of the target. Now it was getting dangerous because in daylight, Indian soldiers could easily be seen by the Pakistanis. The attack was also halted by very effective sniper fire from Pakistani soldiers hiding behind rocks.\nAt 0430 hours, the two companies deployed their automatic weapons and began to fire at the well-fortified Pakistani positions at the top of the feature. The infiltrators were bringing down small arms fire and sniper fire, which effectively blocked the advance of the Indian troops. At around 1015 hours on 5 July, the commanding officer of 'C' company spoke to the battalion commanding officer and explained his company's predicament and the area from where the enemy was bringing in fire on them. Brigadier Kakkar was personally supervising operations. At this juncture, the battalion commanding officer, Lt Col Joshi personally fired two Fagot missiles in quick succession from the fire base and neutralised the position. Brigadier Kakkar watched the firing of the missiles through his binoculars. The bunker received a direct hit and the Pakistani soldiers were seen fleeing from it. The Indian troops then promptly began advancing again. Soon, Company C with two sections, led by Major Gurpreet Singh assaulted the enemy position. By 1300 hours, these troops had captured Point 4875. Subsequently, both 'A' and 'C' Companies linked up. They then consolidated their hold on Point 4875, however the Indian troops continued to receive artillery and machine-gun fire from Pimple 2 and area North of Point 4875.\nAt 2200 hours on 5 July, from a Pakistani position north of Point 4875, the infiltrators brought heavy and accurate fire on the two companies. In the early hours of the following morning at 0445 hours, 'C' Company reported they were in a heavy firefight and were running out of ammunition. Company B, the reserve company, promptly brought up the ammunition after which the firefight continued.\nThe Indian victory would not have been complete without the capture of 'Area Flat Top', an adjacent peak and part of Pakistani defences on Point 4875. But the infiltrators launched an immediate counterattack to take back the Area Flat Top they had lost. Young Captain NA Nagappa was holding Flat Top. He had a small force but he fought ferociously to beat back the offensive. The first counter-attack was beaten back. The Pakistanis too were facing the same problem of climbing, with the Indian Army on top shooting at them. A shell hit Area Flat Top, seriously injuring Captain Naveen Nagappa who was shooting at the advancing Pakistani soldiers. Splinters pierced through both his legs and he fell unconscious. Taking advantage of this situation, the Pakistanis started climbing faster.\nCapt Vikram Batra, who was observing the situation from base, went to his commanding officer and volunteered. Despite not in favor of deploying Batra to the field, he was deployed because of urgent need of reinforcement on the area flat top. Several of his battalion's soldiers volunteered to accompany Batra even before any Company could be ordered.\nIt was pitch black night when the newly formed Delta company under Capt Batra began the climb. On the night of 6–7 July, the opposing forces were so close that besides exchanges of small arms fire, verbal exchanges continued throughout the night. It was at this stage where it became imperative for Indian troops to destroy this Pakistani post, located north of Point 4875, from where fire was coming as otherwise the situation could become worse. At this juncture, the Indian troops detected the Pakistani presence on a long and narrow ledge, running north from Point 4875. On the ledge, the enemy were holding strong sangars echeloned one behind the other. En route to the top, Batra spotted a Pakistani machine gun position firing at the trapped Indian soldiers. Crouching, he moved toward the machine gun position, hiding behind rocks whenever possible. As he reached close to the enemy's machine gun position he lobbed a grenade, destroying the machine gun position. Before first light on the 7th, the troops succeeded in knocking out two more enemy machine guns, however, firing from the ledge continued. Batra's platoon soon reached the ledge, though by this time it was broad daylight.\nAt 0530 hours Lt. Col. Joshi spoke to Batra and asked him to reconnoiter the area. Batra, accompanied by Subedar Raghunath Singh and Major Bhat, his artillery observation officer, took out a patrol to recce a route to re-inforce Naveen from a flank. Batra located the position of the sangar on the ledge from which enemy machine guns were holding up the advance of his company. At this juncture, Batra, realising there was no way from the left or right, decided to make a direct assault in daylight itself. Under heavy fire from enemy machine guns and grenade firing launchers, Batra moved forward, screaming the battle cry of JAK RIF – Durga mata ki jai, and charged the sangar firing incessantly from his AK-47. He sustained grievous injuries in the process, yet he continued his charge, with supporting fire from the rest of the patrol, and upon reaching the very narrow entrance of the sangar and taking the enemy by complete surprise, he killed 5 Pakistani soldiers in a close-quarter battle. The attack resulted in seven Pakistani soldiers killed after which the Indians gained a foothold on the ledge. Taken by surprise by the attack, Pakistanis started retreating. Batra and his men had gained the upper hand by now. Batra pulled out a bleeding Naveen from the bunker. However, there was still a machine gun nest in action on that ledge that had to be silenced. Four Pakistani soldiers including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), who was guiding the fire on the Indian soldiers fighting outside, were manning the machine gun nest. Batra charged forward alone, killing all four members of the crew.\nBatra realised one of his men had been shot. Batra was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range in the process of rescuing this soldier, and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head. Batra collapsed next to the injured soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Popovska reka (Bulgarian: Поповска река) is a river in southern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the river Tundzha of the Maritsa drainage, with a length of 72 km. It is the second largest tributary of the Tundzha.\nThe river takes its source under the name Vodenska reka at an altitude of 482 m in the eastern part of the Dervent Heights, just north of the Bulgaria–Turkey border. In its upper course until the village of Voden it flows in a narrow forested valley, initially westwards and then northwards. Downstream of the village the river turns northwest. Its valley remains narrow but generally deforested until the town of Bolyarovo. After Bolyarovo the valley widens, the river makes meanders and changes direction several times — northeast after the town, northwest at Dabovo and southwest downstream of Popovo. The Popovska reka enters the Elhovo Field after the village of Dobrich. It flows into the Tundzha at an altitude of 98 m south of the town of Elhovo near the first class I-7 road.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 533 km2 or 6.32% of the Tundzha's total. The largest tributary is the Arapliyska reka (42 km).\nThe Popovska reka has predominantly rain feed with high water in February and low water in July–November. The average annual flow is at the Malko Sharkovo Reservoir is 0.9 m3/s.\nThe river flows entirely in Yambol Province. There are five settlements along its course, one town and four villages: Voden, Bolyarovo (town), Dabovo and Popovo in Bolyarovo Municipality, and Dobrich in Elhovo Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Soumaya Sahla (Dutch pronunciation: [suˈmaːjaː ˈsaːlaː]; born 5 July 1983) is a Dutch political scientist and radicalization expert.\nBorn in The Hague, Sahla was arrested in 2005, when she was living with Nouredine el Fahtni, a member of the Islamic terrorist cell Hofstad Network. She spent three years in prison for illegal firearms possession and membership of a terrorist organization. Her conviction was upheld in 2016 by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.\nSahla started studying political science in prison, and she continued with a PhD at Leiden University in 2018. She became an active member of the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in 2017 after she befriended its former leader, Frits Bolkestein. Allegations that she had used their relationship to obtain money, denied by Sahla, resulted in her expulsion from the VVD in 2023.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSahla was born in 1983 in The Hague's Stationsbuurt, and she grew up in the city's Transvaal neighborhood. She has seven siblings, and her parents had immigrated to the Netherlands from Morocco as guest workers. His father co-founded a mosque together with an Imam, and Sahla established its girl's association.\n\n\n== Terrorism case ==\nIntending to study abroad, Sahla moved in with a partner. However, upon learning he was disinterested in her academic ambitions, Sahla moved back with her parents. She finally ran away from her parental home in 2005, as she was pressured to reconcile the relationship. Sahla ended up at Nouredine el Fahtni, a distant relative and a member of the Islamic terrorist cell Hofstad Network.\nThey were arrested weeks later – in June 2005 – at Amsterdam Lelylaan station, when El Fahtni was carrying a loaded firearm. Police detectives found more weapons in September 2006 at a place where Sahla had been staying. She was prosecuted as part of the Piranha court case, and her conviction of illegal firearms possession and membership of a terrorist organization was made final by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 2016. She had already finished her three-year prison sentence in May 2008. The highest court determined she had been aware of El Fahtni's radical views. Sahla was acquitted of charges that she was helping to plot terrorist attacks against politicians including Geert Wilders despite her having discussed the home addresses of several politicians with her sister.\n\n\n== Education and VVD membership ==\nIn prison, Sahla started studying political science. She graduated from Leiden University, and she finished her master's in African studies in 2018. She continued with a PhD in philosophy of law. She met Frits Bolkestein, the former leader of the VVD, at a book presentation in 2011, and they became close friends. Bolkestein's 2018 book Bij het scheiden van de markt was dedicated to her. Sahla also had contact with politicians Gert-Jan Segers (CU) and Pieter Omtzigt (CDA). She became an active member of the VVD in 2017, joining its thematic networks and hosting debates and round tables as a radicalization expert. Besides, she sat on a radicalization and extremism advisory board of the municipality of Amsterdam.\nWilders started to attack Sahla in late 2021 on social media and in a debate in the House of Representatives – shortly after the election to the House of her sister, Fonda Sahla. He said that the VVD had taken in a Muslim terrorist and that he was worried for his safety. After Wilders's debate comments, VVD parliamentary leader Sophie Hermans called Sahla's membership a complicated matter. In a statement, Sahla declared she regretted the choices she had made earlier in her life, and she announced a partial retreat from her political activities. Wilders continued to criticize Sahla, including after an October 2023 radio appearance of her.\nOpinion magazine HP/De Tijd published an article on 30 October 2023 in which Sahla was accused by Martijn Bolkestein, the nephew of Frits Bolkestein, of abusing her friendship with Frits to obtain €85,000, when he had been ill and vulnerable. Sahla denied the allegations; she acknowledged that Bolkestein had payed for her PhD starting in 2018, but she said Bolkestein had been in good health at the time. She filed a criminal complaint against Martijn Bolkestein for defamation. The VVD expelled Sahla from the party the same day the article came out. She unsuccessfully appealed the board's decision, as the appeal committee argued the expulsion had resulted from a cumulation of incidents.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adnan Al-Bursh (1974 – c. 19 April 2024) was a Palestinian orthopedic surgeon and the head of orthopedics at the Gaza Strip's largest medical facility, Al-Shifa Hospital. He died in Ofer Prison after over four months of detention.\nThe 50-year-old doctor was arrested by Israeli forces in December 2023 while temporarily working at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza. Palestinian authorities and advocacy groups have attributed his death to torture or mistreatment in custody, and his death has been highlighted as part of the \"systematic targeting process against physicians and the health care system in Gaza.\"\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAdnan Al-Bursh was born in 1974 in Jabalia, the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, and received his early education there before traveling to Romania to study medicine.\nIn his career, he was a prominent Palestinian orthopedic surgeon who served as the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility. \nAl-Bursh was married and had five children. He served as an adviser to the Palestine national football team.\n\n\n=== Israel-Hamas war ===\nIn November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of Gaza, Al-Bursh was stranded in the besieged Al-Shifa Hospital for 10 days with his nephew. Israeli forces later asked them to move south, but Al-Bursh refused to comply and instead moved north to assist at the Indonesia Hospital. Al-Bursh's wife and six children also refused to move south and instead took shelter in one of the UNRWA schools in the northern Gaza Strip.\nAl-Bursh was later injured while at the Indonesian Hospital while he was in the operating room when Israeli forces also attacked that facility. Following a truce, he relocated again to Al-Awda Hospital, also in northern Gaza.\n\n\n== Arrest and death ==\nThe 50-year-old doctor was arrested by Israeli forces in December 2023 alongside 10 other workers while temporarily working at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza.\nFour months later, on 19 April 2024, the Israeli prison service confirmed Al-Bursh's death in custody at Ofer Prison, without disclosing the cause of his death. Palestinian authorities and advocacy groups have attributed his death to torture or mistreatment in custody. Released prisoners told Al-Bursh's family that he was being subjected to torture. His body was kept in Israeli custody, and the fate of the other detained medical workers remains uncertain.\nIn May 2024, the family of Al-Bursh instructed a lawyer in The Hague to investigate his death and hep facilitate the return of his body.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Prisoners' Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners Club labelled Al-Bursh's death an \"assassination\" and a part of the \"systematic targeting process against physicians and the health care system in Gaza.\" The Palestinian Ministry of Health called for an immediate investigation.\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, expressed her extreme alarm at the news of Al-Bursh's death and called for better protections.\nHis death was highlighted as a further example of the ongoing challenges and risks faced by healthcare workers in Gaza, with hundreds killed, injured or arrested. The Ministry of Health stated that 492 doctors had been killed in the conflict. The international community and human rights organizations have repeatedly called for an end to attacks on medical personnel and the protection of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.\nAl-Bursh's nephew, Mohammad Al-Bursh, described him as a \"cheerful\" and \"loved\" figure who dedicated his life to his profession, often working nonstop during the height of the conflict in Gaza. Colleagues praised him as a \"rare individual\" and the \"safety valve\" for orthopedic departments across Gaza's hospitals, often working tirelessly even during the height of conflicts in the region.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karahüyük (Elbistan) (also known as Karahöyük, Karahoyuk) is a village of Elbistan district of Kahramanmaraş province of Turkey. It is located 169 km to the north from Kahramanmaraş city and 9 km northwest from the Elbistan town.\nIn 1947, an important Anatolian hieroglyphic inscription stele was discovered near the village. This stele is believed to be from the 12th century BC.\nThe plain of Elbistan shares some history with Arslantepe (Melid). It is believed that Elbistan came under the control of Melid sometime around the 12th century BC. The Malatya group of the Neo-Hittite Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions have been studied by scholars. They come from the area of Karahöyük, and are believed to be very ancient.\nArchaeological excavations have also been conducted at Hamza Tepe, which is in the same area, 10 km northwest of Elbistan town, and to the west of Karahöyük. An ancient cremation cemetery from the Middle Iron Age (8th-7th centuries BC) has been discovered there.\nThe IZGIN hieroglyphic stele was also found in the area. It was found in 1882 in a cemetery near Izgın village. It was found actually standing among the monuments in that cemetery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHittites\nMaraş lion\nKahramanmaraş Archaeology Museum\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHawkins, J. D.

        "content": "Golden ochre, less often Gold Ochre (French: Ocre d’or, German: Gold Ocker от Ancient Greek: ὠχρός yellow-pale, orange or french ochre (obsolete)) — one of the most famous and brightly colored varieties of ochre — is a natural or (rarely) artificial pigment. In terms of mineral composition, golden ochre is clay with an admixture of aluminosilicates and a high content of the yellow dye itself, iron hydroxide, most often in the form of brown iron ore or limonite. The exact composition of ochre and its impurities vary greatly depending on the place of origin.\nGolden ochre is one of the oldest paints, known as a painting material since the times of cave paintings. In wall painting it is one of the main yellow pigments. Golden ochre has good density, the same covering power, high light fastness, pure color and soft structure. To this day it is used in all painting techniques without exception.\n\n\n== Description and properties ==\nThe golden ochre pigment is a natural mixture that consists primarily of crystalline iron oxide hydrate with some clay. The closest to golden ochre among related minerals is light ochre, which has a less warm and rich color. If in light ochre the content of the main dye, iron oxide hydrate, is quite low and ranges from 12 to 25%, then in golden ochre its amount can reach 70-75%. As a result, light ochre has a yellow color of a cooler tone and weaker color saturation and is considered a paint that is not bright and not intense. Golden ochre differs from it in its earthy tint and warmer tone.\n\nYellow ochres are more common in nature than others due to the abundance of their constituent minerals. When heated, orange and yellow ochre release water and gradually darken, acquiring an increasingly reddish tint. This occurs due to the transformation of iron hydroxide into a dark red anhydrous oxide (iron ochre). With controlled calcination of yellow ochre, almost the entire range of shades can be obtained from yellow and orange to red or brown.: 173 \nAmong other varieties of ochres, it was golden ochre that was valued above others; it was classified as the highest category of pigments in this category. In the 18th-19th centuries, golden ochre was supplied to the rest of Europe and Russia from the province of Rousillon, as a result of which the second name of this paint for a long time was French ochre.: 426  Of the total number of ochres, it is the golden ochre pigment that is closer in purity, brightness and shade all to Attic ochre, the most highly valued yellow paint of Ancient Greece and Rome.\nUntil the mid-20th century, picturesque yellow ochres were traditionally divided into fawn, yellow, saffron yellow, golden and orange. In the modern artist's palette, four types of nominal yellow ochre are most often encountered: light, medium, golden and dark. Natural and Italian sienna can also be considered among the same paints. In terms of composition, golden ochre should include at least 53% Fe2O3, 5% Al2O3 and 34% SiO2 with the complete absence of impurities such as CaO, MgO, MnO2 and insoluble sulfates. For comparison: of all yellow ochres, only dark ochre contains more iron oxide (more than 60%).: 173 \n\n\n== History and use ==\n\nGolden ochre is best known as a mineral pigment common in nature, primarily for artistic paints. It has been found since ancient times in rock paintings, frescoes of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. This pigment was also constantly used when painting temples and in icon painting. When analyzing the colorful composition of the icons of Theophan the Greek, despite all the restraint of his color scheme, golden ochre was clearly established.\nGolden ochre is also used in the production and restoration of expensive types of furniture. For example, when oil gilding on levkas (gesso), several layers of golden ochre are first applied in oil, and then, after drying and grinding, they are coated with oil gulfarbene varnish. As a result, the surface for gilding is perfectly matte and retains the color of the foil. Gilding on carvings looks especially impressive if shiny polished areas alternate with matte ones.\nAs an artist's paint, golden ochre has traditionally been a staple in artists palettes, primarily in oil painting, but also in tempera (including watercolor) and more recently, acrylic. It is stable both in pure form and in mixtures. However, when writing with tempera or watercolor, it is necessary to take into account one feature of ochre, dictated by its mineral nature: with a large amount of water-soluble film former, there is a risk of pigment precipitation (both alumina and iron hydroxide), so it is recommended to use ochre in the form of a thick paste.: 173 \nThe muted, slightly \"earthy\" shade of golden ochre makes it possible to achieve a soft and warm color palette of the painting and, in mixtures with brighter paints, to slightly \"reduce\" their color activity. There is one more feature. It is generally recommended to avoid very large, raised strokes with pure ochre, since due to the slow and incomplete drying of the layers to the full depth, uneven color and irregular matte surface may appear. The disadvantages of golden ochre include its vulnerability in case of close friction with metal (for example, in the case of rubbing with a palette knife). After some time, such contact can cause the ochre to turn green.\nOften light ochre or golden ochre is used to give the painting the impression of external monochrome or unity of color, and also to ensure that the light in the painting does not look colder than the shadow. In this case, ochre performs not only the function of enhancing the feeling of unity of the picture, but also an additional \"warming\" color.: 236 \nGolden ochre has been known and widely used as a stable, reliable and inexpensive pigment for any finishing, household and decorative purposes, suitable for painting both interior and exterior work. It does not fade and can withstand almost any weather conditions. A description of a similar use of golden ochre can be found in one of the stories of the Russian writer Sergeev-Tsensky: «...The hives were squat, wide, on four oak logs each, with pitched roofs, covered here with iron, here with plywood, but uniformly painted with golden ochre, cheerful in appearance».: 261 \nAlong with other types of ochre, golden ochre is traditionally widely used in tinting and painting ceramics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOchre\nAttic ochre\nOchre (disambiguation)\nIron ochre\nClay\nList of inorganic pigments\nList of colors\nYellow\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hıfzı Oğuz Bekata (17 March 1911 – 1 September 1995) was a Turkish lawyer and politician who was a long-term deputy and senator for Republican People's Party. He was the minister of state and the minister of interior in the coalition cabinets led by İsmet İnönü in the early 1960s. He was also a journalist and poet.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Ankara, Ottoman Empire, on 17 March 1911. He completed his secondary education at Bursa High School in 1931. He graduated from the Faculty of Law at Ankara University in 1935. While attending the university he established a cultural and youth magazine entitled Çığır (Turkish: Epoch) in 1933 which he edited and published until its closure in 1948.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nAs of 1939 Bekata headed the language, history and literature branch of the People's Houses, a cultural organization. Then he worked at the Ministry of Economy and Trade in various posts. He became a member of the Republican People's Party in 1942 and was elected to the Parliament from Ankara in 1943. His tenure at the Parliament lasted until 1950. Then he worked as a freelance lawyer.\nBekata was again elected as a deputy in 1957 and served at the Parliament until 1960. Following the military coup on 27 May 1960 the rule of the Democrat Party ended, and a Constituent Assembly was formed. Bekata was made a member of the Assembly in 1961. \nBekata was appointed minister of state to the coalition cabinet formed by İsmet İnönü in 1961. He was reappointed to the post on 25 June 1962. Then he was named as the minister of interior in the next cabinet again led by İnönü on 17 October 1962, succeeding Sahir Kurtoğlu in the post. Bekata had to resign from the post on 4 October 1963 due to his conflict with the minister of health, Yusuf Azizoğlu, a member of the New Turkey Party. The tension occurred when Bekata accused Azizoğlu of collaborating with the Kurdist leaders. Bekata was also acting minister of defense in the same cabinet and served as the government spokesman. Bekata's successor as minister of interior was İlyas Seçkin.\nBekata was elected from Ankara as a senator in 1963 and held the post until 1975. He was among the opponents of the concept of the left of center which was discussed in the CHP congress held in October 1966. Then he joined the 76s group within the party which rejected the leftist policies.\nBekata published four books between 1960 and 1970 which were about politics in Turkey and foreign policy of Turkey. He contributed to various publications and also, wrote many poems.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nBekata was married and had two daughter. He died on 1 September 1995.\nBekata's library containing books on history of science, technology, engineering, philosophy of science, political sciences, history and philosophy was donated to Istanbul Technical University.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palace-Monastery of Rudy (Polish: Pocysterski Zespół Klasztorno-Pałacowy w Rudach (Wielkich) or German: Schloss Rauden or (German: Kloster Rauden) is located in Rudy within the Racibórz County, Silesian Voivodeship, in southern Poland.\nThe gothic Cistercian monastery has been founded in the 13th century. During the 17th and 18th century, it was rebuilt in baroque style. It was a thriving school which included an impressive library. After the secularization, it became property of the prince of Hesse-Rothenburg and subsequently, the dukes of Ratibor and princes of Corvey, a branch of the Hohenlohe family. They made it their principal seat, which it remained up to the end of the Second World War. It was looted and set afire by the Red Army. The monastery church was immediately rebuilt, but the remaining buildings were only restored from the 1990s onwards. In 1998, it was transferred to the Diocese of Gliwice, and it has been an educational centre since, with the opportunity to stay the night over.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nin 1258, Vladislaus I of Opole (1225-1281/2), Duke of Opole–Racibórz, founded a Cistercian monastery in Rudy. The duke granted the abbey many privileges and granted them large estates and villages as well. The first monks came from the Jędrzejów Abbey in southern Poland. The first church was wooden. But the construction of a brick church started soon afterwards. It was completed around 1300 together with the eastern and western wings of the abbey. The church was consecrated in 1303.\nThe church of the monastery is dedicated to the Assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary. It is considered the oldest Marian shrine in Silesia. It attracted a lot of pilgrims, who wanted to see the image of the Virgin.\nCompared to other Cistercian monasteries, the income from the estate was not great although it had vineyards, and large forests and numerous streams around. The most important economic activity was related to the brewery, wine cellar and the distillery. Beer was brewed at least in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the start, the monastery was an educational centre as well.\nNames of abbots of these times have survived, like Peter I (1258–1274), Martin I (1456–1471) and Peter III (1471–1492).\nDuring the 15th and 16th century, the monastery was ravaged by war and looting due to the Hussite Wars, the Reformation and the Thirty Years War. Several times, the monastery was plundered. In 1625, there were only five monks left.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th century ===\n\nThe 17th and 18th century were the heyday of the monastery. The start of the new and better times are associated with abbot Andreas Emanuel Pospel and his successors. Between 1671 and 1680, abbot Pospel had the monastery and the church rebuilt in baroque style. A porch on the west side was erected in 1685. After a fire in 1724, the western façade was completely redone, and between 1785 and 1790 the church interior was modernized.\nIn the 18th century, the school was thriving and a boarding school was added in 1744. The library of the monastery included 18,000 books and prints.\nIn 1810, the monastery was secularized and went into ownership of the Prussian state. The last abbot was Bernhard Galbiers. The boarding school closed in 1816. The library was divided among Silesian libraries and partly donated to waste paper.\n\n\n=== Dukes of Ratibor and Princes of Corvey ===\n\nAfter the secularization, the monastery and its estates were handed over to the Prussian minister Wilhelm Ludwig Sayn-Wittgenstein (1770–1851). The monastery housed a military hospital for two years. In 1812, the monastery went into the hands of the crown prince of Hesse-Kassel, William II.\nIn 1820, Victor Amadeus, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg (1779–1834) became the new owner of the Rudy monastery and its estates. He started to transform the monastery into a princely residence. In both 1820 and 1822, he received in Rudy emperor Alexander I of Russia (1777–1825) as a guest.\nAlthough married twice, Victor Amadeus was childless and when he died in 1834, he bequeathed his possessions of the Silesian duchy of Ratibor (Czech: Ratiboř, Polish: Racibórz) and Prince of Corvey to his nephew, Victor, prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (1818–1893). These estates amounted to around 34,000 hectares in size and consisted mostly of forests. Besides the Rudy monastery, it also included the Corvey.\nVictor was a member of the House of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst and eldest son of Franz Joseph, 1st Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (1787–1841), who was married to a younger sister of Victor Amadeus's wife. In order to accept Victor Amadeus's inheritance, he waived his rights on the Schillingsfürst succession in favour his younger brother Chlodwig (1819–1901), who was to became Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia from 1894 to 1900.\nIn 1840, Victor was created duke of Ratibor and prince of Corvey on 15 October 1840 by king Frederick William IV of Prussia (1795–1861). Victor made Rudy his main seat and used the Corvey Abbey as his summer residence. He further renovated the palace monastery and created a large landscape park around the residence. The palace had around 120 rooms and halls.\n\nThe last big renovation happened between 1900 and 1901 under Victor's son, duke Victor II (1847–1923), who was born at the palace. Duke Victor II was married in 1877 to countess Maria Breunner-Enkevoirth (1856–1929), which brought the third great stately home in the Ratibor family, Schloss Grafenegg in Austria. The family belonged to the largest landowners in Germany.\nThe estate was often visited by royalty and higher nobility for the hunt: Field marshall Frederick von Wrangel and count Moltke in 1857; Frederick Francis II (1823–1883), grand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in 1860; the future emperor Frederick III (1831–1888) and his wife Victoria, Princess Royal (1840–1901) in 1866. Emperor Wilhelm II visited Rudy various times for hunts, and was often the best hunter of his group, but 1910 was his latest visit. Photojournalists captured him on picture and suggested in newspapers that pheasants were kept in baskets and were released as soon as the emperor took position. This made his hunt much easier and the fact that he was the best hunter less impressive. Scandal broke out and despite an intensive investigation, the duke was not able to find out who leaked the story. However, the emperor did not return to Rudy, and photojournalists were no longer invited to subsequent hunts.\nAfter the division of upper Silesia between Germany and Poland in 1922, Rudy remained on the German side of the border. In the time of National Socialism or Nazism, the family was reluctant to the new political system. However, it was not immune to the consequences. Duke Victor III (1879–1945) lost his eldest son, Victor IV, during the Invasion of Poland in 1939, who participated as a soldier of the invading armoured units.\nAt the end of the Second World War, the Ratibor-Corvey family had to flee Rudy for the advancing Russian troops. The Red Army looted the palace-monastery in Rudy and set it afire to hide their traces. Both the church and the princely residence were destroyed.\nDuke Victor III passed in Corvey. His titles and the castles in Corvey and Grafenegg were inherited by his son Franz-Albrecht Metternich-Sándor (1920–2009), who was adopted by the last member of the princely Metternich family, princess Clementine von Metternich-Sandor (1870–1963). The son of Franz Albrecht, Victor V, is the current duke and lives in Corvey.\n\n\n=== Communist Times ===\n\nWhen Silesia came under Polish administration after World War II, the remains of the palace monastery and its estate were confiscated by the government. The church was completely reconstructed in 1947 and became the village church. The remaining building remained in ruinous conditions as the authorities limited themselves to securing the site and nothing more. Although, in the 1970s, part of the site was tidied up and cleared from the rubble.\n\n\n=== Modern Times ===\nIn 1998, the palace monastery was transferred into the ownership of Diocese of Gliwice. An intensive renovation of the monastery and the palace rooms started, of which the first stage was completed in 2008. Also, the landscape park is being restored as well.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGessner, Adolf (1952).

        "content": "Lilian Seenoi-Barr (born October 1981) is a Kenyan-born Northern Irish politician and councillor for Derry City and Strabane District Council, where she represents the Social Democratic and Labour Party. On 29 April 2024, Seenoi-Barr made history after being selected as the next First Citizen of Derry City and Strabane, and consequently as Northern Ireland's first black mayor.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Narok, Kenya, Seenoi-Barr was initially raised in the village of Ol Ombokishi with her five sisters and eight brothers, and attended the village school until primary stage four. She then went to a school in Narok, where her mother ran a supermarket, and after secondary school attended university, where she studied women's reproductive health and community development. She became a prominent campaigner for gender rights among Massai women, focusing on forced marriage and female genital mutilation, but was forced to leave Kenya along with her son following threats to their safety because of her work with Maasai women. She first arrived in Northern Ireland as a refugee in 2010, after being invited to Derry by the Changaro Trust, which had helped to build schools in rural Kenya. The Changaro Trust subsequently helped Seenoi-Barr and her son to apply for refugee status. In 2012, she founded the North West Migrants Forum, and became its programme manager. She also helped to organise the Black Lives Matter protests that took place in Derry's Guildhall Square in June 2020.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nA member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, who previously served as chair of its Derry City and Strabane branch, Seenoi-Barr first stood for election to Derry City and Strabane District Council's Foyleside ward in 2019, but was not successful despite polling well. In June 2021, she was co-opted onto the council following Councillor Mary Durkan's decision to step down from her role as councillor. She retained her Foyleside seat at the 2023 election, and in doing so became the first black person to be elected to public office in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n=== Mayor of Derry and Strabane ===\nOn 29 April 2024, it was announced that Seemoi-Barr would become Northern Ireland's first black mayor after the Social Democratic and Labour Party appointed her as Derry and Strabane's First Citizen, succeeding Sinn Féin's Patricia Logue. She will become mayor at the Council's Annual General Meeting in June. Responding to the announcement, Seemoi-Barr said she was \"proud to be a Maasai woman and a Derry girl. I cannot express how much the honour of serving as mayor of Derry and Strabane means to me.\" Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and the Member of Parliament for Foyle, described Seenoi-Barr's appointment as \"a historic moment\" and said she \"will be an incredible mayor\".\nHowever, Seenoi-Barr's appointment attracted criticism from some within her party, who felt the way the decision was made was undemocratic. Jason Barr, serving as deputy mayor of Derry and Strabane at the time of Seenoi-Barr's appointment, resigned from the Social Democratic and Labour Party, saying he had been \"left in an untenable position due to the decisions made by the management committee\". The appointment prompted a second resignation from the party a few days later, when Shauna Cusack became an independent councillor. On 4 May, * 4 May, the Social Democratic and Labour Party announced it would make changes to the way it made \"civil leadership\" appointments following the resignations.\nNews of her appointment attracted online abuse from prominent far-right figures and conspiracy theorists, such as Alex Jones and David Icke. Jones claimed in a post on X that \"The WEF (World Economic Forum) is now installing invaders as mayors in Ireland just like in London\". In response to this, and other online abuse, Seenoi-Barr said she was \"aware\" of it but \"genuinely not interested\", while Michelle O'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, said those purporting the abuse \"do not speak for the wonderful and welcoming people of Derry and Strabane, and the work being done to build a better future for all\". On 5 May, a man was arrested by police in Derry after making online threats to Seenoi-Barr following the announcement of her selection as mayor.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSeenoi-Barr has a son who was born in Kenya and came to Northern Ireland with her. She met her husband after arriving in Northern Ireland. Her brother, Ledama Olekina, is a member of the Kenyan Senate representing the Narok area.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Raymond Arnett (June 14, 1924 – June 20, 2019) was an American conservationist, government official, and lobbyist who was the California Fish and Game Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.\n\n\n== Early life and military service ==\nArnett was born on Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia and moved to California when he was seven years old. He graduated from Point Loma High School in San Diego and briefly attended the University of California, Los Angeles before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps at the start of World War II. He was sworn into the Marines by his father, Roscoe Arnett, who was the officer in charge of Marine recruiting in Southern California. Arnett served with the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific and received a field commission in the South Pacific. After the war, he was sent to the University of Southern California to take part in the V-12 College Training Program. He received a second lieutenant commission and earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in petroleum engineering and geology. He was recalled to active duty in 1950 and served for eighteen months during the Korean War before receiving an honorable discharge.\n\n\n== Career ==\nArnett graduated from the University of Southern California in 1947 spent twenty years as a geologist for the Richfield Oil Corporation.  He led a team that drilled the first oil and gas well on the Kenai Peninsula. He later worked in the public relations department of ARCO.\nIn 1960, he was the Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives seat in California's 14th congressional district. He lost to four-term incumbent Harlan Hagen 56% to 44%. He ran against Hagen again in 1962 (this time in the 18th district), and lost 59% to 41%.\nFrom 1969 to 1975, Arnett was Fish and Game Commissioner of California. From 1976 to 1978, he was president of the National Wildlife Federation. From 1981 to 1984, he was Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\nOn January 26, 1985, Arnett was appointed interim executive vice president of the National Rifle Association by the group's board of directors. On April 20, 1985, he defeated Neal Knox 2,014 votes to 887 to win a five-year term. On May 17, 1986, the NRA board of directors fired Arnett, alleging that he had used organization funds to pay for personal hunting trips, fired the entire public education staff without consulting the board, and promoted a female employee with whom he had a personal relationship.\nAfter leaving the NRA, Arnett founded Arnett Associates, a consulting firm that assisted businesses with the state and federal permitting processes. He died on June 20, 2019, at a nursing home in Stockton, California.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nowon A (Korean: 노원구 갑) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Nowon District, Seoul. As of 2024, 224,187 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nThroughout its history, Nowon A has displayed swing seat tendencies, having voted for both conservative and liberal political parties to represent the constituency in the National Assembly.\nBaek Nam-chi of the centre-right Reunification Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency. Baek narrowly won re-election in 1992 and 1996, having received 34.91% and 36.77% of the vote respectively. Ahead of the 2000 election, the Grand National Party did not renominate incumbent Baek Nam-chi as the party's candidate for Nowon A, having nominated former Minister of Energy and Resources Choe Dong-kyu instead. In response to this, Baek left the Grand National Party and joined the right-wing United Liberal Democrats on February 23, 2000. Baek unsuccessfully ran for re-election under the United Liberal Democrats banner, coming in third place. He was succeeded by Ham Seung-hee of the liberal Millennium Democratic Party. Ham was defeated in the following election by Chung Bong-ju of the liberal Uri Party. Chung unsuccessfully ran for re-election in 2008, being defeated by Hyun Gyoung-byoung of the conservative Grand National Party. However, Hyun lost his seat on June 10, 2011, having been found guilty of receiving ₩30,000,000. A by-election for Nowon A was not held as South Korean election law does not allow for by-elections to held when less than one year is left until the next election.\nIn the 2012 South Korean legislative election, former Mayor of Nowon District Lee No-keun of the conservative Saenuri Party won the seat. Lee narrowly lost to Democratic Party challenger Koh Yong-jin in the following election, having lost by less than three points. A return match between Koh and Lee unfolded in the 2020 election, which saw Koh secure 56.78 and defeat Lee by more than eighteen points. Ahead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Woo Won-shik was designated as the Democratic Party's candidate after defeating incumbent Koh Yong-jin in a party primary. The People Power Party nominated former assemblyman Hyun Gyoung-byoung. Woo went on to defeat Hyun in the general election, securing 58.99% of the vote.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Wolgye-dong, Gongneung-dong, and Junggye-dong. It borders the constituencies of Nowon B to the north, Dobong A to the northwest, Gangbuk B to the west, Seongbuk B to the southwest, Jungnang B to the south, and Guri to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This play was his first and was based on the real life of an Italian charcoal-burner, Biondiette, found guilty of murdering his mate who was condemned and hanged on circumstantial evidence.\nThe Australasian said \"It is a good play of the sensation order, and it has some excellent points. \"\nThe Age called it \"a good effective drama of its kind.\"\nThe Advocate called it \"a good acting drama.\"\nThe Leader said \"the language is forcible, the interest of the action is well kept up, and does not exceed the licence accorded to the dramatist to create effects by the introduction of sensational incidents. \"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) is an umbrella political body which represents the broadest spectrum of Syrian revolution and opposition forces. It is a functional entity whose mandate is to negotiate with the Syrian regime within UN-sponsored pathways. It is currently led by Bader Jamous.\nIn December 2015, various Syrian opposition forces convened Riyadh I Conference in Saudi Arabia. It was attended by around 150 opposition figures and the formation of the Syrian Negotiation Commission (at the time named High Negotiation Commission) was declared at the end of the conference.\nIn December 2015, the Security Council issued resolution no. 2254 which provided for launching formal negotiations between representatives of the Syrian opposition and of the regime in order to reach a durable political settlement and establish a credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governing body, adopting a pathway for the drafting of a new constitution for Syria and holding free elections under UN auspices. The United Nations then officially recognized the SNC as the sole representative of the Syrian opposition.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe SNC comprised 37 members representing six components\n\n 8 from the National Coalition of Revolution and Opposition Forces\n 5 from the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change Forces\n4 from Cairo Platform\n4 from Moscow Platform\n7 from military factions\n8 independents\n1 from the Kurdish National Council\nThe SNC launched the Executive Framework for a Political Solution in Syria. It held that a political solution must be based on Geneva Communique\nand UNSCRs 2118 and 2254  which provide for the establishment of a transitional governing body with full executive powers.\nThe SNC then took part in the UN-sponsored Geneva III and Geneva IV negotiations. The SNC also sent an advisory delegation to Astana I negotiations which were held under the auspices of Russia and Türkiye as guarantors.\nIn February 2017, the fourth round of Geneva negotiations were held and the UN Special Envoy to Syria presented four baskets to negotiate, namely:\n\n Establishment of credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance\n Drafting a new constitution\n Holding free and fair elections pursuant to a new constitution\nCounter terrorism.\nIn November 2017, the SNC held Riyadh II Conference  in which it discussed expanding the SNC to broaden representation and involve more national figures in the SNC particularly from inside Syria and increasing women representation.\nThe SNC asserted that its mandate was to negotiate with the regime to realize a democratic political transition through the establishment of a transitional governing body capable of preparing a safe and neutral environment within which the transitional process proceeds in accordance with international resolutions.\nIn September 2019, the UN Secretary General announced the establishment of the Syrian Constitutional Committee. The Large Body of the Constitutional Committee comprised 150 members divided equally on the three parties: the SNC, the Syrian regime and civil society.\n\n\n== Geneva II ==\nMain article: Geneva II Conference on Syria\nGeneva II Conference for Peace in Syria (or simply Geneva II) was a UN-backed international conference held in Geneva with the aim of ending the conflict in Syria, by bringing together the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition.\n\n\n== Geneva III ==\nMain article: Geneva Peace Talks on Syria (2016)\nSyrian peace talks in Geneva, also known as Geneva III, were peace negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition in Geneva under the auspices of the UN and the Vienna peace talks group on Syria and the UN Security Council.\n\n\n== Geneva IV ==\nMain article: Geneva Peace Talks on Syria (2017)\nThe Geneva IV peace talks on Syria were peace negotiations between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\n\n== Geneva VIII ==\nThe last round of Geneva talks, also known as Geneva VIII, was held in November 2017 and was concluded on 15 December when then UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan De Mistura, declared that “negotiations, in reality, in the end, did not take place”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shaun Walker (born 1981/82) is a British journalist noted for his writing on Ukraine, and Russia. Walker visited Russia for the first time as an 18-year-old, in 2000, working as an English teacher, and then travelling around the country. Walker then returned to the UK, where he studied Russian and  Soviet history at Oxford University. After completing his studies, Walker returned to Moscow at the end of 2003, working for an NGO for a year, before taking up journalism. Walker was the Moscow correspondent for The Independent from 2007 to 2013. From 2014 to 2018, Walker was The Guardian's correspondent for Russia and Ukraine. \nIn his time working for the Independent and Guardian, Walker frequently expressed his support for Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny. Working for the Guardian, Walker has extensively covered the war in Donbas.  Walker wrote a downbeat 'farewell' article to Russia in early 2018, stating that he would return for the upcoming  World Cup, but after that he was 'off for real', expressing his desire to return to see a 'post- Putin' Russia. Walker did return for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, this time writing an upbeat article about the \"positive atmosphere: the street parties, the surprisingly lax police presence, the good-natured welcome from the majority of Russians, and the hot weather and cheap beer.\" \nFrom 2019, Walker has been the Guardian's central and eastern Europe correspondent. He has received praise for his writing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Walker has also been criticised for some his pro-Russian writings prior to 2022, including a 2014 article for the Guardian entitled \"I can't stop dreaming about Vladimir Putin\", and his positive comments on Russia at the time of the 2018 World Cup. Walker was shortlisted for the 2024 UK Press Awards.\nWalker is the author of two non-fiction books, 2014's Odessa Dreams: The Dark Heart of Ukraine's Online Marriage Industry, and 2018's The Long Hangover: Putin's New Russia and the Ghosts of the Past.    \nWalker currently lives in Budapest, Hungary.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n2014 - Odessa Dreams: The Dark Heart of Ukraine's Online Marriage Industry\n2018 - The Long Hangover: Putin's New Russia and the Ghosts of the Past\n\n\n== See also ==\nOliver Bullough\nLuke Harding\nPeter Hitchens\nTim Judah\nEdward Lucas\nSarah Rainsford\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nuphar × rubrodisca is a species of rhizomatous aquatic plant native to Canada and the USA. It is a natural hybrid of Nuphar variegata and Nuphar microphylla.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Vegetative characteristics ===\nNuphar × rubrodisca has 1–2.5 cm wide rhizomes. The petiolate leaves float on the water surface, or are more rarely submersed.\n\n\n=== Generative characteristics ===\nThe red stigmatic disk has 8-15 stigmatic rays.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\n\n=== Vegetative reproduction ===\nIt can reproduce vegetatively through rhizome fragments.\n\n\n=== Generative reproduction ===\nIt can be sterile or fertile. The fertility rates are much lower than those of the parental species.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n\n=== Publication ===\nIt was first described by Thomas Morong in 1886.\n\n\n=== Natural hybridisation ===\nHybridisation events of both parental species are believed to have occurred many times independently from each other.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\nIt occurs in streams, tidal waters, ponds, and lakes at elevations of 0–400 m above sea level. It occurs almost exclusively within the overlapping ranges of the parental species.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "University Avenue is a downtown street in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. It runs for around 0.19 miles (0.31 km), from St. George Street in the north to Loomis Street in the south. It was the original main access road to the University at Lewisburg (Bucknell University today), located on the northern side of the campus, and still leads to its former main entrance, punctuated by the 1905 Memorial Gateway. The Grove, a wooded area, stands inside the gates.\nThe university's oldest residence hall, Old Main (today known as Daniel C. Roberts Hall), stands atop College Hill, which begins its rise inside Memorial Gateway. It was built in 1858, when the school was known as the University at Lewisburg, and was rebuilt after fire in the 1930s.\nSeveral fraternity and sorority buildings stand on University Avenue, including Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma Delta, while President's House is located at the intersection with Loomis Street, across from Lowry House (former home of hymn-writer Robert Lowry). The Union County Industrial Railroad passes beside both of these buildings as it crosses University Avenue.\nLimestone Run, a branch of both Bull Run and Miller Run, passes beneath University Avenue in its northern third. It empties into the West Branch Susquehanna River a short distance to the southeast. Its final stretch passes through what was formerly a lush area known as the Meadows.\n\n\n== Notable addresses ==\n\nFrom north to south:\n\n20 University Avenue\nResidence Hall, 23 University Avenue\n28 University Avenue (1864)\nBliss–McClure House, 63 University Avenue\nKappa Sigma House (formerly), 64 University Avenue\nPhi Gamma Delta House, 78 University Avenue (1915)\nJudd House, 79 University Avenue\nCooley Hall, 82 University Avenue\nAlumni House, 90 University Avenue\nPresident's House, 103 University Avenue\nLowry House, 110 University Avenue\nThe former carriage house beside number 63 was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. The home was once the residence of George R. Bliss, a professor at Bucknell.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gábor Rappert–Vencz (born July 7, 1967) is a Romanian actor, freelance performer, musician, and presenter of Hungarian ethnicity.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nHe was born in 1967 in Timișoara into a theatrical family of Hungarian ethnicity. His father was a noted actor from Timișoara, Károly Rappert. He completed his elementary and high school education in his hometown. After finishing high school, he studied acting at the István Szentgyörgyi Institute of Theatre Arts in Târgu Mureș. He graduated as an actor in 1990 and immediately joined the Hungarian section of the North Theatre of Satu Mare, where he remained a member until October 2011 (as one of the leading actors of the company). He was a member of the company's artistic council and the Proscenium Foundation. In 2006, he was awarded the György Kovács Prize for his artistic work. \nIn addition to his acting career, he also worked as a media personality and presenter. For years, he was a presenter on the Hungarian radio station in Satu Mare, City Rádió, and also hosted programs on Romanian Television's Hungarian broadcasts. In October 2011, shortly after the resignation of Csongor Zsolt Nagy, he followed suit, but emphasized that unlike his colleague, he was willing to fulfill the roles already assigned to him in the ongoing productions. During the aftermath of their resignations, a \"declaration war\" ensued, with many local politicians, patrons, and viewers coming to their defense, while sharp criticisms were also made. The artistic leadership of the Northern Theater of Satu Mare refuted the accusations formulated by them at a press conference, and several of their colleagues from Satu Mare (Ágnes Lőrincz, István Bessenyei, István István, and Zsuzsa Némethy) criticized their decision in an open letter and asked them to reconsider their position. The controversy was put to an end by a joint press release written by the majority of the members of the North Theater of Satu Mare, expressing both their regret for the decisions of their former colleagues (assuring them that they were ready to take them back if they were to reconsider) and their intention to continue envisioning the future under the leadership of Attila Keresztes. Since 2012, Rappert has been working as a freelance actor and performer, commercial and voice-over actor, and television presenter, collaborating with the Romanian section of the North Theater of Satu Mare and various cultural associations.\n\n\n== Roles ==\n\n\n=== Major roles at the North Theater of Satu Mare ===\nBilly Flynn (Bob Fosse – Fred Ebb – John Harold Kander: Chicago, directed by Attila Keresztes)\nKaa (Péter Geszti – Pál Békés – László Dés: The Jungle Book, directed by Regina Szilágyi)\nPrince Conti (David Hirson: La Bête, directed by Géza Bodolay)\nMar-Szúr Prince, Bögöl Prince (Andor Szilágyi: Leander and Lenszirom, directed by Attila Keresztes)\nPolonius (Csaba Kiss: Return to Denmark, directed by István Albu)\nVershinin, Alexander Ignatyevich, Lieutenant Colonel, Battery Commander (Anton Chekhov: Three Sisters, directed by Attila Keresztes)\nHarsányi Dénes Junior, Lawyer (István Tasnádi: Pork Preserve, directed by Csaba Tasnádi)\nChiriac (Ion Luca Caragiale: A Stormy Night, directed by Árpád Árkosi)\nKerekes Ferkó (Imre Kálmán: Countess Maritza, directed by Attila Keresztes)\nZürcsev (György Aldobolyi-Nagy – József Romhányi: Mad Sunday, directed by György Aldobolyi-Nagy)\nPaja (Miklós Munkácsy: The Beatles to the End, directed by Csongor Csurulya)\nMaster Builder Solness (Henrik Ibsen: Légvár, directed by Csongor Csurulya)\nMigraine (Michel André – Szabolcs Fényes – Iván Szenes: Lulu, directed by József Czintos)\nAlmády (Ferenc Molnár: Play in the Castle, directed by Miklós Parászka)\nKálmán Boér (Géza Csáth: Janika, directed by László Bérczes)\nJóska Buga (Sándor Rideg – Péter Timár: The Bailiff Is Leaving, directed by Árpád Árkosi)\nFiliberto (Carlo Goldoni: A Strange Story, directed by Csongor Csurulya)\nStentorian Voice, Captain Latzi, Othello, Firefighter (József Gaál: The Notary of Peleske, directed by András Schlanger)\nAntonio, Venetian Merchant (Shakespeare: The Merchant of Venice, directed by Miklós Parászka)\nGabi, Agitator (János Háy: The Senák, directed by Zoltán Lendvai)\nFrantisek (Tibor Déry: Imagined Report on an American Pop Festival, directed by László Horányi)\nAlberto Saporito (Eduardo de Filippo: Internal Voices, directed by Alexandre Colpacci)\nJohn Proctor (Witch Hunt, based on The Crucible by Arthur Miller, directed by Péter Uray)\nFélix Hübner (Dezső Szomory: Györgyike, Dear Child, directed by Zoltán Lendvai)\nJean, Butler (Mihály Szüle – László Walter – Imre Harmath: One Fool Makes a Hundred, directed by Miklós Parászka)\nII.

        "content": "Sita Navami (Sanskrit: सीतानवमी, romanized: Sītānavamī) is a Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of the goddess Sita, one of the most popular deities in Hinduism, and an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi. It is celebrated on the navami (ninth day) of the Shukla Paksha (first lunar fortnight) of the Hindu month of Vaishakha.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nAccording to the Ramayana, the infant Sita appeared or manifested from a divine earthen pot in the kingdom of Mithila from a farm field to King Siradhvaja Janaka and Queen Sunayana. According to regional tradition, this site is identified to be at the Punaura Dham of the Sitamarhi district of Bihar, India. The date and time of the manifestation of the infant Sita is recorded as the ninth day of Shukla Navami in the Vaishakha month of Pushya nakshatra in the Ramayana. It is said that when King Siradhvaja Janaka was ploughing the land with a plow, a part of his plough got stuck in the earth. On digging that place, he found an infant girl in an earthen pot. A tip of the plow is called Sita, and hence the girl was named Sita and was adopted as the king's daughter. Sita later married Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. Sita is revered for her loyalty, devotion and sacrifice to her husband. She is considered the epitome of womanhood and is regarded as the ideal wife and mother in the Indian subcontinent.  \n\n\n== Description ==\nSita Navami celebrates the anniversary date of the appearance or manifestation of Sita. On the occasion of Sita Navami, married women fast for their husbands's long life.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Song Yu-in (Korean: 송유인; Hanja: 宋有仁; ? – October 18, 1179) was a Goryeo military official who served the Goryeo military regime. The son-in-law of military ruler Chŏng Chung-bu, he was killed when Kyŏng Tae-sŭng took control of the government from his father-in-law. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nSong Yu-in was the son of a man who died defending Goryeo during the reign of King Injong. Due to his father's death on behalf of the nation, Song Yu-in was granted the rank of executive captain (산원; 散員; sanwŏn) via protected appointment. Song rose through the ranks to become tae'ja pujiyu (태자부지유; 太子府指諭) then general of the guards (위장군; 衛將軍; wi changgun). He married the ex-wife of a Song dynasty merchant. Despite being from the lowly cheonmin class, Song's wife was wealthy. Song was able to use his wealthy wife's money to bribe the eunuchs and obtained a government post. By the 1170 military coup, Song had achieved the rank of grand general (대장군; 大將軍; daejanggun).\nDue to Song's connections to the civilian officials, Song was disliked by the other military officials who despised the civilian officials for their treatment of the Goryeo military. After the 1170 Goryeo military coup, Song abandoned his wife and married the daughter of Chŏng Chung-bu, one of the ringleaders of the coup, in order to avoid persecution. Song would be appointed the military commissioner (병마사; 兵馬使; pyŏngmasa) of Seobukmyeon. However, when he was unable to deal with local revolts, he feigned illness and resigned as commissioner, and was replaced by General U Hak-yu (우학유; 于學儒).\nOn January 23, 1175, Song Yu-in was appointed as vice commissioner of the Security Council (추밀원부사; 樞密院副使; ch'umilwŏnpusa) and the minister of war (병부상서; 兵部尙書; pyŏngbu sangsŏ). On January 30, Song was replaced as the minister of war by Chin Chun (진준; 陳俊), and Song was appointed as the minister of justice (형부상서; 刑部상서; hyŏngbu sangsŏ) instead. Song would later also be promoted to Assistant Executive in Political Affairs (참지정사; 參知政事; ch'amji chŏngsa), and by the request of his wife, the daughter of Chŏng Chung-bu, he was promoted to Secretariat for State Affairs Vice Director (상서복야; 尙書僕射; Sangsŏ pogya).\nIn 1178, when Chŏng retired from his government offices, Song Yu-in was given the office of the Vice-Director of the Chancellery (문하시랑평장사; 門下侍郎平章事; munhasirang p'yŏngjangsa). Song was also given permission from King Myeongjong to use Suchang Palace as Song's own residence. In 1179, he impeached Confucian scholar-officials Mun Kŭk-kyŏm and Han Mun-jun, demoting them from their positions at the Security Council. On October 18, Song and his father-in-law were killed by Kyŏng Tae-sŭng who opposed the rule of Chŏng  and his family.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

ICJP membership consists of lawyers, academics and politicians.\n\n\n== Actions ==\nIn August 2023, following a report by The Guardian suggesting an attempt by the Israeli Embassy in the UK to influence a court case, ICJP issued a statement \"strongly condemn[ing]\" what it described as the Israeli Embassy attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to court cases related to actions by Palestine Action.\nIn October and November 2023, ICJP submitted a legal analysis to the parliament of the United Kingdom, giving advice on UK relations with the Middle East and North Africa in relation to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the proposed two-state solution.\nIn November 2023, ICJP stated to Canadian government officials that it would file court cases against Canadian politicians involved in war crimes in the Israel–Hamas war committed by Israelis. The ICJP referred to Canadian obligations under Article 25(3)(c) and (d) of the Rome Statute not to aid and abet the commission of war crimes and to possible investigations and prosecutions by the International Criminal Court or under universal jurisdiction.\nIn April 2024, ICJP stated that if evidence were fund that the Elbit Hermes 450 drone responsible for the World Central Kitchen aid convoy attack were made in the UK, then pressure would increase to stop UK arms sales to Israel.\nIn May 2024, ICJP stated that the ban on the entry of Glasgow University rector Ghassan Abu-Sittah into Schengen Area countries, including Germany and France, was a violation of freedom of speech. ICJP stated that it was requesting lawyers in France and Germany to take action in opposition to the ban.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Han's Laser (Chinese: 大族激光; pinyin: Dàzú Jīguāng) is a publicly listed Chinese company that engages in the manufacture and sale of industrial laser equipment. It is one of the largest laser companies in China.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1996, Han's Laser was founded in Shenzhen by Gao Yunfeng who previously taught at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The idea came after Gao helped to repair a foreign industrial machine for a friend as at the time foreign firm's did not pay much attention to foreign markets and the repair process took a long time. Using CNY400,000 from his friend as payment for the repairs. Gao decided to rent a house in Shenzhen to start his business.\nThe location was chosen as it attracted a lot of young college graduates across the country that it could recruit for its research and development (R&D) unit.\nWhen Han's Laser first started, it provided services to button makers by printing logos on them.\nTo raise capital for the company, Gao had to give up his controlling stake of the company to investors such as Shenzhen HTI Group.\nIn 2000, Han's Laser hired Wang Daheng as a technology consultant to the company. The company hired other academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences which contributed to the rise of its R&D strength.\nIn 2001, Gao had a conflict with Han's Laser's management team chosen by Shenzhen HTI Group. As a result, he went to loan sharks to borrow money to repurchase enough shares of the company to regain control. The company restructured as a result. During the same year, Han's Laser stated expanding into overseas markets.\nIn 2004, Han's Laser held its initial public offering and became a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\nDue to the Made in China 2025 policy, there was a large demand for laser equipment which benefitted Han's Laser. Compared to its peers, Han's Laser product line covered a larger range of industries.\nIn November 2016, Han's Laser acquired CorActive High-Tech, a  manufacturer of specialty optical fiber and fiber laser modules based in Quebec, Canada.\nOn 5 March 2019, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange notified the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that shares of Han's Laser could no longer be purchased via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program as foreign ownership of the company had already exceeded the 28% threshold and was close to the 30% hard limit. At the time, this was only the second stock in the program's history to approach an upper limit for foreign ownership. MSCI which had previously included the company in its China All Shares Index removed it on 11 March citing potential investability issue for investors.\nIn May 2023, it was reported that Han's Laser had purchased 262 acres in Manor, Texas which was speculated to be a project to build a factory there that could grow to provide over 1,000 jobs in the area.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn July 2019, Tiger Vision Financial Research released a report that questioned the authenticity of Han's Laser's European R&D center project in Switzerland. It claimed that the funds of CNY1.1 billion for it were embezzled to build a luxury hotel instead. In response, Han's Laser made a statement on East Money that stated the European R&D center was an independent project and that there were no misappropriation of funds. Shares of the company declined by 9.11% afterwards. A visit to the registered address of the  R&D center in Engelberg revealed it was only a room of about 10 square meters.\nIn August 2019, Gao was interviewed on a China Central Television program where he was asked about the embezzlement scandal. Gao lashed out at the reporter asking if the reporter was qualified to question him. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange criticized Gao's remarks. Shortly afterwards, Han's Laser issued a statement apologizing for Gao's remarks. Despite this, shares of Han's declined 8.8% on that day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Battle of Giedraičiai (Lithuanian: Giedraičių mūšis) was fought on November 17–21, 1920, between the Lithuanian Army and a part of the Polish Army led by Lucjan Żeligowski, which called itself the Army of Central Lithuania.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn October 9, 1920, General Lucjan Żeligowski's forces occupied Vilnius as part of his false-flag mutiny. His forces mainly consisted of the 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Infantry Division and the 13th Vilnius Uhlan Regiment. The Polish forces did not stop their attack after occupying Vilnius and instead attacked towards the west and north-west. They reached Rūdiškės on October 10, and then Nemenčinė on October 11. \nThe Poles continued their offensive on both sides of the Neris river on October 13. This Polish attack pushed back the 3rd Infantry Division under Ignas Musteikis from the Vokė–Lentvaris line to Semeliškės–Rykantai line. On 14–15 October, the 3rd Division stopped Żeligowski's attack in the western direction on the left bank of the Neris river at the line of Vievis–Valkininkai.\nThe Polish attack on the right bank of the Neris (in the north-west direction) was stronger and the 1st Infantry Division (2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiments) under Stasys Nastopka retreated fighting. The positions at Papiškės, Geležiai, Bukiškės and Bajorai had to be abandoned and the 1st Division retreated to the Šilėnai-Žalesa line. The Poles occupied the towns ofŠvenčionėliai, Širvintos, Giedraičiai. \nOn October 21, the 13th Uhlans invaded the Lithuanian rear and captured the 1st Infantry Division's headquarters.\nBy 27 October, Żeligowski's army had occupied Želva and Vidiškiai and threatened to cut the Ukmergė-Utena road. \nThe 1st Infantry Division (now composed of the 2nd, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiments and commanded by Edvardas Adamkavičius) counterattacked and retook Želva, and liberated Giedraičiai on November 1. The front stopped at the Kernavė–Musninkai–Širvintos–Giedraičiai–Dubingiai–Švenčionėliai line. The front briefly stabilized.\nThe League of Nations decided to resolve the Polish–Lithuanian War over the Vilnius Region by plebiscite. Thus, it sent the League's Military Control Commission to the conflict zone. Żeligowski was forced to hurry because his soldier's combativeness gradually weakened and he still sought to seize more Lithuanian territory.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== November 17: Polish offensive begins ===\nIn the early morning of November 17, the Poles launched a new offensive on the 30 km section of the Širvintos–Giedraičiai–Dubingiai front. Two infantry brigades, supported by artillery, attacked towards Širvintos and Giedraičiai, and a cavalry brigade of eleven squadrons broke through to the rear of the Lithuanian army at the Dubingiai gorge in the direction of Videniškiai–Kurkliai.\n\nThe 2nd Infantry Regiment defending Giedraičiai was hit the hardest. To avoid encirclement, on the evening of November 17, the regiment retreated to the Želva-Balninkai line. The 7th Infantry Regiment, defending Širvintos, retreated to positions in the Viesos–Liūnai–Degučiai section after fierce fighting. The 4th Infantry Regiment, which defended the Musninkai front, remained unmoved from its positions. The Polish cavalry, having crossed Šventoji near Kavarskas, pushed deep into Lithuania and reached the vicinity of Kėdainiai. The Lithuanian army was threatened with encirclement.\nEdvardas Adamkavičius, commanding the 1st Division, approved the plan put forth by the meeting of the 7th Infantry Regiment's officers. The plan to bypass Širvintos and attack the Poles from the flank and rear was originally proposed by Teodoras Balnas, the commander of the 7th Regiment's 3rd Battalion.\n\n\n=== November 18: Polish debacle due to Lithuanian attack ===\nOn the evening of November 18, Balnas formed a group of 170-200 soldiers, which he led in a 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) march through the forest at night. The group attacked the battalion of the Polish Grodno Regiment stationed near the village of Motiejūnai. During the battle, the Grodno regiment's commander Seweryn Rymaszewski was killed. The headquarters of the Polish 2nd Lithuanian–Belarusian Brigade and the Grodno regiment were captured, totalling about 200 prisoners. The Lithuanians conquered many war trophies, which included two cannons, nine mortars, twenty machine guns, and many wagons. The Grodno regiment's remaining two battalions were scattered by Lithuanian forces in the vicinity of Širvintos. After regrouping, the Poles soon occupied Širvintos again. \n\n\n=== November 19–21: Lithuanian counter-offensive ===\nOn the morning of November 19, the Lithuanian army commander General Silvestras Žukauskas arrived in Ukmergė and organized a counterattack with the entire front. The 2nd Infantry Regiment, which retreated to the vicinity of Lyduokiai, was reinforced, and the 8th Infantry Regiment was added to the Lithuanian forces at the front. The Lithuanian army started the attack in the night from November 20 to 21. Širvintos was again surrounded from the side by the forest and liberated by the Lithuanians after a short battle. During the attack in the direction of Giedraičiai, there was heavy fighting near Šiupieniai, Bekupė and Giedraičiai, where the 2nd Infantry Regiment's 3rd Battalion under Liudvikas Butkevičius distinguished itself. In the afternoon of November 21, Giedraičiai was liberated. After considerable losses, the Lithuanian army reconquered territory up to the positions it held before November 17.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\n\n\n=== Polish casualties ===\nDuring the fighting of November 17–21, the Polish material losses included a smashed armored car, 2 machine guns, about 20,000 rifle cartridges, several artillery shell carriages. At least 60 prisoners were taken, with many more Polish soldiers that became stragglers that the Lithuanians could not capture due to the fewness of their soldiers. In the vicinity of Giedraičiai, at least 30 Polish dead were counted, with many more unidentified and not explained. The number of wounded Polish soldiers is also unclear and 11 seriously wounded Polish soldier were captured by Lithuanians.\n\n\n=== Lithuanian casualties ===\nThree Lithuanian officers died in the fighting: Lieutenant Vincas Gvildys (1st Company's commander), Lieutenant Pranas Telksnys (Training Company's commander), Lieutenant Kazys Matulaitis (1st Machine Gun Company's Commander). The following officers were seriously injured: Captain E. Noreika (3rd Battalion's commander), Lieutenant J. Mačiukas (captured by Poles), Senior Lieutenant S. Musatovas (7th Company's commander), junior officer Mačiulevičius. Concerning Lithuanian soldiers, 15 were killed, about 60 wounded and about 70 were missing in action.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt the request of the Military Control Commission, hostilities ended on November 21. The Polish cavalry brigade, cut off deep in the Lithuanian rear, began to retreat hastily and, pursued by Lithuanian soldiers and partisans, crossed the front line at Labanoras on November 24. With the mediation of the League's Military Control Commission, the Lithuanian government and Żeligowski signed the Treaty of Kaunas, a cease-fire protocol, on November 29, which established the 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) wide Polish–Lithuanian Neutral Strip.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nThe site of the battle of Giedraičiai is marked and commemorated by a symbolic cannon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlišauskas, Kazys (1958). \"Lietuvos kariuomenė (1918–1944)\".

Its cast features Karra Elejalde, Anabel Alonso, Nathalie Seseña, Amparo Valle, Txema Blasco, and Maxi Rodríguez.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in a mining town in Asturias, the plot follows the family of a retired miner, Luisón Quirós. After Luisón dies in a brothel, the family members try to conceal the news and the corpse as they are economically dependent on the subsidies earned by Luisón.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Último Pase and Cartel and it had the additional participation of TVE and Vía Digital. It boasted a €1.9 million budget. It was shot in Mieres, Asturias in 2000.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film screened as the closing film of the 39th Gijón International Film Festival (FICX) in November 2001. Distributed by Lauren Film, it was released theatrically in Spain on 1 February 2002.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJonathan Holland of Variety deemed the \"delightfully oddball, bad-taste comedy with a political point\" to be \"a surprise pleasure\".\nJosé Luis Sánchez Noriega considered that despite the film falling short of being exceptional, \"Spanish film buffs will be pleased\" by the film for how \"it cultivates the literary, theatrical and filmic vein of black humor\" along the lines of Berlanga or Buñuel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2002\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ourisia remotifolia is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevation habitats in the South Island of New Zealand. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. remotifolia in 1984. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved herbs that are covered in a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. They have hairy, crenate, ovate leaves that are oppositely arranged and tightly packed along the creeping stem. The flowers are single or in pairs in each node, with a zygomorphic calyx and corolla. The corolla is white and the corolla tube is purple inside with three lines of white hairs. It is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia remotifolia Arroyo is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. remotifolia in 1984.\nThe type material was collected by Mary Kalin Arroyo at Gertrude Saddle, Fiordland National Park, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research.\nOurisia remotifolia is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, with which it shares irregular white corollas that are purple inside with lines of white hairs, and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. remotifolia can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by its lax, semi-erect, non-rosette habit (vs. erect rosette habit), leaves with long petioles that are widely spaced along the stem (vs. tightly packed rosettes), irregular calyces (vs. regular), flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls), and all hairs the same length (vs. glandular hairs much shorter than non-glandular hairs).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nOurisia remotifolia plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are tightly packed to tufted near the tip of the stem. Leaf petioles are 2.6–18.5 mm long. Leaf blades are 6.9–24.0 mm long by 6.9–20.3 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.0–1.2: 1), broadly to very broadly ovate, widest below the middle, with a rounded apex, usually cuneate base and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are densely hairy with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on the upper surface, and densely hairy with short to long glandular hairs on the lower surface especially on the veins (sometimes glabrous), with prominent veins on the lower surface and sometimes punctate. Inflorescences are erect, densely hairy racemes up to 190 mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1–4 flowering nodes and up to 6 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, sometimes clasping bracts that are narrowly obovate or oblanceolate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 9.5–17.6 mm long and 5.3–9.1 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 21 mm long and has glandular hairs. The calyx is 5.7–7.7 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to one-quarter to one-half the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 12.5–17.7mm long (including the 4.6–8.1mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside, and purple with 3 lines of white hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 3.6–9.2 mm long, spreading, and usually obcordate to obovate. There are 4 stamens up to 7.0 mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens reaching the corolla tube opening or exserted, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla; a short staminode 0.5–0.7 mm long is also present. The style is 3.0–4.9 mm long, exserted, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.2–3.1 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 3.9–6.5 mm long and 3.3–6.2 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 27.0 mm long. The number of seeds in each capsule is unknown, and seeds are 0.7–1.1 mm long and 0.3–0.6 mm long, with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia remotifolia flowers from December to January and fruits from January to April.\n\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia remotifolia is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nOurisia remotifolia is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found only in the regions of Canterbury, Westland and Fiordland in high-elevation herbfields on bluffs, in sheltered hollows, or in rock crevices, and can be locally common, from 1000 to 2200 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nAn individual of O. remotifolia was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, and in the nuclear ribosomal and combined datasets, it was moderately to strongly supported as sister to O. macrocarpa. In the combined dataset, these two species were in a clade with O. sessilifolia and O. caespitosa.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all 12 sampled individuals formed a highly supported clade that was in turn moderately supported as being near the root of the tree with O. modesta. The 12 sampled individuals of O. remotifolia also comprised one of the significant clusters in the Bayesian clustering analysis.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia remotifolia is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon, with the qualifiers Range Restricted (RR) and Sparse (Sp) in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia remotifolia at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia remotifolia occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "NGC 3509 known as Arp 335, is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. It is located 340 million light-years from the Solar System. NGC 3509 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on December 30, 1786.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nNGC 3509 is a large galaxy. With a diameter of 215,000 light-years, it is much bigger than the Milky Way, which only has a diameter of at least 100,000 thousand light-years. Its luminosity class is II-III and it has a broad HII region. \n\nAdditionally, NGC 3509 is a peculiar galaxy showing an interesting detail. It has a sweeping tidal tail feature, which seems to offer hints of evolution and makes the galaxy resemble a tadpole. A further study proves that this is not the case since NGC 3509 has a single undisturbed nucleus which is surrounded by dust lanes. This means it hasn't undergone a major disk-to-disk merger and instead had a minor merger with a smaller satellite galaxy. As the galaxy interaction between NGC 3509 and the galaxy occurs, certain starbursts are triggered  in regions along its spiral arms which causes it to actively create new stars.\nAnother study proves that a galactic halo is growing in NGC 3509 through accretion of smaller galaxies, in which they leave a spur behind as they are tidally disrupted by their host galaxy.\nNGC 3509 is designated as Arp 335 in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies by Halton Arp, in which it is placed into the Miscellaneous category, M82 being the well-known galaxy in this classification.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been discovered in NGC 3509: SN 2010bi.\n\n\n=== SN 2010bi ===\nSN 2010bi was discovered on March 24, 2010, by G. Piginata and M. Cifuentes along with other astronomers from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on the behalf of the CHASE project (CHilean Automatic Supernova sEarch). SN 2010bi was found via an unfiltered image taken using the 0.41-m 'PROMPT 5' telescope located at Cerro Tololo. It was located 28\".4 east and 34\".6 north of the nucleus. The supernova was Type IIP in which its progenitor might be a 8-16 solar mass red supergiant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Finbhennach (or Findbennach in Modern English) is a legendary white stud bull that existed during the reign of Queen Medb and King Ailill of Ulster. Mentioned in the Ulster Cycle, The bull is know for his attack against the Donn Cuailgne, known as the Cattle Raid of Cooley.\nLike the Donn Cúailnge, the Findbennach was an extremely fertile stud bull over whom the Táin Bó Cúailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) was fought.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nHe was originally a man named Rucht (meaning grunt), a pig-keeper and druid, who worked for Ochall Ochne, king of the Connaught sidh. Formerly being great friends, he fell out with Friuch (meaning bristle), who was a pig-keeper and druid for Bodb Dearg, king of the Munster sidh after a quarrel arose to figure out who was the best of them as a pig-keeper. Being highly adept at magic, they tricked each other into emaciating their herd of pigs, which proved their talent was equal. Nevertheless this infuriated both kings, which caused their dismissal. \nAfter this the two fought, transforming into various animals and other forms, ultimately becoming two eels which were swallowed by two cows and reborn as two bulls, the Finnbhennach (\"White-horned\") and the Donn Cuailnge (\"Brown bull\"). Originally the Finnbhennach was born into the herds of queen Medb of Connacht, but considered belonging to a woman beneath him and joined the herds of her husband, Ailill.\nWhen Medb discovered that owning Finnbhennach made Ailill richer than her, she resolved to even the account by possessing Donn Cuailnge in Connacht. She sent messengers to Dáire with an extremely generous offer of land and treasure, and if necessary sexual favours, if he would loan the bull to her for a year. Dáire agreed. However the messengers got drunk, and one boasted that if he hadn't agreed Medb would have taken the bull by force. When Dáire was told that he furiously backed out of the deal.\nEventually Medb arranges the attack on Daire but unbeknownst to her Cú Chulainn the Hound was defending the fort. He managed to kill all of Medb's soldiers. Medb later asked a druidess named Fedelm to prophesize the outcome. She only replied she saw crimson and red and later foretold of Cu Chulainn's victory.\nWhen Lugh helps Cu Chulainn in healing him, Cu Chulainn manages to put Medb under his mercy. She requested that he let her take her army back to her kingdom, which he grants. However, she secretly captured the Donn Cuailgne and took it back.\nAfter the Donn Cuailgne bellows loudly the Findbennach senses a challenge to its dominion in Ulster. He readily attacks and the Findbennach gains an advantage being in familiar territory; however Cormac son of Conchobar insults the Donn which gives him greater strength. At last after, fighting all night, the Donn returned victorious from killing the Finnbennach.\nHowever after scattering the Findbennach's corpse all around Ireland and after returning to Connacht, the Donn Cuailgne's heart gives in, killing him also.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Finbhennach at Wikimedia Commons",

It was founded in 1946 and is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of its regional structure Caritas Asia.\n\n\n== Background and work ==\nIn 1946, after the end of World War II in Japan, the Japanese government established a committee to receive and distribute food, clothing, and others items received by the Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA), an initiative of American welfare organisations. The Catholic Church of Japan was one of many Christian initiatives that partnered with public authorities to distributing relief items and part of this committee.\nTwo years later, in response to a letter by the Holy See on the coordination of the Catholic social programmes, the Japanese bishops decided to register the Caritas Society of Japan as an incorporate association. Its goal was to coordinate and guide the work at national level. In each diocese, a priest was appointed to be in charge of the social services provided. Caritas Japan in its current form was established in 1970.\nThe national office of Caritas Japan has five employees who coordinate the work of the 16 diocesan Caritas organisations. The organisation works with thousands of volunteers across the country.\nIn 2023, Caritas Japan funded the humanitarian relief efforts of the other members of the Caritas Internationalis confederation aronund the globe, including in South Sudan, Ukraine, Pakistan, Madagascar, Venezuela and Morocco, as well as development efforts abroad and activities implemented in Japan.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n2007-2022: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi\n2022-now: Daisuke Narui\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dobong B (Korean: 도봉구 을) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Dobong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 136,197 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1996 after being reorganized from the former Dobong B and Dobong C constituencies.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Dobong B has more often voted for centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency and is thus considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party. \nSul Hoon of the centrist-liberal National Congress for New Politics was the first member to represent the constituency, having narrowly beat out Paik Young-ki of the centre-right Grand National Party. Sul won re-election in 2000, once again defeating Paik. However, Sul did not run for re-election in 2004 after being indicted on falsely claiming that then presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang had received $200,000 from businessman Choi Kyu-sun. Sul was succeeded by Yoo Ihn-tae of the liberal Uri Party, receiving 47.37% of the vote. Yoo unsuccessfully ran for re-election in 2008 and was defeated by Kim Seon-dong of the Grand National Party. A return match between Yoo and Kim was held in 2012 which saw Yoo win back the seat. Ahead of the 2016 South Korean legislative election, the Democratic Party \"cut-off\" Yoo from re-nomination, instead nominating lawyer Oh Gi-hyoung for the constituency. Kim Seon-dong of the conservative Saenuri Party emerged victorious in a three-way race which saw vote splitting between the Democratic Party and the newly formed centrist People Party. In the following election, Oh Gi-hyoung defeated Kim by a margin of more than seven points, winning back the seat for Democratic Party. Oh won re-election in 2024, garnering 52.83% of the vote and defeated People Power Party challenger Kim Seon-dong in a one-on-one match.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Ssangmun 2-dong, Ssangmun 4-dong, Banghak-dong, and Dobong-dong. The constituency borders Uijeongbu A to the north, Dongducheon–Yangju–Yeoncheon A to the northwest, Gangbuk A to the west, Dobong A to the south, and Nowon B to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Raynald of Saint-Valéry (died after 1165), also known as Renaud, was Lord of Harenc—a fiefdom in the Principality of Antioch—from 1158 to 1163.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRaynald was the son of Bernard II of Saint-Valéry and his wife Matilda. In 1097, Raynald's father is mentioned with his father, Walter of Saint-Valéry, during the conquest of Nicaea in the First Crusade.\nAround 1157/1158, Raynald is witnessed as a knight in the retinue of Thierry, Count of Flanders. He went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land and there they took part in a military campaign against the Syrian Muslims under the leadership of Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem, in the summer of 1157. The crusaders took advantage of Nur al-Din Zengi’s illness to expand the Principality of Antioch. Certainly, Thierry had in mind to hold of the conquered lands. First, they besieged the fortress of Shaizar, which Thierry should have received as a fief.\nRaynald of Châtillon, Prince of Antioch, demanded that the new rulers should turned them into his vassals. However, Raynald only had seized the princely throne through his marriage with Constance, Princess of Antioch, the actual Antioch’s ruler, and he was a minor noble unlike Thierry, who was a high noble in France. So that, Thierry refused to make him homage as his feudal lord. Although the crusaders had taken Shaizar’s Lower Town and the Citadel was on the point of surrendering, they lifted the siege in October 1157 and the crusader army continued his march to the north.\nAfter the army had occupied the ruins of Apamea, they sieged the castle of Harenc. Harenc had belonged to the Principality of Antioch, but it was conquest by Nur al-Din’s forces in 1149. The crusader army conquered Harenc on February 1158. Since Thierry still refusing to make homage to Raynald of Châtillon, the Harenc’s castle and his surrounding domains were granted to Raynald of Saint-Valéry. As new Lord of Harenc, Raynald was engaged in another Baldwin III’s campaign, where he distinguished in Nur al-Din’s defeat, who had invaded Galilee.\nThe castle of Harenc was disputed during the next decade. On 12 August 1164, a Christian army was defeated by Nur al-Din during the battle of Harim, which was sent to relieve Harenc. Apparently, Raynald had already departed to England to that time y he sold his rights about Harenc to Joscelin III, Titular Count of Edessa, who is mentioned as Lord of Harenc around 1163. Raynald, probably had one daughter called Orguilleuse, who married with Bohemond III, Prince of Antioch and she was known as “Lord of Harenc’s daughter”.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBaldwin, Marsall W.

Shoes were distributed to the soldiers captured on the soldiers captured on the road near Sośnina Modryniecka. In new, creaking boots the unit was to set out on an operation to liquidate the Ukrainian police station in Mieniany. The assembly point was marked in the Witkowski forest, south of Zablocie, i.e. in a direction diametrically opposed to the post in Mieniany, which was situated in the north. was located to the north\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe soldiers had some doubts about choosing the right assembly point, but it turned out that the chosen forest was the one where a group of Home Army \"Pogonia\" and \"Grazyna\" was to be reunited - there were 20 of them, and other Home Army soldiers joined them on the way, some of them in Mircze forest, west of the Warezh-Hrubie road. The whole unit, from the Mircze forest, followed the tracks of the narrow-gauge railway through the Modryń colliery to Dąbrowa, where the whole unit lodged for the day without looking out of the buildings. In the meantime, a number of scouts were sent to establish details of the post in Mieniany. one of the soldiers was to say During the day, the commander - \"Ryś\" - distributed posts and tasks to each of us. I was assigned to the group storming the post. My task was, together with Jędrek Uran, set fire to the post.On 15.IX.1943 they set off at night from Dąbrowa. and then crossed the road leading to Hrubieszów and the partisans then went into the gap between the forest of Cichobórz, which, was left in the south and Masłomęcz - from the north. coll. Mieniany going to the Mieniany forest for the starting position. The same soldier told about an assault group led by commander \"Rys\" (Stanislaw Basaj), which went from the Mieniany forest along the road through the fields to the south, in order to cross the track from Cichobórz to Hrubieszów and attack the post from the south (from the meadows).A nearby person described everything would have been fine, because the action was buttoned up very late. the unit at night and hid in a nearby potato field. When the dark silhouettes approached the local Home Army men hiding in the potatoes, one of them fired his rifle (obrzynka). Shots were fired and the battle began.\nThis brief clash in the potatoes spoiled the whole action, because it warned the post of the danger. The advantage of surprising the Ukrainian policemen, decisive for our success, was lost. Bolesław Lis was severely wounded in the field. Lis. Also wounded was the acolyte who was shooting at Lis.So a straw-covered shed was set on fire. From it, the community building, also wooden, caught fire and only from the community building did the post building catch fire. Everything burned down. Before the arson, the post was fired at by \"Lynx\" with a heavy machine gun and single rifles. The policemen did not respond. After the battle it turned out that they were supposed to be hiding in a neighbouring cellar. There were supposed to be six policemen.\n\n\n== Aftermah ==\nAfter the battle, the German authorities moved the post to Chernivtsi. Lynx lost one man.\n\n\n== References ==",

The centre focuses on advancing Behavioral Science in India to enhance developmental outcomes. CSBC has set up a Behavioral Insights Unit (BIU), akin to 'Nudge Units', at the Niti Aayog, and has also set up BIUs in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. These units are instrumental in applying behavioural insights to improve public policy and program implementation.\nThe CSBC currently focuses on several key areas including nutrition, sanitation, maternal health, family planning, and financial services. Its approach to achieving its vision includes: collaborating on behaviour change programs with the Government of India and various non-governmental organisations; conducting foundational research to deepen the understanding of the needs and dynamics of poor and marginalised communities, as well as the most effective methods to reach and engage them; and enhancing capabilities by incorporating the latest developments in behavioural science, design thinking, data science, and implementation science to create more effective interventions.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2011, at the age of 16, Luis was invited by Jaine Hernandez to join the Cuban national team. As the youngest member, Patterson placed first in the 2015 El Salvador junior world cup in individual men's épée.\nPatterson was recognized as one of the top Cuban athletes leading up to the 2019 Pan American games. At the XVIII Pan American Games held in Lima, Peru, Patterson and the Cuban team secured first place in men's team épée. Subsequently, in Toronto, Canada, they again placed first in men's team épée, aiming to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\nHowever, prior to the Cuban épée team's participation in the 2019 Bern Switzerland World Cup, Patterson made the decision to leave Cuba instead of competing. Upon arriving in Bern, he continued on to Vancouver, Canada, seeking a fresh start and the opportunity to continue his fencing career.\nIn Vancouver, Patterson continues his fencing career as head épée coach at Antaean fencing club, working with Canadian athletes. Luis was able to obtain Jamaican citizenship through his mother's roots, and now competes for the Jamaican national team in individual men's épée.\n\n\n=== Pan American Games ===\n\n\n=== Junior World Cup ===\n\n\n=== National Championship ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Morris Alexander (1877 – 1946) was a South African Jewish politician. Morris was born in 1877 in Znin, Poland to a German Jewish family. He moved to Cape Town in 1904. He founded the Jewish Board of Deputies for the Cape Colony in that same year. Morris would be educated at St. John's College in Cambridge. He would marry a woman named Ruth Schechter in June 1907. They would have three children but divorced in 1935. He would later remarry Enid Asenath Baumberg. He would be a member of the Cape of Good Hope Parliament from 1908 to 1910 and later a member of the Union of South Africa Parliament from 1910 until his death in 1946.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn to a German Jewish family in 1877, Morris would move to South Africa in 1904 at the age of 17. He would be educated at St. Johns University. Morris Alexander would be married to Ruth Shechter, the daughter of Solomon Shechter in June 1907. They would have two sons and one daughter before they divorced in 1935. He would remarry a woman named Enid Asenath Baumberg.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nMorris would first get into politics in 1904 when he founded the Cape Jewish Board of Deputies which dealt with issues of Jewish immigration to the Cape of Good Hope. From 1908 to 1910 Morris was elected to the Cape of Good Hope Parliament. \nDuring this time he would lead a campaign to have Yiddish reclassified from a Semitic language to a European one allowing Yiddish speakers to emigrate to South Africa without being stopped on the grounds of race. Prior to this many Jewish immigrants to South Africa where rejected on racial grounds. During this time he and his wife would both become staunch supporters of Gandhi as they both were united over their support for Yiddish speakers.\nHe later suggested that a chief officer of Jewish immigration be appointed and on January 1, 1914, Mr. B.S. Hersch was appointed to that role. This would be significant as after World War I many Jews immigrated to South Africa. In his later career he would work for the interests of the country's racial minorities, join the South African Party and become a devotee of the ideas of Jan Smuts, and would become a significant Jewish community leader.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A hazard is a potential source of harm. Substances, events, or circumstances can constitute hazards when their nature would allow them to cause damage to health, life, property, or any other interest of value. The probability of that harm being realized in a specific incident, combined with the magnitude of potential harm, make up its risk. This term is often used synonymously in colloquial speech.\nHazards can be classified in several ways which are not mutually exclusive. They can be classified by causing actor (natural, anthropogenic), by type of mechanism (biological, chemical, or physical hazard) or by effect (for example health and safety hazard, fire hazard, or environmental hazard). A common theme across many forms of hazards in the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. The stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal hazards and by the populations that may be affected and the severity of the associated risk. \nFor example, a natural hazard event can lead to a natural disaster with highly harmful impact on a society. Some examples of natural hazard events include floods, droughts, earthquakes, tropical cyclones, lightning strikes,volcanic activity, wildfires. Technological and anthropogenic hazards include for example explosions, the release of toxic materials, structural collapses, and transportation accidents.\n\nThe term climate hazard is used in the context of climate change. These are hazards that stem from climate-related events such as wildfires, floods, droughts, sea level rise.: 1181  Climate hazards can combine with other hazards and result in compound event losses (see also loss and damage). For example, the climate hazard of heat can combine with the hazard of poor air quality. Or the climate hazard flooding can combine with poor water quality.: 909 \n\n\n== Definition ==\nA hazard is defined as \"the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources.\": 2233 \nA hazard only exists if there is a pathway to exposure. As an example, the center of the Earth consists of molten material at very high temperatures which would be a severe hazard if contact was made with the core. However, there is no feasible way of making contact with the core, therefore the center of the Earth currently poses no hazard.\nThe frequency and severity of hazards are important aspects for risk management. Hazards may also be assessed in relation to the impact that they have. \nIn defining hazard Keith Smith argues that what may be defined as the hazard is only a hazard if there is the presence of humans to make it a hazard. In this regard, human sensitivity to environmental hazards is a combination of both physical exposure (natural and/or technological events at a location related to their statistical variability) and human vulnerability (about social and economic tolerance of the same location).\n\n\n== Relationship with other terms ==\n\n\n=== Disaster ===\n\nAn example of the distinction between a natural hazard and a disaster is that an earthquake is the hazard which caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake disaster.\nA natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. The term \"disaster\" itself is defined as follows: \"Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity to cope using its own resources. Disasters can be caused by natural, man-made and technological hazards, as well as various factors that influence the exposure and vulnerability of a community.\"\nThe US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) explains the relationship between natural disasters and natural hazards as follows: \"Natural hazards and natural disasters are related but are not the same. A natural hazard is the threat of an event that will likely have a negative impact. A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community. \nDisaster can take various forms, including hurricane, volcano, tsunami, earthquake, drought, famine, plague, disease, rail crash, car crash, tornado, deforestation, flooding, toxic release, and spills (oil, chemicals). \nA disaster hazard is an extreme geophysical event that is capable of causing a disaster. 'Extreme' in this case means a substantial variation in either the positive or the negative direction from the normal trend; flood disasters can result from exceptionally high precipitation and river discharge, and drought is caused by exceptionally low values. The fundamental determinants of hazard and the risk of such hazards occurring is timing, location, magnitude and frequency. For example, magnitudes of earthquakes are measured on the Richter scale from 1 to 10, whereby each increment of 1 indicates a tenfold increase in severity. The magnitude-frequency rule states that over a significant period of time many small events and a few large ones will occur. Hurricanes and typhoons on the other hand occur between 5 degrees and 25 degrees north and south of the equator, tending to be seasonal phenomena that are thus largely recurrent in time and predictable in location due to the specific climate variables necessary for their formation.\n\n\n=== Risk and vulnerability ===\n\nThe terms hazard and risk are often used interchangeably. However, in terms of risk assessment, these are two very distinct terms. A hazard is an agent that can cause harm or damage to humans, property, or the environment. Risk is the probability that exposure to a hazard will lead to a negative consequence, or more simply, a hazard poses no risk if there is no exposure to that hazard.\nRisk is a combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. For example in terms of water security: examples of hazards are droughts, floods and decline in water quality. Bad infrastructure and bad governance lead to high exposure to risk.\nRisk can be defined as the likelihood or probability of a given hazard of a given level causing a particular level of loss of damage. The elements of risk are populations, communities, the built environment, the natural environment, economic activities and services which are under threat of disaster in a given area. \nAnother definition of risk is \"the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future losses\". This definition also focuses on the probability of future loss whereby the degree of vulnerability to hazard represents the level of risk on a particular population or environment. The threats posed by a hazard are:\n\nHazards to people – death, injury, disease and stress\nHazards to goods – property damage and economic loss\nHazards to environment –loss of flora and fauna, pollution and loss of amenity\n\n\n== Classifications ==\nHazards can be classified in several ways. These categories are not mutually exclusive which means that one hazard can fall into several categories. For example, water pollution with toxic chemicals is an anthropogenic hazard as well as an environmental hazard.  \nOne of the classification methods is by specifying the origin of the hazard. One key concept in identifying a hazard is the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. The stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal, radioactive, electrical, etc. \nThe United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) explains that \"each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity or magnitude, frequency and probability\".\nA distinction can also be made between rapid-onset natural hazards, technological hazards, and social hazards, which are described as being of sudden occurrence and relatively short duration, and the consequences of longer-term environmental degradation such as desertification and drought.\nHazards may be grouped according to their characteristics.  These factors are related to geophysical events, which are not process specific:\n\nAreal extent of damage zone\nIntensity of impact at a point\nDuration of impact at a point\nRate of onset of the event\nPredictability of the event\n\n\n== By causing actor ==\n\n\n=== Natural hazard ===\n\nNatural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and tsunami have threatened people, society, the natural environment, and the built environment, particularly more vulnerable people, throughout history, and in some cases, on a day-to-day basis. According to the Red Cross, each year 130,000 people are killed, 90,000 are injured and 140 million are affected by unique events known as natural disasters.\nGeological hazards, meteorological or extreme weather-related hazards, hydrological hazards and biological hazards are some categories of natural hazards.\nNatural hazards can be amplified by anthropogenic processes, e.g. land-use change, drainage and construction.\nHumans play a central role in the existence of natural hazards because \"it is only when people and their possessions get in the way of natural processes that hazard exists\". \nA natural hazard can be considered as a geophysical event when it occurs in extremes and a human factor is involved that may present a risk. There may be an acceptable variation of magnitude which can vary from the estimated normal or average range with upper and lower limits or thresholds. In these extremes, the natural occurrence may become an event that presents a risk to the environment or people. For example, above-average wind speeds resulting in a tropical depression or hurricane according to intensity measures on the Saffir–Simpson scale will provide an extreme natural event that may be considered a hazard.\n\n\n==== Seismic hazard ====\nTsunamis are a geophysical hazards. For example, a tsunami struck in 2004 in Sri Lanka and 1,700 people died in the Sri Lanka tsunami-rail disaster.\n\n\n==== Volcanic hazard ====\n\n\n=== Anthropogenic hazard ===\nAnthropogenic hazards, or human-induced hazards, are \"induced entirely or predominantly by human activities and choices\". These can be grouped into sociological hazards, technological hazards and environmental hazards. Sociological hazards include for example for example war, terrorism, crime, civil disorder, riots. Technological hazards include for example industrial hazards, power outage, fire, nuclear accidents. \nHowever, the definition by UNDRR excludes \"armed conflicts and other situations of social instability\" from the anthropogenic hazard category.\n\n\n=== Socionatural hazard ===\nThere are different ways to group hazards by origin. The definition by UNDRR states: \"Hazards may be natural, anthropogenic or socionatural in origin.\" The socionatural hazards are those that are \"associated with a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, including environmental degradation and climate change\".\n\n\n== By type of mechanism ==\n\n\n=== Biological hazard ===\n\nBiological hazards, also known as biohazards, originate in biological processes of living organisms and refer to agents that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, the security of property, or the health of the environment. Biological hazards include viruses, parasites, bacteria, food, fungi, and foreign toxins. These can sometimes cause diseases in people through infection. For example, naturally occurring bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella are well known pathogens, and a variety of measures have been taken to limit human exposure to these microorganisms through food safety, good personal hygiene, and education. However, the potential for new biological hazards exists through the discovery of new microorganisms and the development of new genetically modified (GM) organisms. The use of new GM organisms is regulated by various governmental agencies. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) controls GM plants that produce or resist pesticides (i.e. Bt corn and Roundup ready crops). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates GM plants that will be used as food or for medicinal purposes.\nBiological hazards can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect health. Many biological hazards are associated with food, including certain viruses, parasites, fungi, bacteria, and plant and seafood toxins. Pathogenic Campylobacter and Salmonella are common foodborne biological hazards. The hazards from these bacteria can be avoided through risk mitigation steps such as proper handling, storing, and cooking of food. Diseases can be enhanced by human factors such as poor sanitation or by processes such as urbanization.\n\n\n=== Chemical hazard ===\n\nA chemical can be considered a hazard if by its intrinsic properties it can cause harm or danger to humans, property, or the environment. Health hazards associated with chemicals are dependent on the dose or amount of the chemical. For example, iodine in the form of potassium iodate is used to produce iodised salt. When applied at a rate of 20  mg of potassium iodate per 1000 mg of table salt, the chemical is beneficial in preventing goitre, while iodine intakes of 1200–9500  mg in one dose has been known to cause death. Some chemicals have a cumulative biological effect, while others are metabolically eliminated over time. Other chemical hazards may depend on concentration or total quantity for their effects.\nSome harmful chemicals occur naturally in certain geological formations, such as radon gas or arsenic. Other chemicals include products with commercial uses, such as agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as products developed for home use.  \n\n\n==== Hazardous materials ====\n\nA variety of chemical hazards have been identified. However, every year companies produce more new chemicals to fill new needs or to take the place of older, less effective chemicals. Laws, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act in the US, require protection of human health and the environment for any new chemical introduced. In the US, the EPA regulates new chemicals that may have environmental impacts (i.e., pesticides or chemicals released during a manufacturing process), while the FDA regulates new chemicals used in foods or as drugs. The potential hazards of these chemicals can be identified by performing a variety of tests before the authorization of usage. The number of tests required and the extent to which the chemicals are tested varies, depending on the desired usage of the chemical. Chemicals designed as new drugs must undergo more rigorous tests than those used as pesticides.\nPesticides, which are normally used to control unwanted insects and plants, may cause a variety of negative effects on non-target organisms. DDT can build up, or bioaccumulate, in birds, resulting in thinner-than-normal eggshells, which can break in the nest. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin has been linked to Parkinson's disease. Corrosive chemicals like sulfuric acid, which is found in car batteries and research laboratories, can cause severe skin burns. Many other chemicals used in industrial and laboratory settings can cause respiratory, digestive, or nervous system problems if they are inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. The negative effects of other chemicals, such as alcohol and nicotine, have been well documented.\nOrganohalogens are a family of synthetic organic molecules which all contain atoms of one of the halogens. Such materials include PCBs, Dioxins, DDT, Freon and many others. Although considered harmless when first produced, many of these compounds are now known to have profound physiological effects on many organisms including man. Many are also fat soluble and become concentrated through the food chain.\nRadioactive materials produce ionizing radiation which may be very harmful to living organisms. Damage from even a short exposure to radioactivity may have long term adverse health consequences.\n\n\n=== Physical hazard ===\n\n\n== By effects ==\n\n\n=== Health and safety hazard ===\nHazards that would affect the health of exposed persons, usually having an acute or chronic illness as the consequence. Fatality would not normally be an immediate consequence. Health hazards may cause measurable changes in the body which are generally indicated by the development of signs and symptoms in the exposed persons, or non-measurable, subjective symptoms.\n\n\n==== Ergonomic hazard ====\n\nErgonomic hazards are physical conditions that may pose a risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system, such as the muscles or ligaments of the lower back, tendons or nerves of the hands/wrists, or bones surrounding the knees.  Ergonomic hazards include things such as awkward or extreme postures, whole-body or hand/arm vibration, poorly designed tools, equipment, or workstations, repetitive motion, and poor lighting.  Ergonomic hazards occur in both occupational and non-occupational settings such as in workshops, building sites, offices, home, school, or public spaces and facilities.\n\n\n==== Occupational hazard ====\n\n\n==== Psychosocial hazard ====\n\nPsychological or psychosocial hazards are hazards that affect the psychological well-being of people, including their ability to participate in a work environment among other people. Psychosocial hazards are related to the way work is designed, organized, and managed, as well as the economic and social contexts of work, and are associated with psychiatric, psychological, and/or physical injury or illness. Linked to psychosocial risks are issues such as occupational stress and workplace violence, which are recognized internationally as major challenges to occupational health and safety.\n\n\n==== Societal hazard ====\nThere are certain societal hazards that can occur by inadvertently overlooking a hazard, a failure to notice or by purposeful intent by human inaction or neglect, consequences as a result of little or no preemptive actions to prevent a hazard from occurring. Although not everything is within the scope of human control, there is anti-social behaviour and crimes committed by individuals or groups that can be prevented by reasonable apprehension of injury or death. People commonly report dangerous circumstances, suspicious behaviour or criminal intentions to the police and for the authorities to investigate or intervene.\n\n\n=== Mechanical or engineering hazard ===\nA mechanical hazard is any hazard involving a machine or industrial process. Motor vehicles, aircraft, and air bags pose mechanical hazards. Compressed gases or liquids can also be considered a mechanical hazard. Hazard identification of new machines and/or industrial processes occurs at various stages in the design of the new machine or process. These hazard identification studies focus mainly on deviations from the intended use or design and the harm that may occur as a result of these deviations. These studies are regulated by various agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nEngineering hazards occur when structures used by people fail or the materials used in their construction prove to be hazardous.\n\n\n=== Fire hazard ===\n\nThreats to fire safety are commonly referred to as fire hazards. A fire hazard may include a situation that increases the likelihood of a fire or may impede escape in the event a fire occurs.\nCasualties resulting from fires, regardless of their source or initial cause, can be aggravated by inadequate emergency preparedness. Such hazards as a lack of accessible emergency exits, poorly marked escape routes, or improperly maintained fire extinguishers or sprinkler systems may result in many more deaths and injuries than might occur with such protections.\n\n\n=== Environmental hazard ===\n\n\n==== Waste disposal ====\nIn managing waste many hazardous materials are put in the domestic and commercial waste stream. In part this is because modern technological living uses certain toxic or poisonous materials in the electronics and chemical industries. Which, when they are in use or transported, are usually safely contained or encapsulated and packaged to avoid any exposure. In the waste stream, the waste products exterior or encapsulation breaks or degrades and there is a release and exposure to hazardous materials into the environment, for people working in the waste disposal industry, those living around sites used for waste disposal or landfill and the general environment surrounding such sites.\n\n\n=== Climate hazard ===\n\nThe term climate hazard or climatic hazard is used in the context of climate change, for example in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. These are hazards that stem from climate-related events such as wildfires, floods, droughts, sea level rise.: 1181  \nClimate hazards in the context of water include: Increased temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns between the wet and dry season (increased rainfall variability) and sea level rise.: 620  The reason why increasing temperatures is listed here as a climate hazard is because \"warming temperatures may result in higher evapotranspiration, in turn leading to drier soils\".: 663  \nWaterborne diseases are also connected to climate hazards.: 1065 \nClimate hazards can combine with other hazards and result in compound event losses (see also loss and damage). For example, the climate hazard of heat can combine with the hazard of poor air quality. Or the climate hazard flooding can combine with poor water quality.: 909  \nClimate scientists have pointed out that climate hazards affect different groups of people differently, depending on their climate change vulnerability: There are \"factors that make people and groups vulnerable (e.g., poverty, uneven power structures, disadvantage and discrimination due to, for example, social location and the intersectionality or the overlapping and compounding risks from ethnicity or racial discrimination, gender, age, or disability, etc.)\".: 1181 \n\n\n== By status ==\nHazards are sometimes classified into three modes or statuses:\n\n Dormant—The situation environment is currently affected.  For instance, a hillside may be unstable, with the potential for a landslide, but there is nothing below or on the hillside that could be affected.\n Armed—People, property, or environment are in potential harm's way.\n Active—A harmful incident involving the hazard has actually occurred.  Often this is referred to not as an \"active hazard\" but as an accident, emergency, incident, or disaster.\n\n\n== Analysis and management ==\n\nA range of methodologies are used to assess hazards and to manage them:\n\nHazard analysis – Hazard Analysis explained with simple examples\nHazard analysis and critical control points – Systematic preventive approach to food safety (HACCP)\nHazard and operability study – Study of risks in a plan or operation (HAZOP)\nHierarchy of hazard controls – System used in industry to eliminate or minimize exposure to hazards\n\n\n=== Hazard symbol ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nMoral hazard – Increases in the exposure to risk when insured, or when another bears the cost\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hazards at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Dir campaign refers to a conflict that took place in Dir state, originally an insurrection by locals against the rule of Nawab Jahan Khan that lead to the death of 200 soldiers of Nawab and unknown number of locals. This insurrection antagonized Pakistani government and it tried to negotiate the resignation of Nawab but no settlement was reached. This was followed by an invasion of the state by Pakistani SSG and overthrow of Nawab. It was the first deployment of SSG in a conflict.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 8 Feb 1948, Dir acceded to the newly created Muslim dominion of Pakistan, initially continuing as one of the surviving princely states of Pakistan. \nThe politics of the late Nawabs are described as reactionary and harsh.\n\n\n== State violence and underdevelopment ==\nIt was reported by Fosco Maraini in 1959 during an expedition towards Hindu-Kush, reported the opinion of the people that the Nawab Jahan Khan (who was about 64 years old at that time) was a tyrannical leader, denying his subjects any freedom of speech and instruction, governing the land with a number of henchmen, and seizing for his harem any girl or woman he wanted. Maraini also noticed the lack of schools, sewers, and paved roads, and the presence of just a rudimentary newly built hospital. The Nawab was negatively compared to the Wali of Swat, whose liberal politics allowed his state to enter into the modern era.\n\n\n== Civilian uprising ==\nAs a consequence, uprisings began eventually to explode. A repressed revolt in 1959 was  reported by Maraini's. Another insurrection in 1960 led to the death of 200 soldiers and put the Nawab in a bad light in the view of the press. Pakistani government put heavy pressure on the Nawab Jahan Khan to resign but no diplomatic success was reached.\n\n\n== Afghan infiltration ==\nIn September 1960, Afghan tribesmen and some regular troops under civilian cover entered the area of Dir as part of the wider Bajaur Campaign to help Nawab Jahan khan against the Pakistan -backed opposition. The Afghan lashkars were forced to withdraw and this proved to be the casus belli for the Pakistani government to launch the operation for the overthrow of Nawab.\n\n\n== Pakistan military operation ==\nIn October 1960, Two companies of the SSG covertly in Scouts uniform launched an operation to overthrow the Nawab Jahan Khan and his son Khan of Jandool.\nFirst SSG company operated from Chitral under the command of Mirza Aslam Beg Commanded SSG alongside Shariff  Force commanded by Brig M. Shariff. They launched an assault on the town of Dir with the aim of overthinking Nawab Jahan Khan. Maj. Nishat Ahmed, Capt. S.M. Naeem and Lt. Fakhre Alam also participated in this operation. The overthrow was bloodless.\nThe  second SSG company, commanded by Maj. Aslam Beg, operated in the area of Munda Killa alongside Rakhman Gul Force . It's aim was to capture Khan of Jandool. Lt Col. A O Mitha were part of this company. They transported the Nawab and his son in to Risalpur via air.\nAll the weapons of nawab were confiscated and constitutional government was established. Nawab shah Khesrao khan was recognised as the Nawab of Dir. The SSG personnel remained in the area for a month.\n\n\n== Exile of Nawab ==\nGeneral Yahya decided to exile Jahan Khan, who would die in 1968. His throne passed in October 1961 to his eldest son, Mohammad Shah Khosru Khan, educated in India and a serving Major General of the Pakistan Army. However, the effective rule of Dir was taken by the Pakistani government's Political Agent.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA few years later, on 28 July 1969, the Dir state was incorporated into Pakistan, ceasing its political existence. The royal status of the Nawabs was abolished in 1972, at the same time as most other princes of Pakistan.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a poem made up of many short ones, so to speak, which differ from each other in measure, sentiment, and imagery.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arabin is a family name originating in Provence in the south of France, as d'Arabin or D’Arabien.\nBartholomew (or Barthélemy) d'Arabin fled France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He settled in Ireland, where his descendants remained until the mid-19th century. \nOther members of the Arabin family settled in Germany, where their descendants still live. In the 19th century many of the Irish and British Arabins moved to Australia.\n\n\n== French ancestry ==\nTwo sons of Jean Arabin, an innkeeper in the small town of Corps - Laurent (known as \"Captain Arabin\") and Salomon (known as \"Captain Roure\") - distinguished themselves fighting on the Protestant side in the  16th-century wars of religion in Provence.  A third brother, Barthélemy, was probably the grandfather of Jean, a prosperous draper at Riez in the present-day Alpes-de-Haute region of Provence and father of the later Barthélemy.\n\n\n== Barthélemy d'Arabin ==\nBartholomew (or Barthélemy) d'Arabin de Barcelles (d. 20/1/1712 or 1713) fled to Switzerland and then the Netherlands after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685.\nBarthélemy enrolled in the Duke of Schomberg's cavalry regiment and came to England with King William III in 1688. He fought at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland, 1690, where the Duke of Schomberg was killed. Barthélemy then served under the Marquis of Ruvigny (created Earl of Galway by William III) in Flanders (1692–97) and in Piedmont, Italy, where he was aide-de-camp to Ruvigny.\nIn 1699 his regiment was disbanded and on 15 July 1699, at St Andrew's Church, Dublin, he married Jeanne Renée de St-Julien, a daughter of Pierre St-Julien de Malacare, another Huguenot refugee and former Lord of Malacaré, near Bordeaux, and Vitré in Brittany. Bartholomew was associated with the Huguenot settlement of 1694 in Portarlington, County Laois.\n\n\n== Irish and British Arabins ==\nColonel John (or Jean) Arabin, (1703-1757), son of Bartholomew, raised the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War. He died in Gibraltar, where he was one of the officers of the garrison; there is a memorial plaque to him in the King's Chapel there. Father of William John Arabin.\nJohn Arabin (1727-1758), attended Trinity College Dublin, after which he followed his father and grandfather into the army, captain in the 14th Irish Dragoons in 1751.\nJohn Daniell Arabin (1757-1838), son of the above, was an officer in the Royal Irish Artillery, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-General.\nGeneral William John Arabin (1750-1828), Colonel John Arabin’s youngest son, Colonel of the 2nd Life Guards, father of William St Julien Arabin (see below).\nWilliam St Julien Arabin (1773-1841), was a British lawyer and judge.\nHenry Arabin (1751 or 1752-1841), a prominent Dublin lawyer, landowner and political activist, ran the Corkagh gunpowder mills in the Clondalkin district. He was a close associate of Daniel O'Connell and author of pamphlets om political and economic subjects.\nRear-Admiral Septimius Arabin, R.N. (1785-1855), son of Henry, who enjoyed a distinguished naval career during the Napoleonic Wars. He was closely associated with Admiral Sir Sidney Smith and died in Nice, France, where he unsuccessfully tried to recover the family's lost estates in Provence.\nLt.-Colonel Frederick Arabin (1786-1843), an officer in the Royal Artillery, married Elizabeth, a daughter of Jacob Mountain, first Anglican Bishop of Quebec. He served in the West Indies and Peninsula campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars and in garrisons at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Corfu and (as commanding officer) Bermuda, where he died of yellow fever.\nJohn Ladeveze Arabin (1794-1863), the youngest of Henry and Ann Arabin’s nine sons, became Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1845.\nThe surname \"Arabin\" was borrowed by Anthony Trollope for one of the main characters in his novel Barchester Towers, the Rev. Francis Arabin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ship Cafe was a landmark of Venice, California, United States, from 1903 to 1946. Built along the Venice Pier over the water off Windward Avenue, the restaurant and event space was known for its sumptuous food and prestigious clientele.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstructed by Abbot Kinney beginning in 1903, the restaurant was designed to be a feature of the resort town of Venice. The restaurant sat on pilings, and was designed by Norman Foote March and Clarence H. Russell to be an approximation of the San Salvador, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo's \"Spanish galleon\". As a tourist guide put it, \"It was his thought to moor by the sea-wall this white caravel, to fit it with anchor lamps and nautical furnishings and to place on the deck musicians in 16th-century capes and the hats of the Spanish minstrel.\" The restaurant opened in August 1904 under the management of Carlos Marchetti. According to a 1913 report, there was seating for 475 on two decks, as well as rooms for private parties. The upper dining room displayed relics from the shipwreck Santa Rosa. The kitchen drew upon fresh seafood, including halibut, bass, and sand dabs, held in a giant tank under the pier. At one time the chef paid local kids five cents a pound to dig up cockles from the Del Rey Lagoon. According to a 1916 article in Photoplay, \"The Ship with its light-dotted masts towering high above the crowds on the Windward Avenue pier is one of the landmarks of California's Great White Way. Aboard the Ship the nautical illusion is made complete by the ship's bell upon which is struck the time in sea-fashion. Dancing always ceases at two bells of the mid-watch.\" According to the Los Angeles Herald, food prices increased at the Ship Cafe after Prohibition kicked in, to compensate for lower revenue compared \"olden days [when] the Ship cafe was astounding by reason of the amount of liquor dispensed across its table\". Apparently the building's \"hotel rooms and private salons\" allowed for illegal drinking during Prohibition served by \"waiters dressed like 16th-century naval officers\".\nThe original structure burned in the 1920 Abbot Kinney Pier fire, and was rebuilt the following year as a larger copy on the same plan, at an estimated cost of $40,000. The new Ship Cafe opened June 28, 1921. The second ship had two masts, rather than the original three. The ship had a \"Spirit of the Seas\" figurehead carved by O. S. Sarsi with contest winner Jacqueline Faust as the model. The rebuilt structure was oriented north-south, whereas the original was oriented east-west. In 1922 the owners were said to be $100,000 in debt and the Los Angeles Board of Trade would be taking control of the restaurant. One visitor recalled that the interior of the rebuilt ship \"was all lovely mahogany\". The second version of the Ship Cafe survived until 1946 when the Venice pier complex was sold off and demolished.\n\n\n== Clientele ==\n\nDescribed in one history as \"the glamor spot of the Los Angeles area, a stamping ground of Hollywood stars and directors when they were relaxing,\" the Ship Cafe was also famous as a nightclub hosting musical acts and dancing girls. For instance, during the Baron Long era, \"Spanish dancers Addison Fowler and Ethyle Stewart, dubbed the 'Castles of the Coast' in comparison with ballroom dancers Vernon and Irene Castle, had a fifty week run at the Ship Cafe in 1918.\" The Ship Cafe was the site of a 1928 shootout between two Los Angeles underworld figures, Albert Marco and Dominic Conterno. Movie cowboys Tom Mix and Art Acord supposedly \"wrecked\" the restaurant once because \"they were sore at each other\". Disgruntled actors once threw dinner rolls at controversial director and fellow Ship Cafe patron Erich von Stroheim. Other notable patrons included actors Fatty Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplin, Doug Fairbanks, and Nat Goodwin, and boxers Jack Dempsey and Jim Jeffries. The Ship Cafe was said to be a second home for Buster Keaton's circle of Hollywood friends.\n\n\n== Management ==\n\nThe Ship Cafe was owned and operated by series of restauranteurs and businessmen over its 40-plus year history including Marchetti, Tom McFadden and Jim Morjey, Baron Long, Tommy Jacobs, and Carleton Kinney, a son of the founder. \n\nWard McFadden – 1910 to 1913\nRudy Fishbeck – 1913 to 1914\nCharles Shaw, Julius Miller, and John H. Gagliardo – from 1914\nBaron Long, Paul Schecnk, and Julius Rosenfeld – 1917 to 1920\nJ. M. Covington – Covington's Ship Cafe 1920 – 1922\nPeter Murich and George A.

She is the 2023 Canadian 400 m champion and represented Canada at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, finishing fourth as part of Canada's 4 × 400 m relay team.\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\n\n\n=== Trinity Western University ===\nHailing from Edmonton, Alberta, Konrad competed for the Trinity Western Spartans track and field team from 2017 to 2022, competing primarily in the 300 m. She won the 2019 and 2020 Canada West 300 m title and placed fifth at the 2019 USPORTS Championships in the 300 m, following that performance with a fourth-place finish in 2020 in a personal best of 38.93.\nIn 2022, she defended her Can West 300 m title and contested her final USPORTS Track and Field Championships, competing in the 300 m as well as the 600 m and 4 × 200 m relay. She would go on to place second in both the 300 and 600 m, and earn a bronze medal alongside her TWU teammates in the 4 × 200 m relay.\nIn August 2022, Konrad set a personal best of 53.28 to win the 400 m at the Canada Summer Games. Representing Team Alberta, she also contested the 4 × 100 and 4 × 400 m relays, placing second in both.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nIn 2023, she set successive 400 m personal bests of 52.59 and 51.96 in Calgary and then in Guelph. At the Canadian Championships, Konrad won her first national title, running 52.06 to beat out defending champion Aiyanna Stiverne and reigning silver medalist Lauren Gale.\nShe was then selected to represent Canada in both the individual 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. In the 400 m, she ran a personal best of 51.60 in her heat, but it was not enough to advance her to the semi-finals. In the relay, she anchored Canada's women's 4 × 400 team, composed of Aiyanna Stiverne, Zoe Sherar, and Kyra Constantine to a third consecutive fourth-place finish at a major championship, following Canada's performances in Tokyo and Eugene.\nIn fall 2023, Konrad competed at the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, placing fourth in 52.10, just 0.15 seconds out of a medal.\n\n\n== Championship results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kashiwa Campus, University of Tokyo (Japanese: 東京大学 柏地区キャンパス, branded as UTokyo Kashiwa) is one of the three main campuses of the University of Tokyo located in Kashiwa, Chiba. It is also referred to as the \"Kashiwa Campus\" or simply \"Kashiwa District\". It consists of three subareas divided by parks and roads: Kashiwa, Kashiwa II, and Kashiwanoha Station Front.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nUntil the 1990s, the University of Tokyo operated campuses dispersed across various locations such as Nakano, Shirokanedai, and Mitaka (later spun off from the university as the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan), as well as Roppongi (Institute for Solid State Physics, Institute of Industrial Science) and Tanashi (Institute for Nuclear Study, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research), in addition to the central Tokyo main campuses of Hongo and Komaba. These smaller campuses were acquired at different stages throughout the university's history. It was often pointed out that having smaller campuses spread across Tokyo caused various inconveniences. Hence, it was decided to purchase a hundred acres of suburban land near the newly opened Tsukuba Express line to concentrate institutes and departments that need large research facilities. UTokyo Kashiwa was established based on the tri-polar structure concept (三極構造構想), which was formulated in conjunction with the redevelopment of the Hongo and Komaba campuses, which had become too small for new buildings needed to keep up with the latest developments in science and technology.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1979, the site of the campus was occupied by the Kashiwa Communications Station of the United States Air Force (Camp Tomlinson). After the closure of the station, the site remained unoccupied until the university purchased it in 1995 and 1998.\nAs of May 2023, 1,969 postgraduate students, 819 faculty members and researchers and 831 other members of staff were based at UTokyo Kashiwa. Very few undergraduates are based at UTokyo Kashiwa, as it is dedicated to advanced research and postgraduate education. UTokyo Kashiwa also has international dormitories, reflecting its high concentration of international students.\n\n\n== Faculties and institutes ==\nUTokyo Kashiwa has the following faculties and institutes:\nFaculties and Departments:\n\nSome departments from the School of Science\nSome departments from the School of Engineering\nSome departments from the Department of New Interdisciplinary Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences\nAffiliated Institutes:\n\nKavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe\nInstitute for Cosmic Ray Research\nInstitute for Solid State Physics\nInstitute of Atmospheric and Oceanic Research\nChiba Experimental Station, Institute of Industrial Science\nCentre for Artificial Intelligence Research\nCentre for Spatial Information Science\nEnvironmental Safety Research Centre (Kashiwa Branch)\nHealth Centre (Kashiwa Branch)\nKashiwa Library\nKashiwa Area Administration Office\n\n\n== Access ==\n13 minutes by University Commuter Bus from Kashiwanoha-campus Station (TX13) on the Tsukuba Express\n30 minutes by walk from Edogawadai Station (TD20) on the Tobu Noda line\n1 hour 15 minutes by the Gorokuro Liner (shuttle bus service between the main Hongo Campus and the Kashiwa Campus)\n\n\n== Neighbourhood ==\nKashiwanoha Park\nNational Cancer Center Japan, Hospital East\nKashiwanoha Campus, Chiba University\nRugby School Japan\nLaLaport KASHIWANOHA (ららぽーと柏の葉)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The Republic of Iraq and the Kingdom of Eswatini are two other nations to which the high commission holds accreditation.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs a consequence of better ties between the two countries, Brunei established a government agency office in Kuala Lumpur in January 1982, concurrently with the establishment of a representative office in Bandar Seri Begawan by the Malaysian government. The announcement made by Brunei in September 1982 that it had extended diplomatic rights and immunities to the Malaysian Government Agency representative was warmly welcomed in the diplomatic community.\nThe Sultan declared in October 1982 that the Malaysian Government Agency will be promoted to Commissioner rank by the government. In January 1984, diplomatic ties were established between Malaysia and Brunei. On 12 August 1992, Brunei established a resident high commission in India, which was led by an acting high commissioner. The high commissioner of Brunei to Malaysia was previously accredited to India. Brunei maintains consulate-generals in Kuching and Kota Kinabalu, in addition to a high commission in Putrajaya.\n\n\n== List of ambassadors ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBrunei–Malaysia relations\n\n\n== References ==",

The main purpose of establishing the CSC is to educate Hong Kong civil servants to understand the \"Chinese Constitution\", \"Hong Kong National Security Law\", \"Hong Kong Basic Law\" and the spirit of \"One country, two systems\", to ensure that civil servants are patriots who govern Hong Kong. The final goal is to implement the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s spirit of \"patriots governing Hong Kong\" pointed out by CCP general secretary Xi Jinping.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Civil Service Bureau (CSB) originally had a Civil Service Training & Development Institute (CSTDI), which was responsible for civil servant training. Chief Executive Carrie Lam released her first policy address in 2017, which mentioned the establishment of a brand new Civil Service College. In the policy address the following year, it was mentioned again that the college building will be located in Kwun Tong District, which is expected to be opened in 2026. The CSB established the Civil Service Training Advisory Board led by businessman Victor Fung in 2019 to prepare for the construction of a new Civil Service College. Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung stated in an interview with Shenzhen Satellite TV in 2020 that the CSC completed in the future can be like the CCP Central Party School. In 2021, the Hong Kong government plans to establish the CSC within this year and upgrade the facilities of the CSTDI in the North Point Government Offices as the temporary site of the college.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\n\n== List of heads ==\nOscar Kwok Yam-shu, Chinese: 郭蔭庶 (5 July 2022 - incumbent)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCentral Party School of the Chinese Communist Party\nNational Academy of Governance\n\n\n== References ==",

The production included the participation of Antonio Abujamra, Maximira Figueiredo, José Mojica Marins, Mario Gomes, and Chico Anysio.\nWhile keeping the works of this production with Nero and exchanging information, Blanco continued to dedicate himself to gospel music until he suffered a stroke in 2010, being hospitalized in Rio de Janeiro. Despite being in stable condition, he lost all ability to speak. He died on 8 July 2011, at 87 years old.\nIn 2012, the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro paid tribute to him, giving him name to the Mergulhão Billy Blanco, a construction project at the Trevo das Palmeiras (also known as the Cebolão) in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBlanco is the grandfather of singers Pedro Sol and Lua Blanco.\n\n\n== Books ==\nMACEDO, Regina Helena - Tirando de Letra e Música - Editora Record - 1996 - 224 pages- ISBN 85-01-04339-7\nMACEDO, Regina Helena - Florentino Dias: uma vida dedicada a música - Editora Record - 96 pages - ISBN 85-01-05652-9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBilly Blanco Biography on www.musicabrasileira.net",

        "content": "Georgette Augusta Christina Peterson (1863 – 19 April 1947) was a Hungarian-born composer, singer and pianist. Best known as Georgette Peterson, she conducted a choir of 1300 women at the 1907 Australian Exhibition of Women's Work.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGeorgette Augusta Christina Lichtenstein was born in Budapest in 1863.\nShe married Franklin Sievright Peterson in 1890 in Croydon, Surrey. She later accompanied him to Australia where he took up the professorship of music at the University of Melbourne, replacing George Marshall-Hall in 1901.\nPeterson conducted the 1300-voice choir of women at the opening of the Australian Exhibition of Women's Work held in Melbourne in 1907. Her orchestration for the Exhibition Ode, \"God Guide Australia\", was placed second to a version by Florence Maude Ewart. The Melbourne Punch reviewer, however, considered Peterson's superior in its \"perennial flow of captivating and original melody\".\nPeterson's husband died in 1914. She lived in South Yarra during World War I and her son Franklin George Peterson (born in Edinburgh in 1891) served in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea in 1918. She sailed for London in 1920 per the White Star liner, Ceramic. After that, little is recorded of Peterson's life.\nShe was living at Swanage in Dorset, England in 1943 when visited by Hubert Clifford of the BBC in 1943. He programmed some of her songs to celebrate Australia Day in England.\nIn 1946 the Australian Broadcasting Commission produced a series of radio playlets written by G. K. Saunders which including bush songs by Peterson performed by child actress, eight-year-old Andrina Watton.\nShe died at Swanage on 19 April 1947.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nRentoul, Annie R.

        "content": "\"Navi Society\" (“Navi Church\", \"Navi Clan\", \"Gnostic church of the white race\", \"Sacred church of the white race\") - quasi-religious; racist ariosophical neo-Nazi gnostic-neopagan organization, which aims at “the revival of the Russian people consisting of Aryan nations white race\". Founded in 1996 in Moscow on Hitler's birthday by radical right Lazarenko, Ilya Viktorovich. By 2005,  ceased to exist.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhile under investigation for inciting ethnic hatred, Lazarenko broke with Eastern Orthodoxy, which he had previously professed, and in 1996, under the influence of the founder of esoteric Hitlerism: Miguel Serrano organized the \"Navi Society\".\nThe society was specially founded on Hitler's birthday. The first ritual was performed in the day of the autumnal equinox in 1996 at the site of the ancient Dyakovo Gorodishche in Kolomenskoye (Moscow). On April 20, 1997, in the vicinity of the Semyonovskaya metro station (Moscow), followers of the Society performed secret ceremonies in honor of the \"beginning of the era of the white man\", dedicated to Hitler's birthday.\nLater, Lazarenko moved away from neo-pagan activities, and the \"Navi Society\" ceased \ntheir existence. In 2005, he repented and returned to Orthodoxy, preserving his ideological orientation.\n\n\n== Teachings ==\nThe basics of the Society's teachings are set forth in the \"Book of Na'vi\" compiled by Ilya Lazarenko in the late 1990s. The ritual component was not disclosed. Religious ideology is largely based on the texts of Miguel Serrano.\nThe \"Navi Society\" is based on the worship of two supposedly ancient Slavic gods Prav-Yav-Nav. The teaching of the Society is a synthesis of pagan Slavic beliefs with Indo-Aryan (Vedic) and Zoroastrian beliefs. According to Lazarenko, the Na'vi Society is based on Ariosophy, \"the religion of white people that has nothing to do with Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and other religions that glorify the creator god.\" \"White people\" Lazarenko identified only with Russians.\nBy Navya, the followers of the movement understood \"the primordial spiritual principle,\" \"the ideal spiritual world.\" Followers of the movement called themselves adherents of \"Nordic Slavic mythology.\" Lazarenko also spoke of the \"pagan Gnosticism\" that God allegedly brought to the \"white man\" Veles. Lazarenko's goal was to revive the \"most ancient Nordic cult\" or \"Ariosophy,\" which he viewed as the prerogative of the \"higher castes,\" the \"religion of strong-willed people,\" who, according to the founder, should rule the lower castes. Lazarenko called Orthodoxy \"a religion for the flock.\" The Society's teachings were elitist. It was desirable for the followers of the Society to communicate only with people of the \"superior white race\", or \"Hyperborean] God-man\".\nThe racial principle was reduced to the ethnic aspect. The teachings of the Society forbade Russians to have sexual intercourse and marriages with representatives of other ethnic groups. At the same time, Lazarenko distanced himself from any national idea and called for \"religious-political unity.\" \"There is no Russian nation now, there is a Russian-speaking rabble.\" One of the goals of the movement was extermination of people with \"physical deformity\". The Society's teachings included racism and anti-Semitism. One of the main enemies of the Society was Christianity, which was considered a tool Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory against the heirs of the \"light gods.\" Followers of the Society were actively engaged in sports in order to prepare for the struggle for \"Aryan ideals\".\nThe dress code and rituals were similar to those of Ku Klux Klan] . One of the main attributes of the Society's supporters was armbands with Swastika. Novgorod (Celtic]) a cross with a swastika inscribed in it, runic] inscriptions, a ram's skull and Balmung  were also used.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Cite books ===\nAntonova A.

        "content": "Swainsona perlonga is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is Endemic to inland parts of the south-west of Western Australia. It is a scrambling perennial herb with imparipinnate leaves with 7 to 13 egg-shaped or almost round leaflets, and racemes of 7 to 10 purple to lilac-pink flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona perlonga is scrambling perennial herb that typically grows to a height of up to about 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high. Its leaves are imparipinnate, 30–60 mm (1.2–2.4 in) long on a petiole, with 7 to 13, egg-shaped to almost round leaflets, the lower leaflets 3–12 mm (0.12–0.47 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide. There is an egg-shaped stipule 1–7 mm (0.039–0.276 in) long at the base of the petiole. The flowers are arranged in racemes with 7 to 10 flowers on a peduncle about 1 mm (0.039 in) wide, each flower about 10 mm (0.39 in) long on a pedicel about 2 mm (0.079 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long, the sepal lobes about as long as the tube. The petals are purple to lilac-pink, the standard petal about 10 mm (0.39 in) long and wide, the wings about 9 mm (0.35 in) long, and the keel about 10 mm (0.39 in) long and 5 mm (0.20 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) deep. Flowering occurs in August, and the fruit is 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) long and 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona perlonga was first formally described in 1993 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea from specimens collected by Charles Gardner in 1953. The specific epithet (perlonga) means \"very long\", referring to its location, very far from that if the similar S. viridis.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of pea grows in clay on river banks, and swampy or saline areas, in the Geraldton Sandplains, Murchison and Yalgoo bioregions of inland, south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

However, the site is marked by the presence of even older structures dating back to the Augustan age.\nThe villa assumed its current appearance during the period when it belonged to William Waldorf Astor, who purchased it in 1905. He especially took care of the property's park, giving it the characteristics of an English garden.\nDuring the Second World War, between 1943 and 1945, the residence served as the Dutch embassy. During that period, Italian intellectual Benedetto Croce resided in the villa.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe villa is located on a cliff overlooking the Gulf of Naples.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Villa Tritone at Wikimedia Commons",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Irish Traveller Americans are Americans who are of Irish Traveller descent. There are an estimated 30-40,000 Irish Traveller Americans. Irish Travellers are an ethnic group with origins in Ireland; they may or may not consider themselves to be Irish or Irish American.\nMost Irish Travellers are in South Carolina and Texas, especially in the North Augusta and Fort Worth/White Settlement areas specifically. Irish Traveller Americans consist of people originating from immigrants who came to the U.S. before the 20th century, and some who came later during the 1900s and 2000s. Georgia, New York, and Tennessee also have communities of sizable proportions. \nIrish Travellers are often involved in painting, construction, and pavement/asphalt-related work. \n\n\n== History ==\nAn estimated 10,000 people in the United States are descendants of Travellers who left Ireland, mostly between 1845 and 1860 during the Great Famine. However, there are no official population figures regarding Irish Travellers in the United States as the US census does not recognise them as an ethnic group. While some sources estimate their population in the US to be 10,000, others suggest their population is 40,000. According to research published in 1992, Irish Travellers in the US divide themselves up into groups that are based on historical residence: Ohio Travellers, Georgia Travellers, Texas Travellers, and Mississippi Travellers. The Georgia Travellers' camp is made up of about eight hundred families, the Mississippi Travellers, about three hundred families, and the Texas Travellers, under fifty families.\"\nThe largest and most affluent population of about 2,500 lives in Murphy Village in Murphys Estates, outside of the town of North Augusta, South Carolina. Other communities exist in the Memphis, Tennessee/Southaven, Mississippi metropolitan area; Hernando, Mississippi; and near White Settlement, Texas; where the families stay in their homes during the winter, and leave during the summer, while smaller enclaves can be found across Georgia, Alabama, New York, and Mississippi.\nTraditional settled Irish American communities often do not contain sizable populations of Travellers, such as in the Irish-heavy Greater Boston area, for instance; however, a group of Irish Travellers have been reported in Long Island, New York for fighting-related mischief that spilled out on a roadway, from multiple parties coming from multiple cars. Pavement companies owned by settled Irish and Irish Travellers alike have existed and still have presence in the Long Island, New York area and other areas of the East Coast. \nNumbers of Irish Travellers on the West Coast/California remain unknown, although the Phoenix, Arizona and Tucson areas have Irish and Irish Traveller-owned pavement and painting companies and communities of unknown number.\n\n\n== Social issues ==\nWhile the Irish Travellers have communities that prosper more on a socioeconomical stance, such as that in the one in Murphys Estates, South Carolina, their average median income is unknown as the U.S. Census does not consider the Traveller ethnicity to be recognized, and may often be conflated with the Irish American category, or simply Caucasian American. However, Travellers have been covered in Dallas-area news for accidents and deaths that have occurred in their community. In Tarrant County, Texas, where a Traveller community exists, several major incidents have occurred in the 2000s. In January 2000, five Travellers boys, ages 13-14, were killed in a car accident; the pickup they were riding in flipped over a median on Interstate 30 in west Fort Worth and landed upside down on another truck. A father of a boy killed in the wreck would be sentenced to 3 years in prison for scams that occurred in California, Texas, Alaska, and other states in 2005. A mother of one of the boys who died in the accident would later die of a drug overdose at age 48 in 2017. In 2002, Irish Travellers as a community made national news when a Traveller woman with Fort Worth ties was caught on video beating her 4-year-old daughter outside an Indiana store. Pete “Blue” Daley, a 73-year-old Houston Irish Traveller with local ties, was fatally shot outside a motel near Atlanta, Georgia. His murder remains unsolved.\n\n\n== Boxing ==\nAndy Lee, a London-born boxer, moved to Detroit, Michigan in the 2010s to train for his boxing career; he is of Traveller descent.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The lifting beam (also known as traverse, spreader beam) is a steel beam that is attached to the hook of the crane in order to spread the slings from one end of an elongated load (like a wall panel) to another. The bottom of the beam has multiple connection points for hanging of the load.\n\nThe lifting beams are used in multiple cases:\n\nlifting an asymmetrical load. Without a beam, it might be hard to strap the load so that its center of gravity is exactly below the hook;\nhandling a long load with a single-hook crane. Sufficient spread between the slings prevents the load from slipping out;\nincrease the headroom: slings cannot be stretched close to horizontal direction, so attaching them directly to the hook requires minimum distance from the hook to the load. When the lifting beam is used, the slings can be shorter, providing more vertical clearance during lifting;\nif the attachments of the load are on its vertical sides, the slings have to go over the edges of the load and can damage these edges. A lifting beam allows attaching slings to the side lugs without touching the edges;\nthe top of the beam can have two attachment points at the ends thus allowing two cranes to share the load.\n\n\n== See also ==\nContainer spreader\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGorse, C.; Johnston, D.; Pritchard, M.

It is administered as part of the commune of Le Conquet, St-Renan Canton, Brest Arrondissement, in Finistère Department.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1292, two sailors, one Norman and one Bayonnais, quarreled over who would draw water from a well on the island first. The dispute ended in murder, probably of the Norman, and other Norman and French sailors began to assault Aquitainian & English shipping and ports. This eventually escalated into the 1294–1303 Gascon War, which ended in a general return to the status quo but whose financing provoked a clerical crisis leading to the Avignon Papacy and whose settlement terms produced the marriage leading to the Hundred Years' War.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nQuémènès lies 2 nautical miles (3.7 km; 2.3 mi) from Molène, the chief island of the archipelago.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

Super Eight, West. and Naniwa Danshi, then still a part of the trainees, along with other Kansai Jr. groups, had individual performances that lasted until August 25. It was there where the unit's idea was born.\nThe unit's formation announcement was a surprise on April 29, 2024. The same day, an official website was opened, with the photo of all of the members of the 3 collaborating groups dressed in black, together with a teaser video. \"#KAMIGATA_BOYZ\" and \"#KamigataBoys\" dominated the 1st and 2nd place in the trends.\nTheir debut limited-edition single, \"Musekinin de Eejanaika LOVE\" was released in digital form on May 3, under the Storm Labels division Infinity Records, Super Eight's label.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Digital singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKamigata Boyz Oficial site",

        "content": "HD 85709 (HR 3915; 14 G. Sextantis; NSV 18292) is a solitary star located in the equatorial constellation Sextans. It is faintly visible to the naked eye as a red-hued point of light with an apparent magnitude of 5.95. The object is located relatively far at a distance of 1,100 light-years based on Gaia DR3 parallax measurements but it is slowly drifting closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −0.66 km/s. At its current distance, HD 85709's brightness is diminished with an interstellar extinction of two-tenths of a magnitude and it has an absolute magnitude of −1.30.\nHD 85709 has a stellar classification of M2.5 III, indicating that it is an evolved M-type giant star. It is currently on the asymptotic giant branch, the point where it is generating energy via the fusion of hydrogen and helium shells around an inert carbon core. Having expanded to 133 times the radius of the Sun, it now radiates 1,918 times the luminosity of the Sun from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,622 K. HD 85709 is metal enriched with an iron abundance 1.58 times that of the Sun's.\nIn 1991, astronomer V.G. Kornilov and colleagues observed that HD 85709 fluctuated between magnitudes 5.89 and 5.95 in optical light during a photometry survey. As of 2004 however, its variability has not been confirmed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Summerhouse (stylized as SUMMERHOUSE) is a 2024 video game by independent German developer Friedemann Allmenröder and released for Windows and Macintosh by Future Friends Games. The game is a sandbox city-building game in which players decorate environments using building and decorative pieces. Upon release, Summerhouse received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's open-ended design, pace and visual presentation, although some reviewers hoped for greater depth in the game's features and building elements. \n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nSummerhouse is an open-ended sandbox game where players build small towns without gameplay objectives or conditions. Players can use the menu interface to select building elements, including blocks, rooftops, chimneys, doors, windows, decorative features, trees and shrubs, and place them into the world. Four environments are provided, including a mountain, prairie, city and desert. The depth of elements in relation to other objects can be adjusted, and a deletion tool assists in removing unwanted elements after they are placed. Players can also scroll horizontally to pan across the environment. Summerhouse also features hidden secrets and unlockable features, including animations added to certain objects over time and special blocks that are unlocked when certain elements are placed into the environment. A fast forward function allows the player to view the progress of their construction of the town from the start of the game.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nSummerhouse is the first solo release of German independent developer Friedemann Allmenröder. Allmenröder described the game as a \"love letter to the feeling of childhood summer holidays\". An announcement trailer for the game was released in December 2023 for the Steam Wholesome Snack Indie Game Showcase, and released on 8 March 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nSummerhouse received \"generally favorable\" reviews upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The slow pace and open-ended approach to city-building was also praised. Describing the game as \"uniquely peaceful\", Christian Donlan of Eurogamer found the game's simplicity to have a meditative quality. Meghann O'Neil of GamesHub stated the gameplay's peaceful aspects were aided by the \"breezy\" user interface. Jenni Lada of Siliconera also felt the game was a \"zen\" and passive experience that encouraged players \"to live in the moment\". \nCritics generally commended the game's visual presentation and building design. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer enjoyed the \"endless variation\" of items across different architectural styles. Describing Summerhouse as a \"stunning game to look at\", Kieron Verbrugge of Press Start commended the \"picturesque\" environments and \"enchanting\" backdrops. Jasmine Gould-Wilson of GamesRadar found the unlockable animations created \"small touches of surprise\" that encouraged experimentation, with Verbrugge noting the inclusion of animated characters added an aspect of \"emergent, personal storytelling\" to the towns. \nHowever, some reviewers considered that the game could have featured greater depth. Thomas Kent of Hardcore Gamer felt that the lack of objectives could leave players feeling \"aimless\" and was \"too open-ended\". Jenni Lada of Siliconera expressed the desire for greater customisation options and tools, such as resizing elements. Several reviews also felt that the game could have used more pieces to construct buildings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Peltigera cinnamomea, the dog pelt or cinnamon-pelt lichen, is a species of muscicolous (moss-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. The species was formally described by the Canadian lichenologist Trevor Goward in 1995. The lichen is found in forested regions of northwestern North America, particularly in the unique montane and subalpine forest communities of the northern Rocky Mountains. Notably, Peltigera cinnamomea thrives under prolonged snow cover, surviving well into the spring, which distinguishes it from many of the other Peltigera species that inhabit similar North American forest ecosystems.\nPeltigera cinnamomea forms a specialised symbiotic relationship with specific strains of the cyanobacterium Nostoc, which enables it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, crucial for survival in nutrient-poor environments. This lichen is part of the broadly defined species complex centred around the widely distributed Peltigera canina. In this complex, P. cinnamomea falls under the CICADE group, indicating a preference for moist, woodland habitats.\nCharacterised by its leafy thallus, which is loosely attached to its substrate, Peltigera cinnamomea typically measures 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in diameter. The thallus has a distinctive appearance, with a dull, billowed upper surface that is covered in a soft, dense growth of hairs. The species name cinnamomea is reflected in the pale tan undersurface of the thallus, which features rusty-brown, cinnamon-coloured veins. The lichen produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) that bear clear, ascospores with three internal partitions.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe type specimen of Peltigera cinnamomea was collected by the Canadian lichenologist Trevor Goward on 13 April 1985, within the Clearwater River Basin in British Columbia (Canada), at an elevation of 675 m (2,215 ft). The lichen was found growing over a mossy boulder situated in a boulder bed in an open, mixed forest. The species was first scientifically documented in a 1994 report on the Peltigera species in Alberta, published by the Provincial Museum of Alberta. It did not, however, meet the specific standards for valid publication of a new species, due to non-compliance with Articles 39.1 and 40.1 of the nomenclatural rules, which require a clear description and the designation of a type specimen. Goward published it formally a year later in 1995, as part of a synopsis of Peltigera occurring in British Columbia. The species epithet refers to the cinnamon-coloured veins on the thallus underside. Goward called it the \"dog pelt\" in a previous publication before it was officially named. It has also been referred to as the \"cinnamon-pelt lichen\".\nEarly molecular phylogenetics studies of taxa within the Peltigera canina species complex delineated two major monophyletic groups, each with distinct ecological preferences. The two groups are known as CICADE and PORUDI. The acronym CICADE stands for \"Cinnamomea, Canina, Degelii, and their close relatives\", encompassing species that are primarily mesophytic to subhygrophytic. While these species typically occupy humid, woodland habitats, they can also be found in drier locations. Peltigera cinnamomea is a part of the CICADE group, reflecting its preference for environments that maintain moderate to high humidity. This categorisation is supported by genetic data that confirms its close relationship with other species in this group.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPeltigera cinnamomea is characterised by its foliose, loosely attached thallus, which typically spans 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in diameter. The structure of the thallus facilitates various ecological functions. The lobes of this lichen are somewhat leathery and stiff, measuring approximately 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 in) in width, elongating and loosely overlapping with irregular branches. The tips of the lobes are rounded and may either lie flat or curve downwards, with generally smooth margins. The upper surface varies in colour from pale bluish-grey to pale brownish-grey, and may be tinged with shades of cinnamon brown. This surface is dull, often billowed broadly, and covered with a tomentum—a short, soft, dense growth of hairs—that tends to fade near the thallus centre.\nMoving to the underside of the thallus, the lichen lacks soredia (granular reproductive structures) and isidia (outgrowths containing both the algae and the fungus of the lichen), indicative of its specific reproductive and structural characteristics. The margins are devoid of small lobules. The lower surface features pale tan veins that darken to rusty brown or cinnamon brown towards the centre. These veins are narrow, occasionally raised, and smooth (glabrous), while the areas between them (interstices) are whitish and moderately deep. The rhizines, root-like structures, match the colour of the veins and range from simple to intricately branched (penicillate), enhancing the lichen's attachment to its substrate.\nThe cortex of the thallus is 50–80 μm thick, and beneath this lies a photobiont layer, 20–80 μm thick, hosting the cyanobacterium Nostoc. The medulla, located beneath the photobiont layer, is white and measures 70–180 μm in thickness.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are commonly found at the margins on narrow, elongate lobes. These bear a medium brown, longitudinally folded disc, averaging 6–10 mm in length and typically erect. The ascospores are clear (hyaline), three-septate, and measure 40–49 μm in length by 3–5 μm in width, with eight spores per ascus. Conidiomata (asexual reproductive structures) have not been observed to occur in this species.\nOther than trace amounts of unidentified substances, no secondary metabolites (lichen products) have been detected in this species.\n\n\n== Photobiont ==\nPeltigera cinnamomea forms a specialised symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Nostoc, serving as its primary photobiont. Unlike many lichens that may associate with various Nostoc strains, P. cinnamomea specifically partners with certain genetic clusters of Nostoc. Genetic studies have identified specific clusters of Nostoc, indicating a closely adapted relationship in which the lichen's fungal component and its photosynthetic partner have co-evolved to maximise their mutual survival benefits. This partnership is particularly beneficial for P. cinnamomea, enabling it to efficiently fix atmospheric nitrogen, vital for thriving in nutrient-sparse environments. Such a tailored relationship suggests that the distribution of Peltigera cinnamomea may be closely tied to the presence of its specific Nostoc partners, reflecting a delicate balance between the lichen and its preferred photobiont environments.\n\n\n== Similar species ==\nPeltigera cinnamomea is often recognizable in its natural habitat but was previously overlooked in taxonomic classifications, frequently misidentified as Peltigera praetextata. Unlike P. praetextata, which has brownish or tan-coloured veins that are often tomentose and partially erect, P. cinnamomea has paler veins. P. praetextata also has somewhat crisped lobe margins with lobules, particularly on older parts of the thallus. Although both species occur throughout inland British Columbia, P. cinnamomea predominantly inhabits areas with prolonged snow cover, persisting until May or June, conditions under which P. praetextata is absent.\n\nPeltigera cinnamomea closely resembles the isidiate lichen Peltigera evatzsiana, indicating a potential primary-secondary species pair relationship. This similarity warrants careful observation for accurate identification.\nExpanding on comparisons within the genus Peltigera, P. cinnamomea is grouped with species that feature Nostoc as a primary photobiont and have an appressed laminal tomentum. It shares similar lobe widths of 1.5–3 cm with P. canina, P. membranacea, and P. retifoveata, contrasting with the narrower lobes of P. didactyla and P. ponojensis. The vein characteristics—pale to cinnamon brown and low to partly raised—of P. cinnamomea differ markedly from the darker, more elevated veins of P. praetextata and the broad, strongly raised veins of P. retifoveata. Apothecia are frequently observed in P. cinnamomea, similar to P. canina, P. membranacea, and P. rufescens, but are less common in P. retifoveata. Unlike most species in this comparison, only P. retifoveata consistently demonstrates chemical traits, whereas P. cinnamomea does not. The ecological preference of P. cinnamomea for mesic to hygric environments, particularly snowy locales, differs from the xeric to mesic habitats preferred by P. canina, P. didactyla, and P. ponojensis. These distinctions in ecological adaptations and morphological features facilitate the identification and differentiation of P. cinnamomea from closely related species.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nPeltigera cinnamomea is found in a range of forested habitats across western North America. It predominantly grows on moss, as well as moss-covered rocks and logs, in both open and somewhat sheltered inland forests at various elevations. This species adapts well to mesophytic to hygrophytic conditions and is particularly prevalent in areas that experience prolonged periods of snow cover, often surviving under snow until late spring or early summer (May or June). This resilience makes it one of the most snow-tolerant species among the many Peltigera species that occur in the local lichen funga.\nIn terms of geographical distribution, P. cinnamomea has been extensively documented in several regions, and is locally widespread in suitable forested habitats. It is most abundant in the Rocky Mountains. In Canada, collections have been made in Alberta at Swan Hills and in British Columbia at multiple locations including the Clearwater River Basin, Skeena River Basin, Skagit River Basin, Fraser River Basin, and Nechako River Basin. In the United States, it has been identified in Montana at Lake Country and in Pend Oreille County, Washington. It also occurs in Oregon. In Alaska, most records of the lichen have been from the southeast region of the state. P. cinnamomea is one of 29 Peltigera species that occur in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nPeltigera cinnamomea thrives in specific ecological communities within montane and subalpine forests in the northern Rocky Mountains, specifically in the northern Whitefish Range, Montana, USA. These communities are classified in a unique forest order called Calamagrostio-Pseudotsugetalia glaucae, which is an ecological community characterised by its dominant plant species and unique environmental conditions. This classification, though termed an \"order\", essentially groups together ecosystems with similar species compositions and interactions, typical of valley bottoms and lower slopes across northwestern North America. These forests are markedly distinct from the coastal forests of the Vaccinio-Piceetea class, filling ecological niches similar to those of broad-leaved forests in other temperate regions. Influenced by Pacific air masses, these areas benefit from moist conditions and extensive snow cover, providing a stable environment conducive to the growth of species like Peltigera cinnamomea.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn terms of conservation status information, Peltigera cinnamomea is assessed as \"S5\" status for its Provincial Conservation Status in British Columbia (\"demonstrably widespread, abundant, and secure\"); as \"yellow\" in the B.C. List Status (\"apparently secure and not at risk of extinction\"); it has not been assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. In Oregon, it was listed as a \"taxon of concern\" by the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

He attended Diocesan College in Cape Town and was a Western Province long jump champion.\nWilliams, a speedy winger, won his first Springboks call up as an 18-year old injury replacement on the 1931–32 tour of Britain and Ireland, though still uncapped at provincial level. He appeared in three tour matches, scoring a try against Llanelli, but a broken collarbone ruled him out of Test contention.\nIn 1937, Williams made his second Springboks touring squad, playing five Tests in Australia and New Zealand. He scored two tries against the All Blacks, as the Springboks gave the New Zealand side their first ever home series defeat.\nWilliams played all three Tests against the 1938 British Lions, starring in the 1st Test with two tries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Africa national rugby union players\n\n\n== External links ==\nDai Williams at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Ninovium was a synthetic element that was purportedly discovered in 1999 by Victor Ninov and his team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Initially claimed as element 118, now oganesson, Ninovium's existence was based on alleged decay chains observed during experiments aimed at synthesizing superheavy elements. However, subsequent investigations revealed discrepancies and fabricated data, leading to the retraction of the claimed discovery and the dismissal of Ninov for scientific misconduct.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Ninovium originates from Victor Ninov's surname, following with the suffix -ium, which is used indicate an entity that is an element according to the IUPAC rules.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNinovium was reported by original observations as a superheavy element. While its exact characteristics remain lost media, theoretical predictions suggest that Ninovium would likely possess a high atomic number, potentially exceeding 118 protons and 184 neutrons in its nucleus. Due to its position in the periodic table, Ninovium would belong to the transactinide series and is expected to exhibit properties similar to other superheavy elements, such as high instability and extremely short half-lives. However, these predictions are based on theoretical models and have not been experimentally confirmed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\nIn 1999, Victor Ninov, along with his team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, reported the creation of element 118 based on observed decay chains. However, further attempts to recreate element weren't successful. Berkeley Laboratory allowed investigation to take place in 2001, which later revealed that data in report was manually modified. Ninov was convicted to be the fabricator of the report, but he denied all allegations of the investigation.\nIn 2002, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia, Dubna has acquired element 118 with use of Californium and Calcium, and named it Oganesson. Research was published in 2006 and International tests confirmed that the element was indeed acquired. Since then Ninov's formula for acquiring 118th element hasn't been proven working.\n\n\n=== Refutation ===\nThe controversy surrounding Ninovium's discovery led to allegations of scientific misconduct against Victor Ninov, ultimately resulting in his dismissal from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2002.\nDespite the initial claims of its discovery, Ninovium's existence as a valid element remains unsubstantiated, and its characteristics remain uncertain.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fabius Titianus was a Roman politician and senator in the fourth century AD.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTitianus had a long and successful career as an official; during his life he held many positions in the Empire, including the consulship.\nTitianus served as Corrector of Picenum, Proconsul of the province of Sicily (dates unknown), and Proconsul of Asia (between 324 and 337 AD). In 337 AD, he was elected consul together with Flavius Felicianus as his colleague.\nAfter the death of Constantine I, he continued to serve under Constantine's youngest son, Constans, serving as Urban Prefect of Rome from 339 to 341 AD. From 341 or 342 AD, until the end of Constans' reign in 350 AD, Titianus was Praetorian Prefect of Gaul.\nHe supported the rebellion of the usurper Magnentius, for which he was again appointed Urban Prefect of Rome, holding the office from 350 to 351 AD. Shortly before the Battle of Mursa, Titianus arrived at the court of Constantius II as the ambassador of Magnentius. He accused the Constantinian dynasty of allowing the destruction of cities through negligence and advised him to abdicate in favor of Magnentius. Constantius rejected the proposal, but Titianus was freely released back to Magnentius.\nTitianus was known to have been a pagan. He was a Quindecimviri sacris faciundis in a priestly college.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJones, A.H.M.; J.R. Martindale & J. Morris (1971).

        "content": "The Joint Operations Force (Arabic: قوة العمليات المشتركة), formerly known as the 24th Infantry Battalion, is a large military unit composed of well trained military personnel based in the city of Misrata. It has been known to fight off Islamist extremist groups, such as ISIL and Al-Qaeda, as well as participating operations that intercept human traffickers and fuel smugglers. This force commonly advocates for a single unified Libyan military as well as enhancing the security and stability of the country and protecting national sovereignty.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAfter the 3-month siege that the city of Misrata endured, many battalions began to form in order to resist the constant bombardment by Pro-Gaddafi forces. One of them being the 24th Infantry Battalion.\nAfter the Libyan revolution, this Battalion continued to participate in counter-Terrorism operations. It was later merged with various other groups to form the Joint Operations Force in 2013.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nAs of 2023, the J.O.F has been receiving an annual funding of 40,000,000 LYD from the Libyan government. These funds are directed towards countering terrorism operations, human trafficking acts, as well as keeping the city under control, which has resulted in much lower crime rate, making Misrata the safest city in Libya.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nOn September 7, 2021, the Misratan Joint Operations Force reported the capture of a high-ranking member of ISIS, Embark al-Khazm, in Bani Walid. Acting on orders from the Attorney General, the Joint Operations Force conducted the arrest. Prime Minister Abdul Hameed Dabaiba of the GNU commended the Joint Operations Force for their efforts and welcomed Khazm's arrest.\n13 March 2023, the J.O.F seized a large shipment of drugs in the port of Misrata. The drugs was discovered to be ecstasy, and was estimated at 1.7 million pills. They were hidden inside a number of cars on board a ship coming from the port of Antwerp, Belgium, carrying about 2,400 cars.\nOn 8 May 2023, the J.O.F announced the successful eradication of 88,000 hallucinogenic tablets discovered aboard a vessel at the Misrata seaport. Acting in accordance with legal protocols and in collaboration with Misrata's port customs, the entire shipment was destroyed to prevent its circulation. The tablets, identified as Levitril or \"Rouge,\" were concealed within two vehicles on board a ship arriving from Italy. This operation marks a significant interception in combating illicit drug trafficking.\n14 May 2023, the J.O.F announced the apprehension of a criminal group responsible for kidnapping and extorting foreign medical personnel from a hospital in Misrata. Following a report of the incident, the Attorney General in Misrata directed a thorough investigation and rescue operation. Subsequently, the kidnappers were captured, and the victims were safely rescued. The arrested individuals confessed to their crimes and were taken into legal custody for prosecution.\nJune 2023, the J.O.F, in collaboration with the Misrata Free Zone customs center, intercepted a large quantity of diesel fuel intended for smuggling out of the country via the Misrata sea port. The fuel, concealed within 14 containers labeled for export as used oils, had a total capacity of 20,000 liters each. Routine inspections led to the discovery, and those responsible were detained pending legal action.\nOn April 20, 2024, the J.O.F received a report stating that two citizens had found a suspicious plastic bag on the beach in a certain area of Misrata city. Immediately, patrols of the force headed to the location where the bag was found. Upon inspection, the bag was found to contain approximately 25 tightly sealed plastic packages containing white powder suspected to be cocaine. In appreciation of the citizens' efforts and \"trust in the Joint Operations Force,\" a financial reward was given to them, \"We urge all citizens to promptly report any suspicious materials or bags that may pose a threat to the security and safety of our country and its people\".\n\n\n== February 17 ==\nDuring February 17 Annual festival, the February 17 Revolutionary forces in Misrata staged large parades in various locations, including Al-Jazeerat al-A'lam and Tripoli Street, marking the thirteenth anniversary of Gaddafi's overthrow. Tens of thousands of Misratan residents came together to commemorate the revolution. The J.O.F showcased readiness to combat terrorism in all forms, as well as opposition to corruption in all forms.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is the 2024 Junior European all-around, uneven bars, and team champion. \n\n\n== Career ==\nColas began gymnastics at three years old at the club Avoine-Beaumont because her mother was a coach there.\n\n\n=== Espoir ===\nColas won the all-around title at the 2021 French Championships in the 11-year-old category, standing out for her high level of difficulty for her age. She made her international debut at the 2021 Swiss Cup Juniors. She placed fifth in the all-around and helped the French team win the bronze medal behind Germany and Belgium. She won the all-around in the espoir division at the 2021 Tournoi International and the Avoine club won the team title. In the event finals, she won the gold medal on the balance beam, the silver medal on the uneven bars, and the bronze medals on the vault and floor exercise.\nColas won the all-around title in the espoir division at the 2022 Elek Matolay Memorial. She then won gold medals on the vault and balance beam in the event finals. She helped Avoine-Beaumont win the Top 12 Finals by winning all four events. Then at the French Championships, she won the all-around title in the 12-year-old division by more than 13 points. At the 2022 Tournoi International, she won six medals- gold in the all-around, vault, uneven bars, and balance beam, and silver in the team and floor exercise.\nAt the 2023 Top 12 Finals, Colas helped Avoine-Beaumont win its third consecutive title. She then won her third consecutive French national all-around title, this time in the 13-year-old division.\n\n\n=== Junior ===\nColas had the highest all-around score in the European Championships selection meet, and she was named to the French junior team. Before the European Championships, she competed at the Magglingen Junior Friendly where she won the all-around gold medal and helped the French team win the gold medal by nearly 10 points.\nTwo days after her 14th birthday, Colas led the French team to a gold medal at the 2024 Junior European Championships, and she won the individual all-around title. Then in the event finals, she tied with Italy's Giulia Perotti for the gold medal on the uneven bars, and she won the bronze medal on the vault.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peg o' My Heart is a 1912 play written by J. Hartley Manners. It has three acts, a medium-sized cast, one setting, and moderate pacing. The story is set at the English mansion of the socially prominent Chichester family, whose lives are changed by the introduction of an Irish-American heiress into their midst.\nIt was first produced by Oliver Morosco and staged by the playwright. The massive single setting was designed by Robert Brunton. The play  starred Laurette Taylor, who had recently signed a three-year contract with Morosco. It opened in Los Angeles during May 1912, where it ran for eleven weeks. Its Broadway premiere came in December 1912. It was a huge success there, playing over 600 times through May 1914, establishing new records \"for longest consecutive run of any comedy in New York City\" and continuous performances by a female star. Critical reviews on both coasts emphasized the importance of Taylor's performance over the content of the play.\nMorosco had announced a prize to write a song for the play in March 1912; a year later the winner Peg o' My Heart was released, also to popular success. Manners published his play, but he also published a novel expanding and encompassing the comedy with background and future events. The play had a moderately successful Broadway revival from February through April 1921, and was the basis for a 1922 silent film and a 1933 musical.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nCharacters are listed in order of appearance within their scope, and as defined in 1912 cast lists. Differences with the published play are in footnotes.\nLead\n\nMargaret O'Connell called Peg, is 18, the pretty American-born daughter of an Irish immigrant and his English wife.\nSir Gerald Adair called Jerry, is a wealthy young lawyer, Peg's only friend in England; she is unaware of his title.\nSupporting\n\nMrs. Chichester addressed by her son as \"Mater\" but named Monica; she is a narrow-minded, self-absorbed widow.\nEthel is Mrs. Chichester's daughter; she is intelligent, frank, proud, bored and horrified at accepting charity.\nAlaric is Mrs. Chichester's son, a friend of Jerry; not a bad sort and well-educated, but weak-minded and indolent.\nFeatured\n\nChristian Brent is a young married man; a long-winded cad who wants to seduce Ethel and Peg.\nMontgomery Hawkes is a middle-aged barrister who informs the Chichester family about Nathaniel's will.\nFootman is a servant in Mrs. Chichester's household.\nMaid is the maid in Mrs. Chichester's household.\nCanine\n\nMichael is Peg's terrier mutt, her constant companion, whom she has smuggled into England.\nPet is Ethel's female french poodle, a dainty creature unable to deal with Michael.\nOff stage\n\nNathaniel Kingsworth is Mrs. Chichester's recently deceased brother, who leaves a will favoring his niece Peg.\nAngelia O'Connell long dead, was Peg's mother, sister to both Nathaniel and Mrs. Chichester.\nFrank O'Connell is Peg's father and widower of Angelia, hopeless with money. Peg admires and speaks of him often.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nAct I (Drawing room of Regal Villa, the Chichester mansion in Scarborough, on June 1st.) The Chichester family learns their bank has closed its doors. Brent comes to pester Ethel. Peggy, just arrived from New York, enters unannounced, and refuses to explain herself. Exasperated, Ethel sends her to the servants quarters, while Alaric sees off Brent. Mr. Hawkes explains the curious will of Nathaniel Kingsworth to the Chichesters. They will have £1000 per annum if they agree to teach Peg refinement. Peg is not to know the conditions of the will, but if she refuses to stay or her character is found wanting, the Chichesters get nothing. Peg is fetched back from the servants' rooms to appall her relatives with her outspoken ways, dowdy clothes, and weatherbeaten mutt. Mr. Hawkes gets all parties to agree on a one-month trial. Ordered to her new room, Peg defies the maid only to find the house empty. A summer storm begins, and Peg is frightened by Jerry coming in through the French windows from the garden. Jerry soothes Peg's apprehensions and explains he knows who she is; he was Nathaniel's friend. The Chichesters return, surprised to find Jerry with her. They all go in to lunch together, Peg defying Mrs. Chichester's order to eat in her room. (Curtain)\n\nAct II (Same, a month later.) Brent sneaks up on Peg while she's reading a book from Jerry. He pesters, grabs and embraces her, then gets slapped in the face. Ethel enters as Peg runs out, and Brent pivots smoothly to another target. Ethel agrees to elope with Brent that night. Peg returns after Brent leaves, and Jerry joins the two girls. He invites them to a dance. Ethel declines, Peg accepts. When Ethel goes to fetch her mother at Peg's insistence, Jerry and Peg discuss her situation. He convinces her to stay another month. Peg admits they are friends now, and maybe more... However, Mrs. Chichester forbids her to go to the dance. Peg does get her permission to stay up late to study. Everyone has gone to bed, when Peg quietly gets her hat and coat to go out with Jerry. But Ethel also creeps quietly down the stairs with her own coat and travel bag. Peg forcibly stops Ethel, telling her a life of misery awaits her with Brent. Ethel breaks down, confessing her misery at living on Peg's charity. Peg is baffled; she knows nothing of the will. When Peg trips and knocks over an urn, the sudden noise awakens the household. Peg tells Ethel to follow her lead. She convinces Mrs. Chichester that Ethel just caught her, Peg, trying to sneak out to the dance. Mrs. Chicester excortiates Peg for her disobedience. Peg says she will leave in the morning, but Ethel faints. Peg scolds Mrs. Chichester for not caring about her daughter, while tending to Ethel. (Curtain) \n\nAct III (Same, the next morning.) Ethel convinces her mother to reconsider Peg's departure, since it will leave the family insolvent. Mrs. Chichester approaches Alaric with the suggestion he propose to Peg to keep her at Regal Villa. He reluctantly agrees, but is relieved when Peg laughs, and thanks her for rejecting him. Next Mr. Hawkes arrives; he too proposes to Peg, but adds the curious condition that the engagement should last until she turns 21. She refuses his offer and insists on departing for New York. But now Jerry arrives, and Peg learns he is Sir Gerald, co-executor of her uncle's will. He explains that far from being a guest of the Chichesters, she is actually subsidizing them. Also, if she obeys the will, she will receive £5000 annually at age 21. He then informs the family that their bank has reopened and their capital is secure, so Peg's sinecure is no longer needed. Despite this, Ethel and Alaric urge Peg to stay, while Mrs. Chichester ignores her. However, Peg is determined to see her father again, and so rejects the inheritance. Jerry proposes to her and is accepted, with the understanding he will have to follow her to New York. (Curtain)\n\n\n== Original production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe play was written in 1911, while the first public mention came in January 1912, when The Los Angeles Times noted Morosco had secured it for early local production by his Burbank Theatre stock company. By March 1912 it was known that Laurette Taylor would star and that it had been written especially for her by Manners.\nTaylor was then performing in another Morosco production, The Bird of Paradise, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre on Broadway. The play was closed on April 13, 1912, so she could be freed up for Peg o' My Heart. Her leading man was to be Henry Stanford, brought out to Los Angeles from Broadway, where he had been playing in a revival of Monsieur Beaucaire with Lewis Waller.\n\n\n=== Cast ===\n\n\n=== Los Angeles opening ===\nPeg o' My Heart had its first public performance as a Sunday matinee at Morosco's Burbank Theatre on May 26, 1912. Morosco had a stock company at the theatre, who filled some parts, with others drawn from Belasco players in town. Reviewers agreed on two things: that Taylor's performance outshone the play, and that Donald Bowles was mistakenly playing Alaric as a simpleton. Julian Johnson of The Los Angeles Times said: \"The feature of the whole thing is Laurette Taylor as 'Peg'. Peg a la Taylor is bigger than the play surrounding her\", and he called her \"one of the subtlest comediennes on our stage today\". He also revealed that the audience was not quite up to some of the lines: \"Much of the satire of Peg o' My Heart is so delicate that daylight kills it. Which accounts for many firecracker lines passing noiselessly over the heads at yesterday's matinee\".\nOriginally scheduled for an eight-week run, the production was still attracting standing-room only crowds at eleven weeks when forced to close on August 3, 1912, to make way for Richard Bennett in The Deep Purple. The string of 101 consecutive performances set a record for the Burbank Theatre.\n\n\n=== Broadway premiere ===\nThe Broadway premiere for Peg o' My Heart had long been scheduled as the inaugural work for the new Cort Theatre. However, construction took longer than anticipated, so the premiere was slipped until December 1912. Laurette Taylor and J. Hartley Manners confirmed their engagement on November 2, 1912, but said the wedding would have to wait until after the Christmas holidays as they were too busy with play preparations.\nPeg o' My Heart premiered at the Cort Theatre on December 20, 1912, with only Emelie Melville (Mrs. Chichester) carried over from the Los Angeles cast. Reviewers devoted some of their space to the aesthetics of the newly opened theatre, but their general conclusions mirrored the earlier critics, that the play was all Taylor. The reviewer for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said the other characters were impossible due to the writing. The New-York Tribune reported: \"After the second act Peg was forced by determined applause to make a speech, and Peg - not Laurette Taylor - responded. For once the curtain speech was a success...\". And the critic for The New York Times said \"...it will be impossible to imagine 'Peg' without Miss Taylor, or for a long time to come, Miss Taylor without 'Peg'... The others do not matter, with the exception of Mr. H. Reeves-Smith, who does mostly nothing, but does it splendidly. In fact, when Miss Taylor is off the stage the curtain might as well be down\".\n\n\n=== Broadway closing ===\nThe play closed on Saturday, May 30, 1914, having been performed 604 times, a then record for a comedy. Laurette Taylor was hailed by The New York Times for having never missed a single performance, which it called \"a world's record for a female star\". Among other statistics compiled and cited by the newspaper were $788,340 in gross receipts and a viewing audience of 524,272. Another newspaper pointed out that the 604 number was \"exclusive of special performances\" for benefits and one private performance given at the request of Sarah Bernhardt.\n\n\n== Revival ==\nPeg o' My Heart was given a revival by producer Abe Erlanger at the Cort Theatre starting February 14, 1921. Laurette Taylor reprised her starring role, but with a different supporting cast. It ran through April 29, 1921, for 88 performances.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nDuring March 1912, two months before Peg o' My Heart opened, Morosco announced a $1000 prize for a song to complement the new play. He renewed the offer a year later, with the judging to be done by Laurette Taylor, J. Huntly Manners, and George Mooser.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nManners first adapted his play to short story form in March 1913 for the magazine of The Sunday World. In October 1913 he published a novel based on it, comprising the play, background events, and subsequent happenings. The novel was organized into five \"books\", of which only the fourth covered events from the play, albeit greatly expanded and with changes. The novel introduced new characters and additional plotlines. There were two editions of the novel: a special \"Laurette Taylor\" edition with a page devoted to the history of the production (at the time still going on Broadway), and a mass edition published by Grossett & Dunlop. Both editions were copyrighted by Dodd, Mead & Company.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nPeg o' My Heart (1922 film)\nPeg o' My Heart (1933 film)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Synopsis source ===\nJ.

        "content": "The Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System (iAVs) is a food production method that combines aquaculture and olericulture  within a closed system. It was developed in the 1980s by Dr. Mark McMurtry and colleagues at North Carolina State University including Professor Doug Sanders, Paul V. Nelson and Merle Jensen. This system is one of the earliest instances of a closed-loop aquaponic system. Many of the modern developments and discoveries of aquaponics are generally attributed to the New Alchemy Institute and North Carolina State University. Further research on aquaponics at North Carolina State University was discontinued due to the fact that the system was ready for commercial application. Today's flood-and-drain systems, as favoured by backyard practitioners, are derived from this model.\nIn an iAVs, fish are raised in tanks, and the nutrient-rich water from these tanks is used to irrigate and fertilize grow beds filled with plants that take up the nutrients, purifying the water, which is then recirculated back to the fish tanks. The system uses sand-based grow beds to perform multiple functions, including plant support, biofiltration, particulate removal, and nutrient delivery to plants, without the need for separate biofilters. This multi-functional use of sand beds contributes to the relative simplicity of the iAVs design compared to other aquaponic systems.\nIn previous integrated fish-vegetable systems, fish effluent and suspended solids were removed from water through sedimentation before being applied to plants which resulted in insufficient residual nutrients for good plant growth, compared to iAVs, which extracts fish effluent, including solids, from the bottom of the fish tanks at regular intervals up to eight times daily, from dawn to sunset. The effluent is pumped directly onto the surface of the sand beds, which serve as both biological and mechanical filtration and the locus for oxidation of organic solids.\nIn traditional recirculatory aquaculture, carbonate inputs have been used to neutralize the acidification resulting from nitrification. However, researchers found that alkaline amendment was unnecessary when the nitrogen input rate approximated the nitrogen assimilation rates of the plants. In the IAVS research, water pH remained stable at approximately pH 6.0 when fish-feed rates were not excessive.\nIAVS is also referred to as Sandponics which is actually a trademark for Agricultural cultivating equipment.\n\n\n== External links ==\nIAVS Official Website\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paul Zech (19 February 1881 – 7 September 1946) was a German expressionist writer and poet.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPaul Zech came from the large family of a craftsman as the eldest of six surviving children. At the age of 5, he was entrusted to his maternal grandparents. He attended school until the age of 14 and then began an apprenticeship in baking which was unsuccessful. He then left for Belgium to work in the coal mines of the Charleroi basin, in 1898. Back in Germany he married Helene Siemon, a shoemaker's daughter in July 1904, whom he had a child with.\nZech began writing his first poems in 1901. His poems were published in local or regional magazines. In 1907, he took part in the annual Cologne poetry competition and received “honorable mention”. From 1910 he lived in Berlin and turned to poetry.  He published in Herwarth Walden's expressionist journal Der Sturm and founded his own publication Das neue Pathos. His poems earned him the Kleist Prize in 1918. While keeping a classic form, his poems reveal a tendency towards expressionism through the themes of the city, mines, oppression, and alienation.\nAt the start of the First World War, in 1914 Zech wrote patriotic poems but by 1915, his enthusiasm for the war gave way to skepticism. He participated in the battles on the Western Front, notably at the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. In the summer of 1916 he was seriously injured when he was buried in a trench. He was decorated with the Iron Cross. In 1917, he was assigned to the rear of the front. He then wrote propaganda texts for the army. Under the pseudonym Michel Michael, he published pacifist poems in 1919.\nThe years immediately after the war were the high point of the literary career. In 1918 he was again awarded the Kleist Prize for his poetry. His financial wealth allowed him to acquire a small house near Lake Bestensee to the southeast of Berlin. Severe mental problems forced him to spend several months in a psychiatric hospital. He subsequently led a double life. He had a relationship with singer Hilde Herb, which led to financial setbacks.\nDespite his many difficulties, he was extremely creative in the post-war years. In 1921, he published anonymously erotic poems (Allegro de Plaisir), including sonnets inspired by his relationship with the young Hilde Herb. He also wrote autobiographical stories such as The Mad Heart (1925), The Journey of Pain (1925). He also wrote essays and literary dramas. He adapted Le Bateau ivre by Arthur Rimbaud for the theater in 1926.\n\nAt first in August 1933, suspected of embezzlement and theft, he left Berlin for Vienna and Trieste and embarked there for Montevideo, Buenos Aires. As a supporter of the SPD and prominent left-wing intellectual, Zech did not return to Nazi Germany. He became popular with the German anti-Nazi community in Argentina. At the end of the Second World War, he decided to return to Germany but was not able to do so because of his financial difficulties. He died in Buenos Aires after suffering an illness in September 1946.\nHis urn was moved to the Städtischer Friedhof III cemetery in Berlin-Friedenau in 1971. The grave is one of the honorary graves of the state of Berlin.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Original works ===\nDie Liste allein der Buchpublikationen Zechs umfasst viele Dutzend Titel.\n\nDas schwarze Revier.

        "content": "Florence Ravenel (March 18, 1896 – December 18, 1975) also known as Florence Ray, was an American stage, radio and film actress, perhaps best known for her work on the radio series The Court of Missing Heirs, and on the TV sitcom The Farmer's Daughter.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in Michigan, but raised primarily in Brooklyn, New York, Ravenel attended Hunter College and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.\n\n\n=== Stage ===\nRavenel made her professional dramatic debut—billed as Florence Ravanel—in the fall of 1923 with the William Augustin Players in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Of her performance in Avery Hopwood's Fair and Warmer, Billboard reported, \"Florence Ravanel made a hit as Laura Bartlett\". Shortly thereafter, Ravenel found more lucrative employment with the Al Luttringer Players.  Towards the end of a three-week engagement with that troupe at the Music Hall Theatre in Akron, Ohio (featuring The Cat and the Canary, Getting Gertie's Garter, Guy Bolton's Polly, Preferred, and My Irish Cinderella), The Beacon Journal singled out Ravenel's contribution, noting that the actress had tackled \"hard roles and won praise from her audience.\"\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Ravenel appeared in stock company revivals of Lightnin' (portraying Mildred Buckley, \"and doing it with a certain charm\"), Parlor, Bedroom and Bath as Angelica Irving (a role previously played onscreen by Kathleen Kirkham, and subsequently by Dorothy Christy) and, as Madeleine, in the Goodman-Knoblock adaptation of Robert Keable's Simon Called Peter. Also in 1927, she appeared \"to splendid advantage\" alongside Jack Davis and William Rath as Keala Leilani in the premiere of Tropical Love, a South Seas-set melodrama staged at the Majestic Theatre in Waukegan, Illinois. At that same venue the following month, Ravenel was the main attraction in Anita Loos' Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, \"giv[ing] an absorbing performance of the part—i.e. Lorelei Lee—which was played by June Walker in New York\"\nAs of February 1928, Ravenel appears to have taken up residence in Chicago, Illinois, where her membership in that city's Associate Players was advertised in the Southtown Economist. In March, the company's production of Avery Hopwood's The Alarm Clock featured Ravenel as Mrs. Dunsmore. That summer, Ravenel toured with Jeanne Eagels' company in a vaudeville recreation of scenes from Eagels' recent vehicle, The Cardboard Lover. The following year, she gave a well-received performance as Arlette in a revival of Seventh Heaven staged by the Guy and Eloda Beach stock company in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nIn 1933, Ravenel was promoted from the ranks of KYW staffers to host the station's daily noontime dance program featuring Rex Maupin's orchestra. Beginning in the fall of 1937, Ravenel was heard, alongside Jack Brinkley, Elizabeth Reller, Dorothy Day, Henry Saxe, John Goldsworthy, Bob Middleton, and others in The Court of Missing Heirs. She was also featured as Mrs. Sniffer on Arnold Grimm's Daughter. On January 30, 1943, Ravenel was one of the few non-singing performers heard in Chicago Theater of the Air's production of Victor Herbert's Sweethearts. In 1948, Ravenel, Parley Baer, Jerry Farber and announcer Patrick McGeehan were among those featured on the Catholic program, The Hour of St. Francis. Beginning in 1951, she co-starred with Lamont Johnson, Raymond Burr and Ruth Swanson in The Pendleton Story, produced by the Armed Forces Radio Service, described as the service's \"first family series for overseas release.\"\nBetween 1950 and 1952, Ravenel also appeared in at least two episodes each of Dr. Christian and NBC Theater, most notably in the latter's production of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, starring Virginia Christine and featuring Ravenel as Aunt Julie.\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nIn the fall of 1951, Ravenel joined 12 fellow former radio actors in the cast of Arch Oboler's The Twonky.\nMaking a brief return to the stage in 1956, Ravenel appeared with Naomi Stevens and many others in what The Hollywood Reporter's Marvin Smith judged a much-improved revival of Sumner Locke Elliott's unsuccessful Broadway comedy, Buy Me Blue Ribbons, providing an ideal showcase for the show's star, a young Paul Smith.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nOn December 18, 1975, Ravenel died at age 79 in Los Angeles of undisclosed causes, predeceased by her mother. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlorence Ravenel at IMDb",
