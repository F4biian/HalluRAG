        "content": "The Leposavić ambush was an ambush in North Kosovo resulting in the killing of an Indian officer. The ambush was allegedly carried out by the Albanian National Army (ANA) and the Kosovo Protection Corps (TMK). This marked the first deadly assault on Kosovo's UN police force since the Kosovo War, as stated by UN officials. While the perpetrators have not been officially confirmed by the UN, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojša Čović claimed that it was the ANA and the TMK behind these attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was established in 1999 following the Kosovo War, which saw NATO intervention to halt Serbian repression of Kosovo Albanians. UNMIK was mandated to administer and govern Kosovo, which was placed under interim UN administration. Its mission included maintaining law and order, facilitating the return of refugees, and promoting democratic governance. UNMIK's presence in Kosovo involved various components, including civil administration, police, judiciary, and civil society.\nThe mission aimed to build institutions and promote stability while fostering dialogue between different ethnic communities, particularly Albanians and Serbs. However, Kosovo's status remained unresolved, with Albanians advocating for independence while Serbia insisted on maintaining sovereignty over the territory. Efforts to reach a negotiated settlement, including talks between Belgrade and Pristina, faced numerous challenges and setbacks.\n\n\n== Ambush ==\nOn 4 August 2003, while Major Satish Menon and another officer were driving their patrol car, they stopped and slowed due to rocks on the road between Leposavić and Mitrovica. During their stop, their car came under heavy gunfire from concealed gunmen. Multiple shots were fired where Menon was sitting and was soon struck, killing him instantly.\n\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nThe perpetrators are contentious, however, the UN asserts that the ANA is responsible for the attack, based on the available information and intelligence. The Serbian Government also attributes the TMK as a suspected perpetrator. The UN offered US$56,000 to anyone who could arrest the perpetrator.                                \n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== United Nations ===\nUNMIK administraitor and American diplomat Charles Brayshaw strongly denounced the  ambush, labeling it as \"despicable\" and \"repugnant\" act of murder while also condemning it as \"a direct attack on international forces of law and order.\"\n\n\n=== Serbia ===\nThe Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, Nebojša Čović, blamed the outlawed ANA for the ambush, suggesting possible involvement of the TMK as well.                                         \n\n\n=== Kosovo Albanians ===\nOn the Albanian side, local politicians attributed the shooting to \"Serb extremist elements.\" However, despite the attack occurring in the Serb-dominated north of the province, the UN was investigating the possibility that it might have been carried out by a hardline ethnic Albanian group.\n\n\n== References ==",

Raisler praised the episode for wrapping up the narrative, feeling optimistic for the next season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnderson, Jenna (May 29, 2018). \"'iZombie': 7 Questions Raised by the Season 4 Finale\".

        "content": "Micromyrtus vernicosa is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to a south-eastern Queensland. It is a spreading shrub with overlapping lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and small white flowers arranged singly in leaf axils with 5 stamens in each flower.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMicromyrtus vernicosa is a spreading shrub that typically grows up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high and wide and has more or less drooping branchlets. It has overlapping, lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, 1.5–2.5 mm (0.059–0.098 in) long, 0.5–0.6 mm (0.020–0.024 in) wide on a petiole 0.25 mm (0.0098 in) long. The leaves are glabrous and glossy with prominent oil glands. The flowers are 1.9–2.1 mm (0.075–0.083 in) wide and arranged singly in leaf axils on a peduncle 0.5–1.0 mm (0.020–0.039 in) long, with 2 translucent bracteoles about 0.7 mm (0.028 in) long at the base. There are 5 more or less round sepals lobes 0.3–0.4 mm (0.012–0.016 in) long and 0.5–0.6 mm (0.020–0.024 in) wide, and 5 white, elliptical petals 0.8–1.0 mm (0.031–0.039 in) long and 0.6–0.7 mm (0.024–0.028 in) wide. There are 5 stamens, the filaments about 0.4 mm (0.016 in) long and the style is 0.3 mm (0.012 in) long. Flowering has been observed in May and June.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nMicromyrtus vernicosa was first formally described in 1997 by Anthony Bean in the journal Austrobaileya from specimens collected in Mount Walsh National Park. The specific epithet (vernicosa) means \"varnished\", referring to the glossy leaves.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of micromyrtus is endemic to Mount Walsh where it grows in rocky soils in heathland.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nMicromyrtus vernicosa is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jacob Bates (born March 30, 2000) is an American football placekicker for the Michigan Panthers of the United Football League (UFL). He played college soccer for Central Arkansas, and college football for Texas State and Arkansas. Bates holds the record for the longest successful UFL field goal at 64 yards. Bates has also played for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL).\n\n\n== College career ==\nBates played two seasons of college soccer at Central Arkansas in 2018 and 2019, before transferring to play college football at Texas State in 2020 where he only handled kickoffs. He transferred to Arkansas in 2022, once again only handling kickoff duties. He was named to the First-team All-SEC team in 2022.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== Houston Texans ===\nAfter going undrafted in the 2023 NFL draft, Bates signed with the Houston Texans on July 31, 2023. He was released on August 12, 2023.\n\n\n=== Michigan Panthers ===\nOn December 25, 2023, Bates signed with the Michigan Panthers of the United Football League (UFL). Bates's signing was one of several personnel decisions the league made based upon kickoff abilities (Donald De La Haye being another), as the UFL adopted a kickoff rule requiring the ball go 80 yards for a touchback, 15 yards longer than other levels of organized football. \nOn March 30, 2024, during Week 1 of the 2024 UFL season, Bates made a game-winning 64-yard field goal against the St. Louis Battlehawks, the longest field goal in the history of both the UFL and its predecessor leagues, five yards longer than the previous record set by Donny Hageman the previous year. It is tied as the second-longest recorded field goal in professional football history and the first field goal of his life; coincidentally, the lone longer kick—Justin Tucker's 66-yard kick for the Baltimore Ravens against the Detroit Lions in 2021—occurred under nearly identical circumstances and on the same field (Ford Field). Bates, who had only attempted – and missed – one field goal before in his life (in high school), had made the kick twice, the first being discarded due to the Battlehawks icing the kicker. On April 7, 2024, during week 2 of the 2024 UFL season, Bates connected on another 60+ yard field goal with a 62-yard field goal just before halftime against the Birmingham Stallions. The ball Bates kicked on the 64-yard field goal is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its \"Pro Football Today\" exhibit.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCentral Arkansas bio\nTexas State Bobcats bio\nArkansas Razorbacks bio",

        "content": "Lissanthe scabra is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a rigid, erect, branching shrub that typically grows up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high. The flowers are white and borne on a pedicel above bracteoles.\nLissanthe scabra was first formally described in 2003 by Darren Crayn and Elizabeth Brown in Australian Systematic Botany from specimens collected by Michael Hislop in 2000. The specific epithet (scabra) means \"rough\", referring to the stem.\nThis species grows on breakaways and uplands in the Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie bioregions of south-western Western Australia. It is listed as \"Priority Two\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Frances Lovell (1843–1932) was a British-born American writer, humanitarian, and temperance reformer. She co-founded the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS), and also, in 1859, the Women's Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (WPSPCA), serving as the latter's corresponding secretary and honorary president. She served as vice-president of the American Humane Association and through her work with the World Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), her humanitarian efforts were introduced into some 20 countries around the world.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMary Frances Whitechurch was born in London, England, July 11, 1843. Her father, Robert Whitechurch, was an engraver. She came to the U.S. in early 1849.\nShe was educated in American private schools.\nOn September 13, 1864, she married George S. Lovell, of Brimfield, Massachusetts, a wholesale clock dealer.\nLovell joined the WCTU at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1885. To her astonishment, she was immediately elected superintendent of the department of scientific temperance instruction in schools and colleges for the Bryn Mawr WCTU. For several years, she was actively associated with Mary H. Hunt, of the National WCTU, in her work for scientific temperance' instruction in the public schools. Due to the prolonged illness of her husband, Lovell was obliged in 1897 to resign temporarily from active WCTU work.\nFrom childhood, Lovell had a love of animals and a hatred for any sort of cruelty. While at Bryn Mawr, she became a member of the WPSPCA. Later, she became a member of the AAVS, vice-president of the American Humane Association, and associate editor of the Journal of Zoöphily.\nHer discoveries of the cruelties of vivisection aroused in Lovell a desire to advance humane education everywhere as rapidly as possible, and the thought came to her to create a Band of Mercy Department as part of the work of the WCTU. She proposed the plan in the Bryn Mawr Union, and it was successfully adopted there. She next wrote a paper entitled \"Why the Band of Mercy Should Form a Part of the work of the WCTU\", which she read at a convention of the WCTU of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It was ordered printed and was shortly published in The Union Signal, the organ of the National WCTU. At her request, the Pennsylvania WCTU created in 1888 a Department of Mercy, and at the State convention, she was elected its superintendent, having had previous experience in the same capacity for her county union. After existing for two years as a State department only, a national Department of Mercy was created, and Lovell was chosen its superintendent also. In this office, she secured the adoption of the Department of Mercy (later, the Department of Humane Education) in 44 States of the Union.\nLovell was also the World's superintendent, the Department of Mercy having been adopted by the World's convention in London in 1895. Miss Marshall Saunders of Canada, author of Beautiful Joe, was made the first superintendent, but, upon her resignation, Lovell succeeded to the position.\n Thus her humanitarian efforts were introduced into some 20 countries scattered throughout the world.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLovell resided at Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. \nIn recognition of Lovell's services in humane educational work, her portrait in oil was presented to the WPSPCA in December 1923, a gift and work of Mary J. Eddy, of Rhode Island.\nMary Frances Lovell died in Philadelphia, June 25, 1932.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"Why the Band of Mercy Should Form a Part of the work of the W.C.T.U.\"\n\"Prayer\"\n\"The Path of the Just\"\n\"The Ideal Woman\"\n\"What is Humane Education?\"\n\"Is Vivisection Philanthropy?\"\n\"The Fur Trade\"\n\"Slaughtering\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chapeuzinho Amarelo is a children's book written by musician Chico Buarque in 1970, and later becoming known for having been illustrated by cartoonist and writer Ziraldo in 1979. The book was originally dedicated to Buarque's daughters and by 2017 there had been 40 editions released.\nIt is known for being a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood addressing a story about overcoming fear. It's considered a cult classic of Brazilian children's literature, it was awarded the Highly Recommended for Children seal from the National Children's Book Foundation (FNLIJ) in 1979 and won the Jabuti award in the Illustration category in 1998.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe book tells a story in poetry form about a girl called Chapeuzinho Amarelo (lit. Little Yellow Riding Hood), a girl wearing a yellow hat who is known for being afraid of everything with her greatest fear being an imaginary wolf that she had never met and as her fears grew, the greater her fear of the wolf grew. After thinking so much about the wolf she decides to meet him, but after meeting him her fear gradually disappears until her fear for him disappears. The wolf, unhappy with seeing the girl lose her fear, decides to scare her by shouting \"I'm a wolf!\" several times, but Little Yellow laughs and ignores him until the wolf after shouting so much and reversing the syllables from lobo (wolf) to bolo (cake) turns into a cake that is afraid of being eaten by her. Little Yellow ignores the wolf and all her fears, and from then on starts to personify each creature that scares her in a different way, reversing the syllables of their names.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe book was adapted into animation in 2001 in one of the episodes of the first season of Livros Animados, which aired on the Futura.\nOn January 12, 2019, an animated series titled Chapeuzinho de Todas as Cores (lit. Little All-Colors Riding Hood) premiered on Saturday mornings on TV Cultura with just one season with 13 7-minute episodes produced by the animation studio Animaking.\nAdaptations of the book in the form of plays have also occurred over the years.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book was listed as one of the best children's books to help children deal with fears in addition to being praised for its humorous narrative adapting the original fairy tale.\nThe illustrations made by Ziraldo have been the target of critical praise, considering that his arts helped to better interpret Buarque's story, being awarded for best illustration in 1998. Because of this, the book is considered one of Ziraldo's main works, who would later be known for writing more children's books throughout his career.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChapeuzinho Amarelo (PDF)",

        "content": "The Hotel Maury is a three-star hotel located at the corners of Carabaya and Ucayali streets in the historic centre of Lima, Peru. It is considered one of the oldest hotels in both Peru and the Pacific coast.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hotel was inaugurated in 1835. Founded by the French merchant Pedro Maury, it was created as an inn for travelers passing through Lima. It is located in block 3 of Jirón Carabaya, one block from the capital's main square.\nThanks to the fact that its property passed into the hands of the Chilean named Lecaros, the hotel was not looted during the occupation of Lima by the army of that country, when Peru faced Chile in the War of the Pacific.\nIts ownership was transferred to Antonio Bergna after its purchase. In 1954 the 45-room building was demolished and the reconstruction was carried out by local architect Héctor Velarde and the engineer Adolfo Carozzo. The new building has five storeys. It was later remodelled again and reopened in February 2000.\n\n\n=== Bar and restaurant ===\nThe hotel's bar and restaurant were popular for their cuisine and service. The owners also owned the restaurant in the Park of the Exhibition, the Jardín del Camal, and the Ancón hotel.\nThe hotel bar became known for its pisco sour. The drink was invented in the Bar Morris (in the Calle Boza), but the recipe was improved in the bar of this hotel. Also in the original establishment, another pisco-based cocktail was created, the Ponche de los libertadores. It is, together with the Gran Hotel Bolívar and the Casa Tambo, part of the \"Pisco Sour route in the Centre of Lima.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGran Hotel Bolívar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blessing Shine Agbomadzi (born 11 June 2001) is a Ghanaian professional footballer, who plays as a defender for AS FAR in the Moroccan Women's Championship, and the Ghana women's national football team. She represented Ghana at the U17, U20 levels and the senior team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nAgbomadzi started her career with Kumasi Sports Academy Ladies before joining Sea Lions. She played for Sea Lions in the Ghana Women's Premier League. In October 2020, she joined Israeli top-flight side, Hapoel Be'er Sheva on a two-year deal. Her time at Hapoel Be'er Sheva was cut short abruptly as it lasted only a season, due to the conflict between Israel and Palestine which spanned for months.\nAgbomadzi returned to Ghana and subsequently joined Hasaacas Ladies ahead of the maiden CAF Women's Champions League. She played in all matches and formed a strong centre-back partnership with Janet Egyir, helping Hasaacas Ladies to reach the final of the 2021 CAF Women's Champions League. They however lost to Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies by 2–0 in the 2021 CAF Women's Champions League final. In her only season (2021–22 season) with Hasaacas, she played in 17 out of 19 league matches with Hasaacas finishing the season as Southern Zone Champions but losing the championship final to Ampem Darkoa Ladies. She was nominated for the Defender of the Year award.\nIn September 2022, Agbomadzi joined Moroccan Women's Championship club AS FAR on a two-year contract. In her first season with the club, she won the 2022 CAF Women's Champions League where she played in all matches, including the final which AS FAR won by 4–0 against defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies. The following season, she won a double, winning the Moroccan Women's Championship and Moroccan Women Throne Cup trophies. She also helped AS FAR to win place third in the 2023 CAF Women's Champions League defeating Ampem Darkoa Ladies by 2–0. As a result of that, she became the first player to win all three medals in the CAF Women's Champions League.\n\n\n== International career ==\nAgbomadzi played for the Ghana U-17 women's team, the Black Maidens. In 2016, she was a member of the team that played at the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals. She played alongside Sandra Owusu-Ansah, Nina Norshie and Vivian Adjei.\nIn 2018, Agbomadzi was a member of the Ghana U-20 women's team, the Black Princesses and was part of the squad that played at the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup coached by Yusif Basigi. In August 2020, she was also part of the 31 players who were invited to the Black Princesses camp ahead of the 2020 FIFA U-20 World Cup qualifying matches. In late October 2020, FIFA announced that the 2020 edition of the tournament had been cancelled.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nHasaacas Ladies\n\nCAF Women's Champions League runner-up: 2021\nGhana Women's Super Cup: 2021\nFirst Lady's Cup: 2021\nAS FAR\n\nCAF Women's Champions League: 2022\nMoroccan Women's Championship: 2022–23\nMoroccan Women Throne Cup: 2023\nIndividual\n\nGhana Football Awards Women's Footballer of the Year: 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlessing Agbomadzi at Global Sports Archive\nBlessing Agbomadzi at Soccerway",

        "content": "Veracruz Church (Spanish: Iglesia de la Veracruz) is a Roman Catholic church under the invocation of the \"Vera Cruz\" or Holy Cross. It is located in the center of the city of Medellín, Colombia, on the western side of the Plazuela de la Veracruz. It is the only colonial church in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1682, Captain Juan Céspedes de Hinestroza began the construction (at the site of the current church of La Veracruz) of a chapel or hermitage on land purchased from Mr. Luis Acevedo Rides. However, when the walls had advanced to a height of a few meters, the work was suspended.\nIn 1712, Captain Céspedes formed a committee among Europeans and foreigners to establish the Brotherhood of N. S. de los Milagros, and in the first session, it was resolved to request authorization from the Bishop of Popayán to finalize the hermitage, to whose jurisdiction the entire province of Antioquia belonged.\nThe Governor of Antioquia, Francisco Baraya y Campa, also granted permission. At that time, permits from both civil and ecclesiastical authorities were necessary to build churches, chapels, or hermitages for public worship.\nDue to the great dedication of the president of the committee, Captain Céspedes, who fought to give it a quick completion, and with the help of some wealthy and wealthy foreigners residing in Medellín, the hermitage was completed in January 1713.\nThe church came to be called the hermitage of La Veracruz de los Forasteros, which served as a cemetery for foreigners, in addition to hosting masses and also serving to deposit the Holy Sepulcher during Holy Week and for the processions of the greater litanies, following the example of the hermitages in the city of Antioquia.\nIn March 1791, it was threatened with ruin, so it was completely demolished, and reconstruction began on December 26 of that same year. The Spanish resident Don José Peinado Ruiz invested large sums of money in the reconstruction of this significant work, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1803. Chronicles recount that this gentleman, for the day of the inauguration, decorated the entire church with carnations, roses, and lilies brought from Rionegro, and to the surprise of the crowd, he watered the entire church floor with cologne water. Its master builders were José Ortiz, Joaquín Gómez, and José Peinado himself. The blessing of the current Church of La Veracruz, of a popular Baroque style, took place on March 26, 1809, by the priest Alberto María de la Calle, who blessed and dedicated the work to priestly and religious service.\nSince then, La Veracruz has been a support point for the worship of the Church of La Candelaria, mainly in 1826 and 1850 when it was closed for renovations, and for this reason, the funeral of Monsignor Juan de la Cruz Gómez Plata, Bishop of Antioquia, who died in this city on December 1, 1850, was held at La Veracruz. In 1868, it had to serve as the Parish of the cathedral, due to the new designation of La Candelaria, upon the creation of the Diocese.\nIn 1883, La Veracruz was the second parish in the urban area of Medellín. It is said that one of its bells was used by the Sage Francisco José de Caldas to make a cannon destined for Independence.\nIn 1968, the plaza was remodeled, and the columns of hematites were placed, along with the first bronze fountain that Medellín had. The monument to Atanasio Girardot, a work by Francisco Antonio Cano, was also remodeled. In 1976, Father Celedonio Arismendi decorated all the altars with fine gold and retouched the images in the same metal. Father Gabriel Escobar had already built the rectory, adjacent to the church and facing the plaza.\nIt was declared a cultural heritage of the nation on March 12, 1982. Today its façade can be seen in white color, and it was restored by the Ferrocarril de Antioquia Foundation.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBronx, Humberto (1984). La veracruz de Medellín.

        "content": "Rainforest is the debut extended play (EP) by American musician Clams Casino, released on June 27, 2011, through Tri Angle Records. Initially known as a rap producer, Volpe's backing music started being listened to by electronic music fans after the release of his Instrumentals mixtape in March. For the Rainforest EP, he chose five instrumentals that had been rejected by rappers.\n\n\n== Background and production ==\nClams Casino, real name Michael Volpe, started producing music seriously in 2007. He soon began producing for rappers over the Internet, including Lil B, Havoc and Soulja Boy. After fans requested that Volpe release instrumental versions of the songs he had produced, he released the Instrumentals mixtape in March 2011. Volpe reported that, following the release, he started being seen as an artist in his own right instead of a rap producer. He said that the more \"textured\" music he was making started being listened to by electronic music fans, while rappers were rejecting to rap over it. These rejected instrumentals appeared in Rainforest; he reinforced in a press release that, unlike the Instrumentals mixtape, Rainforest's songs always existed as instrumentals.\nVolpe wanted to make the extended play (EP) similar to the Instrumentals mixtape. While he had a lot of music he wanted to release, including all these tracks in the album would make it feel less cohesive; he instead chose five \"really strong\" tracks.\nFor the EP, Volpe signed with Tri Angle Records. He said that after releasing Instrumentals, someone sent the mixtape to the label, who messaged Volpe on Twitter. Volpe was surprised that the label's sound was similar to his work and accepted their offer. In May 2011, Volpe's computer stopped working, and, since he did not have a backup, he lost all his files, which amounted to four years of work. Volpe noted in an interview with DMY that, had he delayed the completion of the EP for a few days, \"it wouldn't have happen[ed] at all!\".\n\n\n== Composition ==\nSteve Shaw of Fact wrote that Rainforest saw Volpe pursuing \"a clipped kind of Amazonian industrial\" sound, contrary to rap's usual \"straighter structures\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"garbled and maddening and also intoxicating, full of coughs, skitters, striated vocal samples and groaning, morbid bass\", with the bass being \"unusually thick, almost catastrophe-level\", \"[moving] with force while he spreads out decidedly pretty and melodic samples atop it\".\nRandall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Treetop\" \"is a National Geographic acid trip: bird songs, frog croaks and insect crackles funneled through hot springs\" and \"Gorilla\" \"sounds like a '90s trip-hop track stuck in quicksand\". Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork compared the latter to the Instrumentals track \"Motivation\", though calling \"Gorilla\" more introspective.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\nVolpe announced the EP on April 14, with Pitchfork premiering the track \"Gorilla\". After being available for streaming weeks earlier, Rainforest was released worldwide on June 27, 2011, in download, CD and vinyl formats; it was the first official release by Volpe. According to review aggregator Metacritic, Rainforest received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 from 6 critics scores.\nIn September 2014, SL Jones rapped over Rainforest. On February 27, 2019, Volpe released a deluxe edition. In his 2017 book Sonic Intimacy, Dominic Pettman wrote: \"Staying in the realm of hip-hop, [the EP] is an especially rich sonic line of inspiration for using technology to elicit or engineer the vanishing voice(s) of endangered environments and habitats.\" In 2020, \"Treetop\", \"Drowning\", and \"Gorilla\" were remastered for Volpe's compilation Instrumental Relics. That same year, Noah Yoo of Pitchfork named Rainforest one of Tri Angle Records' most essential albums, writing that \"the crushed soundscapes of Rainforest showed the brilliance Clams was capable of when he flew solo\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "La Guerre (fr. 'The War') is an oil-on-canvas artwork created in 1894 by the renowned French painter Henri Rousseau. It stands as one of his most celebrated pieces, recognized for its profound impact and significance within his body of work.\n\n\n== Description and Interpretation ==\nIn the center, a fierce and armed woman holds a sword and a torch. This Bellona-like figure, the Roman goddess of war, rides a horse that resembles more of a hybrid monster. The horse in the painting contrasts with that in La Carriole du Père Junier: black, wild, and bristling, representing the brute force of war. With the armed and wild woman atop it, it suggests that war brings about primitiveness. The lower part of the painting shows the effects of war: corpses that serve as the prey for crows. The bare trees and broken branches create a landscape of desolation and allude to death, even though the pink clouds and blue sky fail to convey the drama of the scene. The composition is pyramidal, with the corpses at the base, and the horse and woman above.\n\n\n== History ==\nMore than twenty years after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris Commune of 1871, Rousseau, still marked by these events, painted La Guerre.\nThe canvas was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1894. La Guerre was received either with sarcasm, due to its clumsy appearance, or with enthusiasm, because of its complete stylistic independence. The young painter Louis Roy wrote in Le Mercure de France: \"This display may have seemed strange because it did not evoke any idea of something already seen. Isn't that a major quality? He [Rousseau] has the rare merit nowadays of being absolutely personal. He is striving towards a new art...\".\nThe painting has been housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1986.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"La Guerre (Henry Rousseau) Musée d'Orsay\".

        "content": "The Arthur Rank Centre is an ecumenical national charity which provides resources, training, and advocacy for rural Christians, rural churches and the communities they serve, across England and Wales. It was originally based at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire. before moving, and is now to be found in Barford, near Warwick. \nIt was established in 1972 shortly after the death of the benefactor and film producer J. Arthur Rank, who had been an active methodist teaching at Sunday schools.\nThe Arthur Rank Centre serves both the spiritual and practical needs of the rural community through hundreds of resources for rural churches, including a comprehensive range of worship resources and rural stories, ideas and inspiration. It has run a highly popular training course called \"The Rural Mission and Ministry Course\" for over 40 years, along with a more in-depth \"Germinate Leadership\"  programme to develop rural church leaders across all Christian denominations. \nMany charities have been formed and supported within the pool of the Arthur Rank Centre, including \n\nThe Rural Housing Trust,\nThe Farming Community Network (in partnership with the Agricultural Christian Fellowship),\nThe Rural Stress Information Network (now a part of FCN),\nThe National Churches Tourism Group,\nThe Addington Fund,\nThe Centre for Studies in Rural Ministry,\nEco-Congregation - now Eco-Church run by A Rocha,\nComputers for Rural People, and\nThe National Care Farming Initiative later to become Care Farming UK and now Social Farms and Gardens (in association with Harper Adams University & The University of Essex)\n\nThere have been various CEO's for the charity including Revd Dr Gordon Gatward (1999-2013) awarded an OBE for services to the Farming communities, and later a Lifetime Achievement award from Farmers Weekly, Jerry Marshall (2013-2018), Revd Claire Maxim (2018-2022) and presently Revd Matt Jeffrey (2022-).\nFor many years, the Anglican, Methodist and URC National Rural officers were based within the charity. Most recently, these posts ceased, aside from Rural Mission and Ministry Officer for the Methodist Church.\nResources are produced regularly\nFor many years, the charity produced a paid for magazine known as Country Way. In 2023, this switched to an online offering known as Country Way news and can be received free of charge..\nIt is also a member of the Rural Coalition along with 13 other national charities and organisations.\n\n\n== References ==",

With its victory over Jones County in the Junior Rose Bowl, Compton was acknowledged as the junior college national champion.\nHalfback Jim Waddell set the school's single game rushing record with 317 yards, scored 107 points, and ranked with the school's all-time rushing and scoring leaders (and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees), Hugh McElhenny and Joe Perry.\nCompton placed five players on the first team of the 1955 All-Western State Conference football team: Jim Waddell and Lee Mack at back; Jack Atwood at center; Dick Long at guard; and David Main at tackle. Four others were named to the second team: Bunny Aldrich at back; Marvin Perz at guard; Joe Lewis at tackle; and Charles McNeil at end. Lee Mack scored nine touchdowns in the first eight games of the season, but missed the remainder of the season after fracturing his hip in the game against Glendale.\nThe team played its home games at Ramsaur Stadium in Compton, California.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia pentapogona is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a diffuse shrub with many erect or ascending branchlets, crowded egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves about 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long, with a small point on the tip. The flowers are borne in lower leaf axils and are sessile with very small bracts and bracteoles less than 2 mm (0.079 in) long at the base. The petals are joined at the base forming a tube about 6.5 mm (0.26 in) long with bearded lobes.\nStyphelia pentapogona was first formally described in 1867 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected by George Maxwell.\nThis styphelia is found in the Esperance Plains and Mallee bioregions of south-western Western Australia and is listed as \"not threatened\". \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Palau does not recognise same-sex marriage, civil unions or any other form of recognition for same-sex couples.\n\n\n== Legal history ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nHomosexuality in Palau has historically been taboo, and society generally does not accept same-sex relationships. Same-sex sexual relations were prohibited in Palau until a new penal code was enacted in 2014. Christianity, introduced to Palau in the 19th century, has also shaped societal perception, leading LGBT people to experience social marginalisation and discrimination today.\n\n\n=== Constitutional ban ===\nThe Constitution of Palau has defined marriage as between \"a man and a woman\" since 2008. The constitutional ban was among the 22 amendments passed during the November 4, 2008 referendum. Previously, the Constitution did not address same-sex marriage or marriage explicitly. Article IV, Section 13 of the Constitution was amended to read:\n\nThe government shall provide for marital and related parental rights, privileges and responsibilities on the basis of equality between men and women, mutual consent and cooperation. All marriages contracted within the Republic of Palau shall be between a man and a woman. Parents or individuals acting in the capacity of parents shall be legally responsible for the support and for the unlawful conduct of their minor children as prescribed by law.\nIn July 2019, in response to a question at a weekly press conference, President Tommy Remengesau Jr. said he supported striking down the ban, saying he believes in \"full equality\" and branding it discriminatory. \"Those who are different doesn't mean that they should be outcast, second class citizens, or that they can't contribute to the community. So I want to make it clear that I don't believe in the constitutional amendment that promote[s] discrimination. I want it to be on record that I support the rights of each individual, any Palauan, to be treated equally... Let us treat each other with respect and dignity. This won't be positive for us at the UN level as the trend worldwide is opening up to these individual rights, but we are taking a step backward.\", he said. He finished his statements with \"as long as they believe in God like everyone else, we can treat each other with respect and dignity\". Local activists applauded his comments, calling it a \"very surprising and progressive act\".\n\n\n=== Statutory laws ===\n\nIn February 2014, a bill was introduced to the Senate of Palau to define marriage in the National Code as being between \"a man and a woman\" in order to give statutory effect to the new constitutional definition of marriage. The bill passed its first reading in May 2014, but eventually did not pass the National Congress. The Kaleidoscope Australia Human Rights Foundation (KHRF) considered that if enacted, the bill would have \"further entrench[ed] discrimination against same-sex couples in Palauan law\". Palau also does not recognize civil unions, which would provide same-sex couples a subset of the rights and benefits of marriage. The KHRF reported in 2016 that the constitutional definition of marriage \"[does] not hinder the ability of the National Congress to legislate for other forms of relationship recognition\". At Palau's second Universal Periodic Review on 21 January 2016, Spain recommended the government to legalize same-sex marriage. The government \"noted\" (rejected) these recommendations.\nThe National Code does not expressly forbid same-sex marriages, but its provisions on marriages between two non-citizens or between a citizen and a non-citizen state that the \"the male\" must be at least 18 years of age and \"the female\" at least 16 years of age.\nPalau law does not expressly ban the recognition of same-sex marriages validly performed abroad, but an attempt to register an overseas same-sex marriage was denied in 2014. This refusal was not pursued in court. A 2023 government report recommended allowing same-sex couples married abroad to be recognized and allow surviving spouses to access insurance social security benefits. The report, which according to Vice President Uduch Sengebau Senior can serve as \"valuable resource for informed-decision making and policy formulation\", also noted that the \"LGBT community in Palau supports the removal of the constitutional provision against same-sex marriage\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBT rights in Palau\nRecognition of same-sex unions in Oceania\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

She belonged to what was known as the Brazilian branch of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family.\nShe had learning difficulties. In 1938 her family decided to place her in an institution.  She was killed at the Hartheim killing centre as part of the Nazi Aktion T4 program.  There are questions about whether her relatives, who included Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, did anything to protect her.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nAlan R.

        "content": "The Casa del Pueblo (Spanish: House of the People) is a building that serves as the main headquarters of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, a political party in Peru. In addition to its political functions, it also provides social services, incling education, healthcare and soup kitchen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Party was originally headquartered at 1065 Belén Street, near the Plaza San Martín. Since 1948, the Central Command of the Peruvian Aprista Party has been in the city of Lima and is located in an old house which originally housed the Hipólito Unanue School, in Alfonso Ugarte Avenue. It was acquired after an intense partisan collection under the influence of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre himself. This property is a historical symbol of the Aprista Party and its facilities are also part of the places used by union members to report on their work.\nThe building was targeted by a number of administrations, such as in 1992, during the government of Alberto Fujimori, who ordered a military intervention.\nFrom April 17 to 19, 2019, the funeral of former APRA president Alan García was held in the building.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe two-storey building is located in Lima District, on an avenue nicknamed the \"Avenue of the White Handkerchiefs\", as a popular recognition of the presence of the APRA in the Peruvian capital, in allusion to the APRA ritual of greeting its leaders with white handkerchiefs, a symbol of their loyalty and brotherhood.\nThe building has several rooms and a large \"Aula Magna\", where it says: \"Only God will save my soul and only Aprism will save Peru.\" In the main building, on the first floor is the Headquarters, where Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre listened to the people, and the National Policy Directorate. On the second floor are the offices of the Party Presidency, the General Secretariat, the General Management and the Moral Ethics Court.\nNear the patio are the classrooms of the National School of Oratory (Spanish: Escuela Nacional de Oratoria) and also the Antenor Orrego Pre-University Academy (Spanish: Academia Preuniversitaria Antenor Orrego), named in honor of the APRA philosopher.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican Popular Revolutionary Alliance\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Laz nationalism is a form of nationalism that asserts the belief that the Laz people are a nation and promotes the Laz identity. The movement mainly asserts that the Laz people are an independent nation, distinct from Turks, and distinct but related to Georgians. Many also advocate for the independence of Lazistan, and have been tried in court for it.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLaz nationalism, like Kurdish nationalism, also emerged as a reaction to Turkish nationalism and Turkification policies that indirectly banned Laz culture, changed Laz city names, prohibited the Laz language, and resettled the Laz people in places determined by the government. The existence of the Laz as an ethnic group was also denied by Turkish nationalists. In 1993, a book titled \"History of the Laz\", which claimed that the Laz were a Kartvelian people, boosted nationalist sentiments.\n\n\n== History ==\nStudies on the Laz people, culture, and language started during the reign of Abdul Hamid II. Hopalı Faik Efendi was the first person to publish a book about the Laz in that time, and his book was burned and he was sentenced to prison. In March 1919, Ahmet Tevfik Yücesoy founded the \"Laz Tekamül-i Milli Cemiyeti\", which was a regionalist organization which aimed to establish cooperation between the Laz.In 1984, the Laz nationalist movement revived with the efforts of Germany-based Laz activists such as Fahri Kahraman and Selma Koçiva, who produced the only Laz-language works of that period with the book Nananena [Motherland] and two magazines (Parpali [Butterfly] (1984), Lazuri Ambarepe [Laz News] (1992) magazines. Some Turkish sources claimed that the Laz are Turks and that the German Federal Intelligence Service tried to brainwash them with the \"Caucasian Culture Ring\" theory.Many Laz living in Georgia also hold nationalist sentiments, and call on the Laz in Turkey to resist Turkification.In 1993, Laz nationalism started to experience its strongest times. In 1992, the book written by Laz activists from Georgia, Muhammed Vanilishi and Ali Tandilava, was translated into Turkish under the name \"History of the Laz\". In 1994, the Civiyazıları Publishing House was founded by Özcan Sapan, who aimed to do publishing activities on the Laz. In 1992, a Laz rock music group called Zuğaşi Berepe was established. Together with Zuğaşi Berepe, the Laz cultural movement was noticed by the young people. In 1997, Birol Topaloğlu released his music album consisting of Laz songs called Heyamo. He was arrested for separatism for releasing an album.The Laz Cultural Association was established in 2008 and the Laz Institute was established in 2013. Mehmet Bekaroğlu, the then president of the Laz Institute, stated that the only goal of the institute was to prevent the extinction of the Laz language and Kartvelian studies.\n\n\n== Today ==\nToday, many Laz nationalists believe that the Laz cultural and political movement is being ignored and that the Kurdish Political Movement in Turkey has more attention. However, like the Laz movement has similar demands as the Kurdish movement, which include reinstating native city names, and official recognition as a minority people and language. Turkish author Hale Yılmaz stated that the Laz nationalist movement has the potential to turn into an open conflict with the Turkish state in the future.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeorgian nationalism\n\n\n== References ==",

It was invented in the 1950s, and first identified by forensic laboratories as a designer drug in 2020, though anecdotal reports suggest it may have emerged earlier than this. It is similar in structure to the potent designer stimulant drug alpha-PVP but with the propyl side chain replaced by a phenyl ring, and while it is less potent than alpha-PVP itself, Alpha-D2PV is still a reasonably potent stimulant and has been known to cause poisoning when misrepresented as less potent drugs such as MDMA. While it is also similar in structure to the dissociative drug diphenidine, Alpha-D2PV appears to produce only stimulant effects.\n\n\n== See also ==\nα-PCYP\nβk-Ephenidine\nIPPV\nFluorolintane\nLefetamine\nZylofuramine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Boat Race 2024 was a series of side-by-side rowing races in London which took place on 30 March 2024.\nHeld annually, The Boat Race is contested between crews from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, usually along a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) tidal stretch of the River Thames, known as the Tideway, in south-west London. This was the 78th women's race and the 169th men's race.  Cambridge led the longstanding rivalry 86–81 and 47–30 in the men's and women's races, respectively.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Boat Race is an annual side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\"). First held in 1829, the race usually takes place on the 4.2-mile (6.8 km) Championship Course, between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in south-west London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; the race is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe crews for both men's and women's boats were announced earlier in March 2024 at Battersea Power Station. The women's race was umpired by Richard Phelps and the men's race was umpired by former Olympian Matthew Pinsent.Cambridge retained their title as winners of the Women's Boat Race for the seventh consecutive year, 7 lengths ahead of rivals Oxford. This took the overall record in the women's race to 48–30 to Cambridge. Cambridge beat the Oxford men by 31⁄2 lengths in a time of 18 m 56 s in a tense encounter, resulting in the head-to-head record being 87–81 to Cambridge. Oxford women's boat Osiris won the women's reserves race. Cambridge's Goldie won the men's reserves race. Cambridge's men and women secured victory in the The Lightweight Boat Races.The race was broadcast internationally on television. Fox News, CNN, The New York Times, CBS and other international media organisations ran stories about the poor water quality in the Thames, specifically citing excrement in the water during the race. Thames Water said improving river health was a \"key focus\" for the company, which recently completed the Thames Tideway Tunnel super sewer to stop sewage overflows and improve water quality in the Thames.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhammad ibn Ali al-Khalanji or Ibrahim al-Khaliji or Muhammad ibn al-Khalij (Egyptian Arabic: محمد بن الخليج; possibly d. 905 AD) was one of the senior commanders of the Tulunid dynasty, who rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate after the fall of the Tulunid emirate.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was an Egyptian officer born in the Bay of Fustat and that's where the name \"ibn al-Khalji\" come from.\nIbn al-Khalij was one of the junior officers in a section of the Egyptian Tulunid army headed by Commander Safi al-Rumi, and there is not sufficient information about his upbringing or activity at that time.\n\n\n== Restoration of Independence ==\nAfter the fall of the Tulunid dynasty and the entry of the Abbasid armies into Egypt, the Abbasids committed crimes against humanity against Egyptians, whether soldiers or civilians. The historian Ibn Taghribirdi says about that incident: “They attacked the homes of the people, plundered them, took their money, violated their harems, took the virgins, and did to the Egyptians what they would not do to the infidels.”When the Abbasids first entered Egypt, they disbanded the Egyptian army and captured all the remaining officers and soldiers who remained from the last battle to defend the capital at that time, al-Qata'i, and sent them in batches to Baghdad. In one of these batches, there was an Egyptian officer named Mahammad bin al-Khalij or Mahammad bin Ali al-Khalanji.\nOn the way to Baghdad, the officer, Mahammad ibn al-Khalij, conspires with the captured officers, specifically with the Egyptian officer, Shafi’ al-Lulu’i. Thousands of Egyptian soldiers are liberated and attack the Abbasid soldiers. They are freed from captivity and return to Egypt.\nOn the way to the Egyptian army liberating Egypt, they entered the city of Ramla in Palestine and defeated the Abbasid army there, whose leader was Wasif bin Sawartkin the Younger. There in Ramla, Emir Mahammad bin al-Khalij ordered the proclamation in the minbars (pulpits) that Egypt had become independent again and that the state of Banu Tulun had returned. After that, the Egyptian army moved under the leadership of Ibn al-Khalij, and at Gaza they were met by the Abbasid army stationed in Egypt The Egyptian army won a landslide victory, then moved towards Arish and defeated the Abbasid garrison there, then to Farma and defeated the Abbasids there.\nAfter that, the Abbasid governor of Egypt, Isa al-Nushari, prepared a very large army and met the Egyptian army at Bilbeis in Sharqia. There the Egyptians won another decisive victory, and the road to the Egyptian capital, Fustat, was opened. As for the Abbasid governor al-Nushari, who heard of the defeat of the Abbasid army, he fled from Fustat with the remains of his commanders.\nAfter that, the victorious Egyptian army, led by Ibn al-Khalij, entered the city of Fustat. The Egyptian people received the army with ululations and celebrations and prayed for Ibn al-Khalij from the pulpits of the mosques after the Abbasid Caliph and Ibrahim bin Khumarawayh (the last Tulunid prince captured in Baghdad).\n\n\n== Ruling Egypt ==\nIbn al-Khalij worked to calm things down and eliminate the chaos in Egypt. Dr. Wafa Mahammad Ali says in his book “Pages from the History of the Abbasids صفحات من تاريخ العباسيين” that Ibn al-Khalij's entry into Fustat restored hope that the Tulunid state would soon return again, and the Egyptians were very happy with great joy due to the intensity of their love for the dynasty and the glory days of Egypt and its independence during their reign.\nWhen Ibn al-Khalij entered Fustat, the Egyptians decorated themselves and the streets with saffron, and the barbers came and washed and shaved the hair of Ibn al-Khalij's horse.\nIbn al-Khalij settled in the city of Fustat after he was confident that his rule was stable in Fustat and the Delta. Ibn al-Khalij ordered the necessity of the official return of the Egyptian army and the opening of the door to volunteering for all Egyptians. People came to him from all over Egypt to volunteer for his army, to the point that the Egyptian army under his rule became fifty thousand, which was a large number at the time.\nAfter that, al-Khalanji still wanted to get rid of the Abbasid presence as quickly as possible, so he ordered a commander named Khafif al-Nubi to eliminate the remnants of the Abbasids in Egypt. Indeed, the Abbasids fled from the first time they heard of the Egyptian army's movement from Fustat, and they were forced to flee to Alexandria, then to the village of Turuja in Beheira, and there the Abbasids set a trap for Commander Khafif. Khafif who fell into the trap was forced to withdraw to Fustat. The remnants of the Abbasids fled to Upper Egypt, led by the former governor of Egypt, Isa al-Nushari.\n\n\n== Fall ==\nAt that time, the Abbasid Caliphate sent land and sea forces to support al-Nushari, by land under the leadership of Abu al-Az Khalifa bin Mubarak al-Sulami, and by sea under the leadership of Damian of Tarsus. Thus, the situation became dangerous for Ibn al-Khalanji in front of the Abbasid Caliphate's army and fleet coming from the north, and the army of Isa al-Nushari coming from the south in Upper Egypt.\nBut Ibn al-Khalanji was not shaken for a moment and was determined to fight the Abbasids until his last breath, so he went out to meet the army that came from outside at Arish. The Egyptian army, led by Ibn al-Khalanji, was victorious in the Battle of al-Arish in the year 293 AH. In this battle, a large number of Abbasid soldiers were captured. After that, Ibn al-Khalij found another Abbasid army coming by land under the command of Fatik al-Mutaddi by land, and Damian's forces by sea.\nAfter that, Ibn al-Khalij found another Abbasid army coming by land under the command of Fatik al-Mu'tadidi by land, and Damian's forces by sea. Indeed, Ibn al-Khalanji defeated Fatik and his army more than once, but unfortunately, the last time, Ibn al-Khalanji was defeated at Beni Suef after valiant resistance.\nAfter that, Ibn al-Khalanji was forced to withdraw to Fustat, and at that time the Abbasid fleet entered under the leadership of Damian, and al-Khalanji saw that he was beginning to be effectively defeated in the war, and his position was worsened by the worsening conditions in Egypt due to the large number of wars, to the point of rising prices.\nIn the end, the Abbasids entered Fustat by land and sea, and Ibn al-Khalanji was forced, with regret, to hide in the house of a foreign man named Trik, but this man reported him to the Abbasids, so Mahammad Ibn al-Khalij was arrested and sent to Baghdad, along with his closest followers, after he ruled Egypt for nearly a year, specifically seven months and twenty-two days. There, he and his companions were tortured in Baghdad, and the Abbasid Caliph ordered them to be slandered over camels, then he ordered his killing, in order to thus end this temporarily successful attempt to restore the Tulunid state, which cost Ibn al-Khalanji the lives of him and many Egyptians.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBianquis, Thierry (1998). \"Autonomous Egypt from Ibn Ṭūlūn to Kāfūr, 868–969\".

The book won the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel and was a 2001 August Derleth Award nominee.\nThe novel is a tribute to H. P. Lovecraft.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe novel tells story about Ned Dunstan, a computer programmer with an odd past that he finds himself constantly questioning. Every year on his birthday, Ned is cursed with visions of horror committed by a savage figure he calls \"Mr. X.\" Now, as his 35th birthday approaches, Ned has been drawn back to his home town of Edgerton, Illinois, by a premonition that his mother is dying. His mother reveals the identity of his mysterious father and warns him of grave danger. Ignoring the warnings, Ned explores his dark past and the astonishing legacy of his kin, driving the case to a sinister turn as it appears he may or may not have a devious doppelgänger responsible for gruesome murders. Soon, Ned is accused of crimes he couldn't possibly have committed, while he enters a hidden world of ominous mysteries, where he must confront his deepest nightmares.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The University Interscholastic League Academic Contests, also known as UIL Academics, is a series of academic contests offered by the University Interscholastic League in the state of Texas. At the High School level, 30 contests are offered. At the Middle and Elementary School levels, 20 contests are offered. The UIL estimates that more than half a million students participate in its competitions in a given year.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1910, the University of Texas at Austin created the extension department to sponsor Academic contests. At the request of the Texas State Teachers Association, this initial organization, then known as the Debating League of Texas High Schools, held its first state championship meet. Sixty students from ten schools participated in a forerunner to today's Cross-Examination Debate. El Paso High School won the inaugural state championship, in 1911. In 1913, the Debating League of Texas voted to merge with the Interscholastic Athletic Association (which sponsored the inaugural Track & Field meet in 1911) and formed the University Interscholastic League.\nThe league grew rapidly, and some changes where made. In 1918, the UIL excluded private schools from membership, a rule which largely remains in effect today (the exceptions, of course, being that Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas and Strake Jesuit College Preparatory where allowed admission after extensive litigation). In 1920, a team of girls from Mathis High School won the state championship, prompting the league to separate Boy's and Girl's competition. Also in 1920, Prairie View A&M University began the sponsorship of the Prairie View Interscholastic League (PVIL), a UIL alternative for students of color, as the UIL limited its membership to white schools only. Beginning in 1956, the PVIL and the UIL merged into one organization, retaining the UIL name.\nIn 1945, the UIL created separate conferences for schools of different sizes for the first time, Conference AA for large schools and Conference A for small schools. This temporarily ended gender segregation in debate. In 1947, gender segregation was re-introduced in debate in Conference AA and Conference A was renamed Conference AB. In 1948, Conference AB was disbanded, a City Conference was created for urban schools, and Conference A and Conference B where created for smaller schools. All except Conference B had gender segregation in debate. This structure continued until 1951, when the City Conference was disbanded. In 1959, two new Conferences for Large Schools, Conference AAA and Conference AAAA, where created. Gender segregation existed in both conferences, although Conference A ended its gender segregation. In 1974, all conferences had gender segregation. In 1975, gender segregation in debate ended permanently. In 1981, Conference nomenclature changed, and Conference B became Conference A, and all Conferences will the letter \"A\" adding an additional A. This five conference system would remain the same until 2014–2015, when Conference AAAAAA was created. In 2020, all events except Congressional Debate where cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Congressional Debate, which holds their state championship in January, was already over before the pandemic began in March).\n\n\n== Contests offered ==\n\nAccounting\nCalculator Applications\nComputer Applications (individual competition only)\nComputer Science\nCurrent Issues and Events\nLiterary Criticism\nMathematics\nNumber Sense\nReady Writing (individual competition only)\nScience\nSocial Studies\nSpelling and Vocabulary\nSpeech (an award is given to the top overall school in speech events; the award does not qualify students for advancement)\nCross-Examination Team Debate (team competition only)\nLincoln-Douglas Debate (individual competition only)\nCongressional Debate (individual competition only)\nExtemporaneous Informative Speaking (individual competition only)\nExtemporaneous Persuasive Speaking (individual competition only)\nPoetry Interpretation (individual competition only)\nProse Interpretation (individual competition only)\nJournalism (an award is given to the top overall school in journalism events; the award does not qualify students for advancement)\nEditorial Writing (individual competition only)\nFeature Writing (individual competition only)\nHeadline Writing (individual competition only)\nNews Writing (individual competition only)\nOne-Act Play (team competition plus individual awards that do not lead to advancement) (List of Previous Texas UIL One Act Play Winners)\n\n\n== Structure and notable rules ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nFor all competitions excluding Congressional Debate, the first round of competition is the district level. To advance from district to region, a student must either place top three in their event, be a part of a district champion team, or have their team earn a wild card bid. The first-place finishers in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics (subsections of the Science event) also advance to Region. Advancement from Region to State works similarly.\nIn Cross-Examination Debate, the top two teams advance directly from district to state. After a day of preliminary rounds, the top sixteen teams in each conference advance to a single elimination bracket to determine a state champion.\nIn Congressional Debate, the boundaries of the state's twenty Educational Service Centers are used as opposed to districts determined by the league. The top three students from each region in each conference advance to state, although an additional competitor may advance for each ten students beyond thirty that compete at each regional meet. At state, a preliminary and finals round also exists.\n\n\n=== Regional and state host sites ===\nFor all events in all conferences, the University of Texas at Austin currently serves as the host site for the state meet, although the Texas State Capitol hosts the State Finals in Congressional Debate.\nThe following regions are hosted at the following locations:\n\n1A Region I - South Plains College in Levelland\n1A Region II - Angelo State University in San Angelo\n1A Region III - McMillen High School in Murphy (Plano ISD)\n1A Region IV - Blinn College in Brenham\n2A Region I - West Texas A&M in Canyon\n2A Region II - Grayson College in Denison\n2A Region III - Panola College in Carthage\n2A Region IV - Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi\n3A Region I - Abilene Christian University in Abilene\n3A Region II - Tyler Junior College in Tyler\n3A Region III - Blinn College in Brenham\n3A Region IV - Davenport High School in San Antonio\n4A Region I - Texas Tech University in Lubbock\n4A Region II - Texas A&M-Commerce in Commerce\n4A Region III - Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches\n4A Region IV - Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi\n5A Region I - Texas Tech University in Lubbock\n5A Region II - University of Texas-Arlington in Arlington\n5A Region III - Fulshear High School in Fulshear\n5A Region IV - University of Texas-San Antonio in San Antonio\n6A Region I - Rock Hill High School in Prosper\n6A Region II - Baylor University in Waco\n6A Region III - Seven Lakes High School in Katy\n6A Region IV - University of Texas-San Antonio in San Antonio\n\n\n== A+ Academics ==\nUIL A+ Academics are similar to other UIL Academics contests, except they are intended for Elementary and Middle School. Other notable differences exist as well. For example, A+ Academics events have no post-district advancement. Additionally, unlike the high school contests, where the UIL designs districts and regions for competitions, Elementary and Middle schools are free to determine their own districts. For smaller school districts, it is commonplace for multiple ISDs to come together into one A+ Academics District. School districts with multiple elementary or middle schools also organize themselves into districts whenever possible.\n\n\n=== List of events ===\nArt (two divisions for grades 4–6 and 7–8)\nCalculator Applications (one division for grades 6–8)\nChess Problem Solving (grades 2–8)\nCreative Writing (one division for grade 2 only)\nDictionary Skills (two divisions for grades 5–6 and 7–8)\nEditorial Writing (one division for grades 7–8)\nImpromptu Speaking (one division for grades 6–8)\nListening (two divisions for grades 5–6 and 7–8)\nMaps, Graphs & Charts (two divisions for grades 5–6 and 7–8)\nMathematics (one division for grades 6–8)\nModern Oratory (one division for grades 6–8)\nMusic Memory (two divisions for grades 3–4 and 5–6)\nNumber Sense (two divisions for grades 4–6 and 7–8)\nOne-Act Play (one division for grades 6–8)\nOral Reading (two divisions for grades 4–6 and 7–9)\nReady Writing (three divisions for grades 3–4, 5–6, and 7–8)\nScience I and II (grades 7 and 8, respectively)\nSocial Studies (two divisions for grades 5–6 and 7–8)\nSpelling (three divisions for grades 3–4, 5–6, and 7–8)\nStorytelling (one division for grades 2–3)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections across the United Kingdom being held on the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Calderdale was a district of the West Yorkshire metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The West Yorkshire Combined Authority was established in 2014 and began electing the mayor of West Yorkshire in 2021.\nCalderdale Council was under no overall control with Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour leaders until the Labour Party achieved a majority of seats in the 2019 election, when they gained four seats to hold 28 of the council's 51 seats. In the most recent election in 2023, seventeen seats were up for election. Labour won ten seats, the Conservatives won four seats, Liberal Democrats won two seats and the Greens won one seat.\nSeats up for election in 2024 were last elected in 2021. These elections were originally scheduled for 2020, but were delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that election, the Conservatives won nine seats, Labour won eight, and the Liberal Democrats won two. Labour retained its majority on the council at this election.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election for three consecutive years and no election in the fourth year. The election used first-past-the-post voting, with wards generally being represented by three councillors, with one elected in each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Calderdale aged 18 or over were entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations took place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters were able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nNovember 2023: Guy Beech (Conservative) resigns; seat will remain vacant until the regularly schedule May 2024 elections.\nFebruary 2024: Rahat Khan resigns from the Labour Party and sits as an independent.\n\n\n== Results ==\nIncumbent councillors are marked with an asterisk.\n\n\n=== Brighouse ===\n\n\n=== Calder ===\n\n\n=== Elland ===\n\n\n=== Greetland and Stainland ===\n\n\n=== Hipperholme and Lightcliffe ===\n\n\n=== Ilingworth and Mixenden ===\n\n\n=== Luddendenfoot ===\n\n\n=== Northowram and Shelf ===\n\n\n=== Ovenden ===\n\n\n=== Park ===\n\n\n=== Rastrick ===\n\n\n=== Ryburn ===\n\n\n=== Skircoat ===\n\n\n=== Sowerby Bridge ===\n\n\n=== Todmorden ===\n\n\n=== Town ===\n\n\n=== Warley ===\n\n\n== References ==",

King was an Roman Catholic. She sung in the choir and attended Weber High School. She was importantly influenced by glee clubs, talent shows, and formal opera studies. In 1956, she majored in music at University of Southern California, after receiving a scholarship. In May 1963, King performed in Ray Charles' backing group the Raelettes during his shows in Paris, and had her own solo act in the shows during that same period, accomped by Charles' orchestra. In July that same year, she backed Del Shannon on his song \"Red Rubber Ball\" in the vocal chorus. The following year, she joined the Blossoms through a connection with H. B. Barnum, replacing Gracia Nitzsche. She replaced Nitzsche, who was white, after the group received a call by Shindig! to appear on the show after Nitzsche left because Shindig did not want a mixed group on the show. However, they continued to perform on the show from 1964 until 1966. During her tenure in the group, she had a stint as a solo artist, recording for Hanna-Barbera subsidiary Hanna-Barbera Records, and King released her debut and only studio album, \"Sings for the In-Crowd\" in May 1966. Throughout her tenure with the Blossoms, she sung backup for Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Nancy Sinatra, and Bill Medley. By 1974, after Love left following a backstage incident that caused the Blossoms to be fired as background singers by Dionne Warwick, and King's collapse after taking drugs, King and James continued the Blossoms, performing in Las Vegas as background singers with Alex Brown, Stephanie Spruill, and Cynthia Woodward as replacements for Love. They released a single, \"A.P.B.\" in 1977, on MAM Records. In her later years, she remained in Las Vegas, and married soundman Larry Richstein (1945–2012). On March 28, 1983, King suffered a massive heart attack and died in Las Vegas at the age of 44. She was survived by her children, Debbie, Lisa, and Jai, and her husband.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nSings for the In-Crowd (1966, Hanna-Barbera Records)\nSingles\nSomething Happens to Me (1965, Hanna-Barbera Records)\nDon't Say Goodbye (1966, Hanna-Barbera Records)\nWatermelon Man (1966, Hanna-Barbera Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJean King Credits on AllMusic\nJean King discography at Discogs",

She is a Scientific Director of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter, FL, and was formerly a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the University of California, Davis. Tian is known for her research in the fields of neuroscience and biochemical engineering. She develops and applies molecular tools to understand brain function and dysfunction at the individual, neuronal level.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTian received her Ph.D. in biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology at Northwestern University, where she studied the mechanism of protein processing by the proteasome. Her graduate advisor was Andreas Matouschek.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Tian was a postdoctoral scholar at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's (HHMI) Janelia Research Campus, working with Loren Looger and Karel Svoboda. During this time, Tian began her work on the development of tools for enhanced neuronal imaging and cell-specific labeling. She created protein-based tools, including improved GCaMP indicators, for studying and manipulating the brain and other biological samples.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nTian started her lab at UC Davis in 2012 as an assistant professor, later becoming a Professor and Vice Chair. In October 2023, she became a Scientific Director at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience.\nTian is best known for creating a new classes of genetically encoded indicators for detecting neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, such as serotonin and dopamine. She and her team use molecular scaffolds and computational modeling to create the biosensors, which can dynamically map neurotransmitter flow in the brain. These tools are distributed through UNC NeuroTools and Addgene.  Her work has implications for drug discovery, aiding in the identification of new therapeutic targets.\nShe also worked with David E. Olson and developed a method to identify the hallucinogenic potential of psychedelic compounds.  They engineered psychLight5, a “sensor that glows in the presence of a hallucinogenic compound when it interacts with a serotonin receptor.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nW.M. Keck Foundation Research Award (2022); joint with Na Ji\nRita Allen Young Investigator Award (2016)\nNIH Director's Innovator Award (2014)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLin Tian publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "Grand Slang is a calligraphic sans serif typeface created by a German graphic designer named Nikolas Wrobel. It was released on September 1, 2019, through his type foundry, Nikolas Type.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe idea for the design of Grand Slang (IPA /ɡɹˈænd slˈæŋ/) draws inspiration from 20th century American calligraphy and the works of American calligraphers Oscar Ogg and William Addison Dwiggins. Additionally, it takes cues from signs in American movies from the 1940s and 1950s.Grand Slang combines strength and versatility by blending elements of traditional and contemporary handwriting, alongside basic shapes. It encompasses more than 310 glyphs, covering capital and small letters, numbers, punctuation marks, ligatures, diacritics and symbols.\nThe name Grand Slang is derived from the English words grand and slang. The word grand is used in US and UK slang to signify a thousand dollars or a thousand pounds.The typeface is available for download online in OTF and WOFF file formats, making it suitable for graphic design, web design, applications and e-books.Grand Slang supports writing in numerous European languages that use the Latin alphabet. It is a proprietary software (or closed source software), meaning it can be used only by accepting the terms of the software license.\n\n\n== Related pages ==\nTypography\nFont\n\n\n== Other websites ==\nOfficial website\nFonts In Use (Grand Slang)\n Media related to Grand Slang at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gonzalez v. Trevino (Docket No. 22-1025) is a pending United States Supreme Court case relating to Nieves v. Bartlett. In the case, the Court will clarify the scope of Nieves, and the requirements for a plaintiff to allege a retaliatory arrest claim.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Nieves v. Bartlett ===\nNieves v. Bartlett is a 2019 United States Supreme Court case. The case involved the issue of whether probable cause to arrest a suspect defeats a retaliatory arrest claim. In that case, Russell Bartlett sued Luis Nieves and his colleague, both Alaska State Troopers. Bartlett alleged that he had been retaliated against for his protected First Amendment speech by being arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The arrest in question was based on probable cause. The court held that probable cause will \"generally\" defeat a claim of retaliatory arrest, except in cases where an officer would typically exercise discretion not to make an arrest, such as in cases of jaywalking. The Court explained:\n\n[W]e conclude that the no-probable cause requirement should not apply when a plaintiff presents objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\n\n\n=== Factual Background ===\nIn May, 2019, Sylvia Gonzalez—who had then recently been elected to the city council of Castle Hills, Texas—spoke at a city council meeting in favor of removing the city manager, a motion she led. Gonzalez had long been a critic of the local government. Near the end of the meeting and while gathering her papers, Gonzalez mistakenly gathered up the petition along with her belongings. Noticing this mistake, Gonzalez removed the petition from her belongings soon after.\nMonths later, Gonzalez was arrested and charged with “destroy[ing], conceal[ing], remov[ing], or otherwise impair[ing] the verity, legibility, or availability of a governmental record.”  Gonzalez was booked into the county jail, wore inmate attire, and was required to wear handcuffs.\nGonzales sued various local officials—including mayor Edward Trevino, II, the chief of police, and a lawyer-turned special detective for the police—for retaliatory arrest against her protected First Amendment speech, the culmination of an alleged months-long scheme to punish her for her petition to remove the city manager. In her complaint, Gonzalez accused the city officials of deliberately circumventing the district attorney's office in order to insure that Gonzalez would be arrested and formally booked into jail, rather than simply issued a summons—upon learning of the charges, the district attorney's office immediately dismissed them. The complaint also documented the absence of arrests for conduct similar to Gonzalez's in the decade prior to her arrest. The complaint sought retrospective relief; at that time, Gonzalez's mugshot had already been widely disseminated, and she had been hounded out of office.\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds of qualified immunity. This motion was denied by the district court. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Nieves probable cause exception could not be invoked unless Gonzalez could point to specific individuals who were not critics of the Castle Hills local government, and had not been arrested after mishandling a government petition.\n\n\n== Supreme Court ==\nOn April 20, 2023, Gonzalez petitioned the Supreme Court to hear her case. On October 13, the Court granted certiorari. Oral arguments were heard on March 20, 2024. The case was argued by Anya Bidwell, Nicole F. Reaves, and Lisa Blatt, on behalf of Gonzalez, the United States, and Trevino, respectively.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sivabhuti was a Jain monk in the 1st century AD who is regarded as the monk who started the Digambara tradition in 82 AD as per the 5th century Śvetāmbara text Avashyak Bhashya written by Jinabhadra. Little is known about him apart from a single story that is written in the ancient Śvetāmbara text. Among several works of research on Jainism, The Jains, a book by Paul Dundas mentions him and the story. However, historical authenticity of his existence or the truthfulness of the story has not been verified.\n\n\n== Background ==\nŚvetāmbara texts accuse of starting the Digambara tradition with \"eight concealments\" of rejection of Jain texts followed and preserved by Śvetāmbaras. Śvetāmbara texts openly and directly accuse him of gravely misunderstanding scriptures and traditional Jain ideologies regarding draping of clothes and stree nirvana (attainment of liberation or nirvana by women).\n\n\n== Story of Creation of Digambara Sect ==\nAccording to the Śvetāmbaras, the Digambara sect was formed by a rebellious monk named Sivabhuti in 82 AD. The basis for this is the scripture Avashyak Bhashya composed by Acharya Jinbhadragani Kshamashraman.\nThe story says that about 609 years after Mahavira attained nirvana, there was a city Rathavirapur near present-day Mathura. A layperson named Sivabhuti lived there and worked for King Sinharath. He had earned several accolades for his service to the king. As a result, he turned 'proud' and often stayed out of home late at nights. Once, his wife complained to his mother. To teach him a lesson, his mother asked him to leave and go somewhere else. Wandering, he entered Arya Krishnasuri's upashray (dwelling). After taking alochna (repentance) from Acharya Krishnasuri, he requested to become a monk. Sivabhuti was then initiated as a monk.\nOne day, while wandering as a monk, he arrived at Rathavirapur. On hearing about his arrival, the king gifted him a shawl (ratna-kambal). The shawl was a precious possession, but such a thing was totally against the Jain principle (vow) of Aparigraha. His preceptor, Acharya Krishnasuri tried to explain this to him, but to no avail. The acharya tore the shawl and this did not go well with Sivabhuti. He protested by stating that if the shawl was a possession then so were clothes. He adopted nudity immediately. Two monks Kaundinya and Kottavira joined him as disciples and this was the beginning of the Digambar sect. He preached that Moksha can be attained only through complete non-possession, including clothes. Śvetāmbaras believe he had heard his preceptor talk about jinkalpa (a way of attaining liberation by giving up all possessions, including clothes). However, he heard him mention that the culture had become extinct after Ganadhar Jambuswami. He, then, based on his limited knowledge of scriptures, rebelliously started imitating tirthankars and preaching that public nudity even with incomplete and insufficient knowledge of the scriptures was permitted in Jainism. This was in contradiction to the major Śvetāmbara texts like Acharanga Sutra and Uttaradhyayana Sutra.\nThe scripture also states that Sivabhuti's sister adopted nudity and joined him. However, the society thought of her as a prostitute, so Sivabhuti prevented nuns from staying nude. A condition was enforced that since women possess clothes in Digambara tradition, they are not fit to attain Moksha or liberation. This is in accordance with what current-day Digambaras believe regarding women attaining salvation.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDundas, Paul (2002) [1992]. The Jains (Second ed.).

        "content": "John Farinacci (born February 14, 2001) is an American ice hockey forward currently playing for the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect to the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 76th overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the third round of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He played college ice hockey for the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nRaised in Red Bank, New Jersey, Farinacci played prep hockey for the Delbarton School before transferring to Shattuck-Saint Mary's.\n\n\n=== Collegiate ===\nFarinacci was drafted 76th overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He committed to play college ice hockey at Harvard University starting in the 2019–20 season.\nFarinacci had a successful freshman year with the Crimson, scoring 10 goals and 12 assists for 22 points in 31 games. Unfortunately, Farinacci and the rest of the team's season was abruptly cancelled during the 2020 ECAC Hockey Tournament due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nAfter initially expecting to play, the Ivy League announced on November 12, 2020, that they would be cancelling winter sports for the season. This meant that Farinacci would not play for Harvard in the 2020–21 season. However, this did not stop him from playing successful hockey. For the season, he returned to play for the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the United States Hockey League (USHL), where he played for a little while before committing to Harvard. In seven games with the Lumberjacks, serving as an assistant captain, he scored four goals and four assists. Farinacci also played on the international stage during the season, representing the United States at the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he scored five goals and two assists in seven games en route to the gold medal. After the tournament, he would not return to play for the Lumberjacks, instead opting to train and focus on preparing for his next season at Harvard.\nFarinacci returned to Harvard for the 2021–22 season for his junior year. Unfortunately for Farinacci, his production dipped in comparison to his freshman year, scoring 10 goals and nine assists for 19 points in 29 games. However, he helped Harvard win the 2022 ECAC Hockey tournament, giving Harvard an automatic bid in the 2022 NCAA tournament. Harvard would be eliminated in the first round to the Minnesota State Mavericks.\nFarinacci was named captain of the Crimson for the 2022–23 season. However, he would end up missing the first part of the season recovering from surgery due to a herniated disc. After returning to action on January 13, 2023, Farinacci put up great numbers and had his best statistical season at Harvard yet, given his missed time. He scored five goals and 15 assists in 19 games. Farinacci would help Harvard reach the final of the 2023 ECAC Hockey tournament, where they would lose to the Colgate Raiders. Despite this, Harvard still received a bid to the 2023 NCAA tournament, where they would lose 8–1 in the first round to the Ohio State Buckeyes, in what would be Farinacci's final game of his college career. Farinacci scored the lone Crimson goal in the loss.\nThe Ivy League did not offer their athletes another year of eligibility due to the lost 2020–21 season. As such, Farinacci could not return to Harvard for a fourth season. Although he could've transferred for another year, Farinacci did not want to play college hockey anywhere but Harvard, and as such, was set to turn pro.\n\n\n=== Professional ===\nOn April 12, 2023, it was announced that Farinacci would not sign with the Coyotes, and intended to test the free agent market. He became a highly coveted collegiate free agent, and ultimately signed a two-year entry level contract with the Bruins on August 16, 2023.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nFarinacci has many connections within the hockey community. He is cousins with Chicago Blackhawks forward Ryan Donato, and his uncle, Ted Donato was his head coach at Harvard.\nFarinacci is also Brady Tkachuk's brother-in-law.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com",

        "content": "Pouria Zeraati (Persian: پوریا زراعتی; born 22 September 1987) is an Iranian-British journalist and reporter for Iran International. In March 2024, Zeraati was hospitalized due to being stabbed by unidentified assailants upon leaving his London residence.\n\n\n== Career ==\nZeraati was born in Babolsar, Mazandaran. He received a degree in mechanical engineering from Brunel University London, and was a newsroom editor, host, and announcer on Manoto Network, and joined Iran International Network in 2020 as a producer and presenter of the program \"The Last Word\".\n\n\n== Attack ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nIn December 2021, British ITV news channel reported in an exclusive report that \"Iranian spies\" had ordered a \"human trafficker\" in exchange for the payment of 200 thousand dollars, to terrorize IITV presenters Sima Thabit and Fardad Farahzad.\nIn February 2023, amidst the Mahsa Amini protests, Iran International reported about the threats from the Revolutionary Guards against its journalists.\n\n\n=== Stabbing ===\nOn 30 March 2024, upon leaving his London residence, Pouria Zeraati was attacked by some unidentified assailants, stabbing him in the leg. Iran International announced that he is hospitalized and his condition is stable.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nThe attack was widely condemned by Iranian and international celebrities, journalists and media, political activists, human rights defenders and social media users, and was reflected in British and world media. After the news of the attack on Zeraati, a number of Iran International audiences condemned the attack and wished him well. Protesters of the attack wrote slogans on the wall next to a street in Tehran against the Islamic Republic and in support of Pouria Zeraati and Sara Tabrizi. Notable figures stated:\n\nAlicia Kearns, Chair of the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said: \"It is with great sadness that Iran International has had to close its UK office for a short period of time and has recently started broadcasting live from London. While we do not know the circumstances of this attack, Iran continues to pursue those who have the courage to speak against it. However, I am not convinced that we and our allies have clear strategies to protect people in our countries from them (the Iranian regime) and to protect our interests abroad.\"\nThe National Union of Journalists of Great Britain and Ireland called it \"shocking\" in a statement. Michelle Stanistreet, General Secretary of the NUJ, said: \"The systematic targeting of journalists simply for doing their jobs must stop. \"The international community should increase the pressure on Iran and the United Nations should hold Iran accountable for its actions.\"\nHamed Esmaeilion called this act brutal and wrote: \"The horrific news of an Iranian journalist stabbed in London this morning is outrageous. I wish a speedy recovery for Mr. Pouria Zeraati and his return to work. Hopefully the London Police will find the perpetrators of this crime and those behind it. A free press is one of the pillars of democracy, it is sad to see these heinous acts happen in the free world.\"\nMasih Alinejad wrote: \"I am deeply disturbed by the cowardly assault on my friend Pouria Zeerati, an Iranian journalist in London. Pouria was stabbed near his residence in London; as the host of Iran International’s Last Word show, he sustained multiple knife wounds and has been hospitalized. He is a brave journalist who has dedicated his life to expose Islamic Republic’s crimes and acts of terrorism. My thoughts are with him and his family during this difficult time for the international governments to take Islamic Republic threats, seriously and criminalize transnational repression. I strongly urge the London police to conduct a thorough investigation into this appalling attack. It is alarming to note that journalists from [Iran] International TV have been subjected to ongoing threats from the Islamic Republic. We must unite in condemning such senseless acts of aggression.\"\nNazanin Boniadi, human rights activist: \"Horrified to learn that my friend, prominent Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati was stabbed outside his home in London. While we wait for an investigation, I hope the Met Police takes the threats by the Islamic Republic to kill Iranian journalists in exile seriously.\"\nAlireza Akhondi, an Iranian representative of the Swedish Parliament: \"One of the most prominent Iranian journalists, Pouria Zeraati has been viciously attacked with a knife in London. Let me be unequivocal: this heinous act reeks of #IRGCterrorists and the unmistakable hand of the Islamic regime. I demand swift and transparent action from the British government to apprehend the culprits and safeguard other fearless Iranian opposition voices.\"\nNazanin Afshin-Jam, human rights activist: \"How many more assassination plots before the UK, Canada, Australia and countries in the EU will list the IRGC on the terrorist list? #IRGCterrorists\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bleached Wavves is the debut studio album by Ojibwe shoegaze musician Daniel Monkman, known by the stage name Zoon. The album was released on June 19, 2020, via Paper Bag Records. Monkman was raised in the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation and faced many struggles growing up, such as poverty and addiction. They discovered shoegaze music as a teenager, and started a band after moving to Hamilton, Ontario. The album has been described as shoegaze and \"moccasin-gaze\". It has received positive reviews from AllMusic, Exclaim!, and No Ripcord. It was also shortlisted for the 2021 Polaris Music Prize. \n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nDaniel Monkman is an indigenous Canadian who was raised in the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, near Winnipeg, Manitoba. Monkman discovered shoegaze music as a teenager. They faced many struggles while growing up, including poverty and addiction, leading them to seek spirituality. They moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where they started the band Bloom, later renamed to Zoon after the Ojibwe word Zoongide'ewin. Under Bloom, Monkman released the EP Bleached Wavves via cassette-only, containing early versions of some songs that were on the album.\nMonkman had their equipment stolen prior to finishing the album. They recorded Bleached Wavves mostly alone, using a guitar and one effects pedal. The album was released on June 19, 2020, via Paper Bag Records.\n\n\n== Music ==\nBleached Wavves is a shoegaze album that has drawn comparisons to My Bloody Valentine. The album has also been described as \"moccasin-gaze\", which is a blend of shoegaze with North American Indigenous music.\n\"Vibrant Colours\" takes inspiration from Madchester. \"Was & Always Will Be\" expands on shoegaze's sound and was described as \"less a song than a mantra\" by Paul Simpson of AllMusic. Guitars reminiscent of Slowdive feature on \"Light Prism\". \"Infinite Horizons\" features a spoken word monologue about Monkman's ancestry and history. The instrumental \"Landscapes\" uses guitars and \"hard rhythmic panning\".

        "content": "The 1863 Georgia gubernatorial election was held on October 5, 1863, in order to elect the Governor of Georgia. It was the last gubernatorial election in Georgia under the Confederate States of America and saw Independent Democrat nominee and incumbent Governor Joseph E. Brown win a fourth and final term against Unionist nominee Joshua Hill and Pro-Administration nominee Lt. Col Timothy Furlow.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Search for a successor ===\nInitially, Brown never intended to run for a fourth term and had early in 1863 begun to look around for a State Rights Democrat to succeed him. One while doing his duty towards the Confederacy, would protect the rights and sovereignty of Georgia.\nHe thought it was best to leave his opponents under the delusion that he would run for another term and so never made any public announcement of his plans to step down. In the meantime, he chose Linton Stephens, junior half-brother of Alexander H. Stephens, from a list of possible people to succeed him. Robert Toombs, Confederate Brigadier General,  was his second choice and Brown was willing to step aside to support either of them.\nStephens refused to run for governor and so Brown turned to Toombs, who having resigned his brigade command in March 1863, returned to Georgia, and it was generally believed that he had political ambitions. Duff Green prophesied that Toombs would be elected governor of Georgia in the autumn of 1863 and that the state would possibly make peace with the Union. A. H. Kenan feared that Toombs would seek the office and he raised the question of Toombs' avowed opposition to President Davis in an effort to weaken Toombs's candidacy. The editor of the Enquirer did not want Toombs to seek the governorship as it would create a situation in Georgia analogous to that in North Carolina where an avowed anti-Davis man was standing for governor. Mention was made of Toombs's address on \"The State of the Republic\" at Sparta on June 17, 1863, an address in which Toombs roundly scored President Davis and the policies of the administration at Richmond.\nIt's highly possible that Toombs gave the governorship a consideration but he chose to run for Senate instead, being decisively defeated for the Confederate senate by former governor H. V. Johnson.\n\n\n=== Brown candidacy ===\nBrown feared that the \"administration\" at Richmond would support a Pro-Administarion candidate with Confederate Congressman and former Confederate General Lucius J. Gartrell being seen as the most formidable possible candidate. It was his popularity among the troops that scared Brown the most.\nBrown's concerns were not unfounded as there was a distinct demand in Georgia for a \"Jeff Davis man\" for governor. An editorial in the Daily Sun advocated for Brown's removal from office, arguing that a \"good and loyal\" individual should take his place. The organ disputed the notion that conscription was widely unpopular in Georgia or that Brown enjoyed significant support among the military, except for a small faction within the state militia seeking his favor. It predicted Brown's defeat by a margin of 20,000 votes.\nUpon failing to identify another State Rights advocate to assume his position, Brown opted to seek reelection. Prior to launching his campaign, Brown took measures to disassociate himself from being perceived as an opponent of the current administration. He advocated for maintaining the existing administration and supported increasing Confederate private salaries from $11 to $20. He asserted that he had effectively neutralized any Pro-Administration candidate who might challenge him on grounds of loyalty to the Confederacy. In a letter of consent dated May 21, he acknowledged his previous pursuit of the governorship during peacetime but affirmed his willingness to continue serving if reelected during wartime. He suggested that changing leadership amidst the turmoil of war would be unwise and that he possessed superior qualifications compared to any potential newcomer. Regarding his stance against conscription, he maintained that his opposition stemmed from honest conviction.\n\n\n=== Opposition candidates ===\nNone of the Pro-Administration candidates whom Brown anticipated stood for the office, but he was not without opposition. The Atlanta Gazette hoisted the banner of Joshua Y. Hill of Madison and the Southern Recorder placed Lt. Col Timothy M. Furlow of Americus in the race. Neither of these men made a formidable opponent for Brown.\nAlthough a plantation owner, Hill bitterly opposed secession in 1861, always denying the legality of the ordinance of secession. Throughout the war, he was regarded as a reconstructionist and a Union man. Hill was in touch with William Tecumseh Sherman during the general's March to the Sea in September 1864 and during the Reconstruction period he went over to the Republican Party. He was the candidate of the old Whig-American group and the Peace Party in Georgia, becoming a rallying point for the growing faction in Northern Georgia.\nFurlow emerged as the candidate appealing to those who disagreed with Hill's unionist principles and Brown's hostility to Confederate policies under Davis. In a letter consenting to his nomination, Furlow emphasized the necessity of Confederate independence, asserting that all physically capable men must serve in the army. Distinguishing himself from Brown, he stated, \"If elected Governor, I shall throw no official protection around any citizen within the embrace of the Conscript Law.\" Brown had previously halted the draft in certain north Georgia counties in defiance of the state supreme court's support for conscription. His attempts to coerce the legislature into aligning with his anti-Richmond stance left him potentially susceptible on this issue.\n\n\n=== Plan ===\nDuring this time there was no run-off system like there is today. If no candidate could receive a majority vote then the election would be thrown into the Georgia General Assembly. It just so happened that the General Assembly was majority Anti-Brown and so it was hoped that Furlow would get enough loyal and state-rights Democratic votes to prevent Brown from receiving a majority over him and Hill.\nThe newspapers opposing Brown displayed even greater animosity than in the previous election, launching attacks on every vulnerable aspect of his character. Accusations against Brown ranged from demagoguery and self-serving behavior to religious hypocrisy, dishonesty, and disloyalty to the Confederacy. Critics highlighted Brown's tactic of portraying himself as \"conscripted\" into seeking reelection, reminiscent of his actions in 1861, and argued that his announcement of not actively pursuing the office was merely a ploy to elicit public support for a \"call to service.\" He was labelled as an  \"oily flatterer of the masses\" and of ever trying to ingratiate himself with the masses. Brown's supporters harped on the idea that the office should be conferred upon the man and should not be sought. It was pointed out by Brown's enemies that such an argument gave Brown an unfair advantage because he was already in office.\nJust like the last election, his opponents were enraged at the idea of office not being changed in times of war and often referred to him as \"Joseph I.\"\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, October 5, 1863, Independent Democrat nominee Joseph E. Brown won re-election by a margin of 8,262 votes against Unionist nominee Joshua Hill and Pro-Administration nominee Lt. Col Timothy Furlow, thereby becoming the first person to hold the office of Governor of Georgia for four terms. Brown was sworn in for his fourth and final term on January 3, 1864.\nWhile Hill polled his greatest vote from the old Union element in the mountainous counties of the North and was supported by hard-line anti-confederate Unionists, it was in no means a reconstruction vote. According to James Bass, he polled the tired-of-the-war vote plus a certain conservative vote. Benjamin Harvey Hill, though of no family relation, supported him as did many old Whigs and Americans.\nIt was obvious that Furlow failed to carry the full strength of the so-called loyal vote, failing to win a single county north of the capital. \nFor what Brown lost to Hill in north Georgia, he had made more than a corresponding gain in central and south Georgia.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works Cited ==\nBass, James (1933). \"THE GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS OF 1861 AND 1863\".

        "content": "The Battle of Butera happened in late 845 or early 846 between the Aghlabid army and the Byzantine army at Butera, south of Sicily. The Aghlabids achieved a resounding success against the Byzantines.\nIn 845, the Byzantines and the Abbasids made a peace treaty. The Byzantine empress, Theodora, wanting to take advantage of the peace treaty, dispatched an army to re-establish Byzantine control of Sicily. The Byzantine army was mostly recruited from the theme of Charsianon. The Byzantine numbers were substantial and were equipped and ready to fight. The Byzantine general, however, was not ready. Both sides met at Butera, and the Aghlabid general, Al-Abbas ibn al-Fadl, defeated the Byzantines and killed 9,000 to 10,000 of their troops, according to Arab sources, which is probably an exaggeration. The Aghlabid casualties were insignificant. The battle happened either in late 845 or early 846.\nFollowing this defeat, the Byzantines suffered several setbacks in quick succession. In 846, the Arabs annexed Lentini and destroyed Ragusa in 848. For his victory at Butera, Al-Abbas became the governor of Sicily in 851.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAndrew Holt & Florin Curta (2016), Great Events in Religion, An Encyclopedia of Pivotal Events in Religious History.[2]\nJohn Bagnell Bury, A history of the Eastern Roman empire [3]\nAlexander A.

        "content": "'Amir al-Liwa' Ismail Pasha Abu Jabal (Egyptian Arabic: إسماعيل باشا أبو جبل) (1234 AH – 17 Jumada al-Thani 1300 AH) was an Egyptian military and political leader who lived in the nineteenth century. He participated as a brigade commander in the Crimean War, which the Egyptian army fought alongside the armies of the Ottoman Empire, and then the wāli of Egypt, Sa'id Pasha, assigned him - on Muharram 15, 1272 AH, corresponding to September 27, 1855 AD - to lead the Egyptian armies in the Crimea after Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali was excused due to ill health.\n\n\n== Upbringing ==\nIsmail Haqqi bin Suleiman bin Bakir bin Ahmad was born in the year 1234 AH in the village of Muridi, in the state of Ma'amoura al-Aziz (Elazığ) in Anatolia, and his father was the Kaymakam of his village. His father sent him to Egypt in the year 1248 AH, where he joined the Darsakhana School in the Citadel, where he mastered the Turkish and Persian languages speaking and writing. Then he moved to the military schools in Bujaq al-Nakhila (in Khanka).\n\n\n== Miltiary career ==\nOn 4 Safar 1250 AH, he was attached to the 21st Infantry Alai (regiment) (21st Ji Alai Bayada) with the position of Barinji Alamdar, then he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in Barinji Orta (battalion) 8 J Block, and was soon promoted to the rank of Yuzbashi Baranji Orta Barinji Block on 6 Dhu al-Qadah. Then he traveled within the forces of Ibrahim Pasha to fight the Wahhabis, and there he was promoted to the rank of Barinji Saghul Aghasi, then he was promoted to the rank of 2nd G Bekbashi after he proved his worth in the battle of Jabal al-Diriyah, then he was promoted to the rank of Barinji Bekbashi (which is equivalent to the rank of Kaymakam) and was appointed commander of a group of soldiers that fought a decisive battle in which Ismail Pasha performed well.\nAfter Ismail Pasha returned from Hejaz with the Egyptian expedition, he was granted the rank of Amiralai, and on the seventh of Jumada al-Thani in the year 1266 AH, he was promoted to the rank of Major General, and was entrusted with the command of Alai 3G and Alai 4G Bayada (infantry), then he was appointed Director of the General Directorates of Qena and Esna, then Hakmdar (governor) of Sudan and a commander of its soldiers, then he returned to Egypt and was appointed general of Beringi Alai and 4G Alai Bayada.\nWhen the Crimean War broke out, the Ottoman Empire requested an Egyptian expedition to fight the Russians, so the Egyptian government prepared an army whose commander-in-chief was Ahmad Pasha al-Munkali, and Ismail Pasha Abu Jabal was appointed as a second commandant of three columns of Bayada soldiers, alai of Zarkh cavalry, and a section of Tobgia (artillery) instead of Major General Ahmad Pasha Shukri.\nThen al-Munkali Pasha was relieved of command of the expedition due to his ill health, so Sa'id Pasha relieved him on September 27, 1855, AD (Muharram 15, 1272 AH), and Ismail Pasha Abu Jabal took his place.\nFollowing Abu Jabal's return to Egypt in the year 1272 AH, he was appointed temporary president of the Tanta Council, then he was appointed general commander (commander-in-chief) of the infantry soldiers, during the reign of Sa'id Pasha, and he remained in this position until the Nizarat al-Jihadia (Ministry of War) order was issued to dispense with all brigades and assistants, so he resigned and was given Atyan. As a pensioner, however, he was soon returned to military service and appointed a major general in charge of the al-Ma'ia al-Sunnia soldiers, then he was appointed a member of the ruling council, then he was appointed “Sir Çeşmeh Ordi” in the Jihadia office instead of Ali Pasha Qulli, then he returned again to the ruling council, which he soon returned to. It was canceled by order of Sa'id Pasha, so Ismail Pasha was appointed commissioner to sell the Miri properties (government properties) to pay off the debts.\nMeanwhile, the Arabs of Faiyum and al-Wahat rebelled, so Ismail Pasha was appointed as an extraordinary military commander to put down their revolt. He succeeded in doing so, then he was appointed director of the Qena and Esna districts. At that time, the Crown Prince of Belgium (King Leopold II later) came to visit Upper Egypt, and Ismail Pasha met him. He stayed with him for the duration of his stay, and when the Belgian prince returned to his country, the government of Belgium presented Abu Jabal with the Order of Leopold, with the rank of Officer, accompanied by a letter of thanks received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated July 12, 1863 AD.\nThen Abu Jabal was appointed head of the Military Council in Egypt, then director of Gharbia, then Khedive Ismail granted him the rank of lieutenant general, then he was appointed a member of the Council of Rules until that council was abolished.\nIn the year 1283 AH, Abu Jabal assumed the position of Ma'moor 'Omoom al-Malahat, then the mission of the improvements of the Ibrahimiya Canal in Dairut was added to his responsibilities. He was then appointed governor of Cairo while the first mission remained in his charge. Then he was separated from it and appointed as a warden for collections of late funds in Upper Egypt. In the year 1291 AH, he was appointed a member of the Judgments Council, and in the following year he was appointed deputy of that council. Then in the following year he assumed the position of Secretary-General of the Egyptian Treasury, and on April 10, 1879, he was appointed President of the Judgments Council, and he remained in this position until he was retired on September 15. 1879.\nWhen the Urabi Revolt broke out, Abu Jabal was one of its major opponents, and he accompanied Khedive Tawfiq to Alexandria, and after the attack on Alexandria, he accompanied Tawfiq to the Ras el-Tin Palace, but his health soon deteriorated after his return to Cairo, where he died on Jumada al-Thani 17, 1300 AH.\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nAbu Jabal was given this title in honor of his good performance in one of the battles of the Wahhabi wars. In one incident, the force he was leading was trapped in the mountain, and the enemy surrounded them from every direction. Ismail Pasha drew his sword and led his soldiers in a counterattack. Ibrahim Pasha was watching the fighting from a distance. Ismail Pasha was seriously injured in this battle, but it has been proven that with his soldiers until he was finally victorious, Ibrahim Pasha summoned him and thanked him for his valor and ordered his personal doctor to treat his wounds, and from that time he was nicknamed Abu Jabal.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nOrder of the Medjidie, second class (Ottoman Empire)\nMedal of Excellence (Ottoman Empire)\nTurkish Crimea Medal (Ottoman Empire)\nOrder of Glory (Ottoman Empire)\nOrder of Leopold (Belgium)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Rev. Philip Fernandez was a footballer who played in the 1877 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFernandez was the eldest son of Thomas Francis of Madras, where he was born in 1854; by 1861 the family was back in England.  He was educated at Westminster School, which was an early adopter of association laws.  He represented the school at the Winchester code of football against London Wykehmanists,  and College against the Commoners in the \"fifteens\", in 1871. He also represented the college at cricket.\nIn 1873, he went up to Trinity College, Oxford; he took his Bachelor of Arts in 1877 and his Master of Arts in 1880.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nFernandez first appeared for the Oxford University A.F.C. in February 1874, in a 2–1 win over a Gitanos side featuring many Wanderers players.  He was not a regular University player, making his first competitive appearance in a 2–1 win in the 1874–75 FA Cup third round win over the Wanderers.  He kept his place for the ties against the Royal Engineers at the semi-final stage, playing as a right-side forward.\nHis only appearance in the 1875–76 FA Cup was in the surprise fourth round defeat to the Old Etonians, although he did appear in the Varsity match for the only time that season; despite Oxford being down to 10 men through injury for much of the match, the Dark Blues beat Cambridge University 4–1. Fernandez clinched the victory with the fourth goal ten minutes from time, \"mugging\" the Cambridge backs, who had paused, assuming there would be a claim for hand-ball made against them.\nIn the 1876–77 season, he only played twice, both times in the 1876–77 FA Cup; the first time in the replay win over Upton Park at the Kennington Oval in the last 5 stage, and the second time in the final defeat to the Wanderers, again on the right, with captain Edward Parry.  His graduation made him ineligible for the university side afterwards, and there is no record of him playing football again at any reportable level.\n\n\n== Post-university ==\nIn 1882 he became the assistant-master of Uppingham School. In 1886 he was ordained as a Church of England vicar, and was first sent to South Africa, where until 1897 he held curacies in Maritzburg and Natal. From 1912 to 1918 he was the vicar of Hewelsfield in the diocese of Gloucester, and from 1918 to 1926 of Dewsall in the diocese of Hereford.  From 1927 to 1932, he lived in Monkton Combe, in Somerset, where he died of pneumonia following a bout of sunstroke.  He left a widow, Annie (née Leighton), whom he married in Hewesfield in 1913.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Office of Differential Exchange Regime (RECADI) was an currency exchange control system in Venezuela implemented during the government of Luis Herrera Campíns that operated between 28 February 1983 (ten days after Viernes Negro) and 10 February 1989 to regulate the delivery of foreign currency. It was established to administer a system of differential exchange rates and capital controls.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 15 June 1987, in compliance with Presidential Decree No. 1,544, RECADI ceased its functions; foreign currency purchase and sale operations, still restricted by the government, became directly administered by the Ministry of Finance. The system was dissolved in 1989, when the differential exchange rate system was abolished. On 24 February, an investigation was opened by presidential order against RECADI for alleged financial fraud. RECADI constituted a break in the highlight of Venezuelan corruption, and became a major scandal in 1989 when five former ministers were arrested. However, the charges were later dropped.\nSince Black Friday, it represents a milestone that changed its economic history. Until that day, the stability and reliability that had characterized the bolivar since the second decade of the XX century, whose last free exchange rate against the dollar was at a fixed value of 4.30 bolivars, was officially maintained. Since then, the constant devaluation of the bolivar, complications with the payment of the foreign debt, the accelerated deterioration of the purchasing power and the implementation of RECADI made the stability of the Venezuelan currency disappear.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHo Fuk Wing\nNational Center for Foreign Commerce\nCorruption in Venezuela\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anthony Joseph \"Tony\" Abruzzo (1916–1990) was an American comic book artist. He is best known for his work in the romance comics field for National Periodicals (later DC Comics), particularly Girls' Love Stories, for which he illustrated stories continuously from 1954 to 1972. In the early 1960s, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein derived many of his best-known works from the panels of romance comics that had been illustrated by Abruzzo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nAnthony Joseph Abruzzo was born in 1916 in New York City, the child of Sicilian immigrant Antonio Abruzzo Jr. and Amelia (Mildred) Kehnle. Tony Abruzzo's father was an underemployed professional entertainer, and he grew up amidst familial tension as his parents' marriage deteriorated. After their divorce, he lived with his mother, who remarried a man named Louis Priore, in Ozone Park, Queens. Meanwhile, Anthony's father remarried a woman named Evelyn Hayes.Young Tony flourished, embracing a diverse array of activities at Alexander Hamilton High School in Brooklyn. His involvement in the school's drama society garnered attention, as did his poetry, which was entered into an annual national writing competition sponsored by Scholastic magazine. Four of Abruzzo's poems were published in the 1933 edition of Scholastic's Saplings.Abruzzo trained at the Traphagen School of Fashion, and initially gained recognition as a dress designer. He also ventured into fashion advertisement design and harbored aspirations of moving to Paris to pursue a career in fashion. From Traphagen, Abruzzo moved to the Pratt Institute, receiving a certificate in pictorial illustration from Pratt in April 1937.\n\n\n=== Army service ===\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted Abruzzo's plans as he was drafted into the U.S. Army. During his military service, at Fort Knox near Louisville, Kentucky, he illustrated tanks, scout cars, and jeeps for specialized Armored Force training manuals. While in the Army, he was the subject of a number of news articles about his diverse drawing talents. He also began publishing comics in the Army, including a comic strip called Randy Allen, both in Armored Force News and Army Times.\nIn 1944, Abruzzo's comic strip work was exhibited as part of a group show at Louisville's historic Brown Hotel, sponsored by the Courier-Journal, The Louisville Times, and the Kentucky Press Association. Abruzzo left the Army with the rank of sergeant.\n\n\n=== Comics career ===\nAfter the war, Abruzzo found work as a comic book artist, initially for the Christian publisher Standard Publishing (based in Cincinnati). Comics Abruzzo worked on in 1946–1947 included Mission: Rescue!, Parables Jesus Told, and Life of Esther Visualized, all written by Dorothy Fay Foster.By the early 1950s, Abruzzo had transitioned to working as a comic book artist for National Periodicals (the predecessor of DC Comics). His background in the fashion industry positioned him as a fitting artist for the company's extensive array of romance titles. Abruzzo’s earliest signed artwork in a romance comic was in Secret Hearts #12 (Oct.-Nov. 1952), published by Beverly Publishing, a National imprint. Throughout the early 1970s, Abruzzo illustrated numerous love stories featuring captivating female protagonists in titles such as Girls' Love Stories, Girls' Romances, Secret Hearts, Young Love, Young Romance, and Falling in Love. Robert Kanigher, a long-time DC editor, said of Abruzzo, that he was, \"The finest artist in the romance field, bar none.\"\n\n\n=== Personal life and death ===\nAbruzzo died in Brooklyn, New York, on December 30, 1990, at age 74. He never married.\n\n\n== Abruzzo and Lichtenstein ==\nRoy Lichtenstein made a splash in the 1960s with his pop art \"appropriations\" based on the work of Abruzzo and other comic book artists, who rarely received any credit. One of Lichtenstein's most well-known works, Drowning Girl (1963), was adapted from the splash page of \"Run for Love!\", illustrated by Abruzzo and lettered by Ira Schnapp, in Secret Hearts #83 (DC Comics, November 1962). Critics have noted that the waves in Lichtenstein's image are intended to \"recall Hokusai as well as the biomorphic forms of Arp and Miró;\" just as Abruzzo's art may have intended to.  Lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between Abruzzo's original panel and Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa, making this work a bridge between the two.Notable other examples of Lichtenstein works based on Abruzzo's art include:\n\nCrying Girl (1963) — adapted from \"Escape from Loneliness,\" penciled by Abruzzo and inked by Bernard Sachs, in Secret Hearts #88 (DC Comics, June 1963)\nHopeless (1963) — adapted from a panel from the same story, \"Run for Love!\", artwork by Abruzzo and lettered by Schnapp, in Secret Hearts #83 (November 1962)\nIn the Car (sometimes called Driving) (1963) — adapted from an Abruzzo panel in Girls' Romances #78 (DC, September 1961)\nOh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But... (1964)\nOhhh...Alright... (1964) —  also derived from Secret Hearts #88 (June 1963)\nSleeping Girl (1964) — based on an Abruzzo panel from Girls' Romances #105 (October 1964)Jack Cowart, executive director of the Lichtenstein Foundation, contests the notion that Lichtenstein was a copyist, saying: \"Roy's work was a wonderment of the graphic formulae and the codification of sentiment that had been worked out by others. The panels were changed in scale, color, treatment, and in their implications. There is no exact copy.\" Comics industry figures don't have such a sanguine attitude about Lichtenstein's swipes.In 2013, Abruzzo's artwork was exhibited as part of the show \"Image Duplicator\", curated by Rian Hughes and Jason Atomic, at Orbital Comics in London. The exhibition involved cartoonists \"re-appropriating the works of Roy Lichtenstein, tracking them back to their original source material and then creating a new comic book image that credits the original artist.\" Abruzzo was one of the artists featured, alongside the likes of Dave Gibbons, Rian Hughes, Salgood Sam, Steven Cook, and Howard Chaykin.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGravett, Paul (March 17, 2013). \"The Principality of Lichtenstein: From 'WHAAM!' to 'WHAAT?'\".

        "content": "Juan Manuel Montilla Macarrón (born 1 November 1979), better known as El Langui, is a Spanish rapper and actor. He was a member of musical trio La Excepción.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJuan Manuel Montilla Macarrón was born in Madrid on 1 November 1979 and was raised in Pan Bendito, a southern area of Madrid. Due to lack of oxygen during childbirth, he suffers from cerebral palsy, which caused him a motor disorder of spasticity.\nTogether with Gitano Antón and Ladako Style, El Langui founded the hip-hop trio La Excepción. La Excepción won Best Spanish Act at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards.\nHe made his feature film acting debut in The One-Handed Trick (2008) portraying Cuajo, a young man with palsy who fights for his dream of setting up a film studio. He won a Goya Award for Best New Actor and a Goya Award for Best Original Song for his work in the film. He has since featured in films such as Que baje Dios y lo vea, La cripta, el último secreto, or La familia Benetón and series such as Cuerpo de élite and 30 Coins.\nHis solo musical career beyond La Excepción includes the release of two albums: Hola (2015) and Espasticidad (2022).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sikh copper-plate inscriptions (Tamar Patar) are historical Sikh inscribed copper plates that were commissioned by Guru Gobind Singh and gifted by him to three-known Hindu temples during his guruship period.: 302 : 240–242  Three inscribed copper plates of this kind are known.: 302 : 240–242 \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe copper plates were etched in the Gurmukhi script by the sevadars or scribes in the service of the tenth Sikh guru.: 302  They were likely created by blacksmiths serving the Sikh court, who then printed the inscriptions on the plate.: 240–242  The Sikh guru gave the command for the commissioning of a copper plate in the morning-time, leaving the blacksmiths to create the product and paraphrase the Guru's command to writing in the form of the inscriptions present on the plates.: 240–242  When the copper plate was ready, it was bestowed to a local priest of the temple.: 240–242 \nIt had been a custom of the Rajput Rajas, of the Punjab Pahari Hills region, to commission and gift inscribed copper plates to Hindu temples falling within the jurisdiction of their polity.: 302  Guru Gobind Singh, who had been becoming more influential in the regions of Paonta and Anandpur, emulated the Hill Rajas by commissioning and gifting his own copper plates to prominent Hindu temples in the area his entourage resided in.: 302  By adopting and imitating local royal customs of the region, this was a sign of the growing power and influence of the Sikh guru.: 302 : 240–242  The temples of particular regions accepting copper plates issued by the Sikh guru served as a symbol of their \"formal submission to Sikh authority\".: 240–242 \nThe inscribed copper plates were brought to the light of mainstream Sikh Studies through the research and fieldwork of Gurinder Singh Mann.: 240–242  The inscribed copper plates of this region and era served as a symbol of political patronage, benevolence, and authority.: 240–242  Between the years 1650 to 1725, twenty-six extant examples of such copper plates are known, which were gifted by local Hill polities to Hindu temples in the Naina Devi region.: 240–242  The current familial custodians of the Sikh-commissioned copper plates all vouch for their authenticity and have preserved them due to their importance related to the sites they were gifted to.: 240–242 \n\n\n=== Naina Devi ===\nThe Naina Devi temple near Paonta was a recipient of a copper plate by the Sikh guru.: 302  The presentation of this inscribed copper plate to the Naina Devi temple is recorded in a late 18th-century Sikh text called Sudharam Marag Granth ('Book of the Good Religious Path').: 240–242  This source asserts that Guru Gobind Singh gifted the copper plate to a Brahmin of Naina Devi named Bhadia while the guru visited the temple. Bhadia was the head priest of a Havan ceremony being performed and had been paid 100,000 rupees by the Sikh guru. However, Bhadia rejected this monetary sum and requested that the guru gift him something that will last for a long-time and survive throughout the generations to be revered. As a result, the Sikh guru bestowed an inscribed copper plate, with its inscription in the form of a Hukam edict, to the Brahmin of Naina Devi instead. The inscription etched on this copper plate was scribed in the Anandpuri Lipi style of Gurmukhi.: 240–242  This style of Gurmukhi script can also be found in Hukamnama manuscripts and Khas Patra pages of historical manuscripts of the Dasam Granth, which had been handwritten by the Sikh guru himself.: 182  Contemporary Sikh sources make no mention of the issuing of an inscribed copper plate to the Naina Devi temple by the Sikh guru.: 240–242 \nA translation of the inscription of the copper plate is rendered as follows:: 240 \n\nSalutations to Naina (Namo Naine). Bhadia is our priest (purohit). Those who follow us should acknowledge him.\nThe Naina Devi copper plate was examined by G. S. Mann in the Summer of 2000.: 240–242  Mann discovered that the name 'Bhadia' does appear in the genealogical records (kursinama) of the current custodians of the copper plate and traced the year this ancestor would have flourished to the year 1700 based on generational counts and lengths.: 240–242 \n\n\n=== Kapal Mochan ===\n\nA Shiva temple in Kapal Mochan, located near Anandpur, had been gifted a copper plate by Guru Gobind Singh.: 302  It had been recently rediscovered.: 172  Kapal Mochan was visited by the tenth Guru when he travelled between Paonta and Anandpur.: 172  The copper plate was bestowed to the temple in the year 1679 and was a sign of the Sikh guru's interest in ruling near the area.: xxiv : 240–242  The inscription on this copper plate contains the Ardaas supplication.: 240–242  The inscribed copper plate employs regular (non-calligraphic) Gurmukhi font rather than Anandpuri Lipi.: 240–242  Curiously, the guru's name is inscribed as 'Guru Gobind Singh', containing the Singh appellation, even though the copper plate was issued to the temple in 1679, twenty years before the traditional dating of 1699 for the establishment of the Khalsa Panth. This has been used as evidence that the Khalsa may have been established earlier or at-least there were pre-cursory features of it already present amongst the Sikhs before 1699. G. S. Mann asserts that this is evidence that the tenth Guru had adopted the 'Singh' title earlier in the year 1675.: 240–242 \nA translation of the inscription of the copper plate is rendered as follows:: 241 \n\nOne God, with the grace of the Guru. The Khalsa belongs to the Immortal one. Guru Gobind Singh bestowed the hukamnama on Jawala Das Brahman [Brahmin] on Tuesday, October 14, 1679. My Sikh, who will follow this hukamnama, will be blessed.\nThe current custodians of the copper plate claim the Sikh guru visited the Kapal Mochan temple two times, with the visits taking place in 1679 and 1688 respectively.: 240–242  According to them, while the Guru gifted an inscribed copper plate in 1679, he also gifted an illuminated Hukamnama document during his 1688 visit to the premises.: 240–242  A contemporary Sikh account of the guru's 1688 visit to the temple makes no reference to the gifting of a Hukamnama.: 240–242 \n\n\n=== Kurukshetra ===\nA temple located in Kurukshetra also received an inscribed copper plate from the Sikh guru.: 302  However, the inscribed copper plate was lost in early 1980 while it was being displayed in a local gurdwara and no photographs or etchings of its inscription are known to exist or be publicly available, rendering its contents unknown.: 269–270  The former, familial custodians of the plate also claimed to have had in their possession a Hukamnama document gifted to them by the tenth Sikh guru, however it was confiscated by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee in the 1970s.: 269–270 \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The series, consisting of a total of 6 seasons, is in its 199th episode, which was released on June 15, 2021. It appeared on the screens for the last time with the episode to make the season finale, and was taken off the air in October 2021 due to the disagreement between ATV and the series team.\n\n\n== About the series' transition to digital ==\nWe shook hands with BluTV for the continuation of the series. First of all, the 200th edition, which was ready but not published. The episode will be a movie with renewed montage and additional scenes. The new name of the project, whose naming rights belong to ATV, is \"The Last Legend\". On the other hand, the TV series version of the project will be shot in February and the successful actor Ozan Akbaba, who plays İlyas Çakırbeyli, will be in the leading role. Oktay Kaynarca, the character of Hızır in the series, is in prison, and Yunus Emre Yıldırımer, the character of Alpaslan, will not appear in the series because he will be shown in exile abroad.\nFollowing this development, ATV announced that it would file a lawsuit against BVB Yapım for 165 million. According to the news circulating behind the scenes, BluTV withdrew from its contract with BVB Yapım after ATV was preparing to file a lawsuit.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRaci Şaşmaz, who co-wrote the series with Bahadır Özdener for 3 seasons, could not pay the salaries of the actors in 2019 and had to transfer the production to ATV İç Yapımlar. Bahadır Özdener continued to write the series script together with Berna Aruz. 7th of the series. The first episode of the season is 200. The episode was shot, but as a result of the discussions between ATV managers Ömer Numanoğlu and Bahadır Özdener, the tape was not delivered on October 26, 2021, and the episode was not broadcast.

        "content": "Un Mechón de Pelo (stylized in all lowercase) (transl. A Lock of Hair) is the fifth studio album by Argentine singer Tini, released on 11 April 2024, by 5020 Records and Sony Music Latin. Tini co-wrote all the songs on the album, and its production was mostly handled by her longtime colaborators Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo, along with Felipe Contreras and Zecca. It is her first album to contain no features or collaborations.\nTini conceived the album shortly after finishing work on Cupido (2023) and continued developing it during her third concert tour, Tini Tour (2022–2023). Primarily spoken word record, it also incorporates elements of  alternative pop, electronica music, rock en español and latin R&B, mainly consisting of uptempo tunes and downtempo ballads. Inspired by her personal struggles, it was described as Tini's most personal record up to that point, with its lyrical content reflecting on vulnerability, pain, resilience, renewal and growth.\nThree singles were released from Un Mechón de Pelo. \"Pa\" was released on 1 April 2024 as the album's lead single. \"Posta\" and \"Buenos Aires\" were released as the second and third singles from the album, respectively.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTini's fourth studio album, Cupido, was released on 16 February 2023. The album was a commercial success and was met with a generally positive critical response. The record yielded multiple singles including the Argentina Hot 100 number-ones \"Miénteme\", \"Bar\", and \"La Triple T\". It made Stoessel the first Argentine act since Miguel Caló in 2016 to debut in the top ten of Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart. Cupido was certified double platinum (Latin) in the United States by the RIAA. Tini embarked on the Tini Tour in support of the album and its predecessor Tini Tini Tini (2020), which included 60 shows across South America, North America, and Europe, from May 2022 to November 2023.\nIn March 2023, Tini revealed that she was working on new music. Recording sessions began that month with Tini working with longtime producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo. In an interview with El Diaro in November 2023, Tini revealed that personal struggles that she had over the past few years had predominantly influenced her new album. She stated that she wanted to \"open up\" to the public via the album, which she revealed would sonically mark a departure from the sound of her previous music. In February 2024, Stoessel won the Premio Lo Nuestro award for Urban/Pop Album of the Year for Cupido; in her acceptance speech, she revealed that her next musical project was imminent which she \"never imagined\" she \"would [have dared]\" to make.\nIn anticipation of new music, Tini blanked out her social media on 15 March 2024 and shared a picture of a floor full of strands of cut hair to her Instagram Stories. Over the next few days, she posted images from a photoshoot set against a bathroom backdrop; they depicted the procedure of her hair makeover to blonde. On 23 March, she previewed new music. On 26 March 2024, Tini announced her fifth studio album, titled Un Mechón de Pelo, and its release date via her social media. The announcement was accompanied with a promotional image of her looking into the mirror.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n=== Music and lyrics ===\nUn Mechón de Pelo is a spoken word record with many influences of alternative pop and electronica music. It explores a diversity of other music genres, including latin pop, rock en español and latin R&B. The album also include uptempo songs and ballads. Rolling Stone stated that the \"Un Mechón de Pelo presents a straightforward look at Tini grappling with the complexities of being in the limelight from an early age, dealing with crippling mental health issues, and, by the end, convincing herself that she’ll be alright\". Griselda Flores from Billboard noted that it is \"star's most personal project yet\". Lyrically the album's set follows Tini on moments of vulnerability, pain, resilience, renewal and growth.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\nThe album begins with it's lead singe \"Pa\", thrilling and emotional ballad, where she shares the fear she felt after nearly losing her father. In the song, she pleads for “un ratito más,” or a little while longer with her dad. The next track \"Posta\" is a electronica song with elements of latin R&B, where she clarifies who she is and isn’t. In this track, Tini spoke about her struggles with balancing her artistic persona and her own identity, on which she repeats the assumptions people “have thrown at me for years.” The third track \"Miedo\", begins with choral singing with a lot of echo and, when Tini's voice emerges, with the epistolary format of the song. The theme is a  letter in which she reflects on holding on to a memory and not letting it go. The lyrics expose Tini's feelings: \"I escaped from my reality, I locked myself in my loneliness.\" The last verse, capturing the \"fear of not finding the words\" and of a calm that did not return. The fourth track \"Ni de Ti\" is the album’s standout. It’s a scathing track aimed at her detractors. The song evokes chaos with the musical base, and refers to the lies that were invented about it and although, without giving names, about what was her relationship with Rodrigo De Paul, involving Cami Homs. This frenetic tempo contrasts with different audios of her grandmother throughout the song. It also includes an extensive dialogue from the artist. On fifth track \"Ángel\", she returns to healing that inner child, and interrupts a piano ballad with a rap to share her family’s side of the headline-making rupture and legal battle between her father Alejandro Stoessel and famed TV host Marcelo Tinelli over the intellectual property of Disney Channel show Patito Feo, the series Tini got her start in back in 2008. In the song, she claims Tinelli lied about her father and instead of his status helping her get her breakthrough role on Violetta, as many assumed, Disney “didn’t even want to hire” her because of it.\nThe six track of the album \"Buenos Aires\" is a ballad, backed by acoustic guitar, that has managed to capture the feeling of pain in its music video clip. At the beginning of the video we see Tini looking out the window, with her lost gaze. At her feet, in the city, we see Tini with a new 'look' doing activities with a more confident attitude and, despite being alone down there, she keeps going. Album's eight track \"Ellas\" was the very first song she released, even if it was a fragment of it. When Tini deleted all of her Instagram posts and ushered in her new album era, her first 'post', in which she made reference to her new project, included the beginning of 'ellas'. It is a short song, but it says a lot. The beginning is a succession of audios of close women, hence the title of the song, supporting the artist in her toughest moments mentally. The song is a  token of gratitude for putting yourself in her shoes and understanding the bad mental state she was going through. The album's seventh track \"Tinta 90\", a reference to her signature hair color, Tini sings about dealing with her mental health in private and how those around her didn’t even realize she was suffering. “Only the two of us know what we went through,” she sings using female pronouns in Spanish. She stated that \"that’s me speaking to myself and my brain\". \nAn upbeat ninth album's track \"Bien\" hears Tini exit a stormy mindset. The song includes the phrase \"Un Mechón de Pelo\" that appears in the album title. Here Tini shows us her personal improvement and that \"not everything has to be fine\" and \"that it is fine if you are not fine.\" A  lesson of learning and growth that, at marked rhythms, puts an end to that story that began tragically. The tenth track \"Me Voy\" closes the album and the whole story that Tini wanted to show with the album Un Mechón de Pelo. This theme refers to the key point in which Tini leaves past events behind and \"leaves\": \"I have time to change my destiny and although I am afraid of love, now I feel better.\" On this track, the singer leaves the old Tini behind. She’s no longer letting anyone tell her who she noting: \"It used to cause me so much panic to not say some things. Sometimes, to build the courage to speak, you need time. You need to process,” she says. “The album explains every point I’m trying to get at… And whoever wants to understand it, will. Whoever doesn’t, won’t.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nUn Mechón de Pelo was released on 11 April 2024 via 5020 Records and Sony Music Latin. The album was issued via digital download and streaming. It was promoted by digital service providers such as Apple Music and Spotify. Following its announcement, a trailer for the album was released to Tini's social media and YouTube channel on 27 March 2024. It features Tini quietly sobbing while she cuts her hair, with a voiceover by her of her thoughts on themes of mental health. The cover artwork and tracklist of the album were unveiled the day after. The same day the album was available for preorder.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Pa\" was released on 1 April 2024 as the lead single from the album.\n\"Posta\" was released on 4 April 2024 as the second single.\n\"Buenos Aires\" was released on 9 April 2024, as the thrid single.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nUn Mechón de Pelo received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Thania Garcia from Variety stated that it is \"a concept album that touches on topics ranging from mental health to the evolution of her career as an actor and singer-songwriter. [...] Tini opens the pages of her diary to tell a story about resilience and renewal and also serves as a tribute to her love and admiration for her father\". Melanie Cordero of Los 40 notes that \"In this piece the artist explores the pain, anguish, fear and shock she felt in one of the most difficult moments of her life. Her showing the most vulnerable side of her by allowing her fans to immerse themselves in the introspective path of her art [...] each topic represents a chapter of resilience and evolution. That immerses listeners in a universe of emotions and culminates on their path to peace\". Rolling Stone noted that \"[The album] is a catharsis, and a far cry from the profit-pulling project some critics made it out to be\". Celeste Sawczuk from Infobae stated that the album \"is a melodic letter about her own healing process\". Diario Río Negro called the album a \"perfect project\" and added that it's \"very well articulated, to usher in a new era, in which [Tini] makes a clean slate, opening the doors to her best version\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks written by Martina Stoessel, Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo, and produced by the latter two, except where noted.\n\nNotes\n\nAll tracks are stylized in all lowercase.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMartina Stoessel – lead vocals, background vocals\nAndrés Torres  – keyboards, guitar, programming, engineering\nMauricio Rengifo  – background vocals, keyboards, programming, engineering\nTom Norris  –  mixing\nLewis Pickett – mixing\nFrancisco Zecca  – engineering\nCamilo Zeea  – engineering\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thriftimart  was an American chain of supermarkets in Greater Los Angeles until 1984, founded by Roger M. Laverty. Many stores continue to operate as Smart & Final stores, now owned by Mexico City-based Chedraui. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== As Fitzsimmons Markets, Ltd. (1930-1957) ===\nRoger Montgomery Laverty was born in 1890 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1930, Laverty was vice president of the Central Division of the A&P, the largest U.S. grocery chain at the time. He and a group of colleagues bought Fitzsimmons Stores, Ltd., a small Los Angeles chain of markets. In 1939, Fitzsimmons acquired 9 Thriftimart stores, then in 1947, Laverty bought Thriftimart Inc. and the combined company kept the Fitzsimmons Stores, Ltd. name. In 1948, sales at Fitzsimmons Stores Ltd. amounted to $19,931,475.\nIn 1949, Fitzsimmons Stores Ltd. acquired Fred Roberts & Co. which operated Roberts Markets, a 19-store Los Angeles-based chain, as well as 15 liquor stores. Roberts' 1948 sales were $18,889,948, just under Fitzsimmons' numbers for that year.\nIn 1954, Fitzsimmons acquired the large, 44,000 sq ft (4,100 m2) Big Owl supermarket at Valley Plaza in North Hollywood, which was rebranded Thriftimart. Big Owl had been a project of the Owl Drug Company, which stated that it had completed extensive research on shoppers' in-store behavior, the results of which it used to create a \"revolutionary\" store layout for Big Owl that would shorten the amount of walking required to complete a typical shopping trip. With the aim of providing the convenience of one-stop shopping, Big Owl also incorporated stores-in-store, which was uncommon at the time, including Van de Kamp's Bakeries, See's Candies, a \"soda grill\" for quick meals and snacks, a barber, cleaners, watch repair, and sales of china and gift items. It had 12 checkout lanes with electric cash registers, where shoppers could pay for good from all the departments (a relatively recent innovation in markets at the time), 9 entrances for the public, and its parking lot had space for 750 cars. Through a window, customers could watch meat be packed in cellophane, weighed, labeled and marked with a price, then watch a \"tremendous, store-long\" conveyor belt transport it to refrigerated cases in the store's meat sales area. Big Owl stated that its neon sign was the brightest in the U.S. west of Chicago.Fitzsimmons Stores, Ltd. bought the \"Smart & Final Iris\" company and its cash-and-carry (wholesale) stores in 1955.\n\n\n=== As Thriftimart, Inc. (1957–1984) ===\nIn 1957, Fitzsimmons Stores Ltd. had changed its name to Thriftimart, Inc., saying that Thriftimart had \"come to mean leadership in the grocery field\" and that it was for that reason most appropriate that the firm bear the Thriftimart name. At the time there were 43 Thriftimart-branded stores in addition to Fitzsimmons-branded stores.\nAs Greater Los Angeles grew, so did Thriftimart, Inc. There were 50 Thriftimart retail grocery stores in May 1960: 44 in Los Angeles County (including 1 in Lancaster), plus 1 in Riverside, 1 in San Bernardino County (Colton), 2 in Bakersfield and 2 in Las Vegas. \nThis grew to 56 (and 3,000 employees) by October 1960 and 77 by 1971, and 79 (plus 86 cash-and-carry and 5 warehouses) in 1976.In 1968, son Robert Edward Laverty became president and chairman of the board.Thriftimart opened its last new store in 1971. By 1983, the by then 43-store Thriftimart chain determined that it could not adapt to the trend towards larger supermarkets. Its stores measured on average 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) while others' averaged 45,000 sq ft (4,200 m2). Thriftimart stated that it had looked for a buyer, but of the major local chains — Boys, Hughes, Lucky, Ralphs, Safeway, and Vons — none was interested.\n\n\n=== As Smart & Final Iris Co. (1984–) ===\nIn 1984, Thriftimart, Inc. changed its name to Smart & Final Iris Co. In June of that year, Casino USA Inc. acquired the 8.3% stake in the Class A shares of Thriftimart Inc. owned by movie theater executives Michael Forman and James Cotter.On March 1, 1984, Thriftimart announced that it would sell 23 of its then 40 stores to Oakland-based Safeway Stores, Inc. which operated about 2,500 supermarkets but had relatively weak coverage in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, ranking #5 in 1983, trailing Ralphs, Vons, Lucky and Alpha Beta. 17 Thriftimart stores remained.In September of that year, Casino gained control of Smart & Final Iris (i.e. the former Thriftimart, Inc.) by acquiring the combined 87% of the company's Class B stock owned by the founder's children Roger Laverty II, Robert Laverty, and Nancy Harris for $75 million. Class B shareholders controlled 5 of the company's 9 board seats.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThriftimart discussion page on Groceteria blog",

        "content": "Section 20 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (French: article 20 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867) is a repealed provision of the Constitution of Canada, which required annual sittings of the Parliament of Canada. It was repealed in 1982 and replaced by a similar provision in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is the constitutional statute which established Canada.  Originally named the British North America Act, 1867, the Act continues to be the foundational statute for the Constitution of Canada, although it has been amended many times since 1867.  It is now recognised as part of the supreme law of Canada.\n\n\n== Constitution Act, 1867 ==\n\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is part of the Constitution of Canada and thus part of the supreme law of Canada. The Act sets out the constitutional framework of Canada, including the structure of the  federal government and the powers of the federal government and the provinces. It was the product of extensive negotiations between the provinces of British North America at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, the Quebec Conference in 1864, and the London Conference in 1866. Those conferences were followed by consultations with the British government in 1867.   The Act was then enacted in 1867 by the British Parliament under the name the British North America Act, 1867. In 1982 the Act was brought under full Canadian control through the Patriation of the Constitution, and was renamed the Constitution Act, 1867. Since Patriation the Act can only be amended in Canada, under the amending formula set out in the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\n\n== Text of section 20 ==\nSection 20 has been repealed.  As originally enacted in 1867, it read:\n\nYearly Session of the Parliament of Canada20 There shall be a Session of the Parliament of Canada once at least in every Year, so that Twelve Months shall not intervene between the last Sitting of the Parliament in one Session and its first Sitting in the next Session.\nSection 20 was found in Part IV of the Constitution Act, 1867, dealing with the federal legislative power.\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nSection 20 had its origins in the similar provisions in pre-Confederation Canada.\nIn 1791, the British Parliament passed the Constitutional Act 1791, which split the old Province of Quebec into Lower Canada and Upper Canada.  Both of the new provinces had its own parliament, and each was required to meet annually.  This provision in turn was carried forward in the Union Act 1840, which reunited the two provinces into the Province of Canada.\nThe requirement for an annual sitting of Parliament was set out in resolution 28 of the Quebec Resolutions, produced by the Fathers of Confederation at the Quebec Conference in 1864.  The provision was continued as resolution 27 of the London Resolutions at the London Conference in 1866. It was included in the rough draft of the bill, modified in the initial draft, and took final form in the final draft.  It was then included as section 20 in the Constitution Act, 1867.\nSection 20 only required annual sittings of Parliament, and did not apply to the provincial legislatures.  It was repealed in 1982 on the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was replaced by section 5 of the Charter, which requires that Parliament and each provincial legislature must sit at least once every twelve months.\n\n\n== Purpose and interpretation ==\nThe requirement for annual meetings of Parliament evolved gradually in England and then Great Britain.  The Triennial Acts, passed in the 17th century, established that Parliament must be elected at least once every three years.  The need for the government to pass financial measures had the practical effect of requiring that Parliaments actually meet at least once a year, although that requirement was not included in the Triennial Act 1694.  Section 20 codified the British practice.\n\n\n== Related provisions ==\nSection 50 of the Act provides that the House of Commons shall not last for more than five years from the last election.\nSection 5 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires annual sittings of Parliament and the provincial legislatures.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Section 16 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (French: article 16 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867) is a provision of the Constitution of Canada, making Ottawa the seat of government of Canada.\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is the constitutional statute which established Canada.  Originally named the British North America Act, 1867, the Act continues to be the foundational statute for the Constitution of Canada, although it has been amended many times since 1867.  It is now recognised as part of the supreme law of Canada.\n\n\n== Constitution Act, 1867 ==\n\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is part of the Constitution of Canada and thus part of the supreme law of Canada.  The Act sets out the constitutional framework of Canada, including the structure of the  federal government and the powers of the federal government and the provinces. It was the product of extensive negotiations between the provinces of British North America at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, the Quebec Conference in 1864, and the London Conference in 1866. Those conferences were followed by consultations with the British government in 1867.   The Act was then enacted in 1867 by the British Parliament under the name the British North America Act, 1867. In 1982 the Act was brought under full Canadian control through the Patriation of the Constitution, and was renamed the Constitution Act, 1867.  Since Patriation the Act can only be amended in Canada, under the amending formula set out in the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\n\n== Text of section 16 ==\nSection 16 reads:\n\nSeat of Government of Canada 16 Until the Queen otherwise directs, the Seat of Government of Canada shall be Ottawa.\nSection 16 is found in Part III of the Constitution Act, 1867, dealing with the executive power of the federal government.\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nOne issue which needed to be addressed for the new country was the location of the seat of government. Both the Quebec Resolutions and the London Resolutions provided that the seat of government should be Ottawa, but stated that the designation of the seat of government was \"subject to the Royal Prerogative\".\nDuring the drafting of the bill, this provision first appeared in the fourth draft, which continued to refer to the royal prerogative.  The section took its current wording in the final draft of the bill, which gave the Queen the statutory power to direct a different location, rather than citing the royal prerogative.\nSection 16 has not been amended since the Act was enacted in 1867.\n\n\n== Purpose and interpretation ==\n\n\n=== Previous dispute about the seat of government ===\n\nThe choice of a seat of government had been a major political issue in the Province of Canada, resulting in an itinerant parliament over the course of twenty-five years, a referral of the issue to Queen Victoria, and the fall of the Canadian government in 1858.\nFrom 1841 to 1866, the seat of government of the Province of Canada had relocated seven times, to five different cities: Kingston (1841 to 1843); Montreal (1843 to 1849); Toronto (1850 to 1851); Quebec City (1852 to 1854); Toronto again (1855 to 1859); Quebec City again (1860 to 1865), and finally Ottawa (1866). Each of these relocations had triggered significant political debates, as there were strong regional feelings concerning the location of the seat of government.\n\n\n==== Decision deferred to Queen Victoria ====\n\nIn 1857, the issue came up again in the Parliament of the Province of Canada. John A. Macdonald, the leader of the Liberal-Conservatives from Canada West (now Ontario), and George-Étienne Cartier, the leader of the conservative Bleus from Canada East (now Quebec), were convinced that the issue of the seat of government had to be removed from Canadian politics to keep the Province of Canada together, so strong were the regional loyalties. Even their own Cabinet was divided on the issue, as Macdonald admitted in the Legislative Assembly.\nTo resolve the impasse, Macdonald and Cartier proposed that Queen Victoria be asked to determine the location of the seat of government.  That proposal passed in the Legislative Assembly, but was controversial. The Globe newspaper in Toronto, published by one of the leading Reform party members, George Brown, condemned the decision, saying that it amounted to a vote \"to destroy responsible government by sending to Downing Street for Mr Labouchere [the Colonial Secretary] to fix the seat of government.\"  For a short time, however, this approach removed the seat-of-government issue from Canadian politics.\n\n\n==== The Queen chooses Ottawa, 1857 ====\n\nAfter the passage of the resolution by the Assembly, the Governor General, Sir Edmund Head, prepared a confidential memorandum, considering the claims of each of the cities to be named as the seat of government.  He recommended that Ottawa be chosen, in part because of its location on the boundary between Canada East and Canada West, which he thought would satisfy some of the regional tensions.  He also relied on a military consideration:  Ottawa was located a considerable distance from the United States, unlike Toronto, Kingston and Montreal.\nHead then went to London to explain his recommendation to the British government.  The Colonial Secretary, Henry Labouchere, agreed with Head's position and recommended Ottawa to Queen Victoria.  The Prince Consort, Prince Albert, also favoured Ottawa.  Late in 1857, the Queen made her decision, in favour of Ottawa.\n\n\n==== Fall of the Canadian government, 1858 ====\n\nThe Queen's choice did not end the dispute, and gave rise to a complicated political episode, the Double Shuffle.  In the parliamentary session in 1858, the Macdonald–Cartier government introduced a motion to authorise funding to build parliament buildings at Ottawa.  The opposition, led by Antoine-Aimé Dorion and George Brown, opposed the proposal, and the government was defeated in the Assembly on the issue.  The Macdonald–Cartier government treated the defeat as a matter of confidence and resigned.  Brown and Dorion formed a government, but within a few days, they too were defeated and also had to resign. In the interval, Macdonald and Cartier were able to find support in the Assembly and were reappointed by Governor General Head.\nThe next year, 1859, the Cartier–Macdonald government returned to the issue.  This time, after a bitter debate lasting two weeks, they were able to carry the motion for the construction of the new parliament buildings in Ottawa, in an exchange for a commitment that the Parliament would sit at Quebec City until the new buildings were ready in Ottawa.  Even that was not the end of the debate.  There was one final attempt in the parliamentary session of 1860 to re-open the question, but this time it was defeated by a strong majority in the Assembly.\n\n\n=== Construction of Parliament buildings ===\n\nConstruction of the new parliament buildings began in 1860.  Progress was initially fast, but the construction was temporarily halted in 1862 because of large cost overruns.  A public inquiry was held, which found various faults with the construction process, but recommended that the original architects and builders be allowed to continue the project.  By the time the buildings were completed in 1865, the total cost was $2,591,760, a considerable cost overrun from the original budget of £225,000 (equivalent to $1,094,985 at the statutory conversion rate then in use).\nThe last session of the Parliament of the Province of Canada was held in Ottawa in 1866.\n\n\n=== Fathers of Confederation choose Ottawa ===\n\nWith that history of political conflict, and the cost of the new Parliament buildings, it was not surprising that the delegates to the Quebec Conference agreed on Ottawa as the seat of government.  On October 26, 1864, Macdonald proposed to the Conference that Ottawa be the seat of government, \"subject to the royal prerogative\".  The motion passed unanimously.\nThere are some indications that behind the scenes, the issue was not yet firmly settled.  On his return from the London Conference, Macdonald stated publicly that \"he had some doubts before going to England as to whether the seat of government for the Dominion would remain in Ottawa, but he was now happy to say there was no question Ottawa was confirmed as the capital of the new Dominion.\"  The Governor General, Lord Monck, was privately grumbling over the choice of Ottawa.  In a confidential letter to the Colonial Secretary, he stated that the choice of Ottawa \"...seems like an act of insanity.\" He predicted that within four years the seat of government would move, likely to Quebec City.\nAlthough the monarch retains the power to move the seat of government under section 16, there has not been any such proposal since the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\n\n=== Provincial jurisdiction over Ottawa ===\n\nUnlike other federations, Canada does not have a specially designated capital area under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. Municipalities are under provincial jurisdiction, through section 92(8) of the Act. The city of Ottawa is in the province of Ontario and is incorporated under Ontario law.  The federal government also has a considerable presence in the office towers of the city of Gatineau, located across the Ottawa River, but Gatineau is in the province of Quebec and is  incorporated under Quebec law.  \nThere is no equivalent to the District of Columbia in the United States, nor the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. One Father of Confederation, John Hamilton Gray of New Brunswick, while praising the choice of Ottawa, stated that the lack of a federal district under the control of Parliament was a mistake.\nThe federal Parliament has passed a statute to create the National Capital Commission, but that federal legislation does not oust Ontario jurisdiction over Ottawa, nor Quebec jurisdiction over Gatineau. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the federal Parliament has some legislative jurisdiction over the area around the seat of government, but the extent of that power is not clear.\nThe mixture of federal, provincial and municipal jurisdiction over Ottawa and Gatineau became an issue during the Canada convoy protest in 2022.  The commissioner appointed to review the use of the Emergencies Act by the federal government commented on the overlapping jurisdiction, and stated that it may have contributed to the slow response to the protests.\n\n\n== Related provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867 ==\nSection 68 of the Act defines the seats of government of the four original provinces of Canada:  Toronto for Ontario;  Quebec City for Quebec;  Fredericton for New Brunswick; and Halifax for Nova Scotia.\nSection 92(8) of the Act provides that the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over municipalities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "''Shivbhuti'' was a Jain monk in the 1st century AD who is regarded as the monk who started the Digambara tradition as per the Śvetāmbara text Avashyak Bhashya written by Jinabhadra. Little is known about him apart from a single story that is written in the ancient Śvetāmbara text. The Jains, a book by Paul Dundas mentions him and the story.\n\n\n== Jinkalpi and Sthavirkalpi Monks ==\nAccording to Śvetāmbara scriptures, it is believed that there were two types of monks - Jinkalpi (who remained naked) and Sthavirkalpi (who draped garments around them). The Acharanga Sutra states the following three types of monks: -\n\nJinkalpi Achel - naked\nSthavirkalpi Eksataka - draped 1 cloth\nSthavirkalpi Santrottar - draped 2 or 3 clothes\nŚvetāmbara texts state that knowledge of the scriptures gradually dwindled and monks did not possess the necessary qualifications to become Jinkalpi. A monk needs to know 10 or more purvas to be jinkalpi. All other monks with lesser knowledge were Sthavirkalpi and draped clothes. Bhadrabahu and Sthulabhadra are both considered to be sthavirkalpi monks by Śvetāmbaras. Jinkalpi monks, are said to have differed from present-day Digambara monks. They did not live within the society and meditated in seclusion in forests and caves. Nudity in public places was condemned in Śvetāmbara texts such as the Acharanga Sutra.\n\n\n== Origin of Digambara Sect ==\nAccording to the Śvetāmbaras, it was not a creation of Sthulabhadra and that the Digambara sect was formed by a rebellious monk named Shivbhuti in 82 AD. The basis for this is the scripture Avashyak Bhashya composed by Acharya Jinbhadragani Kshamashraman in 3rd century AD and written down in 466 AD. Following is the story described in the mentioned scripture.\nThe story says that about 609 years after Mahavira attained nirvana, there was a city Rathavirapur near present-day Mathura. A layperson named Shivbhuti lived there and worked for King Sinharath. He had earned several accolades for his service to the king. As a result, he turned 'proud' and often stayed out of home late at nights. Once, his wife complained to his mother. To teach him a lesson, his mother asked him to leave and go somewhere else. Wandering, he entered Arya Krishnasuri's upashray (dwelling). After taking alochna (repentance) from Acharya Krishnasuri, he requested to become a monk. Shivbhuti was then initiated as a monk.\nOne day, while wandering as a monk, he arrived at Rathavirapur. On hearing about his arrival, the king gifted him a shawl (ratna-kambal). The shawl was a precious possession, but such a thing was totally against the Jain principle (vow) of Aparigraha. His preceptor, Acharya Krishnasuri tried to explain this to him, but to no avail. The acharya tore the shawl and this did not go well with Shivbhuti. He protested by stating that if the shawl was a possession then so were clothes. He adopted nudity immediately. Two monks Kaundinya and Kottavira joined him as disciples and this was the beginning of the Digambar sect. He preached that Moksha can be attained only through complete non-possession, including clothes.\nThe scripture also states that Shivbhuti's sister adopted nudity and joined him. However, the society thought of her as a prostitute, so Shivbhuti prevented nuns from staying nude. A condition was enforced that since women possess clothes, they are not fit to attain Moksha or liberation. This is in accordance with what current-day Digambaras believe regarding women attaining salvation.\n\n\n== Citations ==",

        "content": "Roberto Pane (21 November 1897 – 29 July 1987) was an Italian art historian, art critic, architect and painter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Taranto, at a young age Pane moved with his family to Naples. After taking part in World War I as a volunteer, and participating in the Gabriele D'Annunzio-led occupation of Rijeka, in 1922 he graduated in architecture at the Sapienza University of Rome. In the 1920s he served as professor at the Classical Lyceum Umberto I in Naples, and collaborated with the Superintendency of Antiquities of Campania on several projects. Starting from 1924, he took part in several editions of the Venice Biennale, held several solo exhibitions, and cured several projects in Naples, including the Molosiglio Gardens, the restoration of the Madonna della Pace Church, and the African-Christianity pavilion at the 1940 Mostra d'Oltremare. In 1930 he became professor of architecture at the University of Naples Federico II, a role he held until 1942.\nAfter debuting as an art critic in the journal Pan, Pane made his literary debut in 1936, with Architettura rurale campana (\"Rural Architecture in Campania\"), which was followed by Architettura del Rinascimento in Napoli (\"Renaissance Architecture in Naples\", 1937) and Architettura dell’età barocca in Napoli (\"Baroque Age Architecture in Naples\",1939). Characterized by noticeable Benedetto Croce's influences, his major work was Architettura e arti figurative (\"Architecture and figurative arts\", 1948).\nStarting from the 1950s, Pane was a vocal opponent of the speculative construction and championed the inalterability of historic centres. He collaborated on restoration and landscape plans of various cities, and in 1969 he founded a postgraduate school specializing in monument restoration. He collaborated with various institutions including UNESCO, and served as president of the interdisciplinary coordination committee for the reconstruction following the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. Active until his later years, Pane died on 29 July 1987, at the age of 89.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Emilio Lora-Tamayo D'Ocon (5 November 1950 – 29 March 2024) was a Spanish physicist and academic. He served as the president of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) twice, from 2003 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2017. He was a professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and served as rector for Menéndez Pelayo International University and the Universidad Camilo José Cela.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEmilio Lora-Tamayo was born on 5 November 1950, in Madrid. He was the son of Manuel Lora-Tamayo, who served during the Francoist dictatorship as the Minister of Education from 1962 to 1968 and president of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) from 1967 to 1971.\nLora-Tamayo received a degree in physical sciences in 1972 and his Diplôme d'Études Approfondies from Paul Sabatier University. He received his PhD in physical sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1977. He then conducted research at the École Supérieure de l'Aeronautique et de l'Espace and the Laboratoire de l'Informatique et de l'Electronique in France.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPrior to the completion of his doctorate, Lora-Tamayo worked at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), devoted in particular to microelectronics. Following the 2002 Prestige oil spill, he served as president of the Scientific Advisory Committee convened by the Spanish government. He held the post of Professor of Electronics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, beginning in 1989. He was vice president of Scientific and Technical Research at the CSIC between 1996 and 2003. In 2003 he was appointed president of the CSIC by the government of José María Aznar and served in that role until 2004. Between 2008 and 2012 he directed the CSIC's Barcelona Microelectronics Institute of the CSIC. He was appointed president of the CSIC again by the government of Mariano Rajoy in 2012, and held the position until 2017. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.\nStatements made by Lora-Tamayo in November 2014 describing the brain drain in Spain as an \"exaggerated urban legend\" caused unease in the Spanish scientific community due to the declining numbers of researchers in the CSIC and emigration to institutes abroad. Lora-Tamayo was also criticised for the abrupt dismissal of the director of the Estación Biológica de Doñana, Juan José Negro, ten months before the end of his mandate on 30 September 2015. Negro had been proposed by a majority of his fellow researchers. The environmental organisation WWF said it would not like the dismissal to have been \"a punishment for his clear and exemplary stance in the management of Doñana on issues such as the dredging of the Guadalquivir, the reopening of the Aznalcóllar mines or the claim for funds so that the Doñana Biological Station can continue\".\nLora-Tamayo was appointed rector of Menéndez Pelayo International University in November 2017. Less than a year later, the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, chaired by Pedro Duque, demanded his resignation. Initially, Lora-Tamayo declined but agreed to resign after the ministry presented a motion of censure in November 2018. According to Lora-Tamayo, the government asked him to resign in order to put a woman in the post, with the secretary of state, Ángeles Heras Caballero, arguing that this was the government's political line. He was succeeded in the post by María Luz Morán Calvo-Sotelo, daughter of Fernando Morán López.\nLora-Tamayo served as rector of the Universidad Camilo José Cela from 2020 to 2023.\nDuring his academic career, he published over 100 articles in scientific journals and presented more than 150 papers at national and international conferences. He also co-authored seven patents. He was also a member of the Real Academia San Dionisio of Jerez and of the Real Academia de Ciencias y Artes de Barcelona.\nLora-Tamayo died in Madrid on 29 March 2024, at the age of 73.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBibliography on Google Scholar",

        "content": "Section 8 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (French: article 8 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867) is a provision of the Constitution of Canada requiring a census every ten years.\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is the constitutional statute which established Canada.  Originally named the British North America Act, 1867, the Act continues to be the foundational statute for the Constitution of Canada, although it has been amended many times since 1867.  It is now recognised as part of the supreme law of Canada.\n\n\n== Constitution Act, 1867 ==\n\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 is part of the Constitution of Canada and thus part of the supreme law of Canada. The Act sets out the constitutional framework of Canada, including the structure of the  federal government and the powers of the federal government and the provinces. It was the product of extensive negotiations between the provinces of British North America at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, the Quebec Conference in 1864, and the London Conference in 1866. Those conferences were followed by consultations with the British government in 1867.  The Act was then enacted in 1867 by the British Parliament under the name the British North America Act, 1867. In 1982 the Act was brought under full Canadian control through the Patriation of the Constitution, and was renamed the Constitution Act, 1867.  Since Patriation the Act can only be amended in Canada, under the amending formula set out in the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\n\n== Text of section 8 ==\nSection 8 reads:\n\nDecennial Census8 In the general Census of the Population of Canada which is hereby required to be taken in the Year One thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and in every Tenth Year, thereafter, the respective Populations of the Four Provinces shall be distinguished.\nSection 8 is found in Part II of the Constitution Act, 1867, dealing with the union of the provinces.\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nSection 8 is based in part on the provisions of the Quebec Resolutions relating to the census.  The requirement for a census every ten years is closely tied to the redistribution of seats in the House of Commons.  The Quebec Resolutions provided that there should be a census every ten years, starting in 1871, that no redistribution of seats could occur until after the 1871 census, and that there should be a redistribution of seats after every decennial census.  The London Resolutions were to similar effect.  The census requirement for the purposes of redistribution was in the first rough draft of the bill, varied in the initial draft, and took final form in the version introduced in the British Parliament.\nSection 8 has not been amended since the Act was enacted in 1867.\n\n\n== Purpose and interpretation ==\n\nAt Confederation, the population imbalance between Canada East (now Quebec) and Canada West (now Ontario) was one of the major political issues which contributed to the push for Confederation.  Canada East and Canada West had equal representation in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, but Canada West had substantially more people.  George Brown, one of the leading Reformers in Canada West, campaigned for several years on \"rep by pop\", namely that the representation of each section in Parliament should be directly tied to each section's population.  That principle was recognised in the Quebec Resolutions, crafted by the Fathers of Confederation at the Quebec Conference in 1864.  They agreed that representation in the lower house of the new Parliament would be based on each province's share in the national population.\nSection 8 of the Act implemented this principle by requiring a national census every ten years, with the total population broken down by province. That way, the seats in the House of Commons could be allocated to each province based on the province's share of the national population.\n\n\n== Related provisions ==\nSection 51 of the Act requires that there be a redistribution of seats in the House of Commons every ten years, after the decennial census.\nSection 52 of the Act provides that the House of Commons can be increased in size, provided the increase does not affect the proportionate representation of the provinces.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Roman amphitheatre of Albano Laziale is a Roman amphitheatre located in Albano Laziale, Lazio.\nThe amphitheatre was built for the nearby Castra Albana, the fortress of the Legio II Parthica founded by the emperor Septimius Severus (193-211); however, the amphitheatre was built later than the fortress around the middle of the 3rd century. Its capacity was at least 15,000 and its maximum length 113 m.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== The superstructure terrace ===\nThe amphitheatre stands on a slope: to reinforce the platform on which it was built, a terrace had to be constructed, 6.75 m high and 59.6 m long, running parallel to the amphitheatre's perimeter to the west at an average distance of 23 m. The terrace wall, adorned with fourteen niches positioned 2.1 m above the ground, is built with irregular layers of peperino ashlars and bricks.\n\n\n=== The \"vomitoria\" ===\nThe two main entrances (Vomitoria) were, unusually, not aligned with the major axis of the arena because of the rugged terrain.\n\n\n==== Western \"Vomitorium\" ====\nThis vomitorium, shifted slightly from the major axis of the arena, was largely carved into the solid rock of peperino, to a height of about 2.5 m. The rest was constructed with opus quadratum in the same volcanic stone. Only the first section of the vomitorium, approximately 6.5 m wide, was covered by a barrel vault for a length of 11.5 m. In the second section, two staircases, each 1.7 m wide, provided access to the seating. The entrance is partly closed by a partition, probably added later, and partly open but originally closed by a gate, the hinges of which are still visible. In the floor of the vomitorium, there is a rectangular pit containing a low medieval Christian burial, dating to the period when the amphitheatre was partially converted into a Christian oratory.\n\n\n==== Eastern \"Vomitorium\" ====\nThis vomitorium also has an unusual rectangular shape, allowing the entrance to align with the major axis of the arena. Archaeologist Giuseppe Lugli praised the architect's skill in solving this issue. The first section, aligned with the major axis of the arena, is 6.35 m long and 4.7 m wide, while the second section, perpendicular to the major axis of the arena and forming a right angle with the first, is 30 m long and exits outside the amphitheatre. Like the western vomitorium, part of the structure is carved into the peperino rock, while part is constructed with opus quadratum in the same stone.\n\n\n=== The Arena ===\nThe major axis of the ellipse formed by the arena measured 67.5 m, while the minor axis measured 45 m, resulting in a total area of around 2500 m2. The first excavation campaign of 1912-1914 uncovered the entire southern hemisphere of the arena, which was founded on the solid rock of peperino. Around the entire ellipse, there is a drainage channel, approximately 0.35 m wide, which discharged water into a channel originally covered by removable wooden boards, 1.2 m wide and 3 m deep. This larger channel then emptied into an underground chamber near the pulvinar. During the second excavation campaign of 1919-1920, it was discovered that the water flowed into another channel beyond the superstructure terrace. However, traces of this latter channel were lost beyond the boundary of the property of the episcopal seminary. The aforementioned 3-meter-deep channel had a dual purpose: to drain water and to provide access for those arranging the stage equipment, who would then emerge in the center of the arena. The arena's enclosing wall has been preserved to a maximum height of 2.5 m. However, it is likely, based on some discovered blocks, that it originally extended higher with a curved overhang.\n\n\n=== The \"Cavea\" ===\nThe cavea and seating have largely been lost due to the stripping of the monument following the Roman era. However, it is believed that the seating was divided into two sections, the maenianum primum and the maenianum secundum, each further divided into lower and upper sectors. From the remains of stairs found in the superstructure arches, it is hypothesized that one stairway every three arches provided access between the lower and upper levels.\nRegarding the number of seating rows, Leon Battista Alberti calculated 30, a number still considered plausible today. Archaeologist Giuseppe Lugli also estimated that the amphitheatre could accommodate a maximum of about 16,000 spectators (14,850 seated), assuming each seat was 0.44 meters wide, as in the Colosseum in Rome, and considering that the cavea rises about 30 m with a base of 23.5 m and an incline of 27 degrees.\n\n\n=== The \"Pulvinar\" ===\nThe pulvinar was the imperial box, equivalent to the \"authorities' tribune\" in our larger stadiums. It was originally located at the center of the seating semi-circle, on the southern side. Access was initially through fornix XIII of the first order, measuring 23 m long and 3 m wide, via two double-ramped staircases that led to either side of the platform. However, this access was later abandoned in favor of the nearby fornix XIV, probably due to the closure of the two staircases, allowing the pulvinar's surface area to triple. The entrance to this fornix is marked by two semi-columns in brick with Attic bases in peperino. The width is also less than the previous fornix (from a maximum of 2.4 m to a minimum of 1.97 m).\n\n\n=== The Arches ===\nDue to the particularly challenging terrain, the builders chose to support the seating with a series of arches. Archaeologist Giuseppe Lugli commented on these structures:\n\"At first sight, the great irregularity that exists among them in shape and size is striking, not explained by particular conditions of the terrain. We cannot account for this except by rethinking the hasty construction and the lack of an elaborate and precise design.\"\nThe maximum length of the interior rooms within the arches, arranged on two levels, ranges from 22 to 23 m, while the width varies between 2 and 4.5 m. Additionally, each arch has a different roof, floor level, and foundation offset, leading Lugli to describe these constructions as \"peculiar.\"\nEach of the rooms in the arches had its own function: for example, fornices VI and VII were likely where animals were kept for performances; fornix IX was a storage room, fornix XVI a storeroom, fornices V, VIII, XII, XVII, and XX served as stairwells to the second level, fornices XIII and XIV as access to the pulvinar. In some fornices (VII and VIII), there are medieval Christian burials, while in others, it was not possible to clear the fill material due to the precariousness of the walls.\nAround the circumference of the amphitheatre, at least on the southern side, there was a paved road, which probably then reached the Appian Way, following the current Via dell'Anfiteatro Romano to Piazza Giuseppe Mazzini. A second road likely led to Domitian's Villa at Castel Gandolfo, following the current \"galleria di sopra,\" based on Roman cobblestones found in 1917 and 1921 near the church of Santa Maria Assunta and the adjacent Collegio di Propaganda Fide at Castel Gandolfo, in the extraterritorial area of the Pontifical Villa of Castel Gandolfo.\n\n\n== References ==",

It focuses on blended wing body aircraft.\nThe U.S. Air Force, NASA, and a small group of private investors supplied the initial funding. \nTom O’Leary is a co-founder and the CEO.  Mark Page is a co-founder and the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2023, JetZero announced its Z5 project, designed to carry 250 passengers, targeting the New Midmarket Airplane category, expecting to use existing CFM International LEAP or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G 35,000 lbf (160 kN) engines. In August 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235-million contract awarded over a four-year period to JetZero, culminating in first flight of the full-scale demonstrator by the first quarter of 2027. The goal of the contract is to demonstrate the capabilities of BWB technology, giving the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options for their future air platforms.\nIn January 2024 the company began moving into a 275,000 sq ft space at Long Beach Airport formerly occupied by Gulfstream.\nIn March 2024 its Pathfinder 1:8 scale  demonstrator received its airworthiness certificate from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), clearing the aircraft  for test flights at Edwards Air Force Base in California.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has an elevation 758 metres (2,487 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe mountain was historically part of Liechtenstein, in the municipality of Balzers. In the 1930s, Swiss military planners became concerned that the territory made fortifications in Fläsch vulnerable. This concern was heightened by perceptions that Liechtenstein was susceptible to annexation into Nazi Germany in the wake of the Anschluss of Austria.\nIn 1938, the Swiss Federal Council began negotiations with Liechtenstein to cede the Ellhorn mountain to them. Though Josef Hoop, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, was supportive of the transfer, he argued that the country should be fairly compensated for the loss of territory, with either a transfer of Swiss land elsewhere or greater banking cooperation between the two countries. The transfer faced resistance from the residents in Balzers, and was not supported by Franz Joseph II, the ruling Prince of Liechtenstein. In addition to unofficial objections from Nazi Germany, the lack of support forced Hoop to end negotiations with Switzerland.\nFollowing World War II, Switzerland once again pressed Liechtenstein for the transfer of Ellhorn. Switzerland threatened to, among other things, end the customs union between the two countries which had existed since 1924. Despite the community in Balzers again objecting in November 1948, the transfer was approved by the Landtag of Liechtenstein the following month and finalised in 1949. In exchange for the transfer, Switzerland agreed to forgive much of Liechtenstein's debt incurred during World War II. In 1952, Switzerland expanded its fortifications in the area to include the Ellhorn mountain.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vethathiri Maharishi (14 August 1911 – 28 March 2006) is an Indian yoga guru, philosopher and Hindu spiritual leader. He founded the World Community Service Centre (WCSC) in Chennai and established the Temple of Consciousness (Arivu Thirukkoil) at Aliyar near Coimbatore. He promoted the practice of yoga and meditation as a means of achieving spiritual awareness and thereby the development of mankind for the furtherance of human brotherhood and world peace. He evolved a simplified Kundalini Yoga combining yoga with meditation, simple exercises, and traditional medicinal practices which enabled him to teach it to the common people.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nVethathiri was born into a Tamil family on August 14, 1911, in Guduvancheri near Madras in the Madras Presidency (now part of Chengalpattu district of Tamil Nadu). He was the eighth child of his parents Varadappan and Chinnammal, who were weavers. In 1916, he was enrolled for schooling at the age of five but had to drop out of school due to the poor economic situation of the family and extreme poverty.\nAt the age of 12, he met A. Balakrishna, who introduced Vethathiri to spirituality, Advaita philosophy and devotion to God. He moved to Madras after accepting a job at a private company. There he met S. Krishna Rao, who trained him in traditional Siddha and Ayurveda medicine. Vethathri passed the Ayurvedacharya examination conducted by the Government Medical Council to qualify as a physician and served as an aide during the Second World War. He met seer Paranjyothi, who initiated him into Kundalini Yoga and taught him Hindu philosophy and meditation techniques.\nAt the age of 23, he married Logambal. He engaged in multiple businesses till his late 30s and worked as a clerk with the postal department before embarking on a spiritual life.\n\n\n== Spiritual life and yoga ==\nWhile he was involved in analyzing scriptures and trying to ascertain the meaning of self-realization over the years, he was inspired by Ramalinga Swamigal, after which he was completely engrossed in spirituality. Vethathri spent time investigating civil wrongs in social life and motivated him towards a moral life with charity to share one's possessions equitably with others. He preached attaining a state of knowledge through self-realization and to live in peace.\nVethathri practiced Kundalini Yoga and evolved a Simplified Kundalini Yoga (SKY) from the same combining it with kayakalpa and simple exercises in order to teach them to the common people. In 1958, he founded the World Community Service Centre (WCSC) in Chennai. WCSC was established as a non-profit, non-religious and philanthropic organization and has an ECOSOC consultative status with the United Nations. It is involved in running meditation centers internationally and in teaching his practices. In 1984, he established Arivu Thirukkol (Temple of Consciousness) at Aliyar in Coimbatore district which became the center of his teaching and practices during the later part of his life.\n\n\n== Teachings ==\n\nAs per Vethathri, “Individual Peace leads to World Peace” and he emphasized that world peace is only possible when every individual is living peacefully in co-existence. He believed that peace percolates to his/her immediate family and society and eventually to the whole world. He gave 14 practical points to achieve the same, collectively termed as Vethathiriam. He integrated scientific practices with spirituality and medicine. Because of his preaching of simplified teachings, he was addressed as Thathuva Gnani (loosely translated as \"the Common Man’s Philosopher\").\nHe believed that the fundamental cause of human misery was the lack of self-awareness and awareness about the relationship with others. He emphasized proper education as it is the basis for physical and mental maturity. As per Vethathri, introspection leads to self-awareness, and the practices of yoga help in developing the necessary strength and character to achieve the same. The Universe is made up of space which evolves consistently with various objects in it made up of smaller particles. According to him, time, matter, and energy are manifestations of space and gravity itself is a manifestation of compression of particles in space.\n\n\n== Death ==\nVethathri Maharishi passed away on 28 March 2006 after a brief illness followed by a heart attack.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVethathri has written more than 75 books mostly in Tamil language and later translated into others. Most of the books are on the subjects of world peace, virtues to be followed in life and practice of Yoga and meditation. He ran a monthly journal titled Arivoli for more than 35 years.

The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\", and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".\nThe Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work was started as an annual category by the World Science Fiction Society in 2024. Prior to then, when the category was first successfully proposed in 2021, an example one-off version of the category was awarded as Best Video Game, under rules which allow individual one-off categories to be awarded in any given year. An earlier attempt at a one-off game category, entitled Best Interactive Video Game, had been made in 2006 but did not receive enough nominations to form a final ballot.\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The final selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year. Initial nominations are made by members from January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly from April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Worldcons are generally held in August or early September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.\nUnder the Best Video Game title, six video games were nominated, all by different developers, with Hades by Supergiant Games winning. In its formal inaugural year, a further six video games by five additional studios were nominated.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\n  *   Winners and joint winners\n\n\n== See also ==\nNebula Award for Best Game Writing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHugo Award official site",

        "content": "The Night of the Tanks, also known as the Tanquetazo, was a military episode that occurred in Venezuela on 26 October 1988, during the government of Jaime Lusinchi, while he was out of the country and shortly before the general elections in the country, when a column of 26 Dragon armored vehicles (V-100) were mobilized from Fort Tiuna to the area of the Miraflores Presidential Palace in downtown Caracas, for no apparent reason.\nThe army major who ordered the mobilization, Soler Zambrano, argued that he was following orders from superiors in order to protect the security of the acting president, Simón Alberto Consalvi, but later intelligence reports indicated that the mobilization consisted of a thwarted coup d'état.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn 26 October 1988, when President Jaime Lusinchi was abroad on an official visit to Uruguay, and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Simón Alberto Consalvi, was in charge of the presidency, Army Major José Domingo Soler Zambrano mobilized a column of 26 Dragon armored vehicles (V-100) from the Ayala Battalion at 7:00 p.m., Fort Tiuna to the area of the Miraflores Presidential Palace in downtown Caracas, to the Carmelitas corner on Urdaneta Avenue, for no apparent reason.The tanks took strategic positions around the headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs under the command of Captain Echeverría, and another column took the presidential residence of La Viñeta. Consalvi, who was surprised by the mobilization, was working at the headquarters of the ministry. Captain Echeverría informed him that the presence of the tanks there was to \"provide protection to the acting president\". Consalvi immediately communicated with the Minister of Defense, General Italo del Valle Alliegro, who, equally surprised, ordered the withdrawal of the tanks which had taken both the Ministry of the Interior and the presidential residence of La Viñeta, as well as the preventive arrest of Major Soler and the captains who commanded the tank columns.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nHaving carried out the mobilization, Major Soler Zambrano had violated all the protocols and procedures established for the realization of any military operation, which requires a series of confirmations by encrypted radiograms, direct and written orders and other security measures. Soler was immediately subjected to military trial and interrogated for several days about the motives for ordering the mobilization of the tanks, answering that he was obeying orders given by telephone by the inspector general and second army commander, Major General Juan José Bastardo Velásquez, who denied being the author of the order.A few days after the events, the Amparo massacre took place, which occupied the national attention, and later the Minister of Defense ordered to close the file of the Night of the Tanks, so no further proceedings, statements or new arrests were made in connection with the events. Candidate Carlos Andrés Pérez assumed the presidency in 1989, and shortly after the beginning of his term he faced the Caracazo, so no more attention was paid to the events. The episode was met with indifference, no further investigations were carried out and no disciplinary measures were taken in the army in response.[1][2][3] Later on, the conspirators of the 1992 coup attempts were implicated in the Night of the Tanks, including Hugo Chávez.\n\n\n== Motives ==\nAccording to Major Soler, the mobilization of the tanks occurred in response to the supposed information of a plot against Consalvi's life. Later intelligence reports indicated that the mobilization consisted of a frustrated coup d'état. According to General Herminio Fuenmayor, the Night of the Tanks was a failed attempt by some officers to secure promotions quickly. According to him, the conspirators would have used an army major to mobilize the tanks, be able to argue violations to security protocols and then bet on the elimination of two entire military promotions; the mass dismissal would have been similar to what happened in the Soviet Union, after Mathias Rust landed his light aircraft in Moscow's Red Square. By getting rid of two promotions of generals, the plotters would occupy command positions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPresidency of Jaime Lusinchi\nFebruary 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt\nNovember 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Countess Aleksandra Grigorevna Laval (née Kozitskaya; March 18, 1772 – November 17, 1850) was one of the heirs of Myasnikov's millions, a salon owner, art collector and philanthropist. Wife of Count Ivan Laval, mother of Ekaterina Trubetskaya, mother–in–law of the Decembrist Prince Trubetskoy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe eldest daughter of Ekaterina II's Secretary of State Grigoriy Kozitskiy from his marriage to Ekaterina Myasnikova, the daughter of a famous rich man. She grew up in luxury, in a family that boasted of its wealth. At the age of 26, after the wedding of her younger sister Anna with Prince Aleksandr Beloselskiy, she fell in love with the French emigrant Ivan Laval, an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The mother, Ekaterina Ivanovna, although she was herself the poorly educated daughter of an Old Ritualist ferryman on the Volga, according to family legend, opposed such an unequal marriage.\nThen Aleksandra, in love, wrote a most submissive request and put it in a special box placed near the emperor's palace. Pavel I wanted to understand the petition and demanded clarification from Ekaterina Ivanovna. She stated that the reason for the refusal was that Laval \"is not of our faith, he came from nowhere and has a small rank\". The emperor's resolution was brief:\n\nHe is a Christian, I know him, and for Kozitskaya the rank is quite sufficient. Get married in half an hour.\nIvan Laval and Aleksandra Kozitskaya were immediately married in the parish church without any preparation. Aleksandra Grigorevna brought her husband a huge dowry, about 20 million, including the Voskresenskiy Plant in Ural. Skillfully using the resulting wealth, in 1814 Ivan Laval was elevated with his descendants to the Dignity of Count of the Kingdom of France, which was recognized for him in the Russian Empire in 1817. The title and successful career finally reconciled Ekaterina Ivanovna with her daughter's choice; in 1833, before her death, she generously gifted the Laval Couple.\nWhile traveling abroad, Aleksandra Grigorevna met many prominent people, including French writers François Chateaubriand and Benjamin Constant, and visited the salon of the writer de Staël, with whom she was considered a friend. According to Baron Modest Korf, Countess Laval introduced and brooded in her family an extraordinary disorder; she herself was:\n\nSmall, pockmarked, disgusting, like a Chinese doll and always with bare shoulders and colossal breasts, looking at which you just wanted to spit. To this end, in character, tone and manner, she was the perfect man. Her husband was in no way inferior to her in disgustingness, but in completely different dimensions, this is a kind of skeleton of a small heron with eyes like buns, but seeing nothing, with legs that can, it seems, knock down any breath of wind, and, moreover, with similar character.\nAleksandra Laval died on November 17, 1850. She was buried in the necropolis of the Holy Trinity Aleksandr Nevskiy Lavra.\n\n\n== Literary and musical salon ==\nAleksandra Laval was the owner of a brilliant literary and musical salon.\nIn the early 1800s, by order of the new owner, the architect Thomas de Thomon rebuilt the mansion on the English Embankment, near the Senat. He decorated the main facade, facing the embankment, with ten Ionic three–quarter columns at the level of the second and third floors. Currently, the mansion is part of the complex of buildings of the Constitutional Court.\nAleksandra Grigorevna enjoyed great respect in high society. It was believed that she inherited from her mother her natural intelligence, common sense, strong character combined with tact, combining all this with an excellent upbringing. Soon her house became one of the cultural centers of Sankt–Peterburg in the first half of the 19th century. Poets, writers, and simply connoisseurs of art gathered at her place, new works were read, and novelties in European literature were discussed.\nAccording to the Lavals' Librarian Charles Saint–Julien, the salon \"brought together the most outstanding representatives of poetry and literature; here between 1827 and 1830 I had the opportunity to see Pushkin, Krylov and Zhukovskiy...\". Among Aleksandra Laval's guests were Aleksandr Turgenev, Pyotr Vyazemskiy, Nikolay Gnedich, Aleksey Olenin, Aleksey Pleshcheev, Ivan Kozlov and many others. Sometimes up to 600 people gathered in the Laval's Salon, sometimes Emperor Aleksandr I was there too.\nOn March 10, 1816, Nikolay Karamzin read unpublished chapters of the \"History of the Russian State\" here, hoping that an influential high–society salon would provide sufficient support from people close to the court, which would help in obtaining permission to publish the book. Aleksandr Pushkin also read his unpublished works in the house on the English Embankment. Here, in 1819, he first read the ode \"Liberty\", and on May 16, 1828, in the presence of Aleksandr Griboedov and Adam Mitskevich, the tragedy \"Boris Godunov\". Mikhail Lermontov also attended Laval's Receptions, and here on February 16, 1840, he had a quarrel with the son of the French ambassador, Barant, which ended in a duel.\nIn the 1840s, at evenings in the presence of almost the entire high society of Sankt–Peterburg, Rubini, Caradori, Viardot–García, and Tamburini sang.\nSimilar receptions took place not only on the English Embankment, but also at the Lavals' Dacha on Aptekarskiy Island, at the confluence of the Malaya Nevka and the Karpovka River. The plot was given to the couple by Emperor Pavel I as a wedding gift. Prince Pyotr Vyazemskiy called conversations at dacha receptions \"the living newspaper of Peterburg\", and in the draft of Pushkin's Story \"Guests Arrived at the Dacha\" (1828), one of the scenes took place at Lavals' Dacha.\nIn 1825, after the Decembrist Uprising, the mansion on the English Embankment was subjected to a thorough search, since Lavals' eldest daughter Ekaterina was married to Colonel Sergey Trubetskoy, one of the leaders of the Northern Society. However, this did not reduce the popularity of Aleksandra Grigorevna's salon.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nAleksandra Grigorevna took part in the publication of the newspaper \"The Ferret\" (French: Le Furet), which was published from June 30, 1829, by her husband's librarian secretary, the French writer Charles de Saint–Julien. The newspaper was published in French and was intended for an aristocratic audience; it contained news of modern French and later Russian literature, reviews of performances by French and Italian troupes, reviews of the works of Russian writers and poets, including reviews of the works of Pushkin.\n\n\n== Charity ==\nAleksandra Grigorevna was also actively involved in charity work. On June 4, 1838, on the Peterburg Side, she established an orphanage, the third in Sankt–Peterburg, for visiting children of both sexes. By the highest order of Empress Aleksandra Fyodorovna (wife of Nikolay I), the shelter was named Lavalskiy. At first the shelter was located in a rented house, but since 1840 the shelter was transferred to a house specially purchased with funds from Aleksandra Grigorevna. And until the death of its benefactress, the shelter was maintained at her expense. After 1850, the shelter was maintained at the expense of her daughters, grandchildren, voluntary donations and wills. The shelter existed until 1918.\nAt the expense of Aleksandra Grigorevna, the church of the unmercenary saints Cosmas and Damian was built in the village of Bolshoy Vyas (now Luninskiy District of the Penza Oblast) and the church in honor of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God in the village of Urusovo (now Rtishchevskiy District of the Saratov Oblast).\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThrough the efforts of the countess, a unique art collection of paintings and ancient sculptures, collected during her trips to Europe, especially in Italy, appeared in the house on the English Embankment. On the walls of her house there were canvases that the hostess passed off as works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Ruisdael, Lorrain, Albani, Bartolomeo and other artists. In the halls there were up to 300 ancient Greek and Italian vases, including \"Dionysus Fighting a Giant\", \"Farewell of a Warrior to His Family\", \"Feast Scene\", clay and glass items and about 300 antique bronze objects. Roman copies of the 1st–2nd centuries CE from Greek originals of the 5th–4th centuries BCE were of great interest; Proto–Corinthian aryballes occupied a special place, among them even a rare example from the 8th century BCE. There were about 30 pieces of art from Egypt dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE, including: \"The Sacred Falcon\", \"The King's Head\", \"The Kneeling Priest\".\nThe marble floor in the house was taken from the palace of the Roman Emperor Tiberius on the island of Capri.\nThere was a rich library of five thousand volumes with bookplates by the engraver Nikolay Utkin with books on history, philosophy, economics, art, and geography.\nMany exhibits from the Lavals' Collection were shown at various exhibitions. After the death of Aleksandra Grigorevna, the collection of paintings and the library were divided between her heirs, and the most valuable part of the collection of ancient Egyptian and ancient works was transferred to the Ermitazh, where it is still stored.\n\n\tGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Family ==\nFrom her marriage to Ivan Laval, Aleksandra Laval had two sons and four daughters:\n\nEkaterina Ivanovna (1800–1854), was married to the Decembrist Prince Sergey Trubetskoy, and was the first to follow her exiled husband to Sibir;\nZinaida Ivanovna (1801–1873), from 1823 she was married to Major General and diplomat Ludwig Lebzeltern (1774–1854);\nVladimir Ivanovich (February 2, 1804 – April 21, 1825), cornet of the Horse Guards, shot himself, according to one version, after losing at cards, according to another, as a result of an accident;\nPavel Ivanovich (1806 – April 1, 1812), died of fever, was buried in the Aleksandr Nevskiy Lavra;\nSofiya Ivanovna (1809–1871), maid of honor, was married from 1833 to Count Aleksandr Borkh (1804–1867), diplomat and chamberlain. Sofiya Ivanovna was involved in charity work, and since 1834 she was a member of the council of the Patriotic Ladies' Society. Ivan Kozlov's poem \"The Broken Ship\" (1832) is dedicated to her. After the death of her mother, she inherited a mansion on the English Embankment;\nAleksandra Ivanovna (October 8, 1811 – 1886), baptized on October 22, 1811, in Isaac's Cathedral under the reception of her grandmother Ekaterina Kozitskaya; was married (from August 23, 1829) to Count Stanislav Korwin–Kossakowski (1795–1872), writer, artist, master of ceremonies, and envoy to the Madrid Court.\n\n\tDaughters\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Image in cinema ==\n\"The Star of Captivating Happiness\" – actress Tatyana Okunevskaya.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nVaynshteyn A.

He was redistricted back to the 21st district in 2006.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nBlais first ran for Rhode Island Senate's 21st district in 1990, being defeated by Democratic incumbent Raymond J. Monahan by 89 votes in the general election. Blais ran again in 1992 and won with 4,836 votes (54.14%), defeating Monahan who only attained 3,570 votes (39.96%). Blais ran for re-election and won in 1994, defeating Democratic candidate Gwendolyn M. Westerman and Independent candidate Ernest J. Perras Jr., winning 5,306 votes (66.15%) to Westerman's 2,392 votes (29.82%) and Perras's 322 votes (4.01%).\nIn 1996 and 1998, Blais ran unopposed in the general election. It was not until 2000 that Blais saw competitors again, Democratic candidate Michael G. Reeves and Reform candidate Victor G. Moffitt challenged Blais, who defeated both candidates with 4,223 votes (43.68%) to Reeves's 3,652 votes (37.78%) and Moffitt's 1,791 votes (18.52%).\nBlais was redistricted to the 24th Senate district in 2002 following the downsizing of the Rhode Island General Assembly in accordance with the 1984 Rhode Island Constitution. Blais defeated Salvatore Lombardi in the general election, with 6,646 votes (63.95%) to Lombardi's 3,746 votes (36.04%). Blais again defeated Lombardi in the 2004 Senate election.\nBlais was redistricted back to the 21st Senate district in 2006, and defeated Lombardi in the general election for a third time in a row in the general election. In 2008, Blais defeated Lombardi for a fourth time, winning 7,657 votes (53.9%) to Lombardi's 6,554 votes (46.1%).\nBlais's career in the Rhode Island Senate came to an end in 2010, as he was defeated by just 23 votes in the Republican Party's primary by Nicholas Kettle, who would go on to win the general election.\n\n\n=== Political positions ===\nAs a pharmacist and the owner of his own pharmacy, Blais often advocated for small businesses and pharmaceuticals. Blais was a major factor in passing the legislation which created the Rhode Island Organ Donor Registry. Blais was also the first member of the General Assembly to propose legislation which would decriminalize possession of marijuana in the state.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBlais is married to Beverly A. Webster, and has two children. He attended the University of Rhode Island and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in pharmacy.\n\n\n=== Revocation of pharmaceutical license ===\nBlais had his pharmaceutical license suspended for 2 years by the Rhode Island Department of Health Board of Pharmacy in 2012 after he mistakenly dispensed prescriptions of Omeprazole tainted with Morphine to two children, however in 2013, Director of Health Michael Fine permanently revoked Blais's license.\nBlais sued the Department of Health in 2014, and his license was reinstated in 2014 by Judge Stephen P. Nugent, who ruled that the Department of Health did not have the authority to revoke Blais's license. Blais further sued the state for damages, seeking $500,000 and an additional $63,000 in legal fees. He was awarded $43,000 in legal fees by Judge Daniel Procaccini in 2016. However, in May 2017, Judge Procaccini ruled that the Department of Health was within their right to revoke Blais's license, and did not award any damages.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"The Indigo Streak\" is a song by American rock band Greta Van Fleet. It is the sixth track from their third album, Starcatcher.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song was written while the band was working on their third album, and was then recorded during the Starcatcher sessions in 2022. They debuted the song on March 29, 2023, during their \"Dreams in Gold Tour\", and the track was released to the public on July 20, 2023, on digital media, one day before the release of the full album.\n\n\n== Composition and themes ==\nSquare One Magazine reviewed the song saying; \"The Indigo Streak is a stripped back, simpler than usual track for Greta Van Fleet, and plows forward with a simple purpose, employing an excellent riff and pounding drums along with a wailing of “Into the Ether” in the chorus to drive the song into listeners minds and get them nodding or thrashing along.\"\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe song was released one day before the release of Starcatcher as a visualizer on YouTube, however, the song was fully released to music streaming platforms on July 21, 2023. The song was met with praise for the songs drive and melodic approach, drawing similarities to a more psychedelic rock feel.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGreta Van Fleet\n\nJoshua Kiszka – vocals, background vocals\nJacob Kiszka – guitar, backing vocals\nSamuel Kiszka – bass guitar, keyboards, background vocals\nDaniel Wagner – drums, background vocals\nTechnical\n\nDave Cobb – production\nGreg Gordon – engineering\nPhillip Smith – additional engineering\nSpike Stent – mixing engineer\nMatt Wolach – mixing\nPete Lyman – mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Situated in the heart of the Old Port, it runs for around 233 feet (71 m), from Fore Street in the northwest to Commercial Street in the southeast. One-way from Fore Street, its surface is cobblestoned, with brick sidewalks. The street is named for William H.

The Mariner's Church, built in 1828 in the Greek Revival style, stands at the northern corner of Fore and Moulton. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. C. H. Robinson, a paper company owned by Charles Henry Robinson (1839–after 1926), formerly occupied the entire block, including 9 Moulton Street, which became the home of Mexicali Blues for 28 years. Old Port Tavern occupied part of the Mariner's Church building between 1973 and 2022.\nAt the head of Moulton Street, 375 Fore Street was the home of Bull Feeney's, which closed in 2023 after 21 years in business.\nLong Wharf, the home of DiMillo's Floating Restaurant, stands across Commercial Street from Moulton Street. Wharf Street, meanwhile, runs southwest from Moulton Street to Union Street, crossing Dana Street en route.\nMoulton Street has been noted for its boutique stores.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The history of radiation protection begins at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with the realization that ionizing radiation from natural and artificial sources can have harmful effects on living organisms. As a result, the study of radiation damage also became a part of this history.\nWhile radioactive materials and X-rays were once handled carelessly, increasing awareness of the dangers of radiation in the 20th century led to the implementation of various preventive measures worldwide, resulting in the establishment of radiation protection regulations. Although radiologists were the first victims, they also played a crucial role in advancing radiological progress and their sacrifices will always be remembered. Radiation damage caused many people to suffer amputations or die of cancer. The use of radioactive substances in everyday life was once fashionable, but over time, the health effects became known. Investigations into the causes of these effects have led to increased awareness of protective measures. The dropping of atomic bombs during World War II brought about a drastic change in attitudes towards radiation. The effects of natural cosmic radiation, radioactive substances such as radon and radium found in the environment, and the potential health hazards of non-ionizing radiation are well-recognized. Protective measures have been developed and implemented worldwide, monitoring devices have been created, and radiation protection laws and regulations have been enacted.\nIn the 21st century, regulations are becoming even stricter. The permissible limits for ionizing radiation intensity are consistently being revised downward. The concept of radiation protection now includes regulations for the handling of non-ionizing radiation.\n\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany, radiation protection regulations are developed and issued by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV). The Federal Office for Radiation Protection is involved in the technical work. In Switzerland, the Radiation Protection Division of the Federal Office of Public Health is responsible, and in Austria, the Ministry of Climate Action and Energy. \n\n\n== X-rays ==\n\n\n=== Early radiation consequences ===\nThe discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845-1923) in 1895 led to extensive experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. The first X-ray machines produced extremely unfavorable radiation spectra for imaging with extremely high skin doses. In February 1896, John Daniel and William Lofland Dudley (1859–1914) of Vanderbilt University conducted an experiment in which Dudley's head was X-rayed, resulting in hair loss. Herbert D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia University, suffered severe burns on his hands and chest during demonstration experiments with X-rays. Burns and hair loss were reported in scientific journals. Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was one of the first researchers to explicitly warn of the potential dangers of X-rays in the Electrical Review on May 5, 1897 - after initially claiming them to be completely harmless. He suffered massive radiation damage after his experiments. Nevertheless, some doctors at the time still claimed that X-rays had no effect on humans. Until the 1940s, X-ray machines were operated without any protective safeguards.\nRöntgen himself was spared the fate of the other X-ray users by habit. He always carried the unexposed photographic plates in his pockets and found that they were exposed if he remained in the same room during the exposure. So he regularly left the room when he took X-rays.\n\nThe use of X-rays for diagnostic purposes in dentistry was made possible by the pioneering work of C. Edmund Kells (1856-1928), a New Orleans dentist who demonstrated them to dentists in Asheville, North Carolina, in July 1896. Kells committed suicide after suffering from radiation-induced cancer for many years. He had been amputated one finger at a time, later his entire hand, followed by his forearm and then his entire arm.\nOtto Walkhoff (1860-1934), one of the most important German dentists in history, took X-rays of himself in 1896 and is considered a pioneer in dental radiology. He described the required exposure time of 25 minutes as an \"ordeal\". Braunschweig's medical community later commissioned him to set up and supervise a central X-ray facility. In 1898, the year radium was discovered, he also tested the use of radium in medicine in a self-experiment using an amount of 0.2 grams of radium bromide. Walkhoff observed that cancerous mice exposed to radium radiation died significantly later than a control group of untreated mice. He thus initiated the development of radiation research for the treatment of tumors.\n\nThe Armenian-American radiologist Mihran Krikor Kassabian (1870-1910), vice president of the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS), was concerned about the irritating effects of X-rays. In a publication, he mentioned his increasing problems with his hands. Although Kassabian recognized X-rays as the cause, he avoided making this reference so as not to hinder the progress of radiology. In 1902, he suffered a severe radiation burn on his hand. Six years later, the hand became necrotic and two fingers of his left hand were amputated. Kassabian kept a diary and photographed his hands as the tissue damage progressed. He died of cancer in 1910.\n\nMany of the early X-ray and radioactivity researchers went down in history as \"martyrs for science.\" In her article, The Miracle and the Martyrs, Sarah Zobel of the University of Vermont tells of a 1920 banquet held to honor many of the pioneers of X-rays. Chicken was served for dinner: \"Shortly after the meal was served, it could be seen that some of the participants were unable to enjoy the meal. After years of working with X-rays, many of the participants had lost fingers or hands due to radiation exposure and were unable to cut the meat themselves\". The first American to die from radiation exposure was Clarence Madison Dally (1845-1904), an assistant to Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). Edison began studying X-rays almost immediately after Röntgen's discovery and delegated the task to Dally. Over time, Dally underwent more than 100 skin operations due to radiation damage. Eventually, both of his arms had to be amputated. His death led Edison to abandon all further X-ray research in 1904.\nOne of the pioneers was the Austrian Gustav Kaiser (1871-1954), who in 1896 succeeded in photographing a double toe with an exposure time of 1½-2 hours. Due to the limited knowledge at the time, he also suffered severe radiation damage to his hands, losing several fingers and his right metacarpal. His work was the basis for, among other things, the construction of lead rubber aprons. Heinrich Albers-Schönberg (1865-1921), the world's first professor of radiology, recommended gonadal protection for testicles and ovaries in 1903. He was one of the first to protect germ cells not only from acute radiation damage but also from small doses of radiation that could accumulate over time and cause late damage. Albers-Schönberg died at the age of 56 from radiation damage, as did Guido Holzknecht and Elizabeth Fleischman.\nSince April 4, 1936, a radiology memorial in the garden of the  of Hamburg's St. Georg Hospital has commemorated the 359 victims from 23 countries who were among the first medical users of X-rays.\n\n\n=== Initial warnings ===\n\nIn 1896, the engineer Wolfram Fuchs, based on his experience with numerous X-ray examinations, recommended keeping the exposure time as short as possible, staying away from the tube, and covering the skin with Vaseline. In 1897, Chicago doctors William Fuchs and Otto Schmidt became the first users to have to pay compensation to a patient for radiation damage.\nIn 1901, dentist William Herbert Rollins (1852-1929) called for using lead-glass goggles when working with X-rays, for the X-ray tube to be encased in lead, and for all areas of the body to be covered with lead aprons. He published over 200 articles on the potential dangers of X-rays, but his suggestions were long ignored. A year later, Rollins wrote in despair that his warnings about the dangers of X-rays were not being heeded by either the industry or his colleagues. By this time, Rollins had demonstrated that X-rays could kill laboratory animals and induce miscarriages in guinea pigs. Rollins' achievements were not recognized until later. Since then, he has gone down in the history of radiology as the \"father of radiation protection. He became a member of the Radiological Society of North America and its first treasurer.\nRadiation protection continued to develop with the invention of new measuring devices such as the chromoradiometer by Guido Holzknecht (1872-1931) in 1902, the radiometer by Raymond Sabouraud (1864-1938) and Henri Noiré (1878–1937) in 1904/05, and the quantimeter by Robert Kienböck (1873-1951) in 1905, which made it possible to determine maximum doses at which there was a high probability that no skin changes would occur. Radium was also included by the British Roentgen Society, which published its first memorandum on radium protection in 1921.\n\n\n=== Unnecessary applications ===\n\n\n==== Pedoscope ====\n\nSince the 1920s, pedoscopes have been installed in many shoe stores in North America and Europe, more than 10,000 in the U.S. alone, following the invention of Jacob Lowe, a Boston physicist. They were X-ray machines used to check the fit of shoes and to promote sales, especially to children. Children were particularly fascinated by the sight of their footbones. X-rays were often taken several times daily to evaluate the fit of different shoes. Most were available in shoe stores until the early 1970s. The energy dose absorbed by the customer was up to 116 rads, or 1.16 grays. In the 1950s, when medical knowledge of the health risks was already available, pedoscopes came with warnings that shoe-buyers should not be scanned more than three times a day and twelve times a year.\nBy the early 1950s, several professional organizations issued warnings against the continued use of shoe-mounted fluoroscopes, including the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, the American College of Surgeons, the New York Academy of Medicine, and the American College of Radiology. At the same time, the District of Columbia enacted regulations requiring that shoe-mounted fluoroscopes be operated only by a licensed physical therapist. A few years later, the state of Massachusetts passed regulations stating that these machines could only be operated by a licensed physician. In 1957, the use of shoe-mounted fluoroscopes was banned by court order in Pennsylvania. By 1960, these measures and pressure from insurance companies led to the disappearance of the shoe-mounted fluoroscope, at least in the United States.\nIn Switzerland, there were 1,500 shoe-mounted fluoroscopes in use, 850 were required to be inspected by the Swiss Electrotechnical Association by a decree of the Federal Department of Home Affairs on October 7, 1963. The last one was decommissioned in 1990.\nIn Germany, the machines were not banned until 1976.   The fluoroscopy machine emitted uncontrolled X-rays, which continuously exposed children, parents, and sales staff. The all-wood cabinet of the machine did not prevent the X-rays from passing through, resulting in particularly high cumulative radiation levels for the cashier when the pedoscope was placed near the cash register. The all-wood cabinet of the machine did not prevent the X-rays from passing through, resulting in particularly high cumulative radiation levels for the cashier when the pedoscope was placed near the cash register. It is clear that the machine was not designed with proper safety measures in place, leading to dangerous levels of radiation exposure. The well-established long-term effects of X-rays, including genetic damage and carcinogenicity, suggest that the use of pedoscopes worldwide over several decades may have contributed to health effects.The well-established long-term effects of X-rays, including genetic damage and carcinogenicity, suggest that the use of pedoscopes worldwide over several decades may have contributed to health effects. However, it cannot be definitively proven that they were the sole cause.  For example, a direct link has been discussed in the case of basal cell carcinoma of the foot. In 1950, a case was published in which a shoe model had to have a leg amputated as a result.\n\n\n==== Radiotherapy ====\n\nIn 1896, Viennese dermatologist Leopold Freund (1868-1943) used X-rays to treat patients for the first time. He successfully irradiated the hairy nevus of a young girl. In 1897, Hermann Gocht (1869–1931) published the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia with X-rays, and Alexei Petrovich Sokolov (1854-1928) wrote about radiotherapy for arthritis in the oldest radiology journal, Advances in the field of X-rays (RöFo). In 1922, X-rays were recommended as safe for many diseases and for diagnostic purposes. Radiation protection was limited to recommending doses that would not cause erythema (reddening of the skin). For example, X-rays were promoted as an alternative to tonsillectomy. It was also boasted that in 80% of cases of diphtheria carriers, Corynebacterium diphtheriae was no longer detectable within two to four days. In the 1930s,  Günther von Pannewitz (1900-1966), a radiologist from Freiburg, Germany, perfected what he called X-ray stimulation radiation for degenerative diseases. Low-dose radiation reduces the inflammatory response of tissues. Until about 1960, children with diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis or favus (head fungus) were irradiated, which was effective but led to increased cancer rates among patients decades later. In 1926, the American pathologist James Ewing (1866-1943) was the first to observe bone changes as a result of radiotherapy, which he described as radiation osteitis (now Osteoradionecrosis). In 1983, Robert E. Marx stated that osteoradionecrosis is radiation-induced aseptic bone necrosis. The acute and chronic inflammatory processes of osteoradionecrosis are prevented by the administration of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, the administration of pentoxifylline and antioxidant treatments, such as superoxide dismutase and tocopherol (vitamin E) are recommended.\n\n\n== Radiation protection during X-ray examinations ==\n\n\n=== Preliminary observation ===\n\nSonography (ultrasound diagnostics) is a versatile and widely used imaging modality in medical diagnostics. Ultrasound is also used in therapy. However, it uses mechanical waves and no ionizing or non-ionizing radiation. Patient safety is ensured if the recommended limits for avoiding cavitation and overheating are observed, see also Safety Aspects of Sonography.\nEven devices that use alternating magnetic fields in the radiofrequency range, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), do not use ionizing radiation. MRI was developed as an imaging technique in 1973 by Paul Christian Lauterbur (1929-2007) with significant contributions from Sir Peter Mansfield (1933-2017). Jewelry or piercings can become very hot; on the other hand, a high tensile force is exerted on the jewelry, which in the worst case can cause it to be torn out. To avoid pain and injury, jewelry containing ferromagnetic metals should be removed beforehand. Pacemakers, defibrillator systems, and large tattoos in the examination area that contain metallic color pigments may heat up or cause second-degree burns or malfunction of the implants.\n\nPhotoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is a hybrid imaging modality that utilizes the photoacoustic effect without the use of ionizing radiation. It works without contact with very fast laser pulses that generate ultrasound in the tissue under examination. The local absorption of the light leads to sudden local heating and the resulting thermal expansion. The result is broadband acoustic waves. The original distribution of absorbed energy can be reconstructed by measuring the outgoing ultrasound waves with appropriate ultrasound transducers.\n\n\n=== Radiation exposure detection ===\n\nIn order to better assess radiation protection, the number of X-ray examinations, including the dose, has been recorded annually in Germany since 2007. However, the Federal Statistical Office does not have complete data for conventional X-ray examinations. In 2014, the total number of X-ray examinations in Germany was estimated to be about 135 million, of which about 55 million were dental X-ray examinations. The average effective dose from x-ray examinations per inhabitant in Germany in 2014 was about 1.55 mSv (about 1.7 x-ray examinations per inhabitant per year). The proportion of dental X-rays is 41%, but accounts for only 0.4% of the collective effective dose.\nIn Germany, Section 28 of the X-ray Ordinance (RöV) has required since 2002 that the attending physician must have an X-ray pass available for X-ray examinations and offer it to the patient. The pass contains information about the patient's X-rays to avoid unnecessary examinations and to allow comparison with previous images. With the entry into force of the new Radiation Protection Ordinance on December 31, 2018, this obligation no longer applies. In Austria and Switzerland, x-ray passports have so far been available voluntarily. In principle, there must always be both a justifiable indication for the use of X-rays and the informed consent of the patient. In the context of medical treatment, informed consent refers to the patient's agreement to all types of interventions and other medical measures.\n\n§ 630d\nAct of (in German)\n\n\n=== Radiation reduction ===\nOver the years, there have been increasing efforts to reduce radiation exposure to therapists and patients.\n\n\n==== Radiation protective clothing ====\n\nFollowing Rollins' discovery in 1920 that lead aprons protected against X-rays, lead aprons with a lead thickness of 0.5 mm were introduced. Due to their weight, lead-free and lead-reduced aprons were subsequently developed. In 2005, it was recognized that in some cases the protection was significantly less than wearing lead aprons. The lead-free aprons contain tin, antimony and barium, which have the property of producing intense radiation (X-ray fluorescence radiation) when irradiated. In Germany, the Radiology Standards Committee has taken up the issue and introduced a German standard (DIN 6857-1) in 2009. The international standard IEC 61331-3:2014 was finally published in 2014. Protective aprons that do not comply with DIN 6857-1 of 2009 or the new IEC 61331-1 of 2014 may result in higher exposures. There are two classes of lead equivalency classes: 0.25 mm and 0.35 mm. The manufacturer must specify the area weight in kg/m² at which the protective effect of a pure lead apron of 0.25 or 0.35 mm Pb is achieved. The protective effect of an apron shall be appropriate to the energy range used, up to 110 kV for low energy aprons and up to 150 kV for high energy aprons.\nIf necessary, lead glass panels must also be used, with the front panels having a lead equivalent of 0.5-1.0 mm, depending on the application, and the side shields having a lead equivalent of 0.5-0.75 mm.\nOutside the useful beam, radiation exposure is primarly caused by scattered radiation from the tissue being scanned. During examinations of the head and torso, this scattered radiation can spread throughout the body and is difficult to shield with radiation protective clothing. Fears that a lead apron will prevent radiation from leaving the body are unfounded, however, because lead absorbs radiation rather than scattering it.\nWhen preparing an orthopantomogram (OPG) for a dental overview radiograph, it is sometimes recommended not to wear a lead apron, as it does little to shield scattered radiation from the jaw area, but may hinder the rotation of the imaging device. However, according to the 2018 X-ray regulation, it is still mandatory to wear a lead apron when taking an OPG.\n\n\n==== X-ray intensifier foils ====\nIn the same year as the discovery of X-rays, Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin (1858-1935) invented the method of placing a sheet of paper coated with fluorescent substances on the photographic plate, drastically reducing the exposure time and thus the radiation exposure. 95% of the film was blackened by the intensifying film and only the remaining 5% was directly blackened by the X-rays. Thomas Alva Edison identified the blue-emitting calcium tungstate (CaWO4) as a suitable phosphor, which quickly became the standard for X-ray intensifying film. In the 1970s, calcium tungstate was replaced by even better and finer intensifying films with rare earth-based phosphors (terbium-activated lanthanum oxybromide, gadolinium oxysulfide). The use of intensifying films in dental film production did not become widespread because of the loss of image quality. The combination with high-sensitivity films further reduced radiation exposure.\n\n\n==== Anti-scatter grid ====\nAn anti-scatter grid is a device in X-ray technology that is placed in front of the image receiver (screen, detector, or film) and reduces the incidence of diffuse radiation on it. The first diffusion radiation grid was developed in 1913 by Gustav Peter Bucky (1880-1963). The US radiologist Hollis Elmer Potter (1880-1964) improved it in 1917 by adding a moving device. The radiation dose must be increased when using scattered radiation grids. For this reason, the use of scattered radiation equipment should not be used on children. In digital radiography, a grid may be omitted under certain conditions to reduce radiation exposure to the patient.\n\n\n==== Radiation protection splint ====\n\nRadiation protection measures may also be necessary against scattered radiation, which occurs during tumor irradiation of the head and neck on metal parts of the dentition (dental fillings, bridges, etc.). Since the 1990s, soft tissue retractors known as radiation protection splints have been used to prevent or reduce mucositis, an inflammation of the mucous membranes. It is the most significant adverse acute side effect of radiation. The radiation protection splint is a spacer that keeps the mucosa away from the teeth and reduces the amount of scattered radiation that hits the mucosa according to the square law of distance. Mucositis, which is extremely painful, is one of the most significant detriments to a patient's quality of life and often limits radiation therapy, thereby reducing the chances of tumor cure. The splint reduces oral mucosal reactions that typically occur in the second and third third of a radiation series and are irreversible.\n\n\n==== Panoramic X-ray machine ====\n\nThe Japanese Hisatugu Numata developed the first panoramic radiograph in 1933/34. This was followed by the development of intraoral panoramic X-ray units, in which the X-ray tube is placed intraorally (inside the mouth) and the X-ray film extraorally (outside the mouth). At the same time, Horst Beger from Dresden in 1943 and the Swiss dentist Walter Ott in 1946 worked on the Panoramix (Koch & Sterzel), Status X (Siemens) and Oralix (Philips). Intraoral panoramic devices were discontinued at the end of the 1980s because the radiation exposure was too high in direct contact with the tongue and oral mucosa due to the intraoral tube.\n\n\n==== Digital X-ray ====\nEastman Kodak filed the first patent for digital radiography in 1973. The first commercial CR (Computed Radiology) solution was offered by Fujifilm in Japan in 1983 under the device name CR-101. X-ray imaging plates are used in X-ray diagnostics to record the shadow image of X-rays. The first commercial digital X-ray system for use in dentistry was introduced in 1986 by Trophy Radiology (France) under the name Radiovisiography. Digital x-ray systems help reduce radiation exposure. Instead of film, the machines contain a scintillator that converts the incident X-ray photons either into visible light or directly into electrical impulses.\n\n\n==== Computer tomography ====\nIn 1972, the first commercial CT scanner for clinical use went into operation at Atkinsons Morley Hospital in London. Its inventor was the English engineer Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield (1919-2004), who shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Allan McLeod Cormack (1924-1998) for his pioneering work in the field of computed tomography. The first steps toward dose reduction were taken in 1989 in the era of single-slice spiral CT. The introduction of multi-slice spiral computed tomography in 1998 and its continuous development made it possible to reduce the dose by means of dose modulation. The tube current is adjusted, for example by reducing the power for images of the lungs compared to the abdomen. The tube current is modulated during rotation. Because the human body has an approximately oval cross-section, radiation intensity is reduced when radiation is delivered from the front or back, and is increased when radiation is delivered from the side. This dose control also depends on the body mass index. For example, the use of dose modulation in the head and neck region reduces total exposure and organ doses to the thyroid and eye lens by up to 50% without significantly compromising diagnostic image quality. The Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) is used to measure radiation exposure during a CT scan. The CTDI was first defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981. The unit of measurement for the CTDI is the mGy (milli-Gray). Multiplying the CTDI by the length of the examination volume yields the dose-length product (DLP), which quantifies the total radiation exposure to the patient during a CT scan.\n\n\n==== Structural protective measures ====\n\nAn X-ray room must be shielded on all sides with 1 mm lead equivalent shielding. Calcium silicate or solid brick masonry is recommended. A steel jamb should be used, not only because of the weight of the heavy shielding door but also because of the shielding; wooden frames must be shielded separately. The shielding door must be covered with a 1 mm thick lead foil and a lead glass window must be installed as a visual connection. A keyhole shall be avoided. All installations (sanitary or electrical), that interrupt the radiation protection, must be leaded (\n\n§ 20\n§ 20 Röntgenverordnung (röv_1987) [§ 20 X-ray Ordinance] (in German)\nand\n\n§ Annex+2\nAnnex 2 (to § 8 para. 1 sentence 1 RöV) (röv_1987) (in German)\nDepending on the application, nuclear medicine requires even more extensive protective measures, up to and including concrete walls several meters thick. In addition, from December 31, 2018, when the latest amendments to Section 14 (1) No. 2b of the Radiation Protection Act\n\n§ 14\nStrahlenschutzgesetz – StrlSchG [Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG)] (in German)\ncome into force, an expert in medical physics for X-ray diagnostics and therapy must be consulted for the optimization and quality assurance of the application and for advice on radiation protection issues.\n\n\n=== Certificate of competence ===\n\nEach facility operating an x-ray unit shall have sufficient personnel with appropriate expertise. The person responsible for radiation protection or one or more Radiation Safety Officers shall have appropriate qualifications, which shall be regularly updated. X-ray examinations may be technically performed by any other staff member of a medical or dental practice if they are under the direct supervision and responsibility of the person responsible and if they have knowledge of radiation protection.\nThis knowledge of radiation protection has been required since the amendment of the X-ray Ordinance in 1987; medical and dental assistants (then called medical assistants or dental assistants) received this additional training in 1990. The regulations for the specialty of radiology were tightened by the Radiation Protection Act, which came into force on October 1, 2017.\nThe handling of radioactive substances and ionizing radiation (if not covered by the X-ray Ordinance) is regulated by the Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV). Section 30 StrlSchV\n\n§ 30\nStrlSchV (in German)\ndefines the \"Required expertise and knowledge in radiation protection\".\n\n\n=== Radiation protection associations ===\nThe Association of German Radiation Protection Physicians (VDSÄ) was formed in the late 1950s from a working group of radiation protection physicians of the German Red Cross and was founded in 1964. It was dedicated to the promotion of radiation protection and the representation of medical, dental, and veterinary radiation protection concerns to the public and the health care system. In 2017, it was merged into the Professional Association for Radiation Protection. The Austrian Association for Radiation Protection (ÖVS), founded in 1966, pursues the same goals as the Association for Medical Radiation Protection in Austria. The Professional Association for Radiation Protection for Germany and Switzerland is networked worldwide.\n\n\n== Radiation protection in radiotherapy ==\nIn radiotherapy, radiation protection is often overlooked in favor of structural safeguards and therapist protection. The benefit/risk assessment should prioritize both the therapeutic goal of treating the patient's cancer and the safety of all involved. However, it is crucial to ensure that radiation is delivered only where it is needed through appropriate treatment planning. By employing strong radiation protection measures, we can confidently provide effective treatment while minimizing potential risks. Linear accelerators replaced cobalt and caesium emitters in routine therapy due to their superior technical characteristics and risk profile. They have been available since about 1970. The presence of a medical physicist responsible for technical quality control is required for linear accelerators, unlike X-rays and telecurie systems. It is important to note that radiation necrosis is the necrosis of cells in an organism caused by the effects of ionizing radiation. Radionecrosis is a serious complication of radiosurgical treatment that becomes clinically apparent months or years after irradiation. Radiation therapy has significantly reduced the incidence of radionecrosis since its early days. Modern radiation techniques prioritize the sparing of healthy tissue while irradiating as much of the area around the tumor as possible to prevent recurrence. It is important to note that patients undergoing radiotherapy face a certain level of radiation risk.\n\n\n== Radiation protection and radiation damage in veterinary medicine ==\n\nWhile there is limited literature on radiation injury to animals, there is no evidence of other types of radiation injury. Diagnostic radiation has been shown to cause local burns in animals, typically resulting from prolonged exposure of body parts or sparks from old x-ray tubes. It is important to note that the frequency of injury to veterinary staff and veterinarians is significantly lower than that in human medicine, highlighting the safety of diagnostic radiation in veterinary practice. In veterinary medicine, fewer images are taken compared to human medicine, particularly fewer CT scans. However, due to the manual restraint of animals to avoid anesthesia, at least one person is present in the control area, resulting in significantly higher radiation exposure than that of human medical staff. It is important to note that since the 1970s, dosimeters have been used to measure the radiation exposure of veterinary personnel, ensuring their safety.\nFeline hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) is a common disease in older cats. Radioiodine therapy is considered by many authors to be the treatment of choice. Following the administration of radioactive iodine, cats are kept in an isolation pen. The cat's radioactivity is measured to determine the time of discharge, which is typically 14 days after the start of therapy. The therapy requires significant radiation protection measures and is currently only offered at two veterinary facilities in Germany (as of 2010). After the start of treatment, cats must be kept indoors for four weeks, and contact with pregnant women and children under the age of 16 must be avoided due to residual radioactivity.\nJust like a medical practice, any veterinary practice operating an X-ray machine must have sufficient staff with the appropriate expertise, as required by Section 18 of the X-Ray Ordinance 2002. The corresponding training for paraveterinary workers (then called veterinary nurses) took place in 1990.\nIn 2017, Linsengericht (Hesse) opened Europe's first clinic for horses with cancer. Radiation therapy is administered in a treatment room that is eight meters wide, on a specially designed table that can withstand heavyweight. The surrounding area is protected from radiation by three-meter thick walls. Mobile equipment is used to irradiate tumors in small animals at various locations. \n\n\n== Radioactive substances ==\n\n\n=== Radon ===\n\nRadon is a naturally occurring radioactive noble gas discovered in 1900 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn (1848-1916) and is considered carcinogenic. Radon is increasingly found in areas with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These are mainly areas with high granitic rock deposits. According to studies by the World Health Organization, the incidence of lung cancer increases significantly at radiation levels of 100-200 Bq per cubic meter of indoor air. The likelihood of developing lung cancer increases by 10% with each additional 100 Bq/m³ of indoor air.\n\nElevated radon levels have been measured in numerous areas in Germany, particularly in southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nThe Federal Office for Radiation Protection has developed a radon map of Germany. The EU Directive 2013/59/Euratom (Radiation Protection Basic Standards Directive) introduced reference levels and the possibility for workers to have their workplace tested for radon exposure. In Germany, it was implemented in the Radiation Protection Act (Chapter 2 or Sections 124-132 StrlSchG)\n\n§ 124-132\nStrlSchG (in German)\nand the amended Radiation Protection Ordinance (Part 4 Chapter 1, Sections 153-158 StrlSchV).\n\n§ 153-158\nAct of (in German)\nThe new radon protection regulations for workplaces and new residential buildings have been binding since January 2019. Extensive radon contamination and radon precautionary areas have been determined by the ministries of the environment of the federal states (as of June 15, 2021).\n\n\n==== Austria ====\nThe highest radon concentrations in Austria were measured in 1991 in the municipality of Umhausen in Tyrol. Umhausen has about 2300 inhabitants and is located in the Ötztal valley. Some of the houses there were built on a bedrock of granite gneiss. From this porous subsoil, the radon present in the rock seeped freely into the unsealed cellars, which were contaminated with up to 60,000 Becquerels of radon per cubic meter of air. Radon levels in the apartments in Umhausen have been systematically monitored since 1992. Since then, extensive radon mitigation measures have been implemented in the buildings: New buildings, sealing of cellar floors, forced ventilation of cellars or relocation. Queries in the Austrian Health Information System (ÖGIS) have shown that the incidence of new cases of lung cancer has declined sharply since then. The Austrian National Radon Project (ÖNRAP) has studied radon exposure throughout the country. Austria also has a Radiation Protection Act as a legal basis. Indoor limits were set in 2008  The Austrian Ministry of the Environment states that\n\n\"Precautionary measures in radiation protection use the generally accepted model that the risk of lung cancer increases uniformly (linearly) with radon concentration. This means that an increased risk of lung cancer does not only occur above a certain value, but that a guideline or limit value only adjusts the magnitude of the risk in a meaningful way to other existing risks. Achieving a guideline or limit therefore means taking a risk that is still (socially) acceptable. It therefore makes perfect sense to take simple measures to reduce radon levels, even if they are below the guideline values.\"\nIn Austria, the Radon Protection Ordinance in its version of September 10, 2021 is currently in force, which also defines the radon protection areas and radon precautionary areas.\n\n\n==== Switzerland ====\nThe aim of the Radon Action Plan 2012-2020 in Switzerland was to incorporate the new international recommendations into the Swiss strategy for protection against radon and thus reduce the number of lung cancer cases attributable to radon in buildings.\nOn 1 January 2018, the limit value of 1000 Bq/m³ was replaced by a reference value of 300 becquerels per cubic meter (Bq/m³) for the radon gas concentration averaged over a year in \"rooms in which people regularly spend several hours a day\".\nSubsequently, on May 11, 2020, the Federal Office of Public Health FOPH issued the Radon Action Plan 2021-2030. The provisions on radon protection are primarily laid down in the Radiation Protection Ordinance (RPO).\n\n\n==== Radiation sickness among miners ====\n\nIn 1879, Walther Hesse (1846-1911) and Friedrich Hugo Härting published the study \"Lung Cancer, the Miners' Disease in the Schneeberg Mines\". Hesse, a pathologist, was shocked by the poor health and young age of the miners. This particular form of bronchial carcinoma was given the name Schneeberg disease because it occurred among miners in the Schneeberg mines (Saxon Erz Mountains).\nWhen Hesse's report was published, radioactive radiation and the existence of radon were unknown. It was not until 1898 that Marie Curie-Skłodowska (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) discovered radium and created the concept of radioactivity. Beginning in the fall of 1898, Marie Curie suffered from inflammation of the fingertips, the first known symptoms of radiation sickness.\nIn the Jáchymov mines, where silver and non-ferrous metals were mined from the 16th to the 19th century, uranium ore was mined in abundance in the 20th century. It was only during the Second World War that restrictions were imposed on ore mining in the Schneeberg and Jáchymov mines. After World War II, uranium mining was accelerated for the Soviet atomic bomb project and the emerging Soviet nuclear industry. Forced labor was used. Initially, these were German prisoners of war and displaced persons, and after the February Revolution of 1948, political prisoners were imprisoned by the Communist Party regime in Czechoslovakia, as well as conscripted civilian workers. Several \"Czechoslovak gulags\" were established in the area to house these workers. In all, about 100,000 political prisoners and more than 250,000 forced laborers passed through the camps. About half of them probably did not survive the mining work. Uranium mining ceased in 1964. We can only speculate about other victims who died as a result of radiation. Radon-bearing springs discovered during the mining in the early 20th century established a spa industry that is still important today, as well as the town's status as the oldest radium brine spa in the world.\n\n\n==== Wismut AG ====\nThe approximately 200,000 uranium miners employed by Wismut AG in the former Soviet occupation zone of East Germany were exposed to very high levels of radiation, particularly between 1946 and 1955, but also in later years. This exposure was caused by the inhalation of radon and its radioactive by-products, which were deposited to a considerable extent in the inhaled dust. Radiation exposure was expressed in the historical unit of working level month (WLM). This unit of measurement was introduced in the 1950s specifically for occupational safety in uranium mines in the U.S. to record radiation exposure resulting from radioactive exposure to radon and its decay products in the air we breathe. Approximately 9000 workers at Wismut AG have been diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\n=== Radium ===\n\nUntil the 1930s, radium compounds were not only considered relatively harmless, but also beneficial to health, and were advertised as medicines for a variety of ailments or used in products that glowed in the dark. Processing took place without any safeguards.\n\nUntil the 1960s, radioactivity was often handled naively and carelessly. From 1940 to 1945, the Berlin-based Auergesellschaft, founded by Carl Auer von Welsbach (1858-1929, Osram), produced a radioactive toothpaste called Doramad that contained thorium-X and was sold internationally. It was advertised with the statement, \"Its radioactive radiation strengthens the defenses of the teeth and gums. The cells are charged with new life energy and the destructive effect of bacteria is inhibited. This gave the claim of radiant white teeth a double meaning. By 1930, there were also bath additives and eczema ointments under the brand name \"Thorium-X\". Radium was also added to toothpastes, such as Kolynos toothpaste. After World War I, radioactivity became a symbol of modern achievement and was considered \"chic\". Radioactive substances were added to mineral water, condoms, and cosmetic powders. Even chocolate laced with radium was sold. The toy manufacturer Märklin in the Swabian town of Göppingen tested the sale of an X-ray machine for children. At upper-class parties, people \"photographed\" each other's bones for fun. A system called Trycho (Ancient Greek: τριχο-, romanized: tricho-, lit. 'concerning the hair') for epilation (hair removal) of the face and body was franchised in the USA. As a result, thousands of women suffered skin burns, ulcers and tumors. It was not until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that the public became aware of the dangers of ionizing radiation and these products were banned.\nA radium industry developed, using radium in creams, beverages, chocolates, toothpastes, and soaps. It took a relatively long time for radium and its decay product radon to be recognized as the cause of the observed effects. Radithor, a radioactive agent consisting of triple-distilled water in which the radium isotopes 226Ra and 228Ra were dissolved so that it had an activity of at least one microcurie, was marketed in the United States. It was not until 1932, when the prominent American athlete Eben Byers, who by his own account had taken about 1,400 vials of Radithor as medicine on the recommendation of his physician, fell seriously ill with cancer, lost many of his teeth, and died shortly thereafter in great agony, that strong doubts were raised about the healing powers of Radithor and radium water.\n\n\n==== Radium cures ====\n\n1908 saw a boom in the use of radioactive water for therapeutic purposes. The discovery of springs in Oberschlema and Bad Brambach paved the way for the establishment of radium spas, which relied on the healing properties of radium. During the cures, people bathed in radium water, drank cures with radium water, and inhaled radon in emanatoriums. The baths were visited by tens of thousands of people every year, hoping for hormesis.\nTo this day, therapeutic applications are carried out in spas and healing tunnels. The natural release of radon from the ground is used. According to the German Spa Association, the activity in water must be at least 666 Bq/liter. The requirement for inhalation treatments is at least 37,000 Bq/m³ of air. This form of therapy is not scientifically accepted and the potential risk of radiation exposure is criticized. The equivalent dose of a radon cure in Germany is given by the individual health resorts as about one to two millisieverts, depending on the location. In 2010, doctors in Erlangen, using the (outdated) LNT (Linear, No-Threshold) model, concluded that five percent of all lung cancer deaths in Germany are caused by radon. There are radon baths in Bad Gastein, Bad Hofgastein and Bad Zell in Austria, in Niška Banja in Serbia, in the radon revitalization bath in Menzenschwand and in Bad Brambach, Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg, Bad Schlema, Bad Steben, Bad Schmiedeberg and Sibyllenbad in Germany, in Jáchymov in the Czech Republic, in Hévíz in Hungary, in Świeradów-Zdrój (Bad Flinsberg) in Poland, in Naretschen and Kostenez in Bulgaria and on the island of Ischia in Italy. There are radon tunnels in Bad Kreuznach and Bad Gastein.\n\n\n==== Illuminated dials ====\n\nThe dangers of radium were recognized in the early 1920s and first described in 1924 by New York dentist and oral surgeon Theodor Blum (1883-1962). He was particularly aware of the use of radium in the watch industry, where it was used for luminous dials. He published an article on the clinical picture of the so-called radium jaw. He observed this disease in female patients who, as dial painters, came into contact with luminous paint whose composition was similar to Radiomir, a luminous material invented in 1914 consisting of a mixture of zinc sulfide and radium bromide. As they painted, they used their lips to form the tip of the phosphorus-laden brush into the desired pointed shape, and this is how the radioactive radium entered their bodies. In the U.S. and Canada alone, about 4,000 workers were affected over the years. In retrospect, the factory workers were called the Radium Girls. They also played with the paint, painting their fingernails, teeth and faces. This made them glow at night to the surprise of their companions.\n\nAfter Harrison Stanford Martland (1883-1954), chief medical examiner in Essex County, detected the radioactive noble gas radon (a decay product of radium) in the breath of the Radium Girls, he turned to Charles Norris (1867-1935) and Alexander Oscar Gettler (1883-1968). In 1928, Gettler was able to detect a high concentration of radium in the bones of Amelia Maggia, one of the young women, even five years after her death. In 1931, a method was developed for determining radium dosage using a film dosimeter. A standard preparation is irradiated through a hardwood cube onto an X-ray film, which is then blackened. For a long time, the cube minute was an important unit of radium dosage. It was calibrated by ionometric measurements. The radiologists Hermann Georg Holthusen (1886-1971) and Anna Hamann (1894-1969) found a calibration value of 0.045 r/min in 1932/1935. The calibration film receives the y-ray dose of 0.045 r per minute through the wooden cube from the preparation of 13.33 mg. In 1933, the physicist Robley D. Evans (1907-1995) made the first measurements of radon and radium in the excretions of female workers. On this basis, the National Bureau of Standards, the predecessor to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), set the limit for radium at 0.1 microcuries (about 3.7 kilobecquerels) in 1941.\nA Radium Action Plan 2015-2019 aims to solve the problem of radiological contamination in Switzerland, mainly in the Jura Mountains, due to the use of radium luminous paint in the watch industry until the 1960s.\nIn France, a line of cosmetics called Tho-Radia, which contained both thorium and radium, was created in 1932 and lasted until the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Other terrestrial radiation ===\n\nTerrestrial radiation is the ubiquitous radiation on Earth caused by radionuclides in the ground that were formed billions of years ago by stellar nucleosynthesis and have not yet decayed due to their long half-lives. Terrestrial radiation is caused by natural radionuclides that occur naturally in the Earth's soil, rocks, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Natural radionuclides can be divided into cosmogenic and primordial nuclides. Cosmogenic nuclides do not contribute significantly to the terrestrial ambient radiation at the Earth's surface. The sources of terrestrial radiation are the natural radioactive nuclides found in the uppermost layers of the Earth, in the water and in the air. These include in particular\n\nThorium-232 (half-life 14 billion years),\nUranium-238 (half-life 4.4 billion years),\nUranium-235 (half-life 0.7 billion years) and\nPotassium-40 (half-life 1.3 billion years).\n\n\n==== Mining and extraction of fuels ====\nAccording to the World Nuclear Association, coal from all deposits contains traces of various radioactive substances, particularly radon, uranium and thorium. These substances are released during coal mining, especially from surface mines, through power plant emissions, or power plant ash, and contribute to terrestrial radiation exposure through their exposure pathways.\nIn December 2009, it was revealed that oil and gas production generates millions of tons of radioactive waste each year, much of which is improperly disposed of without detection, including 226Radium and 210Polonium. The specific activity of the waste ranges from 0.1 to 15,000 becquerels per gram. In Germany, according to the Radiation Protection Ordinance of 2001, the material is subject to monitoring at one Becquerel per gram and would have to be disposed of separately. The implementation of this regulation has been left to the industry, which has disposed of the waste carelessly and improperly for decades.\n\n\n==== Building material ====\n\nEvery building material contains traces of natural radioactive substances, especially 238uranium, 232thorium, and their decay products, and 40potassium. Solidified and effusive rocks such as granite, tuff, and pumice have higher levels of radioactivity. In contrast, sand, gravel, limestone, and natural gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) have low levels of radioactivity. The European Union's Activity Concentration Index (ACI), developed in 1999, can be used to assess radiation exposure from building materials. It replaces the Leningrad summation formula, which was used in 1971 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) to determine how much radiation exposure from building materials is permissible for humans. The ACI is calculated from the sum of the weighted activities of 40potassium, 226radium, and 232thorium. The weighting takes into account the relative harmfulness to humans. According to official recommendations, building materials with a European ACI value greater than \"1\" should not be used in large quantities.\n\n\n==== Glazes ====\nUranium pigments are used to color ceramic tiles with uranium glazes (red, yellow, brown), where 2 mg of uranium per cm² is allowed. Between 1900 and 1943, large quantities of uranium-containing ceramics were produced in the United States, as well as in Germany and Austria. It is estimated that between 1924 and 1943, 50-150 tons of uranium (V,VI) oxide were used annually in the U.S. to produce uranium-containing glazes. In 1943, the U.S. government imposed a ban on the civilian use of uranium-containing substances, which remained in effect until 1958. Beginning in 1958, the U.S. government, and in 1969 the United States Atomic Energy Commission, sold depleted uranium in the form of uranium(VI) fluoride for civilian use. In Germany, uranium-glazed ceramics were produced by the Rosenthal porcelain factory and were commercially available until the early 1980s. Uranium-glazed ceramics should only be used as collector's items and not for everyday use due to possible abrasion.\n\n\n=== ODL measurement network ===\n\nThe Federal Office for Radiation Protection's monitoring network measures natural radiation exposure through the local dose rate (ODL), expressed in microsieverts per hour (μSv/h).  In Germany, the natural ODL ranges from approximately 0.05 to 0.18 μSv/h, depending on local conditions. The ODL monitoring network has been operational since 1973 and currently comprises 1800 fixed, automatically operating measuring points. Its primary function is to provide early warning for the rapid detection of increased radiation from radioactive substances in the air in Germany. Spectroscopic probes have been successfully utilized since 2008 to determine the contribution of artificial radionuclides in addition to the local dose rate, showcasing the network's advanced capabilities. In addition to the ODL monitoring network of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, there are other federal monitoring networks at the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency and the Federal Institute of Hydrology, which measure gamma radiation in water; the German Meteorological Service measures air activity with aerosol samplers. To monitor nuclear facilities, the relevant federal states operate their own ODL monitoring networks. The data from these monitoring networks are automatically fed into the Integrated Measurement and Information System (IMIS), where they are used to analyze the current situation.\nMany countries operate their own ODL monitoring networks to protect the public. In Europe, these data are collected and published on the EURDEP platform of the European Atomic Energy Community. The European monitoring networks are based on Articles 35 and 37 of the Euratom Treaty.\n\n\n=== Radionuclides in medicine ===\n\nNuclear medicine is the use of open radionuclides for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes (radionuclide therapy). It also includes the use of other radioactive substances and nuclear physics techniques for functional and localization diagnostics. George de Hevesy (1885-1966) lived as a lodger and in 1923 suspected that his landlady was offering him pudding that he had not eaten the following week. He mixed a small amount of a radioactive isotope into the leftovers. When she served him the pudding a week later, he was able to detect radioactivity in a sample of the casserole. When he showed this to his landlady, she immediately gave him notice. The method he used made him the father of nuclear medicine. It became known as the tracer method, which is still used today in nuclear medicine diagnostics. A small amount of a radioactive substance, its distribution in the organism, and its path through the human body can be tracked externally. This provides information about various metabolic functions of the body. The continuous development of radionuclides has improved radiation protection. For example, the mercury compounds 203chloro-merodrin and 197chloro-merodrin were abandoned in the 1960s as substances were developed that allowed a higher photon yield with less radiation exposure. Beta emitters such as 131I and 90Y are used in radionuclide therapy. In nuclear medicine diagnostics, the beta+ emitters 18F, 11C, 13N, and 15O are used as radioactive markers for tracers in positron emission tomography (PET). Radiopharmaceuticals (isotope-labeled drugs) are being developed on an ongoing basis.\nRadiopharmaceutical residues, such as empty application syringes and contaminated residues from the patient's toilet, shower and washing water, are collected in tanks and stored until they can be safely pumped into the sewer system. The storage time depends on the half-life and ranges from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the radionuclide. Since 2001, by\n\n§ 29\nStrlSchV (in German)\nof the Radiation Protection Ordinance, the specific radioactivity in the waste containers has been recorded in release measuring stations and the release time is calculated automatically. This requires measurements of the sample activity in Bq/g and the surface contamination in Bq/cm². In addition, the behavior of the patients after their discharge from the clinic is prescribed. To protect personnel, syringe filling systems, borehole measurement stations for nuclide-specific measurement of low-activity, small volume individual samples, a lift system into the measurement chamber to reduce radiation exposure when handling highly active samples, probe measurement stations, ILP (isolated limb perfusion) measurement stations to monitor activity with one or more detectors during surgery and report leakage to the surgical oncologist.\n\n\n==== Radioiodine therapy ====\n\nRadioiodine Therapy (RIT) is a nuclear medicine procedure used to treat thyroid hyperfunction, Graves' disease, thyroid enlargement, and certain forms of thyroid cancer. The radioactive iodine isotope used is 131Iodine, a predominant beta emitter with a half-life of eight days, which is only stored in thyroid cells in the human body. In 1942, Saul Hertz (1905-1950) of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the physicist Arthur Roberts published their report on the first radioiodine therapy (1941) for Graves' disease, at that time still predominantly using the 130iodine isotope with a half-life of 12.4 hours. At the same time, Joseph Gilbert Hamilton (1907-1957) and John Hundale Lawrence (1904-1991) performed the first therapy with 131iodine, the isotope still used today.\nRadioiodine therapy is subject to special legal regulations in many countries, and in Germany may only be performed on an inpatient basis. There are approximately 120 treatment centers in Germany (as of 2014), performing approximately 50,000 treatments per year. In Germany, the minimum length of stay is 48 hours. Discharge depends on the residual activity remaining in the body. In 1999, the limit for residual activity was raised. The dose rate may not exceed 3.5 µSv per hour at a distance of 2 meters from the patient, which means that a radiation exposure of 1 mSv may not be exceeded within one year at a distance of 2 meters. This corresponds to a residual activity of about 250 MBq. Similar regulations exist in Austria.\nIn Switzerland, a maximum radiation exposure of 1 mSv per year and a maximum of 5 mSv per year for the patient's relatives may not be exceeded. After discharge following radioiodine therapy, a maximum dose rate of 5 µSv per hour at a distance of 1 meter is permitted, which corresponds to a residual activity of approximately 150 MBq. In the event of early discharge, the supervisory authority must be notified up to a dose rate of 17.5 µSv/h; above 17.5 µSv/h, permission must be obtained. If the patient is transferred to another ward, the responsible radiation protection officer must ensure that appropriate radiation protection measures are taken there, e.g. that a temporary control area is set up.\n\n\n==== Scintigraphy ====\n\nScintigraphy is a nuclear medicine procedure in which low-level radioactive substances are injected into the patient for diagnostic purposes. These include bone scintigraphy, thyroid scintigraphy, octreotide scintigraphy , and, as a further development of the procedure, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For example, 201Tl thallium(I) chloride, technetium compounds (99mTc tracer, 99mtechnetium tetrofosmin), PET tracers (with radiation exposure of 1100 MBq each with 15O-water, 555 MBq with 13N ammonia, or 1850 MBq with 82Rb rubidium chloride) are used in myocardial scintigraphy to diagnose blood flow conditions and function of the heart muscle (myocardium). The examination with 74 MBq 201Thallium Chloride causes a radiation exposure of about 16 mSv (effective dose equivalent), the examination with 740 MBq 99mTechnetium-MIBI about 7 mSv. Metastable 99mTc is by far the most important nuclide used as a tracer in scintigraphy because of its short half-life, the 140 keV gamma radiation it emits, and its ability to bind to many active biomolecules. Most of this radiation is excreted after the examination. The remaining 99mTc decays rapidly to 99Tc with a half-life of 6 hours. This has a long half-life of 212,000 years and, because of the relatively weak beta radiation released during its decay, contributes only a small amount of additional radiation exposure over the remaining lifetime. In the United States alone, approximately seven million individual doses of 99mTc are administered each year for diagnostic purposes.\nTo reduce radiation exposure, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) issued dosage recommendations in 2010. The effective dose is 2.4 mSv for 13N-ammonia, 2.5 mSv for 15O-water, 7 mSv for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and 13.5 mSv for 82Rb-rubidium chloride. Compliance with these recommendations is expected to reduce the average radiation exposure to ≤ 9 mSv. The Ordinance on Radioactive Drugs or Drugs Treated with Ionizing Radiation\n\n§ 2\nAMRadV (in German)\nregulates the approval procedures for the marketability of radioactive drugs.\n\n\n==== Brachytherapy ====\n\nBrachytherapy is used to place a sealed radioactive source inside or near the body to treat cancer, such as prostate cancer. Afterloading brachytherapy is often combined with teletherapy, which is external radiation delivered from a greater distance than brachytherapy. It is not classified as a nuclear medicine procedure, although like nuclear medicine, it uses the radiation emitted by radionuclides. After initial interest in brachytherapy in the early 20th century, its use declined in the mid-20th century because of the radiation exposure to physicians from manual handling of the radiation sources. It was not until the development of remote-controlled afterloading systems and the use of new radiation sources in the 1950s and 1960s that the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to physicians and patients was reduced. In the afterloading procedure, an empty, tubular applicator is inserted into the target volume (e.g., the uterus) before the actual therapy and, after checking the position, loaded with a radioactive preparation. The preparation is located at the tip of a steel wire that is advanced and retracted step by step under computer control. After the pre-calculated time, the source is withdrawn into a safe and the applicator is removed. The procedure is used for breast cancer, bronchial carcinoma or oral floor carcinoma, among others. Beta emitters such as 90Sr or 106Ru or 192Ir are used. As a precaution, patients undergoing permanent brachytherapy are advised not to hold small children immediately after treatment and not to be in the vicinity of pregnant women, since low-dose radioactive sources (seeds) remain in the body after treatment with permanent brachytherapy. This is to protect the particularly radiation-sensitive tissues of a fetus or infant.\n\n\n==== Thorium as a drug and X-ray contrast agent ====\n\nRadioactive thorium was used in the 1950s and 60s to treat tuberculosis and other benign diseases (including children), with serious consequences (see Peteosthor). A stabilized suspension of colloidal thorium(IV) oxide, co-developed by António Egas Moniz (1874-1954), was used from 1929 under the trade name Thorotrast as an X-ray contrast agent for angiography in several million patients worldwide until it was banned in the mid-1950s. It accumulates in the reticulohistiocytic system and can lead to cancer due to locally increased radiation exposure. The same is true for cholangiocarcinoma and angiosarcoma of the liver, two rare liver cancers. Carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses have also been described following administration of Thorotrast. Typical onset of disease is 30-35 years after exposure. The biological half-life of Thorotrast is approximately 400 years. The largest study in this area was conducted in Germany in 2004 and showed a particularly high mortality rate among patients exposed in this way. The median life expectancy over a seventy-year observation period was 14 years shorter than in the comparison group.\n\n\n== Nuclear weapons and nuclear energy ==\n\n\n=== Radiation effects of the atomic bomb attack and consequences for radiation protection ===\n\nAfter the U.S. atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, an additional 130,000 people - in addition to the 100,000 immediate victims - died from the effects of radiation by the end of 1945. Some experienced the so-called walking ghost phase, an acute radiation sickness caused by a high equivalent dose of 6 to 20 Sievert after a lethal whole-body dose. The phase describes the period of apparent recovery of a patient between the onset of the first massive symptoms and the inevitable death. In the years that followed, a number of deaths from radiation-induced diseases were added. In Japan, the radiation-damaged survivors are called hibakusha (Japanese: 被爆者, lit. ''Explosion victim'') and are conservatively estimated to number about 100,000.\n\nIn 1946, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was established by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences by order of U.S. President Harry S. Truman to study the long-term effects of radiation on survivors of the atomic bombings. In 1975, the ABCC was replaced by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF). Organizations such as the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), founded in 1955, and the National Academy of Sciences - Advisory Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR Committee), founded in 1972, analyze the effects of radiation exposure on humans on the basis of atomic bomb victims who have been examined and, in some cases, medically monitored for decades. They determine the course of the mortality rate as a function of the age of the radiation victims in comparison with the spontaneous rate, and also the dose-dependency of the number of additional deaths. To date, 26 UNSCEAR reports have been published and are available online, most recently in 2017 on the effects of the Fukushima nuclear accident.\nBy 1949, Americans felt increasingly threatened by the possibility of nuclear war with the Soviet Union and sought ways to survive a nuclear attack. The U.S. Federal Civil Defense Administration (USFCDA) was created by the government to educate the public on how to prepare for such an attack. In 1951, with the help of this agency, a children's educational film was produced in the U.S. called Duck and Cover, in which a turtle demonstrates how to protect oneself from the immediate effects of an atomic bomb explosion by using a coat, tablecloths, or even a newspaper.\nRecognizing that existing medical capacity would not be sufficient in an emergency, dentists were called upon to either assist physicians in an emergency or, if necessary, to provide assistance themselves. To mobilize the profession with the help of a prominent representative, dentist Russell Welford Bunting (1881-1962), dean of the University of Michigan Dental School, was recruited in July 1951 as a dental consultant to the USFCDA.\nThe American physicist Karl Ziegler Morgan (1907-1999) was one of the founders of radiation health physics. In later life, after a long career with the Manhattan Project and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), he became a critic of nuclear power and nuclear weapons production. Morgan was Director of Health Physics at ORNL from the late 1940s until his retirement in 1972. In 1955, he became the first president of the Health Physics Society and served as editor of the journal Health Physics from 1955 to 1977.\nNuclear fallout shelters are designed to protect for an extended period. Due to the nature of nuclear warfare, such shelters must be completely self-sufficient for long periods. In particular, because of the radioactive contamination of the surrounding area, such a facility must be able to survive for several weeks. In 1959, top-secret construction began in Germany on a government bunker in the Ahr valley. In June 1964, 144 test persons survived for six days in a civilian nuclear bunker. The bunker in Dortmund had been built during the Second World War and had been converted at great expense in the early 1960s into a nuclear-weapon-proof building. However, it would be impossible to build a bunker for millions of German citizens. The Swiss Army built about 7800 nuclear fallout shelters in 1964. In the United States in particular, but also Europe, citizens built private fallout shelters in their front yards on their initiative. This construction was largely kept secret because the owners feared that third parties might take possession of the bunker in the event of a crisis.\n\n\n=== Fallout and contamination ===\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb test took place near the town of Alamogordo (New Mexico, USA). As a result of the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests carried out by the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Great Britain, and China, the Earth's atmosphere became increasingly contaminated with fission products from these tests from the 1950s onwards. The radioactive fallout landed on the earth's surface and ended up in plants and, via animal feed, in food of animal origin. Ultimately, they entered the human body and could be detected in bones and teeth as strontium-90, among other things. The radioactivity in the field was measured with a gamma scope, as shown at the air raid equipment exhibition in Bad Godesberg in 1954. Around 180 tests were carried out in 1962 alone. The extent of the radioactive contamination of the food sparked worldwide protests in the early 1960s.\n\nDuring World War II and the Cold War, the Hanford Site produced plutonium for U.S. nuclear weapons for more than 50 years. The plutonium for the first plutonium bomb, Fat Man, also came from there. Hanford is considered the most radioactively contaminated site in the Western Hemisphere. A total of 110,000 tons of nuclear fuel was produced there. In 1948, a radioactive cloud leaked from the plant. The amount of 131I alone was 5500 curies. Most of the reactors at Hanford were shut down in the 1960s, but no disposal or decontamination was done. After preliminary work, the world's largest decontamination operation began at Hanford in 2001 to safely dispose of the radioactive and toxic waste. In 2006, some 11,000 workers were still cleaning up contaminated buildings and soil to reduce radiation levels at the site to acceptable levels. This work is expected to continue until 2052. It is estimated that more than four million liters of radioactive liquid have leaked from storage tanks.\nIt was only after the two superpowers agreed on a Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which allowed only underground nuclear weapons testing, that the level of radioactivity in food began to decline. Shields Warren (1896-1980), one of the authors of a report on the effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, was criticized for downplaying the effects of residual radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but later warned of the dangers of fallout. Fallout refers to the spread of radioactivity in the context of a given meteorological situation. A model experiment was conducted in 2008.\nThe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) is an international alliance of non-governmental organizations committed to the elimination of all nuclear weapons through a binding international treaty - a Nuclear Weapons Convention. ICAN was founded in 2007 by IPPNW (International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) and other organizations at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Conference in Vienna and launched in twelve countries. Today, 468 organizations in 101 countries are involved in the campaign (as of 2017). ICAN was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n=== Radioprotectors ===\nA radioprotector is a pharmacon that, when administered, selectively protects healthy cells from the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. The first work with radioprotectors began as part of the Manhattan Project, a military research project to develop and build an atomic bomb.\n\nIodine absorbed by the body is almost completely stored in the thyroid gland and has a biological half-life of about 120 days. If the iodine is radioactive (131I), it can irradiate and damage the thyroid gland in high doses during this time. Because the thyroid gland can only absorb a limited amount of iodine, prophylactic administration of non-radioactive iodine may result in iodine blockade. Potassium iodide in tablet form (colloquially known as \"iodine tablets\") reduces the uptake of radioactive iodine into the thyroid by a factor of 90 or more, thus acting as a radioprotector. All other radiation damage remains unaffected by taking iodine tablets. In Germany, the Potassium Iodide Ordinance (KIV) was enacted in 2003 to ensure \"the supply of the population with potassium iodide-containing medicines in the event of radiological incidents\".\n\n§ 1\nkiv (in German)\nPotassium iodide is usually stored in communities near nuclear facilities for distribution to the population in the event of a disaster. People over the age of 45 should not take iodine tablets because the risk of side effects is higher than the risk of developing thyroid cancer. In Switzerland, as a precautionary measure, tablets have been distributed every five years since 2004 to the population living within 20 km of nuclear power plants (from 2014, 50 km). In Austria, large stocks of iodine tablets have been kept in pharmacies, kindergartens, schools, the army and the federal reserve since 2002.\nThanks to the protective function of radioprotectors, the dose of radiation used to treat malignant tumors (cancer) can be increased, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the therapy. There are also radiosensitizers, which increase the sensitivity of malignant tumor cells to ionizing radiation. As early as 1921, the German radiologist Hermann Holthusen (1886-1971) described that oxygen increases the sensitivity of cells.\n\n\n=== Nuclear accidents and catastrophes ===\n\nFounded in 1957 as a sub-organization of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) pools the scientific and financial resources of participating countries' nuclear research programs. It operates various databases and also manages the International Reporting System for Operating Experience (IRS or IAEA/NEA Incident Reporting System) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA records and investigates radiation accidents that have occurred worldwide in connection with nuclear medical procedures and the disposal of related materials.\nThe International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) is a scale for safety-related events, in particular nuclear incidents and accidents in nuclear facilities. It was developed by an international group of experts and officially adopted in 1990 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The purpose of the scale is to inform the public quickly about the safety significance of an event by means of a comprehensible classification of events.\nAt the end of its useful life, the proper disposal of the remaining high activity is of paramount importance. Improper disposal of the radionuclide cobalt-60, used in cobalt guns for radiotherapy, has led to serious radiation accidents, such as the Ciudad Juárez (Mexico) radiological accident in 1983/84, the Goiânia (Brazil) accident in 1987, the Samut Prakan (Thailand) nuclear accident in 2000, and the Mayapuri (India) accident in 2010.\nEleven Therac-25 linear accelerators were built by the Canadian company Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) between 1982 and 1985 and installed in clinics in the United States and Canada. Software errors and a lack of quality assurance led to a serious malfunction that killed three patients and seriously injured three others between June 1985 and 1987 before appropriate countermeasures were taken. The radiation exposure in the six cases was subsequently estimated to be between 40 and 200 Gray; normal treatment is equivalent to a dose of less than 2 Gray.\nAround 1990, about one hundred cobalt guns were still in use in Germany. In the meantime, electron linear accelerators were introduced and the last cobalt gun was decommissioned in 2000.\n\nThe Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 reinforced the need for proper safety management and the derivation of safety indicators regarding the frequency of errors and incorrect actions by personnel, i.e., the human factor. The Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan (Japanese: 原子力安全委員会) was a body of scientists that advised the Japanese government on nuclear safety issues. The commission was established in 1978, but was dissolved after the Fukushima nuclear disaster on September 19, 2012, and replaced by the Genshiryoku Kisei Iinkai (Japanese: 原子力規制委員会, lit. 'Nuclear Regulatory Committee'). It is an independent agency (gaikyoku, \"external office\") of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment that regulates and monitors the safety of Japan's nuclear power plants and related facilities.\nAs a result of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, the IAEA coined the term \"safety culture\" for the first time in 1991 to draw attention to the importance of human and organizational issues for the safe operation of nuclear power plants.\nAfter this nuclear disaster, the sand in children's playgrounds in Germany was removed and replaced with uncontaminated sand to protect children who were most vulnerable to radioactivity. Some families temporarily left Germany to escape the fallout. Infant mortality increased significantly by 5% in 1987, the year after Chernobyl. In total, 316 more newborns died that year than statistically expected. In Germany, the caesium137 inventories from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in soil and food decrease by 2-3% each year; however, the contamination of game and mushrooms was still comparatively high in 2015, especially in Bavaria; there are several cases of game meat, especially wild boar, exceeding the limits. However, controls are insufficient.\n\n\"In particular, wild boars in southern Bavaria are repeatedly found to have a very high radioactive contamination of over 10,000 Becquerel/kg. The limit is 600 Becquerel/kg. For this reason, the Bavarian Consumer Center advises against eating wild boar from the Bavarian Forest and south of the Danube too often. Whoever buys wild boar from a hunter, should ask for the measurement protocol.\"\n\n\n=== Ocean dumping of radioactive waste ===\nBetween 1969 and 1982, conditioned low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste was disposed of in the Atlantic Ocean at a depth of about 4,000 meters under the supervision of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste of All Kinds (London Dumping Convention of June 11, 1974). This was carried out jointly by several European countries. Since 1993, international treaties have prohibited the dumping of radioactive waste in the oceans. For decades, this dumping of nuclear waste went largely unnoticed by the public until Greenpeace denounced it in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Repository for heat-generating radioactive waste ===\n\nSince the commissioning of the first commercial nuclear power plants (USA 1956, Germany 1962), various final storage concepts for radioactive materials have been proposed in the following decades, of which only storage in deep geological formations appeared to be safe and feasible within a reasonable period of time and was pursued further. Due to the high activity of the short-lived fission products, spent fuel is initially handled only under water and stored for several years in a decay pool. The water is used for cooling and also shields much of the emitted radiation. This is followed either by reprocessing or by decades of interim storage. Waste from reprocessing must also be stored temporarily until the heat has decreased enough to allow final disposal. Casks are special containers for the storage and transport of highly radioactive materials. Their maximum permissible dose rate is 0.35 mSv/h, of which a maximum of 0.25 mSv/h is due to neutron radiation. The safety of these transport containers has been discussed every three years since 1980 at the International Symposium on the Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Materials (PATRAM).\nFollowing various experiments, such as the Gorleben exploratory mine or the Asse mine, a working group on the selection procedure for repository sites (AkEnd) developed recommendations for a new selection procedure for repository sites between 1999 and 2002. In Germany, the Site Selection Act was passed in 2013 and the Act on the Further Development of the Site Search was passed on March 23, 2017. A suitable site is to be sought throughout Germany and identified by 2031. In principle, crystalline (granite), salt or clay rock types can be considered for a repository. There will be no \"ideal\" site. The \"best possible\" site will be sought. Mining areas and regions where volcanoes have been active or where there is a risk of earthquakes are excluded. Internationally, experts are advocating storage in rock formations several hundred meters below the earth's surface. This involves building a repository mine and storing the waste there. It is then permanently sealed. Geological and technical barriers surrounding the waste are designed to keep it safe for thousands of years. For example, 300 meters of rock will separate the repository from the earth's surface. It will be surrounded by a 100-meter-thick layer of granite, salt or clay. The first waste is not expected to be stored until 2050.\nThe Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BfE) took up its activities on September 1, 2004. Its remit includes tasks relating to nuclear safety, the safety of nuclear waste management, the site selection procedure including research activities in these areas and, later on, further tasks in the area of licensing and supervision of repositories.\nIn the USA, Yucca Mountain was initially selected as the final storage site, but this project was temporarily halted in February 2009. Yucca Mountain was the starting point for an investigation into atomic semiotics.\n\n\n=== Atomic semiotics ===\n\nThe operation of nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities produces radioactive materials that can have lethal health effects for thousands of years. It is important to note that there is no institution capable of maintaining the necessary knowledge of the dangers over such periods, and of ensuring that warnings about the dangers of nuclear waste in nuclear repositories will be understood by posterity in the distant future. A few years ago, even the capsules of the radionuclide cobalt-60, which were appropriately labeled, went unnoticed. Improper disposal led to the opening of these capsules, resulting in fatal consequences. The dimensions of time exceed previous human standards. For instance, cuneiform writing, which is only about 5000 years old (about 150 human generations), can only be understood after a long period of research and by experts. In 1981, research into the development of atomic semiotics began in the USA, in the German-speaking world, Roland Posner (1942-2020) of the Center for Semiotics at the Technical University of Berlin worked on this in 1982/83. In the USA, the time horizon for such warning signs was set at 10,000 years; later, as in Germany, it was set at a period of one million years, which would correspond to about 30,000 (human) generations. To date, no satisfactory solution to this problem has been found.\n\n\n== Radiation protection during flights ==\n\n\n=== High-altitude radiation ===\nIn 1912, Victor Franz Hess (1883-1964) discovered (secondary) cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere using balloon flights. For this discovery he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. He was also one of the \"martyrs\" of early radiation research and had to undergo a thumb amputation and larynx surgery due to radium burns. In the United States and the Soviet Union, balloon flights to altitudes of about 30 km, followed by parachute jumps from the stratosphere, were conducted before 1960 to study human exposure to cosmic radiation in space. The American Manhigh and Excelsior projects with Joseph Kittinger (1928-2022) became particularly well known, but the Soviet parachutist Yevgeny Andreyev (1926-2000) also set new records.\n\nHigh-energy radiation from space is much stronger at high altitudes than at sea level. The radiation exposure of flight crews and air travelers is therefore increased. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has issued recommendations for dose limits, which were incorporated into European law in 1996 and into the German Radiation Protection Ordinance in 2001. Radiation exposure is particularly high when flying in the polar regions or over the polar route. The average annual effective dose for aviation personnel was 1.9 mSv in 2015 and 2.0 mSv in 2016. The highest annual personal dose was 5.7 mSv in 2015 and 6.0 mSv in 2016. The collective dose for 2015 was about 76 person-Sv. This means that flight personnel are among the occupational groups in Germany with the highest radiation exposure in terms of collective dose and average annual dose. This group also includes frequent flyers, with Thomas Stuker holding the \"record\" - also in terms of radiation exposure - by reaching the 10 million mile mark with United Airlines MileagePlus on 5,900 flights between 1982 and the summer of 2011. In 2017, he passed the 18 million mile mark.\nThe program EPCARD (European Program Package for the Calculation of Aviation Route Dose) was developed at the University of Siegen and the Helmholtz Munich and can be used to calculate the dose from all components of natural penetrating cosmic radiation on any flight route and flight profile - also online.\n\n\n=== Radiation protection in space ===\n\nFrom the earliest manned space flights to the first moon landing and the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), radiation protection has been a major concern. Spacesuits used for extravehicular activities are coated on the outside with aluminum, which largely protects against cosmic radiation. The largest international research project to determine the effective dose or effective dose equivalent was the Matryoshka experiment in 2010, named after the Russian Matryoshka dolls, because it uses a human-sized phantom that can be cut into slices. As part of Matroshka, an anthropomorphic phantom was exposed to the outside of the space station for the first time to simulate an astronaut performing an extravehicular activity (spacewalk) and determine their exposure to radiation. Microelectronics on satellites must also be protected from radiation.\n\nJapanese scientists from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) have discovered a huge cave on the moon with their Kaguya lunar probe, which could offer astronauts protection from dangerous radiation during future lunar landings, especially during the planned stopover of a Mars mission.\nAs part of a human mission to Mars, astronauts must be protected from cosmic radiation. During Curiosity's mission to Mars, a Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was used to measure radiation exposure. The radiation exposure of 1.8 millisieverts per day was mainly due to the constant presence of high-energy galactic particle radiation. In contrast, radiation from the sun accounted for only about three to five percent of the radiation levels measured during Curiosity's flight to Mars. On the way to Mars, the RAD instrument detected a total of five major radiation events caused by solar flares. To protect the astronauts, a plasma bubble will surround the spacecraft as an energy shield and its magnetic field will protect the crew from cosmic radiation. This would eliminate the need for conventional radiation shields, which are several centimeters thick and correspondingly heavy. In the Space Radiation Superconducting Shield (SR2S) project, which was completed in December 2015, magnesium diboride was found to be a suitable material for generating a suitable force field.\n\n\n== Development of metrological principles of radiation protection ==\n\n\n=== Dosimeter ===\nDosimeters are instruments used to measure radiation dose - as absorbed dose or dose equivalent - and are an important cornerstone of radiation protection.\n\n\n==== Film dosimeter ====\n\nAt the October 1907 meeting of the American Roentgen Ray Society, Rome Vernon Wagner, an X-ray tube manufacturer, reported that he had begun carrying a photographic plate in his pocket and developing it every evening. This allowed him to determine how much radiation he had been exposed to. This was the forerunner of the film dosimeter. His efforts came too late, as he had already developed cancer and died six months after the conference.\nIn the 1920s, the physical chemist John Eggert (1891-1973) played a key role in the introduction of film dosimetry for routine personal monitoring. Since then, it has been successively improved and, in particular, the evaluation technique has been automated since the 1960s. At the same time, Hermann Joseph Muller (1890-1967) discovered mutations as genetic consequences of X-rays, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1946. At the same time, the roentgen (R) was introduced as a unit for quantitative measurement of radiation exposure.\nA dosimeter for film is divided into multiple segments, each containing a light- or radiation-sensitive film surrounded by layers of copper and lead with varying thickness. The degree of radiation penetration determines whether the segment is not blackened or blackened to varying degrees. The absorbed radiation effect during the measurement time is summed up, and the radiation dose can be determined from the blackening. Guidelines for evaluation exist, with those for Germany being published in 1994 and last updated on December 8, 2003.\n\n\n==== Particle and quantum detectors ====\n\nWith the invention of the Geiger gaseous ionization detector in 1913, which became the Geiger-Müller gaseous ionization detector in 1928 - named after the physicists Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Walther Müller (1905-1979) - the individual particles or quanta of ionizing radiation could be detected and measured. Detectors developed later, such as proportional counters or scintillation counters, which not only \"count\" but also measure energy and distinguish between types of radiation, also became important for radiation protection. Scintillation measurement is one of the oldest methods of detecting ionizing radiation or X-rays; originally, a zinc sulfide screen was held in the path of the beam and the scintillation events were either counted as flashes or, in the case of X-ray diagnostics, viewed as an image. A scintillation counter known as a spinthariscope was developed in 1903 by William Crookes (1832-1919) and used by Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) to study the scattering of alpha particles from atomic nuclei.\n\n\n==== Thermoluminescence dosimeter ====\n\nLithium fluoride had already been proposed in the USA in 1950 by Farrington Daniels (1889-1972), Charles A. Boyd and Donald F. Saunders (1924-2013) for solid-state dosimetry using thermoluminescent dosimeters. The intensity of the thermoluminescent light is proportional to the amount of radiation previously absorbed. This type of dosimetry has been used since 1953 in the treatment of cancer patients and wherever people are occupationally exposed to radiation. The thermoluminescence dosimeter was followed by OSL dosimetry, which is not based on heat but on optically stimulated luminescence and was developed by Zenobia Jacobs and Richard Roberts at the University of Wollongong (Australia). The detector emits the stored energy as light. The light output, measured with photomultipliers, is then a measure of the dose.\n\n\n=== Whole body counter ===\nSince 2003, whole-body counters have been used in radiation protection to monitor the absorption (incorporation) of radionuclides in people who handle gamma-emitting open radioactive materials and who may be contaminated through food, inhalation of dusts and gases, or open wounds. (α and β emitters are not measurable).\n\n\n=== Test specimen ===\n\nConstancy testing is the verification of reference values as part of quality assurance in x-ray diagnostics, nuclear medicine diagnostics, and radiotherapy. National regulations specify which parameters are to be tested, which limits are to be observed, which test methods are to be used, and which test samples are to be used. In Germany, the Radiation Protection in Medicine Directive and the relevant DIN 6855 standard in nuclear medicine require regular (in some cases daily) constancy testing. Test sources are used to check the response of probe measuring stations as well as in vivo and in vitro measuring stations. Before starting the tests, the background count rate and the setting of the energy window must be checked every working day, and the settings and the yield with reproducible geometry must be checked at least once a week with a suitable test source, e.g. 137Caesium (DIN 6855-1). The reference values for the constancy test are determined during the acceptance test.\nCompact test specimens for medical X-ray images were not created until 1982. Prior to this, the patient himself often served as the object for producing X-ray test images. Prototypes of such an X-ray phantom with integrated structures were developed by Thomas Bronder at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt.\nA water phantom is a Plexiglas container filled with distilled water that is used as a substitute for living tissue to test electron linear accelerators used in radiation therapy. According to regulatory requirements, water phantom testing must be performed approximately every three months to ensure that the radiation dose delivered by the treatment system is consistent with the radiation planning.\nThe Alderson-Rando phantom, invented by Samuel W. Alderson (1914-2005), has become the standard X-ray phantom. It was followed by the Alderson Radio Therapy (ART) phantom, which he patented in 1967. The ART phantom is cut horizontally into 2.5 cm thick slices. Each slice has holes sealed with bone-equivalent, soft-tissue-equivalent, or lung-equivalent pins that can be replaced by thermoluminescent dosimeters. Alderson is also known as the inventor of the crash test dummy.\n\n\n=== Dose reconstruction with ESR spectroscopy of deciduous teeth ===\nAs a result of accidents or improper use and disposal of radiation sources, a significant number of people are exposed to varying degrees of radiation. Radioactivity and local dose measurements are not sufficient to fully assess the effects of radiation. To retrospectively determine the individual radiation dose, measurements are made on teeth, i.e. on biological, endogenous materials. Tooth enamel is particularly suitable for the detection of ionizing radiation due to its high mineral content (hydroxyapatite), which has been known since 1968 thanks to the research of John M. Brady, Norman O. Aarestad and Harold M. Swartz. The measurements are performed on milk teeth, preferably molars, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (ESR, EPR). The concentration of radicals generated by ionizing radiation is measured in the mineral part of the tooth. Due to the high stability of the radicals, this method can be used for dosimetry of long past exposures.\n\n\n=== Dose reconstruction using biological dosimetry ===\nSince about 1988, in addition to physical dosimetry, biological dosimetry has made it possible to reconstruct the individual dose of ionizing radiation. This is especially important for unforeseen and accidental exposures, where radiation exposures occur without physical dose monitoring. Biological markers, particularly cytogenetic markers in blood lymphocytes, are used for this purpose. Techniques for detecting radiation damage include analyzing dicentric chromosomes after acute radiation exposure. Dicentric chromosomes result from defective repair of chromosome breaks in two chromosomes, resulting in two centromeres instead of one like undamaged chromosomes. Symmetric translocations, detected through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are used after chronic or long-term exposure to radiation. The micronucleus test and the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) test are available to measure acute exposure.\n\n\n== Measured variables and units ==\nIn principle, reducing the exposure of the human organism to ionizing radiation to zero is not possible and perhaps not even sensible. The human organism has been accustomed to natural radioactivity for thousands of years and ultimately this also triggers mutations (changes in genetic material), which are the cause of the development of life on earth. The mutation-inducing effect of high-energy radiation was first demonstrated in 1927 by Hermann Joseph Muller (1890-1967).\nThree years after its establishment in 1958, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation adopted the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model - a linear dose-effect relationship without a threshold - largely at the instigation of the Soviet Union. The dose-response relationship measured at high doses was extrapolated linearly to low doses. There would be no threshold, since even the smallest amounts of ionizing radiation would trigger some biological effect. The LNT model ignores not only possible radiation hormesis, but also the known ability of cells to repair genetic damage and the ability of the organism to remove damaged cells. Between 1963 and 1969, John W. Gofman (1918-2007) and Arthur R. Tamplin of the University of California, Berkeley, conducted research for the United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC, 1946-1974) investigating the relationship between radiation doses and cancer incidence. Their findings sparked a fierce controversy in the United States beginning in 1969. Starting in 1970, Ernest J. Sternglass, a radiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, published several studies describing the effect of radiation from nuclear tests and the vicinity of nuclear power plants on infant mortality. In 1971, the UASEC reduced the maximum allowable radiation dose by a factor of 100. Subsequently, nuclear technology was based on the principle of \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA). This was a coherent principle as long as it was assumed that there was no threshold and that all doses were additive. In the meantime, a transition to \"As High As Reasonably Safe\" (AHARS) is increasingly being discussed. For the question of evacuation after accidents, a transition to AHARS seems absolutely necessary. In both the Chernobyl and Fukushima cases, hasty, poorly organized and poorly communicated evacuations caused psychological and physical damage to those affected - including documented deaths in the case of Fukushima. By some estimates, this damage is greater than would have been expected had the evacuation not taken place. Voices such as Geraldine Thomas therefore question such evacuations in principle and call for a transition to shelter-in-place wherever possible.\n\n\n=== Absorbed dose and dose equivalent ===\nThe British physicist and radiologist and founder of radiobiology Louis Harold Gray (1905-1965) introduced the unit Rad (acronym for radiation absorbed dose) in the 1930s, which was renamed Gray (Gy) after him in 1978. One gray is a mass-specific quantity and corresponds to the energy of one joule absorbed by one kilogram of body weight. Acute whole-body exposures in excess of four Gy are usually fatal to humans.\nThe different types of radiation ionize to different degrees. Ionization is any process in which one or more electrons are removed from an atom or molecule, leaving the atom or molecule as a positively charged ion (cation). Each type of radiation is therefore assigned a dimensionless weighting factor that expresses its biological effectiveness. For X-rays, gamma and beta radiation, the factor is one, alpha radiation reaches a factor of twenty, and for neutron radiation it is between five and twenty, depending on the energy.\nMultiplying the absorbed dose in Gy by the weighting factor gives the equivalent dose, expressed in Sievert (Sv). It is named after the Swedish physician and physicist Rolf Maximilian Sievert (1896-1966). Sievert was the founder of radiation protection research and developed the Sievert chamber in 1929 to measure the intensity of X-rays. He founded the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and later became chairman of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The ICRU and ICRP specify differently defined weighting factors that apply to environmental measurements (quality factor) and body-related dose equivalent data (radiation weighting factor).\nIn relation to the body, the relevant dose term is the Organ Equivalent Dose (formerly \"Organ Dose\"). This is the dose equivalent averaged over an organ. Multiplied by organ-specific tissue weighting factors and summed over all organs, the effective dose is obtained, which represents a dose balance. In relation to environmental measurements, the ambient dose equivalent or local dose is relevant. Its increase over time is called the local dose rate.\nEven at very low effective doses, stochastic effects (genetic and cancer risk) are expected. At effective doses above 0.1 Sv, deterministic effects also occur (tissue damage up to radiation sickness at very high doses). Correspondingly high radiation doses are now only given in units of Gy. Natural radiation exposure in Germany, with an annual average effective dose of about 0.002 Sv, is well below this range.\n\n\n=== Tolerance dose ===\nIn 1931, the U.S. Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection (ACXRP, now the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, NCRP), founded in 1929, published the results of a study on the so-called tolerance dose, on which a scientifically based radiation protection guideline was based. Exposure limits were gradually lowered. In 1936 the tolerance dose was 0.1 R/day. The unit \"R\" (the X-ray) from the CGS unit system has been obsolete since the end of 1985. Since then, the SI unit of ion dose has been \"coulomb per kilogram\".\n\n\n=== Relative biological effectiveness ===\nAfter World War II, the concept of tolerance dose was replaced by that of maximum permissible dose and the concept of relative biological effectiveness was introduced. The limit was set in 1956 by the National Council on Radiation Protection & Measurements (NCRP) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) at 5 rem (50 mSv) per year for radiation workers and 0.5 rem per year for the general population. The unit Rem as a physical measure of radiation dose (from the English roentgen equivalent in man) was replaced by the unit Sv (sievert) in 1978. This was due to the advent of nuclear energy and its associated dangers. Prior to 1991, the equivalent dose was used both as a measure of dose and as a term for the body dose that determines the course and survival of radiation sickness. ICRP Publication 60 introduced the radiation weighting factor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            R\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{R}}\n  \n was introduced. For examples of equivalent doses as body doses, see\n\nOrder of magnitude of the dose equivalent\nOrder of magnitude of the local dose rate.\n\n\n=== Banana equivalent dose ===\nThe origin of the concept of using a banana equivalent dose (BED) as a benchmark is unknown. In 1995, Gary Mansfield of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory found the Banana Equivalent Dose (BED) to be very useful in explaining radiation risks to the public. It is not a formally used dose.\nThe banana equivalent dose is the dose of ionizing radiation to which a person is exposed by eating one banana. Bananas contain potassium. Natural potassium consists of 0.0117% of the radioactive isotope 40K (potassium-40) and has a specific activity of 30,346 becquerels per kilogram, or about 30 becquerels per gram. The radiation dose from eating a banana is about 0.1 μSv. The value of this reference dose is given as \"1\" and thus becomes the \"unit of measurement\" banana equivalent dose. Consequently, other radiation exposures can be compared to the consumption of one banana. For example, the average daily total radiation exposure of a person is 100 banana equivalent doses.\nAt 0.17 mSv per year, almost 10 percent of natural radioactive exposure in Germany (an average of 2.1 mSv per year) is caused by the body's own (vital) potassium.\nThe banana equivalent dose does not take into account the fact that no radioactive nuclide is accumulated in the body through the consumption of potassium-containing foods. The potassium content of the body is in homeostasis and is kept constant.\n\n\n== Disregard of radiation protection ==\n\n\n=== Unethical radiation experiments ===\n\nThe Trinity test was the first nuclear weapon explosion conducted as part of the US Manhattan Project. There were no warnings to residents about the fallout, nor information about shelters or possible evacuations.\nThis was followed in 1946 by tests in the Marshall Islands (Operation Crossroads), as recounted by chemist Harold Carpenter Hodge (1904-1990), toxicologist for the Manhattan Project, in his lecture (1947) as president of the International Association for Dental Research. Hodge's reputation was severely damaged by historian Eileen Welsome's 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Plutonium Files - America's Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War. She documents horrific human experiments in which the subjects (including Hodge) were unaware that they were being used as \"guinea pigs\" to test the safety limits of uranium and plutonium. The experiments on the unidentified subjects were continued by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) into the 1970s.\nThe abuse of radiation continues to this day. During the Cold War, ethically reprehensible radiation experiments were conducted in the United States on untrained human subjects to determine the detailed effects of radiation on human health. Between 1945 and 1947, 18 people were injected with plutonium by Manhattan Project doctors. In Nashville, pregnant women were given radioactive mixtures. In Cincinnati, about 200 patients were irradiated over a 15-year period. In Chicago, 102 people received injections of strontium and caesium solutions. In Massachusetts, 57 children with developmental disorders were given oatmeal with radioactive markers. These radiation experiments were not stopped until 1993 under President Bill Clinton. But the injustice committed was not atoned for. For years, uranium hexafluoride caused radiation damage at a DuPont Company plant and to local residents. At times, the plant even deliberately released uranium hexafluoride in its heated gaseous state into the surrounding area to study the effects of the radioactive and chemically aggressive gas.\n\n\n=== Stasi border controls ===\nBetween 1978 and 1989, vehicles were checked with 137Cs gamma sources at 17 border crossings between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. According to the Transit Agreement, vehicles could only be screened if there was reasonable suspicion. For this reason, the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) installed and operated a secret radioactive screening technology, codenamed \"Technik V,\" which was generally used to screen all transit passengers to detect \"deserters from the Republic.\" Ordinary GDR customs officers were unaware of the secret radioactive screening technology and were subject to strict \"entry regulations\" designed to \"protect\" them as much as possible from radiation exposure. Lieutenant General Heinz Fiedler (1929-1993), as the highest ranking border guard of the MfS, was responsible for all radiation controls. On February 17, 1995, the Radiation Protection Commission published a statement in which it said: \"Even if we assume that individual persons stopped more frequently in the radiation field and that a fluoroscopy lasting up to three minutes increases the annual radiation exposure by one to a few mSv, this does not result in a dose that is harmful to health\". In contrast, the designer of this type of border control calculated 15 nSv per crossing. Lorenz of the former State Office for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety of the GDR came up with a dose estimate of 1000 nSv, which was corrected to 50 nSv a few weeks later.\n\n\n=== Radar systems ===\n\nRadar equipment is used at airports, in airplanes, at missile sites, on tanks, and on ships. The radar technology commonly used in the 20th century produced X-rays as a technically unavoidable by-product in the high-voltage electronics of the equipment. In the 1960s and 1970s, German soldiers and technicians were largely unaware of the dangers, as were those in the GDR's National People's Army. The problem had been known internationally since the 1950s, and to the German Armed Forces since at least 1958. However, no radiation protection measures were taken, such as the wearing of lead aprons. Until about the mid-1980s, radiation shielding was inadequate, especially for pulse switch tubes. Particularly affected were maintenance technicians (radar mechanics) who were exposed to the X-ray generating parts for hours without any protection. The permissible annual limit value could be exceeded after just 3 minutes. It was not until 1976 that warning notices were put up and protective measures taken in the German Navy, and not until the early 1980s in general. As late as the 1990s, the German Armed Forces denied any connection between radar equipment and cancer or genetic damage. The number of victims amounted to several thousand. The connection was later acknowledged by the German Armed Forces and in many cases a supplementary pension was paid. In 2012, a foundation was set up to provide unbureaucratic compensation for the victims.\n\n\n== Radiation protection crimes ==\n\n\n=== National Socialism ===\nThe harmful effects of X-rays were recognized during the National Socialist era. The function of the gonads (ovaries or testicles) was destroyed by ionizing radiation, leading to infertility. In July 1942, Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) decided to conduct forced sterilization experiments at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, which were carried out by Horst Schumann (1906-1983), previously a doctor in Aktion T4. Each test victim had to stand between two X-ray machines, which were arranged in such a way that the test victim had just enough space between them. Opposite the x-ray machines was a booth with lead walls and a small window. From the booth, Schumann could direct X-rays at the test victims' sexual organs without endangering himself.  Human radiation castration experiments were also conducted in concentration camps under the direction of Viktor Brack (1904-1948). As part of the \"Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases,\" people were often subjected to radiation castration during interrogations without their knowledge. Approximately 150 radiologists from hospitals throughout Germany participated in the forced castration of approximately 7,200 people using X-rays or radium.\n\n\n=== Polonium murder ===\nOn November 23, 2006, Alexander Alexanderovich Litvinenko (1962-2006) was murdered under unexplained circumstances as a result of radiation sickness caused by polonium. This was also briefly suspected in the case of Yasser Arafat (1929-2004), who died in 2004.\n\n\n=== Radiation offenses ===\nThe misuse of ionizing radiation is a radiation offence under German criminal law. The use of ionizing radiation to harm persons or property is punishable. Since 1998, the regulations can be found in\n\n§ 309\nStGB (in German)\n(previously § 311a StGB old version); the regulations go back to § 41 AtG old version. In the Austrian Criminal Code, relevant criminal offenses are defined in the seventh section, \"Criminal acts dangerous to the public\" and \"Criminal acts against the environment\". In Switzerland, endangerment by nuclear energy, radioactive substances or ionizing radiation is punishable under Art. 326 of the Swiss Criminal Code and disregard of safety regulations under Chapter 9 of the Nuclear Energy Act of 21 March 2003.\n\n\n== Radiation protection for less energetic types of radiation ==\n\nOriginally, the term radiation protection referred only to ionizing radiation. Today, non-ionizing radiation is also included and is the responsibility of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, the Radiation Protection Division of the Federal Office of Public Health and the Ministry of Climate Action and Energy (Austria). The project collected, evaluated and compared data on the legal situation in all European countries (47 countries plus Germany) and major non-European countries (China, India, Australia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) regarding electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF) and optical radiation (OS). The results were very different and in some cases deviated from the recommendations of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).\n\n\n=== UV light ===\n\nFor many centuries, the Inuit (Eskimos) have used snow goggles with narrow slits, carved from seal bones or reindeer antlers, to protect against snow blindness (photokeratitis).\n\nIn the 1960s, Australia - particularly Queensland - launched the first awareness campaign on the dangers of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the spirit of primary prevention. In the 1980s, many countries in Europe and overseas initiated similar UV protection campaigns. UV radiation has a thermal effect on the skin and eyes and can lead to skin cancer (malignant melanoma) and eye inflammation or cataracts. To protect the skin from harmful UV radiation, such as photodermatosis, acne aestivalis, actinic keratosis or urticaria solaris, normal clothing, special UV protective clothing (SPF 40-50) and high SPF sunscreen can be used. The Australian-New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 4399) of 1996 measures new textile materials in an unstretched and dry state for the manufacture of protective clothing worn while bathing, especially by children, and for the manufacture of shading textiles (sunshades, awnings). The UV Standard 801 assumes a maximum radiation intensity with the solar spectrum in Melbourne, Australia, on January 1 of a year (at the height of the Australian summer), the most sensitive skin type of the wearer, and under wearing conditions. As the solar spectrum in the northern hemisphere differs from that in Australia, the measurement method according to the European standard EN 13758-1 is based on the solar spectrum of Albuquerque (New Mexico, USA), which corresponds approximately to that of southern Europe.\nTo protect your eyes, wear sunglasses with UV protection or special goggles that also shield the sides to prevent snow blindness. A defensive reaction of the skin is the formation of a light callus, the skin's own sun protection, which corresponds to a protection factor of about 5. At the same time, the production of brown skin pigments (melanin) in the corresponding cells (melanocytes) is stimulated.\nA solar control film is usually a film made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that is applied to windows to reduce the light and heat from the sun's rays. The film filters UV-A and UV-B radiation. Polyethylene terephthalate goes back to an invention by the two Englishmen John Rex Whinfield (1902-1966) and James Tennant Dickson in 1941.\n\nThe fact that UV-B radiation (Dorno radiation, after Carl Dorno (1865-1942)) is a proven carcinogen, but is also required for the body's own synthesis of vitamin-D3 (cholecalciferol), leads to internationally conflicting recommendations regarding health-promoting UV exposure. In 2014, based on the scientific evidence of the last decades, 20 scientific authorities, professional societies and associations from the fields of radiation protection, health, risk assessment, medicine and nutrition published a recommendation on \"UV exposure for the formation of the body's own vitamin D\". It was the first interdisciplinary recommendation on this topic worldwide. Using a solarium for the first time at a young age (<35 years) almost doubles the risk of developing malignant melanoma. In Germany, the use of tanning beds by minors has been prohibited by law since March 2010. As of August 1, 2012, sunbeds must not exceed a maximum irradiance of 0.3 watts per square meter of skin. Sunbeds must be labeled accordingly. The new irradiance limit corresponds to the highest UV dose that can be measured on Earth at 12 noon under a cloudless sky at the equator.\nThe minimum erythema dose (MED) is determined for medical applications. The MED is defined as the lowest dose of radiation that produces a barely visible erythema. It is determined 24 hours after the test irradiation. It is performed with the type of lamp intended for the therapy by applying so-called light stairs to skin that is not normally exposed to light (for example, on the buttocks).\n\n\n=== Sun lamp ===\n\nRichard Küch (1860-1915) was able to melt quartz glass - the basis for UV radiation sources - for the first time in 1890 and founded the Heraeus Quarzschmelze. He developed the first quartz lamp (sun lamp) for generating UV radiation in 1904, thus laying the foundation for this form of light therapy.\nDespite the dosage problems, doctors increasingly used quartz lamps in the early 20th century. Internal medicine specialists and dermatologists were among the most eager testers. After successful treatment of skin tuberculosis, internal medicine began to treat tuberculous pleurisy, glandular tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis. In addition, doctors tested the effect of quartz lamps on other infectious diseases such as syphilis, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, nerve pain such as sciatica, or nervous diseases such as neurasthenia and hysteria. In dermatology, fungal diseases, ulcers and wounds, psoriasis, acne, freckles and hair loss were also treated with quartz lamps, while in gynecology, abdominal diseases were treated with quartz lamps. Rejuvenation specialists used artificial high-altitude sunlight to stimulate gonadal activity and treated infertility, impotentia generandi (inability to conceive), and lack of sexual desire by irradiating the genitals. For this purpose, Philipp Keller (1891-1973) developed an erythema dosimeter with which he measured the amount of radiation not in Finsen units (UV radiation with a wavelength λ of 296.7 nm and an irradiance E of 10−5 W/m²), but in height solar units (HSE). It was the only instrument in use around 1930, but it was not widely accepted in medical circles.\nTreatment of acne with ultraviolet radiation is still controversial. Although UV radiation can have an antibacterial effect, it can also induce proliferative hyperkeratosis. This can lead to the formation of comedones (\"blackheads\"). Phototoxic effects may also occur. In addition, it is carcinogenic and promotes skin aging. UV therapy is increasingly being abandoned in favor of photodynamic therapy.\n\n\n=== Laser ===\n\nThe ruby laser was developed in 1960 by Theodore Maiman (1927-2007) as the first laser based on the ruby maser. Soon after, the dangers of lasers were discovered, especially for the eyes and skin, due to the laser's low penetration depth. Lasers have numerous applications in technology and research as well as in everyday life, from simple laser pointers to distance measuring devices, cutting and welding tools, reproduction of optical storage media such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, communication, laser scalpels and other devices using laser light in everyday medical practice. The Radiation Protection Commission requires that laser applications on human skin be performed only by a specially trained physician. Lasers are also used for show effects in discotheques and at events.\n\nLasers can cause biological damage due to the properties of their radiation and their sometimes extremely concentrated electromagnetic power. For this reason, lasers must be labeled with standardized warnings depending on the laser class. The classification is based on the DIN standard EN 60825-1, which distinguishes between ranges of wavelengths and exposure times that lead to characteristic injuries and injury thresholds for power or energy density.\nThe CO2-Laser was developed in 1964 by the Indian electrical engineer and physicist Chandra Kumar Naranbhai Patel (*1938) at the same time as the Nd:YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser) at Bell Laboratories by LeGrand Van Uitert (1922-1999) and Joseph E. Geusic (*1931) and the Er:YAG laser (erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser) and has been used in dentistry since the early 1970s. In the hard laser field, two systems in particular are emerging for use in the oral cavity: the CO2 laser for use in soft tissue and the Er:YAG laser for use in dental hard and soft tissue. The goal of soft laser treatment is to achieve biostimulation with low energy densities.\nThe Commission on Radiological Protection strongly recommends that the possession and purchase of class 3B and 4 laser pointers be regulated by law to prevent misuse. This is due to the increase in dangerous dazzle attacks caused by high-power laser pointers. In addition to pilots, these include truck and car drivers, train operators, soccer players, referees, and even spectators at soccer games. Such glare can lead to serious accidents and, in the case of pilots and truck drivers, to occupational disability due to eye damage. The first accident prevention regulation was published on April 1, 1988 as BGV B2, followed on January 1, 1997 by DGUV Regulation 11 of the German Social Accident Insurance. Between January and mid-September 2010, the German Federal Aviation Office registered 229 dazzle attacks on helicopters and airplanes of German airlines nationwide. On October 18, 2017, a perpetrator of a dazzle attack on a federal police helicopter was sentenced to one year and six months in prison without parole.\n\n\n=== Electromagnetic radiation exposure ===\n\nElectrosmog is colloquially understood as the exposure of humans and the environment to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields, some of which are believed to have undesirable biological effects. Electromagnetic environmental compatibility (EMC) refers to the effects on living organisms, some of which are considered electrosensitive. Fears of such effects have existed since the beginning of technological use in the mid-19th century. In 1890, for example, officials of the Royal General Directorate in Bavaria were forbidden to attend the opening ceremony of Germany's first alternating current power plant, the Reichenhall Electricity Works, or to enter the machine room. With the establishment of the first radio telegraphy and its telegraph stations, the U.S. magazine The Atlanta Constitution reported in April 1911 on the potential dangers of radio telegraph waves, which, in addition to \"tooth loss,\" were said to cause hair loss and make people \"crazy\" over time. Full-body protection was recommended as a preventive measure.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, other sources of electromagnetic fields have become the focus of health concerns, such as power lines, photovoltaic systems, microwave ovens, computer and television screens, security devices, radar equipment, and more recently, cordless telephones (DECT), cell phones, their base stations, energy-saving lamps, and Bluetooth connections. Electrified railroad lines, tram overhead lines and subway tracks are also strong sources of electrosmog. In 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the EMF (ElectroMagnetic Fields) Project to bring together current knowledge and available resources from key international and national organizations and scientific institutions on electromagnetic fields. The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) published the following recommendation in 2006:\n\n\"In order to avoid possible health risks, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection recommends that you minimize your personal exposure to radiation through your own initiative.\"\nAs of 2016, the EMF Guideline 2016 of EUROPAEM (European Academy For Environmental Medicine) on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related complaints and diseases applies.\n\n\n==== Microwaves ====\nA microwave oven, invented in 1950 by U.S. researcher Percy Spencer (1894-1970), is used to quickly heat food using microwave radiation at a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz. In an intact microwave oven, leakage radiation is relatively low due to the shielding of the cooking chamber. An \"emission limit of five milliwatts per square centimeter (equivalent to 50 watts per square meter) at a distance of five centimeters from the surface of the appliance\" (radiation density or power flux density) is specified. Children should not stand directly in front of or next to the appliance while food is being prepared. In addition, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection lists pregnant women as particularly at risk.\nIn microwave therapy, electromagnetic waves are generated for heat treatment. The penetration depth and energy distribution vary depending on the frequency of application (short waves, ultra short waves, microwaves). To achieve greater penetration, pulsed microwaves are used, each of which delivers high energy to the tissue. A pulse pause ensures that no burns occur. Metal implants and pacemakers are contraindications.\n\n\n==== Cell phones ====\n\nThe discussion about possible health risks from mobile phone radiation has been controversial to date, although there are currently no valid results. According to the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection\n\n\"there are still uncertainties in the risk assessment that could not be completely eliminated by the German Mobile Telecommunication Research Program, in particular possible health risks of long-term exposure to high-frequency electromagnetic fields from cell phone calls in adults (intensive cell phone use over more than 10 years) and the question of whether the use of cell phones by children could have an effect on health. For these reasons, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection still considers preventive health protection (precaution) to be necessary: exposure to electromagnetic fields should be kept as low as possible.\"\n\nThe German Federal Office for Radiation Protection recommends, among other things, mobile phones with a low SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) and the use of headsets or hands-free devices to keep the mobile phone away from the head. There is some discussion that mobile phone radiation may increase the incidence of acoustic neuroma, a benign tumor that arises from the vestibulocochlear nerve. It should therefore be reduced. In everyday life, a mobile phone transmits at maximum power only in exceptional cases. As soon as it is near a cell where maximum power is no longer needed, it is instructed by that cell to reduce its power. Electrosmog or cell phone radiation filters built into cell phones are supposed to protect against radiation. The effect is doubtful from the point of view of electromagnetic environmental compatibility, because the radiation intensity of the cell phone is increased disproportionately in order to obtain the necessary power. The same is true for use in a car without an external antenna, as the necessary radiation can only penetrate through the windows, or in areas with poor network coverage. Since 2004, radio network repeaters have been developed for mobile phone networks (GSM, UMTS, Tetrapol) that can amplify the reception of a mobile phone cell in shaded buildings. This reduces the SAR value of the mobile phone when making calls.\nThe SAR value of a WLAN router is only a tenth of that of a cell phone, although this drops by a further 80% at a distance of just one meter. The router can be set so that it switches off when not in use, for example at night.\n\n\n==== Electric fields ====\n\n\n===== High-voltage power lines =====\nUntil now, electrical energy has been transported from the power plant to the consumer almost exclusively via high-voltage lines, in which alternating current flows at a frequency of 50 Hertz. As part of the energy transition, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems are also planned in Germany. Since the amendment of the 26th Federal Immission Control Ordinance (BImSchV) in 2013, emissions from HVDC systems are also regulated by law. The limit is set to prevent interference with electronic implants caused by static magnetic fields. No limit has been set for static electric fields.\n\n\n===== Domestic electrical installation =====\nGround fault interrupters are available to reduce electric fields and (in the case of current flow) magnetic fields from residential electrical installations. In plaster installations, only a small part of the electric field can escape from the wall. However, a mains disconnect switch automatically disconnects the relevant line as long as no electrical load is switched on; as soon as a load is switched on, the mains voltage is also switched on. Ground fault interrupters were introduced in 1973 and have been continuously improved over the decades. In 1990, for example, it became possible to disconnect the PEN conductor (formerly known as the neutral conductor). Circuit breakers can be installed in several different circuits, preferably in those that supply bedrooms. However, they only turn off when no continuous current consumers such as air conditioners, fans, humidifiers, electric alarm clocks, night lights, standby devices, alarm systems, chargers, and similar devices are turned on. Instead of the mains voltage, a low voltage (2-12 volts) is applied, which can be used to detect when a consumer is switched on.\nRooms can also be shielded with copper wallpaper or special wall paints containing metal, thus applying the Faraday cage principle.\n\n\n==== Body scanner ====\n\nSince about 2005, body scanners have been used primarily at airports for security (passenger) screening. Passive scanners detect the natural radiation emitted by a person's body and use it to locate objects worn or concealed on the body. Active systems also use artificial radiation to improve detection by analyzing the backscatter. A distinction is made between body scanners that use ionizing radiation (usually X-rays) and those that use non-ionizing radiation (terahertz radiation).\n\nThe integrated components operating in the lower terahertz range emit less than 1 mW (-3 dBm), so no health effects are expected. There are conflicting studies from 2009 on whether genetic damage can be detected as a result of terahertz radiation. In the U.S., backscatter x-ray scanners make up the majority of devices used. Scientists fear that a future increase in cancer could pose a greater threat to the life and limb of passengers than terrorism itself. It is not clear to the passenger whether the body scanners used during a particular checkpoint use only terahertz or also X-ray radiation.\n\nAccording to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, the few available results from investigations in the frequency range of active whole-body scanners that work with millimeter wave or terahertz radiation do not yet allow a conclusive assessment from a radiation protection perspective (as of 24 May 2017).\nIn the vicinity of the plant, where employees or other third parties may be present, the limit value of the permissible annual dose for a single person in the population of one millisievert (1 mSv, including pregnant women and children) is not exceeded, even in the case of permanent presence.\nIn the case of X-ray scanners for hand luggage, it is not necessary to set up a radiation protection area by Section §19 RöV, as the radiation exposure during a hand luggage check for passengers does not exceed 0.2 microsievert (μSv), even under unfavorable assumptions. For this reason, employees involved in baggage screening are not considered to be occupationally exposed to radiation in accordance with Section §31 X-ray Ordinance and therefore do not have to wear a dosimeter.\n\n\n==== Radiation protection for electromedical treatment procedures ====\n\nElectromagnetic alternating fields have been used in medicine since 1764, mainly for heating and increasing blood circulation (diathermy, short-wave therapy) to improve wound and bone healing. The relevant radiation protection is regulated by the Medical Devices Act together with the Medical Devices Operator Ordinance. The Medical Devices Act came into force in Germany on January 14, 1985. It divided the medical devices known at that time into groups according to their degree of risk to the patient. The Medical Devices Ordinance regulated the handling of medical devices until January 1, 2002, when it was replaced by the Medical Devices Act. When ionizing radiation is used in medicine, the benefit must outweigh the potential risk of tissue damage (justifiable indication). For this reason, radiation protection is of great importance. The design should be optimized according to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle as soon as an application is described as suitable. Since 1996, the European ALARA Network (EAN), founded by the European Commission, has been working on the further implementation of the ALARA principle in radiation protection.\n\n\n=== Infrared radiation ===\nDiscovered around 1800 by the German-British astronomer, engineer and musician Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel (1738-1822), infrared radiation primarily produces heat. If the increase in body temperature and the duration of exposure exceed critical limits, heat damage and even heat stroke can result. Due to the still unsatisfactory data situation and the partly contradictory results, it is not yet possible to give clear recommendations for radiation protection with regard to infrared radiation. However, the findings regarding the acceleration of skin aging by infrared radiation are sufficient to describe the use of infrared radiation against wrinkles as counterproductive.\nIn 2011, the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance established exposure limit values to protect the skin from burns caused by thermal radiation. The IFA recommends that, in addition to the limit specified in EU Directive 2006/25/EC to protect the skin from burns for exposure times up to 10 seconds, a limit for exposure times between 10 and 1000 seconds should be applied. In addition, all radiation components in the wavelength range from 380 to 20000 nm should be considered for comparison with the limit values.\n\n\n== Radiation protection regulations ==\n\n\n=== First radiation protection regulations ===\nA leaflet published by the German Radiological Society (DRG) in 1913 was the first systematic approach to radiation protection. The physicist and co-founder of the society, Bernhard Walter (1861-1950), was one of the pioneers of radiation protection.\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) were established at the Second International Congress of Radiology in Stockholm in 1928. In the same year, the first international radiation protection recommendations were adopted and each country represented was asked to develop a coordinated radiation control program. The United States representative, Lauriston Taylor of the US Bureau of Standards (NSB), formed the Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection, later renamed the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). The NCRP received a Congressional charter in 1964 and continues to develop guidelines to protect individuals and the public from excessive radiation. In the years that followed, numerous other organizations were established by almost every president.\n\n\n=== Radiation protection monitoring ===\n\nIndividuals in professions such as pilots, nuclear physicians, and nuclear power plant workers are regularly exposed to ionizing radiation. In Germany, over 400,000 workers undergo occupational radiation monitoring to safeguard against the harmful effects of radiation. Approximately 70,000 individuals employed across various industries possess a radiation pass (distinct from an X-ray pass - see below). Individuals who may receive an annual effective dose of more than 1 millisievert during their work are required to undergo radiation protection monitoring. In Germany, the effective dose from natural radiation is 2.1 millisieverts per year. Radiation dose is measured using dosimeters, and the occupational dose limit is 20 millisieverts per year. Monitoring also applies to buildings, plant components or (radioactive) substances. These are exempted from the scope of the Radiation Protection Ordinance by a special administrative act, the exemption in radiation protection. To this end, it must be ensured that the resulting radiation exposure for an individual member of the public does not exceed 10 µSv per calendar year and that the resulting collective dose does not exceed 1 person sievert per year.\n\n\n=== Radiation protection register ===\nAccording to \n§ 170\nStrlSchG [Radiation Protection Act] (in German)\nall occupationally exposed persons and holders of radiation passports require a radiation protection register number (SSR number or SSRN), a unique personal identification number, as of December 31, 2018. The SSR number facilitates and improves the allocation and balancing of individual dose values from occupational radiation exposure in the radiation protection register. It replaces the former radiation passport number. It is used to monitor dose limits. Companies are obliged to deploy their employees in such a way that the radiation dose to which they are exposed does not exceed the limit of 20 millisieverts per calendar year. In Germany, about 440,000 people were classified as occupationally exposed to radiation in 2016. According to \n§ 145\nStrlSchG [German Radiation Protection Act] (in German)\nparagraph 1, Sentence 1, \"in the case of remediation and other measures to prevent and reduce exposure at radioactively contaminated sites, the person who carries out the measures himself or has them carried out by workers under his supervision must carry out an assessment of the body dose of the workers before starting the measures\". Applications for SSR numbers must be submitted to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) by March 31, 2019 for all employees currently under surveillance.\nThe application for the SSR number at the Federal Office and the transmission of the necessary data must be ensured following \n§ 170\nStrlSchG [German Radiation Protection Act] (in German)\nparagraph 4 sentence 4 by\n\nRadiation protection officer or by the\nresponsible person in accordance with\n§ 131\nStrlSchG (in German) paragraph 1 or \n§ 145\nStrlSchG (in German) paragraph 1 sentence 1 or by the\n\nthe person responsible under\n\n§ 115\nStrlSchG (in German) paragraph 2 or \n§ 153\nStrlSchG (in German) paragraph 1.\nThe SSR numbers must then be available for further use as part of normal communication with monitoring stations or radiation pass authorities. The SSR number is derived from the social security number and personal data using non-traceable encryption. The transmission takes place online. Approximately 420,00 persons are monitored for radiation protection in Germany (as of 2019).\nEmergency responders (including volunteers) who are not occupationally exposed persons within the meaning of the Radiation Protection Act also require an SSR number retrospectively, i.e. after an operation in which they were exposed to radiation above the limits specified in the Radiation Protection Ordinance, as all relevant exposures must be recorded in the Radiation Protection Register.\n\n\n=== Radiation protection areas ===\n\nRadiation protection areas are spatial areas in which either people can receive certain body doses during their stay or in which a certain local dose rate is exceeded. They are defined in § 36 of the Radiation Protection Ordinance and in §§ 19 and 20 of the X-Ray Ordinance. According to the Radiation Protection Ordinance, radiation protection areas are divided into restricted areas (local dose rate ≥ 3 mSv/hour), control areas (effective dose > 6 mSv/year) and monitoring areas (effective dose > 1 mSv/year), depending on the hazard.\n\n\n== Radiological emergency response projects ==\n\n\n=== Early warning systems ===\nGermany, Austria and Switzerland, among many other countries, have early warning systems in place to protect the population.\nThe local dose rate measurement network (ODL measurement network) is a measurement system for radioactivity operated by the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection, which determines the local dose rate at the measurement site.\nIn Austria, the Radiation Early Warning System is a measurement and reporting system established in the late 1970s to provide early detection of elevated levels of ionizing radiation in the country and to enable the necessary measures to be taken. The readings are automatically sent to the central office at the Ministry, where they can be accessed by the relevant departments, such as the Federal Warning Center or the warning centers of the federal states.\nNADAM (Network for Automatic Dose Alerting and Measurement) is the gamma radiation monitoring network of the Swiss National Emergency Operations Center. The monitoring network is complemented by the MADUK stations (Monitoring Network for Automatic Dose Rate Monitoring in the Environment of Nuclear Power Plants) of the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI).\n\n\n=== Project NERIS-TP ===\nIn 2011-2014, the NERIS-TP project aimed to discuss the lessons learned from the European EURANOS project on nuclear emergency response with all relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n=== Project PREPARE ===\nThe European PREPARE project aims to fill gaps in nuclear and radiological emergency preparedness identified after the Fukushima accident. The project aims to review emergency response concepts for long-lived releases, to address issues of measurement methods and food safety in the case of transboundary contamination, and to fill gaps in decision support systems (source term reconstruction, improved dispersion modeling, consideration of aquatic dispersion pathways in European river systems).\n\n\n=== Project IMIS ===\nEnvironmental radioactivity has been monitored in Germany since the 1950s. Until 1986, this was carried out by various authorities that did not coordinate with each other. Following the confusion during the Chernobyl reactor disaster in April 1986, measurement activities were pooled in the IMIS (Integrated Measurement and Information System) project, an environmental information system for monitoring radioactivity in Germany. Previously, the measuring equipment was affiliated to the warning offices under the name WADIS (\"Warning service information system\").\n\n\n=== Project CONCERT ===\nThe aim of the CONCERT (European Joint Programme for the Integration of Radiation Protection Research) project is to establish a joint European program for radiation protection research in Europe in 2018, based on the current strategic research programs of the European research platforms MELODI (radiation effects and radiation risks), ALLIANCE (radioecology), NERIS (nuclear and radiological emergency response), EURADOS (radiation dosimetry) and EURAMED (medical radiation protection).\n\n\n=== Project REWARD ===\nThe REWARD (Real time wide area radiation surveillance system) project was established to address the threats of nuclear terrorism, missing radioactive sources, radioactive contamination and nuclear accidents. The consortium developed a mobile system for real time wide area radiation monitoring based on the integration of new miniaturized solid state sensors. Two sensors are used: a cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) detector for gamma radiation and a high efficiency neutron detector based on novel silicon technologies. The gamma and neutron detectors are integrated into a single monitoring device called a tag. The sensor unit includes a wireless communication interface to remotely transmit data to a monitoring base station, which also uses a GPS system to calculate the tag's position.\n\n\n=== Task force for all types of nuclear emergencies ===\n\nThe Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST) is a US program for all types of nuclear emergencies of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the United States Department of Energy and is also a counter-terrorism unit that responds to incidents involving radioactive materials or nuclear weapons in US possession abroad. It was founded in 1974/75 under US President Gerald Ford and renamed the Nuclear Emergency Support Team in 2002. In 1988, a secret agreement from 1976 between the USA and the Federal Republic of Germany became known, which stipulates the deployment of NEST in the Federal Republic. In Germany, a similar unit has existed since 2003 with the name Central Federal Support Group for Serious Cases of Nuclear-Specific Emergency Response (ZUB).\n\n\n== Legal basis ==\nAs early as 1905, the Frenchman Viktor Hennecart called for special legislation to regulate the use of X-rays. In England, Sidney Russ (1879-1963) suggested to the British Roentgen Society in 1915 that it should develop its own set of safety standards, which it did in July 1921 with the formation of the British X-Ray and Radium Protection Committee. In the United States, the American X-Ray Society developed its own guidelines in 1922. In the German Reich, a special committee of the German X-Ray Society under Franz Maximilian Groedel (1881-1951), Hans Liniger (1863-1933) and Heinz Lossen (1893-1967) formulated the first guidelines after the First World War. In 1953, the employers' liability insurance associations issued the accident prevention regulation \"Use of X-rays in medical facilities\" based on the legal basis in § 848a of the Reich Insurance Code (RVG). In the GDR, the Occupational Safety and Health Regulation (ASAO) 950 was in effect from 1954 to 1971. It was replaced by ASAO 980 on April 1, 1971.\n\n\n=== EURATOM ===\nThe European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) was founded on March 25, 1957, by the Treaty of Rome between France, Italy, the Benelux countries and the Federal Republic of Germany, and remains almost unchanged to this day. Chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty regulates measures to protect the health of the population. Article 35 requires facilities for the continuous monitoring of soil, air and water for radioactivity. As a result, monitoring networks have been set up in all Member States and the data collected is sent to the EU's central database (EURDEP, European Radiological Data Exchange Platform). The platform is part of the EU's ECURIE system for the exchange of information in the event of radiological emergencies and became operational in 1995. Switzerland also participates in this information system.\n\n\n=== Legal basis in Germany ===\nIn Germany, the first X-ray regulation (RGBl. I p. 88) was issued in 1941 and originally applied to non-medical companies. The first medical regulations were issued in October 1953 by the Main Association of Industrial Employer's Liability Insurance Associations as accident prevention regulations for the Reich Insurance Code. Basic standards for radiation protection were introduced by directives of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) on February 2, 1959. The Atomic Energy Act of December 23, 1959 is the national legal basis for all radiation protection legislation in the Federal Republic of Germany (West) with the Radiation Protection Ordinance of June 24, 1960 (only for radioactive substances), the Radiation Protection Ordinance of July 18, 1964 (for the medical sector) and the X-ray Ordinance of March 1, 1973. Radiation protection was formulated in § 1, according to which life, health and property are to be protected from the dangers of nuclear energy and the harmful effects of ionizing radiation and damage caused by nuclear energy or ionizing radiation is to be compensated. The Radiation Protection Ordinance sets dose limits for the general population and for occupationally exposed persons. In general, any use of ionizing radiation must be justified and radiation exposure must be kept as low as possible even below the limit values. To this end, physicians, dentists and veterinarians, for example, must provide proof every five years - by Section 18a (2) X-ray Ordinance. in the version dated April 30, 2003 - that their specialist knowledge in radiation protection has been updated and must complete a full-day course with a final examination. Specialist knowledge in radiation protection is required by the Technical Knowledge Guideline according to X-ray Ordinance. - R3 for persons who work with baggage screening equipment, industrial measuring equipment and interfering emitters. Since 2019, the regulatory areas of the previous X-ray and radiation protection ordinances have been merged in the amended Radiation Protection Ordinance.\nThe Radiation Protection Commission (SSK) was founded in 1974 as an advisory body to the Federal Ministry of the Interior. It emerged from Commission IV \"Radiation Protection\" of the German Atomic Energy Commission, which was founded on January 26, 1956. After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection was established in the Federal Republic of Germany. The creation of this ministry was primarily a response to the perceived lack of coordination in the political response to the Chernobyl disaster and its aftermath. On December 11, 1986, the German Bundestag passed the Precautionary Radiation Protection Act (StrVG) to protect the population, to monitor radioactivity in the environment, and to minimize human exposure to radiation and radioactive contamination of the environment in the event of radioactive accidents or incidents. The last revision of the X-Ray Ordinance was issued on January 8, 1987. As part of a comprehensive modernization of German radiation protection law, which is largely based on Directive 2013/59/Euratom, the provisions of the X-Ray Ordinance have been incorporated into the revised Radiation Protection Ordinance.\nAmong many other measures, contaminated food was withdrawn from the market on a large scale. Parents were strongly advised not to let their children play in sandboxes. Some of the contaminated sand was replaced. In 1989, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection was incorporated into the Ministry of the Environment. On April 30, 2003, a new precautionary radiation protection law was promulgated to implement two EU directives on the health protection of persons against the dangers of ionizing radiation during medical exposure. The protection of workers from optical radiation (infrared radiation (IR), visible light (VIS) and ultraviolet radiation (UV)), which falls under the category of non-ionizing radiation, is regulated by the Ordinance on the Protection of Workers from Artificial Optical Radiation of 19 July 2010. It is based on the EU Directive 2006/25/EC of April 27, 2006. On March 1, 2010, the \"Act on the Protection of Humans from Non-Ionizing Radiation\" (NiSG), BGBl. I p. 2433, came into force, according to which the use of sunbeds by minors has been prohibited since August 4, 2009, in accordance with\n\n§ 4\nNiSG [Network and Information Systems Security Ordinance – NIS Ordinance] (in German)\nA new Radiation Protection Act came into force in Germany on October 1, 2017.\nIn Germany, a radiation protection officer directs and supervises activities to ensure radiation protection when handling radioactive materials or ionizing radiation. Their duties are described in \n\n§ 31-33\nStrlSchV (in German)\nof the Radiation Protection Ordinance and \n\n§ 13-15\nRöV (in German)\nof the X-Ray Ordinance. They are appointed by the radiation protection officer, who is responsible for ensuring that all radiation protection regulations are observed.\n\n\n==== X-ray passport ====\nSince 2002, an x-ray pass is a document in which the examining physician or dentist must enter information about the x-ray examinations performed on the patient. The main aim was to avoid unnecessary repeat examinations. According to the new Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV), practices and clinics are no longer obliged to offer their patients X-ray passports and to enter examinations in them. The Radiation Protection Ordinance came into force on December 31, 2018, together with the Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG) passed in 2017, replacing the previous Radiation Protection Ordinance and the X-ray Ordinance. The Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) continues to advise patients to keep records of their own radiation diagnostic examinations. On its website, the BfS provides a downloadable document that can be used for personal documentation.\n\n\n=== Legal basis in Switzerland ===\n\nIn Switzerland, institutionalized radiation protection began in 1955 with the issuance of guidelines for protection against ionizing radiation in medicine, laboratories, industry and manufacturing plants, although these were only recommendations. The legal basis was created by a new constitutional article (Art. 24), according to which the federal government issues regulations on protection against the dangers of ionizing radiation. On this basis, a corresponding federal law entered into force on July 1, 1960. The first Swiss ordinance on radiation protection entered into force on May 1, 1963. On October 7, 1963, the Federal Department of Home Affairs (EDI) issued the following decrees to supplement the ordinance:\n\non radiation protection in medical X-ray equipment\non radiation protection in shoe X-ray machines (of which about 850 were in operation in 1963; the last one was not decommissioned until 1990)\non the radioactivity of luminous dials.\nAnother 40 regulations followed. The monitoring of such facilities took many years due to a lack of personnel. From 1963, dosimeters were to be used for personal protection, but this met with great resistance. It was not until 1989 that an updated radiation protection law was passed, accompanied by radiation protection training for the people concerned.\n\n\n=== Legal basis in Austria ===\nThe legal basis for radiation protection in Austria is the Radiation Protection Act (BGBl. 277/69 as amended) of June 11, 1969. The tasks of radiation protection extend to the fields of medicine, commerce and industry, research, schools, worker protection and food. The General Radiation Protection Ordinance, Federal Law Gazette II No. 191/2006, has been in force since June 1, 2006. Based on the Radiation Protection Act, it regulates the handling of radiation sources and measures for protection against ionizing radiation. The Optical Radiation Ordinance (VOPST) is a detailed ordinance to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (ASchG).\nOn August 1, 2020, a new radiation protection law came into force, which largely harmonized the radiation protection regulations for artificial radioactive substances and terrestrial natural radioactive substances. They are now enshrined in the General Radiation Protection Ordinance 2020. Companies that carry out activities with naturally occurring radioactive substances are now subject to the licensing or notification requirements pursuant to Sections 15 to 17 of the Radiation Protection Act 2020, unless an exemption provision pursuant to Sections 7 or 8 of the General Radiation Protection Ordinance 2020 applies. Cement production including maintenance of clinker kilns, production of primary iron and tin, lead and copper smelting are included in the scope. If a company falls within the scope of the General Radiation Protection Ordinance 2020, its owner must commission an officially authorized monitoring body. The mandate includes dose assessment for workers who may be exposed to increased radiation exposure and, if necessary, determination of the activity concentration of residues and radioactive substances discharged with the air or waste water.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of civilian nuclear accidents\n\n\n== External links ==\nLaws, ordinances, guidelines, expert opinions and publications on radiation protection, timeline since 2002 of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection.

        "content": "Damaiyu Subdistrict (in Chinese: 大麦屿街道) is a subdistrict office under the jurisdiction of Yuhuan City, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. Its predecessor was Chenyu Town (陈屿镇). It covers a land area of 70.93 square kilometers and administers 6 communities and 48 administrative villages. According to the 2017 census, Damaiyu Subdistrict has a registered population of 56,476 people, with an additional approximate 41,000 registered non-local population. The subdistrict government office is located at No. 516 Xinggang West Road. Within its territory lies the national first-class port, the Damaiyu Port. In 1994, entrepreneurs Su Zengfu and Su Xianze registered and established Supor, which has since become China's largest and the world's second-largest cookware production enterprise.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1949, the entire area of Chenyu Town belonged to Chenao Township (陈岙乡). Chenyu People's Commune was established in 1961, and in 1984, it was renamed Chenyu Town.On June 19, 1992, the Damaiyu Economic Development Zone Management Committee was established. On November 6, 1993, the Damaiyu Economic Development Zone was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Chenyu Town and the Damaiyu Economic Development Zone Management Committee shared offices.In June 2000, Chenyu Town was renamed Chenyu Town Office of Zhugang Town, under the administration of Zhugang Town. In October 2001, Xiandie Town was merged into Chenyu Office. In December 2008, Chenyu Town Office of Zhugang Town and Damaiyu Economic Development Zone were separated. In August 2009, Zhugang Town was abolished, and Chenyu Town Office of Zhugang Town was renamed Damaiyu Subdistrict. Other changes in administrative divisions included Yucheng Subdistrict and Kanmen Subdistrict. The name \"Damaiyu\" comes from the government office located in Damaiyu Community.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCurrently, Damaiyu has gradually formed an economy centered around cookware, industrial sewing machines, eyewear accessories, and plumbing equipment manufacturing. Supor and Zhongjie Sewing Machine Co., Ltd. are the earliest two listed companies in Yuhuan. China's first self-built million-kilowatt ultra-supercritical coal-fired unit power plant, Huaneng Yuhuan Power Plant, is also located in Damaiyu Subdistrict. In 2015, the subdistrict achieved an industrial output value of 11.929 billion yuan.\nDamaiyu Subdistrict is home to a national first-class port - Damaiyu Water Transport Port (Damaiyu Port). In 2008, Damaiyu Port was upgraded from a second-class port to a first-class port and officially opened for operation on September 16, 2011.\n\n\n== Administrative Division ==\nDamaiyu Subdistrict administers the following areas, comprising 7 communities and 28 administrative villages: Damaiyu Community, Tielongtou Community, Shuangfeng Community, Liuyuan Community, Longshan Community, Xiandie Community, and Qinglan Community; Xinyuan Village, Gangzaitou Village, Xintang Village, Xiaomaiyu Village, Wuyi Village, Xiaogushun Village, Shiwumu Village, Aoli Village, Gushun Village, Huanhai Village, Changshanzui Village, Lidun Village, Doumentou Village, Punan Village, Huochakou Village, Xiaqingtang Village, Liandie Village, Yangjia Village, Zengjia Village, Waiye Village, Longwan Village, Gaosheng Village, Fushan Village, Fengshan Village, Fuyuan Village, Fengcheng Village, Lianfeng Village, and Fengyang Village.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYuhuan Economic Development Zone\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nYuhuan City Website: Government Information Disclosure of Damaiyu Subdistrict Office (in Chinese).\nZhejiang Government Network · Yuhuan City · Damaiyu Subdistrict (in Chinese).",

Hawk senses an evil presence in the cave and flees.\nAn ancient beast known as the Crota has been awakened by the earthquake. It slaughters a herd of cattle and a farmer. While investigating, Harding is attacked by the creature. He is injured but chases it away with his cigarette lighter. Harding tells hospital staff and fellow officers about the monster, but they assume he was attacked by a bear.\nLittle Hawk arrives at the hospital and relates the legend of the Crota to Lloyd, Harding's deputy. Lloyd does not believe Little Hawk; he decides that killing the bear will allow him to defeat Harding in the next election. Lloyd takes a group of officers into the Devil's Boot on a bear hunt. They discover an underground city. The officers split up to explore; most are attacked and killed by the Crota. Harding leaves the hospital and goes to Devil's Boot. Lloyd radios to Harding, telling him to talk to Little Hawk before Lloyd loses radio contact.\nMeanwhile, Little Hawk consults with a group of Lakota elders including George Strongeagle. Strongeagle agrees to help Little Hawk defeat the Crota. Harding meets with Little Hawk, who reveals that it wasn't Harding's cigarette lighter that scared the Crota away. Instead, it was an amulet that Harding inherited from his Native American grandmother. Harding, Little Hawk, and Strongeagle perform a sweat lodge ceremony, where they learn that “white men’s weapons” will not work against the Crota. The spirit of Harding's grandmother leads him to a foxskin bundle, which contains three Cheyenne arrows that can kill magical creatures.\nThe group journeys through the cave to the underground city. Lloyd is killed by the Crota, while Little Hawk is injured. Harding uses his grandmother's arrows to kill the monster. Little Hawk and Strongeagle decide to return to their reservations. Harding decides to retire as sheriff.\n\n\n== Reception and awards ==\nPublishers Weekly wrote that the \"energy of a grade-B monster movie pervades Goingback's debut novel. So do that genre's cliches, including the tired theme of the Indian curse.\" The review criticized the author's \"stale prose\" but praised the accounts of Indian legends, which \"have the flavor of the authentic oral tradition\". The review concludes that \"Goingback keeps the action brisk and knows where to put the necessary lucky coincidence or happy twist to distract readers from his tale's unwavering simplicity.\"\nA review for Kirkus stated that the novel's premise was similar to, but less appealing than, the 1995 Christian crossover novel The Oath by Frank Peretti. The review further stated that \"Goingback is readable and his Choctaw lore appealing. But his story quickly drops into the banal suspense of a Dean Koontz or Clive Barker. He isn't, however, any worse.\"\nThe novel won the 1993 Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel and was nominated for the 1993 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Low Pavement is a short street located in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. It connects West Bars to Vicar Lane. The street is a shopping district.Low Pavement, as well as the adjoining roads and the market square, is part of Chesterfield Town Centre Conservation Area. The road was also included in the Revitalisation that was awarded a European Heritage medal in 1981.\n\n\n== History ==\nChesterfield Market, one of the largest open air markets in the country, dating back to at least 1165 stands on the street. In the Medieval period the properties in Low Pavement were built on the northern edge of burgage plots that extended southwards beyond Beetwell Street to the River Hipper. The plots were long and narrow and subsequently built on so that a warren of alleyways developed behind them. It is known that the route of Low Pavement existed during the Mediaeval period, but it does not appear by name in any contemporary charters.  W. E. Godfrey hypothesises that it may have been named \"Cowgate\" at the time, a name which does appear but which is of uncertain location.From 1882 until 1927, the street was a terminus of the Chesterfield tramway.  In 1889, the Derbyshire Miners' Association moved its headquarters to the former Falcon Temperance Cafe, on the street, and remained there until 1893, when its purpose-built headquarters were opened.During the 1970s, the town council considered demolishing a large portion of the buildings on the street to construct The Pavements Shopping Centre, the buildings together were considered to be of 'township merit' and many became listed during this period. In early 1982, The Illustrated London News in a feature on Derbyshire noted the shops on Low Pavement had been in \"a sad state of dilapidation\", but were being \"beautifully restored\". The facades of many were left.On November 1981, The Pavements Shopping Centre was officially opened by the then Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. In July 2021 it was reported that Chesterfield Borough Council, who already owned the freehold, had acquired the leasehold of the shopping centre.\n\n\n== Listed buildings ==\n1 and 1A Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n3 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n5 and 7 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n9 Low Pavement  (Grade II listed)\n35 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n39 Low Pavement  (Grade II listed)\n41 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n43 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n45 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n61, 61A, 61B 63 and 63C Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n69 and 71 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n73 and 75 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)\n77 Low Pavement (Grade II listed)In addition, the Lamp standard outside 63 Low Pavement is Grade II listed, as is the Lamp post outside no. 35.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Saint Petersburg gubernatorial election will take place on 6–8 September 2024, on common election day. Incumbent Governor Alexander Beglov is eligible to run to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThen-Presidential Plenipotentiary to the Northwestern Federal District Alexander Beglov was appointed acting Governor of Saint Petersburg in October 2018, replacing two-term incumbent Georgy Poltavchenko, who resigned at his own request. Beglov previously served as acting Governor of Saint Petersburg between June and October 2003 after Vladimir Yakovlev's resignation and prior to the election of Valentina Matviyenko in the second round of 2003 gubernatorial election. Poltavchenko meanwhile was appointed as chairman of the board of the United Shipbuilding Corporation, where he served until August 2023.\nBeglov ran for a full term as an Independent, despite prior affiliations to the United Russia party, and faced a potential highly competitive election due to his soaring unpopularity and the city's overall heightened oppositional sentiments. Several notable candidates were absent from the ballot as Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg members Oleg Kapitonov (LDPR) and Boris Vishnevsky (Yabloko) failed to qualify, while State Duma member Vladimir Bortko (CPRF) unexpectedly withdrew on August 31. Beglov won the September 2019 election with 64.43% against two opponents, Legislative Assembly members Nadezhda Tikhonova of A Just Russia and Mikhail Amosov of Civic Platform, both of whom received around 16%.\nAmong the most notable events during Beglov's first term was his conflict with businessman and Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin.\nIn autumn 2022 Prigozhin claimed that he invested 2 billion rubles into Beglov's 2019 campaign, while the governor sabotaged Wagner's headquarters opening and awarded city contracts to his friends and cronies. Governor Beglov in return replied that the conflict with Prigozhin had been caused by the businessman's desire to control food catering, garbage disposal and subway construction in the city. The conflict wound down with Prigozhin's and his closest allies' demise in a plane crash in August 2023. Political experts claimed that Prigozhin's death virtually eliminated major opposition to Beglov and cleared his way to a second term in office.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIn Saint Petersburg candidates for Governor can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Governor of Saint Petersburg should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 10% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. In addition, self-nominated candidates should collect 2% of signatures of Saint Petersburg residents. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nNadezhda Tikhonova (SR–ZP), former Member of Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg (2016–2021), 2019 gubernatorial candidate\n\n\n=== Publicly expressed interest ===\nMikhail Amosov, Member of Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg (1994–2007, 2016–present), 2003 gubernatorial candidate, 2019 Civic Platform gubernatorial candidate\n\n\n=== Potential ===\nAlexander Beglov (Independent), incumbent Governor of Saint Petersburg (2003, 2018–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Russian regional elections\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Trade wind cumulus (or trade cumulus) clouds are formed by cooling and moisture absorption of the dry trade winds over the relatively cold sea surface in the eastern parts of the oceans.  These are  clouds, typically Cumulus humilis or Cumulus mediocris, which are considered as fair weather clouds.\nCharacteristic for trade wind clouds is the uniform height of the upper cloud limit, which typically lies between 1000 and 1500 meters and thus indicates the altitude of the trade wind inversion Due to orographic lift at  mountains, the clouds can also rise higher, but the trade wind inversion also limits a further rise here, so that even in this case a light drizzle can occur at best. At night, the trade wind clouds usually dissipate again, especially over land.\n\n\n== Details of the development ==\nThe trade wind inversion is strongest in the eastern areas of the tropical oceans. Here, the sinking air masses of the Hadley or Walker circulation and the sea breeze ensure that the subsidence inversion lies particularly deep. Below this, a thin, very uniform layer of stratocumulus clouds forms in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. In these areas, the water surface temperatures are relatively low due to the upwelling of cooler, deeper water. As a result of the low-lying inversion and cool water temperature, moisture content increases within the marine boundary layer and, with saturation, clouds form over a wide area of the eastern tropical oceans.\nFurther west, away from the coast, the subsidence weakens, the sea surface temperature rises and the clouds in the boundary layer become more cumulus-like, but often remain covered by stratocumulus at first. Even further downwind, the stratocumulus clouds disappear and the classic trade wind clouds develop, i.e. puffy cumulus clouds with active vertical transport of moisture and heat. These become the predominant phenomenon and extend over a large region until extensive convection dominates in the Convergence Zones.\n\n\n== Significance for the climate ==\nTrade wind clouds are found over about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. Since they reflect sunlight on their upper surface, they reduce the warming of the Earth's surface by solar radiation. Numerical climate models have great difficulty with the simulation of low clouds over the subtropical oceans, in particular the trade wind clouds. \nPreviously, it was expected that these clouds would decrease due to global warming and thus strengthen the latter, meaning that this development represents a positive feedback loop. However, a study published in 2022 based on empirical data concludes that the trade wind clouds are less sensitive to climate change than previously assumed.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was added to the National Register in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the Chicago Road was a major thoroughfare. Seeing an opportunity, in 1963 John and Mary Magocs (owners of a Detroit-area wholesale electronics business) purchased an empty field and constructed a drive-in movie theater. The theater was designed to replicate the Holiday Drive-In in Trenton, Michigan, whose owners were personal friends of the Magocs. The construction was completed in 1964 and opened for business on August 21, 1964, as a 804-car, single screen theater. The theater was operated by John and Mary Magocs along with their sons Tom and John Jr.\nIn 1977, the Magocs moved to Florida and leased the theater to William Clarke. In 1980 Tom and John Jr. resumed operation of the theater. In 1986 a second screen was installed; over time both the sound and video operations were improved. As of 2023, the theater is still in operation and run by the Magocs family.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Capri Drive-In Theater sits on approximately 16 acres of land. The theater complex includes two screen towers (one original, one added in 1986), the concession stand and projection building, the parking area and driveway system, a fence, ticket booth and canopy, backstop and light screen. It also includes lighting and signage, including the main entrance sign, reconstructed in 2001.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jizi (1941–2015, Chinese: 姬子, birth name Wang Yunshan) was a Chinese ink painter.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nYunshan Wang was born in Longguan County of Chahar Province (which was merged into Hebei Province in 1952) on 3 March 1941, and died on 8 July 2015 in Beijing. In 1959, Jizi moved from Longguan County to Xuanhua. From 1959 until 2000, Jizi lived in Xuanhua. From 2000, he lived in Beijing until he died in 2015.Jizi began painting in the late 1950s. During the Cultural Revolution, he made portraits of Chairman Mao. In the 1980s, Jizi, like many artists at the time, questioned the future of Chinese painting and the creative possibilities of brush and ink. This led him to explore what he called the \"Dao of Ink Landscapes\", referencing the philosophies of Laozi and Zhuangzi to emphasize the spirituality of Chinese landscape painting. He used layered ink, multiple optical effects, and a free assemblage of different forms in an attempt to capture the continuous transformation of natural phenomena such as water and clouds. His works have been described as \"macroscopic\".\n\n\n== Career and philosophy ==\nJizi had an almost half-century career that spanned a dynamic period of Chinese history, in Xuanhua and Beijing. In the last quarter of the 20th century, some Chinese scholars, critics, and artists decried traditional Chinese painting as out of step with an increasingly global world culture. Jizi countered that assertion, arguing that painting could indeed be authentically Chinese in terms of traditional techniques and styles, and still address the present-day needs of individuals everywhere. The artworks displayed in the travelling exhibition \"Jizi: Journey of the Spirit\" reveal the artist's decades-long search for this synthesis of techniques, styles, philosophies, and ideas that honour tradition, reinforce the ideal of a universal oneness of all things, and embrace personal expression.\nIn his early years as an artist, Jizi embraced Maoist socialist realism—an ideology that rejected spirituality outright. In the aftermath of Mao's death in 1976 and the attendant shift in the nature of the Chinese Communist Party's concept of socialism, Jizi began exploring means to reintroduce the concept of spirit. After experimenting with a variety of theories and methods, Jizi settled on his own practice, which he called \"Dao of Ink Painting\". Dao (or Tao) is a fundamental principle of ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes harmony with nature. Ink painting is a traditional technique with origins in ancient China; it is a practice in which paintings are created with black ink and a brush.\nCaught up in the problem of contemporary art, often read as Western, and its relationship to the long and venerated tradition of Chinese painting, Jizi's journey was one of commitment to the time-honoured and to the inventive—the philosophical and material. Believing that the two approaches could meaningfully coexist, Jizi searched for a new way of painting.\nIn his writings, Jizi explained the intertwining of meanings in the series titled Dao of Ink Landscapes: \"The Dao is the spirit of the great universe. What I seek as an artist is the unification of Heaven and Earth and Humanity, insight into the Dao, the material universe, and myself.\" Thus his work expresses the classical aesthetic principle that heaven and the human are one, as well as the thought that humans initiate relations that transform both the powers of heaven and earthly environments. Commentators emphasize that Jizi's paintings express Chinese traditional philosophy in ways that connect thoughts of unity or oneness with contemporary times: \"Jizi seeks to remain true to the cultural, spiritual, and philosophical roots of his homeland and yet speaks forcefully and eloquently about the new realities of modern life.\" His art breaches conventions of both traditional Chinese art and modern western art \"by going to the outer reaches of the cosmos and down to where matter is raw…\" At the same time, his paintings \"confront audiences with a sensuous apprehension of the world, one that forces the viewer to confront the meaning of individual existence…\" This approach to painting, which connects the cosmos with individual human existence, \"has transformed ink wash painting in ways that combine the philosophical position of the literati artist with a painting style of controlled chaos.\" One painting especially conveys the theme of energy: \"The Epic of Nature is cinematic, a cavalcade of nature…offering a symbolic record of heaven and earth, and humanity.\" Jizi's hills have been compared to dragons: \"When they do wake up, and stand on their heavy legs, the ground above them will split, and chasms will open up.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions and collections ==\nWorks by Jizi have been shown at the following exhibitions:\nJizi: Journey of the Spirit, Weisman Art Museum, Minnesota, United States (2017)\nJizi: Journey of the Spirit, WhiteBox, New York, United States (2018)\nSu Xinping, Weng Yunpeng & Jizi: A Moment In Beijing, Museum of Contemporary Art, Jacksonville, Florida, United States (2020)\nA Glimpse of Jizi's Ink World, Shandong Art Museum, Shandong, China (2021)The work Original Beginnings (元初) was in Jizi's possession from its production in 2007 until his death. It was kept in Beijing and then donated to the British Museum collections in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInk painting\nJizi\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrubaker, David Adam; Wang, Chunchen (2015).

Her PhD thesis was titled \"a criminological contribution to the discussion on the exemption of victims of intimate partner violence from testifying in criminal proceedings\".\nShe also holds a second masters qualification in Criminal Law and Comparative Social Problems from the University of Barcelona in addition to a first degree in Legal Sciences from the Central American University, San Salvador in El Salvador.\n\nShe is a Mexican who spent over twenty years working in organisations like Amnesty International Mexico before she applied to work for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR). The vacancy was created because the previous office holder's term had not been renewed because of alleged workplace harassment.\nHer appointment was announced in May and she began work at the start of June 2021 as IAHCR's Executive Secretary. Her appointment was for four years and that contract could be extended for another four years but then another person must take over. She was appointed by the OAS's secretary general, Luis Almagro, as a person of \"independence and high moral standing\" with a good understanding of human rights from ten candidates chosen for interview from 450 applicants. Her CV was published for public scrutiny.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Borys Fedorovich Bilash (Ukrainian: Борис Федорович Білаш; born 1 August 1941) is a Ukrainian writer, poet and politician who is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Merit. Additionally, he was a member of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada in 2007 and 2012.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 1 August 1941, in the Khanlar District of the Azerbaijani SSR. Borys and his family migrated to the Donbas in 1944, and he spent his childhood and adolescence in Horlivka. He was a miner after graduating from the Horlivka Industrial College, but soon continued his studies in 1974, where he graduated from the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhen Borys was younger, Volodymyr Yavorivsky observed that he was a free poet, with a little oddity here and there, but it was intriguing and he was later admitted into the Union of Writers. He is the writer of almost 30 works that have been released by Moscow, Kyiv, and Donbas publishing companies. Mainly in the Donbas, he used to have books in Moscow and Kyiv. His poetry on Sviatohirsk and his home country were also published in Moscow and Czechoslovakia. He asserted that he is a particularly well-known person in the Donbas, that kids study and even create poetry by him.\nWith the Party of Regions, No. 229 on the list, Borys was elected as the People's Deputy of Ukraine for the 5th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada, which took place from 20 February to 23 November 2007. Later, in March 2007, he joined the Committee on Human Rights, National Minorities, and International Relations, and in February 2007, he joined the Party of Region. From 29 February 2012 to 12 December 2012, he was once more chosen to serve as the People's Deputy of Ukraine for the 6th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada. This is to replace Oleksiy Lelyuk as deputy when his powers were prematurely ended by the Verkhovna Rada.\n\n\n== Political views ==\nBorys supported the Ukrainian draft law \"On the Principles of State Language Policy\" on 5 June 2012, endorsing the elevation of the status of Russian as the official language. Additionally, he has been observed in cases of Ukrainophobia, or Galician fear. In an interview, he was said to have stated, \"I love pure Ukrainian, not saturated with the surzhik of Austria-Hungary.\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nUpon being elected as People's Deputy in 2012, Borys declared that he was indeed a citizen of the Donbas, citing two reasons: first, President Viktor Yanukovych had heard his poetry, songs, and artistic evenings at the Philharmonic; second, both of them had simply known one other for a considerable amount of years when he was not in politics.\nGiven the propagandist character of his efforts and their low quality, the title of Hero of Ukraine was viewed adversely by a number of prominent individuals and organizations. A court appeal of the President's decree was made and the arguments are supported by the evidence that the order was passed in contravention of Article 6 of the Law \"On State Awards of Ukraine,\" which grants Ukrainian people the title in recognition of a noteworthy deed or exceptional work accomplishment. Yuriy Vynnychuk is adamant that Borys's designation as a Hero of Ukraine came about only as a result of his personal friendship with President Yanukovych. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorys is a pensioner in Donetsk.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nBorys has received awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (23 August 2011)\n Order of Merit Third Class (3 July 2002)\nHonored Worker of Culture of Ukraine (16 October 1999)\nHonorary Citizen of Sviatohirsk\nMember of the National Writers' Union of Ukraine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

All 43 members of Tandridge District Council in Surrey will be elected following boundary changes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTandridge was a historically Conservative council. The Conservatives held a majority on the council until 1990, when the Liberal Democrats became the largest party. They briefly retook the council in 1994, before losing it to no overall control again in 1995. The Conservatives formed a majority administration in 2000, which lasted until 2019.\nFollowing the previous election, independents had a total of 14 seats (up 2), the Liberal Democrats had 11, the Conservatives had 9 (down 2), and the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group had 8. The Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group and 10 independents run the council as a minority administration.\n\n\n== Boundary changes ==\nTandridge usually elects its councillors in thirds, on a 4-year cycle. However, following boundary changes, all councillors will be elected to the new wards. The change increases the number of councillors by 1.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helle Merete Brix (born 30 December 1959) is a Danish author, journalist and literary critic. She has been noted as a critic of Islam since the late 1990s, and was formerly associated with the Danish Free Press Society as editor of its online magazine Sappho until 2010, and was later a part of the Lars Vilks Committee.\n\n\n== Activities and writings ==\nBrix has been noted as a writer strongly critical of Islam since at least 1999, although she was a member of the Danish Social Liberal Party until 2002. She co-authored the book I krigens hus: Islams kolonisering af Vesten about Islam's \"colonisation of the West\" with Lars Hedegaard in 2003, which has been described as a part of the \"Eurabia narrative\". She was formerly a member of Danish PEN, but left the organisation in 2004 after it objected to admit Hedegaard as a member. Along with Hedegaard, Brix was later involved with several groupings, as part of the counter-jihad movement.\nShe was on the board of advisors for Hedegaard's Danish Free Press Society from 2005 to 2007, chief editor of its online magazine Sappho from 2005 to 2010, and on the board of advisors of the International Free Press Society founded in 2009. In 2008 she wrote the book Mod mørket. Det Muslimske Broderskab i Europa discussing the Muslim Brotherhood's activities in Europe. She had left the Danish Free Press Society by the early 2010s, after considering it too irreconcilable to differing viewpoints, and became a literary critic for Weekendavisen.\nBrix co-founded the Lars Vilks Committee in 2012, which was established in support of Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his Muhammad drawings controversy. In 2015, she was an organiser of the cultural event that was attacked by an Islamist terrorist in the Copenhagen shootings at the Krudttønden cultural centre, during which she hid under a table and in a storage room together with Vilks. The Lars Vilks Committee was dissolved in the late 2010s.\nShe published the book Gud og Profeten tilgiver ikke. En personlig beretning om terrorangrebet på Krudttønden in 2016 as a personal account of the terror attack at Krudttønden, and in 2018 published the book Blandt kolibrier og kalsjnikover. Om terrorens ofre about victims and people affected by terror attacks.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrix is a Buddhist, who converted to the religion after an interview with Lama Ole Nydahl in 1994, who she also says inspired her criticism of Islam.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNår kunsten terroriseres.

        "content": "The William J. and Lovila (Wooley) Moore House is a single family house located at 123 North Almer  Street in Caro, Michigan. It was built in 1868, extensively renovated in the 1920s, and added to the National Register in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house at this location was originally constructed in c. 1868. In 1914, William and Lovila Moore purchased the house. Moore owned a telephone exchange company, originally located in Sandusky, Michigan, but had moved to Caro in 1896. At the time they purchased the house, it was constructed in a Queen Anne style.\nIn 1923, the Moores began an extensive renovation of their Almer Street house, completely changing the appearance to the current Tudor Revival style. They also added a pool, tennis courts, and other conveniences. Lovila Moore lived inn the house until her death in 1937; William J. Moore lived in the house through his retirement in 1947 and until his death in 1955. After this, the couple's son Andrew Moore lived in the house. In 1967, Charles and Dorcus Vaughan bought the property from the Moores. The Vaughn family owned the property until 2017, and descendants of William J. and Lovila Moore lived in the house starting in 2021.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Moore House is a two-story Tudor Revival house is of frame construction, clad with wood shingles and stone veneer. If has an irregular L-shaped plan. The house has a distinctive, complex false thatched roofline with distinctive dormers on each side.\nThe house sits on a one-acre lot, which also contains a carriage house renovated in the same style, a swimming pool, a lotus pond, and a pump house. The lot is extensively landscaped with stone and concrete walkways, a rock garden, a concrete fountain, and other features.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections across the United Kingdom being held on the same day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Barnsley was a district of the South Yorkshire metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The South Yorkshire Combined Authority was established in 2014 as the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, which began electing the mayor of South Yorkshire in 2018.\nSince its formation, Barnsley has continuously been under Labour control. Councillors have predominantly been elected from the Labour Party, various independents, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. The council elected a large number of Barnsley Independent Group councillors in the 2006 election, whose numbers had fallen in subsequent elections until its dissolution as a party in 2023. Councillors who will be seeking re-election were most recently elected in the 2021 election, which was originally scheduled to be held in 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that election, seventeen Labour councillors were elected with 40.4% of the vote across the borough, with three Liberal Democrats on 11.8% of the vote across the borough and one Conservative with 25.1% of the vote across the borough. Labour held the Rockingham ward after a coin toss broke a tie between the Labour candidate and the Conservative candidate.In the most recent election in 2023, Labour won 15 seats, the Liberal Democrats won 4 seats and independents won 2 seats. After that election, the council had 48 Labour councillors, ten Liberal Democrats, two Conservatives, two independents, and one Reform UK councillor.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election will take place by first-past-the-post voting, with wards generally being represented by three councillors, with one elected in each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Barnsley aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\n8 November 2023: Mat Crisp (Liberal Democrat) resigns; seat will remain vacant until the regularly scheduled May 2024 elections.\nDecember 2023: Pooja Ramchandani (Labour) resigns; seat will remain vacant until the regularly schedule May 2024 elections.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Another Standard is an album by the American musician Bob Berg, released in 1997. Recorded for Stretch Records, it was Berg's first album of standards. Berg supported the album with UK and North American tours.\n\n\n== Production ==\nBerg was backed by pianist David Kikoski, bass player Ed Howard, and drummer Gary Novak; Randy Brecker contributed on flugelhorn and trumpet, and Mike Stern on guitar. Kikoski helped Berg arrange the songs and determine where they could substitute different key changes. \"My Man's Gone Now\" is a version of the composition from Porgy and Bess. \"No Trouble\", the only original on the album, was written by Berg.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nAnother Standard is considered to be Berg's best album. The Independent wrote that Berg \"is on good form, accompanied by a tidy rhythm section.\" The Guardian concluded that, \"while several pieces do spiral off into hoarse, multiphonic orbits, for much of the time Berg's intonation (particularly on resolving notes) resembles Sonny Rollins, and he brings to theme statements heard a thousand times a hollow, mournful tremor that refreshes them in completely personal ways.\" The Columbia Daily Tribune labeled Another Standard \"a near-classic jazz small-group recording.\"\nThe Record noted that \"Kikoski is a shining talent who often serves as McCoy Tyner to Berg's John Coltrane.\" The Ottawa Citizen said that, \"while the band's equipped with acoustic instruments, there's almost an electric fusion sensibility to the disc.\" The Birmingham Post opined that the version of the Beatles' \"Michelle\" \"is saved from its usual schmaltz pit.\"\nAllMusic determined that \"the arrangements are lightly swinging, with a refreshing lack of electric piano or bass, and there's nothing really wrong with the album, it's just got an unshakeable air of 'been there, done that.'\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kathy Toma (born 22 March 1944, Chambilly, Saône-et-Loire) is a French visual artist whose works combine painting with photography, sculpture, jewelry and lost objects. She is known in particular for her deep interest in the Italian composer Carlo Gesualdo whose music inspired her work for over 20 years leading not only to paintings but to presentations combining choral music with photography, film and screen-supported installations. Her works have been widely exhibited in France and Italy.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Chambilly on 22 March 1944, Kathy Toma is the daughter of a pianist. After studying drama, music and literature in Strasbourg, she earned a Ph.D. in history of art from the Sorbonne.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFor many years, Toma has lectured at the Centre Pompidou. Her works, which have been exhibited in numeerous exhibitions in Italy and France, address myth and memory, combining classical painting with film, video, innovative sculpture and jewelry. In particular, over more than 20 years she has devoted attention to developing her artistic work to Carlo Gesualdo, a composer of madrigals who lived in Ferrara in the late 16th century. In 2002, she presented paintings for the Chiesa di Maria Santissima Addolorata (Our Lady of Sorrows Church, 17th century) in Gesualdo, where she has become an honorary citizen. She has also contributed an impressive series of frescos to Gesualdo's Chiesa di San Rocco displayed in seven panels.\nOf particular note is her monumental fresco Polyptych for Expo 2015 at the Milan Cathedral. Toma has conducted reseach over a number of years and has been a frequent lecturer at the Centre Pompidou in Paris from 1977 to 2009.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKathy Toma's website",

        "content": "The Stiehl Assassin is a 2019 fantasy novel by Terry Brooks in his Shannara series. It is the third book in the Fall of Shannara series and was a New York Times bestselling novel.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel picks up where The Skaar Invasion left off, with Tavo plunging the Stiehl blade into his sister Tarsha's back, but it turns out she is only a magical illusion and Tavo is quickly disarmed. In the scuffle, the evil Clizia Porse retrieves the Stiehl Blade and escapes. The druid Drisker Arc fashions a magical collar and places it around Tavo's neck so he cannot call up the Wishsong. Drisker decides to consult the dead at the Hadeshorn to see what to do about Clizia Porse. He tries to summon Allanon, but ends up summoning Grianne Ohmsford. She is still trapped in The Forbidding, but has figured out how to communicate through the Hadeshorn. She agrees to help him if he will return her to the young woman she was before she entered into the service of the Mother Tanequil. He agrees, and she tells him that Shea Ohmsford is the key. Using the Elfstones, they find Shea.\nCor d’Amphere, king of the Skaar, arrives at the front lines of the Skaar Invasion and relieves his daughter Ajin d’Amphere of command, sending her back to Skaarsland. Cor commands Ajin's second in command and confidant (who secretly loves her), Kol’Dre, known as The Penetrator, to stay with him. Cor meets with the Federation Prime Minister, Ketter Vause, and demands to keep the lands they have conquered. Vause agrees and has his assistant Belladrin Rish draw up the agreement and take it to the Skaar king. Later, Belladrin Rish goes to the Dwarves and enlists Battenhyle, Lakodan, and a company of dwarves to come to the Skaar battlefront with their machine, The Revealer, in exchange for a release from conscripting of dwarves into the Federation army for 50 years.\nEn route to Skaarsland the ship carrying Ajin crashes. Jor’ Alt, commanded by Ajin's step-mother (The Pretender), attempts to assassinate Ajin, but she kills him. She is then rescued by Darcon (Dar) Leah and Tarsha. Ajin pursues Dar romantically, and they begin to fall in love.\nClizia Porse sneaks into the Skaar camp and makes an alliance with the king. She convinces him to send her and a compliment of soldiers to claim Paranor for Skaarsland, but the guardian kills her guards and chases her from the keep. She knows now that Drisker has convinced the guardian that she is a threat, and no longer a druid. She decides she must destroy Drisker to reverse this. She returns to the Skaar king and suggests that she will kill the Elf king, Gerrendren Elessedil, and the Federation Prime Minister, Ketter Vause, to distract them from the war effort, giving the Skaar an advantage in battle.\n\tShea Ohmsford rescues Tindall from the Assidian Deep prison, but they are tracked back to their hideout by Commander Zakonis. Seelah rescues them, killing Zakonis’ men, but leaving him bound. Shea decides to accompany Rocan Arneas and his cousin Sartren Longlet aboard the giant airship Behemoth carrying the weather changing machine, Annabelle. He learns about Annabelle from Tindall during their journey. Shea breaks his promise not to reveal Annabelle and tells Drisker Arc about it. Drisker demands that Behemoth take Annabelle to Skaarsland to try to end the long winter that has caused them to invade the Four Lands in search of a warmer home. Rocan reluctantly agrees.\nDrisker, Tarsha, and Tavo return to the Hadeshorn, where Drisker tries to summon Grianne again, but this time summons Allanon. Allanon confirms that Grianne's advice was sound and then has Drisker anoint Tarsha with water from the Hadeshorn (thought to be deadly). They do not tell her why. They then return to Paranor to use the waters of the Scrye Bowl to find Clizia Porse, finding her in Arborlon, the Elven Capital City. Tavo is visited by Fluken and has a meltdown.\nClizia Porse sneaks into the Palace at Arborlon and beheads the Elven king with the Stiehl Blade, but the use of the magic leaves her drained. After several days of recovery, she sneaks into the Federation Camp to assassinate the Prime Minister, but Drisker anticipated this after the assassination of the Elven king and stops her, but she escapes. Tavo finds her but is unable to use the Wishsong to stop her since he is still wearing Drisker's collar.\nFearing for his life, Ketter Vause orders an attack on the Skaar encampment, only to find it abandoned. The Skaar flank the Federation and attack while the majority of the Federation force is deployed. The Federation use the Reveals, which sprays a neon-like liquid on the invisible Skaar soldiers, revealing them. The Skaar had learned of the Revealer in advance, so they wear cloaks to catch most of the liquid, and then discard the cloaks. It makes the Revealer less effective, but still renders the Skaar soldiers invisibility less effective. The Federation prevails in battle.\nMeanwhile, the Behemoth suffers damage in a storm and is forced to land on an Island called Nambizi, one of the nine islands off the coast of Nambia, according to Ajin. Dar and Ajin are attacked by a giant rhinoceros, that is called off by a black boy, who then signals for them to leave. Shea hears this story and sneaks off at night to meet the boy. They exchange names, the boy is called Borshawk, but a language barrier prohibits further communication. Shea says \"friends,\" and conveys the meaning by shaking his hand. Later that nite, Behemoth is attacked by black men riding giant bat-like creatures. Ajin and Dar board a Sprint and counterattack. The attackers flee, while Ajin and Dar pursue, but their Sprint loses power and crashes near a fleet of enemy ships.\nCor d’Amphere asks Kol’Dre to assassinate Ketter Vause in exchange for Ajin's hand in marriage. Kol agrees, and kills Vause, but is then killed by Belladrin Rish who says \"Cor d’Amphere thanks you greatly for your service,\" revealing that she is a Skaar spy.\nClizia Porse sets a trap for Drisker Arc at the Cleeg Hold, and brews Nightshade to send him to the Forbidding. She succeeds. She then attacks Tarsha, sending her falling from a cliff. Freed from his collar, Tavo attacks with the Wishsong, but Clizia counterattacks, and slits his throat. As the novel closes, it is revealed that the use of the Nightshade exchanged Drisker with a Jachyra from the Forbidding.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe characters are:\n\nAjin d’Amphere is a princess from the island nation of Skaarsland near the continent of Eurodia, and daughter of Cor d’Amphere.\nAllanon is a Druid who has been dead for hundreds of years and resides in the Netherworld.\nAnnabelle is a machine that can allegedly change the weather.

        "content": "Dimitar Borisov Glavchev (Bulgarian: Димитър Борисов Главчев, born 15 August 1963) is a Bulgarian politician who is the current caretaker Prime Minister of Bulgaria. A political independent, he is also the Head of the Chamber of Audit, currently on unpaid leave. He was previously a member of the GERB party and served as Member of the National Assembly from 2009 to 2021. In 2017, he shortly served as Chairman of the National Assembly.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nHe was born on 15 August 1962, in Sofia. In 1981, he graduated from SOU \"Dobriy Voynik\" (then named \"Mikhail Kalinin\"). He graduated from the University of National and World Economy (then known as '\"High Research Institute\" Karl Marx') in 1987, with the professional qualification of \"economist-accountant\". He received a second degree from the university in \"International Economic Relations\".\nGlavchev worked as a professional accountant for around 30 years, working 20 of them as an independent auditor.\n\n\n== Parliamentary Activity ==\nGlavchev was elected in 2009, being part of the GERB parliamentary group in the 41st National Assembly. He served a further 5 terms as MP, retiring after the 46th National Assembly.\nIn his tenure as MP, Glavchev served in the Budget and Finance Committee. In this capacity, he helped develop the \"Law on the Chamber of Audit\" in 2010.\nIn 2011, he was appointed as deputy head of the GERB Parliamentary Group.\nDuring the tenure of the 43rd National Assembly, he was made deputy chairman of the assembly, temporarily leading assembly sessions during the absence of incumbent Chairman Tsetska Tsacheva.\nIn the 44th National Assembly, he headed the interparliamentary Bulgarian delegation to PACE.\nGlavchev did not seek re-election as an MP during the 2021 November Bulgarian legislative elections.\n\n\n=== Chairman of the National Assembly ===\nGlavchev served as Chairman of the 44th National Assembly between 18 April and 17 November 2017.\nGlavchev resigned on 17 November, after a scandal with BSP leader, Korneliya Ninova, whom he forced to leave a session for 'insulting' Prime Minister Boyko Borisov in a declaration.\n\n\n== Chairman of the Chamber of Audit ==\nOn 12 July 2023 Glavchev was nominated for Head of the Chamber of Audit by the GERB-SDS parliamentary group. He was elected to the position by the National Assembly with the support of 148 MPs on 26 July. On 31 July, Glavchev officially began his 7-year term, being welcomed by Acting Head of the Chamber of Audit, Goritsa Granzharova-Kozharova.\nGlavchev's election was surrounded by some controversy, due to the fact that his predecessor, Tsvetan Tsvetkov, was unconstitutionally removed from his position.\n\n\n== Caretaker Prime Minister ==\n\n\n=== Caretaker Government formation ===\nOn 28 March 2024, after the failure of government talks following the resignation of the Denkov Government, Glavchev attended a meeting with President Rumen Radev. According to the newly passed constitutional amendments, Glavchev, as the Head of the Chamber of Audit, was eligible to be selected by the President to serve as caretaker Prime Minister.\nThe following day, Radev officially announced Glavchev as the caretaker Prime Minister-designate, inviting him for another meeting on 30 March.\nOn 30 March, Radev officially presented Glavchev with the responsibility of forming a caretaker government, with Glavchev lamenting that while the position may be difficult for him, he will aim to form a politically neutral caretaker cabinet. In comments to the press following the meeting, he outlined that he will look for experts within the Ministries who had a \"good reputation within society\" and insisted that his cabinet would remain politically neutral and committed to \"Euroatlanticist\" values.\nAccording to a bill passed by the National Assembly on 29 March, Glavchev would be allowed to take an unpaid leave from the Chamber of Audit and then regain the position following his premiership.\nOn 5 April, Glavchev presented his Caretaker Cabinet prior during consultations with the Parliamentary Parties. The Consultations were not attended by BSP, and PP-DB left the consultations due to Glavchev's choice to keep incumbent Kalin Stoyanov as Minister of Interior in a caretaker capacity, as well as the appointment of other potentially controversial figures. Following the meeting, Glavchev characterised the choice of Stoyanov as \"difficult\", but justified it with the recent resignation of the Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, Zhivko Kotsev, leaving few options within the present administration.\nHe was sworn in as caretaker prime minister in the presence of National Assembly on 9 April, with his mandate lasting until the conclusion of the government formations negotiations following the upcoming parliamentary elections. During a joint press conference with outgoing Prime Minister, Nikolai Denkov, he vowed to insure fair elections and stability in Bulgaria. \n\n\n=== Caretaker Prime Minister Tenure ===\nDuring his first cabinet meeting, Glavchev declared that insuring that free and fair elections took place was the main task of the Caretaker Cabinet. \nGlavchev became the first Caretaker Prime Minister in modern Bulgarian history to participate in a European Council meeting, with the role being previously fulfiled by the President of Bulgaria in periods with a Caretaker Cabinet. He also became the Prime Minister to have the largest amount of advisors, appointing 23.\nOnly a week after the appointment of the cabinet, Prime Minister Glavchev requested the removal of two Ministers: the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stefan Dimitrov, and the Minister of Foods and Agriculture, Kiril Vutev, both of whom he accused of not properly fulfilling their roles. In their place, he proposed GERB MP, Daniel Mitov, for Minister of Foreign Affairs, and head of the State Fund \"Agriculture\", Georgi Tahov, for Minister of Agriculture.\nAfter President Rumen Radev announced his opposition to the changes, Glavchev argued that it was the President's \"constitutional duty\" to approve the changes. In a follow up statement, he made clear that he was ready to further discuss the re-shuffle, however insisted that the political responsibility for the two ministers in questions would shift to the President.\nOn the 19th of April, Glavchev met with the President to discuss the proposed reshuffle, following which he confirmed that no agreement had been reached and the current ministers would continue to implement their duties. A few hours after the meeting, Mitov declared that he did not intend to become Caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs, with Glavchev confirming that he did not have another candidate for the position prepared. On the 20th of April, Glavchev announced that he had proposed himself for the position of Caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Early Rain Covenant Church (traditional Chinese: 秋雨聖約教會; simplified Chinese: 秋雨圣约教会; pinyin: Qiūyǔ Shèngyuē Jiàohuì; Sichuanese romanization: Tsiu-ü Shen-io Chiao-hue; lit. 'Autumn Rain Covenant Church') is a house church within the Reformed Presbyterian tradition based in the Sichuanese provincial capital city of Chengdu, southwestern China. It was established as Early Rain Blessings Fellowship by Pastor Wang Yi and his wife, Jiang Rong, in their own home in Chengdu, in April 2005. The small congregation has evolved into a house church three years later, and since then it had been variously known as Early Rain Blessings Church, Early Rain Reformed Church and Early Rain Reformed Presbyterian Church before adopting its current name.\n\n\n== Name ==\nAccording to a pastoral letter from Elder Li Yingqiang, the native name of the church, \"Autumn Rain\", comes from Psalm 84:6: \"When they walk through the Valley of Weeping, it will become a place of refreshing springs. The autumn rains will clothe it with blessings.\"\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nThe first Protestant missionaries to reach Sichuan were Griffith John of the London Missionary Society and Alexander Wylie of the British and Foreign Bible Society, when the two, in 1868, visited many of the most important towns and markets, including the capital, Chengdu. However, this journey was a \"prospecting trip\" without establishing mission stations. The first settled mission work had not been opened up until 1877.Among the twenty or so missionary societies working in this province before 1950, the London Missionary Society was the only one of a Reformed background. Griffith John, a member of the Congregational church, returned in 1888 to take up permanent work in Sichuan. Thomas Torrance, a Scottish Presbyterian minister serving under the American Bible Society, was a missionary in Chengdu from 1910 to 1934.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2005, three years before the establishment of what would become Early Rain Blessings Church, a Bible study group was received at Wang Yi's home in Chengdu. This small group, later known as Early Rain Blessings Fellowship, has evolved into a house church and was formally established as Early Rain Blessings Church on May 25, 2008, just thirteen days after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.In late May 2008, the Fellowship invited Peng Qiang, pastor of Chengdu Enfu Reformed Gospel Church, to ordain Wang Yi, Zhou Maojian and Chen Zhongdong as elders. In July, an office space was leased to the church as their first public sanctuary. This was followed by the distribution of self-printed Sunday bulletins. According to Meng, a former Three-Self Church member, who joined Early Rain Church in December 2008, \"they were a very different group from a Three-Self church\", they prayed for the June Fourth victims and repented on behalf of the country.On July 14, 2009, 63 church members were forbidden to enter Early Rain's leased apartment by the subdistrict office at West Wenmiao Street. A second obstruction of their worship occurred the next Sunday, the service had to be moved into a nearby hotel conference room, where fifty church members voted to elect Chen, Wang and Zhou as their first board of three elders, and several deacons. In September 2009, with the help of a few resourceful members, the church purchased a commercial space on the 19th floor of Jiangxin Building, in the district of Qingyang. The same year, Wang Huasheng joined Early Rain as one of its full-time ministers. By May 2010, the church had 190 attendees; membership grew to over 250 at the end of July.As the church grew larger, several other house churches in Chengdu have joined Early Rain over time to form the Presbytery of West China Reformed Churches. This has led to other institutional extensions such as a kindergarten, a day school, a seminary (Western China Covenant Theological Seminary), and a liberal arts college for classical Christian education (Western China Covenant College). As of December 2018, the membership of Early Rain Covenant Church was over 500. An ABC News report on December 15, 2018 stated that the original church had 600 to 700 members, with approximately 200 attending its \"branch\" churches. These numbers did not include catechumens.\n\n\n== Belief ==\nDuring an interview with Wang Yi conducted by Yu Jie in 2011, the interviewee stated that, Early Rain Covenant Church acknowledges the four formal creeds: Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Chalcedonian Creed and Athanasian Creed, and follows the Belgic Confession and the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\n\n== Persecution ==\nEarly Rain Covenant Church has been subjected to repeated persecution, which culminated in December 2018 with a massive crackdown by Chengdu police. 100 church members, including Pastor Wang Yi and his wife, Jiang Rong, were detained. The church has been banned and its properties were confiscated by the government. In December 2019, Wang Yi, who challenged the government's sinicization of the gospel in his 95 Thesis, was sentenced to nine years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\" and \"illegal business activity\".On August 14, 2022, Chengdu police raided a 50-member Early Rain Sunday gathering inside a teahouse in the district of Wuhou, and detained the leader. They were accused of holding an \"illegal gathering\" of a \"banned organization\".\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nIn addition to Wang Yi, other notable members of Early Rain Covenant Church include:\n\nElder Li Yingqiang, one of the founders of the Liren Rural Library (NGO), who was detained on December 19, 2023, for eight hours, by local police in Deyang.\nPreacher Dai Zhichao, who has been constantly monitored and harassed. He was jailed after a police raid on Sunday meeting on August 22, 2021.\nRan Yunfei, a writer and a high-profile democracy activist from Chongqing, who was baptized by Pastor Wang Yi at Early Rain Covenant Church. He was charged with \"inciting subversion of state power\" in 2011, and had been jailed for six months.\nFu Hailu, an itinerant worker from Xuanhan County, northeastern Sichuan, who was detained on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\" in 2016, for selling liquor with references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre on the label (June 4th Liquor Bottle Case). He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. His wife and son are also members of Early Rain Church.\nRen Ruiting, who, after the 2018 crackdown, first fled to Taiwan, and then to the United States. She was invited to speak at the 2022 International Religious Freedom Summit.\n\n\n== See also ==\nShouwang Church – a house church in Beijing, north China\nAntireligious campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJohnson, Ian (2017).

        "content": "Various countries and international organizations have influenced the Myanmar civil war (2021–present) to various extents.\n\n\n== List by country and region ==\n\n\n=== United Nations ===\n\nIn June 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution asking member states to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar. Two hundred international organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have continued to press the UN and its member states to adopt a global arms embargo.\n\n\n=== ASEAN and East Timor ===\n\nASEAN has blocked Myanmar from participating in regional summits since the 2021 coup. For instance, during the 2022 ASEAN summit, Myanmar's chair remained empty. This condition persisted until New Zealand invited the junta to two ASEAN summits hosted in Wellington in April 2024. ASEAN member-states have not taken a consistent, coordinated approach with respect to the ongoing civil war, due to internal divisions. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are strongly opposed to the military junta. Sasa, a cabinet minister with NUG, stated the group had failed to act even after the SAC \"blatantly disregarded ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus\", which stipulates an end to the violence, undermining the bloc's standing.\nThailand was a key ally of the junta; former Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha used back-channel contacts in mid-2021 to shape Thailand's diplomatic options, especially as these related to ASEAN. On 30 June 2022, when the Myanmar Air Force allegedly violated Thai airspace, Thailand scrambled a defence attache. Later, Prayuth said that the incident was \"not a big deal\". After the 2023 Thai general election, the new Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has shown support for the military's Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement urging all parties in Myanmar to stay on the path for peace and stability. In April 2024, Thavisin remarked in an interview with Reuters that the Tatmadaw's power was weakening, and expressed support for stability in Myanmar, which borders Thailand.\nSingapore initially emphasised the importance of separating business from politics, but subsequently became wary of doing business with Myanmar. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong described the use of lethal force in the suppression of anti-junta protestors as \"just not acceptable\" and \"disastrous\". In 2022, Lee continued supporting the exclusion of the military regime from ASEAN meetings until the regime cooperates on ASEAN's peace plans. Currently, Singapore does not recognise the military junta. During the war, Singapore has remained a major equipment supplier for the junta's weapons factories. Several Singapore-based firms have also served as intermediary companies for the junta, collectively shipping 254 million US dollars' worth of arms to the junta between 2021 and 2023.\nAs of December 2023, East Timor remains the only government to have openly expressed sympathies to the anti-regime forces in Myanmar. In August 2023, the State Administration Council expelled the East Timorese ambassador in retaliation for the East Timorese government meeting with the NUG.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n\nBangladesh recognizes the military junta, but does not support its actions, in part because the Rohingya genocide has led to around 1 million Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh. In the first week of September 2020, Bangladeshi forces reported that the Tatmadaw started amassing troops and doing unusual buildups in three different locations on the Bangladesh–Myanmar border. As a consequence, Bangladesh's foreign minister summoned Myanmar's ambassador, calling for him to desist from such activities and to work for mutually beneficial relations between the two countries. As a result, Bangladesh revealed that is ready to face any situation, deploying the 34 Border Guard Bangladesh battalion on the border with Myanmar. This battalion asked their counterparts to arrange a flag meeting but they received no response.\nIn August 2022, Bangladesh strongly protested territorial violations when two Myanmar Army mortar shells hit a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and when a junta helicopter entered Bangladeshi airspace and fired a shell. Aung Kyaw Moe, the ambassador of Myanmar to Bangladesh, was summoned by the Bangladesh ministry of foreign affairs four times in 2022 due to multiple violations of Bangladesh's airspace in the Naikhongchhari border area by the Myanmar Army.\nOn 3 February 2024, intensifying clashes between the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw in Rakhine state lead to mortar shells and bullets landing in Bangladesh, injuring civilians and prompting local villagers to flee. Bangladeshi authorities closed schools and madrasas in border villages. As tensions increased, Bangladesh strengthened the Bangladesh Police and Bangladesh Coast Guard to be stationed to resist any intrusion through the borders. Three hundred and twenty-seven Myanmar Border Guard Police personnel sought refuge in Bangladesh, where they were disarmed and sheltered by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB). Two days later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina instructed the Bangladesh Armed Forces and BGB to have patience regarding the situation in Myanmar. On 7 February BGB Director Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui recommended suspending the naval route to St. Martin's Island in Bangladesh due to the increasing border tensions, accordingly, sea travel to St. Martin's Island is indefinitely closed down by the district administration of Cox's Bazar from 10 February. On 8 February 2024, the Tatmadaw agreed to send a ship to take back the stranded BGP personnel in Bangladesh.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nSince the coup d'état, China and Russia have supported the military junta and have been its main arms suppliers. China is Myanmar's largest trading partner. China has also been accused of tacitly supporting the junta. China and Russia have blocked any substantive action against Myanmar's military at the United Nations Security Council, while the country's security forces have reportedly used Chinese and Russian-supplied weapons to perpetrate human rights violations.\nChinese support for the junta has led to a rise in popular anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar.\nIn December 2022, China's special envoy to Myanmar, Deng Xijun, engaged with the military junta in Naypyidaw. After his visit, the Burmese military pulled 30 battalions from the Northeastern Command, and redeployed them to launch major offensives against pro-democracy forces in other areas. However, concerns later grew over allegations of China no longer 'restraining' the influence of the insurgents, which some viewed as a response to the Burmese military's inaction over Chinese citizens being forced to work in scam centres in northern Shan state.\nChina is particularly sensitive to Western support for EAOs along the Burmese–Chinese border, and has moved to simultaneously support the military junta and powerful EAOs like the United Wa State Army, which has supported pro-democracy forces. In response to the BURMA Act passed by the United States in 2022, the Government of China increased diplomatic efforts to engage EAOs and the military junta, to protect Chinese business and geopolitical interests, though the country claimed that it does not intend to normalise relations with the military junta. Annual cross-border trade between China and Myanmar before the coup was estimated to over 5 billion (in U.S. dollars) annually.\nThe fact that the Three Brotherhood Alliance's Operation 1027 in late 2023 was carried out near the China–Myanmar border may indicate a shift in China's stance. The status quo in that area had previously been guaranteed by a China-mediated ceasefire. This change in stance was attributed by analysts to concerns about cyber-scam centers, the pursuit of favorable concessions from the junta on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, and the opportunity to influence the PDF in light of evolving dynamics between NUG and EAO groups. On 13 November 2023, China issued arrest warrants for junta-aligned Ming Xuecheng and his family members for their involvement in online scamming operations. According to The Diplomat, this move signaled China's \"tacit support for the removal of the Kokang SAZ's leadership\". China issued more arrest warrants in December for ten high-ranking Kokang officials and business leaders for being members of \"family criminal gangs\", including the founder of the Kokang region's Border Guard Forces, Bai Xuoqian. The junta signalled its unhappiness at China's role in Operation 1027 and allowed anti-China demonstrations outside the embassy in Yangon in November.\nThe International Crisis Group said China seeks to maintain relations with all the main parties to preserve its leverage and stop geopolitical rivals from capitalising on turmoil.\nOn 6 December 2023, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged to \"achieve domestic reconciliation\" and \"continue the political transformation process\" in Myanmar during a meeting with Myanmar's Foreign Minister Than Swe. On 4 January 2024, which is Myanmar's Independence Day, China opted to remain silent and did not send a congratulatory message, unlike prior years when Chinese president Xi Jinping personally sent such congratulatory messages.\n\n\n=== India ===\nIndia, which represents Myanmar's fourth-largest export market and fifth-largest import partner, has continued a business-as-usual approach to cross-border relations and continues to recognize the military junta. State-owned and private Indian companies, including Yantra India, supplied arms and raw materials to the junta, enabling the military to conduct surveillance and boost its artillery and missile stocks. A 2023 UN report alleges that these arms were likely to be used in the commission of international crime and that companies have avoided sanctions through shell companies. The India–Myanmar border is 1,021 miles (1,643 km) in length and runs from the tripoint with China in the north to the tripoint with Bangladesh in the south. Amid escalating clashes in Rakhine, India urged its citizens to avoid travel to Rakhine State in early February 2024.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\n\nRussia has embraced deeper ties with the Burmese military junta, as the civil war has progressed. Russia has provided materiel, military training for over 50 Myanmar Air Force pilots, and diplomatic backing to the regime. Min Aung Hlaing has visited Russia several times, personally meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in September 2022. The military junta backed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia was among the few countries to send a congratulatory message to the junta on Myanmar's Independence Day. In March 2024, Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, saw Russia still being the number one source of weapons for the junta.\n\n\n=== European Union and NATO countries ===\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union have, in response to the ongoing violence, sanctioned individuals and organisations associated with the Burmese military. However, the effectiveness of these sanctions has been undermined by poor coordination among the governments and the lack of sanctions against high-impact targets. As of February 2023, only 13% of Burmese sanctions targets were sanctioned by the US, the UK and the EU. Further, the UK and US governments have not sanctioned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is the country's largest source of foreign currency. Burmese sanctions targets have also evaded international sanctions by channeling funds through affiliated firms. For instance, a subsidiary of Myanma Economic Holdings Limited, a sanctioned military-owned conglomerate, created a new affiliated firm to import palm oil.\nOn 23 December 2022, the US Congress passed and US President Joe Biden signed the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act (BURMA Act) into law, which provides the president with additional discretionary authority to make policy changes with respect to Myanmar. The law enables the president to provide \"non-lethal assistance\" to NUG, EAOs, PDFs, and pro-democracy organisations, to provide humanitarian aid to the country, to impose new sanctions, including on MOGE, and enables the secretary of state to assist civilian and international entities with identifying and documenting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Myanmar.\nAmerican foreign policy director Derek Chollet claimed the U.S. has provided nearly $400 million USD in non-lethal aid to pro-democracy groups in Myanmar. He has already met with NUG's Foreign Minister Zin Mar Aung and several armed group leaders, including representatives from the Kachin Independence Army.\nA passage from The Diplomat thought the U.S. would gain an enormous strategic advantage vis-à-vis China if the U.S. provided just a little more support to Myanmar's resistance forces, hasting the downfall of the junta and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Danish Brotherhood in America Headquarters is a building located in the Midtown neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Danish Brotherhood in America was an ethnic fraternal organization and insurance company.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Danish residents of Omaha established the benevolent society in 1882. In 1966, the group had the office building built as the headquarters for their life insurance program.\nIn 2014, the group sold the building just before their insurance division merged with Woodmen of the World to form the Assured Life Association. Attorney Mike Goodman, with a partner owned the building from 1994 to 2015. Dundee Bank bought the building in 2015 for the loan processing center and renovated the building. In 2016, the National Register of Historic Places listed the building based on the distinctive architecture.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe organization hired Omaha architect Edward Sessinghaus to design the two-story structure, based on his extensive experience designing distinctive buildings, such as the Sokol Auditorium. By this point he was semi-retired, so Teig & Johnson was the architectal firm of record. He used a postmodern interpretation of the National Romantic style to emphasize the group's Scandinavian heritage.\nThe exterior has a hipped roof made of red terra cotta tiles and ashlar stone walls with a water table encircling the base of the building. Five bays are created by stepped parapet style dormer windows. There are carved stones with the organization's crest over the front door and a stylized \"DB\" between the windows.\nThe most prominent feature on the exterior of building is a green screw-shaped spire on the roof. The copper feature is inspired by the Børsen building, a 17th-centry stock exchange in Copenhagen, Denmark, where a more elaborate spire is meant to represent intertwined dragon tails.\nThe interior includes a main boardroom with wood-paneled walls and ceiling with intricately carved moldings. The foyer has a terrazzo floor with Tennessee marble walls and a mirrored ceiling.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nColumbia Hall (Dannebrog, Nebraska)\nWashington Hall (Seattle)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Douglas County, Nebraska\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Livable California is a NIMBY group in California known for advocating against increased housing supply and for local control. The organization disputes the existence of the California housing shortage. The organization was founded by Marin County-based activist Susan Kirsch.Livable California was founded in 2018 by Marin County-based activist and former teacher Susan Kirsch and former oil and gas executive Rick Hall of San Francisco. They organized in opposition to Senator Scott Wiener’s housing development bill SB 827, helping to defeat it. The group also opposed subsequent iterations of the bill, such as SB 50, which would permit fourplexes in most neighborhoods exclusively zoned for single-family housing and mid-rises near public transit stations.Susan Kirsch started in anti-housing activism when she successfully prevented a 20-unit apartment building in her neighborhood. Kirsch self-describes as a proponent for \"slow growth\", and disputes that California is experiencing a housing crisis. Other members of Livable California describe themselves as proponents for \"sensible\" development, \"smart growth\" or \"preservationists\". What unifies Livable California members is opposition to high-density housing development and support for single-family-exclusive zoning.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was an apostle to Beka I Jaqeli, so that he could send the Prince George (the future George V) to be brought up with him. The chronicler mentions Shahnshah a member of the Mongol punitive expedition against King David VIII. \"Atabeg-Amirspasalar Shahansha\" is mentioned in one of the Armenian inscriptions of 1310 AD, and only as Atabeg in the Georgian-language epitaph on the tombstone of his brother, Atabeg Vahram.\n\n\n=== His wife Kuandze ===\nThe wife of Shahnshah II Zakarian was named Kuandze and was the daughter of the Armenian Princes Khoshak and Shams al-Din Juvayni, an Il-Khanid Sahib Divan, \"the highest ranking officials in the hierarchical system of the II-khanid state\", responsible for finance. Khuandze is known from an inscription at Ani, on the mosque Abul Mā’maran.\nKuandze is also known from an inscription at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ani:\n\nIn 769 (ie 1320), by the mercy of God, I Khouandze, wife of Atabek Shahnchah (II) who died in this year, and caused us and our eastern country a great affliction, me, his wife, daughter of Chamchadin Sahip-Divan and of the Baroness Khorichah, (great-) granddaughter of the Atabek Ivane (I), as well as my son Zacharia (IV), for the salvation of the soul of the master and for the longevity of my brothers, we have waived in our heritage town of Ani the right to the counting of cows and donkeys, as well as on large and small entry permits. Anyone who attempts to put an obstacle to our dispositions, whether he is Armenian, Georgian or Mongolian, may he be judged and condemned by God, may he share the fate of Satan and may he be his co-inhabitant of the gehenna; let the Georgian be excommunicated and cursed; the Mongol be covered with shame and guilt before the prophets glorified in God; but may those who observe our provisions until the end of the world be blessed by Almighty God. Let anyone who opposes it be anathema, like Judas and like Cain. These favors and this charity were established  under the goverment of Baron Lip. Ptough the scribe.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Los Notables (lit. 'The Notables') were a group of Venezuelan intellectuals formed in 1990 and headed by Arturo Uslar Pietri critical of the second government of Carlos Andrés Pérez who proposed the implementation of several public reforms. The group would later demand the proposals implementation, demand the resignation or dismissal of Carlos Andrés and would criticize other state institutions, including the Venezuelan Supreme Court and judicial system, the Supreme Electoral Council, the Congress and the political parties. It was later suggested that members of the group may have been involved in subsequent conspiracies against the government of Carlos Andres, including the first and second attempted coup d'état in Venezuela in 1992. Rafael Caldera and Ramón Escovar Salom, Venezuela's attorney general, are also usually included in the group.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter the 1970's oil boom, the Venezuelan economy entered into crisis as a result of the indebtedness incurred by the first government of Carlos Andrés Pérez. Starting with the 1980's fall of oil prices, a gradual economic slowdown began while the Venezuelan State increased its revenues and expenses, which caused a devaluation of the currency in 1983. From then on, the economic policies of the governments of Luis Herrera Campíns and Jaime Lusinchi were not able to stop the inflationary spirals, generating distrust in investments and loss of credibility in the national currency. Some of the measures applied by these governments to stop the structural effects were the establishment of the Differential Exchange Rate Regime (RECADI), during the Herrera Campins government, and a price control, during the Lusinchi government, measures that resulted in administrative corruption and black markets of foreign currency and goods. Carlos Andrés Pérez, elected as Democratic Action's candidate on 4 December 1988, began a series of liberalizing economic measures in response to the crisis known as El Gran Viraje.\nDuring his presidency, personal animosity towards Carlos Andres from some sectors of society joined the rejection of his economic measures, causing an agreement between the right and the political left in their rejection of Pérez. Carlos Andrés served as Minister of Internal Affairs during the government of Rómulo Betancourt, where he played an important role against the anti-guerrilla struggle, which had generated resentment in sectors of the left. During the first government of Andrés Pérez, Ramón Escovar Salom was removed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Democratic Action was also involved in the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'état against the government of Isaías Medina Angarita, where Arturo Uslar Pietri had held the position of Minister of Internal Affairs. Said coup thwarted Uslar Pietri's political aspirations, including the possibility of becoming President of Venezuela.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 10 August 1990, a group of intellectuals, including Arturo Uslar Pietri, organized as a civil association and published an open letter addressed to President Carlos Andrés Pérez, proposing electoral and judicial reforms. The group would later become known as \"Los Notables\" and the signatories were as follows:\n\nOn 25 August, Arturo Uslar Pietri proposed the creation of the figure of a prime minister, and on 3 December, the group of Los Notables published a second document in which they complained about the Executive and the political parties for not taking into account their demand for uninominal elections and judicial reform.\nOn 30 July 1991, Los Notables publish a third document demanding the satisfaction of their petitions as a response to the national crisis. In an interview to El Nacional, Uslar Pietri declared on 17 November that if answers were not given to the Venezuelan crisis, a coup d'état could take place. On 1 December, Uslar Pietri again declares in RCTV's Primer Plano talk show that \"it would be idiotic to deny the possibility of a coup\".\nBy 1992 the group had gained significant renown and prestige, aided by their academic careers. It was later suggested that members of the group could have been involved in subsequent conspiracies against the government of Carlos Andres, including the first and second coup attempts of 1992. After the 4 February coup d'état attempt, Los Notables proceeded to press for greater demands, including criticism of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Venezuelan judicial system, the Supreme Electoral Council (demanding judicial and electoral reform that included uninational voting), political parties, Congress and the government of Carlos Andrés. After the coup, Uslar Pietri declared that \"it would be very serious to think\" that the military rebels were just \"madmen who threw the parade\" because with other Venezuelans they shared \"a sovereign dislike for the way the government functioned\".\nIn an extraordinary session of the National Congress on the occasion of the coup d'état attempt, then Senator Rafael Caldera made the following speech:\n\nA confidential report prepared by the National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP) in March 1992 for President Carlos Andrés linked Arturo Uslar Pietri and Douglas Bravo to participate in the coup attempt. Despite its confidentiality, it was widely published by the local press and caused discomfort among those mentioned in the conspiracy, who denied any involvement. The connection with the intellectuals of the group of Los Notables was due to their coincidence in demanding the resignation of the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, which was raised in a public act at the Hilton Hotel after the coup, in the presence of Douglas Bravo, Francisco Prada Barasarte (Hugo Chávez's connection) and Tarek William Saab.\nAfter the first coup attempt, Carlos Andrés created the Consultative Council to recommend new policies. Several of the proposals made by the Council included proposals from the group of Los Notables.\nAfterwards, one of the leaders of the second coup attempt on 27 November 1992, Francisco Visconti, stated from his refuge in Iquitos, Peru, that the conspirators were more inclined to approach some civilians for this attempt and considered governing with some members of Los Notables. However, Visconti denied that Uslar Pietri was involved in the movement.\nOne of the members of Los Notables, José Vicente Rangel, denounced in his television program the alleged embezzlement in the use of a secret fund of Carlos Andrés Pérez. The accusation was picked up by Attorney General Ramón Escovar Salom, whom Pérez had appointed to the position, in spite of the existing hostility between them.\nThe group of Notables insisted on the seriousness of the country's crisis and the need for Carlos Andres' resignation to allow for \"lasting\" solutions until his dismissal in 1993. In March 1993, Attorney General Ramón Escovar Salom filed a request for a pre-trial of merit against President Andrés Pérez for the crime of \"fraudulent embezzlement\" and \"malfeasance\" of 250 million bolívares of a secret item for the management of which he was responsible. On 20 May 1993, the report requested by the Supreme Court of Justice to Chief Justice Gonzalo Rodríguez Corro was made public, declaring the request for a pre-trial on merit to be admissible. The following day, on 21 May, the National Congress authorized the trial, impeaching Carlos Andres from the presidency. During the trial it was revealed that the money had been used for international aid to President Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua. The trial had several irregularities. In an article in the Diario de Caracas in 1993, it was pointed out that the investigation was flawed at the beginning, that its motivations were political, that the first decisions were dictated under pressure and that fundamental guarantees were disregarded.\nBeing interviewed by Venezuelan historian Agustín Blanco Muñoz in his book \"Yo sigo acusando! Habla CAP\", Carlos Andrés Pérez blames the group for his dismissal and declares that they were motivated by revenge for having removed them from power in 1945.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaracazo\nFebruary 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt\nNovember 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt\n1945 Venezuelan coup d'état\n\n\n== References ==",

Svitzers Bjergnings Entreprise. In 1876–1916, he was a board member (from 1890 as chairman) of the marine insurance company De private Assurandeurer.

        "content": "The siege of Enna or Castrogiovanni was launched by the Aghlabids against the important Byzantine city of Enna in 859. The Aghlabid forces managed to capture the city.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nFollowing the fall of Palermo in 831, the key to Byzantine defense became the fortified city of Castrogiovanni (modern-day Enna), governed by Theodotus. The city is on a high mountain, dominating all neighboring heights. Aiming to capture the city, as it was the seat of the Byzantine government of Sicily. Castrogiovanni was accessible by two tortuous and narrow gorges.\nA party of Arabs whom the governor, Abbas bin al-Fadhl, had sent to ravage the outskirts of Enna. They managed to capture a Greek prisoner. Abbas ordered him to be executed. The prisoner begged for mercy in exchange for helping them capture Enna, and Abbas agreed to this offer. The Byzantine garrison did not expect any attack and minimized their defenses.\nAbbas, with a cavalry force of 2,000, headed towards Castrogiovanni. Taking advantage of the darkness, Abbas dispatched a contingent under his uncle, Rabah, to a secret passage the prisoner had told them about. An aqueduct leads to the center of Castrogiovanni. The Arabs entered the aqueduct, then proceeded to kill the defenders of the city and open the gates for Abbas.\nThe city fell on January 24. The Arabs captured immense wealth and many prisoners, and part of them were sent to the Abbasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil. Abbas ordered the construction of a mosque to celebrate this victory in the palace of the Patricians.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe capture of Castrogiovanni destroyed the Byzantine power in Sicily and forced them to relocate their seat to Syracuse. Due to this defeat, the Byzantine emperor, Michael III, dispatched a navy of 300 ships to rescue Castrogiovanni under the command of Constantine Kontomytes. The Byzantine Navy suffered a crushing defeat and lost 100 of their ships.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nTony Jaques (2006), Dictionary of Battles and Sieges, A Guide to 8,500 Battles from Antiquity Through the Twenty-first Century [3 Volumes].[1]\nAlexander A.

        "content": "Al-Walid ibn Musab (Arabic: الوليد بن مصعب) is an ancient, legendary character who is claimed to be the biblical pharaoh who encountered Moses. His story was mainly transmitted by Arabian historians, some of which cite him as the sixth Pharaoh of Egypt with a foreign origin from the city of Balkh. \n\n\n== Name ==\nHis name is Al-Walid ibn Musab. His full name is disputed. Some sources give his full name as Al-Walid ibn Musab ibn ar-Rayyan ibn al-Halut ibn Qaran ibn 'Amr ibn Amliq, which gives him an Amalekite descent. On the other hand, Tabari names him as Al-Walid ibn Musab ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Namir.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n\n=== First version ===\nAl-Walid ibn Musab was a man from Khorasan, who was lame and had a beard seven inches long. He originally worked as a perfumer. However, debts accumulated on him, forcing him to leave his country and go to Egypt in search of a livelihood. In one way or another, he was able to sit on the throne of Egypt for 300 to 400 years, and he lived a very long life. This led to him becoming very arrogant, and soon his arrogance got the best of him, and he began telling the Egyptians that he was their supreme lord. The Egyptians naively believed him, and they began to worship him until the arrival of Moses.\n\n\n=== Second version ===\nAl-Walid ibn Musab was the brother of the previous Pharaoh, Qabus ibn Musab. When Qabus died, Al-Walid took the throne. Qabus was contemporary to the birth of Moses, while Al-Walid was contemporary to Moses' adulthood. He is the Pharaoh whom Moses first met upon his departure from Midan and return to Egypt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDaluka\nSurid ibn Salhouk\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Military Intelligence and Counterintelligence Law, popularly known as the Snitch Law (Spanish: Ley Sapo), was a law in Venezuela passed on 28 May 2008 during the government of Hugo Chávez that established the obligation for any person to comply with intelligence tasks if requested by the authorities, with the penalty of being prosecuted in case of refusal. The colloquial term in Spanish comes from popular Venezuelan slang in which a snitch is referred to as a \"sapo\" (Spanish for toad). After strong opposition against the law, Chávez repealed the law on 10 June 2008.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe law came into effect on 28 May 2008 after being published in Official Gazette No. 38,940. Said law established the obligation for any person to comply with intelligence and counter-intelligence work in case of being requested by the authorities, with the penalty of being prosecuted by the Public Ministry in case of refusal. It was approved by President Hugo Chávez after the National Assembly granted him the special legislative powers of the enabling law. The colloquial term for the law comes from Venezuelan slang in which a snitch is referred to as a \"sapo\" (Spanish for toad). The legislation was criticized by human rights organizations, which warned that it violated the constitution and could create a spy society, as well as by the Venezuelan student movement. The instrument was also compared to Cuba's informant networks and concern was expressed that the basic rights of suspects were denied, as was access to information. The non-governmental organization Foro Penal asked its annulment before the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.\nThe legislation led to protests against it, demanding its repeal, including on June 9 and 10 in Caracas, when multiple posters and effigies of toads with red berets were hung on the streets. Originally, Chavez and his cabinet justified the law as \"anti-coup\" and \"anti-imperialist\" for several days, but between June 7 and 8, Chávez initially declared that the law would be amended and subsequently announced its repeal on 10 June 2008; the repeal became effective in Official Gazette No. 38,949 in Decree No. 6156 just 14 days after its publication. Alfredo Romero, member of Foro Penal, stated that it was the first time in the history of Venezuela that an intelligence law existed and described the repeal as \"a triumph of the citizenry\". According to analysts, the purpose of the rectification was to regain the confidence of the public before the 2008 regional elections scheduled for November.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDespite the repeal of the Snitch Law, its main directives were gradually applied until culminating in the Articulation and Socio-Political Action Network, a social structure of espionage.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommittees for the Defense of the Revolution\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Church of the Holy Apostles, also Surp Arak’elots (Armenian: Սուրբ Առաքելոց եկեղեցի, Surb Arakelots yekeghets’i, \"Holy Apostles Church\"), is an important ecclesiastical monument of the ruined city of Ani, modern Turkey, on the border with Armenia.\nThe Church is composed in two parts: the church itself, now largely ruined, and the colonnated gavit in front of it, remaining in large part.\nThe remains of the gavit are clearly derived from Seljuk architectural designs.\n\n\n== The old Armenian Church (c. 1031) ==\nThe Church itself was built before 1031, date of a now lost inscription over the south entrance to the church, which was left by Abughamir Pahlavuni, a local Armenian prince. The plan of the church is essentially classical Armenian, forming an inscribed quadriconch, with the four cardinal axes each terminating in an apse. This type of plan was already kwown in the 6th century as a \"Cvari\" in Georgian and \"Hripsime\" in Armenian architecture. The church plan is also unique in that it is composed of five domes: four smaller domes in the corner chapels, and one large central dome. This slightly archaising architectural type is typical of earlier periods in Georgia and Armenia, and is found again in the Aghtamar, built in 915-921, the Otkhta Eklesia built in 960-980, or in the neighbouring King Gagik's church of St Gregory in Ani, built in 1001. Some surfaces were decorated with acanthus designs, another archaising trait.\nThe dedicatory inscription in Armenian on top of the entrance to the church reads:\n\nIn 480 (ie 1031), by the Grace of God, I, Abughamir, son of Vahram, Prince of Princes, have given the camp of Carnut to the Saint Apostoles, for the health and prolongation of the life of my brother Grigor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The gavit or narthex (1031-1215) ==\n\nHaving a colonnaded gavit or zhamatun at the entrance of a church, where it serves as an entrance room to the church and an assembly room or mausoleum, is a very common occurrence in Armenia, but the gavit of the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ani is very original in that it uses the styles of Seljuk architecture, rather than traditional Armenian medieval architecture. The gavit or zhamatun of the Church of the Holy Apostles was built later than the church (which was built around 1031, date of its first inscription), but before 1215, date of the earliest dated inscription visible on the walls of the gavit. It clearly derived from Seljuk architectural designs. The plan of the gavit is rather typical of Armenian medieval architecture, formed from two perpendicular pairs of arches leaving a central square vault with a central oculus. The central square vault is decorated with muqarnas stone \"stalactites\". Only the eastern face of the gavit remains. It is composed of a central porch with a muqarnas niche, flanked by four thin niches, triangular in section. The surface of the wall is decorated with a geometric interlace of eight-pointed stars.\nThe overall design of this wall is very similar to the design of the gate of the Mama Hatun mausoleum at Tercan, dated to c. 1200, and belonging to the Seljuk Saltukids dynasty. The vault design is also similar to that of the Bagnayr Monastery, which is dated by an inscription to 1201, supporting a date of around 1200 for the zhamatun of the Church of the Holy Apostoles.\nIn 1064, the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan took the city of Ani from the Byzantines (who had themselves taken it from the Bagratids barely twenty years earlier in 1045). The Seljuks then gave the city as a concession to their vassal, the Turkified Kurdic dynasty of the Shaddadids, in 1072. The first Shaddadid Bey of Ani, called Ebul Manuçehr (ruled c. 1072-1118) claimed to have rebuilt Ani, and therefore took the title \"Emir Ebu’l Muammeran\". He left was is called today the \"Emir Ebu’l Muammeran Complex\" at Ani. His son Shaddadid Şahinşah (r.1118–1124) built a small mosque at the center of the complex, between 1164 to 1200. The mosque was destroyed completely in 1917, and only some ruins of the minaret remain. The Georgians made multiple attempts to recover the city, until Queen Tamar succeeded in 1199 CE.\nThe style of the vault is considered as similar to that of the Menucihr Mosque at the entrance of the citadel at Ani, built between 1072 and 1086 by the first Shaddadids ruler of Ani Manuchihr ibn Shavur, suggesting broadly similar dates and circumstances. A stylistically similar structure also exists at Horomos Monastery, the \"Mausoleum of Aruits\", built in 1277 as indentified by an inscription.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Adoption of muqarnas styles in Armenian art ===\nArmenian architecture in the 13th century also made use of muqarnas decorative elements, and sometimes had complete muqarnas vaults with a central erdik or oculus, spurred by the influence of contemporary Islamic architecture. Examples of this can be found in the Geghard Monastery, Gandzasar Monastery, or Astvatsankal Monastery (all in present-day Armenia), and at the Church of St Gregory of the Illuminator or the Bagnayr Monastery in Ani. In many of these examples, muqarnas vaults are recurring features in the gavits (narthexes) of the churches, which were the locus of much innovation and experimentation in medieval Armenian architecture. These borrowings of Islamic architectural motifs may have been due to either Ilkhanid or Seljuk influences in the region, although the wide geographic spread of muqarnas usage in this period makes it difficult to pinpoint any specific influence with certainty.\nThe muqarnas motif was clearly inspired by Islamic sources, but it was used differently, and the Armenian muqarnas vault with oculus was not found in the Muslim world until it was copied about a century later, as in the vault of the Yakutiye Madrasa in nearby Erzurum (1310).\n\n\n== Il-Khanate imperial decrees ==\n\nAni was under Armenian Zakarid and nominal Georgian control for a few decades after 1199, until the Mongol conquests of 1236. The Zakarids submitted to the Mongols and were allowed to retain their lands, but remained under Mongol suzerainty, especially after 1256 when the Il-khanate formally absorded Armenia. The Il-khante managed taxation, and there are several inscriptions at the Church of the Holy apostle, dealing with tax edicts in the name of the Il-khan.\nFrom around 1260, with the Mongol Il-Khanate control of the city and suzerainty over the local Zakarid dynasty, the gavit seems to have been use as some sort of legal office in charge of taxes and import duties. Several official annoucements, often yarlighs (imperial decrees), using the formulation \"[In the name of] the Ilkhan\", have been inscribed on the walls of the gavit. In these inscriptions the Armenian language is used, but the format and even the terminology are Mongol.\nAn inscription in the name of the Il-Khan  is dated 1269, and reports the cancellation of taxes:\n\n718 (ie 1269). (In the name) of the Il-khan.\nBy the grace of God, we, customs officers, for the longevity of our masters, Sahip-Divan, Sahmad and Qarimadin, have removed from Ani the tax for priests that this city did not pay not originally; we confirm (this exemption again). No one has the right to demand tax, whatever nationality or family he may be. The one who [said] otherwise or who bothers to [request] the tax, is cursed by the 318 Fathers; those who observe] (this) are blessed by God. I[srael the writer].\nAnother one in 1276:\n\nIn 725 (ie 1276). (In the name) of the Il-khan.For the longevity of the Padishah and the Saïp-Divan, we, customs officers of Ani: Hindutchakh, (who) is the son of the lord judge, Oussup from Za[ta], Gorg from Nouât, and the mercer Baulé, and the gdrik of the oven, we gave this writing to the controllers (?) of Ani, having noticed that they were encouraged by unfair customs officials, and we have removed (them). They perceived on each beast of burden half of its charge (?); we, the aforementioned customs officers, have abolished (this) for the longevity of the Padishah.\nAlso in the name of the Il-Khan, an inscription by Bishop Mkhithar, dated to circa 1276, under the authority of dom Sargis and Malik Phakhradin, prohibiting commerce on Sundays in the street, following an earthquake that year (located in one of the alcoves of the gavit).\n\nIn the name of the Il-khan. By the grace of God, under the government of this city, under the superiority of Dom Sarguis, and under the authority of the melik Phakhradin, I Bishop Mkhithar, originally from Teglier, because of the earthquake that took place these days, we have eliminated the Sunday trade in the street. [He who] opposes this writing, great or small, is responsible for\nsins of this city.\n\n\n== Other inscriptions ==\nOther important incriptions in the Church of the Holy Apostles include:\n\nA 1217 inscription by Archibishop dom Grigor, son of Apughamr, announcing the cancellation of taxes for Shirak Province and the churches of Ani.\nA 1253-1276 inscription by Agbugha\tI, son of Shahnshah I lamenting about high taxes in Ani (this is the inscription just above the gate of the gavit, above the muqarna decoration).\nA 1303 inscription by Agbugha II, son of Ivane II, lamenting about the high level of taxes, and announcing the cancellation of several of them.\nA 1320 inscription by Princess Kuandze, wife of Shahnshah II Zakarian (inside the gavit, on the inside of the arcade next to the gate of the church).\nA 1348 inscription by a certain Chapadin, son of Hovhannes, donating gift for the monks of the church (inside wall of the gavit).\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmenian medieval sculpture\nSeljuk architecture\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Ani, église des Saints-Apôtres (Many high quality photographs)\".

        "content": "Zuko Mdunyelwa (born 9 July 1999) is a South African soccer player who plays as a defender for Mamelodi Sundowns in the Premier Soccer League.\nMdunyelwa came through the academy YSD Macassar. He was included in an Ikapa United team that played international tournaments. He was promoted to the first team of Cape Town City in August 2020, during the postponed 2019-20 South African Premier Division campaign. At the time, he was an under-20 international. He helped win the 2018 COSAFA U-20 Cup, but for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup he was only included in the preliminary and not the final squad. He spent time on loan at Cape Umoya United in the National First Division. He then joined Chippa United and made his first-tier debut in the 2021-22 South African Premier Division.\nMdunyelwa was called up for South Africa for the 2022 COSAFA Cup, where he made his international debut against Mozambique. The match ended in a penalty shootout, where Mdunyelwa scored his penalty kick, but South Africa lost. During the consolation tournament, in the \"plate semi final\" against Madagascar, Mdunyelwa recorded an assist. Mdunyelwa also played the 2022 African Nations Championship qualification match against the Comoros.\nIn the winter of 2023, there were talks of a transfer to Stellenbosch and even the signing of a \"pre-contract\". He instead remained in Chippa United, until Mamelodi Sundowns signed him during the 2023–24 winter window. Rhulani Mokwena explained the need to have another right back in the squad alongside Khuliso Mudau, with a desire to play Thapelo Morena in another position.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The perreras (lit. 'dog kennels'), also known as chirrincheras, are the name given in Venezuela to trucks generally used to move livestock or heavy objects. Although historically people in rural and indigenous areas used to board them to move banana bags, during the crisis in Venezuela and in recent years their use has grown in cities such as Caracas, Maracaibo, Maracay, Valencia, Carúpano, Puerto La Cruz, Mérida, Puerto Ayacucho, among others, due to hyperinflation, the disabling of public transportation units such as buses, shortage of spare parts for vehicles and lack of cash, among other factors. The name comes from the similarity of the vehicles with the vans used to pick up dogs from the street. They lack safety for the transportation of people, as they do not have seats or seat belts. As they are not suitable vehicles for transporting people, the use of perreras can cause serious injuries and death of users. In 2018 alone, at least 32 passengers died from falls or rollovers.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPerreras consist of private vehicles such as dump trucks, pickup trucks, debris trucks generally used to move livestock or heavy objects such as industrial parts, food or garbage that are not suitable for transporting people. They were originally nicknamed this way decades ago in rural and indigenous areas, where they were common transport in the countryside and people would board them to move banana bags. However, during the presidency of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela began to experience a public transportation crisis never seen before in modern times, affected by the rising cost and shortage of spare parts, as well as the lack of public investment, which forced users to make long walks and to take the perreras to the cities to cover the lack of vehicles.\nAccording to Gustavo Chourio, an urban planning expert at the University of Zulia, about 30 percent of Venezuelans used to own their own vehicle, the highest average in Latin America, a proportion that has dropped drastically by 2018 because few people had sufficient resources to buy spare parts such as tires or batteries. Repairing buses and other public transport vehicles had become increasingly difficult due to the scarcity of spare parts. By 2018, according to the Committee of Public Transport Users in Caracas, 95% of cars, buses and cabs were disabled, while the number of perreras, operated by anyone with the means to drive a vehicle, had increased by 25%. Luis Alberto Salazar, president of the committee and its main spokesman, has stated that there are at least 150,000 perreras in Venezuela. Oscar Gutiérrez, driver and union leader in the state of Miranda, has stated that by the same year only 10% of the 12,000 buses that existed in the state were left, and according to the Intergremial Transportation Command, at least 90% of the 300,000 units covering the various routes in the country were in technical shutdown due to the lack of spare parts.\n\n\n== History ==\nFar from banning them because of their unsafe conditions, the Venezuelan government has presented the vehicles as an innovation in transportation and has justified their emergence, several pro-government governors and mayors have activated their own free fleet of perreras. Nicolás Maduro tried to solve the problem in 2015 with the purchase of 15,000 Yutong buses built in China. Most of said units, however, ended up broken down in official garages because there were no spare parts. In 2018, in Maracaibo, the Armed Forces decided to place military trucks along the main routes to help passengers move freely, but the initiative did not last long after a series of complaints that the trucks were too tall for passengers to board.\nIn April, during Expo Potencia 2018, an event in Caracas promoted by Nicolás Maduro to show the \"production capacity\" of companies linked to the government, the National Road Maintenance Company, attached to the Ministry of Transportation and which sells supplies for such as tires and oils, exhibited a model of a perrera built from a cargo truck that had no seats but walls made of brass and metal bars that supported the roof of the truck and from which users had to hold on. Erika Farías, mayor of the Libertador municipality, where the historic center of Caracas is concentrated, said that \"these contingency trucks were placed at the disposal of our people so that during rush hours they can help to lighten the waiting time\".\n\n\n== Risks ==\nAs they are not suitable vehicles for the transportation of people, the use of perreras can cause serious injuries and death of the users. According to Luis Alberto Salazar, president of the Committee of Public Transportation Users, for the first half of 2018 there were 25 deaths of passengers due to the use of perreras: sixteen in Mérida, two in Valencia, four in Tocuyito (Carabobo), two in Güiria (Sucre) and one in Puerto Ayacucho. Besides the deaths, there are no means to take care of the injured and there is no one to take responsibility for the lives of the people. The transportation committee later updated the figure to at least 32 deaths and more than 100 seriously injured. A parliamentary commission of the National Assembly denounced that in the second quarter of the year, between April and July 2018, there were 55 deaths and 275 injuries due to the use of improvised means of transportation, such as perreras. Likewise, the Road Safety Observatory in its\" VI Report on the Road Safety Situation in Venezuela\" analyzes traffic accidents related to the transport of people in perreras and the laws that are being violated.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransport in Venezuela\nCrisis in Venezuela\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Before the language of Ancient Egypt was first decoded in the early nineteenth century, a period of Egypt's history was known as the Imaginary History of Egypt (Arabic: تاريخ مصر الخرافى). These histories were widespread throughout the Arab and Coptic realms of Egypt itself, and were based on biblical writings, mythical tales, and bad copywriting from the works of Greek historians like Manetho.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The beginning of the period of mythical history of Egypt ===\nAfter Christianity had entered Egypt under the Eastern Roman Empire, the history of Egypt gradually disappeared from memory, and people were unable to read the letters of the ancient Egyptian language, such as hieroglyphics. After Islam entered Egypt after the Arab conquest of Egypt, the ancient Egyptian culture and monuments were further ignored and neglected. The Coptics were generally not interested in anything beyond the history of Christianity in their land, and they destroyed or covered up many ancient temples of the Egyptian religion. The Muslims, on the other hand, were generally quite ignorant of the Greek and Roman historians. They quoted from the other Arabs who, although they were interested in other Greek works like Manetho, did not look thoroughly into history, resulting in the books of Muslim historians including several fictitious accounts and stories.\n\n\n=== The end of the mythological Egypt ===\n\nAfter Jean-François Champollion and other scholars like Thomas Young were able to decipher the hieroglyphics and similar scripts like the hieratic scripts in the early nineteenth century, the true history of Egypt became widespread. Before this, it was widely believed that the Egyptian language was exclusively ideographic. They had succeeded in areas the previous historians had failed to succeed in, such as understanding the language of the ancient Egyptians.\n\n\n== The mythical rulers of Egypt ==\nThe mythical history of Egypt was divided into four periods, one before the Great Flood and one after it, another for the Amalekite rule, and the last one for the history of Egypt before the Arab conquest.\n\n\n=== Before the Flood ===\nMizraim, whose real name is Mizraim ibn Maraqil ibn Da'wil ibn Arabak ibn Adam, is said to be the first king of this period. He is then said to have been succeeded by son, Naqraush. Mizraim is credited with building towers and pillars in Egypt, before dying after a hundred and eighty years and being mummified.\nKhasalim, a king who first placed idols in Egypt to predict the intensity of the annual floods.\nSurid ibn Salhouk, who is later identified as being the same as the historically real ruler, Khufu. Surid is credited with building the Great Pyramid of Giza after he had a nightmare, later interpreted to be the coming of the Great Flood. So, he built the pyramids to store and preseve the information and knowledge of the world, as well as serve as his tomb. The Great Flood would not happen until 300 years later.\n\n\n=== After the Flood ===\nMisraim, the son or grandson of Ham (who himself is the son of Noah) is said to be the first king ruling Egypt after the flood. He is credited with the construction of the historical city of Memphis. He dies after a reign of seven hundred years, succeeding him are his sons Qaft, Ashmoun, Atrib, and Sa.\nQiftarim succeeds the Misraim dynasty, and is credited as the one who built the pyramids of Dahshur and the city of Dendera. During his reign, polytheism and idol worship returned to Egypt. His reign ended after four hundred years, and he was buried in a heavily-guarded tomb somewhere near the Arabian Peninsula. Qiftarim's grave was protected by two large copper idols which would scare off grave robbers.\nMaliq al-Budshir ruled after Qiftarim. He was a distinguished scholar who specialized in talismans, magic, and the occult. He was able to perform miracles, including the creation of a miraculous tree. During his reign, thanks to this special tree, his people were satisfied with eating meat.\nHermes Trismegistus also lived during the reign of Maliq al-Budshir, and he was hired to discover the sources of the Nile and make some talismans there. Suddenly, Maliq al-Budshir disappeared after ascending to live in the clouds, and his voice summoned his soldiers to appoint his son Adeem as the new ruler of Egypt.\n\nMenaquish is another ruler, credited with dividing Egypt's tax into four parts; a quarter for his personal use, a quarter for the army, a quarter for infrastructural developments, and a quarter for medical needs. Egypt's revenue would exceed more than a million during his reign. After him, his son Mettaish ruled, who is credited with the invention of the Golden calf in Biblical and Islamic literature.\nAshmoun is regarded as the longest reigning king of the legendary history of Egypt, with a reign of at least eight hundred years. During his reign, the tribe of Ad had invaded part of Egypt, but he was succesfully able to repel them after ninety years. Ashmoun's son, Menaquish, ruled after him and was the one who first tamed beasts for personal use in Egypt.\nMerqurah, said to have been a wise magician, was the next ruler after Menaquish. But Merqurah died early, leaving behind his young son Bilates as the Pharaoh. Due to his incapability to rule due to his age, his mother became his regent. She is said to have been a capable and just ruler, who gained the affection of her subjects by lowering the taxation fees. When Bilates reached manhood, he ditched his royal responsibilities and left all the rulership in her hands, and amused himself with hunting. After a reign of thirteen years he died of small-pox and the succession passed to his uncle Atrib.\nTutis, probably Teti or Sanakht is the biblical Pharaoh who met with Abram and Sarai. After his repentance, Tutis gave the slave Hagar to Abram as a gift. Tutis' daughter Guriaq ruled Egypt after him, and during her reign the Amalekites invaded Egypt under the leadership of Salitis, known in the Arabian folklore as Al-Walid ibn Duma.\n\n\n=== Amalekite period ===\nThe rule of the Hyksos in Egypt is known as the rule of the Amalekites in the legends.\n\nAl-Walid ibn Duma is the first of the Amalekite rulers. Identified with Salitis.\nRayyan ibn al-Walid ibn Duma is the second of these mythical Amalekite rulers. He (or his son 'Ubayd) is believed to be the biblical Pharaoh which met with Joseph during his stay in Egypt. He is identified with Khyan.\nDarim is the third of these mythical rulers. He is said to be a miracle worker, and is credited with the invention of an ancient microwave oven and the predecessor to the modern farmhouse. Identified with either Yanassi or Apepi.\nMo'dan is the fourth of the mythical rulers, and is said to have drowned in the Nile. Identified with either Yanassi or Apepi.\nKasim ibn Mo'dan, known as Aksames, is the fifth of these mythical Amalekite rulers, and according to the legends, his death occured when he drowned in the Nile. He is identified as the last Hyksos ruler, Khamudi. Some have identified him with the Pharaoh of Moses.\nAl-Walid ibn Musab is the last of these mythical rulers. Muslim historians affirm him to be the Pharaoh of Moses, hence he is said to be the Pharaoh in the Qu'ran. His origins are disputed whether he is an Amalekite, Canaanite or a native Egyptian. He is also credited with the mass employment of sorcerers in his territory. In some sources, he succeeds a relatively unknown Qabus ibn Musab.\n\n\n=== The remainder period after the Passover ===\nAfter the Israelites had departed from Egypt, Egypt became a barren land. It was then ruled by a woman named Daluka for a hundred and thirty years. After Daluka's demise, a man named Darkun was appointed as the ruler of Egypt. But his reign was interrupted when Nebuchadnezzar II, known in the legends as Marnoush, sacked and raided Egypt. Then, Egypt became deserted and desolate for many years until the arrival of the Achaemenid Empire, who were defeated by Alexander the Great. After the Greeks had left Egypt, it was ruled by the Copts until the reign of Muqawqis, during whose rule the Arabs conquered Egypt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEgypt in the Western imagination\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo (born 28 May 1995) is a South African soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Orlando Pirates in the Premier Soccer League.\nNdlondlo played for Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and then for Marumo Gallants, the team which bought TTM's license. He made his first-tier debut in the 2020-21 South African Premier Division.\nNdlondlo was on the winning team in the 2020-21 (where he scored the winning goal) and 2022-23 Nedbank Cup, and was on the losing team in the 2021-22 Nedbank Cup final. He did so alongside teammate Miguel Timm, with the duo first playing for TTM, then for Marumo Gallants and the third time for Orlando Pirates. With three consecutive cup finals for three different clubs, Ndlondo and Timm equalled a record held by Kermit Erasmus, who achieved the same feat in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\nAfter the 2021-22 season concluded, there were several rumours about a transfer for Ndlondlo to one of South Africa's biggest clubs or to AmaZulu. While Ndlondo started the 2022-23 season at Marumo Gallants as well, he was bought by Orlando Pirates on the last day of the transfer window. He scored his first goal for Orlando Pirates in January 2023. In his first season with the Bucs, the team won the cup and finished second in the league.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Church Street is a historic street in the market town of Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, England. It runs for about 210 feet (70 yards), from Ball Street in the north to Market Place in the south. An entrance to Poulton's Teanlowe Centre shopping precinct is located where Church Street merges into Market Place. The street was pedestrianised in 1983.\nThe eastern side of the street forms the western boundary of the raised graveyard of St Chad's Church, for which Church Street is named. In the early 20th century, the row of buildings lining the southern side of Ball Street, and those on the eastern side of Church Street, were demolished, resulting in today's unobsctructed view of St Chad's. Now, between the northern end of the pedestrianised Church Street to the west and the Thatched House (built in 1907) in the east, there are two bus stops along the paved area.\nThe Old Town Hall public house, built in 1910, stands on Church Street. The Bay Horse Inn stood on the site from 1869.\nIn 1926, Church Street was listed in The London Gazette as one of the streets of Poulton under which a mains electricity supply was to be installed within a two-year period.\nChurch Street is part of Wyre Council's Poulton-le-Fylde Conservation Area Appraisal.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

Born from the ashes of Ruffier Racing in 2015, the team began racing GT3 cars in the 24H Series before moving on to sports prototypes. Spearheaded by LMP2 ace Paul-Loup Chatin for much of its history, IDEC won the 2019 European Le Mans Series title and has twice set class pole position at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 2018 and 2023. Although IDEC's corporate colour is red, it has most recently borne the colours of classic French brands Delage and Matra. It is currently active in both the ELMS in LMP2 and the Michelin Le Mans Cup in LMP3.\nThe team is led by Patrice Lafargue, founder and CEO of the IDEC Group, a real estate construction company also known for its sponsorship of sailing trimarans. Former Peugeot factory driver Nicolas Minassian joined him in 2018 as sporting director.\n\n\n== Racing record ==\n\n\n=== European Le Mans Series ===\n\n\n=== 24 Hours of Le Mans results ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Kurt-Arne Langeland (born 25 August 1969) is a Norwegian politician for the Christian Democratic Party.\nHe served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from Hordaland during the terms 1993–1997 and 1997–2001. In total he met during 197 days of parliamentary session. Ahead of the 1997 election he was put forward by the nomination committee of Hordaland Christian Democratic Party as the third candidate on the election ballot, which was regarded as a good chance for a seat in Parliament. However, but at the nomination meeting he was edged out by Ingebrigt Sørfonn. As the Christian Democratic Party performed well in 1997 and achieved its highest vote tally ever, Langeland became first deputy throughout the term.\nLangeland hails from Fjell and was also a member of Hordaland county council.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Guaire River Miners, also known as Guaire River Garimpeiros, is the name given to the people who search for metals in the Guaire River, a 72-kilometer-long river in Caracas, Venezuela that is highly contaminated with sewage. The miners are mainly minors, homeless people or blue-collar workers who lost their jobs due to the shutdown of government works or whose salaries are not enough to subsist and do not want to resort to crime. Despite being a practice that dates back to at least 1994, as of 2016 the number of people engaged in this trade increased to dozens and even hundreds during the Venezuelan economic crisis, characterized by hyperinflation and shortages.\n\n\n== History ==\nSearching for metals in the Guaire River is a practice that has existed for decades in Caracas. In 1994, journalist Anna Vaccarella in the program \"Alerta\" broadcast by Radio Caracas Televisión showed how some Venezuelans living on the streets were engaged in this activity. However, during the crisis in Venezuela, the devaluation of wages and the shutdown of government construction work has forced more people to resort to mining, including people who are not homeless. Since 2016, dozens of people began to search for metals daily in the sewers, and at the busiest point of the waterway, in the Caño Amarillo sector, the presence of up to three hundred people has been reported.\nThe Guaire river crosses a large part of Caracas, where waste and garbage continuously flow. In 2005, during the government of President Hugo Chávez, a plan for its sanitation was organized in front of several regional leaders, and on 18 August he promised that \"Next year I invite you all and you, Daniel Ortega, I invite you to bathe in the Guaire next year\". Jacqueline Faría, then Minister of the Environment, was in charge of the project. In 2006, 772 billion bolivars were allocated for the work, and in 2007 Jacqueline Faría assured that although the cleaning of a river like the Guaire could take up to 15 years, the \"revolutionary process\" would deliver a clean river in 2014. As of July 2016, the Inter-American Development Bank invested US$83.6 million to clean up the Guaire River, and in the same year, the Parliamentary Commission of Administration and Services of the National Assembly, chaired by deputy Stalin González, along with the Commission of Environment and Natural Resources, denounced that US$ 77 million had been spent for the cleanup of the river, when the execution of the project was only 26%.\nOn 19 April 2017, during the Mother of All Marches in the 2017 Venezuelan protests, several opposition demonstrators had to cross the Guaire River to escape the tear gas used by security forces; a Twitter user asked Faría about the destination of the dollars directed to the sanitation project, to which she replied \"They were fully invested, ask your people who took a good bath!\". Her answer generated a large number of replies condemning the statement. According to Juan Bautista González, a professor at the Universidad Central de Venezuela who coordinated the social component of the Guaire River Sanitation Project from Catia to Quinta Crespo, US$ 14 billion had been invested in the recovery of the Guaire River, which were \"stolen\" according to him. As of 2018, the destination of the project's investment was unknown.\n\n\n== Location and work ==\nAlthough Caño Amarillo is one of the places most frequented by miners, their presence has also been reported in other places along the river, such as in the Lídice and Manicomio creeks, in Antímano (near the walkway of the Andrés Bello Catholic University), in Quinta Crespo, in Plaza Venezuela, behind the University Stadium and in the Central University of Venezuela, in Las Mercedes and Bello Monte, in La California Sur and El Llanito, in San Martín (after the Ayacucho Bridge), in El Paraíso, in Carapita and in Los Teques city.\nThe miners spend minutes and even hours searching and digging in the water for items such as rings, chains, brooches, charms and jewelry made of precious metals such as gold, silver or copper. They generally do not wear any protection, gloves or boots, and some even work without shirts or shoes, wearing only shorts, despite the diseases that can be contracted in the drainage. Between 2017 and 2018 the miners reported that daily they could earn between 100 000 up to 500 000 bolivars in pieces, or up to 19 million bolivars a week, much more than the minimum wage in Venezuela or the salary of employees such as laborers, bricklayers or painters. Metals are sold at the Mercado de los Corotos in Quinta Crespo or at Capitolio, where by March 2018 informal sellers were buying a gram of 18-karat gold for between 10 million and up to 15 million bolivars, and for a little less if the purchase is made in cash.\n\n\n== Risks ==\nAccording to José Félix Oletta, former Minister of Health, diseases such as cholera (a very severe infectious disease), leptospirosis and all water-borne diseases can be contracted in the Guaire river. He has said that all the negative agents of the digestive system are present in the Guaire, including salmonella and escherichia coli, as well as viruses of oral fecal transmission such as hepatitis A and protozoan parasites, warning that natural immunity is not acquired, that some of the diseases can develop several times and that infected persons can be carriers of the disease and affect others. According to infectologist Julio Castro, the bacteria in the river are rapidly contagious and can spread diseases, such as leptospirosis, viral hepatitis or tetanus.\nMiners have reported stigmatization because of their trade, and have been mocked or prejudged as criminals. Some miners have also died when they were carried away by the current of the river.\nSeveral police officers, according to the miners, including the security forces of the presidential Miraflores Palace, have searched, beaten and extorted the miners, stealing the pieces obtained in the Guaire, sometimes waiting for them in Capitolio when they go to sell the metals. Groups of miners are usually detained by the National Guard or the Bolivarian National Police.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEconomy of Venezuela\nCrisis in Venezuela\nMining in Venezuela\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cryphalus abietis is a small bark beetle (subfamily Scolytinae, family Curculionidae), around 1.6 mm long, that is widely distributed in Europe. It infests mainly spruce trees (Picea), but also other conifers.  Like closely related species, e.g. Cryphalus saltuarius, C. abietis attacks primarily weakened and freshly dead branches of its host trees, and usually does not kill trees.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nWhile C. abietis is well known in the German literature, its taxonomy has been often confused elsewhere due to its similarity with Cryphalus saltuarius, the destruction of its type specimens during World War II, and a statement by Wood in 1972 that it is a synonym of  Cryphalus asperatus. For example, Justesen et al. provided detailed descriptions of C. abietis and its biology under the name \"Cryphalus asperatus (Gyllenhal, 1813), syn. Bostrichus abietis Ratzeburg, 1837\". However, the authors clarified in a subsequent publication that Cryphalus abietis is a separate species and that Cryphalus asperatus and Cryphalus saltuarius are synonyms. Therefore, in some publications, the name Cryphalus asperatus needs to be replaced by Cryphalus abietis. For more details see the taxonomy section of Cryphalus saltuarius.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nC. abietis has been reported from nearly all European countries, but is absent from the most northern region of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. In addition, records from northern Africa, western Asia and far eastern Asia are uncertain, due to the presence of very similar species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe adult beetle of C. abietis is between 1.4 and 1.9 mm long, average 1.6 mm, and 2.3× longer than wide. The color is dark brown to black, but the base of the antennae and parts of the legs are lighter brown. The pronotum is domed, covered with tiny humps (also called 'asperities') on its anterior slope bordering the head. The elytra have longitudinal stripes or grooves with rows of punctures.\nMorphologically, C. abietis is very similar to Cryphalus saltuarius, both species may overlap in some features and can be confused. However, C. abietis is on average smaller and the longitudinal grooves on the elytra are usually clearer, deeper and wider. Both species can be reliably separated by the size and shape of the male aedeagus and by their DNA structure. \n\n\n== Biology ==\nSpruce species are the main host plants, in particular, Norway spruce (Picea abies), other Picea species like P. obovata or P. orientalis and some fir species like Abies procera are also important hots. Pine species and some other conifers can be also infested. Preferably, branches with a thin bark are attacked. Freshly dead branches are also infested. Often the attack starts at the axil of a shoot. However, the damage caused by C. abietis seems to be rarely significant. Some reports of young trees being destroyed or weakened by the beetle could have been associated with seedlings being damaged during transport.\nC. abietis may overwinter as adult beetle, larva or pupa. According to Ratzeburg it is the earliest bark beetle in Germany and emerges already when there is still snow. Males and females aggregate on suitable branches and after mating construct a large nuptial chamber under the bark, where the female deposits around 20 eggs. The developing larvae construct closely spaced galleries that radiate from this chamber and are 2–4 cm long. There is typically one generation per year in cooler parts of Europe, but 2 in southern parts (spring to early summer and summer to autumn).\n\n\n== References ==",

On 31 May 1600, he boarded a vessel for Europe at Banten, Java, purely out of curiosity, and arrived in Middelburg later that year, and would remain there for several months. According to historians, his level of calligraphy shows that he did not belong to the uppermost classes of society.\n\nHe is portrayed on Rubens ca. 1617 painting Miracles of St. Francis Xavier and on a chalk drawing of the same year. The hat worn by Yppong on the portrayals designates literacy. Rubens and Yppong never actually met, as Rubens was in Venice at the time of Yppong's visit. Up to 2016, the man pictured was thought to be Korean, possibly António Corea.\n\n\n== References ==",

Voto Joven assisted the 2017 Venezuelan consultation process, along with organizations such as Súmate and EsData.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nVoto Joven was featured in the 2012 documentary film A Whisper to a Roar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSúmate\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

This was in part due to the number of financially weak councils with small populations in rural areas, dating from an earlier time when industry and population had justified their creation. The Commission reported back on 27 July 2007, recommending massive amalgamations all over the State into \"regional councils\" centred on major towns or centres, based on a range of criteria such as economy of scale, community of interest and financial sustainability.\nOn 10 August 2007, the commission's amalgamation recommendations passed into law as the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007, with only a few name changes as alterations. \"Local Transition Committees\" (LTCs) were created for each new area, made up of councillors and staff from the original areas, with the old entities formally ceasing to exist on the day of the 2008 local elections.\n\n\n=== 2012 de-amalgamation push ===\nDuring the 2012 Queensland state election campaign, the Liberal National Party promised to reconsider the amalgamations. Having won government on 24 March 2012, they invited former shires wishing to de-amalgamate to make submissions which:\n\ndemonstrated that it was financially viable to de-amalgamate\naccepted that the re-established shire would bear the full costs of de-amalgamation\nwas supported by the signatures of at least 20% of the voters in the former shires.\nViable proposals would then be put to a referendum in the former shire for a majority vote on de-amalgamation. Submissions were received from 19 communities, but only four submissions were found to be viable: Douglas, Livingstone, Mareeba and Noosa.\n\n\n=== March 2013 de-amalgamation polls ===\nOn 9 March 2013, polls were held in the four affected former shires, asking residents if they wanted to de-amalgamate. Voting was compulsory.\nThe wording of the question for each region was: \"Should a [former LGA] Shire Council be created by the de-amalgamation of the [current LGA] Regional Council local government area, with the costs to be met by the [former LGA] Shire Council?\"\nThe \"Yes\" vote won in all councils, with the highest vote in Noosa, where more than 80% of residents voted to split from Sunshine Coast.\n\n\n== References ==",

She also wrote articles for Die Lehrerin: Organ des Allgemeinen Deutschen Lehrerinnenvereins (The teacher: Organ of the General German Teachers' Association).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilhelmine Lohmann was born at Hamm, North Rhine-Westphalia, September 23, 1872.\nShe was educated at a girls’ higher school in Hamm and at a teachers’ seminary.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1891 to 1910, she was engaged in the teaching profession in Brussels, Belgium, at Essen-on-the-Ruhr, and at Bielefeld, Westphalia.\nSince 1910, she occupied herself with social service and temperance work in Bielefeld.\nLohmann became actively identified with the struggle against alcoholism in Germany in 1904, when, upon the organization of the Society of Abstaining Women Teachers (Verein Abstinenter Lehrerinnen) she became a member of that society, of which she served for fourteen years (1910–24) as president. In 1905, she affiliated herself with the German League of Abstaining Women (Deutseher Bawd Abstinenter Frauen), and later acted as second president of that organization. Since 1919, she was one of the leaders of the German Central Organization for Temperance Instruction (Deutsche Cent rale filr Nilchternheitsunterricht), and since 1921, a member of the Committee for the Prohibition of Alcohol (Ausschuss filr Alkohol-verbot) and director of the Bielefeld branch office. In 1924, she became second president of the German League of Abstaining Educators (Deutseher liu/nd enthaltsamer Erzieher) and business manager of the International Teachers’ League against Alcoholism (Internationale Lehrerbund gegen den Alkoholismus).\nAt the International Convention of the World League Against Alcoholism, held at Toronto, Canada, in November 1922, Lohmann testified of her work among German teachers in furthering scientific temperance instruction in that country. In connection with the work of the German Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which organization she represented at the convention, she stated that the campaign for temperance instruction in the schools of Germany was inaugurated during the opening years of the twentieth century and that, in spite of opposition on the part of the German Government, the work had been steadily progressing. Lohmann was also a delegate to the Sixteenth International Congress Against Alcoholism, held at Lausanne, Switzerland, in August 1921.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"Die Abstinenz als patriotische Liebestat\", Die Lehrerin, 31(1914), 34, pgs, 260–261\n\"Die 7.

        "content": "The former Derveni railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομικός Σταθμός Δερβένι, Sidirodromikos Stathmos Derveni) was on the former metre gauge Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways (Piraeus–Patras railway).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways reached Derveni in July 1884. The main building, designed by architect Anthony Dragoymi (Greek: Αντώνη Δραγούμη) was inaugurated in 1885. Derveni station, like many similar station buildings, has the typical architectural and structural features of stone buildings with wooden ceilings and a brick roof. You will notice the jamb on all four corners, the framing of doors and windows (usually red bricks), the false ceiling with roof slats and goat hair for lime plaster, the big trusses, the arched windows, the big wooden panelled doors and the decorative fascias. 30 September 1968 34 people were killed and 125 injured at the station when a fast exsress train collided with a stationary stopping train in the worst railway tragedy in Greece (at the time). The station closed to regular traffic on 9 July 2007, having been originally planned to be replaced with a station on the new Athens Airport–Patras line, but this was never carried out. The old station continued to be used by tourist excursion trains, There is an intention of the Peloponnese region for a means of fixed orbit from Corinth to Derveni. From 22 June 2020, the area of Derveni to Aegio and Athens will be covered by Lygia Corinthia railway station.\nThe station building remains the property of GAIAOSE and is included in the list of old railway stations designated as “art work” protected by the state.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sashik Sultanyan (Armenian: Սաշիկ Սուլթանյանի) is an Armenian human rights activist. A member of Armenia's Yazidi minority, Sultanyan founded the Yezidi Centre for Human Rights, which advocated for the preservation of Yazidi culture and language, as well as the integration of Yazidis and other ethnic minorities into Armenian society.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nSultanyan was born into a Yazidi family in Armenia, where Yazidis constitute the largest ethnic minority in the country. He first began publicly advocating for the rights of Yazidis in 2013, first as a youth activist and subsequently as a minority fellow at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In 2018, Sultanyan founded the nongovernmental organisation, the Yezidi Centre for Human Rights, which focused on community mobilisation and education and integration activism for ethnic minorities living in Armenia.\n\n\n=== Criminal investigation and subsequent trial ===\n\n\n==== Investigation ====\nIn June 2020, the Iraq-based Yazidi News website published an interview with Sultanyan in which he spoke about the difficulties facing Yazidis living in Armenia. He stated that Yazidis faced discrimination by Armenian authorities; that they were unable to properly study their language and culture; and that they were underrepresented in local government. Sultanyan also accused oligarchs of seizing Yazidi properties and described how Yazidis were living in fear and poverty as a result.\nOn 3 October 2020, the National Security Service launched a criminal investigation into Sultanyan following a complaint made by Narek Malyan, the leader of the far-right Veto Movement. Malyan accused Sultanyan of being affiliated with George Soros after receiving a grant from Soros' Open Society Foundations, and that Sultanyan sought to \"sow ethnic conflict\" in an attempt to overthrow the Armenian government.\nWhile Sultanyan was aware of an NSS investigation, he was not told the reasoning behind the investigation until 20 May 2021, when the NSS searched his home, as well as the offices of the Yezidi Centre for Human Rights in Yerevan, confiscating three computers. This led to the temporary halting of the centre's work due to the loss of its technical equipment. Sultanyan stated that his interview with Yazidi News had been a private conversation that had been published without his consent.\nOn 29 July 2021, the NSS submitted their investigation to the Prosecutor General's Office, issuing an indictment against Sultanyan for inciting national enmity among Yazidis, in breach of article 226 of Armenia's criminal code.\n\n\n==== Trial ====\nSultanyan's trial commenced in November 2021 at the Yerevan General Jurisdiction Court. Prosecutors stated that Yazidis did not experience discrimination in Armenia, and accused Sultanyan of attempting to \"hoodwink\" Yazidis. They cited evidence including previous comments made by Sultanyan in which he described some Yazidis as living \"prosperously\", as well as several Yazidi witnesses who disputed Sultanyan's claims.\nSultanyan's defence was led by lawyers from the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly–Vanadzor, a local human rights organisation; he pled not guilty to the charges. They stated that the NSS began wiretapping Sultanyan in April 2020, five months prior to the start of their official investigation, and that there was no evidence of criminality by Sultanyan during that time. They also criticised the NSS' focus on Malyan's \"suspicious\" criminal complaint, citing both Malyan's previous targeting of human rights activists on dubious charges, in addition to describing Malyan's translation of the Yazidi News article (which had originally been published in Arabic) as being inaccurate and not professionally translated into Armenian. Sultanyan stated that his criticisms had been aimed at Armenian authorities, and not Armenian people.\n\n\n==== Response ====\nHuman Rights Watch accused Armenian authorities of attempting to interfere with Sultanyan's human rights activism, by falsely equating his freedom of speech with criminal incitement, and called for the charges against Sultanyan to be dropped. Both the Council of Europe and the United Nations released public statements calling for the charges to be reversed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 1947 is a peculiar lenticular galaxy in the constellation Dorado. The galaxy lies about 50 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 1947 is approximately 75,000 light years across. It was discovered by James Dunlop on November 5, 1826.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe galaxy is characterised by the presence of dust lanes across the minor axis of the galaxy, indicating it is a polar-ring galaxy. The galaxy has one central dust lane while three more less pronounced lanes are visible which look like concentric rings. Although it is categorised as a lenticular galaxy, it lacks a disk, having thus more in common with elliptical galaxies.Molecular gas has been detected around the nucleus of the galaxy with an estimated hydrogren mass of 4.2×108 M☉. The gas rotates in an axis perpendicular to that of the stars of the galaxy, but in its inner region it is warped. The kinematics suggest that the dust and gas have an external origin, probably accreted from a gas-rich galaxy, as there is a lack of tidal tails that would indicate it ts as a result of an unequal mass merger with a disk galaxy.The nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active and it is categorised as a LINER. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 1947 is the brightest galaxy in the NGC 1947 group, which also includes the galaxies ESO 085–065, ESO 085–088, and ESO 086–010. This group lies close to the Dorado Group.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 1947 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Antennarius scaber, the splitlure frogfish or strated frogfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Antennariidae, the frogfishes. This species is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean and was previously considered to be a synonym of Antennarius striatus.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAntennarius scaber was first formally described in 1817 as Chironectes scaber by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier with its type locality given as the Martinique. A. scaber was regarded as a synonym of A. striatus of the eastern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans but molecular and morphological evidence has confirmed that A scaber is a valid species. Within the genus Antennarius this species belongs to the striatus species group. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies the genus Antennarius in the family Antennariidae within the suborder Antennarioidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAntennarius scaber has the genus name Antennarius which suffixes -ius to antenna, an allusion to first dorsal spine being adapted into a tentacle on the snout used as a lure to attract prey. The specific name scaber, means \"rough\", an allusion to the rough skin with its covering of spinules.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAntennarius scaber has a globose rather compressed body with eyes on the sides of head. It has a very large, upwardly pointung mouth with numerous small teeth. The small round gill opening is located below and behind the base of the pectoral fin. There are three dorsal spines, the first is the Illicium which is tipped with an esca or \"lure\" made up of two vermiform appendages. The second dorsal spine is roughly straight and is connected to head by a smooth membrane. The third dorsal spine is movable and is not fixed to the skin. The limb-like pectoral fins have a  joint that resembles an elbow and is broadly connected to body. There are 7 soft rays in the anal fin and the dorsal fin has 12 soft rays. There is a caudal peduncle and the dorsal and anal fins are not joined to the caudal fin fin. The rough skin of the body has a dense covering of bifurcated spinules. The overall colour varies through yellow, orange, green, brown, grey, or almost white. There are irregular, slender brown bars and spots on the head, body and fins with dark discontinuous lines radiating out from the eye.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nAntennarius scaber is found in the western Atlantic Ocean where it occurs as far north as New Jersey and Bermuda south through the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the island groups of the Caribbean to the southernmost coast of Brazil. This species is found at depths between the surface and 219 m (719 ft) but is typically found at depths shallower than 30 m (98 ft) on reefs and sandy and muddy substrates.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nAnetnnarius scaber, like other frogfishes, is an ambush predator using the illicium with its escaa on teh tip to lure prey within striking distance of the mouth. Fishes in the genus Antennarius lay their eggs in gelatinous masses called rafts or veils. The eggs remain within this mass until they hatch.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Long May You Run\" is a song written and performed by Canadian rock artist Neil Young. It was released for the first time on the eponymous 1976 album credited to the Stills-Young Band, a collaboration between Young and Stephen Stills, and was released as a single but failed to chart. The song saw a single release again in 1993 as a live version from the album Neil Young Unplugged, and was fairly successful, reaching #28 in Canada and #34 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock. It also reached #71 in the UK.\n\n\n== History and meaning ==\nYoung's Pontiac hearse \"Mort\" (a.k.a. \"Mortimer Hearseburg\") was the inspiration for the song. In 1976, Stills and Young formed the Stills-Young Band and released the album Long May You Run. During the short-lived collaboration, the two wrote separately for the album, with Stills adding four songs and Young adding five, including the title track. Young also chose the song for his 1976 compilation Decade, and performed this song at the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, to an ovation of Canadian audience members.\n\n\n== Charts ==\nBillboard Mainstream Rock - 34\nCanada - 28\nUK - 71\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maria Amélia de Sousa Ferreira Chaves de Almeida Fernandes (28 January 1911 – 4 May 2017) was a Portuguese civil engineer. She was the first female civil engineer to graduate from the Instituto Superior Técnico of the Universidade Técnica de Lisboa. She is considered to be the first Portuguese woman to graduate and then work in civil engineering, and the first Portuguese female engineer to work in the field.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMaria Amélia de Sousa Ferreira Chaves was born in São Jorge de Arroios, Lisbon on 28 January 1911, the daughter of General João Carlos Pires Ferreira Chaves, a military commander and engineer. She had a brother Fernando de Sousa Ferreira Chaves. She was the niece of the engineer Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves, Maria Alexandrina Pires Ferreira Chaves and early Portuguese military pilot Olímpio Ferreira Chaves. She spent two years in India between 1927 and 1927 when her father was Chief of Staff of the Portuguese Army there. On her return she taught in a school to save money for her college education.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAt the age of 20, Maria Amélia Chaves entered the Instituto Superior Técnico of the Universidade Técnica de Lisboa in 1931. She studied on the general technical course, the first two years were on general technical subjects, with students choosing a specialism in the third year. She was expected to choose chemistry, as it was considered more suitable for a woman, but opted for the civil engineering course, which challenged social norms of the time. Chaves graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1937.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter a traineeship with the company run by engineer and later politician Eduardo Arantes e Oliveira, Chaves joined the staff of Lisbon City Council. It was unusual for a woman to work in civil engineering at the time, even more so to work outside the office and go into the field to supervise works on site. Chaves designed and had made a special trouser-skirt, so she could climb scaffolding without issue. She developed good working relationships with and become respected by the workers on site. However, she felt constantly restricted by her superiors, and resigned from the council in the 1940s.Chaves set up as an independent contractor and never stopped working in the construction industry. She was an innovator and undertook the first anti-seismic building tests carried out in Portugal, which she presented in two papers at the First Symposium on Earthquakes, held in Lisbon in 1955: \"Economic aspect of the consideration of the action of earthquakes in the design of buildings\" and \"The collaboration of engineer and architect in the design of anti-seismic constructions\". She was the engineer on the Escola Industrial e Comercial de Oliveira de Azeméis (Industrial and Commercial School) from 1959 to 1963. When she was nearly ninety years old she carried out her last anti-seismic tests, for the building where she lived.\nIn 1938, she was the first woman to join the Order of Engineers, and was its dean in 2012. She was the first woman to sign projects and follow their execution to the end.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nShe was honoured by her alma mater Instituto Superior Técnico in 2011, during a ceremony that brought together the first women in Técnico's history.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe married aged 28, to General Afonso Pinto de Magalhães Galvão Mexia de Almeida Fernandes, who was also an engineer.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ahmad Mashhur al-Haddad (Arabic: أحمد مشهور بن طه الحداد) was a Sunni Islamic scholar from Qaydun in Wadi Dawan, Yemen. He followed the Ba 'Alawiyya way of teaching and spent years proselytizing in East Africa, where he contributed to the establishment of mosques and schools.\nHe is a descendant of Muhammad's grandson Husayn.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHis father spent long periods in Indonesia and his mother, Safiyyah, raised him. She took him to the Ribat of Qaydun at an early age, a religious school founded by his two uncles. His uncle, Habib Alawi, took him to Tarim to learn from the scholars there. His uncle also took him to Indonesia to meet and learn from great scholars there. In Mukalla he met and learned from Habib Ahmad bin Muhsin al-Haddar, and from him he received his spiritual opening.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1928 he first traveled to East Africa and taught in the main mosque in Zanzibar during Ramadan. He then settled in Mombasa, Kenya to give da'wa. He kept his own small business to remain financially independent. In 1956 he moved to Kampala, Uganda. He learned Swahili but would often preach in Arabic with a translator. In Uganda he confronted what was happening in terms of the mixing of women and men, the non-compliance of Muslim women with the hijab, and their failure to give inheritance to daughters. He confronted secularists and communists among Muslims who studied in schools established by colonial governments. He also strongly confronted the Qadianis and was able to convert some of them to Sunni Islam. Thousands of people from various backgrounds including Africans, Indians, and Arabs flocked to him for his teaching, advice, and du'a. He would spent his time between the two holy mosques (Mecca and Medina) and Africa.He was deeply concerned for the Muslim world as a whole and about various conflicts in Muslim countries to the extent that world events could give him physical symptoms. He represented Uganda at the Muslim World League.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died on Wednesday the 14th of Rajab, 1416 AH (1995 CE). He was buried in Jannat al-Mu'alla.\n\n\n== Works ==\nMiftah al-Jannah (Key to the Garden)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Sufis\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Imam and Preacher al-Habib Ahmad Mashhur al-Haddad: Pages from His Life and Preaching (Arabic, 2003)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cútar manuscripts (in Spanish, Los manuscritos de Cútar) refer to three documents from Islamic Spain that were discovered in 2003 in the village of Cútar in the province of Malaga. The documents, including a copy of the Quran and two other books, had lain hidden behind the wall of an old house for more than 500 years. Subsequent research revealed that the books had been left there by Muhammad Al-Ŷayyār, a jurist (alfaqui) and imam in the then-village of Aquta, around the year 1500.\nAl-Ŷayyār had arrived in Cutar in 1490. After the Catholic reconquest of Spain, he was faced with the choice of conversion or exile. Choosing the latter, and in the hope of returning one day, he decided to secrete the books behind the wall. The books were never recovered by him. They were finally discovered by accident on June 28, 2003, when workers were renovating the house of its current owner Magdalena Santiago, who alerted the authorities.\nThe books were restored and are now kept at the Archivo Histórico Provincial de Málaga. The Quran, which is square in shape, has been dated back to the Almohad period, either the 12th or 13th century, making it one of the two oldest Qurans in Spain. The two other documents were written mainly by Al-Ŷayyār, and contain details of his work as alfaqui of the village, and his accounts of contemporary events such as the fall of Granada in 1492 and the Malaga earthquake of 1494. Facsimiles of the books are also kept at the Monfi museum in Cutar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Japanese invasion of Panay (Filipino: Paglusob ng mga Hapones sa isla ngPanay, Cebuano: Pagsulong sa Hapon sa Panay) on April 16–18, 1942 was the second landing in the Visayas Islands after Fil-American forces surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942. It is the next step to prevent any supplies reach Corregidor Island and control the Visayas waters and established bases for the campaign to invade island of Mindanao to complete the invasion of the Philippines.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the surrender of Luzon Force in Bataan, Imperial Japanese 14th Army has sent two detachments to sieged the Visayas Islands that can be made bases for the invasion of Mindanao. Kawaguchi detachment was sent to capture Cebu and Kawamura detachment followed to sieged Panay. \nSince assuming the command 61st Division and Panay Island commander Colonel Albert F. Christie continued to implement the Operation Baus Au, after the previous commander Brigadier General Bradford Chynoweth assumed the new command of Visayan Force and moved to Cebu in mid-March. 61st Division has added two infantry regiments since February after 61st, 62nd Infantry and 61st Field Artillery was transferred to Mindanao. Its strength has reached to 8,000 personnel, however there was a shortage of rifles, ammunition, and no artillery pieces at all in the island.  \n\n\n=== Invasion ===\nKawamura Detachment under Major General Kawamura Saburo arrived in Panay from Lingayen, Pangasinan on April 12, 1942. It landed on three points of Panay, a group landed in Capiz City, Capiz another group landed in San Jose, Antique and the large group among the three landed in Jaro south of Iloilo City. Colonel Christie's troops retreated inland into the hills and mountain based they prepared for the last four months.  The Panay Force is now waving guerilla warfare doing ambuscades to small Japanese units and raiding Iloilo at night to destroy supplies.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nWith Panay island now in total control of the Japanese, with Panay and Cebu islands in firmed grip of the Japanese. Homma can now launch Kawamura and Kawaguchi Detachments to Mindanao. Kawamura Detachment was replaced by three battalions of 10th Independent Garrison, to prepare for invasion of Mindanao. On April 15, 1942 Major General Kawamura received an order to proceed to Macajalar Bay in Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental. Leaving 10th Independent Garrison in control of Panay.\n\n\n== Surrender ==\nIn May 11, 1942 Colonel Christie received an order from General Sharp who is now the commander of Visayas and Mindanao forces after reconstitution of the previous command. Despite his protest and inquiries he was forced to surrender when General Sharp's emissary Lieutenant Colonel Allen Thayer arrived to enforce the order. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See also ===\n61st Infantry Division\nVisayan Force\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Infantry Regiment (PA)",

        "content": "Mantras is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Katie Pruitt. It was released on April 5, 2024, through Rounder Records and follows her debut studio album Expectations (2020).\n\n\n== Background and singles ==\nMantras was recorded at The Shed in Nashville, Tennessee, and features production by Jake Finch and Collin Pastore. It stands as her most personal work to date and describes the \"full circle journey from self-sabotage to self-compassion\", according to Pruitt. Writing the record forced the singer to stop looking for \"external validation\" and instead turn her focus inward.\nThe lead single \"Blood Related\" was released on November 17, 2023, and showcases Pruitt's signature introspective songwriting about the exploration of complex relationships. The song was followed-up by \"White Lies, White Jesus and You\" on January 11, 2024, a protest song that deals with the \"shedding\" of \"any remaining shame\" caused by the church. On February 22, she shared the song \"All My Friends\" which was inspired by a Christian Wiman poem and deals with the \"evolution of beliefs\" as well as the journey of self-discovery. \"Worst Case Scenario\", a \"personal manifesto\" of acknowledging one's fears without giving them power, was released as the fourth single on March 14.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nKatie Pruitt – lead vocals (all tracks), guitar (tracks 1–9, 11), background vocals (1, 3–11), keyboards (2, 5, 6), glockenspiel (7)\nJake Finch – drums (tracks 1–9), bass guitar (1–7), guitar (1–3, 5, 6, 9), keyboards (1, 3, 5–8); background vocals, pedal steel (1); strings (3, 5, 6), banjo (3), glockenspiel (5), mandolin (6)\nCollin Pastore – guitar (tracks 1–3, 5–9), keyboards (1, 3, 5, 7, 8), pedal steel (1, 5), background vocals (1)\nAnthony da Costa – guitar (tracks 1–3, 9)\nWill Honaker – guitar, keyboards (track 4)\nHadley Kennary – background vocals (tracks 5, 9)\nCamille Faulkner – strings (tracks 6–8)\nJennifer Pruitt – background vocals (track 6)\nTaylor Ivey – bass guitar (track 10)\nKevin McGowan – drums (track 10)\nJohnny Williamson – guitar (track 10)\nKris Donegan – guitar (track 10)\nDave Cohen – keyboards (track 10)\nJess Nolan – background vocals (track 11)\nLaura Epling – string arrangement, strings (track 11)\nMaggie Chaffee – strings (track 11)\nTechnical\n\nCollin Pastore – production, mixing, recording (tracks 1–9)\nJake Finch – production, recording (tracks 1–9)\nWill Honaker – production, recording (track 4)\nJordan Lehning – production, recording (track 10)\nMike Robinson – production, recording (track 11)\nPaul Blakemore – mastering\nGary Paczosa – mixing (tracks 9–11), engineering (all tracks)\n\n\n== References ==",

The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field. Kohli commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings. He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.\nOn 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match. In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs. In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed. The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval. Following his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral. His innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.\nKohli's foray into T20 cricket took place in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80. In September 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (reigning champions of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings. In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory. Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit. Ashish Nehra observed his growth over time and shared his thoughts:\n\nI did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not know him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.\n\n\n=== India Under-19 ===\nIn July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series. Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical prowess. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.  In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw, with a 1–1 score line. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.\nIn February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as \"the innings of the tournament.\" This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award. Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory. In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).\nIn June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo, having played 28 Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint ===\nIn August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a \"surprise call-up\". During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series. On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara. However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.\nFollowing the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008. Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs. In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.\nIn November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches. In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023). Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.\nIn July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title. At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament. Kohli later stated that this tournament was a \"turning point\" in his career.\nIn August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh. In December of that year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka  and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely, which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Rise through the ranks ===\nIn January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event. During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22. He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66. After the match, the Indian captain MS Dhoni stated about Kohli that \"he has grabbed his chances\" and that \"he has matured now.\" Dhoni went on to say that \"To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world.\" Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed for a duck, without facing a single delivery, a rare and unusual mode of dismissal. Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 24 innings. Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75. This poor form was also reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.\nDespite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series. During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession. The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a spot in India's World Cup squad. He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.\n\nKohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats. During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters, and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.\n\nKohli played every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing 275.\n\n\n==== Breakthrough in Test cricket ====\nWhen India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.  Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings. India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball.\nHe got dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series. However, Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj, though he did not get to play in any match of that series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80. His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches. In the last game of the series at Cardiff, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared 170 runs partnership with Rahul Dravid for the third wicket, who was playing his last ODI match. Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings .It was the only century in the series by any player of either team and earned him praise for his \"hard work\" and \"maturity\".\nIn October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90. This included unbeaten knock of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209 run partnership with Gambhir; followed by innings of 86 at Mumbai, both the knocks came in successful run chases. Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series at Mumbai in which he scored a pair of fifties. India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run chase of 270. A knock which raised his reputation as \"an expert of the chase\". Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.\nDuring tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed. While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match at Sydney, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth with scores of 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century, 116 runs in the first innings. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series was described as \"the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists\".\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: ODI ascendancy and ascension to vice-captaincy ===\nIn the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series that India played against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane, both against Sri Lanka. Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare. India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock. Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as \"one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time\". However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series. With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.\n\nKohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performances in Australia. Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored his personal best of 183 from 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. He helped India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history surpassing previous record of 144 by Younis Khan in 2004 and the joint second highest score along with Dhoni  in an ODI run-chase; also became the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both the matches that India won, nonetheless India could not progress to the final of the tournament.\nIn July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka ,106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo, winning man of the match in both games. India won the series 4–1 and Kohli was named player of the series. In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48 ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and yet again won the player of the series award.  He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs he was highest run-getter among Indian batsmen; hitting two fifties during the tournament, against Afghanistan and Pakistan, winning man of the match for both his innings. For his performances he was named in the ICC 'Team of the Tournament'.\nKohli's test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India, between October 2012 and January 2013, with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1. Overcoming his poor run of form, he scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match. However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years. Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is and 4.33 in the ODIs. Troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series. Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75. Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013. India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades. Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series.\n\nIn June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a 144 against Sri Lanka in warm-up match. He scored moderately in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively. In sync India qualified for the semi-finals with an undefeated record. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58* in an eight-wicket win for India. The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 ball, helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory. Kohli was also named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.\n\n\n==== Setting records and post-Tendulkar era ====\nKohli stood in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match; Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches. In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first century as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India. Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013. Kohli was therefore appointed as captain for an entire series . In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award. India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series.\nKohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186 run partnership for second wicket with Rohit Sharma, that came in 17.2 overs. Kohli's innings of 100* helped India chase down the target of 360 with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket at the time while Kohli's knock became the fastest century against Australia and third fastest in a run chase.  In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 . He reached the triple-digit figure in 61 balls, making it the third fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman subsequently became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket. India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.\n\nKohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 . This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series. In the first game of the three-match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six wicket win and won the man of the match. He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 while playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul. India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the series-decider at Kanpur. With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series. India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs including a duck. In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 for the first time, Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. The match ended in a draw and Kohli was awarded man of the match. India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.\n\n\n=== 2014: T20 World Cup and assuming Test-captaincy ===\nDuring New Zealand tour, he averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series. However, his efforts went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match. India then traveled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named the captain for the tournament. Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213 run third wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280. It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh. India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively. Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 while Kohli was named vice-captain. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run chases. In the semi-final, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173. He won the man of the match for this knock. In the final against Sri Lanka India posted the target of 130/4 in which Kohli top scored 77 from 58 balls. Notwithstanding his innings, India lost the match by six wickets. Kohli made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament. For his achievement he won the Man of the Tournament award.\n\nKohli's tour of England was a challenging one, marked by a series of underwhelming performances. He scored a total of 134 runs in the series in 10 innings, at an average of 13.4, with a top score of 39. He found himself dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions, and appeared to struggle particularly with the swinging deliveries aimed at his off stump. This resulted in several dismissals by means of edges caught by the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. James Anderson, who was named Man of the Series, was particularly successful in dismissing Kohli, accounting for four of his wickets. Kohli's technique and ability as a batsman were subjected to analysis and critique from cricket experts and former players after the series. Despite India emerging victorious in the following ODI series by 3–1, Kohli's batting performance did not see significant improvement. He scored with an average of 18 runs in four innings, in the ODI series. However, in the single T20I match, he exhibited a resurgence with a 41-ball 66, marking his first score of over 50 during the tour. Despite India's defeat in the match by a margin of three runs, Kohli's performance earned him the top position in the ICC T20I batsmen rankings.\n\nKohli had a successful time during India's home ODI series win over the West Indies in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February and he stated that he got his \"confidence back\" with the innings.  Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and showed moderate batting display in the first four ODIs with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, he made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka. Kohli was awarded player of the series and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy. During the series he became the fastest batsman in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs, at the time. With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years.\nFor the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time. Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut. In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top-score.\nDhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, he made his personal best Test score (of that time) of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262 runs partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney. Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli scored 147 runs in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests is the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: World Cups and limited-over success ===\nKohli's form in the lead-up to the World Cup was not at its peak, as evidenced by his scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan. Despite his less-than-stellar form in the warm-up matches, Kohli was able to rise to the occasion and deliver a commanding performance in the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide by scoring 107 runs from 126 deliveries. This feat earned him the man of the match award and established him as the first Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in a World Cup match. In India's second match of the tournament, against South Africa, Kohli was dismissed for a score of 46. Despite this setback, India went on to secure a commanding 130-run victory in the match.

He scored another double hundred, 211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings.\n\n\n=== 2017–2018: Dominant batting and leadership ===\nKohli got double centuries in the next two Test series against England and Bangladesh, making him the first batsman ever to score double centuries in four consecutive series. He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he scored his then-highest Test score of 235.\nKohli got the chance to captain in an ICC tournament for the first time in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.

With this win, India equaled Australia for the record streak of nine consecutive series wins in Test cricket. He ended the year with 2818 international runs, which is recorded as the third-highest tally ever in a calendar year and the highest tally ever by an Indian player. The ICC named Kohli as captain of both their World Test XI and ODI XI for 2017.

This included three centuries, remaining unbeaten in two with a best of 160*. India won the ODI series 5–1 and Kohli became the first Indian captain to win an ODI series in South Africa.\n\nIn March 2018, Kohli showed interest to play county cricket in England in June in order to improve his batting before the start of India's tour to England the following month.

The Guardian described Kohli's batting display as \"one of the greatest batting displays in a losing cause.\"During ODI series against West Indies in 2018, Kohli accomplished a noteworthy achievement. He became the twelfth batsman to amass 10,000 ODI runs in ODIs and achieved this feat at an unprecedented pace, he surpassed this landmark in 54 fewer innings than Sachin Tendulkar, the player who holds the record for being the second-fastest to the landmark. In the course he scored his 37th ODI century. On 27 October, after scoring his 38th ODI century Kohli became the first batsman for India, first captain and tenth overall to score three successive centuries in ODIs.

His knock of 123 was his 6th hundred in three tours to Australia making him the only Indian to score 6 test hundreds in Australia after Sachin Tendulkar. He also became the fastest Indian and second fastest overall (125 innings) to score 25 test hundreds, second only to Donald Bradman (68 innings); which was bettered by Steven Smith during 2019 Ashes (119 innings). Kohli's knock was rated by several analysts and former cricketers as one of his finest against a quality Australian attack. Although he broke several records in the game his innings proved to be insufficient as India went down by 146 runs as Australia leveled the series with two tests remaining. Overall, he finished the series with 282 runs at an average of 40. By winning the test series in Australia he had become the first Indian and also the first Asian skipper to win a test series in Australia.

Throughout the series, he was troubled by swinging deliveries and edged many deliveries, outside the off-stump, to the slip-fielders and wicket-keeper. Despite his batting woes, India won two of the four matches, with \nKohli becoming the 2nd captain after Kapil Dev to win two tests in a series in England.\n\n\n==== Retirement from captaincy across formats ====\nIn September 2021, Kohli was named as the captain of India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. However, Kohli also publicly announced his decision to step down from the role of T20I captain following the tournament's conclusion. India was unable to advance to the semi-final round, marking the first time in a period of 9 years that India had been excluded from the tournament's latter stages.\nIn December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. The BCCI President, Sourav Ganguly, disclosed that Kohli's removal from the ODI captaincy was attributed to the selectors decision to avoid having two leaders for the white ball format. However, he also conveyed that Kohli was asked to remain the captain of the T20I. During a press conference, Kohli disputed the BCCI President's statement, affirming that his decision to step down from the captaincy was \"well-received\" and viewed as a \"positive move\" by the BCCI officials. Kohli also claimed that he was informed about his dismissal from the ODI captaincy by the chief selector, Chetan Sharma, 90 minutes before the announcement of the Test squad for India's tour of South Africa. More than a week later, during the announcement of the squad for the ODI series against South Africa, Chetan Sharma refuted Kohli's claim and stated that the officials had urged him to reconsider his decision to relinquish his role as T20I captain.\nLater in 2021 and early 2022, the Indian cricket team toured South Africa for a 3-match test series and a 3-match ODI series.

He later said in post match presentation that:\n\n\"Last two and a half years have taught me a lot. I am going to turn 34 in a month. So those angry celebrations are a thing of the past. I have had many suggestions, lot of advice has come my way; people were telling me I was doing this wrong, that wrong, I picked out all the videos from the best time I had; same initial movement, same approach towards the ball and it was just what was happening inside my head I wasn't able to explain it to anyone\"He carried his good form into the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In the first game against Pakistan, Kohli scored 82* and won the match for his team by a close margin. He rated this as his best innings in the format due to the magnitude which the game had.

He made a century against Bangladesh and a 95 against New Zealand.\nKohli reached a significant milestone on November 2, 2023, during the World Cup match against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. He accomplished the feat of scoring the most number of 1000 runs in a calendar year. This marked the eighth time in Kohli's career that he achieved this milestone, surpassing the previous record held by Sachin Tendulkar, who had scored 1000 or more runs seven times in his career. In the following match against South Africa on 5 November 2023, which was also Kohli's 35th birthday, he scored his 49th century in 277 innings, equaling Tendulkar's record of 49 centuries in 438 innings.

Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.\n\n\n==== 2008–2009: Early seasons ====\nIn the inaugural match of the IPL, Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he fell early to a dismissal, contributing a single run to the team's pursuit of a target of 223 runs. As the tournament progressed, Kohli found himself occupying a position in the middle order, but his impact in this role was relatively limited, prompting a strategic decision to reinstate him at the top order during the match against the Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to his team's cause. However, in the last two games of the tournament, Kohli had to sacrifice his preferred position in order to accommodate Misbah-ul-Haq, taking on the responsibility of batting in the middle order once again. Concluding the season, Kohli's individual performance yielded a total of 165 runs, as Bangalore secured the seventh position on the points table.\n\nIn the subsequent season, Kohli encountered a series of low scores in the initial two matches before bouncing back with a half-century in the third match against Deccan Chargers, in team's defeat. Throughout the remainder of the season, Kohli displayed moderate performances or found limited opportunities to bat, owing to the dominance of top-order batsmen Jacques Kallis and Ross Taylor. This proved advantageous for the team, as they secured a spot in the playoffs. In the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli made crucial contributions to the team's successful chase, propelling Bangalore to the final. In final against Deccan Charges, Kohli got stumped for 7 as Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, thus concluding the season as runners-up.\n\n\n==== 2010–2012: Rise, retention and realization ====\nIn the 2010 season of the IPL, Kohli, assuming the role of vice-captain for the Bangalore, was positioned strategically in the middle order. He augmented Bangalore's batting depth and made notable contributions to the team's success. Notably, his contribution was observed during a victory over the Kings XI Punjab, where he played an instrumental role in concluding the match.\nHis cameos in away fixtures against the Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab, forging valuable partnerships, particularly with Kevin Pietersen, were crucial. Kohli's standout performance came in futile encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored 58 runs at a strike rate of 165. As the season progressed, Kohli's fielding prowess also came to the fore, augmenting his contribution to the team's cause. Upon securing a place in the playoffs, the Bangalore team confronted Mumbai Indians in the semi-final. Bangalore suffered a setback, succumbing to a defeat margin of 35 runs, as Kohli's contribution was limited to a tally of 7 runs in Bangalore's total, thereby ending Bangalore's campaign in the tournament. In the Champions League Twenty20 held in September, the Bangalore team found themselves in an encounter against the Mumbai Indians. In pursuit of a target of 165 runs, Kohli played a steady innings, contributing 47 runs. The match came down to the final ball, which resulted in Kohli's dismissal, leading to Bangalore falling short by a margin of 2 runs. As a consequence, their upcoming game against the Lions became a virtual knockout match. In this must-win encounter, Kohli scored 49* runs, guiding his team to victory and securing a place in the semi-finals. In the semi-final clash against the Chennai Super Kings, Bangalore faced a significant defeat of 52 runs(D/L method).\nPrior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an amount of US$1.8 million. In the opening match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kohli started his campaign with a score of 23 runs. He registered his first half-century of the season against the Deccan Chargers, in pursuit of what was then the second-highest run chase, however Bangalore fell short by 33 runs. After lacklustre start for Bangalore, winning two out of their first six matches, Kohli scored 56 runs in the next match against the Delhi Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for the first time in the tournament. In the subsequent match, he continued his form against the Pune Warriors, where he claimed his second player of the match award. It was during this match that Kohli became the leading run-scorer of the season, donning the Orange cap for the short time, and he also surpassed the milestone of 1000 runs in the IPL. During the mid-tournament, with regular captain Daniel Vettori sustaining an injury, Kohli had the opportunity to captain his side for the first time in an IPL match. Team's coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli for his efforts, acknowledged his potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise but also of the Indian national team. The team ended their league stage campaign on a high note, defeating the Chennai Super Kings and securing the top position on the points table. In the first qualifier, Kohli scored 70 of 44 balls. Setting a target of 175 runs, Bangalore failed to defend, resulting in knockout match against the Mumbai Indians. In the knockout match, Bangalore triumphed over Mumbai, securing their place in the IPL final for the second time. In the final, chasing a target of 205 runs, Kohli contributed 35 runs to the team's total. However, Bangalore once again fell short in their pursuit of the title. During the season, Kohli amassed 557 runs, including four half-centuries, and earning the distinction of being the second-highest run-scorer of the season, trailing West-Indian teammate Chris Gayle. In the Champions League, Bangalore encountered a defeat in their first match against the Warriors. In the following match, Kohli got dismissed for a duck, leading to another loss for Bangalore. To secure a spot in the semi-finals, they needed to win their remaining two matches. In their last group-stage match against the Southern Redbacks, Kohli showcased his aggressive batting by scoring 70 runs off just 36 balls, propelling Bangalore into the semi-finals. In the semi-final clash against the New South Wales Blues, Kohli once again played match-winning innings, scoring an unbeaten 84 runs. However, in the final showdown against the Mumbai Indians, Bangalore suffered a defeat by a margin of 31 runs.\n\nIn the 2012 season of the IPL, Kohli registered single-digit scores in the first two matches before bouncing back in the third match against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring 57 runs. He struggled to maintain consistency in subsequent matches, reaching a total of 165 runs by the ninth game. Kohli did manage to contribute 45 runs in the following match against the Kings XI Punjab to his team's cause. As the season progressed, ineffectiveness of Bangalore's captain, Daniel Vettori, as a player led to a strategic alteration. Vettori made the decision to step down as captain and handed the leadership role to Kohli for the remaining matches of the season. His breakthrough performance in the season came during the match against the Delhi Daredevils where he scored 73* and formed a record-breaking partnership of 203 runs with his teammate Gayle. In their final match of the season, Bangalore faced the Deccan Chargers with the necessity of must-win to qualify for the playoffs. Kohli contributed 42 runs to the team's chase before being dismissed in the 16th over. His dismissal triggered a collapse in Bangalore's batting order, resulting in their eventual defeat and elimination from the tournament during the group stage. During the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 364 runs, garnered over the course of 16 matches. He returned from the League with a sense of disillusionment with his own performance and was dissatisfied with the state of his game. He recognized the need for improvement and adaptation to the evolving dynamics of cricket.\n\n\n==== 2013–2014: Leadership role and tribulations in batting ====\nFollowing Vettori's retirement, Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for the Bangalore team starting from the 2013 season of the IPL. Prior to the commencement of this season, he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of 1,639 runs. Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game. In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time. Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over. After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium. As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings. He bounced back during the away game against Delhi, where he came close to achieving a century, scoring 99 before being run out on the final delivery. With a strong start to the season that saw Bangalore occupying the top position in the table, the team's performance waned in the latter half of the tournament. Kohli openly addressed the issue, attributing their decline to a lack of execution by the bowling unit. In a bid to keep their playoff hopes alive, Bangalore confronted a must-win scenario in their final match against Chennai. Opening the innings, Kohli scored an unbeaten 56 in a rain-affected match, ultimately leading his team to victory. However, Bangalore's hopes were shattered when the Hyderabad secured a win over the Kolkata Knight Riders, dashing their chances of advancing to the playoffs. As a result, Bangalore's season came to an end during the group stage.\n\nPrior to the seventh season of the IPL, Kohli was retained by Bangalore for ₹12.5 crore (US$1.6 million). His campaign commenced with an unbeaten score of 49 runs in a victorious encounter against the Delhi Daredevils. However, Kohli struggled to maintain his form and faced a dismissal without scoring in the second match. In a match against the Rajasthan Royals, Bangalore's batting lineup faltered, resulting in them being bowled out for 70, then third-lowest total in IPL history. Kohli contributed 21 runs to the team's total in that particular match. Bangalore heavily relied on the performances of Gayle and Kohli in their batting lineup, but neither of them had managed a significant innings thus far in the season. Kohli's struggles persisted as he recorded his third duck of the season in a match against the Kings XI Punjab. In an effort to address the batting woes, Kohli made the decision to alter his batting position and open the innings; however, this adjustment did not yield the desired outcome. With Bangalore losing six out of their nine games, Kohli had yet to reach the milestone of scoring a half-century. Meanwhile, the team was striving to secure victories in their remaining matches in order to qualify for the playoffs. In his twelfth game of the season against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kohli achieved his first fifty of the season. However, the subsequent defeat to the Kolkata Knight Riders, with Kohli contributing 38 runs before being dismissed by Sunil Narine for the second time, led to Bangalore's elimination from playoff contention for the third consecutive time. In their final match of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, Kohli showcased his best performance of the season, accumulating 73 runs. However, Bangalore suffered a defeat in that match. Despite the team's challenges, Kohli's popularity continued to soar, making him the most-searched player on the internet during the tournament.\n\n\n==== 2015–2016: Collective and individual success ====\n\nAt the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team. Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign. Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings. In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak. During this match, he promoted AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's premier batsman face more deliveries. Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase. However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore's loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak. His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, forming a then record partnership of 215 runs with de Villiers. In a rain-affected match against the Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, earning him player of the match award. In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach's absence of severity. Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league. However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.\nIn the 2016 season of the IPL, Kohli's campaign began with 75 runs, contributing to a victory of 45 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. He continued his run in the subsequent match, scoring 79 runs. Throughout the early matches, Kohli consistently achieved the milestone of scoring half-centuries in three out of the four matches he played, while sharing three century partnerships with de Villiers. In the encounter against the Gujarat Lions, he registered his first century in Twenty20 cricket. Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli's knock earned him the player of the match. Despite Kohli's performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table. To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising Pune Supergiant as Bangalore's virtual knockouts began. He continued to deliver match-winning performances, forming a record partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat, followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders. In a rain-affected match against the Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 4,000 runs in the league. His batting drew high praise from Harsha Bhogle, who lauded his technical proficiency and shot-making. Kohli's consistent performances propelled Bangalore to the playoffs, as he scored four consecutive fifty-plus scores in must-win matches and finished the league stage with tally of 919 runs. In the playoffs, Bangalore faced Gujarat in the first qualifier. Kohli was dismissed for a duck in that match, however his team emerged victorious, setting up a final against the Hyderabad. Kohli contributed 54 runs in Bangalore's pursuit of target of 209 in the final. Notwithstanding, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, leaving him to acknowledge the Hyderabad team's performance and express his gratitude to the Bangalore crowd for their support. Kohli concluded the season with record 973 runs in 16 matches, at an average of 81.08, establishing himself as the highest run-scorer of the tournament and claiming Orange Cap with the title of Most Valuable Player. Team's coach, Vettori, praised Kohli for his contributions, stating:\n\nVirat has been phenomenal. When you have got a guy at the top of the order who takes that much control and his performances are that great, it allows things to flow from there. Obviously a great captain does that — leads with his performance and he has been exceptional not only with his batting, but also fielding and leadership.\n\n\n==== 2017–2019: Fluctuating form and captaincy struggles ====\n\nIn the lead-up to the tenth season of the IPL, Kohli grappled with a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the initial three fixtures of the tournament. Upon his return in the fourth match against the Mumbai Indians, he scored 62 runs, albeit in a defeat for Bangalore. Following this performance, Kohli delivered moderately in the subsequent two matches. However, in the face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders, Kohli faced a setback after being dismissed for a duck as Bangalore stumbled to league's lowest score of 49 runs. He promptly criticized the batting display as reckless. In the encounter against the Rising Pune Supergiant, Kohli contributed 55 runs to his team's total of 96 runs. Expressing disappointment, Kohli attributed the team's struggles to a lack of intent and a fearful batting approach. With Bangalore facing defeat in seven out of their ten matches, their hopes for playoffs were dashed, particularly after their loss to the Mumbai Indians, making them the first team to be eliminated from contention. Wrapping up the tournament, Bangalore secured a victory in their last match against Delhi Daredevils, with Kohli scoring his fourth fifty of the season and amassing a total of 308 runs in 10 innings. Kohli concluded that the season as a whole was the team's most underwhelming performance to date. Commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the league, ESPNcricinfo honoured Kohli by including him in the all-time IPL-XI.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the 2018 season, Bangalore retained Kohli for sum of ₹17 crore (US$2.1 million), making him the league's most expensive player at the time. His campaign began with 33 runs in a defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he expressed his discontentment with the number of dot balls he faced. In contrast to his individual performances, which included twin fifties in the third and fourth matches, temporarily securing him the Orange Cap, Bangalore found themselves consistently on the losing side. This predicament was primarily attributed to the team's heavy reliance on Kohli and his partner de Villiers in the batting lineup, coupled with their challenges in the bowling department, which Kohli critiqued as being \"criminal\". As the tournament progressed, Bangalore gradually discovered their winning rhythm, propelled by Kohli's contributions, including scores of 70 and 48* in must-win encounters against Delhi Daredevils and Kings XI Punjab, respectively. He eventually surpassed the milestone of 500 runs in the season, a feat he accomplished for a record fifth time. However, in the decisive encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli faltered, managing 4 runs before succumbing to dismissal. This setback ultimately led to Bangalore's elimination from the tournament. In the aftermath of their exit, Kohli publicly scrutinized the team's middle-order batsmen for their failure to deliver substantial contributions during crucial matches, reflecting on the missed opportunities that defined their campaign.\nKohli's start to the 2019 season proved underwhelming, as he managed 6 runs in the opener against the Chennai Super Kings. Consequently, he opted to move down the batting order in an attempt to provide more depth. However, his struggle with form persisted, reflecting in Bangalore's losses and prompting a quick reversal of the decision. In an encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli marked his 100th appearance as Bangalore's captain. Albeit, that match ended in defeat, extending the team's losing streak to four consecutive matches. Former cricketer Gautam Gambhir weighed in on Kohli's lengthy tenure as captain, suggesting luck may have played a part despite his underwhelming performance as leader. Kohli eventually found his rhythm in the fifth match, where he managed to score a half-century against the Kolkata Knight Riders. However, Bangalore's string of losses persisted, prompting him to acknowledge his team's lackluster performance thus far. After enduring record six consecutive defeats, Bangalore secured their first victory against the Kings XI Punjab, with Kohli contributing 67 runs in that match. Subsequently, he scored his fifth century in the league; however, his subsequent form saw a dip, as he struggled to make significant contributions with the bat in Bangalore's successive victories. These wins, were not enough as Bangalore fell short in their bid to advance further in the tournament, marking their third consecutive elimination under Kohli's captaincy. Reflecting on the season, he expressed satisfaction with the team's turnaround in the latter stages of the tournament, acknowledging the progress made despite their early challenges.\n\n\n==== 2020–2022: Performance plunge and captaincy departure ====\nFollowing the resumption of cricket post the COVID-19 lockdown, Kohli returned to the field with cautious optimism. However, positioned at number 3, his start to the 2020 season was lackluster, tallying a total of 18 runs across the first three matches. In the fourth match, Kohli found his rhythm, and scored 72 runs against the Rajasthan Royals. His momentum continued as he played his standout innings of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring an unbeaten 90. Throughout the season, Kohli adhered to a strategy of accumulating runs primarily through singles and doubles, thereby minimizing the reliance on boundaries. Under his captaincy, Bangalore secured victories in five of their opening eight matches, with Kohli himself contributing moderately, amassing a total of 389 runs by the conclusion of eleven matches. However, during the latter part of the season, Kohli's form dipped, coinciding with Bangalore's consecutive losses in four matches following their promising start. Despite these setbacks, Bangalore managed to qualify for the playoffs due to their net run rate. Kohli concluded the league stage with a cumulative total of 460 runs, albeit with a slower strike rate of 122. Analysts at ESPNcricinfo attributed this performance in part to the distinctive conditions of the season, notably the relocation of matches to the UAE, where larger boundaries and an inexperienced middle order might have influenced Kohli's risk-averse approach. In the playoffs, Bangalore encountered the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator. Kohli, assuming the opening position alongside Devdutt Padikkal, encountered an early setback, scoring 7 runs before his dismissal. Bangalore succumbed in the knockout encounter, prompting Kohli to reflect on a palpable sense of nervousness among the players, which contributed to their defeat.\n\nAhead of the 2021 season opener, Kohli emphasized the strategic advantages of neutral venues for his team. In their inaugural match against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli commenced with a score of 33, which he replicated in the subsequent fixture. Notably, his first half-century of the season came against the Rajasthan Royals, where he scored an unbeaten 72, leading Bangalore to secure victory in four consecutive encounters. Upon the resumption of the league in September, Kohli became the first player to make 200 appearances for a singular franchise. Concurrently, Kohli announced his intention to relinquish the captaincy of Bangalore at the season's end, this decision was met with speculation, with Sandip of The Indian Express suggesting that it could potentially afford Kohli to play with more freedom. In subsequent fixtures, Kohli scored consecutive half-centuries against the Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai, his innings against the latter also marked the completion of 10,000 runs in T20 cricket. As the tournament progressed, Bangalore qualified for the playoffs, with two games to spare, attributed to performances by Glenn Maxwell and Harshal Patel in their respective domains. However, Kohli experienced a dip in form leading up to the playoffs, as Bangalore prepared to face Kolkata Knight Riders in the eliminator. In the knockout clash, where he notched up 39 runs, Bangalore was unable to secure victory, thus concluding Kohli's tenure as captain. In his post-match discourse, Kohli reaffirmed his commitment to delivering his utmost for Bangalore, while expressing gratitude for the loyalty and support extended by the franchise.\nPrior to the onset of the 2022 season, Bangalore chose to retain Kohli for a sum of ₹15 crore (US$1.9 million). With Faf Du Plessis taking over the captaincy reins, Kohli commenced the season with a score of 41* against the Punjab Kings. However, positioned at number 3, Kohli's subsequent innings were marked by inconsistency, with sole significant contribution of 48 runs against the Mumbai Indians. Struggling to regain his form, Kohli endured two consecutive ducks in matches against the Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad. By the seventh match of the season, Kohli found himself registering single-digit scores in four out of seven matches, accumulating a total of 119 runs at an average of 17. Cricket analyst Jarrod Kimber, writing for ESPNcricinfo, remarked that Kohli's batting seemed enigmatic and uncertain. In an attempt to rectify his batting woes, Kohli was elevated to the opening position alongside du Plessis. It was in the tenth match that he managed to secure his maiden half-century of the season, albeit in 45 balls, marking it as his slowest in the T20 format. However, his struggles persisted, as he encountered another duck against Hyderabad, accumulating a total of 216 runs in twelve matches. Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri expressed his apprehension, suggesting that Kohli appeared \"overcooked\" and advocated for a break to rejuvenate himself. In concurrence with Shastri's assessment, Kohli asserted that he did not feel the need to prove himself to anyone and believed in his ability to bounce back. As the tournament progressed, Bangalore found themselves in a precarious position, requiring a victory in their final league match to remain in contention for the playoffs. Kohli rose to the occasion, scoring 73 runs against Gujarat Titans, and propelling Bangalore to victory. However, Kohli faltered in the subsequent eliminator and qualifier 2, spelling the culmination of Bangalore's campaign.\n\n\n==== 2023–present: Return to form ====\nIn the 2023 season, Kohli commenced his campaign with a score of 82* runs against the Mumbai Indians. He maintained his form in subsequent matches, registering fifties in three out of the first four matches. Kohli's batting approach during this period was marked by aggression in the powerplay overs, followed by a more cautious approach in the middle overs of the game. Reflecting on this tactical shift, Kohli noted that the middle overs are when teams typically introduce their premier bowlers, necessitating the assessment of the game's evolving dynamics. Moreover, in the absence of regular captain du Plessis, Kohli assumed the role of stand-in captain for several matches, while du Plessis contributed as an impact player. Eight matches into the season, Kohli had scored fifties in five of them. However, an altercation marred a match against the Lucknow Super Giants, where Kohli found himself in a confrontation with Gambhir, resulting in a fine for breaching the code of conduct. Throughout the season, Kohli relied on his placement and running between the wickets to maintain a scoring rate above a run a ball. As the season progressed, Bangalore needed victories in their final two games to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Kohli stepped up in a pivotal match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, scoring a century, to secure a win for his team. In the subsequent fixture, he scored another century, surpassing Gayle for the most centuries in the league. However, Bangalore fell short in defending their total, leading to their elimination from the tournament. Kohli concluded the season with a tally of 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bai Chen (Chinese: 白沉; 22 May 1922 – 5 November 2002), born Tian Zuheng (Chinese: 田祖恒), was a Chinese film director, screenwriter, and actor.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Suzhou, the son of a Hanlin Academy member, Bai became orphan of both parents when he was 11. He started his career on stage while being in high school, and during the World War II he served as an actor for the troupes. After working as an actor in Shangai,  in 1946 he moved to Hong Kong, where he served as assistant director of Zhu Shilin, and started appearing in small roles in films. \nBai made his directorial debut in 1949, specializing in opera films.  Because of his political positions, he was expelled from Hong Kong in 1952, and returned to Shanghai, where was put under contract at Shanghai Film Studio. In 1955, he had a major hit with the war-drama Storm on the Southern Island. In 1956, he formed the \"Society of Five Flowers\" together with collegues Xie Jin, Xu Changlin and  Yang Hua, with the aim of collaborating and supporting each other's project. \nFollowing the launch of the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Bai was marked as a Rightist and sent to Anhui to work as a farm labourer.  After collaborating with the Anhui Provincial Drama Troupe, in 1979 he was able to return to Shangai and reprise his career, making his official comeback with Ten Days, released in 1980.  His 1983 film Under the Bridge was entered into the 41st Venice International Film Festival, and was the first chapter in his critically acclaimed \"Women's Trilogy\", also consisting of Spring in the Autumn (1985), and Wind Coming Down the Mountains (1990).  These final three films won several accolades, and contribued to launch the careers of actresses Gong Xue and Song Jia.  He died on 5 November 2002, at the age of 80.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBai Chen at IMDb",

        "content": "NGC 2911 is a peculiar lenticular galaxy in the constellation Leo. The galaxy lies about 145 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2911 is approximately 165,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 11, 1784.The galaxy features dust lanes. The kinematic axis of the molecular gas of the galaxy isn't aligned with the stellar one, indicating it is of external origin. The nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active and it is categorised as a type 2 LINER. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The supermassive black hole in the nucleus of NGC 5953 is estimated to have a mass of 2.7×108 M☉ based on stellar velocity dispersion. A one-sided jet measuring about half parsec in length is visible in radiowaves.NGC 2911 is the foremost member of a galaxy group known as NGC 2911 group or LGG 177. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 2912, NGC 2913, NGC 2914, and NGC 2939. NGC 2912 lies at a distance of 1.3 arcminutes while NGC 2914 lies at a distance of 4.8 arcminutes. NGC 2919 appears next to the group but it isn't a member of it. A bit further away from the NGC 2911 group lies NGC 2872 and its group, the UGC 5189 group and the CGCG 063-066 group.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNGC 1947 - a similar galaxy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 2911 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "The Tahmasp I's campaigns in Kartli and Kakheti was a series of campaigns of the Safavid Iran under the leadership of Shah Tahmasp I against the Georgian Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti.\nGeorgia was one of the regions that sparked the interest of Shah Tahmasp. One of the reasons for this was to diminish the power of the Ustajlu tribe, who held the territories of present-day southern Georgia and Armenia, although another motive was plunder. Attacks on predominantly Christian Georgian territories were often motivated by jihad. During Shah Tahmasp's initial march, Tbilisi was plundered, its churches, Georgian nobles' wealth, children, and wives were seized as booty. Additionally, eventually, the rulers of cities like Tbilisi and Golbada were compelled to accept Shiism. King Luarsab of Kartli managed to escape and hide during Tahmasp's marches. The objective of the second march was to establish stable Qizilbash rule in Georgian territories. Again, through raids and plundering observed during the march, King Levan of Kakheti was subdued, and he pledged allegiance to the Shah. Another march took place a year before the Treaty of Amasya. In each of these marches, along with a considerable amount of booty seized, Qizilbash forces also obtained numerous captives upon their return. Sources report that in one march, 30,000 captives were seized. Among these captives was Luarsab's mother, Nestan Darejan, who committed suicide after being taken captive. Some of these captives later managed to integrate into the Safavid bureaucracy.\nIn 1555, according to the Treaty of Amasya, Eastern Georgia remained under the rule of the Qizilbash. In subsequent campaigns, Shah Tahmasp did not personally participate; instead, the representation of Qizilbash rule in the region was entrusted to Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoghlu Qajar. He generally ruled over the territories north of the Aras River. To maintain his authority in the region, Tahmasp sought to convert influential figures in Kartli and Kakheti to Shiism. For example, David Khan, brother of Simon I, serves as an example. Prince Jesse, the son of Levan of Kakheti, also came to Qazvin in the 1560s and embraced Shiism. In return, Shah Tahmasp bestowed gifts and positions upon him. He was given a palace in Qazvin and appointed as the ruler of Sheki and its surrounding areas. The conversion of these Georgian princes to Shiism did not hinder Kartli rulers like Luarsab I and his son Simon from continuing their resistance against the Qizilbash, who were attempting to regain Tbilisi. The outcome of the Battle of Qarisi, where these Georgian rulers fought against the Qizilbash, did not result in a decisive victory.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMilitary campaigns to Georgia, primarily centered around Azerbaijan and Eastern Anatolia-based states, had become commonplace since the 15th century and even earlier. Shah Ismail's father, Uzun Hasan of the Aq Qoyunlu, conducted major campaigns into Georgia on three occasions—1458, 1461, and 1476. Shah Ismail himself, even after the defeat at the Battle of Chaldiran, sent armies into Georgian territories. Several reasons contributed to these frequent campaigns, with the primary one being the geographical location of the region. The rivalry between the Ottoman and Safavid empires motivated them to create a buffer zone, and Georgia served as such a region. During Tahmasp 's reign, one of the reasons for the campaigns was the necessity for plunder within the Qizilbash army. However, the main reason for his initial campaign was entirely different; it aimed to elevate the cohesion and combat morale within the Qizilbash army by successfully conducting a military campaign. The lack of political and military unity in the fragmented Georgian kingdoms made them easy targets for the larger and more organized armies of the Ottomans and Safavids.\nThe Christian population of Georgia served as legitimate targets for surrounding Turkic-Muslim states. These states often utilized jihad as a means to secure their political legitimacy, allowing them to impose taxes and levies on non-Muslim populations. However, the religious and political confrontation between the two empires in border territories did not diminish in importance; military operations in the region were often necessary to showcase imperial power and strengthen their claims of legitimacy. Furthermore, during this period, the Safavid state was highly militarized, and warfare was considered a natural and noble way of life for the Qizilbash warriors who fulfilled these duties. It was in warfare that they could demonstrate their courage, sacrifices, and honor. War also provided opportunities for enrichment and acquiring vast territories. Tahmasp appointed his commanders who participated in these campaigns to key state positions, and they, in turn, distributed the spoils of war among their supporters. All these factors served as strong motivations for expansion into the Caucasus, and the Safavid high command believed that these benefits outweighed the direct confrontation risk with the Ottomans in the region.\n\n\n=== First march ===\nShah Tahmasp's first campaign into Georgian territory occurred in 1541 when he was 27 years old. By this time, he had consolidated all his power and placed his trusted individuals from the Qizilbash elite in positions of authority throughout the provinces. At the beginning of this campaign, internal civil war had ceased, stability had been established on the eastern borders through victories over the Uzbeks in 1539, and it had been six years since the conclusion of Süleyman's campaign from 1533 to 1535. Kartli and Kakheti kingdoms bore the brunt of Safavid incursions during Tahmasp's reign (and later during the reign of his grandson, Abbas I). On the other hand, the Principality of Samtskhe, taking advantage of its geographical distance to avoid the risks of direct military confrontation and maintain its independence, engaged in political dialogue with the Safavids. Kartli Kingdom, ruled by the Bagrationi dynasty, had a powerful ruler from the direct lineage of King Luarsab named King I Luarsab, who held sway over several autonomous states like Sabaratiano, Saamilaxvaro, and Satsitsiano. He was a staunch adversary of Shah Tahmasp during this period and vigorously resisted the Safavids' attempts to establish dominance in Kartli and neighboring regions.\nThe Safavid sources of the period do not distinguish between the Georgian kingdoms; in these sources, the general designation for the region is the term \"Georgia.\" However, by noting rulers or well-known cities (such as Qori or Tbilisi), one can determine which specific kingdom is being referred to. According to these sources, the primary motive for initiating these campaigns was nothing other than the \"holy war\" (jihad) against the infidels. Hasan-bey Rumlu, in his chronicle, writes: \"In defense of the faith and the victory of Shah Islam and the strengthening of the Prophet's religion, fearless armies marched to Georgia.\" On the other hand, Armenian chronicler Zakaria Kanakertsi mentions that the Georgians were the cause of the initial invasion, as they \"attacked and plundered any Iranian who came to Tbilisi.\" In 1541, Qizilbash forces advanced from Karabakh to Tbilisi, the capital of the Kartli kingdom under the rule of King Luarsab. Just two years prior to the Safavid invasion, Michel Membray, the Venetian envoy who passed through Georgia, wrote:\n\nAccording to his (King Luarsab's) nobles, he has approximately 5,000 cavalrymen called aznavurs... The mentioned city of Tbilisi is very large, but as a result of numerous wars, a large part of it has been destroyed. The aforementioned King Luarsab pays an annual tribute of 1,000 ducats to Shah Tahmasp.According to Membray's information, the Kingdom of Kakheti had paid tribute to the Safavid Empire at least until 1538. Hasan bey Rumlu, who participated in Shah Tahmasp's first campaign to Georgia, provides more detailed information compared to other available sources. According to his writings, the Qizilbash army reached the city of Tbilisi at night and immediately launched an attack on the city. One of Luarsab's commanders, Kalbad-i Gurji, was in Tbilisi with his fighters and intended to resist. Eventually, he was defeated, and the city was captured by the Qizilbash. The captured city was plundered, and the people were taken as captives. Another Georgian commander, Habs Bartis, fled to the fortress of Habs Bartis but was eventually defeated. Those who converted to Islam, including Kalbad, survived, while those who did not immediately were executed. The Qizilbash army began marching along the banks of the Kura River to capture Luarsab and his people. The army quickly returned to Tabriz with victories and numerous captives. A notable feature of these campaigns was the siege of fortresses in Georgian principalities. In fact, the success of each round of military attacks depended on the capture of the chain of fortresses controlling the territory. The stone fortress was a symbol of the military aristocracy of Georgia—it was the center of their political and administrative apparatus and the basis of their military power in the region. In other words, to dominate the region, it was necessary to first control the central fortress of that region. During these campaigns, the fortress was the strongest, most threatening, and dominant structure that Safavid forces encountered in Georgian villages. Capturing the fortress was essential to break the power of Georgian armed forces in any specific area and played a significant role in these campaigns.\nSafavids' successful campaign in 1541 was indeed significant. Despite facing numerous challenges in battles against the superior Ottoman army, the rise in morale of the Qizilbash army contributed to this outcome. Correspondingly, this victory brought great personal benefits to Shah Tahmasp himself, as it reflected the increasing power and influence of his armed forces. During this period, Shah Tahmasp needed military success to enhance his personal influence and strengthen central authority. Ultimately, the success achieved in this campaign led to an increase in loyalty of the Qizilbash commanders to their Shahs and convinced them of his strong leadership. Undoubtedly, this military victory also resulted in political gains for Shah Tahmasp. Therefore, despite the campaign not achieving total victory, Shah Tahmasp had to be content with its outcomes.\n\n\n=== Second march ===\nIn the winter of 1547, six years later, Shah Tahmasp launched a new campaign against the Kingdom of Kartli. Apparently, the decision was influenced by the rebellion of Shah Tahmasp's younger brother, Alqas Mirza, and his participation in the third Ottoman campaign. News of Alqas Mirza's rebellion reached Shah Tahmasp while he was in Qazvin in 1546. The Shah's envoy, Ali Agha Qapichibashi, was sent to persuade him, but his efforts were unsuccessful. Subsequently, Shah Tahmasp decided to march to Shirvan with his army. Upon hearing of the Shah's approach, Alqas Mirza felt threatened and sent his mother and son, Ahmed Mirza, to the Shah's court seeking forgiveness. The Shah accepted the offer and dispatched his senior officials, Shahqulu Khalifeh Mohuradari, Sevindik Bey Qorchubashi, and Badr Khan Ustajlu, to arrange for Alqas Mirza to swear an oath on the Quran that he would not rebel again. In return for his agreement, Alqas Mirza pledged to pay a thousand tumans in tribute annually, send a thousand soldiers in times of war, and remain loyal until death. Despite not being entirely satisfied with these developments, Shah Tahmasp continued his march northward and arrived in Tabriz from Sahand.\nIt turned out that Alqas Mirza's agreement to submit was merely a tactical maneuver to buy time. Shortly after swearing his oath, he reneged on it, minted coins in his own name, and began delivering sermons. This indicated that he was seeking to ascertain whether the Ottoman Sultan would indeed come to his aid. Subsequently, Alqas Mirza traveled to Shamakhi, then to Derbent. After crossing the Samur River, his forces clashed with the Qizilbash forces under the command of Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoghlu Qajar, Muhammad Bey Turkman, Suleyman Bey Chalabi, and Muhammad Bey Shirbext's son Talish, resulting in their defeat. Their next encounter was with the Qizilbash army led by Shahqulu Khalifeh, and again they were defeated. Realizing that he could not defeat the Qizilbash, Alqas Mirza fled the battlefield and sought refuge in Ottoman territories, deciding to seek asylum with Sultan Suleyman.\nSince Alqas Mirza showed the initial signs of submission, the main army of the Qizilbash was stationed in the city of Tabriz and was fully prepared for battle. After Alqas declared his submission and swore to pay taxes and send troops, a decision was made to attack Kaxetiya with the army already in readiness in Tabriz. However, when Shah Tahmasib received news that Alqas Mirza had rebelled again, he was already advancing rapidly towards Georgia, as recorded in his memoirs. Thus, it appears that Shah Tahmasib made the decision to march into Georgia regardless of Alqas's forgiveness, indicating his rebellion once again. Shah Tahmasib reached Agsheher with his army in the winter of 1547. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the defeat of the Georgian forces and the devastation of the region. The army then set off from Agsheher towards Tabdiye, where Levend-bek and his counterpart Bash Achıq expressed their loyalty, reaching the Shah's camp. The Shah received them warmly and bestowed upon them honorary garments. They quickly returned to their estates. Meanwhile, the army continued its march towards Ganja, setting up a temporary camp near Bulaq.\n\n\n=== Third march ===\nThe third march into southern Georgia took place in 1551. The Qizilbash army, commanded by Bedr Khan Ustajlu, Shahqulu Ustajlu, and Shahqulu Khalife Mohrdar, gathered in Sheki with the assistance of Georgian forces under the command of Levant Bey, and defeated its ruler, Dervish Mehmed Khan. As the main part of the army camped in Sheki, one of the Georgian rulers, Keikhosrow, appealed to Tahmasp for help against Luarsab, as Luarsab and Vakhusa Guji had taken over part of his lands. Meanwhile, the Ottoman army, under the command of Iskender Pasha, entered the western region of present-day Georgia. It is very likely that to prevent the Georgian ruler Luarsab from forming an alliance with the Ottoman army, the Qizilbash forces, under the command of Bedr Khan Ustajlu, Ali Sultan Tekeli, and Shahverdi Khan Ziyadoghlu (who played a decisive role in this march), marched towards Luarsab's main fortress located in Kartli. Although they captured Malinkub (also mentioned as Mankub Darfar or Manaskub Darqard in sources), Darzbad, and an unnamed monastery, they could not capture Luarsab's main forces, and they managed to escape and save their lives. The Qizilbash forces looted the captured territories and killed 20 of the clergy in the monastery.\nIn the autumn of 1551, the Qizilbash commanders launched another march into the interior of Kakheti to eliminate Luarsab's main army. However, they could not achieve an absolute victory against Luarsab's small but well-organized army, as Luarsab once again evaded decisive combat. Nevertheless, the Qizilbash obtained significant plunder and captives, raiding the surrounding regions, including Barat Ali.With the onset of winter, the Safavid army withdrew to Karabakh. Safavid sources explicitly state that during these raids, the region was devastated, and a large portion of the local population fell victim to plunder, confirming the extremely harsh nature of this campaign. Hasan Bey Rumlu also provided detailed information about the clashes. Politically, the Safavids achieved several important objectives with this campaign. Shah Tahmasp gained a new vassal ruler like Keikhosrow. Additionally, Keikhosrow assisted Shah Tahmasp in capturing Tumak Castle, Aghsheher, and the surrounding areas. Renowned Georgian nobles Vakhus Guji and his ally, the ruler of the territories held by Keikhosrow, Sharmazanoghlu, were captured and executed, and their lands were divided. However, they could not capture Luarsab, the main rival commander of the Georgian army. Therefore, punitive measures against the local population were implemented by the Qizilbash army.\n\n\n=== Fourth march ===\nDuring the reign of Sultan Suleiman, immediately after the last Ottoman campaign, which covered the years 1553–1554, the Qizilbash army immediately embarked on a new march towards Kartli. Like the previous Ottoman incursions, this Ottoman march resulted in significant losses for both sides without giving either side any advantage. Therefore, peace negotiations commenced immediately after the conclusion of the march, culminating in the Treaty of Amasya in 1555. Writing about these events seventy years later and having the opportunity to evaluate them retrospectively, Iskender Bey Munshi considered the division of the Georgian kingdoms between the Ottomans and Safavids as part of the Treaty of Amasya. According to him, both sides agreed that Samtskhe, Kartli, and Kakheti would remain under Safavid jurisdiction, while the Ottomans would control Basiani, Dadian, and Kuriyana (Imretia, Mingrelia, and Guria).\nMeanwhile, Kartli King I Luarsab utilized the Safavid-Ottoman rivalry once again to assert greater autonomy. In response to the threat posed by the Ottomans, Shah Tahmasp, reinforced by his trusted commander Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoghlu Qajar, invaded Luarsab's territory. Luarsab employed the same battle tactics that Shah Tahmasp had used against the Ottoman army, avoiding direct confrontation. However, the better military strategy of the Qizilbash army enabled them to defeat Luarsab and gradually advance towards his capital. As a result, they captured the city of Qori in 1554. Although the fortresses of Mezrut, Parsatan, and Aydin were captured during the battles, Aydin fortress, which was then the residence of Luarsab's mother, offered stubborn resistance. The most intense battle of this campaign occurred during the siege of Aydin fortress, where many of Luarsab's warriors fiercely resisted the attacks of the Qizilbash. Eventually, breaches were made in the fortress walls, and the defenders' resistance was overcome. The Safavid forces slew many and took numerous prisoners, including Luarsab's mother, as captives. Over the following weeks, they gained significant spoils, wealth, and new slaves, crushing other pockets of resistance in the region. Safavid sources do not mention the fate of the king's mother afterward. According to Safavid chronicles, during this campaign, the Safavid army took more than 30,000 Georgian captives, relocating them to Safavid territory. It is reported that the Qizilbash army spent the winter near Qori and moved to Karabakh in January. In February, the Shah and his army moved southward to Ganja, where the governor, Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoghlu Qajar, hosted feasts and festivities in honor of the successful campaign for eight days. Subsequently, the Shah's army proceeded to the province of Barda.\nIn 1557, after reclaiming Qori, Luarsab gathered an effective army and expelled the Safavid garrison from the region. Upon hearing this news, the Beylerbeyi of Karabakh, Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoghlu, marched to put an end to Luarsab's efforts once and for all. However, his cavalry was ambushed on the way. While the Qizilbash army suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat, one of the commanders in Shahverdi Khan's ranks, Mehmed Bey Chepni, managed to break through Luarsab's ranks and engage him in combat, ultimately killing him. Taking advantage of the chaos, Mehmed Bey Chepni seized Luarsab's horse and escaped from there. The Qizilbash fighter who succeeded in killing Luarsab was subsequently slain by Luarsab's warriors. Luarsab's son, Simon I, succeeded him, continuing the struggle against the Qizilbash.\nFive years later, Simon entered into a military alliance with Levan, the king of Kartli, which was further solidified by Simon's marriage to Levan's daughter, Nestan Darejan. Simon's aim was to gather a large army and recapture Tbilisi from the Safavids. Joining the coalition were Levan's son, Georgi, and many other influential provincial lords. According to a contemporary chronicle, \"in a short time, so many warriors were assembled that the ancient heavens had never seen such a thing in centuries of existence.\"\n\n\n=== Fifth march ===\nShah Tahmasp once again ordered Shahverdi Sultan Ziyadoglu, the ruler of Karabakh, to attack the Georgians and suppress their rebellion. Leading the Karabakh warriors, he marched from Ganja and encountered the Georgian forces on May 1, 1561. The Georgian army, armed with light weapons, was not as swift as the Qizilbash cavalry. Quickly, the Georgians were defeated and fled from the battlefield. The defeated troops of Kartli retreated northward to the city of Qori. Levan's son, Qurgin, along with a thousand warriors, was mercilessly slain. The consequences of this event were recorded in one of Kartli's palace chronicles as follows:\n\nUpon hearing the news of his son's death, Levan's heart was engulfed in flames of sorrow, and tears of blood streamed from his eyes. All the Georgians donned black mourning attire.\nThe defeat in this battle had long-lasting consequences. It shattered hopes of achieving political and military unity under the general banner of Kakheti. Not only did it undermine the aspirations for independence among the Kakhetians, but it also deeply affected the royal family of Kartli on a spiritual level. While Simon continued to stubbornly reject Safavid rule, his brother, XI David, fearing his ongoing civil opposition and the unstable political situation, betrayed him and defected to the Safavid side. In 1561, with the support of his followers, he came to the Safavid court in Qazvin and pledged allegiance to Shah Tahmasp. He embraced Islam and was thereafter recognized as Khan David. Shah Tahmasp acknowledged him as the ruler of Tbilisi and rewarded him with limited authority. According to the accounts of Iskandar Bey Munshi, under the rule of the Safavid Shah, he could rule, and \"from this time onward, he served as one of the commanders of the Tbilisi fortress among the Qizilbash emirs, and worked as an advisor and mentor to Khan David\".\n\n\n=== Sixth march ===\nIn 1566, Simon I attempted to seize Tbilisi from his brother and almost succeeded, crushing a small Safavid garrison under the command of Ibrahim Khalifa Karamanly, who had hastily attacked Simon's forces. It seems that the main reason for this was the Georgian contingent's refusal to obey Dāwūd Khan's order to provide support to the Safavids. However, the citadel of Tbilisi proved impregnable to Simon's forces, and after a few days they lifted the siege and retreated. This small defeat alarmed the Safavid court with Simon's growing power. The following year, Shah Tahmasp I instructed Dāwūd Khan to deal with his defiant brother Simon once and for all. In order to provide the necessary military support, he sent Shamkhal-bek Cherkes, Ibrahim-bek Alpaut and Aligulu-bek Qajar to his aid. In the bloody battle that soon followed, the Safavid army captured Simon on the battlefield and brought him to the court at Qazvin. He was held as a prisoner in the famous fortress of Kahkaha until 1578, when he was equipped and sent back to fight the advancing Ottoman armies.\n\n\n== Result ==\nKartli and Kakheti kingdoms were subjected to continuous incursions for a long time. With the Amasya peace treaty, the recognition by the Ottoman Empire of these territories within the sphere of influence of the Safavid Empire was formalized. The constant raids by Qizilbash bands in the region replaced Georgian kings with their own men, deposing one king and installing another, and frequently taking captives. Additionally, the rugged terrain of Georgia, characterized by dense forests and mountains, hindered the eradication of resistance centers in the region.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

In 1962, Cui won the Hundred Flowers Award for Best Actor as Zhu Laogong in Keep Red Flag Flying (1960).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCui Jingwen was born on 14 October, 1912 into a poor peasant family. He started working at the age of twelve. Cui was able to attend a school in Qingdao due to the help of a relative but was expelled due to his Communist political activities.\nIn 1930, having briefly studied scriptwriting at Shandong Provincial Experimental Theatre, he organized the Seagull Theatrical Troupe and wrote stage play scripts. In 1932, he joined the League of Left-Wing Dramatists and traveled to the east and north of China, performing in leftist activities to promote patriontism against the Japanese invasion.\n\nAfter studying theatre, Cui moved to Shanghai in 1935 and was a part of the leftist theatre movement. He adapted the play Lay Down Your Whip for street performances.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1938, Cui joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and taught at the Lu Xun College of Arts in Yan'an. In 1949, he was appointed as director of the Cultural Bureau of the Central and South China District. He was also elected deputy of the Third National People's Congress, member of the 5th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultive Conference, and the China Federation of Literature and Art Circles.\nIn 1954, Cui made his acting debut as the male lead in The Rebels (1955). In 1955, he quit his job at the CCP to join Beijing Film Studio and starred and multiple other films such as The Spirit of the Sea (1957), New Story of an Old Soldier (1959), and Keep Red Flag Flying (1960). For his performance in the latter, he won Best Actor at the 1st Hundred Flowers Awards.\n\nHe also directed and co-directed films such as Song of Youth (1959), an adaptation from Yang Mo's novel of the same name, Zhang Ga, a Boy Soldier (1963), a children's film, and Women Warriors of the Yang Family (1960), which was an adaptation of a traditional opera.\nIn 1966, Cui was repeatedly subjected to censorship and, in 1968, was imprisoned and sent to reform through labor. He was released in 1972.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCui died on 7 February, 1979, of liver cancer.\n\n\n== References ==",

He reigned between 1804 and 1806, when he was killed in battle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEltuzar was the son of the Inak Ivaz, on whose death he was appointed as his successor. After six months, he deposed the  powerless Khan Abu l-Ghazi Khan III, sent him back to the country of the Kazakhs and told him that he would look for another Khan in his place. Then, he summoned all the notables and told them that he himself would become Khan. Those present consented, and therefore he became the first time Khan of Khiva who did not descend from Genghis Khan.\nEltuzar continued his father's recovery policy: he reformed taxes and strengthened the poll tax system, while developing irrigation. He built new buildings in Khiva. The first year of his reign, he successfully undertook a military expedition against the Yomut Turkmen tribe, who lived in the south of present-day Turkmenistan and in the surroundings of Astrabad.\nIn 1806, Eltuzar Khan launched an unsuccessful campaign against Haydar bin Shahmurad, Emir of Bukhara, which ended in the defeat of his troops. During the retreat, many of his soldiers drowned while crossing the Amu Darya.\nEltuzar himself was able to get into a boat, but when too many of his people tried to board too, the overloaded boat sank and Eltuzar drowned. His brothers Hasan Murad Beg and Jan Murad Beg also died in the battle. Kutlugh Murad Beg was taken prisoner, and only one other brother, Muhammad Rahim, was able to escape and reach Khiva. The famous Chorasmi standard was captured, and numerous distinguished persons were also made prisoners.\nEltuzar was succeeded by his only brother who had returned to Khiva after the battle. He was proclaimed as Mohammed Rahim Khan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHenry Hoyle Howorth. History of the Mongols, from the 9th to the 19th Century. Part II division II.

He represented Canada at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest.\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\n\n\n=== High School ===\nHassan was a standout runner all four years of high school, attending Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in Toronto and competing on the club level for the Phoenix Athletics Association.\n\n\n=== 2017-18 ===\nHis grade 9 year, he placed first at the OFSAA Championships in the 800 m and won the Canadian U16 title later that summer. The following year, he placed first at OFSAAs in both the 400 m and 800 m, and clocked a personal best of 1:51.86 in late July.\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\nCompeting at 2019 New Balance Indoor Nationals in New York City, Hassan took first place in the 800 m in a time of 1:51.91.

He not only qualified for the final, but placed third behind Marco Arop and Brandon McBride. In the process he set a new Canadian U18 record in a time of 1:47.59.\n\n\n=== Wisconsin Badgers ===\nAfter only competing sparsely in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hassan enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, to compete for the Wisconsin Badgers track and field team.\n\n\n=== 2021 ===\nIn his first season of collegiate competition, Hassan qualified for both the NCAA Indoor and Outdoor Championships, but failed to make the final on both occasions. On July 18, competing at the Sound Running Sunset Tour in Mission Viejo, California, Hassan took first, running a personal best of 1:46.16. The mark was just 0.09 seconds off Brandon McBride's Canadian U20 record of 1:46.09, putting Hassan second on the all-time list.\nIn August, Hassan competed in the 800 m at the World Athletics U20 Championships in Nairobi. After advancing through the first round with a mark of 1:49.09 and through the semi-final with a time of 1:46.89, Hassan competed in the final, placing seventh in 1:50.07.\n\n\n=== 2022 ===\nCompeting at the 2022 NCAA Indoor Championships, Hassan contested the DMR alongside Wisconsin teammates Adam Spencer, David Wenthe, and Jackson Sharp.

In June, At the NCAA Outdoor Championships, Hassan once again missed out on the final, placing eighth in his semi-final heat. Later that month, he placed fourth at the Canadian Track and Field Championships, running 1:47.16.\n\n\n=== 2023 ===\nAt the 2023 NCAA Indoor Championships, Hassan once again competed as part of Wisconsin's DMR team, replicating their performance from the year prior as well, placing third. At the NCAA Outdoor Championships, Hassan qualified for his first national final, placing fourth in 1:46.30.\nSelected to represent Canada at the NACAC U23 Championships in San José, Costa Rica taking place in July, he placed fourth in the 800 m final on July 23. Competing as part of Canada's 4 x 400 team he placed fourth and as part of the mixed 4 x 400, he earned a bronze medal. Just a few days later, Hassan competed at the Canadian Championships in Langley, British Columbia, where he placed second in 1:46.93.\nHaving been sufficiently high-enough on the world ranking list, Hassan was selected to represent Canada in the 800 m at the World Championships in Budapest. Making his world championship debut, he finished fifth in his first round heat in 1:46.33, less than two-tenths of a second off of his lifetime best, but not enough to advance to the next round. Following the competition, he noted that he \"he had never been to a competition like this or a stadium this big\" and that fellow Canadian Marco Arop told him to \"take in the moment and experience\".\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\nHassan opened his 2024 season with an indoor 800 m personal best of 1:46.61 to take the win at the Badgers Windy City Invite in Chicago, breaking the Wisconsin school record in the process. At the NCAA Indoor Championships in Boston, he contested just the individual 800 m, qualifying for final and taking eighth place.\n\n\n== Competition record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Trimeresurus mayaae also commonly known as Maya's pit viper is a species of venomous pit viper endemic to north-eastern India.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMales have a deep green dorsum, and fluorescent green ventrum with black interstitial skin. The head is dark green with cyan borders on scales, eyes are rust colored and red-white stripes on the body. Female individuals are similar but with yellowish-green ventrum and green eyes. Both sexes exhibit rusty red tails.\n\n\n== Range ==\nTrimeresurus mayaae occurs throughout the Shillong Plateau and the adjoining Jaintia hills, Barail and Mizo hills. It has also been found in Manipur.\n\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nSpecimens were found during early hours of night in a forested patch next to a stream within Military Cantonment area. An individual was spotted on the ground, crossing a track. In captivity, the specimens fed on the Rhacophorus bipunctatus, Leptobrachium sp. and Minervarya sp.\nAll known records of the species are from elevations greater tha 900m and hence, the low land areas may potentially act as a biogeographic barrier for the new species. The distrubuted areas are isolated from other members of Viridovipera (Subgenus of Trimeresurus), by low elevation human dominated landscape, The Brahmaputra River to its north and the Indo-Burma hills along the international borders of the two countries (India and Myanmar).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific epithet mayaae is derived from the name of one of the species discoverer's late mother, Maya Singh Rathee.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nTrimeresurus mayaae is likely a member of the subgenus Viridovipera as suggested by molecular data. Molecular data also suggests that the species is sister to T. medoensis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The New Republican People's Party (Turkish: Yeni Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi), New CHP (Yeni CHP), or YCHP, is a term used to describe the ideological shift of the Republican People's Party, especially during the tenure of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was the leader of the party from 2010 to 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CHP participated in the 2002 Turkish general elections under the leadership of Deniz Baykal and became one of the two parties that exceeded the 10% threshold with the AKP. The AKP promised to democratize the country, make Turkey a full member of the European Union, adopt a new free market economy, and to achieve full rights for the Kurdish minority. This inspired factions of the CHP to do the same as to counter the AKP. The SHP faction of the Kemalists, which did not agree with much of Deniz Baykal's policies and had a much more liberal policy, formed the basis of the ideological shift. When the CHP performed poorly in the 2004 local elections, 30 CHP deputies, who were disturbed by Deniz Baykal and his management of the CHP, including Muharrem İnce and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, established a movement called \"CHP's March to Power\" and issued a statement. This movement was later called the \"30s Movement\". An electional congress was later held, in which Baykal lost his power and Kılıçdaroğlu was elected in 2010.\nThe CHP, which was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and was famous for its hardline Turkish nationalism, as well as its role in developing Turkish nationalism, began to loosen up on the nationalism under Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. The CHP further liberalised on many other factors, and became much more inclusive, accepting people regardless of religion, language, race, gender, ethnicity, belief and ideology. Kılıçdaroğlu also attempted to appease Kurdish voters. In 2012, Kılıçdaroğlu used the phrase \"Y-CHP\" for the first time when announcing the new management staff. In a statement described as a derogatory reference against Baykal and Sav, Kılıçdaroğlu said \"when we say CHP, we forgot the past, we reject the thought that we established a CHP again. There is no such thought. What we mean by the New CHP is the new management of the CHP. This administration is the administration in favor of the people, this administration is a libertarian administration that resists fears. It is an administration that brings freedom. No one but no one will move us to an area outside of freedom and law.\"\nIn the 2011 elections, deputies with different views on the Kurdish issue, headscarf issue, and economic issue were elected into the CHP, further diversifying it. Although Kılıçdaroğlu emphasised for more reform, secularism remained a main policy of the CHP, while the Turkish ethnic nationalism shifted into a leftist civic nationalism.\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu made a speech in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on November 16, 2021. He promised reforms, and the speech had unofficially become one of the symbols of the New CHP.\nAfter the loss of the 2023 Turkish presidential, Özgür Özel and a few party leaders, including Ekrem İmamoğlu, started a movement against the perceived authoritarianism of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, and ended his tenure, electing Özel in late 2023.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nKılıçdaroğlu's reforms were met with opposition mainly from hardline Kemalists, who emphasized on nationalism and secularism, and were concerned that the principles of Atatürk were not being respected, and  were also worried that the CHP was becoming tolerant of Kurdish separatists.\nThe reforms of the CHP had also been criticized by various nationalist, ulusalist, and idealist factions. Many politicians of the CHP left the party as well. The CHP was also accused of drifting too far away from Atatürk's ideology and being unrecognisable compared to the original CHP.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Knuth–Plass algorithm is a line-breaking algorithm designed for use in Donald Knuth's typesetting program TeX. It integrates the problems of text justification and hyphenation into a single algorithm by using a discrete dynamic programming method to minimize a loss function that attempts to quantify the aesthetic qualities desired in the finished output.\nThe algorithm works by dividing the text into a stream of three kinds of objects: boxes, which are non-resizable chunks of content, glue, which are flexible, resizeable elements, and penalties, which represent places where breaking is undesirable (or, if negative, desirable). The loss function, known as \"badness\", is defined in terms of the deformation of the glue elements, and any extra penalties incurred through line breaking.\nMaking hyphenation decisions follows naturally from the algorithm, but the choice of possible hyphenation points within words, and optionally their preference weighting, must be performed first, and that information inserted into the text stream in advance. Knuth and Plass' original algorithm does not include page breaking, but may be modified to interface with a pagination algorithm, such as the algorithm designed by Plass in his PhD thesis.\nTypically, the cost function for this technique should be modified so that it does not count the space left on the final line of a paragraph; this modification allows a paragraph to end in the middle of a line without penalty. The same technique can also be extended to take into account other factors such as the number of lines or costs for hyphenating long words. \n\n\n== Computational complexity ==\nA naive brute-force exhaustive search for the minimum badness by trying every possible combination of breakpoints would take an impractical  \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}\n  \n time.

The hills where both parks are located separate Malaysia's Parliament building and Perdana Botanical Gardens from the downtown area around Dataran Merdeka. Taman Tugu is the property of Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional. It was once the residential area for British colonial officers, and later, Malaysian government officers. By partnering with the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM), over a thousand trees in Taman Tugu have been marked for preservation. More trees, including indigenous species, are being planted on-site within nurseries to eventually be moved into the main forest area.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1930s, the Taman Tugu site, which used to be a plain grass-land, was home to some British government officers. Many of these British residents fried their hand at planting in their backyard. A popular species experimented with was palm oil trees which were brought from West Africa as ornamental plants. After independence, the site was used by Malaysian government officers. Many of the residents left the site towards the late 1970s.\n\n\n== References ==",

His three sons, William Wallace, Hugh Allan and Andrew Alexander, also became landscape gardeners and they together created many of Cardiff's most notable parks, including Bute Park, Cathays Park, Llandaff and Pontcanna Fields, and Roath Park. The Glamorgan Archives, which holds the records of Cardiff County Borough Council containing materials relating to the development of the city's parks, describes them collectively as \"the family who landscaped Cardiff\".\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nPettigrew was born in Ayrshire, Scotland in 1833. In 1866 he was engaged by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, beginning a collaboration that lasted until Bute's death in 1900. Pettigrew began working at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, before transferring to the Bute estate in South Wales in 1873. In 1865 Bute had met the architect William Burges and the pair began a partnership which transformed Cardiff Castle, Bute's base in the city, into \"the skyline of the capital of Wales. The dream of one great patron and one great architect [became] the symbol of a whole nation\". Pettigrew was closely involved with this work, laying out Bute Park which became the private park of the castle. Cadw, in its listing record for the park, describes Pettigrew as \"one of the most important park designers of the second half of the nineteenth century\".\nIn an innovatory step, Bute determined to introduce commercial grape vines at Castell Coch in 1873. He sent Pettigrew to France to study vineyards there and together they planted a 1.2-hectare (3-acre) vineyard below the castle.  By 1887, the output was 3,000 bottles of sweet white wine of reasonable quality.\nPettigrew also undertook work at Sophia Gardens, at Roath Park, and on Pontcanna Fields and at Cathays Park, then both part of the castle's private grounds. In these two spaces, he planted wide avenues of lime and elm trees, which survive. His son, Andrew Alexander, wrote of Bute's last visit to Cardiff, shortly before his death in 1900 when the Cathays site had just been sold to Cardiff Corporation for development as the city's civic centre. Walking in the park with Pettigrew, Bute commented on the avenues of trees; \"There, Pettigrew, there’s something that will stand as our monument, yours and mine for many generations after we have departed”. Pettigrew is also commemorated at the West Lodge, the southern entrance to Bute Park designed by Alexander Roos, where the cafe is named the Pettigrew Tea Rooms in his honour. Another modern tribute is contained in the People's Door entrance to the park. Created in 2011 by the architect Michael Davies, the door includes nine panels featuring people, events and structures related to the area. Pettigrew is celebrated by a portrait in the panel in the top-right corner. Another panel depicts the demolished Swiss Bridge. The Glamorgan Archives, holders of the records of Cardiff County Borough Council which has materials relating to the development of the city's parks, describes Pettigrew and his sons as \"the family who landscaped Cardiff\".\n\n\n== Sons ==\n\n\n=== William Wallace Pettigrew (1867–1947) ===\nAndrew's eldest son, William Wallace, was born at Dumfries House in 1867. He trained under his father and at Kew Gardens. He became the head gardener to Cardiff Corporation in 1891 and became the city's first superintendent of parks on Cardiff's incorporation in 1905. During this time he worked on Roath Park, Llandaff and Pontcanna Fields, and was closely involved with the city's chief engineer, William Harpur in the development of Cathays Park, as the city's civic centre. He was succeeded in this role by his brother, Andrew Alexander, when he took up the post of Chief Parks Officer at Manchester in 1915. While at Manchester, he undertook an important study on the impact of air pollution on city-centre parks, focussing on Philips Park, located in the most-polluted part of the city. He returned to the role on Andrew's premature death in 1932. During his retirement he wrote an influential book on the management of public spaces, Municipal parks: layout, management and administration, together with a short treatise on the organisation of a public parks department, which he dedicated to Andrew Alexander. On his second retirement, he returned to Worthing on the Sussex coast, where he died in 1947.\n\n\n=== Hugh Allan Pettigrew (1871–1947) ===\nTrained, like his brothers, under his father and at Kew Gardens, Hugh became head gardener to Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth at Hewell Grange, Worcestershire in 1897. He subsequently transferred to the earl's South Wales estate, St Fagans Castle when he remained until his retirement in 1935. His later years were marred by alcoholism and his retirement was prompted by a dispute with the earl. He moved to Nice dying in 1947, following a collision with a police car.\n\n\n=== Andrew Alexander Pettigrew (1875–1936) ===\nThe youngest son, Andrew Alexander trained with his father, during which time he travelled to China and Japan to study horticulture and flora, and at Kew. He worked with his brother Hugh at St Fagans, before succeeding to the post of head gardener to Lord Plymouth at Hewell Grange, where he remained from 1900 to 1915. He then returned to Cardiff to take up the Chief Parks Officer role vacated by his eldest brother William and continued in this post until his death from cancer in 1936. During his tenure, he wrote a seven-volume study, The Public Parks and Recreation Grounds of Cardiff. The work was never published, but is held in the Cardiff City archives and is an important source on the history of Cardiff's parks.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCrook, J.

        "content": "Nicholas Robin (1697? – 13 May 1775) was a Welsh physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRobin was, a native of Wales. He was born about 1697, graduated M.D. at Rheims on 15 Dec. 1718, and, like Richard Mead, who was his first patron, began practice without the necessary license of the College of Physicians, residing in Wood Street in the city of London. In 1721 he published ‘A Compleat Treatise of the Gravel and Stone,’ in which he condemns the guarded opinion which Charles Bernard had given on the subject of cutting into the kidney to remove renal calculus, and declares himself strongly in favour of the operation. He describes a tinctura lithontriptica, pulvis lithontripticus, and elixir lithontripticum devised by him as sovereign remedies for the stone and the gravel. In 1725 he published ‘A New Theory of Physick and Diseases founded on the Newtonian Philosophy.’ The theory is indefinite, and seems little more than that there is no infallible authority in medicine. In 1727 he published ‘A New Method of treating Consumptions,’ and on 27 March was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians. He moved to Warwick Court in Warwick Lane, and in 1729 published ‘A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack Melancholy,’ dedicated to Sir Hans Sloane. He mentions in it, from the report of eye-witnesses, the last symptoms of Marlborough's illness, which are generally known from Johnson's poetical allusion to them, and relates as example of the occasional danger of the disease then known as vapours that a Mrs. Davis died of joy because her son returned safely from India; while a Mrs. Chiswell died of sorrow because her son went to Turkey. In 1729 he published a ‘Discourse on the Nature and Cause of Sudden Deaths,’ in which he maintains that some cases of apoplexy ought not to be treated by bleeding, and describes from his own observation the cerebral appearances in opium poisoning. His ‘Treatise of the Venereal Disease,’ which appeared in 1736, and ‘Essay on Gout,’ published in 1755, are without any original observations. He used to give lectures on medicine at his house, and published a syllabus. He also wrote ‘The Christian Philosopher’ in 1741, and ‘A Treatise on the Virtues of a Crust of Bread’ in 1756. All his writings are diffuse, and contain scarcely an observation of permanent value. He died on 13 May 1775.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Blackadder, William\".

        "content": "Marcus Artorius Asclepiades was physician of ancient Rome of the Artoria gens who was one of the followers of Asclepiades of Bithynia, and afterwards became the physician of the Roman emperor Augustus. The historian Plutarch even describes Artorius and Augustus has having been friends (philoi). He was said in some sources to have had several other very notable patients such as Mark Antony, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Cicero.\nArtorius attended Augustus -- then simply known as Octavian -- in the latter's campaign against Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus in 42 BCE, and several ancient writers tell an anecdote of Artorius saving Octavian's life during it, including Augustus himself, in his memoirs.\nThe story is that at the Battle of Philippi, while Octavian was stricken with sickness in his tent, Artorius was said to have had a dream of the goddess Athena, who commanded him to get Octavian, despite his sickness, to the front lines with his men (or, alternatively, simply to flee to a nearby marsh). Octavian followed this advice, saving his life, as shortly thereafter the forces of Brutus and Cassius broke through to the camp and ransacked Octavian's tent, expecting to find him there.\nWe next hear of Artorius eleven years later, having drowned in a shipwreck in the aftermath of the Battle of Actium, in 31 BCE.\nWe otherwise know little about his life. Historically he was said to have come from Smyrna, but the inscription on which this assertion was based is believed by modern scholars to have been fake.\nThe 2nd-century theologian and philosopher Clement of Alexandria quotes a work by a person of the same name, On Great Excellence (περὶ Μακροξιοτίας), which may or may not be the same person.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Greenhill, William Alexander (1870). \"M.

Ani had been left unprotected, as the Georgian court was spending Easter at the Palace of Geguti. Ani was thoroughly plundered and a population of 12,000 was allegedly massacred on this Eastern Sunday of 1209.In retaliation, Zakare raided Ardabil on Ramadan. In 2010, Zakare launched a vast campaign against Persia, passing Nakhchivan, and going on to plunder the cities of Julfa, Marand, Tabriz, Meyaneh, Zanjan, Qazvin, and as far as Gorgan. Altogether, it was a journey of about 3,000 kilometers, before going back to the Georgian capital of Tbilissi.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBaumer, Christoph (5 October 2023).

It is chosen by the jury from the films in main competition at the festival. It is considered the third most prestigious prize after the Golden Bear and the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe prize was introduced to replace the Alfred Bauer Prize, which was suspended in 2020 after it was revealed that its namesake Alfred Bauer, the founding director of the festival, had been an active high-ranking Nazi closely involved in a propaganda organisation set up by Joseph Goebbels. In its place, the international jury presented the \"Silver Bear – 70th Berlinale\" at the 2020 Festival. The new Silver Bear Jury Prize was first presented at the 2021 Festival, where Maria Speth was its inaugural winner.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBerlinale website",

        "content": "Caroline Laura Relton is a British biochemist, Professor and Pro Director for Research and Academic Development at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her research considers genetic and epigenetic epidemiology and looks to understand the role of DNA methylation in complex disease.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRelton studied applied biology and nutritional science as an undergraduate. She earned a postgraduate certificate in science education in 1990. She was a doctoral research student in molecular genetics at Newcastle University. Her research involved investigations into genes associated with insulin resistance. After completing her doctorate she was appointed to the faculty at Newcastle, a position she held for 12 years.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nShe moved to the University of Bristol in 2012. Relton investigates the variations in epidemiology that cause disease, and how these can be used to predict disease. She uses population-based approaches to study how behavioural, psychological, and social variables relate to DNA methylation. She was one of the first researchers to show that DNA could be a predictor of body weight: factors that influence the development of a baby in the womb (e.g. diet, smoking, stress) can predispose a child to obesity. Relton studied this using the Children of the 90s study. She used data from 520,000 people across Europe to demonstrate a link between levels of B vitamins and lung cancer, showing a reduced risk of lung cancer among people with high levels of Vitamin B6 and methionine.\nAlongside her research position at Bristol, Relton is Pro-Director of Research and Development at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nGibran Hemani; Jie Zheng; Benjamin Elsworth; et al.

Stimpy reads the book The Littlest Giant about a giant cat played by himself who mocked as the smallest giant. After crying his eyes out over his rejection by his fellow giants, Stimpy leaves the land of giants and finds a struggling farmer Wee Ren whom he assists in various ways.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was the last in a short lived series called Stimpy's Storybook Land. The illustrator Jim Smith  drew background scenes based on the work of N. C. Wyeth that gave the story \"an appropriate storybook look and feel\". The team who worked on The LIttlest Giant have panned the writing on the episode with Bob Camp calling it an episode where \"you have to wait for them to say what's going to happen before it happens\". The director, John Kricfalusi, had his name removed from the credits in order to disallow his own work.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe journalist Thad Komorowksi wrote that The Littlest Giant was one of the worse episodes in the first season that was \"a run-of-the-mill Saturday morning cartoon\"..}\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "content": "Rahti or Cargo, is a Finnish television crime drama series, which was broadcast on Yle TV1 from 3 September 2021. Its eight episodes are based on an idea by Matti Kinnunen, who is also the director and a scriptwriter. Fellow writers are Veikko Aaltonen and Johanna Hartikainen. Filming began in 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scenes were shot in Finland, Italy and Malta. Rahti was nominated for Nordisk Film & TV Fond Prize for best screenplay of a Nordic drama series.\nThe main protagonist, Kiki (Evelyn Rasmussen Osazuwa), is an Eritrean refugee, who is fleeing local soldiers. On her journey to Finland, where her father Sammy (Alain Azerot) lives, she is separated from her husband Aman (Geoffrey Erista) and daughter Liah (Ariela Francis). In Finland, Riku (Johannes Holopainen) steals Sammy's van without knowing it has a refugee family hidden inside.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKiki is discovered harbouring her deserter sister-in-law by authorities. Kiki and her family flee Eritrea. They head towards Finland, where Kiki's father Sammy lives. Sammy's van is stolen by scrap yard dealer Riku. Sammy hid Syrian refugees Bushra, Jawad and Rayan inside. Riku and his brother Joni house the refugee family. Kiki is separated from her husband Aman and daughter Liah as they leave Africa. Kiki travels across the Mediterraean Sea to Italy and thence to Germany. Sammy tracks down Riku and hires him to collect Kiki. Sammy is arrested for people smuggling. Human traffickers led by Sharif transport Aman, Liah and other refugees towards Finland. Riku brings Kiki to Finland. Aman drowns and Liah is taken by Sharif's associates Jorge and Yonah. Yonah is Sammy's nephew but he tells his girlfriend Barbara to take Liah to Sweden where she is sold online as \"Lilly\". Riku leaves seriously ill Rayan at a health centre, where they determine he requires a kidney transplant. Refugee lawyer Maria becomes Rayan's legal guardain. Bushra's brother Kamal approaches Sharif for money to fund Bushra. Sharif requires Kamal to take in unregistered refugees as boarders.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nSources:\n\nEvelyn Rasmussen Osazuwa as Kiki Selam: former Eritrean army staff sergeant, café owner; becomes a refugee\nJohannes Holopainen as Riku Railo: scrap yard owner, car thief\nAlain Azerot as Sammy: Kiki's father, Finnish resident, people smuggler\nOona Airola as Maria Korpi-Heikkilä: Refugee Protection lawyer\nAmos Brotherus as Joni: Riku's younger brother, student\nYasmin Ahsanullah as Bushra Hanano: Syrian refugee, mother, held by Riku\nBoodi Kabbani as Jawad Saleh: Bushra's husband, refugee, held by Riku\nJalal Hajali as Kamal Hanano: Bushra's brother, Maria's interpreter\nOna Huczkowski as Sarah: Aman's sister, army deserter, killed by soldier\nGeoffrey Erista as Aman: Kiki's husband, dies by drowning\nAriela Francis as Liah / \"Lilly\": Kiki's four-year-old daughter, sold as Lilly by traffickers\nRufaro Rwambiwa as Yonah: Sharif's henchman, Kiki's cousin, killed by Jorge\nTommi Rantamäki as Petteri: Maria's husband\nJanette Hirvonen as Jenna: Joni's love interest\nRobin Kawa as Jorge: Sharif's henchman\nDavid Kozma as Sharif: human trafficking crime lord\nLadwn Shakarchi as Rama Saleh: Bushra's daughter\nLuka Pajuhi as Rayan Saleh: Bushra's son, left by Riku at health centre,\nEmilia Neuvonen as Barbara: Yonah's girlfriend, works for Sharif\nDavid Leguesse as Samir\n\n\n== Reception ==\nVariety's John Hopewell described Cargo as \"compelling, edge-of-the-seat series charting the desperate plight of illegal immigrants, in line with other taut social issue thrillers\". Leena Reikko of Kulttuuritoimitus observed that Rahti, whilst well-made, did not address vital issues about human trafficking: \"Some [criminals] move these people, some direct the cargoes that carry them. Who? They are not the guys who, in ports, shove those who have bought their voyages into unseaworthy vessels. Nor are the cargoes controlled by a long chain of petty criminals who get their own crumbs from this tray. However, someone is controlling this, and some are profiting from it.\"\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRahti at IMDb",

        "content": "Thomas Short (1635 – 28 September 1685) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShort son of the Rev. William Short. He was born at Easton, Suffolk, in 1635. He was sent to the grammar school of Bury St. Edmunds, and thence to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a sizar on 25 February 1649–50, aged 14 (Mayor, Admissions, i. 94). He graduated B.A. in 1653, and was created M.D. by royal mandate on 26 June 1668. He settled in London and was admitted a candidate at the College of Physicians in December 1668, but was not elected a fellow till 26 July 1675. He had joined the church of Rome, and, in accordance with an order of the House of Lords for the ejection of Roman Catholics, was summoned to attend a meeting of the College of Physicians on 14 April 1679. He did so, but the feeling of the college was against intolerant proceedings; a quorum was not present, and no steps were taken. He attained considerable practice, and Thomas Sydenham, who had met him in consultation, found his ‘genius disposed for the practice of physick’ (Works, ed. Pechey, 1729, p. 339), and praises both his learning and sagacity. Sydenham prefixed to ‘A Treatise of the Gout and Dropsy’ a letter to Short in which occurs a famous passage on posthumous fame which Fielding quoted in ‘Tom Jones.’ Short died on 28 September 1685, and is buried in St. James's Chapel, London. Bishop Burnet, who thought that Charles II died of poison, also believed that Short was poisoned by his co-religionists for asserting that the king was poisoned (Own Time, i. 609). Richard Lower and Walter Needham seem to have been unable to resist an opportunity of imposing upon the whig historian's credulity.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1897). \"Short, Thomas (1635-1685)\".

        "content": "Begin Again: Live Tour (stylized as Tohoshinki Live Tour 2017 ～Begin Again～), also known as the Begin Again Tour, was the ninth Japanese concert tour by South Korean pop duo Tohoshinki. Consisting of 20 shows across Japan, the tour commenced on November 11, 2017, at the Sapporo Dome in Sapporo, Hokkaido Prefecture and concluded on June 10, 2018, at the Nissan Stadium in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. It was the highest-grossing and most-attended concert tour in Japan that year, mobilizing over 1.28 million concertgoers and grossing over US$110 million in ticket sales alone.\nThe Begin Again Tour was the duo's first concert tour after their discharges from the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, which they served from 2015 to 2017. It was first announced on August 21, 2017, three days after Changmin's discharge. The tour was the duo's third nationwide five-dome tour, and supported their compilation album Fine Collection: Begin Again (2017).\nThe tour broke numerous records. With over 1.28 million attendees, the Begin Again Tour was the highest-grossing and most-attended concert tour ever held by a foreign artist in Japan, a title that Tohoshinki had held previously with their Time Tour in 2013. Tohoshinki were the first foreign artist in Japan to perform at the Nissan Stadium for three consecutive days, and also the first foreign artist to host two different concert series at the stadium. It was the highest-grossing concert tour in Japan in 2017.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFrom July 2015 to August 2017, Tohoshinki went on a hiatus to fulfill their compulsory military service for South Korea. During their hiatus, the members released solo mini albums U Know Y (2015) by Yunho, and Close to You (2015) by Changmin, both limited exclusive releases for their fanclub, Bigeast. On April 2, 2016, their tenth anniversary concert films Till (2016) and Till 2 (2017) were released at select theaters and venues, running from April to November 2016, and the sequel running from March to April 2017. Their first remix album as a duo, Two of Us, was released in October 2016.\nOn August 21, 2017, three days after Changmin's military discharge, the duo held a press conference to announce their return to music. Then, they announced they will first return to Japan with a Japanese compilation album Fine Collection: Begin Again in October 2017, which comprised all of their singles since they came back as a duo in 2011, as well as a few remixes of older songs. The Begin Again Tour, which accompanied the compilation album, opened at the Sapporo Dome on November 11, 2017. There, they debuted their first performance of their comeback Japanese single \"Reboot,\" which was released in December 2017.\nInitially announcing fourteen shows, three more shows were added for Osaka due to demand. The seventeen shows amassed over 780,000 people. Selling out all shows, Avex announced in January 2018 that the tour's final three days would be held at the Nissan Stadium in Yokohama, making Tohoshinki the first foreign artist in Japan to perform at the stadium for three consecutive days. The stadium shows alone grossed over US$50 million in ticket sales and merchandise, bringing the total concert tour gross to over US$110 million, making the Begin Again Tour Tohoshinki's best-selling concert tour to-date.\n\n\n== Set list ==\nThis set list was taken from the November 11, 2017, concert in Sapporo. It does not represent all shows throughout the tour.\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\n\n\n== Video release ==\nTohoshinki Live Tour 2017 ～Begin Again～ is a live DVD and Blu-ray concert film by South Korean pop duo Tohoshinki, released on March 28, 2018 through Avex Trax in Japan. The DVD was filmed during the duo's ninth Japanese concert tour Begin Again, which ran from November 17 to January 2018. The tour was Tohoshinki's third nation-wide dome tour in Japan, performing at five domes across six cities, with the Nissan Stadium as its final stop. The DVD debuted at number one on the Oricon chart, charting for thirty-two weeks. Titled Tohoshinki Live Tour ～Begin Again～ Special Edition in Nissan Stadium, the Nissan Stadium recording was released as a separate DVD and Blu-ray release on December 19, 2018. It also debuted at number one on the Oricon, and charted for thirteen weeks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBegin Again DVD Special Website (in Japanese)",

        "content": "V. Rajagopalacharlu (1830-1868) was an Indian lawyer, jurist, and Hindu religious reformer, who was one of the first Indians in the colonial epoch to achieve wealth and renown in the courts of British India, accomplishing both alongside his brother, V. Sadagopacharlu, in the judicial system of the Madras Presidency, in which they were leading Vakils. He also was an advocate of religious reform within Hinduism, as the primary exponent of the Brahmo Samaj movement in South India. \n\n\n== Career ==\nThe brothers practiced before the appellate Sudder Court and its cassation court, the Supreme Court, operated in civil matters by the British East India Company under the aegis and authority of the Mughal emperors, and administering customary law in both Hindu and Muslim varieties, as selected and interpreted by learned Brahmin Pandits and Ulema known as Maulvis respectively, and decided by British judicial officers they instructed accordingly, referring in the former case to Dharmaśāstric canons pursuant to the commentary and supercommentary of Jīmūtavāhana's Dāyabhāga Nyāyika school of law, observed in Bengal, and Vijñāneśvara's Mitākṣarā Mīmāṃsāka school of law, which prevailed everywhere else. The latter took as authoritative Hanafi jurisprudence. Legal advocacy of Vakils and Barristers, and the same bodies of law, were preserved in the succeeding High Court of Madras after the 1857 Indian rebellion resulted in Parliament's supersession and dissolution of the Company, with it enacting the Indian High Courts Act 1861 and Queen Victoria accordingly creating the new High Court the following year. Both brothers, members of the Vembaukum family, which had first risen to prominence in the early nineteenth century with the dubash, grain merchant, and shipowner V. Krishna Aiyar, were associated with zamindari litigation, including that of the 2,351-square-mile Estate of Ramnad, a mediatized former kingdom with more than half a million tenants and almost 800,000 rupees in revenues. In the courts, Ramnad secured the transmitting of its succession by adoption, frustrating application of the Doctrine of Lapse, with Sadagopacharlu earning 150,000 rupees through the process, at a time when the typical remuneration for a High Court lawyer involved in a case was 10,000 rupees. Of the two, Rajagopalacharlu was reported to be \"even more brilliant\" than his brother, and was noted as an authority on and occasional composer of Carnatic music, and as a skilled hypnotist, photographer and marksman. \nHe had two sons, who followed him and their uncle into law, apprenticing with their celebrated cousin Sir V. Bhashyam Aiyangar: Sir V. C. Desikachariar, father to lawyer and legal historian V. C Gopalratnam, and V. C. Seshachariar, founder and editor of the legal publication Law Weekly, which is still published by the Vembaukum family.  One of the most storied of the Vembaukum family mansions in Mylapore, within the city of Madras, was Vasantha Vilas (\"Abode of Spring\"), which he built to supply agricultural laborers with work during a time of extreme drought, the Great Famine of 1876–1878, under a relief scheme enacted by the Presidency. His widow and sons relocated to the mansion after Rajagopacharlu's death in 1878 at the age of thirty-eight, reportedly from despair, three months after accidentally shooting and killing his brother-in-law as the two of them hunted near Vembakkam lake. Certain of his creditors mistakenly pursued the Brahmo Samaj for his debts, believing it to be the recipient of personal funds invested by him, which caused some trouble for the organization. Sadagopacharlu had also died young, earlier in the decade, at thirty-five, in 1863.   \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sandora Society was a charitable, cultural, and educational society active in Lithuania Minor (mainly the Klaipėda Region) from 1904 to 1940. Its long-term chairman and leader was Lutheran priest Vilius Gaigalaitis. Based in Klaipėda (Memel), it supported Prussian Lithuanian activities as a counterweight to Germanization efforts. The society supported religious education for the youth, provided charitable aid to the elderly (including opening a modern care home in 1935 which continues to this day), organized church choirs, published monthly Pagalba as well as religious and educational books. It had a rich library which had about 7,000 books by 1937. Sandora and its institutions were closed after the German takeover of Klaipėda Region in 1939. The society was reestablished by Lutheran priests in 1989–1995.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe society was initiated by Kristupas Lokys, a Lutheran missionary in India. It was established in February 1904 to promote Christian values and teetotalism. In August 1905, priest and activist Vilius Gaigalaitis was elected chairman. He remained the driving force of the society until 1939. Gaigalaitis was so vital and central to Sandora that researcher Domas Kaunas characterized the society as a personal endeavor of Gaigalaitis. \nThe society diminished during World War I, but did not cease its activities. It grew after the Klaipėda Region became an autonomous region of Lithuania. In 1934, the society had assets of 68,000 Lithuanian litas and had revenue of 177,866 litas. Its main revenue was donations from Lithuanian-speaking villagers. After 1923, it also received support from the Lithuanian government. Despite its religious character, Sandora was not supported by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lithuania.\nAfter the region was taken over by Nazi Germany in March 1939, society's activities were restricted and it was closed in 1940.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Education and charity ===\nSandora supported religious education for the youth. It established Sunday schools and published books for adolescents. It encouraged students to pursue higher education and provided financial aid. A few times, the society organized its own courses (for example, courses for homemakers in 1908 and for nurses in 1932). Sandora supported the establishment of  the first Lithuanian gymnasium in Memel (now Klaipėda Vytautas Magnus Gymnasium) in 1922 and the Faculty of the Evangelical Theology at Vytautas Magnus University in 1925. \nIn 1908, the society opened its house in Klaipėda which hosted a bookstore, soup kitchen, and space for meetings and events. It was located next to the Church of St. Jacob. In 1918, the house also hosted a dormitory for students. In 1933, Gaigalaitis built a new personal residence. The first floor had two large halls used by Sandora for various events. He lived on the second floor. \nDuring World War I, Sandora raised funds in Germany and United States for the Prussians deported to Siberia.\nSandora established and maintained homes for the elderly and the disabled in Plikiai (1926) and Tauragė Manor (1928). In 1935, the two homes for the elderly were consolidated and moved to the newly constructed modern premises in Laugaliai (now part of Gargždai) that could accommodate about a hundred residents. The home continues to operate to this day is now named after Vilius Gagalaitis.\n\n\n=== Related societies ===\nSandora organized local chapters in each parish. It organized various local meetings, festivals, lectures and had church choirs.\nSandora's sections for women and youth became separate organizations in 1924 and 1928, respectively. \nThe women's organization Moterų pagalba (Women's Help) established two kindergartens and Sunday schools. The organization provided aid to struggling families by purchasing women's crafts (for example, knitted gloves or woven tablecloth) and selling them to the public. Starting in June 1935, they organized an annual flower festival and used the proceeds for charitable purposes. The women also organized other events like the commemoration of the Mother's Day.\nThe youth organization Jaunųjų Sandora primarily concerned with religious education and organizing religious celebrations. In 1937, the youth organization had 14 chapters with 380 members, 10 church choirs, five wind and four string ensembles. It also published a calendar and had a radio program. \n\n\n=== Publications and library ===\nSandora published its monthly Lithuanian newspaper Pagalba (1904–1938) edited by Gaigalaitis. It was distributed to society's members for free. Pagalba published mainly religious and educational texts. Sandora also published 23 books, including five textbooks for primary schools. Other books were mainly on religious topics. \nIn 1910, Sandora started selling books and other publications. Initially, it sold books at the Klaipėda city market, but quickly established more permanent bookstores in Priekulė (1913) and Klaipėda (1914) but they were closed during World War I. Sandora reestablished its bookstore in 1928. In addition to books, it sold women's handcrafts and office supplies. Additional bookstores were opened in Pagėgiai (1934) and Šilutė (1938).\nThe society had a rich library as its chairman Gaigalaitis merged his personal book collection with the society's library. Initially, the library attempted to collect all Lithuanian publications. Therefore, it included some old and rare Lithuanian publications, such as Postil of Jonas Bretkūnas (1591), hymnal by Daniel Klein (1704), dictionary by Philipp Ruhig (1747). The library focused on Lithuanian and Lutheran publications. By 1937, it had 6,937 books. According to library's handwritten catalog, it had about 3,850 books and 185 periodicals in Lithuanian, 3,020 books and 66 periodicals in German, and a handful of publications in English and French. The library was dispersed during World War II. Some 1,600 books were transferred to the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania in 1997, but the fate of the oldest and rarest books is unknown.\nIn addition to books, the society also collected ethnographic items and Lithuanian folk art. It showcased some of these items at folk art exhibitions in Berlin, Königsberg, Gumbinnen, Klaipėda.\n\n\n== Reestablishment ==\nAs Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the society was reestablished by Lutheran priests in Klaipėda, Šilutė, Priekulė, Pagėgiai in 1989–1995. In 1996, it opened its premises in Klaipėda (Turgaus g. 35) that hosted a charitable pharmacy, soup kitchen, and various events and meetings. The society aimed to provide aid to the elderly, disabled, single mothers, recently released from prisons, and others. It received support from various German organizations. In 2012, the Šilutė chapter provided aid to 23 children and about 115 elderly. The Klaipėda chapter ceased operations in 2024 due to financial difficulties. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Boy Who Cried Rat! is the 6th episode of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show.  It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 8, 1991.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are homeless, broke and hungry again. After being chased away by George Liquor after attempting to eat discarded food from his garbage bin, Ren devises the scheme where he will pose as a rat while Stimpy will use his feline abilities as a cat to pose as a rat-killer. Ren sneaks into the house of the perpetually clueless couple, Mr. and Mrs. Pipe, who are upset to see an apparent rat in their house. The Pipes hire Stimpy to kill Ren, which he avoids doing as part of the scheme. Finally, Stimpy is forced by the Pipes to try to kill Ren, who is forced to reveal the scheme to save his life. Ren is unable to pay back the money that Stimpy had collected as Stimpy has eaten the money.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMrs. Pipe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\nGeorge Liquor-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was ordered in October 1990 for a premiere scheduled for the fall of 1991. The showrunner, John Kricfalusi, was heavily involved in supervising the illustrations for The Boy Who Cried Rat!. The process of making the drawings scene by scene in order to create the illusion of movement was done at the Carbunkle studio in Vancouver with much of the work being done by the husband-and-wife team of Bob Jaques and Kelly Armstrong. The episode marked the second appearance of Kricfalusi's George Liquor character, an oafish opinionated lout based on Kricfalusi's own father despite the reservations by the Nickelodeon network about the character. The producer of the show, Vanessa Coffey, strongly disliked the Liquor character whom she did not favor at all.. Kricfalusi stated about the opposition of female network executives to the Liquor character: \"It's purely that a bunch of politically correct women see George Liquor-the ultimate caricatured right wing character-and they hate him\"..\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe journalist Thad Komorowski gave The Boy Who Cried Rat! three stars, writing the episode was full of \"sheer joy and pure anarchy\".\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "content": "John Scott (1798 – 11 April 1846) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nScott was only son of James Scott, a general practitioner of medicine, living at Bromley in Kent. His father acquired a large practice, and was particularly successful in the treatment of chronic ulcers and of diseased joints. John Scott was educated first at a private school in Sevenoaks, and afterwards at the Charterhouse. He was then apprenticed to Sir William Blizard, the senior surgeon to the London Hospital in Whitechapel. He was admitted a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries on 29 April 1819, and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 June 1820.\nHe practised with his father at Bromley for a short time, but after marrying he came to London, and was living in New Broad Street in 1824. On 24 November 1826 he was elected surgeon to the Ophthalmic Hospital in Moorfields in succession to [Sir] William Lawrence. Scott was elected assistant surgeon to the London Hospital on 18 July 1827. He was appointed full surgeon on 28 March 1831, resigning on 3 Dec. 1845. He died at Brighton, after a prolonged illness, on 11 April 1846.\nScott revolutionised one department of surgery by introducing the passive treatment of diseased joints. His method, however, was distasteful to his contemporaries owing to the unnecessary complications with which he surrounded it; but stripped of these, his principle remained a potent factor in surgery. He treated chronic ulcers by the method his father had taught him of strapping the leg from the toes upwards, and he was thus opposed to Thomas Baynton's method, which consisted in applying the strapping for only a short distance above the ulcer. Scott's dressing and Scott's ointment became known to every student of surgery, though they are now rarely used. His dressing had, as its base, a camphorated mercurial compound. Constant practice is said to have rendered him the most skilful bandager in London, at a time when bandaging in the London hospitals was almost a fine art.\nScott was distinguished as a surgeon by the rapidity and by the general accuracy of his diagnosis. He displayed great decision and energy in the treatment of his patients. He was a bold, but not particularly brilliant operator, and he is said to have been the first surgeon in England to remove the upper jaw. He was of an uncertain and irritable temper, which disease sometimes rendered overbearing.\nHis works are: \n\n‘Surgical Observations on … Chronic Inflammations … particularly in Diseases of the Joints,’ 8vo, London, 1828; a new edit. by W. H. Smith, London, 8vo, 1857: a most valuable work, for it lays down very clearly the necessity for putting at rest diseased joints.\n‘Cases of Tic-douloureux and other Forms of Neuralgia,’ 8vo, London, 1834.\n‘Cataract and its Treatment,’ 8vo, London, 1843: the object of this work was to introduce a sickle-shaped knife, but the instrument never came into general use.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1897). \"Scott, John (1798-1846)\".

The project and its operations are not fully declassified, but there are documents that show it was running at least from 2018 to 2021.\nThe NCA through its operation said in 2020 that it was monitoring some 70 dark web sites that were accessible, and by working with partners, the NCA had identified a significant number of unique global IP addresses visiting the dark web sites.  With 5 percent of the IP addresses originating from users in the UK.In 2019 the NCA, working in partnership with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), availed their resources via Operation Habitance to the Brazilian Federal Police as part of their Operation Lobos 1, and to the German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) in a Tor deanonymization project as a dragnet of the administrators and users of the websites: Baby-Heart, Hurt-meh, Boyvids 4.0, Anjos Prohibidos (BR)/Forbidden-Angels, and Loli Lust, Girland and other websites.  During the time the Tor Onion services were active, starting in early March 2019, the NCA and their partners conducted traffic analysis under the Targeted Equipment Interference (TEI) warrants 91-TEI-0147-2019 and 91-TEI-0146-2019\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe NCA says that through its programmes, it had been making on average 520 arrests each month as of 2020, and that it had \"safeguarded\" 700 children each month.\n\n\n== Secrecy ==\nIn 2020, the U.K. HMICFRS's confirmed the existence of Operation Habitance in a report, but the next year, a U.K FOIA commissioner in Wales affirmed the Gwent Police department's refusal under FOIA section 25(3) (see report)  to even confirm the existence of the operation or their involvement.  The U.S. FBI FOIA has not been much better, as of 2022 the U.S. has acknowledged receipt of information from the NCA regarding allegations generated by Project Habitance, but has redacted all relevant information on the few records they have released.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of U.S. cases",

        "content": "The York Dialectic Union, previously known as the York Union, is a debating society at the University of York. It was founded in 2013, refounded in 2023, and is affiliated with the University of York Students' Union. It hosts high-profile speakers and debates, as well as more sociable pub crawls. The Union has been described as \"similar to the Oxford and Cambridge Union without all the bells and whistles.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Union grew out of Nouse Events, affiliated to Nouse, which was founded by Adam Seldon and Harry Lambert in 2012. Until then, debates and talks had received a poor turnout from students, so it was believed that a distinct organisation to publicize and host events. This proved to be so successful that in 2013 the York Union was founded as an independent society. Seldon was interviewed by the Guardian about his experiences in founding a university society, and the lessons he learnt while forming the Union. Events were sometimes held in co-operation with university departments.\nThe Union fell victim to COVID-19, when attendance and popularity of events dropped, with the last event being held in 2022. However, the idea of the Union proved to still be a popular one, so in Autumn Term 2023 it was refounded by Findlay Milne, Adam Moses, Josef Bräutigam, Cameron Bennett, and Henry Howard. They gave a variety of reasons for deciding to refound the society, including to \"have two more days a week with a reason to have a drink\", to \"have another reason to why I'm failing my degree\", and \"to prove to my parents I don't avoid their calls for no reason\". The Union were able to secure Jeremy Corybn to support on side in a debate about wealth tax in December 2023. The event was hosted in the Piazza Building's lecture theatre, with tickets selling out within days of sales opening.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe society is organised and run by a committee elected by members. The committee consists of:\n\nPresident - Adam Moses\nSecretary - Cameron Bennett\nTreasurer - Josef Braeutigam\nReturning Officer - Henry Howard\nStrategist - Findlay Milne\nEquity Officer - Jessica Griffiths\n\n\n== See also ==\nCambridge Union\nOxford Union\nDurham Union\nParliamentary style debate\n\n\n== References ==",

Lyrically, the rappers detail how they stay true to their backgrounds as gangsters regardless of their fame and success.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBillboard considered the song an \"instant standout\" from Texas Technician and stated, \"Equal parts menacing and funny, 'Twisting Fingers' is a stellar balancing act.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

On 30 November 1701 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and he was admitted on 3 Dec. He read one paper before the society, an ‘Account of an Extraordinary Skeleton’ (Philosophical Transactions, 1741, xli. 820). He was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Anne on 9 November 1709, and on 9 February 1712 was sworn one of the physicians in ordinary, in the room of Dr. Martin Lister being succeeded in his former office by Dr. Hans Sloane. The accounts of the queen's illness in December 1713–14 in Abel Boyer's ‘History of the Reign of Queen Anne’ are derived from Shadwell's letters to the Duke and Duchess of Shrewsbury. Boyer recorded Shadwell's opinion that the queen died of ‘gouty humour translating itself upon the brain.’ He continued to be physician in ordinary to George I and George II, and was knighted on 12 June 1715. He long resided in Windmill Street, and in 1735 withdrew from practice and retired to France, where he remained until 1740. He died at Windmill Street on 4 January 1747. He was buried on 8 January at Bath Abbey, where there is a tomb with an elaborate epitaph to his memory.\nSir John Shadwell was twice married; by his first wife, who died on 14 April 1722, he had issued one son and three daughters. He married, secondly, Ann Binns, at Somerset House chapel, on 12 March 1725; and on 29 June 1731 he made his will in her favour. Lady Shadwell survived until 1777.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1897). \"Shadwell, John\".

        "content": "Dejan Ristić (Serbian Cyrillic: Дејан Ристић; born 20 April 1972) is a Serbian historian, administrator, and politician. He is acting director of Belgrade's Genocide Victims' Museum and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024 as an independent delegate endorsed by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\n\n\n== Early life and academic career ==\nRistić was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy and has attended specialized education in Jerusalem and London on Holocaust research and public administration. His academic focus includes diplomatic history (including Serbia's relations with the United Kingdom and France), the Holocaust, the culture of memory, and the state's relationship with traditional religious communities in the twentieth century. He has published widely in these fields.\nHe has initiated and coordinated several projects under the auspices of UNESCO, co-authored national installations including \"Military memorials and places of suffering from the Second World War\" (2011), and attended professional and academic conferences in several countries. His book, House of Unburnable Words: National Library of Serbia 1938-1941 (2016) inspired the documentary film, Memories from the Ashes. He has translated several works, including Jan Keršo's Hitler – Hubris: 1889–1936 and Hitler – Nemesis: 1936–1945.\n\n\n== Administrator ==\nRistić began working in Serbia's ministry of labour in November 2003; he was responsible for the protection of war memorials, places of suffering, and the culture of remembrance. He was appointed as acting director of the National Library of Serbia in January 2012 and served in this role until September 2013.\nRumours circulated in 2013 that Ristić would be appointed as Serbia's minister of culture, though ultimately Ivan Tasovac received the role instead. Ristić served as a state secretary in the ministry in 2013–14. He opened an exhibition on the Non-Aligned Movement at Belgrade's Museum of Yugoslavia in June 2014, describing the movement's ideals as \"still important and justified.\"\nHe applied for director of the National Library in 2019 but was not included on the shortlist of candidates on the technical grounds that he \"did not prove that he has at least ten years of work experience in culture, of which at least four years in leadership positions in a cultural institution.\" He submitted an objection to this decision.\nIn 2021, Ristić served on a committee that organized a cultural and artistic program for Victory Day, commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The program included verses from two songs associated with Dimitrije Ljotić's fascist movement in Serbia. Ristić defended this decision on the grounds that their author had no connection to Ljotić's movement and that the works deserved to be reclaimed from historical misuse. Others criticized their inclusion.\nThe Serbian government appointed Ristić as director of Belgrade's Genocide Victims' Museum on 12 May 2021. In August of the same year, he sent a public letter to the Jerusalem Post newspaper condemning a recent article by David Goldman, whom Ristić accused of having minimized the number of victims at the Independent State of Croatia's Jasenovac concentration camp in World War II.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nRistić appeared in the third position on the Serbian Progressive Party's Serbia Must Not Stop electoral list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election as a non-party candidate. This was tantamount to election, and he was indeed elected when the list won a majority victory with 129 out of 250 seats. He took his seat when the assembly convened in February 2024 and is now a member of the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; a deputy member of the committee on education, science, technological development, and the information society; a deputy member of the European integration committee; and a deputy member of the committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues.\nHe has again been discussed as a candidate for minister of culture.\n\n\n== Books ==\nZaštita spomen-obeležja iz ratnih perioda (English: Protection of wartime memorials) (2003) co-author\nMemorijali oslobodilačkih ratova Srbije: Pregled spomen-obeležjau zemlji i inostranstvu (English: Memorials of the liberation wars of Serbia : Overview of memorials in the country and abroad), Volume 2 (2005) co-author\nUsud Karađorđeve Srbije: Priča o srpskim Termopilima: bitka na Čegru 1809 (English: The Fate of Karađorđe's Serbia: The Story of Serbian Thermopylae: The Battle of Čegar 1809) (2009)\nSećajte se mene moji jer me više nema (English: Remember me, my friends, because I'm gone) (2011) co-author\nKuća nesagorivih reči: Narodna biblioteka Srbije 1838-1941 (English: House of Unburnable Words: National Library of Serbia 1838-1941) (2016, rev. 2019)\nIstorija srpske diplomatije: dokumenti: Srpsko poslanstvo u Londonu 1882-1902 (English: History of Serbian diplomacy: documents: Serbian Embassy in London 1882-1902), Volume 1 to 3 (2018/21) co-author\nIstorija srpske diplomatije: dokumenti: Srpsko poslanstvo u Parizu 1881-1902 (English: History of Serbian diplomacy: documents: Serbian Embassy in Paris 1881-1902) (2018/21) co-author\nMitovi srpske istorije (English: Myths of Serbian History) (2019)\nZablude srpske istorije (English: Errors of Serbian History) (2020)\nLegende svetske istorije (English: Legends of World History) (2020)\nSećanja iz pepela : Narodna biblioteka Srbije 1941-2021 (English: Memories from the ashes: National Library of Serbia 1941-2021) (2021)\n\n\n== References ==",

Previously, Columbia has historically voted for Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden for U.S. president by nearly 40 points. Its two previous mayors, Bob Coble and Steve Benjamin were Democrats.  Some Republicans, including Ben Shapiro and United States Senator Rick Scott of Florida, cited Rickenmann's win as part of a \"red wave.\"\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== 2025 ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMayoral elections in Charleston, South Carolina\nElections in South Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Platysace effusa is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a tuberous, perennial herb or shrub with linear leaves and white flowers in a compound umbel.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPlatysace effusa is a tuberous, perennial herb or shrub that typically grows to a height of 10–75 cm (3.9–29.5 in) and has wand-like branches. Its leaves are linear to wedge-shaped, usually 4–8.7 mm (0.16–0.34 in) long and often crowded. White flowers are borne in compound umbels with 4 to 8 rays on thin peduncles longer than the leaves, each ray with a partial umbel. Flowering occurs in most months and the fruit is flat and about 2 mm (0.079 in) long and notched at the base.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1849 by Nikolai Turczaninow who gave it the name Trachymene effusa in the journal Bulletin de la Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou from specimens collected by James Drummond. In 1939, Cecil Norman transferred the species to Platysace as P. effusa in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The specific epithet (effusa) means \"spread out\" or \"straggling\" referring to the habit of the plant.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of platysace grows on sandplains, sand dunes and hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee bioregions of south-western Western Australia and is listed as \"not threatened\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Shaw (2 April 1792 – 19 July 1827) was a Scottish surgeon and anatomist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShaw was born 2 April 1792, was the son of Charles Shaw, clerk of the county of Ayr, and brother of Alexander Shaw, of Sir Charles Shaw, and of Patrick Shaw. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to be a pupil of Charles (afterwards Sir Charles Bell, who became his brother-in-law. The connection thus formed lasted until Shaw's death. At the Great Windmill Street school he acted as superintendent of the dissecting-room, and on the death of Wilson became co-lecturer with Bell. The greater part of the experiments which led to Bell's discoveries on the nervous system were performed by Shaw, and he also took a large share in the work of forming Bell's anatomical museum. Bell's ‘Letters’ show in what affectionate regard he held him. Shaw accompanied Bell to Brussels immediately after Waterloo to study the effect of gunshot wounds. In 1821 he went to Paris to explain to the profession there Bell's methods of investigating the functions of the nervous system. In 1825 he was by a large majority elected surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital. This office he held until his death from fever on 19 July 1827. Bell wrote to his friend John Richardson on 21 July 1827: ‘I have lost my dear and best friend, John Shaw. He was the happiest creature in his death, laughing to see my exertions to relieve him.’\nShaw accomplished much good work during a short life. His principal works are:\n‘A Manual of Anatomy,’ 1821; 2nd edit. 1822; 3rd edit. 2 vols. 1822. This book was republished in America, and was also translated into German; it was mainly intended for medical students, and was founded on the demonstrations given by Shaw at Great Windmill Street.\n‘On the Effects on the Human Countenance of Paralysis of the Facial Nerves,’ 1822.\n‘On the Nature and Treatment of the Distortions to which the Spine and the Bones of the Chest are subject,’ 1823–4. This is illustrated by a fine series of plates, mostly engraved by Thomas Landseer; it is a book of considerable merit, and is quoted at the present day as an authority on orthopædic surgery. In 1825 a supplement was issued, with the title ‘Further Observations on the Lateral or Serpentine Curvature of the Spine.’ Both the book itself and the supplement were translated into German.\nShaw also edited the third edition of Bell's ‘Diseases of the Urethra.’ In the preface Bell pays a high tribute to Shaw's abilities as an anatomist.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bailey, John Bum (1897). \"Shaw, John (1792-1827)\".

        "content": "El Granito Springs was a natural spring in the vicinity of present-day La Mesa in eastern San Diego County, California, United States. The springs were named for their location in a granite outcropping near the San Diego River. \n\n\n== Description and history ==\nDuring the Spanish–Mexican area of California history, a settler used the spring water for curing olives. The spring was first commercialized around 1876. In the early 20th century El Granito water was bottled and marketed to the public. \nAccording to a U.S. government geologist in 1915, \"El Granito Spring is at the base of the granitic slopes at the southern\nborder of El Cajon Valley, 16 miles by railroad northeast of San Diego. The water issues in a small tunnel in decomposed granite at the side of a ravine and is piped about 50 yards to a bottling house. It has been on the local market for several years as a table water. [Chemical] analysis indicates that the water is primary saline and secondary alkaline in character and also has notable primary alkalinity.\"\nThe construction of Avocado Boulevard disrupted the hydrology of the springs and they ceased to flow in the 1970s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nn.a.

        "content": "Plantago raoulii (also known as kopakopa or tūkōrehu in te reo Māori) is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to New Zealand. Joseph Decaisne described P. raoulii in 1852. Plants of this species of plantain are perennial with a rosette habit, leaves widest above the middle, usually 5 seeds in a specific arrangement in each capsule, and bracts with mostly glabrous edges. It is listed as Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPlantago raoulii Decne. is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. French botanist Joseph Decaisne described P. raoulii in 1852. It is known in te reo Māori as kopakopa or tūkōrehu.\nThe type material was collected by Édouard Fiacre Louison Raoul on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand in 1843. The holotype and an isotype are housed at the Paris Herbarium.\n\nPlantago raoulii is morphologically most similar to P. spathulata, P. picta and P. udicola.\nP. raoulii can be distinguished from these and other New Zealand Plantago species by having usually 5 seeds in a certain arrangement inside the capsule. Four of the seeds are vertically oriented, and of these, one pair is short and the other pair is long. The fifth seed is horizontally oriented and in a special compartment above the two shorter seeds.\nP. raoulii can be further distinguished from P. udicola by the bract hairs (glabrous or few hairs hairs on apex only vs. sparsely ciliate), shorter calyx (1.6–2.4 mm vs 2.3–3.5 mm) and smaller corolla lobes (0.6–1.2 mm long by 0.3–0.7 mm wide vs.1.2–2.9 mm long by 0.6–1.3 mm wide).\nIt can be distinguished from P. spathulata and P. picta by sepal margins (glabrous or with a few hairs at apex only vs. sparsely ciliate), bract apex (obtuse or acute vs. acute) and scape hair type.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPlantago raoulii plants are small rosettes with a primary root up to 17 mm thick, with up to 21 usually narrowly angular-obovate, angular-obovate, linear or narrowly rhombic leaves, and with visible, short (<11 mm long), rust-coloured leaf axillary hairs in the basal rosette. The leaves have 1–3 (or sometimes 5) veins, are 21–270 mm long (including petiole) and up to 27 mm wide, not punctate, usually sparsely hairy on the upper surface, and usually sparely or densely hairy on the lower surface. The leaf usually has an acute apex, and its edges are smooth or wavy or with up to 14 minute to medium-sized teeth, and usually sparsely hairy near the teeth. The petiole is usually distinguishable from the leaf lamina, and up to 167 mm long. Each rosette plant has up to 20 erect inflorescences which can be up to 386 mm long. The scapes are smooth and sparsely to densely hairy. The spikes are usually linear-ovoid with 5–32 densely crowded flowers. Each flower has 1 small bract that is ovate, broadly ovate or very broadly ovate and glabrous except for isolated hairs near the apex and sometimes on the midrib. The calyx is 1.5–2.4 mm long, 1.1–2.7 mm wide, with isolated hairs at the apex, otherwise glabrous. The corolla tube is 1.3–2.2 mm long, corolla lobes 0.6–1.2 mm long, stamen filaments 0.7–2.5 mm long, anthers 0.5–1.0 mm long, and style 1.1–3.6 mm long and densely hairy. The ovary is 0.8–2.0 mm long, with 4–6 ovules. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule with circumsessile dehiscence, ellipsoid, broadly ellipsoid, rhomboid, broadly rhomboid, ovoid or angular-ovoid, widest at or below middle, 1.8–4.3 mm long and 1.1–2.7 mm wide. Each capsule has 4–6 rust, brown or dark brown seeds 0.6–2.2 mm long and 0.4–1.0 mm wide, of two or three size classes, ellipsoid or broadly ellipsoid and rounded(2–4 seeds) or rhomboid, angular-ovoid or broadly angular-ovoid and angular (top seed and sometimes 2 others).\nPlantago raoulii flowers from November to March and fruits from about September to May.\nThe chromosome number of Plantago raoulii is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nPlantago raoulii is a plantain that is endemic to the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It is widespread throughout New Zealand and can be locally common.\nIn the North Island P. raoulii is found in the Northland, Auckland (including Inner and Outer Gulf Islands), Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne, Taranaki and Southern North Island regions. In the South Island it is found in the Western Nelson, Sounds Nelson, Marlborough, Westland, Canterbury, Fiordland, Otago, Southland and Fiordland regions.\nIt is also found on several other islands of the New Zealand archipelago including Manawatāwhi Three Kings Islands, Rakiura Stewart Island and Rēkohu Chatham Islands (including Rēkohu Chatham Island, Rangiaotea Pitt Island and Hokorereoro South East Island).\nP. raoulii grows in herbfields, turf, grasslands and forest on rocky, coastal, dry or wet areas, on multiple substrates such as limestone, mudstone, clay, sand, gravel or silt, from 0–1280 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nIn phylogenetic analyses of Australasian species of Plantago using standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA, chloroplast DNA, and mitochondrial DNA regions) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), Plantago raoulii was moderately to strongly supported as being closely related to the mainland New Zealand species P. spathulata, P. picta  and P. udicola.\nSimilarly, the sole individual of P. raoulii was closely related to individuals of P. udicola, P. spathulata and P. picta in another phylogenetic study focusing on Plantago species throughout the world using whole chloroplast genomes. Finally, the species was not included in another phylogenetic studies focusing on oceanic island Plantago species using standard DNA sequencing markers.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nPlantago raoulii is listed as Not Threatened in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Plantago raoulii at Wikimedia Commons\nPlantago raoulii occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "William Schaw (1714?–1757) was a Scottish physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSchaw born in Scotland about 1714, was educated at Edinburgh, and graduated M.D. there, 27 June 1735, reading a thesis on diseases due to mental emotion. He was a friend of Jonathan Swift's physician, Dr. William Cockburn, to whom he dedicated ‘A Dissertation on the Stone in the Bladder,’ which was published during the discussions in the House of Commons on granting money for the purchase of a solvent for stone in the bladder. A second edition appeared in 1739. The dissertation states the method of formation of such stones, the qualities which a solvent must have, and shows that the proposed solvents probably do not possess these qualities. He became a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, 23 March 1752, and was created M.D. at Cambridge by royal mandate in 1753. He was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians, 8 April 1754. His only other work was ‘A Scheme of Lectures on the Animal Œconomy,’ also published in London in 1739. He died in 1757.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1897). \"Schaw, William (1714?-1757)\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "Daniella Carter (born 10 June 1994) is an American activist. She came to prominence as an advocate of transgender rights and a speaker on the issue of youth homelessness. Her work often centres around her personal life story.\nAt 18 months old, Carter was placed in a foster home in New York City, where she experienced various types of abuse. At the age of 14, Carter came out as transgender to her foster parents. Upon their rejection of her identity, she fled her home and became homeless. She turned to survival sex work while continuing to attend high school.\nIn 2014, she was one of 7 transgender youths to share their stories in the documentary film The T Word, produced and hosted by Laverne Cox. After the film, she started engaging in public speaking at events such as TED Talks. In 2023, Carter came to further prominence as one of four Black transgender sex workers featured in D. Smith's documentary film Kokomo City, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received critical acclaim.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCarter was born on 10 June 1994. At 18 months old, she was placed in an upscale foster home in the Queens borough of New York City and raised by conservative Pentecostal Christian parents. Carter says she experienced physical, emotional and sexual abuse while in foster care.In kindergarten, Carter started wanting to present as female. At 14 years old, she came out as transgender to her foster mother. Because of her identity, her parents cut her off. She became homeless, living in the New York City Subway system while continuing to attend Martin Luther King Jr. High School daily. In order to meet her needs, Carter resorted to survival sex work for much of her adolescence. She received some support from high school faculty members, who did not know she was homeless.Carter started transitioning while in high school. Because she had no money for a wig, she wrapped T-shirts around her head. She was rejected and bullied by her peers; once, after being physically attacked, Carter called her foster mother to ask to return home, but she refused. In her first year of college, Carter was abducted, raped and robbed along with a schoolmate. She says that hospital staff asked her if she was \"sure it wasn't sex work\" after they learned that she was trans and couldn't use a rape kit. Following the incident, she applied and was enrolled in a Bailey House housing program.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCarter came to prominence as one of seven transgender youths featured in Laverne Cox's 2014 documentary The T Word. In the Emmy award-winning film, she recounts the story of her rape and subsequent hospital treatment. Following The T Word, Carter started engaging in public speaking at events such as TED and TEDx Talks, where she told her life story. In 2017, she became a youth ambassador for the Human Rights Campaign. In 2020, she launched Daniella's Guestbook, an online platform aiming to spotlight emerging artists.Carter came to further prominence in 2023 with her role in D. Smith's documentary Kokomo City. The film follows four Black trans women — Koko Da Doll, Liyah Mitchell, Dominique Silver, and Carter — \nas they recount their stories and reflexions on sex work. Kokomo City held its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won two awards, and was later screened at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an audience award. It received critical acclaim. A Dazed review praised Carter's \"wise and memorable monologues\" and described her speech on the inherent danger of sex work as a \"standout scene\".In 2023, Carter was also part of the committee that worked to classify the House of Xtravaganza, an emblematic location of the New York City ballroom scene, as a historical landmark.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCarter was married at 21 years old. The couple later divorced.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is situated 17 miles (27 km) northeast of Denali, the highest summit in North America. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's slopes drains to the McKinley River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,160 feet (960 meters) above the Brooks Glacier in 0.75 mile (1.2 km). The mountain's descriptive name was applied in 1948 by Bradford Washburn because the peak is composed of extremely rugged, jagged rock that has been highly fractured by frost action. The toponym was officially adopted in 1948 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Ragged Peak is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. This climate supports the Brooks and Muldrow Glaciers surrounding the peak. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing Ragged Peak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains and mountain ranges of Denali National Park and Preserve\nGeology of Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Ragged Peak\nNational Park Service site: Denali National Park & Preserve",

        "content": "Valhalla Hills is a 2015 video game developed by Funatics Software and published by Daedalic Entertainment. The game is a city-building and strategy game in which players control a tribe of Vikings to build and maintain a settlement with the objective of reaching a portal atop a mountain to enter Valhalla. Upon release, Valhalla Hills received mixed to average reviews, with critics praising the visual design and presentation of the game and pace, but critiquing the implementation of its gameplay mechanics and replayability. Following release, Funatics developed two pieces of downloadable content, Fire Mountains and Sand of the Damned, introducing locations and enemies, and compiled them in a Definitive Edition published in 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n \nPlayers manage a settlement inhabited by Viking villagers that autonomously collect resources and fight enemies. The player controls the settlement by selecting and constructing buildings and is required to balance the needs of the settlement to acquire and sustain raw materials and food, and addressing enemies by either building military structures requiring weapons from mined materials, or building temples to pacify the enemy with their own building requirements. The game features a 'Campaign' mode in which new buildings, upgrades and systems are incrementally introduced, and an 'Open' mode where all features are available from the start of the game, as well as the presence of more difficult enemies.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nValhalla Hills was developed by Funatics Software, a German studio whose CEO Thomas Häuser had previously been involved creating The Settlers II and proceeded to form Funatics in 1998 to create the Cultures series of real-time city building games. The developers stated they set out to create Valhalla Hills to make a \"classical building game\" similar to the Cultures titles, with the game developed by a team of nine from January 2015 and built in Unreal Engine 4. Funatics released the game for early access in August 2015, and in October provided an update that introduced an 'Open Game' mode, providing the player with all features unlocked at a higher level of difficulty. Valhalla Hills exited Early Access for full release in December 2015, with additional game modes and bugfixes. A Definitive Edition of Valhalla Hills was released on 28 February 2017, combining the content from the Sand of the Damned and Fire Mountains DLC.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Valhalla Hills received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics. Evaluating the early access version, Alexander Bohn-Elias of Eurogamer considered the game to not be bad and ideal for quick play, praising the \"wonderfully lit and charmingly populated mountain islands\", but felt the game lacked longevity or replayability in its current state. Marsh Davies of Rock Paper Shotgun, also appraising the early access version, found potential in the underlying systems and described the pace of the game to be \"pretty and peaceful\", but critiqued the lack of \"significant player agency\", the \"obscure\" interpretation of villager behaviours and the effects of player actions. Mark Steighner of Hardcore Gamer commended the \"charming presentation\" and \"relatively complex and robust\" gameplay systems, but noted its lack of features, including a story-driven campaign, multiplayer or map editors, limited its \"breadth of content\". Stefan Weiß of PC Games considered the game to feature a \"charmingly implemented setting\" with \"loving details\" reminiscent of classic city-building games, but felt the game had \"plenty of room for improvement\", noting the \"unnecessarily tricky micromanagement\", the \"fiddly logistics and transport system\", and a lack of long-term goals or scenarios. Hannah Douglass of GamePlanet described the game as \"charming\" and \"addictive\", finding it \"immensely satisfying\" when systems work, but stating the game \"lacks compelling problem-solving scenarios, is too repetitive, and has players relying too much trial and error to progress\". Jose Rodriguez of IGN Spain, reviewing the console Definitive Edition, described the game as \"a technical, fun game with a lot to explore\", found the expansions added a \"lot of use\" to the gameplay and encouraged \"deeper exploration\", also highlighting the \"friendly and pleasant designs\" that maintained the appeal of the PC version.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1859 Georgia gubernatorial election was held on October 3, 1859, in order to elect the Governor of Georgia. Democratic nominee and incumbent Governor Joseph E. Brown defeated Opposition Party nominee and former Cherokee Superior Court judge Warren Akin Sr.\nBy 1859, the Know-Nothings no longer appealed to Georgian voters with its old principles and no one was willing to carry its banner into another gubernatorial election. To do so, according to the Savannah Republican, would be nothing but to \"stand alone, dreaming of the past.\" The battle must be \"with the realities of the present.\"\nThe executive committee of the Georgia Know-Nothings formally announced the demise of the party in early June 1859, with an Opposition party quickly rising from its ashes. This new party issued a call for all Democrats who wished to assert their independence, old Whigs, and former Know-Nothings to assemble.\nThe party was unable to make a nomination at its convention in Macon on July 20 as there were no acceptable candidates. The convention then met again in Atlanta on August 10, with an estimated 1,000 attendees from a conglomeration of those who were politically unhappy. The Federal Union referred to the coming assembly as a \"menagerie of oppossums, coons, and wild cats\" plus \"many other animals.\" Later the same editor labeled the Opposition as \"odds and ends of all parties that have existed in Georgia for the past six years.\"\nThe pro-Opposition Macon Citizen offered a list of thirty-nine possible candidates it could support. The editor proposed balloting until all were eliminated but the strongest. Finding no man of prominence willing to make the race for governor, the Atlanta convention nominated Warren Akin of Cass County, a part-time attorney for the railroad until Brown fired him. In accepting the nomination, Akin, like Brown, explained that poor health would prevent him from carrying on an active canvass. Despite his ill health, Akin did campaign in the principal cities, but all he could do was denounce the Brown administration in general as they had nothing to really offer besides being anti-Banker. All Brown's friends needed to do was point to the achievements of his administration.\n\n\n== General election ==\nOn election day, October 3, 1859, Democratic nominee Joseph E. Brown won the election by a large margin of 21,954 votes against Opposition Party nominee Warren Akin Sr., thereby continuing Democratic control over the office of Governor.\nBrown carried Floyd, Cass, and Fulton counties, the home territory of the discontents, and even Baldwin County, in which the then capital Milledgeville was located, which was last carried by a Democrat in the 1841 gubernatorial election. Brown was sworn in for his second of four terms on November 4, 1859.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a Court official of the Kingdom of Georgia, holding the offices of Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief) for Queen Tamar of Georgia during the late 12th century. He was also ruler of feudal lands in the Kingdom of Georgia. He had two particularly famous sons: Ivane I Zakarian and Zakare II Zakarian. \nSargis rose to prominence at the Georgian court in 1177, when he supported George III of Georgia during a revolt of his feudal lords. \nHe was Commander-in-Chief of the Georgian army (Amirspasalar) from 1185, and he died in 1187 by the Georgian Queen Tamar. His son Zakare II Zakarian would inherit the title a few years later, from 1191.\n\nSargis appears in various inscriptions of the time, such as the dedicatory inscription for the repair of the Church of St. Amenaprkitch in Sanahin Monastery and the construction of a gavit adjoining it, by Abbot Yovhannēs in 1181: \n\nIn the year 630 (ie 1181 CE), at the time of the victorious king Georg, and amirspasalar Sargis and his sons Zak‘arē and Iwanē, and amira K‘urd, I, Yovannēs, Abbot of the holy monastery (re)built this once existing church and a gawit‘ from its foundations, with the help of amir K‘urd and the great vardapet Grigor and Christ God, with great hope...\n\n\n== Family ==\nHis wife was named Saakdukht Artsruni, of the House of Artsunids, their childrens were:\n\nZakare II, Court official of the Kingdom of Georgia holding the office of Amirspasalar (Commander-in-Chief):\nIvane I, Court official of the Kingdom of Georgia holding the offices of Msakhurtukhutsesi (Majordomo) and Atabeg (Governor General);\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1995 Gold Coast City Council election was held on 11 March 1995 to elect a mayor and 14 councillors to the City of Gold Coast, a local government area (LGA) of Queensland, Australia.\nThe election was one of three held in 1995 following several amalgamations, which included the Shire of Albert being absorbed into Gold Coast City.\nRay Stevens, the outgoing mayor of Albert, won the mayoral election, defeating incumbent Gold Coast mayor Gary Baildon as well as five other candidates.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAlbert, created in 1948, had seen a rapid expansion from the late 1960s onwards. However, the Shire of Logan was separately incorporated in 1978, and Albert lost 110.0 km2 (42.5 sq mi) of its area and 54,650 people in the change − almost three-quarters of its population. With the astronomic growth levels experienced by the Gold Coast area from the late 1970s onwards, the new Albert grew from 18,753 at the 1976 census to 143,697 in 1991.\nAlthough the commission's recommendations only included boundary adjustments between Albert and the City of Gold Coast, the outcome following much public debate was a decision by the Queensland Government to absorb Albert into Gold Coast City.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bruce Dorfman (born 1936) is an American mixed media artist and teacher whose work combines painting and assemblage. Dorfman has exhibited extensively in the United States and abroad, and has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 1964.\nDorfman was born in New York City in 1936. His father was a painter and his mother was a pianist. Dorfman recalls drawing and painting in a supportive environment from the age of five, and attended the Art Students League of New York, where he studied with Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Arnold Blanch and Charles Alston. \"The principal instructors,\" he said, \"were highly influential, and I was very close to them.” Later, Dorfman attended the University of Iowa, and graduated with a bachelor’s in social psychology in 1958.\nDorfman has had more than fifty solo exhibitions. He has received a Fulbright Fellowship, as well as awards and grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation; U.S. Department of State; Rockefeller Foundation; New York State Council on the Arts; New York World’s Fair Invitational; Butler Institute of American Art; and the National Academy of Design.\nDorfman may take up to two months to complete an artwork, using paint, canvas, fabric, wood, metal and paper. He explains the process as alternating between activity and contemplation. “There is a lot of physical work that goes into it, and there is also a lot of sitting down and looking at it and knowing when to go for a walk or get a cup of coffee.”\nIn addition to the Art Students League, Dorfman has taught at Syracuse University, the Everson Museum and the New School, and was Artist-in-Residence at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, as well as at museums and art schools in France, Venezuela and Portugal. Among Dorfman's best-known students have been Ai Weiwei and Bob Dylan. In the 1960s, Dylan and Dorfman were neighbors in Woodstock, New York, and Dylan often visited Dorfman in his studio for painting lessons. \"He was very, very attentive,\" said Dorfman, \"wonderfully attentive and absorbing it all very carefully.\" They playfully discussed creating \"a giant flying art object that could materialize over cities, changing shape and color,\" and exchanged gifts of books and musical instruments.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography, Bruce Dorfman website",

The set is less preformed and well known than its minor key counterpart (Douze études dans tous les tons mineurs, opus 39) but contains a few notable woks such as the Allegro barbaro in F major (no. 5),  L'incendie au village voisin in E-flat major (no. 7), and Chant d'amour - Chant de mort in Gb major (no. 10).\n\n\n== Set Composition ==\nThe Opus 35 études are divided into two sets of six which Alexander Eddie notes that the first set serves as a technical exercises for the more advanced second set.  \n\n\n== Recordings of the Complete Set ==\nA complete recording of the set has been made by pianist Mark Viner on his album Etudes Dans Tous les Tons Majeurs Op.35.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stephen M. Waugh (born June 16, 1964) is an American politician who was a member of the Maryland Senate representing District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties from 2015 to 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWaugh was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 16, 1964. He graduated from the Marine Military Academy before attending the United States Naval Academy, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering in 1986. After graduating, Waugh served in the United States Marine Corps, serving as an AV-8B pilot, aviation safety officer, and forward air controller, and attaining the rank of chief of combat in the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion before leaving the Marine Corps in 2006 to attend the University of Phoenix, where he earned a Master of Business Administration degree in technology management.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from the University of Phoenix, Waugh worked as the director of Bowhead Support Services' Patuxent River Business Unit from 2006 to 2007, afterwards working as a systems engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory in southern Maryland. He served as an alternate member of the Calvert County Board of Appeals from 2011 to 2014.\nWaugh first became involved with politics in 2008 after what he described as the country taking a \"pretty serious left turn\". He unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland Senate in District 27 in 2010, losing to incumbent state senator Roy Dyson with 48.5 percent of the vote.\n\n\n=== Maryland Senate ===\nWaugh was elected to the Maryland Senate in 2014 after defeating Dyson. He was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 14, 2015. He served as a member of the Health and Environmental Affairs Committee during his entire tenure, including on its comptroller issues, education, and health subcommittees. Waugh was considered one of the most effective Republican legislators in the Maryland General Assembly during his tenure.\nDuring the 2015 legislative session, Waugh introduced a bill to ban wind energy projects east of the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, which he said would interfere with the air station's specialized radar system used to test the stealth capabilities of aircraft.\nDuring the 2017 legislative session, Waugh opposed bills that would require the Maryland Department of Transportation to prioritize road construction projects using a scoring system, give the attorney general of Maryland the ability to pursue cases against Trump administration policies, and ban fracking in Maryland. He also criticized President Donald Trump's proposal to cut all funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program in his 2018 fiscal year budget.\nIn August 2017, following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Waugh supported the removal of the Roger B. Taney Monument from the Maryland State House, saying that he didn't want it to \"become a rallying cry for white nationalists\".\nDuring the 2018 legislative session, Waugh criticized a bill to remove the Maryland Board of Public Works from hearing funding appeals from local officials, calling it the \"great mistake of this session\". He also introduced a bill to repeal sections of the Firearms Safety Act of 2013, including a ban on the sale of assault weapons. Following the Parkland high school shooting, Waugh led four bills aimed at addressing school safety, including one that would put armed school resource officers in every public school. Waugh also voted to override Governor Larry Hogan's veto on a bill prohibiting colleges from asking about criminal history on student applications, the only Republican member of the Maryland General Assembly to do so.\nWaugh ran for a second term in 2018. Governor Hogan—displeased with Waugh's legislative record, including on votes for legislation backed by Senate President Thomas V. Miller Jr. and veto overrides during the 2018 legislative session—supported his opponent, former Maryland Natural Resources police officer Jack Bailey, who defeated Waugh in the Republican primary election on June 26, 2018, by a margin of 752 votes. Waugh was the only Republican state senator to lose their primary election that year.\nIn a November 2018 interview with Maryland Independent, Waugh blamed Hogan for his loss, saying that his endorsement led to a tidal shift in party loyalty that overwhelmed his campaign. Following his defeat, he applied to a doctorate program in engineering.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWaugh is married to his wife, Myra. Together, they have two children.\nIn November 2011, Waugh and his son were involved in a plane crash at the Chesapeake Ranch Estates airport in Lusby, Maryland, that left him with multiple broken bones. The Federal Aviation Administration conducted an investigation into the plane crash, concluding that the crash occurred because of runway lights shining through the tall tree surrounding the runway, providing a \"false sense of safe approach\", and Waugh dragging the plane in \"a little bit low\" for a shallow landing. Waugh also blamed the environmental conditions at the airport, saying that a high overcast blocked all moonlight and starlight, creating a so-called black hole effect. In February 2012, Waugh's son received a \"hero proclamation\" from the Calvert County Board of County Commissioners for saving his father's life by pulling him from the aircraft following its crash.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tobias Whitaker (fl. 1634–1661) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhitaker was born probably in 1600 or 1601. He practised physic first in Norwich, and in 1634, while residing in that town, published ‘Περὶ ὑδροπωσιας,’ London, 12mo. Between 1634 and 1638 he went to London, and in 1638 brought out his most important work, ‘The Tree of Humane Life, or the Bloud of the Grape, proving the Possibilitie of maintaining Humane Life from Infancy to Extreame Old Age, without any Sicknesse, by the Use of Wine’ (London, 8vo). This defence of wine, which he regarded as a universal remedy against disease, was republished in 1654, and translated into Latin under the title ‘De Sanguine Uvæ’ (Frankfort, 1655, 8vo; Hague, 1660, 1663, 12mo). In September 1660 he was appointed physician in ordinary to the royal household with a salary of 50l. a year (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1660–1, p. 281). In 1661 he published ‘An Elenchus of Opinions concerning the Smallpox,’ London, 12mo, to which was prefixed his portrait engraved by John Chantrey; another edition appeared in 1671. Whitaker died early in 1666, before 21 May (cf. ib. 1664–5 p. 129, 1665–6 p. 406).\n‘The Tree of Life’ is ascribed by Wood to William Whitaker, a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians, who died in the parish of St. Clement Danes in January 1670-1 (Wood, Fasti Oxon., ed. Bliss, ii. 178; Foster, Alumni Oxon., 1500–1714; Munk, Royal Coll. of Phys. i. 268).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1900). \"Whitaker, Tobias\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.). Dictionary of National Biography. Vol. 61. London: Smith, Elder & Co. \n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Tobias Whitaker at Wikimedia Commons",

He surveyed land in northern England, mostly in Lancashire.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nYates grew up in the Low Hill parish of Walton, Liverpool.\n\n\n== Career ==\nEarly in his career, Yates was an assistant to Peter Perez Burdett.\nIn 1769, Yates completed a survey for the Map of the Environs of Liverpool.\nYates' survey of Lancashire (1786), at one inch to the mile, was \"one of the eleven English county maps which received national recognition in the period 1759–1809\". He received a gold medal from the Society of Arts.\nHis 1775 trigonometrical survey of Staffordshire was described as \"the last production of outstanding importance\" before the end of the 18th century.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn his will, made in 1802, Yates refers to his children: William Jr, George, Joseph, Sarah, Hannah and Patty.\nIn the 1770s, he was living in Cleveland Square and working as a customs officer. Twenty years later, he was a resident of West Derby, Liverpool, employed as a surveyor of customs.\n\n\n== Death ==\nYates died in Liverpool in 1802. He was interred at the city's St Thomas' Church on 30 November.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Swing (in Spanish: El columpio) is the title of a tapestry cartoon designed by Francisco de Goya for the bedroom of the Princes of Asturias in the Palace of El Pardo. It is kept in the Museo del Prado.\nThe subject of the oil painting is a recurring one in the history of Western art, especially in French painting, with Boucher and Fragonard, exponents of the Rococo. With obvious erotic connotations at the time, Goya may have discarded that sense of the subject, as it is a peaceful, familiar scene. It is the first of a series of thirteen tapestries undertaken in Goya's third series.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe scene takes place in the countryside, where three maids are swinging happily while the children they look after are enjoying themselves. The presence of ostentatious clothes on the children is noteworthy, an unmistakable symbol that they belong to the aristocracy. While the children are having fun, one of them swings the maid and another maid holds the youngest child. In the background, a carriage made of blurred spots can be seen, and three shepherds with their flocks complete the scene.\nThe children receive most of the illumination, as the twilight focuses on them and their clothes. Goya enhances the stain-like effect by applying a rapid brushstroke that years later would be the genesis of the Black Paintings. The greatest influences in the painting come from Rembrandt and Velázquez —\"his masters\", as Goya acknowledged— whom the painter greatly admired. The atmosphere is, in any case, calm and totally peaceful.\nThe woman who prevents the girl from walking is not dressed as a servant but as a courtesan. She is possibly a wealthy aristocrat who dresses like a maja, in keeping with the spirit of the times.\nWith his peculiar spelling, the Aragonese artist described the painting as \"a family who have gone out to the country to enjoy themselves, four children and three maids, one of whom is swinging on a rope\".\nSome authors have seen The Swing as an allegory of the three ages of life, through the children (childhood), the women (youth) and the shepherds in the distance (old age).\nIt may also be an ambiguous message, representing a meeting between the wet-nurses and the shepherds. This can be deduced from the gazes of the men and the woman with their backs turned.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCIRLOT, Lourdes (2007). Museo del Prado (in Spanish). Vol. 6 and 7.

        "content": "Tawapa was a diffuse hippie commune north of Placitas, New Mexico. It was founded in 1970, and it dissolved in the 1990s. It was located along Las Huertas Creek near the Sandia Mountains. There was also a spring in Tawapa, and watercress grew by the spring.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1970, there were problems at a commune called Lower Farm, so several couples left, and founded Tawapa along Las Huertas Creek. Many people, especially youth, settled in Tawapa in the 1970s. They heard about it by word of mouth and through magazines. During this time, several other communes were founded in the area, such as Sun Farm and Dome Valley. The people living in Tawapa claimed adverse possession over the land. However, they were ultimately evicted due to other people holding legal rights to Tawapa. Also, housing developments in the 1990s made people have to leave Tawapa.\nIn recent years, there has been a lot of environmental damage due to an increased number of houses being built, as well as groundwater mining.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ville Petman (born January 18, 2000) is a Finnish professional ice hockey forward for the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nPetman played junior hockey in the SM-sarja with SaiPa. In the 2015–16 season, he was named the captain of the club's C youth team. For the 2016–17 season, together with his younger brother Mikko, he moved to Rauman Lukko's B-youth team. Their mother, Seija, also moved to Rauma to support the brothers, who were only 15 and 16 years old at the time. In the 2017–18 season, Petman played mostly with Lukko's A-youth team, but he also debuted in the professional games after playing four regular season games on loan with the Mestis team KeuPa HT, scoring one goal.\nPetman went undrafted at the 2018 NHL Entry Draft, but he participated in the Los Angeles Kings' development camp that same summer. In that same summer, Petman would join Lukko's SM-Liiga team. He would start the 2018–19 season in the team's A-youth. Petman made his Liiga debut on December 11, 2018, against the Lahti Pelicans. A place in Lukko's lineup opened up when Manuel Ganahl's was called up to the Finnish national team. Petman was placed as a left wing on the team's fourth line, paired with Eetu Koivistonen and Aaro Vidgren. He finally got 8:11 minutes of ice time in the game. Petman would play 14 regular season games in the Liiga during the season, notching three assists.\nIn his actual Liiga rookie season 2019–20, Petman managed 2 goals and 6 assists in 40 regular season games. He scored the first goal of his Liiga career on December 13, 2019, against KalPa. In February 2020, Petman also played two games on loan for the Mestis team in SaPKo with his brother Mikko.\nFor the 2020–21 season, Petman returned to his original team, SaiPa, with a two-year contract, which he signed or March 23, 2020. Petman managed to score once during the season in the final game. For the 2021–22 season, Pekka Virta, whom he knew from Lukko, took over as SaiPa's head coach. Petman made his breakthrough in the Liiga and he always became the team's number one center, partly also after Jarno Koskiranta's season ended early due to injuries. He led SaiPa's in points, goals and assists with 15 goals and 24 assists for 39 points. On September 28, 2021, Petman signed a two-year contract extension with the team.\nIn June 2022, Petman signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL). At the end of Kraken's training camp, Petman was sent to the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the American Hockey League (AHL).\n\n\n== International play ==\nPetman played in the 2018 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he won gold representing Finland. He also played in the 2020 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, again representing Finland. Petman would also compete in the 2018 Hlinka Gretzky Cup.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Regular season and playoffs ===\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographical information and career statistics from Eliteprospects.com, or Eurohockey.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

        "content": "Vitaly Pliev is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the UN recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPliev made a small fortune as a businessman in his native Znaur District, establishing and operating a large trout, salmon, and sturgeon farm located in the village of Gufta along the Patsa River.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nPliev was elected the District Head of Znaur, surviving in that capacity when a Russian delegation, consisting of Rashid Nurgaliyev and Tatiana Golikova, where hosted in Znaur at the behest of president Leonid Tibilov. Tibilov would go on to be named to Tibilov's cabinet, as the minister of agriculture. In that capacity, Pliev joined a trade delegation to Golestan, Iran, led by Alan Tekhov, to open and develop trade between Iran and South Ossetia.\nAfter exiting politics Pliev remained a vocal member of the anti-establishment opposition, criticism the ruling Anatoly Bibilov during a 2022 incident where Georgian police established a checkpoint at the village of Tsnelis, which South Ossetia claimed was past the border established by the ceasefire to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Pliev blamed the crisis on the pro-Russian government, and claimed residents of Tsnelis, which South Ossetia claims as part of the Znaur district, reported as far back as his tenure as district head that Georgian police would often launch excursions into the village, but that the government did nothing about it.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Voice of Europe case was one of a number of uncovered influence operations on European politics. In 2024 the Czech secret intelligence service (BIS) uncovered a Russian state financed pro-russian influence network with the public outlet Voice of Europe, using right-wing and Eurosceptic politicians to influence e.g. the European elections. The network is suspected to have bribed several European politicians from different countries.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to a report released on March 28, 2024, by the BIS, published by Czech newspaper Denník N, Russia paid hundreds of thousands of Euros through its Prague-based right-wing rhetoric \"Voice of Europe\" website to European politicians (mainly from The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Hungary and Poland) in order to influence influence European elections in favour of positions against Ukraine and the EU, by means of right-wing, Eurosceptic politicians.\nExamples of politicians allegedly implicated in the campaign include Dutch FvD party leader Thierry Baudet, who was interviewed by the \"Voice of Europe\", and Belgian Filip Dewinter of Vlaams Belang party. Baudet himself systematically denied receiving such donations, notably during a parliamentary debate on an exit from the EU.\nAccording to a quote of a senior Czech official published by Denník N, “The main purpose of Voice of Europe was to spread the frame that peace is only possible if Ukraine gives up the right to defend its sovereignty and integrity”. According to BIS,  the \"Voice of Europe\" was run by Viktor Medvedchuk, a former Ukrainian oligarch who has been close friends with Russian President Putin for many years. Medvedchuk was immediately placed on the sanctions list by the Czech Republic, as was his close associate Artem Marchevsky.\nVoice of Europe has also been put on the sanctions list, meaning all financial assets have been frozen. The news site can continue to operate, but money can no longer be transferred to people affiliated with it.\n\"Voice of Europe\" news reports have stated that foreigners are responsible for more than half of all serious crimes in Frankfurt, Germany, and that French President Macron's campaign on the Russian danger is not appealing to French voters, according to recent polls. Le Monde has reported that the DGSI was investigating a pro-Russian campaign towards the European elections next June.\n\n\n== Website ==\nThe website has its roots in the Netherlands. An entrepreneur linked to the site at the time “worked with” far-right leader Thierry Baudet in 2016 “to bring about the Ukraine referendum,” a Dutch newspaper wrote, referring to a nonbinding vote in which Dutch voters opposed a political association agreement between Ukraine and the EU.\nIn 2023, Voice of Europe was relaunched and from then on had an address near Wenceslas Square in Prague. In March 2024, a Polish businessman, Jacek Jakubczyk, took over all shares in the company in the legal form of a s.r.o.\n\n\n== Involved politicans ==\nVoice of Europe’s YouTube page throws up a parade of EU lawmakers, many of them belonging to far-right Euroskeptic parties. They agreed in opposedagainst the Green Deal, predict the Union’s imminent collapse or attack Ukraine.\n\nThierry Baudet, Dutch FvD. Baudet was interviewed by the \"Voice of Europe\" and systematically denied receiving donations, notably during a parliamentary debate on an exit from the EU.\nFilip Brusselmans, Belgian politician and political activist.\nPetr Bystron, German AfD, candidate for European Elections 2024. In April 2024 the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office initiated preliminary investigations because of possible bribery of elected officials. According to Die Zeit, Public Prosecuter Office suspected that 20,000 euros were handed over at a meeting between Bystron and employees of Russian propaganda in Prague.\nFilip Dewinter, Vlaams Belang party\nMatteo Gazzini, Italian Forza Italia, former Lega Nord. He gave Voice of Europe an interview and participated in a panel debate alongside other MEPs. He denied being offered or taking any money.\nMaximilan Krah, German AfD, top-candicate  for European Elections 20244 and already MEP.\n\n\n== Investigations and governmental reactions ==\nThe Czech foreign ministry sanctioned oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as well as Voice of Europe itself and a person called Artem Pavlovich Marchevskyi presumed to be involved in the operation.\nPolish security services declared, they had carried out searches as part of the cross-border investigation in Warsaw and Tychy in western Poland. Local media cited the security services' statement saying authorities had seized €48,500 and $36,000.\n\n\n== Political Reactions ==\n\"The Kremlin is using dodgy outlets pretending to be media [and] using money to buy covert influence,” said Czech European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRussian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum\nRussian Laundromat\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sir Peter Wedderburn, Lord Gosford (1616? – 11 November 1679) was a Scottish judge.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWedderburn was the third son of James Wedderburn, town clerk of Dundee. Sir Alexander Wedderburn was his elder brother. He was born at Dundee about 1616, and was educated at St. Andrews, where he graduated M.A. in 1636. He was admitted advocate on 19 January 1642, and speedily attained prominence at the bar. In January 1658–9 he acquired the estate of Gosford House, Haddingtonshire, from Sir Alexander Auchmuty, not, as is stated in Douglas's ‘Baronage,’ from his uncle, Sir John Wedderburn, who advanced money for the purpose as he had no children and had decided to make Peter his heir. Wedderburn remained firmly attached to the royalists during the civil war; and at the Restoration he was knighted and made keeper of the signet for life, with power to appoint deputies. In July 1661 he was appointed clerk to the privy council, and on 17 June 1668 he was raised to the bench as an ordinary lord of session, with the title of Lord Gosford. He represented the constabulary of Haddington in the conventions almost continuously from 1661 until 1674. He died at Gosford on 11 November 1679. He married, first, in 1649, Christian Gibson, by whom he had one son, who died in infancy; and secondly, in 1653, Agnes, daughter of John Dickson, Lord Hartree of session, and had five sons and four daughters. The second son, Peter (1658–1746), assumed the name of Halkett on marrying Jane, daughter of Sir Charles Halkett, and heiress of her brother, Sir James Halkett; he is represented by Sir Peter Arthur Halkett of Pitfirrane, bart. Sir Peter Wedderburn's third son was grandfather of Alexander Wedderburn, first earl of Rosslyn. Lord Gosford published ‘A Collection of Decisions of the Court of Session from 1 June 1668 till July 1677,’ which is still accepted as authoritative. He was regarded as an eloquent advocate and an upright judge, ‘whose deeds were prompted by truthfulness, and whose law was directed by justice and sympathy.’\nA portrait of Sir Peter was in the possession of Sir William Wedderburn at Meredith, England,  and is reproduced in ‘The Wedderburn Book.’ Another portrait was at Leslie House, and was sold in 1886.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Millar, Alexander Hastie (1899). \"Wedderburn, Peter\".

        "content": "Yuriy Mykhaylovych Mushketyk (Ukrainian: Ю́рій Миха́йлович Мушке́тик; 21 March 1929 – 6 June 2019) was a Ukrainian novelist and journalist who earned the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2009. In his thirty years of writing, he created multiple plays, several novels, and collections of short stories in addition to publishing over 10 books.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn on 21 March 1929, in the Ukrainian village of Vertiivka. Mushketyk completed the typical rural school curriculum from childhood. The war cruelly severed the his connection, just like it did with his peers. A number of military books would draw on the author's personal experiences of those turbulent times, which subsequently served as the inspiration for the novella Lights in the Night (1959). After graduating from Shevchenko University's Faculty of Philology in 1953, he pursues three more years of postgraduate work at the Department of Ukrainian Literature.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1954, Mushketyk made his literary debut with the publication of his first piece, a story titled Semen Paliy. That same year, he joined the Union of Writers of the USSR. He began working as the head editor of the magazine Dnipro from 1956 to 1972 and eventually rose to the position of editor-in-chief over his 20 years there.\n\nIn his writings, Mushketyk does more than just recount the actual events; he also crafts stories centered around universal issues and internal struggles, which are essential to human existence. Specifically, the pieces Black Bread (1960) and Fires in the Middle of the Night (1959) depict the pre-war and Nazi occupation of Ukraine. His works Heart and Stone (1962) and Drop of Blood (1964) effectively depict human situations, raising serious moral issues when lofty ideals expressed in words do not match reality. Other notable novels written by him includes The Last Island (1969), Green Rye (1965), and the tale The Day Flies Over Us (1967).\nThrough his works White Shadow (1977), Pain (1978), Position (1979), and Rubezh (1984), he attained depth on a psychological and philosophical level by bringing up the real, universal, timeless issue of humanity and the planet. Novels and stories from the 1970s and 1980s marked a new phase in his development: Cruel Mercy (1973), Death of Socrates, The Court of Seneca (1978), Return to Your Home (1981), Vikhola (1982), The Collapse, Yellow Flower of the Dandelion and The Tear of Ophelia (1985). The pages of Yasa (1987) are devoted to the notion of unifying the Ukrainian people and the valiant battle of the masses against foreign invaders; in 1990, Borys Shylenko developed the screenplay and directed the film Black Valley, which was based on the novel.\nMushketyk released a historical fiction book titled On Brother Brother (1996), about Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky attempting to establish a Ukrainian Cossack state following the passing of the Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and he concentrated on finding a counterbalance to the expanding Moscow armies during this period, which he recreated in his work. The protagonists of his works are well-known figures from Ukrainian history, including Ivan Mazepa, Maksym Zalizniak, Ivan Sirko, Petro Doroshenko and Pavlo Polubotok. Their actions take place against the backdrop of a trustworthy, multifaceted picture of Ukrainian life, drawing on an enormous amount of historical sources as well as theoretical and historical studies that he has studied.\nIn 1989, Mushketyk was later elected as the first secretary of the board of the Kyiv organization of the Union of Writers of Ukrainian SSR. He was the chairman of the Union of Writers of Ukrainian SSR Council from 1989; actively participated in the fight for the resuscitation of the Ukrainian language and culture. In 1995, the Ukrainian Academy of Original Ideas made him an academician, and a people's deputy in the 11th session of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada.\nOn 6 June 219, Mushketyk passed away at the age of 90. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers bid him farewell and was buried at Baikove Cemetery.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nMushketyk viewed that historical occurrences repeat themselves because Russia has pushed to keep Ukraine from becoming independent in the past and continues to do so now. Even though Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich wanted to believe that Ukrainians would one day leave and found their own nation, it has been going on since then. The fact that the Ukrainian people have persevered for so many centuries serves as another evidence of their capacity for battle.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMushketyk's mother led the communal farm for a while, while his father was employed as an educator. He was married to Lina Serhiivna, and together have two daughters, the eldest being Lesya, a folklorist and leading researcher at the Rylsky Institute of Art Studies, Folklore and Ethnology. His youngest daughter Oksana is a Ukrainian Academy of Printing graduate. His wife passed away in February 2008.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\nMushketyk has received other awards and recognitions such as:\n\n Hero of Ukraine Order of the State (20 March 2009)\nAlexander Dovzhenko Medal (2018)\nIvan Mazepa Medal (18 March 2016)\nGolden Writer of Ukraine (2012)\nAntonovych Prize (1996)\nState Prize of the USSR (1987)\nShevchenko National Prize (1980)\nMykola Ostrovsky Prize (1965)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Anna Maria Suckling (b. Sutton Coldfield, 1863 – d. Oxford, 9 April 1946) was the first County Commissioner for Girl Guides in Warwickshire. She was recipient of the Silver Fish Award, the Girl Guide movement's highest award for adults.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnna Maria Jerome was born in 1863 to John and Mary Jerome. She was the oldest of five children. The family home was Holland House, Sutton Coldfield. She married Cornelius William Suckling (1856–1935), a surgeon, in 1881. They lived in Edgbaston and had two sons, John and Cornelius. She was living in Oxford when she died.\n\n\n== Girl Guides ==\nSuckling became involved with Girl Guiding in 1910, one year after the movement's foundation. Between 1913 and 1921 she served as the first County Commissioner for  Girl Guiding in Warwickshire. Suckling organised the movement across the Midlands with membership increasing so significantly during her time that between 1912 and 1921 six additional Division Commissioners were appointed. In July 1913, Lord and Lady Baden-Powell inspected 150 Girl Guides representing nine companies at the Suckling's home.\nSuckling received the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding's highest adult honour, in 1921. It was presented by the Chief Guide, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, at Warwickshire's first Guide Rally, at Shrubland Park in Leamington Spa. Suckling resigned from her position as County Commissioner in October 1921 but continued to be involved in Guiding until at least 1924.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay (金銀鈿荘唐大刀, kin gin den kazari no kara-tachi) is an 8th century Japanese sword in the chokutō (直刀, lit. 'straight sword') style.  It was one of Emperor Shōmu's favorite swords and was handed down in the Shōsōin Repository.\nBecause it is an imperial treasure, it is not open to the public, but is sometimes exhibited at the Shōsōin exhibition held in Nara Prefecture every fall.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nAccording to the Tōdai-ji Offering Book (東大寺献物帳), a list of offerings made by Empress Kōmyō to Tōdai-ji temple after Emperor Shōmu's death, 100 large-scale swords (御大刀壹佰口) were stored in the north storage room (北倉) of the Shōsōin.\nThese include three double-edged swords (剣), nine kake-hake swords (懸佩刀, lit. 'sword hanging from a belt'), 44 large swords (大刀), 41 large swords in black sheaths (黒作大刀), one side sword (横刀), and two staff swords (杖刀).\nThe above 44 large swords can be further classified into 13 kara-tachi swords (唐大刀, lit. 'Tang large swords'), 23 large swords, 6 kara style swords (唐様大刀, kara-yō tachi, lit. 'Tang-style large swords'), and 2 koma style large swords (高麗様大刀, lit. 'Goguryeo-style large swords').\nOf the 100 large-scale swords mentioned above, 4 double-edged swords and one large sword were removed from the Shōsōin on January 18, 760. In addition, on September 11, 764, 48 large swords and 40 large swords in black sheaths were removed from the Shōsōin, probably due to their use during the Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion. The number of large swords does not match the Tōdai-ji Offering Book, but it may include kake-hake swords and others. \nTherefore, of the 100 large-scale swords, 93 had been removed from the Shōsōin by 764, and of the remaining 7, only 1 large sword and 2 staff swords are known to exist, while 4 are missing. However, there are 49 large swords of unknown origin in the middle storage room (中倉) and three large swords in the south storage room (南倉) of the Shōsōin, and it is possible that the large swords originally stored in the north storage room were later returned and mixed up.\nThe Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay corresponds to the extant 1 large sword. It is the fourth large sword listed in the catalog of large-scale swords in the Tōdai-ji Offering Book.\n\n金銀鈿荘唐大刀一口\n刃長二尺六寸四分 鋒者両刃 鮫皮把作山形\n葛形裁文 鞘上末金鏤作 白皮懸 紫皮帯執\n\n黒紫羅帯 緋地高麗錦袋浅緑綾裏\nThe Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay: 1\nBlade length: 2 shaku 6 sun 4 bu. Sharkskin hilt and mountain-shaped metal fittings on the scabbard.\nVine-shaped patterns. The surface of the scabbard is decorated with Makkinru (末金鏤). Cord made of white leather. Two cords to hang on the belt made of purple leather.\nA black-purple thin silk belt. Bag of red Goguryeo brocade. The lining cloth of the bag is a light green twill weave.\n\nKara-tachi (literally, Tang large sword) used to mean a sword made in Tang China, and kara-yō tachi (literally, Tang style sword) was thought to mean a sword made in Japan in imitation of the Tang large sword. However, since no conclusion has been reached as to whether the kara-tachi's blade and exterior (hilt and scabbard) were made in China or Japan, the term kara-tachi is now interpreted to mean \"Tang-style large sword\" (唐風の大刀).\n\n\n== Blade and Exterior ==\n\nThe blade type is kiriha-zukuri (切刃造り), in which the mountain-shaped bulge on the side, called shinogi (鎬), is closer to the cutting edge side of the blade. This type is common in swords of the Nara period. It is a single-edged type called kissaki-moroha-zukuri (鋒両刃造), in which only the tip of the blade is double-edged. A similar example is the Kogarasu Maru. The shape of the blade is a straight sword (直刀, chokutō) with a slightly curved blade. The shape of the mune (棟, opposite the cutting edge) is a chamfered 3-mune type.\nThe shape of the nakago (茎, hilt side of the blade) is a kurijiri (栗尻) in the shape of a chestnut, with two holes, one for mekugi (目釘, nail to fix hilt and blade) and the other for kake-dōshi (懸通し), through which the kake (懸, cord) is threaded. Although the exterior of the sword is ceremonial in appearance, the excellence of the blade's forging is considered to be unparalleled.\nThe hilt is wrapped in sharkskin (actually stingray skin), and a metal fitting with an arabesque design in openwork is attached to the end of the hilt. The tsuba (鍔, guard) is decorated with a design of small dots called nanako (魚子, lit. 'fish roe') with an arabesque design in relief on the surface, and a flower-shaped ornamental metal fitting is placed over the hole for a mekugi. The white leather kake (cord) connected to the hilt with a silver ring has been replaced by a repair.\nThe scabbard is made of wood and lacquered in black lacquer. Three metal fittings are attached to the scabbard and one to the kojiri (鐺, chape of the scabbard), which are openworked with an arabesque pattern similar to that on the pommel of the hilt. Two of these four fittings are each fitted with a mountain-shaped fitting that connects the obitori (帯執り, belt strap). Two purple leather obitori with white patterns are attached to the mountain-shaped fittings.\nThe metal fittings are all silver with gold plating, most of which has peeled off, and are decorated in places with colored glass and crystal balls, and under the crystal balls are painted in vermilion.\nThe makkinru (末金鏤, lit. 'Sprinkling gold powder') technique on the scabbard is one of the lacquer techniques and is the same as the maki-e polishing technique used today. The patterns are drawn in lacquer, sprinkled with gold powder, coated with more lacquer, and then polished out with patterns of flowers, clouds, and animals.\nThe belt and bag that came with the sword were lost and have not been handed down.\n\n\n== Controversy over the place of production ==\nSince the term makkinru is a unique Japanese name that does not exist in China, and since no examples of crafts using this technique can be found in China, there has long been a dispute over whether the scabbard was made in Japan or China.\nKurokawa Mayori interprets makkinru as a technique in which gold is powdered with a rasp and sprinkled over black lacquer to create a pattern, and places it at the origin of maki-e in later Japan. He also assumes that kara-tachi means a sword made in Tang dynasty China, and he considers the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay to be made in China, and therefore the makkinru technique was also introduced to Japan from China. Since maki-e, in which pictures are drawn by sprinkling gold powder, does not exist in China, maki-e is assumed to have been created in Japan from makkinru.\nOn the other hand, Rokkaku Shisui interprets kara-tachi to mean that the blade was made in China and does not refer to the place of production of the entire sword, including the exterior, and argues that the decoration and making of the scabbard are also different from those of the Chinese. He also claims that although there are many paintings in China made by the kondei (金泥, lit. 'gold mud') technique, in which gold powder is dissolved in oil or glue and painted with a brush, there are no paintings in China made by sprinkling gold powder like Japanese maki-e, and that makkinru is also Japanese in origin.\nRecent research has shown that the gold powder particles used in the scabbard vary in size and cannot be reproduced using a modern rasp, but can be reproduced using a rasp equivalent to the one found in a carpenter's tool called Ten knives in clustered sheaths (十合鞘御刀子), a treasure of the Shōsōin Repository. It was also revealed that the patterns on the scabbard were not drawn by the kondei technique but by a technique similar to maki-e.\nRecent research has shown that 95% of the Shōsōin treasures are thought to be of Japanese origin, although they are decorated with foreign designs, it is still unclear whether the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay was of Japanese or foreign origin.\n\nThe arabesque kuzura-gata Saimon (葛形裁文) design on the metal fittings decorating the pommel of the hilt and scabbard is the same pattern found on the Remnants of Dress and Crown (ja:礼服御冠残欠), the crown remnants of Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōmyō in Shōsōin, and it was quite possible to produce such metal fittings using Japanese metal engraving techniques of the time. However, no Tang dynasty sword with similar metal fittings has been excavated. There are no surviving Tang dynasty swords other than those excavated from tombs, and there are very few excavated examples.\nOne known sword was excavated in 1992 from the tomb of Dòu Jiǎo (窦曒, d. 627) in Xi'an, but the shape of the pommel of the hilt is that of a ring-pommel sword, which is different from the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay.\nThe ring-pommel sword was also called Koma tsurugi (狛剣, lit. 'sword of Goguryeo') in ancient Japan, and it is believed that it was so called because it was initially introduced to Japan from Goguryeo. At that time, Goguryeo was called Koma in Japan. The swords described as \"Koma style\" (高麗様) in the Tōdai-ji Offering Book fall into this category. Therefore, \"Tang\" and \"Koma\" (Goguryeo) do not strictly refer to the place of production of the sword, but rather to the style of the sword's exterior.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKurokawa, Mayori (1910). 黒川真頼全集 第３ 美術篇、工芸篇 [The Complete Works of Mayori Kurokawa Vol.3 Arts, Crafts].

Sir Peter Wedderburn was his younger brother. Alexander was educated for the law and passed advocate; but upon the death of his uncle Alexander of Kingennie, whose son was then a minor, he was in 1633 appointed town clerk of Dundee, and held the office till 1675. For his steadfast loyalty he obtained from Charles I in 1639 a tack of the customs of Dundee, and in 1640 a pension of 100l. per annum out of the customs. In September of the same year he was appointed one of the eight Scots commissioners to arrange the treaty of Ripon. In October following he had an exoneration and ratification from the king, and in 1642 a knighthood was conferred on him. He represented Dundee in the Scottish parliament, 1644–7 and 1648–51 (Return of Members of Parliament), and he served on numerous committees of the estates. At the Restoration in 1661 he was appointed one of the commissioners for regulating weights and measures; and on 10 February 1664 he received from Charles II a pension of 100l. sterling. He died on 18 November 1676. By Matilda, daughter of Sir Andrew Fletcher of Innerpeffer, he had five sons and six daughters. His second son, James (1649–1696), was grandfather of Sir John Wedderburn (1704–1746).\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1899). \"Wedderburn, Alexander (1610-1676)\".

        "content": "Bolivia Mar (also written Boliviamar) is a beach south of Ilo, Peru, ceded in 1992 by the Peruvian government to Bolivia for a renewable period of 99 years. It is located in Ilo Province in the Department of Moquegua, currently administered of the city of Ilo until Bolivia assumes its administration. The agreement was signed by Alberto Fujimori and Jaime Paz Zamora, then presidents of Peru and Bolivia, respectively.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIt was projected that the concession would serve to reduce commercial ties with the Chilean ports of Iquique and Arica, where Bolivia enters and ships most of its merchandise, and finally leave behind the belief that its access to the ocean depends on the country that kept the Litoral Department, which gave it access to the Pacific Ocean after the war of the same name (1879–1884), in which Bolivia and Peru faced Chile.\nThe Ilo agreements signed in 1992 stipulated \"the transfer of Bolivia Mar.\" But also two other elements: creating an industrial free zone in the Peruvian city of Ilo and providing facilities to Bolivians so that they can use the port facilities of that town. The agreement did not mean territorial secession or Bolivian freedom to do what best suits it; this expressed the disagreement of the Bolivian Consulate in Ilo, which expressed that the Bolivian State is not allowed to build a port and the beach is only limited to tourist trade.\nAlso weighing heavily is the fact that the Bolivian government does not see investing in Bolivia Mar as feasible, since this would affect its geopolitical aspirations against Chile, since the Government in Santiago would use it as an excuse to flatly deny granting it any sovereign enclave or salient.\nStrategically, Bolivia prefers to invest in the port of Ilo to counteract Arica and Iquique, in this way it does not intervene in its foreign policy of going to sea through northern Chile, and at the same time manage to reduce its dependence on northern Chilean ports.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe beginning of the development of an enclave for Bolivia on the southern Peruvian coast began after the terrorist attack by Sendero Luminoso on the Bolivian embassy in Lima on July 22. La Paz demanded compensation in good faith from the government of Alberto Fujimori due to that incident committed against their diplomatic delegation, this caused the government of both countries to begin talks that came to the idea of a trading post in Ilo for Bolivia as compensation for the destruction of the diplomatic office.\nThe 1992 agreement agreed by Fujimori and Jaime Paz Zamora sought the construction of tourist centres by Bolivia, but the steep terrain and difficult access forced an investment of a few hundred million dollars to build the necessary infrastructure. Bolivia has not had the initiative, probably due to lack of resources.\nIn 2022, then Peruvian president Pedro Castillo spoke about the possibility of giving access to the sea to Bolivia through a popular consultation, which sparked a controversy in Peru against Castillo, leading to a complaint for treason, for which the Peruvian president had to clarify his position, mentioning that he was referring to the territory of Bolivia Mar, as well as an expansion of the area.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nA sign at the Pan-American Highway marks the entrance to the beach through a dirt road leading to a monument\nDos Mujeres (Spanish for \"Two women\"), a 21-metre metal sculpture featuring two female faces: one looking towards the sea, and another towards Bolivia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCECONA, located in Peru and under Ecuadorian administration\nPort of Arica, located in Chile and under Peruvian administration\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Life Takes Place: Phenomenology, Lifeworlds, and Place Making is a book by American geographer and phenomenologist David Seamon. It was published in 2018 by Routledge. The book explores the significance of place in human existence within the context of our modern, mobile society. Through a phenomenological lens, Seamon delves into the multifaceted nature of places, emphasizing their role in gathering, activating, and interconnecting various elements of human experience. Drawing on practical examples from fields such as architecture and urban design, Seamon advocates for a holistic understanding of place that informs rigorous place-making practices, ultimately contributing to the enrichment of environmental experiences.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book explores of the relationship between life and place from a phenomenological perspective. Through a detailed analysis, Seamon introduces the concept of 'synergistic relationality' as a holistic approach to understanding the dynamic nature of place. The book outlines an interpretive methodology, drawing from Systems Theory, to examine the interconnectedness of experiences, actions, and meanings within various environments. It aims to develop a comprehensive phenomenology of place while addressing critical concerns and historical perspectives. Seamon emphasizes the embodied nature of human activities within their surroundings and advocates for a deeper understanding of place beyond rationalist approaches. Through the lens of progressive approximation, the book navigates through the complexities of place, revealing hidden structures and interconnected relationships.\n\n\n=== The six places processes ===\nA major phenomenological question asked by Seamon in the book is how places change for better or worse. Are there underlying lived processes impelling ways that places are what they are and what they become? To answer this question, he identified six processes that can work in constructive or undermining ways. He defined these six processes as follows:\n\nPlace interaction: The typical goings-on in a place and the constellation of actions, situations, and events unfolding in that place. One speaks of the “rounds of a place, “the seasons of a place,” or “a day in the life of the place.” Some place interactions are routine and taken for granted, while others are occasional or once-in-a-lifetime.\nPlace identity: People associated with place take up that place as a significant part of their world. Place becomes integral to a personal and communal sense of self and self-worth. If people live their entire lives in one place, place identity is an integral aspect of who people are. Today, many people regularly change places, and strong place identity is less certain, since it requires time and continual, active involvement with place.\nPlace release: Happenstance encounters and events arising because of serendipitous moments in place. Through surprising, unexpected engagements and situations in place, people are “released” more deeply into themselves. Partly because of serendipitous experiences offered by place, “life is good.”\nPlace realization: The distinctive environmental presence fostered by both tangible and intangible qualities of place, including ambience and atmosphere. The place evokes a unique feeling and character that is as real in itself as the people who know and experience that place. The less effable aspects of place realization relate to “sense of place” or spirit of place.”\nPlace intensification: The independent power of the physical and spatial environment to contribute actively to human wellbeing and place quality. The independent power of the material, designable aspects of place to make a difference in the actions, experiences, and meanings of a place. The recognition that environmental and spatial features of place can strengthen or weaken the quality of life-in-place.\nPlace creation: People responsible for a place draw on their commitment to that place to envision and fabricate creative changes that make the place better. Individuals and groups associated with a place empathize with that place and generate designs, plans, policies, and actions that respect the place and make it more actualized, robust, and whole.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael J. Broadway praised the book and commended its intellectually stimulating exploration of the essence of geography and place. He particularly valued the author's phenomenological approach and sequential organization, which effectively build upon each chapter's content. Broadway appreciated the book's holistic perspective on place, emphasizing its relevance to human existence and well-being.\n\nAndrew Turk wrote:David Seamon’s latest book Life Takes Place: Phenomenology, Lifeworlds, and Place Making (2018) is very readable for those from disciplines other than the obvious ones of architecture, urban planning, geography and philosophy. The content and structure of this book provides both an introduction to the topic and a summary of key issues.Thomas Barclay Larsen praised Seamon's adept synthesis of phenomenology and humanistic geography, highlighting the value of understanding place through lived experience. He commended the book for its significant contributions to the humanistic tradition in geography, suggesting it as essential reading for students and researchers interested in exploring the dynamic relationships between people and place. Larsen wrote:Life Takes Place aims to further emplace our thinking about the human condition, to elucidate 'the significance of places in human life and how they might be envisioned and made to strengthen human well-being.'\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhenomenology (philosophy)\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty\nAnne Buttimer\nEdward S.

        "earliest_creation_date": "2006-12-01 08:34:11",
        "content": "The Plogoff nuclear power plant project is an EDF project to build a nuclear power plant in the commune of Plogoff in Finistère, Brittany. Popular mobilization against the project between 1978 and 1981 led to its abandonment. This anti-nuclear movement was part of a period marked by the birth of political ecology worldwide.\n\n\n== Plogoff site ==\nPlogoff is a commune in Basse-Bretagne, near the Pointe du Raz in Finistère. The nuclear power plant would have been located on the edge of Audierne Bay.\n\n\n== Chronology of Events ==\nIn response to the first oil crisis in October 1973, the first Pierre Messmer government accelerated the civil nuclear program, and on March 5, 1974, launched an ambitious program of 13 900-megawatt units over six years (at an estimated cost of 13 billion francs), with plans to build 200 power plants in France by 2000.\nIn 1975, the General Councils and the Economic and Social Council agreed in principle to build a nuclear power plant in Brittany on 167 hectares of Breton moorland (4 generating units of 1,300 MW each, for a total capacity of 5,200 MW). Five sites have been identified for prospecting in Brittany: Beg an Fry in Guimaëc, Ploumoguer, Plogoff (near Pointe du Raz), Saint-Vio in Tréguennec and Erdeven. In June 1976, EDF engineers began drilling the first exploratory boreholes, triggering the first major reactions from the local population, which until then had been largely uninformed. The mobilization in Erdeven and Ploumoguer was such that these sites were quickly ruled out.\nA defense committee was formed on June 6, at the initiative of the mayor of Plogoff, Jean-Marie Kerloch. On June 8, Plogoffites set up barricades at the entrance to their commune for three days, as EDF geologists and technicians were forced to give way. On September 11, 1978, this committee decided to create a GFA (based on the Larzac model) to make expropriation procedures more difficult6. Despite the structuring of the anti-nuclear movement, notably through CLINs and CRINs, the Plogoff site was selected on September 12 and 25, 1978 by the Conseil économique et social de Bretagne and the Conseil général du Finistère. On November 29, 1978, the General Council of Finistère voted 28 to 17 in favor of building a nuclear power plant at Plogoff, marking the end of the period of the \"strolling power plant\".\nCitizen opposition continued unabated: in early May 1979, the defense committee decided to install the Feunteun-Aod alternative sheepfold on the GFA. On January 30, 1980, the files for the public utility inquiry were received at Plogoff town hall, where they were burnt that very afternoon. The prefectural authorities responded by hiring vans to act as \"annex town halls\" (protected by gendarmes) to gather the population's favorable opinions, so that the public utility inquiry could begin on January 31, 1980.\nDuring the public inquiry, a free radio station - Radio Plogoff - began broadcasting. It broadcast radio programs until the Socialist victory in 1981.\nAfter the public inquiry, demonstrations took place, leading to sometimes violent clashes with the CRS. On several occasions, demonstrators were arrested and put on trial for damaging public buildings and throwing projectiles, with the struggle now seen as a battle of \"stones against guns\".\nOn March 16, 1980, 50,000 people demonstrated to mark the closure of the public utility inquiry. On May 24, 1980, 100 to 150,000 demonstrators celebrated the end of the procedure, with 50 to 60,000 staying on for the fest-noz that brought the festivities to a close.\nOn April 9, 1981, at his rally in Brest, candidate François Mitterrand declared that Plogoff \"does not figure, nor will it figure\" in the nuclear plan he would implement if elected. In keeping with his campaign promise, the press release of June 3, 1981, issued after the Council of Ministers of President Mitterrand's Mauroy government, confirmed the abandonment of plans to extend the Larzac military camp and build the Plogoff nuclear power plant. Instead, two coal-fired units, each rated at 600 MW, were added to the Cordemais power plant in 1983 and 1984. A 446 MW gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in the commune of Landivisiau, in the north of the Finistère département, goes into production on March 31, 2022.\n\n\n== The Plogoff women ==\nWomen played a particularly important role in this mobilization. Many were seamen's wives, and therefore often single homemakers. Along with young people and pensioners, they are the most present in the village and very active in this struggle.\nWhen the vans, protected by mobile guards, were set up to act as a town hall annex, the women began a war of nerves with the gendarmes. During the six weeks of the public inquiry, they mobilized daily, spending hours and sometimes days in front of the guards, talking to them and sometimes discouraging the younger ones. At 5 p.m., as the women leave the town halls, they are joined by men and anti-nuclear activists from the region. This \"five o'clock mass\" often takes a more violent turn, involving the use of Molotov cocktails, with the gendarmes retaliating with offensive grenades.\nDuring the clashes, women were also in the front ranks, blocking the way of the gendarmes. They included Annie Carval, now president of the defense committee (in place of Jean-Marie Kerloc'h, who was accused of allowing himself to be influenced by EDF), and Amélie Kerloc'h, first deputy and then mayor of the commune. The latter encouraged residents to block access to Plogoff to make it \"an island inaccessible to the police\".\nA film, Plogoff, des pierres contre des fusils, recounts the events and shows the mobilization of the women, who harassed the young mobile guards every day, causing several of them to break down. At the head of the Plogoff mobilization are Amélie Kerloc'h, Plogoff's first deputy mayor, who is seen in the film urging outraged demonstrators to \"make Plogoff an island\", and Annie Carval, president of the defense committee. Plogoff, des pierres contre des fusils was directed by Nicole Le Garrec, with Félix Le Garrec as a cinematographer and Jakez Bernard as a sound technician. Released in November 1980 (before the project was abandoned), the film was restored in 2019 and selected for Cannes Classics 2019 (the Cannes Film Festival's selection of heritage films). It was re-released in cinemas on February 12.\nA book entitled Femmes de Plogoff (Women of Plogoff) has been published by Renée Conan and Annie Laurent. In it, they recount how they learned to fight, the violence they had to face, The changes in their family lives during this time, the courage they showed, and the connections they forged with each other and with other struggles elsewhere.\nA show based on the book was staged by Laëtitia Rouxel (drawing), Brigitte Stanislas (reading), and Patrice Paichereau (music).\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nSeven squadrons of mobile gendarmes were stationed in Pont-Croix and Loctudy, and intervened in Plogoff. Gendarmes-parachutistes were deployed as reinforcements.\nThe mobile gendarmes sometimes use wheeled armored vehicles at Plogoff. A helicopter watched over the demonstrators. It was there to protect the movement of the annexed city halls. Military engineering vehicles from Angers were mobilized to breach the barricades.\nIn terms of weaponry, incapacitating grenades were used in large numbers, including \"instant tear-gas grenades\" (tolite + CS gas) (e.g. 85 on Friday, March 14, the last day of the public inquiry). Ethyl bromoacetate, although banned, seems to have been used by urban police during riots in Quimper, who are said to have disposed of old stocks.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nFollowing a major mobilization, the project was abandoned, a first in France. The previous year, a demonstration at Creys-Malville had had tragic consequences: one demonstrator was killed, and many others injured, including a mobile guard whose hand was torn off. Parallel to this action, demonstrations occurred at Le Pellerin, near Nantes, where another nuclear power plant was planned. This was abandoned in 1983, as promised by Socialist candidate François Mitterrand, before being replaced by another project, the Le Carnet nuclear power plant, also abandoned in 1997.\n\n\n== Posterity ==\nThe Tri Yann music group, opposed to the project, wrote the eponymous song for the album An heol a zo glaz, released in 1981. Kan ar kann (Breton for \"song of combat\") describes the struggle of the people of Plogoff to oppose the construction of a nuclear power plant.\nThe Iroise Marine Natural Park was created by decree on September 28, 2007. Covering an area of 3,500 km2, it is likely to be extended, with a proposal to the communes of Cap Sizun (of which Plogoff is a part) to involve them in decision-making and take into account the ecological and socio-economic coherence of the professional and leisure activity basins.\nOn April 22, 2021, France 3 broadcast the film Plogoff, les révoltés du nucléaire (2021, France, 55 minutes) by François Reinhardt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of history of environmentalism\nBrennilis Nuclear Power Plant\nPlogoff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBorvon, Gérard (2004).

        "content": "Osborne House, formerly Cheadle Town Hall, is a former municipal building in Leek Road in Cheadle, Staffordshire, a town in England. The building retains the façade of the former town hall but has been extensively redeveloped for residential use behind the façade.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the status of the Cheadle as a market town, a rural sanitary district was established in 1872. It was administered from the Cheadle Union Workhouse on Bank Street. In 1894, the rural sanitary district was succeeded by Cheadle Rural District Council. In anticipation of the change, and in the context of the need for a public events venue, civic leaders decided to commission a town hall. The site they selected was open land on the west side of Leek Road.The building was designed in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick and was officially opened by Lady Manningham Buller, whose seat was at Dilhorne Hall, on 5 November 1894. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto Leek Road. The first bay on the left was fenestrated by a prominent bay window which was projected forward, with a mullioned and transomed window on the first floor. The third bay on the left originally contained an ornate portico containing an elliptically headed doorway with an archivolt flanked by hexagonal columns with castellated finials. The right-hand bay was fenestrated on the ground floor by a mullioned window surmounted by a pediment; there was another mullioned window on the first floor. The other bays were fenestrated by mullioned windows on both floors. The first and third bays were surmounted by stepped gables.The newly formed parish council held its first meeting in the town hall around in late 1894. The Girls' Friendly Society and the local masonic lodge also met in the town hall. In March 1915, the town hall was acquired by the Osborne Theatre Company which converted into a cinema known as the Osborne Cinema. It also operated as a venue for concerts and other public events. Meanwhile, the rural district council established its own council offices further north along Leek Road, on the opposite side, in 1937.The building continued to serve as a cinema and concert hall until the early 1970s,  when it was converted into a nightclub, initially known initially as Ossies and later as Whispers, but that also closed in 1987. In March 1990, the building was severely damaged by arson.  A proposal to restore the building as a heritage centre was unsuccessful, as was an attempt to get the building listed.  In 1995, the main part of the building was demolished and replaced by a retirement complex of 15 flats.  Much of the facade of the town hall was retained in the new development, which was named Osborne House to recall the name of the former cinema. As part of the redevelopment the portico was dismantled and the front of it was embedded into the right hand bay.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Diego Ros de Medrano (Alcalá de Henares, Madrid c. 1639 – Ourense, 24, March 1694) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as bishop of Ourense, governor captain general of the Kingdom of Galicia, a Doctor of Theology, and a professor at the Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso. He served as a bishop in the diocese of Ourense for 20.5 years.\nBishop Diego Ros de Medrano's portrait is the work of Manuel de Lara in 1714 in Málaga. The bishop is represented in a half-length portrait, under a canopy or banner, holding a book and a governors baton. He wears a cassock and a mozzetta and is wearing a biretta. To his right, a crucifix is depicted. The portrait is surrounded by a crowded border composed of angels, who carry the attributes of Don Diego Ros de Medrano, such as the bishops mitre or the crozier. At the top, and in the center, his coat of arms. Diego's coat of arms also appears in stone on the façade of the chapel he built in Ourense Cathedral, however it additionally shows a tower in the middle, 8 crosses of San Andres around the border, crowned with a hat.\n\n\n== Family ==\nA member of the noble House of Medrano in Soria— Diego was the son of Antonio Ros de Medrano, born in Ágreda, and Ana de Torres, from Alcalá. Future descendants of his family, notably Manuel Ros de Medrano (b. Orense, 12 September 1756 - d. 23 September 1821), became Bishop of the Diocese of Tortosa.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Right Reverend Bishop Diego Ros de Medrano studied at the university of his hometown, as a scholarship student at the Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso; there he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in Arts, and he obtained a bachelor's and doctoral degree in Theology.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe first part of Medrano's teaching career took place at the Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso between 1658 and 1665, as a professor of Prima de Escoto and Prima de Sagrada Escritura, lecturer of Vespers, in the minor of Santo Tomás and in Natural Philosophy; the second part, as a lecturer of Prima de Santo Tomás, was from 1665 to 1673.\n\n\n=== Ecclesiastical career ===\nHis ecclesiastical career developed in parallel, as he was ordained a priest around 1650-1653 and was parish priest of San Nicolás in Madrid for more than three years, later becoming a master canon at the collegiate church of Santos Justo y Pastor, in Alcalá.\n\n\n=== Queen Mariana de Austria and Pope Clement X: Medrano's appointment to the Episcopal Government of Ourense ===\nVacant due to the promotion of Friar Baltasar de los Reyes to the diocese of Coria, Diego Ros de Medrano was presented to Pope Clement X by Mariana de Austria, with Nithard as ambassador in Rome (March 18, 1673), to assume the episcopal government of Ourense \"without more diligence or favor than the splendor of his merit.\"\n\n\n=== Bishop of Ourense ===\n\nOn 29 May 1673, Medrano was appointed to the Diocese of Ourense and on 13 September 1673 he was ordained a Bishop in the Church of Alcalá de Henares and consecrated by Bishop Miguel Peréz de Cevallos. He succeeded the previous Bishop of Ourense, Baltasar de los Reyes. Diego Ros de Medrano took charge of that diocese, which he would not abandon despite being tempted with more than one promotion —apparently, he renounced the mitres of León, Plasencia, and Santiago—, remaining in charge of a diocese poor in income, small, markedly rural (the capital had a few hundred inhabitants) and very problematic because it was divided into 651 parishes and had less clergy than other Galician dioceses.\nBishop Medrano only had the rights of presentation to seventy parishes while the nobility and the monasteries controlled 581. His lordship power was scarce in contrast to the other lordships —houses of Monterrey and Ribadavia. However it is not in vain that in Medrano's Ourense there were six of the most populous and important Cistercian and Benedictine monasteries in Galicia: Oseira and Celanova.\nAll this resulted in a lack of control over the clergy and the faithful, and that is why Diego Ros de Medrano distinguished himself during his tenure for the staunch defense of the rights of the episcopal mitre, especially its jurisdictional capacity, for which he himself made efforts to study Law and Sacred Canons, even personally presiding over the archiepiscopal hearings for years.\nBishop Diego Ros de Medrano appointed Don Biento Trelles as a perpetual regidor.\n\n\n=== Visitor of the Royal Chancery of Valladolid and Governor Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia (1686) ===\n\"As all of Spain recognized his courage and great understanding, His Majesty chose him, like Gideon, as Governor of this Kingdom, hoping for its restoration under his governance.\"\nThere is no doubt that Don Diego Ros de Medrano had the support of Charles II of Spain, since, breaking with the custom of appointing the archbishops of Santiago as governors of the Kingdom of Galicia in case of substitution or interim, and being bishop of a smaller diocese, Diego Ros de Medrano was appointed visitor of the Royal Chancery of Valladolid \"at a time when very serious cases and very difficult circumstances occurred in it,\" and Governor Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia (October 9, 1686) replacing the Duke of Uceda, who had been given permission to move to the Court.\nThe Kingdom of Galicia was administered within the Crown of Castile (1490–1715) and later the Crown of Spain (1715–1833) by an Audiencia Real directed by a Governor which also held the office of Captain General and President. Don Diego Ros de Medrano also attended the assemblies of the Junta in Galicia, because  the King never consented on the petition of the Junta assembly in Galicia to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly could only take place when in presence of a representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the Governor-Captain General of the Kingdom, in an attempt to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements.\n\n\n=== Construction of the chapel of the Holy Christ of the cathedral ===\n\nA notable accomplishment of the Bishop was the construction of a magnificent new chapel of the Holy Christ of the cathedral of Ourense intended for a Crucifixion figure (La Imagen de Cristo en Ourense). Due to the chapel's limited size and the inability to display the Christ image with the reverence it warranted, Don Diego Ros de Medrano, during his tenure as bishop of Ourense, decided in 1674 to extend the chapel to ensure it could rightfully serve as a true sanctuary.\n\n\n== Executive Lawsuit ==\nIn 1686 Diego Ros de Medrano, who held positions as a canon, filed an executive lawsuit against the estate and heirs of Antonio Ros de Medrano. The lawsuit stemmed from a debt totaling 120,941 maravedis, along with 37 fanegas and 7 celemines of wheat. This debt originated from discrepancies in the currency and grain accounts during the stewardships of the Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso, which were managed by Antonio Ros de Medrano and his brother, Juan Ros de Medrano.\n\n\n== Death and burial ==\nDiego Ros de Medrano's death occurred in his see on 24, March 1694 and he was buried in the chapel of the Holy Christ of the cathedral of Ourense, which he himself had enlarged. A laudatory \"Posthumous Acclamation\" (1714) accounted for his merits, the condition of governor distinguishes him from the usual in episcopal careers of the time. Doctor Don Juan Gomez de Escobar, Canon of the Holy Church, Provider and Vicar General of this Archbishopric, etc. granted permission for the printing of Diego's Funeral Sermon, \"as it is worthy of being put to press, and so that the virtue and venerable examples of the Most Excellent Lord Don Diego Ros de Medrano, Bishop of Ourense, may be remembered,\" on 24, November 1714.\nA Panegyric was written for the Bishop:\n\n\"Posthumous Acclamation. Immortal fame. Panegyric trumpet of virtues. Funereal trumpet of examples, and of disillusionments, with which the Most Illustrious Chapter of the Holy Cathedral Church of the city of Orense publicly announced to the world the loss of the most famous hero ... D.D. Diego Ros de Medrano ... The mournful panegyric of such loss was pronounced last year of 94.\" - by Dr. Jacinto Andres Phelipes (Granada, 1714)In the city of Granada, on the twenty-fifth day of the month of January of the year 1714, His Most Illustrious Lordship, Don Juan Miguelez de Mendaña, Official of the Council of His Majesty, Bishop of the Holy Church of the City of Tortosa, President of the Royal Chancery, in view of the Approval of Father Fr. Gabriel de Zieza of the Order of Saint Dominic in his Convent of  Tortosa, granted permission for the printing of the sermon preached by Doctor Don Jacinto Andrés Phelipes, Master Canon of the Holy Church of Ourense, at the Funeral of the Most Excellent Lord Don Diego Ros de Medrano.\nPart of Bishop Don Diego Ros de Medrano's funeral sermon reads: \n\n\"To the Illustrious and Most Excellent Lord D. DIEGO ROS DE MEDRANO, most deserving Prelate of this Holy Church, who will always be mourned for his absence, accompanying the entire Kingdom of Galicia, which rightly still laments having enjoyed his governance and generalship. Deciphering my attention to that favored by God, and forever illustrious Leader of Israel Moses: consider his Life and Death. His first cradle was the waters, as you already know, and for this reason he is called Moses: \"Because I drew him out of the water.\" And the favors that as a child he has garnered! As an adult, he was already tending a flock when God called him from that mysterious bush, for greater duties. Our Most Excellent Prelate Diego Ros de Medrano was born in the town of Alcalà, to which an ancient river gives renown, and besides that, Heaven decreed that his cradle be the waters.\nCelestial Dew in the Cradle, which foretells, but would it not be a peaceful life, a rain of crystal-clear waters for the remedy of faults? His Nobility, the illustriousness of his Surnames attest to it. When he was a child, he enjoyed the favors of all, both for the greatness of his intellect and for his gentleness. Having completed the course of his studies with the common applause of all, and having graduated as a Doctor ahead of many, he went to the Crowned City of Madrid to serve at the Parish of San Nicolás. There he tended, like another Moses, the Flock of Christ.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA street was named after the Bishop in Alcalá de Henares called \"Calle Diego Ros y Medrano\" in the Community of Madrid, Spain.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Hawkeyes, led by second-year head coach Lisa Bluder, played their home games in Iowa City, Iowa, at Carver–Hawkeye Arena. They finished the season 18–11 overall, 10–6 in Big Ten play, to occupy fourth place in the conference regular season standings. The team was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament, but received an at-large bid to the women's NCAA basketball tournament. After an opening round win over Virginia, the Hawkeyes were dominated by No. 1 and eventual national champion Connecticut.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== Rankings ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tap on the Tutt is a historic pub in Boroughbridge, a town in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe pub was commissioned by Hepworth & Co, a brewer based in Ripon, for a site on the Great North Road.  It was designed by Sydney Blenkhorn and opened in 1930.  A rear extension was added in about 1950, but the building remained largely unchanged under long-term owners.  In 2001, it was grade II listed on the initiative of the Campaign for Real Ale.  It also appears on the organisation's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors, with the maximum three stars.\nThe pub was sold in 2003 and it was considered for conversion into a restaurant, but ultimately remained a pub.  It was known for many years as the Three Horseshoes, but became the \"Tap on the Tutt\" in 2023.\nThe two-storey building is in painted render with applied timber framing, and has a tile roof.  The ground floor has four public rooms, arranged in a line: a dining room, public bar, lounge, and a second dining room.  A further bay, recessed on the right, contains toilets.  There is a servery behind, and a kitchen and service rooms at the rear.  On the front are two doorways with triangular canopies, and four canted bay windows.  The upper floor contains two-light casement windows, and in the roof are six flat-roofed dormers.\nInside the pub, most of the original fittings survive, other than fitted seating and the enlargement of openings between some of the rooms.  They include the oak bar counter in the lounge, with a glazed screen above, bar back and fireplace surround, all in oak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Boroughbridge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The books are organised chronologically and cover Palestinian history from 1799 to 2001. Laurens breaks down Palestinian and broader Middle Eastern history into time periods that can span months, weeks or days, analyzing them as brief eras with distinct themes.\nThe title is derived from a terminology that has been used since 1815, and more specifically refers to a speech by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, who said that the greatest achievement of Zionism was that it replaced the Jewish question with \"the question of Palestine\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFayard: Tome 1 Tome 2 Tome 3 Tome 4 Tome 5",

        "content": "ANNO: X is a compilation album of official anime songs sung by Rodrigo Rossi released in 2019. Nearly all songs had the Portuguese lyrics written by Rossi himself (all but Pegasus Fantasy and Soldier Dream), who also produced and mixed the album.\nIt was released ten years after the singer's first time singing an anime song officially, hence the title. He started in 2010 with the Brazilian Portuguese version of the opening of Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas.\nThere are 15 tracks, several with other musicians' participation, such as his Danger3's colleagues Larissa Tassi and Ricardo Cruz; Junior Hagemeyer from Projeto Remake; Davis Ramay; Cesário Filho, Sidney Sohn Jr.; Ovídio Cleto and Wendel Bezerra.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",
