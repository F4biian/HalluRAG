He served as both the 10th president of the Spanish Football Federation between 1940 and 1941, and the 12th president of the National Committee of Referees from 1951 to 1952.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAntonio Bernabéu was born on 19 April 1890 in Almansa, where his family lived, as the son of Antonia de Yeste Núñez and the lawyer José Bernabéu Ibáñez, administrator of the properties of the Marquis of Villafuerte and the Countess of Montealegre.\nBetween 1909 and 1912, he was a student at the Collegio di Spagna a college for Spanish students at the University of Bologna, Italy. While there, he was one of the founders of Bologna FC, becoming its first-ever foreign player and leaving the team after graduating in law. During his three years there, Bernabéu made 13 appearances and 8 goals for the rossoblù. The data still available today gives him as the scorer of the fifth match in Bologna's history (1–4), which was played on 19 February 1911 against Verona. When he returned to Spain, he became manager of Real Madrid, where his younger brother Santiago was playing, going on to become the most important president in the club's history and to whom the stadium in the city is now named.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1926, Bernabéu was appointed as the 6th president of the Spanish Football Federation (replacing Julián Olave), a position that he held for one year until 1927, when he was replaced by Pedro Díez de Rivera.\nIn the 1936 Spanish general election, Bernabéu, a lawyer by profession, was elected deputy for the Albacete constituency for the CEDA party with 75,351 votes.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBernabéu died in Madrid in July 1967, at 77 years of age.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Madrid\n\nTerza Categoria:\nWinners: 1909–10\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio Baró was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for FC Espanya in the 1910s.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBorn in Catalonia, Baró began his career at his hometown club FC Espanya in the early-1910s, where he formed an attacking partnership with Gabriel Bau and Casimiro Mallorquí, and quickly became a key element of the team, going on to play with them for nearly a decade. He was one of the most important players in the team's rise to become a powerhouse in Catalonia, competing head-to-head against the likes of Barcelona and Espanyol, being crucial in helping the club win three Catalan championships (1912–13, 1913–14 and 1916–17) and the 1914 Pyrenees Cup, scoring once in the semifinals against FC Barcelona in an enventual 5–2 victory.\nBaró also scored once in the semifinals of the 1914 Copa del Rey against Sociedad Gimnástica, netting a late equalizer in the second leg to give Espanya a 2–1 aggregate win, thus contributing decisively in helping the club reach the final, which still is the club's only Copa del Rey final appearance, but they lost 1–2 to Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of a brace from Severino Zuazo.\n\n\n== International career ==\nLike many other FC Espanya players of that time, Baró played several matches for the Catalonia national team, being a member of the Catalan side that played in the first edition of the Prince of Asturias Cup in 1915, an inter-regional competition organized by the RFEF. At the tournament, he formed an attacking partnership with the forwards of FC Barcelona, Vicente Martínez, Enrique Peris, and Paulino Alcántara, the latter scoring the competition's first-ever goal against the Centro team (a Castile/Madrid XI) on 10 May, while Baró netted the winner in a 2–1 victory. In the end, however, Catalonia lost the title to the Basque Country.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nFC Espanya\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (3): 1912–13, 1913–14 and 1916–17\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1914\nPyrenees Cup:\nChampions (1): 1914\n\n\n=== International ===\nCatalonia\nPrince of Asturias Cup:\nRunner-up (1): 1915\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adolfo Bracero García (22 October 1909 – 30 August 1978) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid, and Sevilla FC. He is one of the few players who played for both Sevilla and Madrid. He later became a manager, taking charge over Real Jaén and Granada CF in the 1950s.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAdolfo Bracero was born on 22 October 1909 in Huelva, and began his footballing career at Sevilla FC in 1931, with whom he played for five years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. During his time at Seville, he helped his club win the 1935 Spanish Cup, starting in the final against Sabadell, which ended in a 3–0 victory.\nOnce the conflict was over, Bracero joined Club Aviación, the future Atlético Madrid, where he was a member of Athletic's historic 1939–40 season, in which the club won the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro and the 1939–40 La Liga under coach Ricardo Zamora; however, he did not play a major role in these triumphs since he only started two league matches during the season. He went on to join Real Madrid, where he again had few chances, playing only three matches for the whites. In total, he scored six goals in 19 league matches for Sevilla, Atlético, and Madrid. He then played for UD Salamanca and Recreativo de Huelva, where he retired in 1945.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nAfter his career as a player ended, Bracero remained linked to Recreativo de Huelva, now as a coach, which he oversaw between 1945 and 1947. Following a brief stint at the helm of CD Iliturgi in 1947–48 and a three-year hiatus, he took charge of Tercera División club Real Jaén in 1951, and in his first season at the club, Bracero guided them to promotion to the Segunda División as well as the 1951–52 Copa Federación de España, in which they defeated Orensana 3–1 in the final. The promotion match took place against UD Almería on 6 April 1952, and they won 3–0. In the following season, he guided the club to another promotion, this time to the first division, the club's first and only such season in its history.\nBracero went on to manage Granada CF (1953–54), CD San Fernando (1955–56), CD Badajoz (1956–60), UD Salamanca (1961–62), and again Recreativo de Huelva (1964–65). He played a few matches as a forward for San Fernando and Badajoz, at the ages of 46 and 48.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nSevilla\n\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1935\nAtlético Aviación\n\nLa Liga:\nChampions (1): 1939–40\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alberto Bosch y Fustegueras (26 December 1848 – 13 May 1900) was a Spanish engineer, lawyer, and politician, who served as a Mayor of Madrid twice, in 1885 and in 1891–92, and later as a Development Minister of Spain during the Regency of Maria Christina of Austria. He was also a Deputy of Spain for Roquetes, Tarragona, between 1881 and 1884, a Senator for the Economic Society of Madrid between 1886 and 1890, and then for life between 1891 and 1900.\nHe was a president of the Real Sociedad Económica Matritense de Amigos del País and of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and also worked as an assistant professor of Mathematical Physics at the Central University. He was the author of many and varied scientific productions, most notably Estudios trigonométricos, Manual de Astronomía popular, La agricultura española en el siglo XIX, and Geometría aplicada a las Artes.\n\n\n== Early and education ==\nAlberto Bosch was born in Tortosa on 26 December 1848, as the son of Miguel Bosch and Maria Antonia Fustegueras y Bagá. His father, a forestry engineer and surgeon at the same time, had a certain public profile in the former area, as a member of official organizations and author of technical works.\nBosch completed his secondary and university studies in Madrid, the city where the family lived for a long time, and accumulated up to three degrees, obtaining a doctorate in law and also graduating in Exact Sciences and civil engineering. As a result of the wide range of his degrees, he diversified his actions in his first years of professional activity, beginning careers in medicine and pharmacy. His political career only began in 1873, at the age of 25, when he joined the Conservative Party.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAs an engineer, Bosch was a member of the Roads, Canals, and Ports school and worked in the early 1870s on the topographic map prepared by the Geographic Institute. He maintained his assignment to said body in the following years, although in a supernumerary position.\nAs a lawyer, Bosch presided over the Legal Academy in Madrid in the 1876–77 academic year and was a professor at the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation. Although he barely worked, his participation can be cited in the report prepared in 1882 by a group of jurists for the Transatlantic Company, regarding the awarding of the mail steamer service to the Antilles. He was also a director of the Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Madrid.\nAs an academic, Bosch was closely linked to the Real Sociedad Económica Matritense de Amigos del País, and in 1875, he published in the context of its centenary, the work El Centenario: apuntes para la historia de la Sociedad Económica Matritense. Later he came to preside over it and obtained several elections to the Senate for the corporate seat belonging to the entity. On 23 March 1890 he entered the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences with the speech \"Applications of mathematics to moral and political sciences\", and he stayed there until his death 10 years later. As a mathematician, he also entered the University of Madrid as an assistant professor of Mathematical Physics. He published many and varied scientific productions, including Estudios trigonométricos (1875) at the university level and, with a more informative intention, Manual de Astronomía popular (1879) and Elementos de fisiología (1882).\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nBosch began his political career around 1873 when he joined the Conservative Party. He held his first parliamentary representation in 1878, when he premiered as a deputy for the district of Roquetes, Tarragona, within the Cortes of 1876–1879, the first of the Restoration. He repeated his seat in the elections of 1879 and 1881, and in 1886 he was appointed senator by the Economic Society of Madrid.\nA member of the Conservative Party of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, Bosch was in the sector headed by Francisco Romero Robledo. While he was Minister of the Interior, he was appointed general director of Penal Establishments (9 March 1880 to 12 February 1881), and as such he attended the International Penitentiary Conference held in Paris in November 1880, and wrote a technical memory upon his return. Upon taking office, he had to cease being a deputy; however, he was re-elected in the following year, in the elections of 1881, wherein a demonstration of his growing political strength, he obtained simultaneous election as deputy for Roquetas and as senator for the Economic Society of Madrid, and despite being in the opposition, he opted for the first of these representations. Always an active deputy, Bosch consolidated himself in the Cortes of 1881–1884 as one of the main assets of the so-called \"hussars\", the political sector headed by Romero. In 1883 he was appointed member of the official commission in charge of organizing Spanish participation in the International Colonial and Export Exhibition in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1884, Bosch married Elena Herreros Alvarruiz, and the couple had at least three children, María, Carlos, and Enrique Bosch Herreros. Herreros was a native of Tarazona and had properties in El Bonillo, Albacete, so in the 1884 elections, he obtained the position of deputy for the district of Albacete, which he held in the Cortes of 1884–1886. With Romero again in the Government, in January 1884 he was appointed undersecretary of the Ministry and took care of several specific missions, as delegate of the Government in Catalonia for the organization of the health service and interim general director of Charity and Health and also of Posts and Telegraphs. He was then mayor of Madrid from 3 April to 30 November 1885, a position in which he had to face the cholera epidemic of that year, more fortunately than his political boss Romero, who had to resign as minister due to his performance in the same circumstances.\nAt the end of 1885, after the death of Alfonso XII and the transfer of power from Cánovas to Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, Bosch followed Romero in his split from the party and in its political evolution in the following years. He was a director of the short-lived Liberal-Reformist Party between 1886 and 1888, and he then re-entered the conservative ranks in 1891. In the 1886 elections, his candidacy for Alcaraz, Albacete, was defeated, but he was able to obtain the Senate seat for the Economic Society of Madrid, which he exercised in the Cortes from 1886 to 1890, displaying enormous parliamentary activity.\nIn the 1891 elections, Bosch returned to Congress representing Roquetes again, repeating his 1884 feat of being elected as a deputy for Roquetas and senator for the Economic Society of Madrid, and he once again opted for the first of these positions, which in turn he left on 28 January 1892 to take up a life senatorship. In November 1891, and in the context of distancing between Francisco Silvela and Cánovas and rapprochement between him and Romero, he again held the mayor's office of Madrid between 26 November 1891 and 6 November 1892, while Romero held the Ultramar portfolio. Between 1891 and 1893, he wrote several letters addressed to Cánovas on various matters related to the mayor of Madrid, such as the opening of Velázquez Street and placement of the painter's statue, prohibition on the sale of cod, as well as other personal and political matters, such as the election of the deputy for Roquetas. With a delicate municipal situation and the hostility of the Silvela faction, his approval of the municipal budgets and an unpopular tax that caused street riots, such as the so-called mutiny of the greengrocers in July 1892, and triggered a relentless investigation of the municipality by the Minister of the Interior, Raimundo Fernández-Villaverde, until Bosch finally presented his resignation in November 1892 and Romero followed his lead, willing to support the former lieutenant of his hussars. Villaverde also proposed a prosecution for alleged irregularities, but the request to prosecute him did not prosper in the Senate. In the subsequent strong debates in Congress and the Senate, Bosch led a new challenge to the Government with harsh accusations against Villaverde, which precipitated the fall of the Conservative Government. \nIn 1895, in a new Government chaired by Cánovas and in a position of challenging the causes that had motivated the crisis of 1892, Romero took over the portfolio of Grace and Justice, while Bosch held his first and only portfolio, that of Development between 23 March and 14 December 1895. In the few months he held the office, he organized the State's civil engineering corps, secondary education, arts and crafts education, and promoted fish farming, among other actions. However, the issue of the City Council reappeared, in a new episode of the confrontation between Romero and Silvela, with the opening of a judicial process against councilors and contractors and a large citizen demonstration, sponsored by the Círculo de la Unión Mercantil. The involvement of people trusted by Bosch led him to resign, and he was once again followed by Romero, who also presented his own.\nIn 1897, Bosch distanced himself from Romero due to his position regarding the reforms in Cuba. After the murder of Cánovas in that same year and the reorganization of the different conservative factions, the separation became even greater, and Bosch then approached the group called the Santo Sepulcro. In March 1900, shortly before his death, he was appointed member of the Technical Board created at the initiative of the Social Reform Commission for the prevention of accidents at work.\nBosch continued his career in the Senate, first as a senator for the Economic Society of Madrid between 1886 and 1890, and then for life between 1891 and 1900.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis sister Josefa was married to the politician Carlos Martín Murga. His son, Enrique Bosch y Herrera, was also a deputy. He had several decorations, such as the Grand Cross of the Order of Naval Merit.\nDuring his second mayorship of Madrid, the Count of Romanones delivered an ignominious tirade to Bosch from his parliamentary seat in 1892, so much that the offended called for a duel, which was held on 10 July 1892 in Leganés. The combatants crossed two shots.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBosch died in Madrid on 13 May 1900, at the age 51, due to uremia, he was buried on his farm in El Bonillo.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nEstudios trigonométricos (\"Trigonometric Studies\") (1875)\nEl Centenario: apuntes para la historia de la Sociedad Económica Matritense (The centenary: notes for the history of the Matritense Economic Society) 1875\nManual de Astronomía popular (\"Manual of Popular Astronomy\") (1879)\nElementos de fisiología (\"Elements of Physiology\") (1882)\nLa agricultura española en el siglo XIX (\"Spanish Agriculture in the 19th Century\")\nGeometría aplicada a las Artes (\"Geometry Applied to the Arts\")\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAntón del Olmet, Luis; Torres Bernal, José de (1922).

        "content": "Bramhall was a mansion in Portland, Maine, United States. Completed in 1858, it was owned by John Bundy Brown, an industrialist. The mansion, which was designed by New York City architect Charles A. Alexander, stood behind today's 147–163 Western Promenade, near which he also built homes for his children. After Brown's death, the mansion, which was the largest residence in Portland, was demolished. The 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land bounded by Bowdoin Street, Pine Street, Vaughan Street and Western Promenade was sold parcel by parcel, and the present neighborhood was built. The area is now part of the Western Promenade Historic District.\nThe building, which had a conservatory on its southern side, was demolished in 1915.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Petrades railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομική Στάση Πετράδες, romanized: Sidirodromiki stasi Petrades) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Petrades, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located 1.3 kilometres (0.81 mi) south of the centre of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio. It is both one of the northernmost and the eastern most operational railway stations in Greece, close to both the Bulgarian and Turkish borders.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaagaç station and for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaağaç railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of €1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of €117 million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is housed in a 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Beside this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli–Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\nThe station has an adjacent bus stop, with limited services to Dikaia and Alexandroupoli Port.\n\n\n== Line layout ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia panduriformis, commonly known as Pindan poison, is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is endemic to north-western Australia. It is a glaucous herb with erect flower stems, glabrous, toothed, egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, bracteoles joined to form a large disc, and deep- or brownish-yellow flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia panduriformis is a glaucous herb with egg-shaped leaves, the narower end towards the base, up to 200 mm (7.9 in) long and 70 mm (2.8 in) wide with toothed edges. The flowers are borne on a flowering stem up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall with bracteoles joined to form a funnel-like disc up to 120 mm (4.7 in) wide, often split down one side. The sepals are more or less free from each other, the lower sepal broadly elliptic and 15–18 mm (0.59–0.71 in) long. The petals are 20–25 mm (0.79–0.98 in) long, covered with soft hairs on the outside and bearded inside and deep- or brownish-yellow, the wings up to 1 mm (0.039 in) wide. Flowering mainly occurs from April to September and the capsule is oval, containing a round seed 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) in diameter with a wings about 2 mm (0.079 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1868 by George Bentham in his Flora Australiensis, who gave it the name Velleia panduriformis from an unpublished description byAllan Cunningham. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd transferred the species to Goodenia as G. panduriformis in the journal PhytoKeys.\nThe specific epithet panduriformis means lute- or fiddle-shaped.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nPindan poison occurs in the Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Great Sandy Desert, Northern Kimberley and Victoria Bonaparte bioregions of northern Western Australia and in the east of the Northern Territory, where it grows in red sand in open shrubland and low woodland.\n\n\n== References ==",

Quiroga, in command of 260 soldiers from the 1st battalion of Carabineros de la Guardia, embarked on the corvette \"Libertad\" and the schooner \"Limeña\", left the port of Callao on September 4, 1835, arriving on the Bolivian coast 18 days later and disembarking his ship. troops in the bay of Mejillones, 16 leagues south of Cobija.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nAfter two days of marching through sandbanks and gorges, the Peruvian troops appeared in sight of the port garrison made up of 87 soldiers and militiamen and which also had a fort defended by 18 artillery pieces of various calibers. Quiroga ordered his men to advance as a guerrilla towards the Bolivian positions, ordering not to fire a shot until they reached 100 paces from the Bolivian positions, the left wing led by Sergeant Major Andrade and the right by Captain Salaverry (brother of the supreme chief). The restorers advanced to the ordered distance under the cannon and rifle fire directed at them by the defenders, subsequently holding a lively shootout for two hours in which the leader of the square, Colonel Gaspar Aramayo, a lieutenant and 9 soldiers were killed. another 8 wounded, their leader fallen and understanding the futility of continuing to resist, the garrison surrendered, sending the citizen-soldier Antonio Molina as a parliamentarian to communicate the surrender of the square after which the batteries, the port and the city fell into the power of the Peruvians who had 11 dead and 18 wounded during the action. According to the Peruvian historian Manuel Nemesio Vargas, Aramayo would not have defeated Quiroga alive.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eisenoides lonnbergi is a species of earthworm native to North America that bioaccumulates a high amount of lead in its body from soil it consumes. This is anomalous as lead is usually immobile in soil and doesn't bioaccumulates up trophic levels compared to the amount of bioaccumulation seen in E. lonnbergi the general rule is that lead concentration in plants and animals is usually lower than in the soil. This might be due to the low calcium and high acidity in the soils at the collection sites in the Maryland Patuxent Wildlife Refuge area where the worms lived.  External images [1] [2]  This species of earthworm is usually found in wetland sites such as bogs where they are recorded to be the only earthworms present, and seems to either have an affinity for highly acidic soils or an edaphic affinity or endemism towards highly acidic wet soils that lets it survive where no competition can occur against it. It is threatened by the invasive earthworms in areas that aren't as acidic. The loss of wetlands in the northeast is also an example of habitat loss affecting their range. Including the wetlands of Upstate New York. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eduard August Rübel (German: [ˈryːbl̩]; 18 July 1876 - 24 June 1960) was a Swiss American botanist, professor, genealogist and politician who served on the Cantonal Council of Zürich for one legislative period in 1926. Most notably Rübel has been the founder of the Rübel Geobotanical Research Institute as well as full professor at ETH Zurich. He is the grandfather of Alex Rübel, long-term president of Zürich Zoo.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRübel was born 18 July 1876 in Zürich, Switzerland, the youngest of five children, to August Rübel (1827–1892), a German-born American citizen originally from Elberfeld, and Brazilian-born Swiss Rosalie Däniker (1838–1896).\nHis father was a silk merchant who relocated to Switzerland in the 1850s and became a partner with Carl Abegg-Arter, once the richest Swiss citizen, forming Abegg & Co. His mother was born in Rio de Janeiro to Swiss parents. Through her marriage, she lost Swiss citizenship in 1858. Most of his family remained American citizens, however, Eduard August naturalized in Zürich in 1899.\nHe completed a doctorate at ETH Zurich.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1908, he married Anne Luise Blass (*1882), a daughter of H. Friedrich Blass (1848–1928), a merchant, and Anna Luise Blass (née Kitt). The Blass family was well-established in Zurich society and her father belonged to two city guilds. They had three children;\n\nRosalie Rübel (*1909)\nCécile Rübel (*1918)\nHans-Ulrich Martin Rübel (1919–2014), who married Sophia Dorothea von Schulthess-Rechberg, of nobility. His son is Alex Rübel (*1955) who would later serve as president of Zürich Zoo.\nRübel died on 24 June 1960 in Zürich aged 83.\n\n\n== References ==",

His name is derived by a combination of Hamby's father's first name (Dan) with his father's first business venture (Mystik Tape). He is a descendent of Darley Arabian.\nMystik Dan's dam Ma'am was bought by trainer Kenneth McPeek for the owners and he recommended the mating of Goldencents to her. The colt was foaled at his Magdalena Farm near Lexington. Goldencents, a two-time Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner, stands for $10,000 at Spendthrift Farm in Kentucky (2024).\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Old Town Hall is a former municipal building in St James's Street in Dunwich, a village in Suffolk, England. The building, which is currently operates as holiday accommodation, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first town hall in the town was a medieval structure which may have dated back to the time that King John visited the town and presented a charter in 1216. It may well have also served as the headquarters of the local merchant's guild. Following some coastal erosion, it was rebuilt on a new site in 1663. However, the town was devastated by coastal flooding in 1702: St Peters Church was so badly damaged that it had to be dismantled, and the town hall was destroyed.\nCivic leaders decided to re-erect the whole town, including the town hall, some 0.25 miles (0.40 km) inland to protect it from the continuing coastal erosion.  The new town hall was designed in the Tudor style, built using timber frame construction techniques and completed a few years later, probably about 1705. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of two bays facing onto St James's Street. The town archives were locked in an ancient iron chest, made in The Netherlands and kept in one of the rooms in the building.\nDunwich had a very small electorate and, as most of the town had disappeared under the sea, it was recognised by the UK Parliament as a rotten borough. Its right to elect members of parliament was removed by the Reform Act 1832, and its borough council, which met in the town hall, was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883. The assets of the corporation, including the town hall, were transferred to a specially formed entity, the Dunwich Town Trust, with the lord of the manor, Colonel St John Barne of Sotterley Manor, becoming the first chairman of the trust in 1889. The town hall was subsequently converted for residential use and currently operates as holiday accommodation.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building has a timber-framed core, with red brick external walls, with the facade being plastered, and a pantiled roof. It has two storeys and an attic, with two windows on each floor, and a single dormer window in the attic with wide bargeboards. The windows are in the Gothic style, with diamond lattice lights.  There is a two-storey extension to the right, linking it to the next house, with a 20th-century door. It was grade II listed in 1984.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Praggion railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομική Στάση Πραγγίον, romanized: Sidirodromiki stasi Praggion) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Praggion, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located southwest of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaagaç station and for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, resulted in the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entering Greece at Pythio, then re-entering Turkey at Edirne (Karaağaç railway station), re-entering Greece at Marasia, and finally entering Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad. This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of €1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of €117 million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is housed in a 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Besides this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt. Access to the station is via stairs from the street, which means the station is not disabled accessible. Next to the station is The Tavern, surviving local food which opens up to the station concourse.\n\n\n== Services ==\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli–Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\nThe station has an adjacent bus stop, with limited services to Dikaia and Alexandroupoli Port.\n\n\n== Line layout ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ayr Mountain is one of the largest mountains in Medina, about seven kilometers from the Prophet's Mosque, and was mentioned in the hadith of Muhammad as one of the borders of the city from the southern side. It is one of the two mountains referred to in what Muhammad said when he oversaw the city, \"O Allah, I make sacred what lies between these two mountains as Abraham made Mecca sacred, O Allah, bless them\". Ayr Mountain is considered an important landmark in Medina, as it represents the border of the city's campus from the southern side. As Muhammad made it a marker of the boundaries of this campus, in the two sahihs from the hadith of Ibrahim al-Taimi Muhammad said: \"That the city is between Ayr and Thawr\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe city's military governor, Fakhri Pasha, established buildings, castles, and structures on the mountain between 1336 and 1337 when Banu Hashim besieged the city. Fakhri Pasha used these buildings to store ammunition and install cannons, and their locations were known as cannon rackets or fire rackets. These buildings were built with stones similar to the style of the Uhud Mountain citadel in an irregular molasses stone pattern.\n\n\n== Location ==\nAyr Mountain is located in the southwestern region of Medina and east of Al-Aqiq Valley near Dhi al-Halifa and Ali's wells. It is 8 miles away from the Prophet's Mosque, with an average width of 700 meters and an altitude of about 955 meters above sea level. It extends from east to west and is a straight black mountain with a flat surface and no peak, the Jeddah-bound traveler will see it after passing the Quba Mosque on its left, and it is one of the borders of Medina on the southern side.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nIt was named Ayr to resemble the back of a donkey, stretching almost 2,000 meters in length. Ubaydullah Amin Kurdi commented in his book The Famous Mountains of Medina that Ayr Mountain can be called Ayer as well.\n\n\n== Said about Ayr Mountain ==\nLocated in the region of Medina and east of Al-Aqiq Valley near Dhi al-Halifa and Ali's wells, and one of its borders on the southern side. One of the mountains the Muhammad made it a marker of the boundaries of the city as well forbade hunting between the two mountains according to hadith. Above it is another mountain with the same name, which is called Ayr Outgoing and Ayr Incoming. In hadith of Muhammad: \"Uhud is in one of heaven's corners, and Ayr is in one of hell's corners\". In a narration by Ibn Majah: \"It is narrated that Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, and it is on a stream from the streams of Paradise, and Ayr is on a stream from the streams of Hell\".\nIn the book Antiquities of Medina by Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari, p.205: \"Ayr and Thawr are the names of two of the mountains of Medina, the first is a large, towering structure located south of the city, about two hours away by unhurried walking, and the second is a small red one located north of Uhud. They border the city's precincts to the south and north, I climbed to the top of Mount Ayr in one of the months of the year 1347 AH, and I found it to be a cool, flat area where the wind blows, even though the season was summer, so it is suitable for the establishment of sanatoriums on it\".\n\n\n== Ayr in the islamic narrative ==\n\n\n=== First ===\nAyr, in another narrative is not one of the mountains of Hell, and what was reported in this regard can be considered not authentic. Ibn Majah (3115) narrated from Muhammad ibn Ishaq on the authority of Abdullah ibn Makanif, who said: \"I heard Anas ibn Malik saying that Muhammad said that Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, and it is on a stream from the streams of Paradise, and Ayr is on a stream from the streams of Hell\". And that he considered it as a weak chain of narration, as Al-Busiri said that it is a weak chain of narration in his book The Bottle Lamp (3/ 218). Al-Albani said it is very week in his book Ad-Da'ifah (1820). Al-Tabarani narrated in Al-Kabir (6505) mentioned that it was narrated by Abd al-Majid, son of Abu Abs, son of Jabr, from his father, from his grandfather Muhammad, that he said: \"Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, it is at one of the gates of Paradise, and this is Ayr, who hates us and we hate it, and it is at one of the gates of the Hellfire\", which he also considered it to be a weak chain of narration.\nAl-Haythami said in his book Majma al-Zawa'id (4/ 13): \"In it, there is Abd al-Majid, son of Abu Abs, whom I know, and there are others whom I do not know\". Also Al-Albani in his book Ad-Da'ifah mark it as weak (1618). As for the first part of the hadith (Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it) it is agreed on its authenticity, narrated by Bukhari (2889) and Muslim (1365).\n\n\n=== Second ===\nAyr Mountain is within the boundaries of Madinah, as narrated by Bukhari (6755) and Muslim (1370). The sanctuary of Medina ends and the open space begins from outside the boundaries set by Muhammad, which are Mountains Ayr and Thawr. So based on that it can be considered that the mountains inside the city campus, so It is not permissible to hunt in them according to the doctrine of the majority of jurists.\n\n\n=== Third ===\nThere is no record of what has been reported that Muhammad forbade staying overnight in or around Ayr Mountain. As it is also acceptable the selling or buying of the land that surrounds the mountain, if the seller truly owns it. As for climbing and ascending it, there is no record of Muhammad forbidding it.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mountains in Saudi Arabia\nAl Romat Mountain\nJabal Thawr\nMount Uhud\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOttoman atop Ayr Mountain in Medina.\nAyr Mountain and Ottoman fortifications with a stunning aerial view in Medina.\nJourney into the heart of Ayr Mountain.",

        "content": "Wieża. Jasny dzień (English: Tower. A Bright Day) is a Polish drama film from 2017, directed by Jagoda Szelc, based on her original screenplay.\nThe film revolves around the clash between the traditionalist Mula and her sister Kaja, who compete for the right to raise Nina, Kaja's biological daughter. Szelc received awards for her directorial debut and screenplay at the Gdynia Film Festival and was honored with the Polityka Passport. Reviewers of the film repeatedly emphasized its references to the tradition of Polish Romanticism and the work of European filmmakers such as Lars von Trier and Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the occasion of Nina's First Communion, her parents, Mula and Michał, invite their family to their home in the Kłodzko Valley. Soon, Mula's siblings join them – her sister Kaja and brother Andrzej with his wife Anna and children. It turns out that Kaja is Nina's biological mother, who disappeared for several years after giving birth to the child, and Nina was raised by Mula, who also takes care of their sick mother. Mula, who is busy with various responsibilities, harbors resentment towards her sister and fears that her presence might disrupt her relationship with Nina. Upon the arrival of the guests, a series of irrational events unfolds – the sisters' mother regains her health, and Nina refuses to participate in her communion.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAnna Krotoska – Mula\nMałgorzata Szczerbowska – Kaja, Mula's sister\nAnna Zubrzycka – Ada, mother of Mula, Kaja and Andrzej\nDorota Łukasiewicz-Kwietniewska – Anna, Andrzej's wife\nRafał Kwietniewski – Andrzej, Mula's brother\nRafał Cieluch – Michał, Mula's husband\nLaila Hennessy – Nina\nIda Kwietniewska – Dusia, Anna and Andrzej's daughter\nIgor Kwietniewski – Igor, Anna and Andrzej's son\nArtur Krajewski – priest\nBogusława Sztencel – Miss Wanda\nMohammed Almughanni – refugee\nJędrzej Wielecki – pilgrim\nMiłosz Karbownik – pilgrim\nMikołaj Chroboczek – pilgrim\nMaciej Miszczak – pilgrim\nMonika Strzelczyk – woman\nHanna Misiak – woman\nJoanna Nowicka-Zagrajek – woman\nJoanna Łużny – woman\nArkadiusz Zagrajek – man\nAlicja Pachowicz – fair-haired girl\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe production of the film was managed by the Indeks Studio, established by the then rector of the Łódź Film School, Mariusz Grzegorzek. The creation of the studio aimed to assist future graduates of the school in making non-commercial, original debuts. One of the students of the Łódź Film School who benefited from this initiative was Jagoda Szelc. When creating her feature debut, Szelc intended Wieża. Jasny dzień to be a protest song against the destructive ambitions of humanity:On a micro scale, it tells the story of a family crisis, but on a macro scale, it's a story about the obsession with control: the daily pursuit, perceiving ambition as a positive value, and the belief that love can be owned. This set of features is something that stands in direct opposition to our nature; it's like a denial of the primal attitude of 'let it go'.For the film, Szelc planned to adopt a naturalistic style, so she decided to forgo professional actors: I wanted them to be people who were somewhat unknown but very credible. Therefore, in the lead roles, non-professional actors Anna Krotoska and Małgorzata Szczerbowska were cast, attracted by Szelc's working method. Krotoska described her participation in the film as the most beautiful work I've done so far.\nThe cinematography for Wieża. Jasny dzień was handled by Przemysław Brynkiewicz. The shooting period began on 23 May 2016, in the Kłodzko Valley. The total budget of the film was around 2.3 million PLN, with almost 1.5 million PLN covered by the Polish Film Institute. The film was completed in 2017 after editing by Anna Garncarczyk and was then entered into festival circulation. It was first presented at the Gdynia Film Festival on 19 September 2017. The theatrical premiere of Wieża. Jasny dzień took place on 23 March 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Cinematic attendance ===\nDomestic cinemas reported low audience attendance at screenings of the film. According to estimates by the Polish Film Institute, it was seen by just over 23,000 viewers.\n\n\n=== Critical reception in Poland ===\nThe film was generally well received by critics. Jakub Popielecki from the Filmweb portal argued that Szelc embarks on a tale about the human condition. The horror here is primarily the horror of existence, the tragedy of an uncomfortable sprawl in which humanity finds itself. Popielecki drew comparisons between Wieża. Jasny dzień and Lars von Trier's Antichrist as well as the cinema of Mariusz Grzegorzka. Łukasz Maciejewski claimed that Szelc's film would appeal to Maria Janion thanks to its constant references to Polish Romanticism, although he also noticed allusions to films by Yorgos Lanthimos and the ancient Greek myth of Medea. Grzegorz Fortuna Jr. in Kino magazine elaborated on a romantic interpretation, stating that Jagoda Szelc reaches into the vast closet of Slavic folklore and brings back the forgotten figure of the 'szeptucha', who is not a negative and hostile character, but an ambivalent and fleeting one. Fortuna also argued that in Wieża. Jasny dzień the apocalypse is not associated [...] with a revolt of machines, nuclear explosions, and ubiquitous radioactive dust, but with a return to shamanism; to something primitive, mysterious, pushed out of collective consciousness.\nPiotr Mirski in his review for Dwutygodnik considered Jagoda Szelc's film to be the antithesis of Krzysztof Skonieczny's Hardkor Disko: While 'Hardkor Disko' is merely a collage of bombastic slogans, clichés, and flashy gimmicks, 'Wieża. Jasny dzień' can serve as a model of young, radical artistic cinema. Jarosław Kowal from the Film.org.pl portal appreciated the maturity of Szelc's debut and argued that Wieża. Jasny dzień is a film on the border of many genres: Szelc transcends genres, on the border between the real world and metaphysics, but instead of fueling conflict, she simply observes their existence, and certainly does not anoint one as better than the other.\nŁukasz Adamski from wPolityce.pl pointed out the problematic message of Wieża. Jasny dzień: Not only stylistically is this cinema intended for a narrow audience, but its message is also very disturbing. In his opinion, the film suggests that contemporary, secularized Poles, faced with the absence of God, are left with dense forests and paying homage to another deity. According to Adrian Luzar from the Interia portal, Jagoda Szelc's film is characterized by a disordered, somewhat crippled style, colliding overly zealous, documentary realism with scenes reminiscent of Xavier Dolan's films.\n\n\n=== Critical reception abroad ===\nWieża. Jasny dzień also caught the attention of foreign critics. Sarah Ward from the British magazine Screen selected Jagoda Szelc's film as one of the ten female-directed works to watch in 2018. However, Neil Young from Hollywood Reporter gave a negative assessment of Wieża. Jasny dzień, stating that although there are glimmers of talent on various fronts in the film, ultimately it is a hollow rehash of well-worn stylistic tropes. Ben Sachs from Chicago Reader compared Szelc's debut to other female-directed works such as Lucrecia Martel's La Ciénaga (2001) and Alice Rohrwacher's The Wonders (2014), but noted that with Jagoda Szelc, there is a lack of humor and compassion that characterizes other films. Szelc's perspective is so pessimistic and dark that one often feels like it's a horror film, and the overwhelmingly eerie music and sound effects reinforce this association.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWieża.

        "content": "Kaiki Shōhō (開基勝宝) is an early form of Japanese currency that was issued in 760 (Tenpyō-hōji 4) during the Nara period. These coins were struck in a gold alloy, and have a circular square hole in the middle. Very few \"Kaiki Shoho\" coins were minted as they were possibly an early experiment. This has made surviving examples rare with only 32 known coins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\"Kaiki Shoho\" coins were issued in the fourth year of Tenpyō-hōji (760) during the reign of Emperor Junnin along with silver Taihei Genpō, and bronze Mannen Tsūhō coins. All three of these denominations are said to have characters written by scholar Kibi no Makibi. \"Kaiki Shoho\" in particular were minted on the order of Daijō-daijin Fujiwara no Nakamaro, who was leading the government at the time. They were fixed in value and had an exchange ratio of 1 gold Kaiki Shoho coin for 10 silver Taihei Genpō or 100 bronze Mannen Tsūhō coins.\nBased on historical sources and archaeological evidence, Kaiki Shoho were probably not widely distributed. These is no given evidence that Kaiki Shoho actually circulated as currency, and the coins may have acted as \"show money\". Anthropologist Neil Gordon Munro remarked that Kaiki Shoho was intended to be the \"pioneer of a gold currency\". He concluded however, that the country was too poor at the time to \"warrant such an experiment being carried out on a large scale.\"\nThese coins were eventually lost to history until 1794 (Kansei 6) when one piece was excavated from the ruins of Saidai-ji. It was then kept at Saidai-ji as a treasure until 1876 (Meiji 6) when it was offered to the emperor as he visited. As the coin passed into the Imperial family it eventually became a national treasure. It was noted in 1903 by \"The Japan Weekly Mail\" that this unique coin \"left only a host of conjectures\" on its origin. In 1937 (Showa 12) when 31 more coins were discovered by chance during land clearing for a residential area. All 32 coins are now kept as cultural artifacts which are managed by the Japanese government.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKaiki Shoho at the Tokyo National Museum",

The falls are surrounded by cliffs measuring 10–20 meters (33–66 ft), making it a popular destination for swimming and cliff jumping. The area has been subject to major safety concerns by locals due to the amount of incidents and accidents resulting in people being injured or killed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nGordon Falls is named after Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore. In 1864, Abner Reid McClelan, the MLA for Albert at the time, gave the falls its name to commemorate Gordon, then-Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, while he visited Elgin.\nGordon Falls, the nearby Gibson falls, as well as the gorge lying between them are popular cliff jumping and swimming destinations for young tourists, leading to the area becoming the subject of major safety concerns by locals, including firefighters from Elgin who have advised against cliff jumping. Safety concerns were made at both falls due to the frequency of incidents and accidents leading to injury or death. In 2008, environmental concerns were further brought up by locals when a nearby rock quarry began development by removing the top from the nearby Tucker Mountain for potential uranium mining operations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of waterfalls in Canada\nWaterfall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGanong, William Francis (1917). \"Article II\".

        "content": "Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans is a 2017 concept album, combining the music of every song on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with lyrics describing the plot of Star Wars. It was produced by Dan Amrich and Jude Kelley, under the name \"Palette-Swap Ninja\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nKelley and Amrich first met when they were in a band together in California. Their shared interest in video games led to a friendship which continued even after Kelley moved to Boston in 2007. At this point, they formed Palette-Swap Ninja, a long-distance musical collaboration originally dedicated to parody songs about video games. They soon realized that their most popular songs were those that had a narrative, and decided to make a concept album which would tell a complete story.\nAmrich's original idea was to combine the music from Tommy by The Who, with the plot of the documentary The King of Kong. In 2012, Amrich and his wife Katrin Auch visited Kelley in Boston. While the three were at lunch, Amrich confessed that he could not make the King of Kong/Tommy combination work, at which point Auch said that a successful project of that type would require components that were \"bigger (and) more universally beloved,\"\nlike Star Wars or Sgt. Pepper. By the end of the meal, Amrich and Kelley had devised several of the song titles.\nAmrich spent two years writing the lyrics, after which he and Kelley began the task of replicating the music; this primarily involved software, including Logic Pro, but also used some real instruments, including the same model of electric organ that featured in \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nAmrich and Kelley originally intended to release the album in December 2015, to coincide with the theatrical release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but felt that it was not ready; they similarly missed the December 2016 release of Rogue One. They finally released the album free online in May 2017, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars and the 50th anniversary of Sergeant Pepper, which coincidentally were less than a month apart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRolling Stone France commended the album as a \"surprisingly elegant mixture of two masterpieces\". Paste lauded it as \"meticulously planned\" and \"more perfect than it deserves to be.\" Consequence praised Amrich and Kelley for \"having told the film's story in order without futzing too much with each song's cadence and instrumentation.\"\nIo9 felt it was \"most impressive\" and \"really good\", and noted the inclusion of themes from John Williams' Star Wars music. Jason Kottke called it \"amazing\". Slate found its lyrics to be \"clever\", and observed that the music video begins with its own version of the opening crawl.\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nIn 2018, Amrich and Kelley — accompanied by the non-profit Awesöme Orchestra Collective —  gave a free live performance of the album at the University of California, Berkeley's Hertz Hall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPrincess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans (official download page)\nPlaylist of the Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans music videos, at YouTube\nThe Making of Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans at PaletteSwapNinja.com\nSpecial Episode 1: Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans, Amrich and Auch's podcast",

        "content": "Iranian Fiduciary Trust Fund Act of 1950 was authorized by the 81st United States Congress which established a trust fund for the education of Iranian naturalized persons in the United States. The one hundred and ten thousand dollars was governed as a trust fund and accrued by the United States from the Iranian government in four transaction installments occurring between December 24, 1924, and March 29, 1925.\nThe Act of Congress confirmed the trust fund in accordance with the Diplomatic and Consular Service Appropriations Act of 1896 as codified by 29 Stat. 32 entitled Trust Funds. The United States federal statute amended the Permanent Appropriations Repeal Act of 1934 providing an addendum to section twenty entitled Certain Funds Established as Trust Fund Accounts.\n\n\n== Origins of Iranian Educational Exchange Act ==\nTehran, capital of Persia (Iran), attested to periodic societal rivalries with the Baháʼí Faith during the 1920s of the Qajar dynasty and succession of the Pahlavi dynasty.\nA United States Foreign Service officer by the name of Robert Whitney Imbrie was serving in Iran on a temporary assignment representing the foreign relations of the United States. On July 18, 1924, Robert Imbrie toured the Grand Bazaar, Tehran where he was accosted by a social movement of contradictory skeptics of the Baháʼí orthodoxy as an interest group of Religion in Iran. The accentuating social exchange with the Persians ― Islam in Iran ― proved to be a fateful engagement for the United States foreign service officer in July 1924.\nKatherine Imbrie, wife of Robert Whitney Imbrie, judiciously appealed to the 69th United States Congress in 1926. The public plea was a expediency for an expenditure of funds advancing the education of Persian students in the United States.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAllen Dulles\nAnglo-Persian Agreement\nAnglo-Persian Oil Company\nIslamic extremism\nNationalization of the Iranian oil industry\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Archival documents of U.S. Department of State ==\n\"The Secretary of State to the Minister in Persia (Kornfeld)\".

At the moment of the incident, Fiorentina led 2–1 on the night and 4-1 on aggregate. Four days later at a UEFA emergency meeting, Fiorentina was kicked out of the UEFA Cup and the match was recorded as a 0–3 Grasshopper win. Future expulsion from European competition for Fiorentina was also considered by UEFA but eventually ruled out because of mitigating circumstances, specifically that the match, as part of an earlier punishment, was not played at Fiorentina's home stadium but in Salerno and credible evidence that the firecracker was likely thrown by fans of the local club Salernitana holding a grudge following a recent Serie A fixture between the two clubs.\nGrasshopper won 3–2 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== Third round =====\n\n3–3 on aggregate; Bordeaux won on away goals.\n\n\n=== Servette ===\n\n\n==== UEFA Cup ====\n\n\n===== Second qualifying round =====\n\nServette won 5–3 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== First round =====\n\n2–2 on aggregate; CSKA Sofia won on away goals.\n\n\n=== Zürich ===\n\n\n==== UEFA Cup ====\n\n\n===== Second qualifying round =====\n\nZürich won 6–3 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== First round =====\n\nZürich won 7–2 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== Second round =====\n\nZürich won 5–3 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== Third round =====\n\nRoma won 3–2 on aggregate.\n\n\n=== Lausanne-Sport ===\n\n\n==== Cup Winners' Cup ====\n\n\n===== Qualifying round =====\n\nLausanne-Sport won 7–2 on aggregate.\n\n\n===== First round =====\n\n3–3 on aggregate; Lazio won on away goals.\n\n\n=== Sion ===\n\n\n==== Intertoto Cup ====\n\n\n===== First round =====\n\nTPS 3–3 Sion on aggregate.

        "content": "Patmos (Bulgarian: Патмос) is a medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria rising over a promontory near the confluence of the rivers Arda and Borovitsa. A few kilometers to the west upstream the valley of the Arda are located the ruins of the fortress of Krivus.\n\n\n== Location ==\nPatmos is located on a hill over the mouth of the river Borovitsa and left bank of the Arda at the westernmost end of the modern Kardzhali Reservoir. The nearest villages are Borovitsa to the south and Doyrantsi to the north, belonging to the Ardino Municipality of Kardzhali Province. The hill dominates the surrounding lands providing visibility in all directions. Its slopes are vertical from the east and the south and steep from the west. The easiest access is from the north. The fortress is on a state-owned land and was declared a site of national importance is 1968.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPatmos consists of a citadel situated in the southernmost part of the hill, a suburb occupying the northern part of the elevation below the citadel, and another suburb on the western area below the hill. The entire complex and the adjacent suburbs span a territory of 100,000 m2. The citadel of Patmos measures about 115 m in direction north–south and a maximum width of 65 m in direction east–west. It has irregular shape, with the defensive walls following the configuration of the terrain, enclosing an area of about 6,300 m2. The walls enclose the hill from the west and north. It is built of treated stone, joined with white mortar.\nThe more easily accessible north wall is 1.25 m thick and is reinforced by two towers. The northeast tower is trapezoidal with external dimensions of 5.05x4.22x4.6 m and wall thickness of 0.85 m. It was accessible through an entrance with a width of 1.3 m, which was later walled up. The northwest tower of Patmos is an irregular horseshoe shape. It protrudes in front of the outer side of the wall at a distance of 3.9 m, and the thickness of its walls is 1.3 m. There is a square room in its interior, accessed through an entrance. The distance between the two towers is 12.7 m. After the northwest tower, the walls turn south, forming an arc that runs continuously until reaching the vertical sheer cliffs facing the river Arda to the south.\nWithin the citadel are the ruins of a large, three-nave, three-apsed church without a vestibule and with a length of 13 m and a width 11.5 m. It is built of treated stones, joined with white mortar. Its walls are partially located on the rock foundation of the hill and have a thickness of 0.75 m. The three naves of the church had separate entrances from the west, with a width of 1.35 m on the central nave and 1.15 m on the side ones. The floor of the building is the leveled rock foundation, partially covered with stone slabs. It was constructed in the 5th century with subsequent reconstructions in the 9th and the 12–14th centuries. The foundation of the church is assumed to the connected with the mission of Nicetas of Remesiana to spread Christianity among the local population.\nNorth of the church are the remains of a rectangular building with a length of 10.8 m and a width 4 m, built of rubble stone and joined with white mortar. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Bulgarian Fortresses.

        "content": "The Salford Star was a free local news, culture and campaigning magazine based in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. First published in 2006, it moved to online-only publication in 2009, although returned briefly to print in 2015–2016. It stopped publishing in 2021 for financial reasons.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe magazine was co-founded in May 2006 by journalists Steven Speed and Stephen Kingston, who had worked together re-launching a small community magazine, the Old Trafford News. Kingston had previously worked freelance for mainstream publications, including the Manchester Evening News, Elle, and The Times. He became frustrated that community articles were rarely accepted by publications, especially when critical of their sponsors; he experienced this particularly when attempting write about potential negative impacts of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on its host city of Manchester. Speed had previously photographed for community media, and was approached by Graham Cooper, a youth worker in a residential regeneration area, to help set up a local paper written by and for Salford people. They decided it would be a not-for-profit publication, and advertised a public meeting at a local pub. The initial meeting was attended by 40 people. The magazine received funding before its launch from UnLtd, Awards for All, and Salford City Council via the East Salford Community Committee.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Salford Star covered local news and culture in Salford. It also featured local history pieces, sports reporting, and ran interviews with celebrities from the area, including Christopher Eccleston, Shaun Ryder, and John Cooper Clarke. The \"What’s On\" section contained previews and reviews of local events and performances. The magazine was vocal on local issues and sometimes took an active role in campaigning.\n\n\n=== Campaigns and investigations ===\nFrom its inception, it reported critically on local regeneration schemes and published investigations into the property development company Urban Splash, which at the time was responsible for many such schemes in the area. In its first issue it reported on the Lowry Centre, a publicly funded arts venue which had opened six years earlier, promising to ensure it was welcoming to the community. It published a photo comic of an experiment in which a reporter photographed a group of young people as they entered the building, capturing how they were quickly ejected. According to Kingston, Salford City Council said they were “very angry” about the action, but did meet community contributors to talk about the issues.\nIn August 2009 it campaigned alongside the Tiles and Architectural Ceramics Society (TACS) and local residents to save the The Tree of Knowledge, an Alan Boyson mural at Salford University that was to be demolished, resulting in the work being protected with a grade II listed status.\n\n\n=== Recurring features ===\nThe Salford Star issued a satirical series of awards called the Mary Burns Awards (named after the local historical figure, Mary Burns). They were \"awarded\" every January to organisations and public figures for \"stupid statements, dodgy dealings and iffy activities\" during the previous year, and often featured critiques related to spending, transparency and unfulfilled promises by local public bodies and their private-sector partners. It also issued genuine awards for music and the arts, voted for by the readership.\n\n\n== Distribution and participation ==\n12,000 copies of the first edition were hand-delivered by local volunteers to houses in East Salford, and 3,000 more were left at community and social premises to be given out. Not enough copies of the second edition were available to meet demand, and by the third issue the print run was increased to 20,000. Over 100 volunteers worked for the magazine, including photographers, graphic designers and distributors.\n\n\n=== Community projects ===\nThe Salford Star ran a summer spin-off youth magazines, in which children aged eight to 14 participated in journalistic activities such as holding their own press conferences. These included community relations work with local young people and children of asylum seekers. The magazine also provided training courses in journalism, photography and graphics.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe publication was shortlisted for a Paul Foot Award in 2007 and was awarded as a runner-up. It had been longlisted for the same award in 2006 for its investigation into Urban Splash. In 2008 it won the Plain English Campaign's Plain English Award for Best Regional Newspaper and a How-Do award for North West Magazine of the Year.\n\n\n== Closure ==\nFacing a lack of funding, the publication campaigned publicly to raise money to keep running. Since its launch, it had been unable to access public funds, with Salford Council revising the criteria for Community Committees' funding of publications. In 2018 it raised £3,000 through various means including an auction of \"Salford relics\". Nigel Pivaro, a regular writer for the Salford Star, auctioned a brick from recently-demolished housing in Higher Broughton. Also for sale was a bolt from a Salford gasometer, advertised as having been made famous by Ewan MacColl in the song Dirty Old Town, but this was gifted to the singer's family in thanks for a donation made by his estate. However, the publication was only temporarily saved, and closed in 2021. Plans were made for the Salford Star to be archived by the British Library and the Working Class Movement Library.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Dean Hatcher Jr. (born October 22, 1940, in Madison, Tennessee) is an American structural geologist, known as one of the world's leading experts on the geology of the southern and central Appalachians.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHatcher attended high school at Springfield, Ohio's Northwestern High School, where he graduated in 1957. At Vanderbilt University, he graduated in 1961 with a B.A. (major in geology and chemistry, minor in mathematics) and in 1962 with a M.S. (major in geology, minor in chemistry). In 1965 he received a Ph.D. in structural geology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) with thesis supervised by George David Swingle (1922–1973). In 1965 Hatcher married Diana Simpson. After about one year as an employee of the Humble Oil and Refining Company (now merged into ExxonMobil), he was appointed an assistant professor at Clemson University. There he was promoted to full professor and taught geology and mineralogy from 1966 to 1979. He and his family in 1978 moved to Tallahassee, Florida, where he was appointed a professor of geology at Florida State University and in 1980 moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was a professor until 1988 at the University of South Carolina. In 1986 he returned to Tennessee, where he accepted a joint appointment at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as Distinguished Scientist and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences. In 2000 he terminated his position at ORNL but continued as professor at UTK until he retired as professor emeritus in 2018. From 1981 to 1988 Hatcher was the co-editor-in-chief, with William Andrew Thomas (1936–2022), of the Geological Society of America Bulletin.\nHatcher has been concerned about geological aspects of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear reactor safety. For disposal of radioactive waste, he served from 1984 to 1986 as science adviser to South Carolina governor Richard Riley. Hatcher served from 1990 to 1996 on the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Board on Radioactive Waste Management and from 1993 to 1996 on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission Federal Advisory Committee on reactor safety.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHatcher's research involves fieldwork more than theory. Most of his research is interdisciplinary, combining wide knowledge from the geosciences. The goal of much of his research is the better understand the evolution of continental crust, by means of studying mountain chains and mature crust. His research on structural geology has focused on \"large faults, mountain chains, formation and breakup of supercontinents, and neotectonics.\" He is the author or co-author of mmore than 200 scientific publications and the co-author or co-editor of several books. Although he has been mostly concerned with the Appalachians, he has several times visited the North American Cordillera in Canada and the US, the Caledonides in the U.K. and Scandinavia, the Alps, Morocco's High Atlas and Meseta, the Tatra Mountains, and the Southern Andes in Argentina. He has also done smaller amounts of fieldwork in China's Qinling (Qin Mountains), the Olkhon region in Siberia, the Mexican Cordillera, and several other regions.\nBeginning in the 1970s, he was a leader in the plate tectonic reassessment of the tectonics of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians using terrane analysis. The reassessment was motivated by the search for oil and gas caused by the oil crisis in the 1970s. With Jack E. Oliver, Sidney Kaufman (1908–2008), \nand other colleagues, he used COCORP seismic-reflection profiling to investigate a seismic transversal in the southern Appalachians. They discovered that the Blue Ridge Mountains formed a 200 km long tectonic blanket similar to that observed in the Alps. His geological map of the Appalachians was published in 1990 and replaced that of Harold Williams. With Harold Williams he wrote the important paper Suspect terranes and accretionary history of the Appalachian orogen published in 1982 in the journal Geology.\nFor many years, Hatcher wanted to do fieldwork related to earthquakes that do not occur on plate boundaries. In 2008 Hatcher was part of a group of geoscientists who received funding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to investigate the paleoseismology of the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone. This seismic zone is the second most active in the eastern USA — the New Madrid Seismic Zone being the most active. In 2012 he and his colleagues \"found a thrust fault east of Knoxville that displaced bedrock for about one meter over Quaternary river sediment.\"\nHe was instrumental in the planned Appalachian Deep Hole Project (ADCOH), which was proposed for deep drilling through the overthrust of the Blue Ridge Mountains into underlying sedimentary rocks. Although the project was eventually cancelled, preliminary work on the project brought important insights into the tectonics of the Appalachians and was published in a report.\nHatcher has been the leader or co-leader of more than 40 field trips for professional societies and meetings and is the author or co-author of numerous field trip guidebooks. He and his colleagues have done research on \"crustal-scale faults, large crystalline thrust sheets, lithotectonic terranes, geophysics, stratigraphy, and paleoseismicity.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn 1989 Hatcher was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is also a Fellow of the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the American Geosciences Institute (AGI). He was in 1993 the president of the GSA and in 1996 the president of the AGI. From the GSA, he received in 1988 the GSA Distinguished Service Award, in 2006 the Penrose Medal, and in 2020 the Florence Bascom Geologic Mapping Award. He received in 1997 from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) the I. C. White Award and in 2001 from the AAPG's Eastern Section the John T. Galey Award. The AGI awarded him in 2006 the Ian Campbell Medal and in 2014 the Marcus Milling Legendary Geoscientist Medal. Among other honors and awards, he was made in 1998 an honorary citizen of West Virginia by that state's governor (Cecil H. Underwood).\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nCook, Frederick A.; Albaugh, Dennis S.; Brown, Larry D.; Kaufman, Sidney; Oliver, Jack E.; Hatcher, Robert D.

        "content": "Duborg Castle (Danish: Duborg Slot, German: Duburg Schloss) sometimes also referred to as Flensborghus (German: Flensburghaus) was a fortification and castle in Flensburg, Schleswig during the Middle Ages and Early modern period.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere is uncertainty about the etymology of Dyborg. One theory suggest that it was named after a Danish knight called Jens Due, who lived in the 16th century. Another explenation is that a dove (Danish: due) may have been included in the castle's coat of arms and thereby given its name. In early history of the castle it was named Marienburg after the hill it was erected on, which beared the same name.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe castle was erected by Margaret I of Denmark and Eric of Pomerania, and would take five years to build, even continuing on parts of the fortifications after Margaret's death in 1412.\nBuilt as protection against the Holsteinians, Duborg would serve an advantageous location in relation to attacks from the west, while the harbor could be defended from the castle. This came evident in 1431 when Adolph VIII of Holstein initiated a siege on the castle, which would last six months. When Christian I of Denmark became Duke of Holstein in 1460 he would inherit the castle, which would continue to be under the Danish kings after the partitions of Schleswig.\nIn the 16th and 17th century Duborg would serve as center of the Danish royal power in Schleswig and would concurrently be a place of residence of Danish monarchs. Frederick III of Denmark would live in the castle during his father, Christian IV's death, and Christian V of Denmark would be born there in 1646.\nIn 1703 the castle would stop being a royal residence and from 1719 it would start being demolished. The demolished bricks would be reused in other places like Flensburghus. The last remnants of the castle would be blown up around 1900.\n\n\n== See also ==\nhaderslevhus – building in Haderslev Municipality, DenmarkPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nkoldinghus – Danish royal castlePages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nDano-Hanseatic War (1426–1435) – European armed trade conflict\nFlensburg – town in Schleswig-Holstein, GermanyPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Boyd Burfitt Williams (9 November 1882 – 30 November 1956) was an Australian pathologist and physician. She was the first pathologist at Lewisham Hospital in Sydney and later a physician in Macquarie Street.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Boyd Burfitt was born on 9 November 1882, daughter of Annie (née Fitzmaurice) and auctioneer and historian Charles Trimby Burfitt. She was one of seven children, of whom two brothers became doctors and the third a solicitor. She was educated at Rosebank College in Five Dock, matriculating in 1902. She completed a BA and BSc at the University of Sydney, before graduating with first class honours in Bachelor of Medicine in 1909 and a Master of Surgery from the same university in 1910. As part of her degree she studied pathology and, with fellow student Elsie Dalyell, wrote a paper which was presented at a medical conference in Victoria.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWilliams and Dalyell found employment at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in 1910. She was working as a pathologist at RPAH in 1912, being the first female senior resident there, and at Lewisham Hospital in 1914. Despite some resistance, she was appointed residency status at Crown Street Women's Hospital where she gained experience in obstetrics. She opened a general practice in Glebe in 1912 until 1924 when she moved into rooms in Macquarie Street. She maintained the role of honorary physician at Lewisham Hospital until 1938.\nWilliams was elected president of the University Catholic Women's Society in 1924, a year after it was inaugurated. She was an active member of the movement which led to the establishment of Sancta Sophia College, a residential college for Roman Catholic women at the University of Sydney in 1929. She sat on the Council of the college from its inception through to 1953.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nWilliams married fellow doctor Grosvenor Williams on 19 January 1921 at St James' Church in Glebe. Their three sons also became medical doctors and two were lecturers at the University of Sydney.\nShe died on 30 November 1956 at Bellevue Hill and is buried at Waverley Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

If no candidate had a majority of first-preference votes, all but the top two candidates were eliminated, and second-preference votes (but only those cast for those two candidates) were then counted in addition, to produce a winner. However, the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 directed that first-past-the-post would be used if there were only two candidates for a specific commissioner region.\nCommissioners have a set four-year term of office.

        "content": "Raajje TV is an television channel based in the Maldives, known for its news coverage, entertainment programs, and cultural content.\n\n\n== Arson Attack on Raajje TV ==\nOn October 7, 2013, the channel's television station in Queen of the Night building in Malé was targeted in an arson attack. The perpetrators reportedly used petrol bombs to set fire to the station's studios, causing significant damage to the building and equipment. There were no casualties reported.\nThe attack was widely condemned by local and international organizations as an assault on press freedom. Raajje TV, known for its critical coverage of the Maldivian government, had previously faced threats and intimidation due to its journalism. The attack sparked concerns about the safety of journalists and the state of media freedom in the Maldives. It was revealed in Al Jazeera's documentary Stealing Paradise that Ahmed Adeeb was involved in the attack.\nIn April 28, 2024, An anonymous individual on Instagram issued arson and death threats against RaajjeTV’s Senior Video Journalist, Laisa Ahmed, stating intentions to \"torch RaajjeTV\" and specifically targeting the journalist. The Maldives Police Service has initiated an investigation into the threats directed at media outlets, including RaajjeTV and Channel 13.\n\n\n== Raajje TV Ban ==\n\nIn 2018, Raajje TV faced a significant threat to its operations when the Maldivian government ordered its closure. The closure occurred amid a period of political turmoil in the Maldives, following the declaration of a state of emergency by then-President Abdulla Yameen. The government accused Raajje TV of violating broadcasting regulations and allegedly spreading false information.\nThe closure of Raajje TV was widely condemned by human rights organizations and press freedom advocates, who saw it as a blatant attack on freedom of expression and an attempt to silence dissenting voices in the country. Despite facing government pressure and intimidation, Raajje TV continued to operate through various challenges, including legal battles and financial constraints. \nHowever, with the change in government following the presidential elections in 2018, there was a shift in the political landscape of the Maldives. The new administration, under Then-President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, pledged to uphold media freedom and restore democratic institutions. As a result, Raajje TV was able to resume its operations and continue its role as an independent news outlet in the Maldives. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website in Dhivehi\nOfficial Website in English\nOfficial Facebook Page\nOfficial X\nOfficial Youtube Channel",

        "content": "Wetley Moor Common is a Staffordshire Wildlife Trust reserve consisting of ancient common land. It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its unimproved lowland heath habitat, which represents approximately 10% of the heathland in Staffordshire. Wetley Moor Common is 118 hectares or 292 acres in size.\n\n\n== Location ==\nWetley Moor Common is located within Staffordshire, England. It shares a boundary with the Northwest edge of the village of Werrington and is positioned between Werrington and Bagnall. The main access point to the Wetley Moor Common is a carpark entrance on Armshead Road, Werrington (ST9 0EL).\n\n\n== Management ==\nWetley Moor Common is jointly owned by the Staffordshire Moorlands District Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council, however it is managed by the Staffordshire Wildlife Trust. Due to Wetley Moor Commons SSSI status the habitat is monitored and managed. Management of the site includes mechanical scrub control and turf stripping. Gorse plants are also coppiced and heather seeds are scattered to bolster the heather population. Specially trained cattle are also utilized to help graze the habitat.\nThe site is monitored for its effectiveness as a carbon sink. Although in 2023 the habitat was found to be in a degraded state, it was recorded to store nearly 9000 tonnes of carbon which is believed will only improve with effective habitat restoration.\n\n\n== Wildlife and ecology ==\nThe grounds of Wetley Moor Common cover 118 hectares, however 70 hectares of that consist of unimproved lowland heath habitat. Around two thirds of Wetley Moor Common spans over coal measures and shale. This results in waterlogged peaty soil, which provides the right conditions for a rare wet heath habitat. On the Eastern side of the moor around one third lies on coarse-grained sandstone. This area consists of sandy free draining soil conditions, which provide conditions for dry heath habitat.\nWetley Moor Common contains plant species such as heather, purple moor grass, gorse, soft rush, bilberry and cotton grass. Sphagnum moss is also present on the site, with Wetley Moor Common being a significant carbon sink, despite the habitats degraded state. Wetley Moor Common also provides a suitable habitat for a variety of bird species including: reed bunting, linnet, meadow pipit, whitethroat and grasshopper warblers. Although a majority of the site consists of heathland, there are also areas of improved grassland and degraded marsh habitat. \n\n\n== History ==\nWetley Moor is an ancient area of common land, which is believed to have previously covered a much larger area. On the 1775 William Yates map Wetley Moor Common is shown to be much larger than it is now, consisting of around 5000 acres and extending to Bucknall, Caverswall, Cheddleton, Dilhorne and Weston Coyney.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rooke Chapel is a non-denominational chapel on the campus of Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. A gift of Robert Levi Rooke (1891–1994), the chapel is named in memory of Rooke's parents, Charles and Olive. Rooke announced the gift in 1963, at the 50th reunion of his class of 1913. It was inaugurated on October 25, 1964.\nThe main portion of the chapel includes the narthex, sanctuary, chancel area, organ chamber, choir rooms, and balconies which surround the sanctuary on three sides. The sanctuary can seat 850. Attached to the chapel is a one-story wing housing the Office of Religious Life, the Chaplain's office and a meditation space.\nRobert Rooke was a university trustee from 1930 to 1975. He died in 1994, aged 103. He was interred in Lewisburg Cemetery, located around 0.25 miles (0.40 km) north of the chapel.\nA quote, chosen by Rooke, on the chapel's exterior reads: \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" It is from Micah 6:8.\nA celebration of the chapel's 50th anniversary was held in October 2014.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The track reached number one in Dominican Republic. It debuted in the top 15 of the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and was certified gold in Spain. An accompanying music video, released simultaneously with the song, was directed by Stillz. It depicts Alejandro as a worker in another planet. One night, he turns off the energy of the entire city to concentrate it on an intense electric light that illuminates the sky, as if he made contact with an extraterrestrial ship.

        "content": "The Regni Ierosolimitani brevis hystoria ('Short History of the Kingdom of Jerusalem'), called Brevis historia for short, is an anonymous Latin history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from its founding until about 1193 with a short continuation by Jacopo Doria that brings the story down to the kingdom's fall in 1291. At Doria's request, a copy of the work was placed in the Republic of Genoa's archives in 1294. This copy survives, as does a 15th-century copy of it. There is an English translation based on the Latin edition of Luigi Tommaso Belgrano.\nThe author of the Brevis historia cites the Annals and the De liberatione civitatum orientis of Caffaro, to which he seems to regard his work as a supplement. Some of his material seems to be derived from William of Tyre and he shares details with the continuation of William known as the Lyon Eracles. Other material is unique and may come from oral sources, such as Genoese travellers to the Holy Land, or from reports or letters sent by Genoese in the Holy Land.\nThe early part of the history, as well as Doria's continuation, is concerned mainly with genealogies and marriages. The reigns of Amalric (1163–1174) and Baldwin IV (1174–1185) form the central part of the narrative and are more detailed. The original chronicle begins by describing how Godfrey of Bouillon \"was chosen as king and lord\" after the fall of Jerusalem in 1099. It ends by describing how Prince Bohemond III of Antioch inherited the County of Tripoli and passed it onto his son, Bohemond IV, in 1189. Then the continuator declares that \"[w]hat follows was not written in the book, but I, [J]acopo Doria, have briefly reproduced it in written form as I have discovered it from reliable sources.\" He ends his short continuation by noting how the claimants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem \"pointlessly hung on to just the title for the future\". A notary, Guglielmo de Caponibus, then records how the chronicle was placed in the archive in 1294.\nThe author of the Brevis historia is unknow. He may have been one of the Genoese involved in the aftermath of the Battle of Hattin (1187), in the expedition of Conrad of Montferrat or the Third Crusade. He has a high opinion of Count Raymond III of Tripoli and a low opinion of the Templar master Gerard de Ridefort. Alternatively, it has been suggested that he was Oberto Doria, Jacopo's brother.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBellomo, Elena (1999). \"La 'Regni Ierosolimitani brevis hystoria': note circa l'attribuzione e la prospettiva storica di un' 'anonima cronaca genovese'\".

        "content": "The first election to the Carnarvonshire County Council was held on 25 January 1889.  It was followed by the 1892 election. The county was divided into numerous single member wards with two councillors elected to represent some of the urban areas.\n\n\n== Overview of the result ==\n1889 was a landmark year in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. The outcome was very similar to that in Cardiganshire.\n\n\n== Unopposed Returns ==\nThere were some unopposed returns.\n\n\n== Contested Elections ==\nThere were a large number of contested elections and the majorities were small in most instances. In most cases there were contests between Liberal and Conservative candidates.\n\n\n== The New Council ==\nThe first meeting of the council was held in Caernarfon.\n\n\n== Summary of Results ==\nThis section summarises the detailed results which are noted in the following sections. This was the inaugural county election and therefore no comparison can be made with the previous elections. One councillor was described as an Independent candidate but was also grouped in some reports with the Conservatives.\nThis table summarises the result of the elections in all wards. 42 councillors were elected.\n\nThis table summarises the position following the election of aldermen. Eight were elected from among the elected members and eight from outside the council. This brought the total number of councillors and aldermen to 56.\n\nThis table summarises the position following the by-elections for the three seats vacated following the election of aldermen. Technically these were new seats, taking the total number of councillors to 56. However, the Liberals defended three seats.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Aberdaron and Rhiw (one seat) ===\n\n\n=== Abererch (one seats) ===\n\n\n=== Aberdovey District ===\n\n\n=== Bala District ===\nRichard Jones was a prominent figure in the public life of Bala, serving on many bodies.

        "content": "The Grand Hotel is a hotel in Locarno, Ticino, Switzerland, first opened in 1876.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Grand Hotel was opened in the Swiss resort town of Locarno in 1876, following the opening of the Gotthard Tunnel and the railway station in Locarno. It was built to a design by Francesco Galli. Until the hotel closed in 2005, it had a station on the Locarno-Madonna del Sasso funicular.\nFrom 5 to 16 October 1925, the hotel hosted the negotiations of the Locarno Treaties, that were intended to guarantee peace after the First World War.\nA new film festival in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland was planned, to counter the one begun in 1932 in Venice as being too closely related to the Fascist regime. In 1934 this took place in Lugano. In 1946 some trees needed to be cut down to create an open-air theatre in Lugano for the screen, but local opposition meant that the film festival was moved to the garden of the Grand Hotel in Locarno. After the last screening of the evening, parties would continue by the swimming pool late into the night. The screen was eight by seven metres, and there was seating for 1,200, subsequently increased to 1,500 and then 2,000. The hotel remained the location of the film festival until 1971, when it was moved to the Piazza Grande in the centre of town.\nIn 2005 the hotel closed. The furniture was sold, with exception of the gigantic Murano chandelier in the hall, long considered to be the biggest in Europe. Six restoration projects were proposed, without implementation. In 2022 the Artisa real estate group of Stefano and Alain Artioli commenced a comprehensive renovation, costing 100 million Euros. With the renovations, the hotel will become 5-star, with three restaurants. Reopening is due to occur in 2025.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe hotel was the subject of the short film Grand Hotel by Giulio Pettenò in 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

The campaign was later declared over by General Pietro Badoglio on 24 January 1932. Thanks to the help of the air force, during the battle the Italian soldiers defeated the tribes of Braasa and Dorsa and a unit of Savaris captured Omar al-Mukhtar, leader of the rebellion, on 9 September 1931. He was later brought to Soluch and executed here on 16 September. His aides, including Yousuf Burahil and Fadil Bu Umar, were also executed on 24 September 1932. Rodolfo Graziani stated that during the executions, 20,000 Bedouins were forced to assist the events to show that their aggression towards the Italian colonials was over.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWright, John (1983).

        "content": "The 1989 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1989 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1988–89 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Auburn Tigers and the Tennessee Lady Volunteers. The game was played on April 2, 1989, at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington. It was the first time an NCAA women's championship game featured a matchup between two teams from the same conference. After leading 35–27 at halftime, No. 1 Tennessee controlled the game throughout and defeated No. 2 Auburn 76–60 to capture the program's second NCAA national championship. Bridgette Gordon was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Auburn Tigers ===\n\nThe Tigers, who represented the Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, were led by head coach Joe Ciampi in his 9th season at the school. Auburn began the season ranked No. 3 in the AP Poll. After spending the first 14 polls at either No. 3 or No. 2, the Tigers peaked at No. 1 for two of the final three weeks before finishing the regular season back at No. 3 in both major polls.\nPlaying as the No. 1 seed in the Mideast region of the NCAA tournament, the Lady Tigers defeated Temple, No. 17 Clemson, and No. 9 Ole Miss to reach their second straight Final Four. In the National semifinals, Auburn avenged their loss in the prior season's National championship game by defeating No. 3 Louisiana Tech, 76–71. The 32–1 Tigers entered the matchup with No. 1 Tennessee as the slight underdog.\n\n\n=== Tennessee Lady Volunteers ===\n\nThe Lady Volunteers, who represented the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, were led by head coach Pat Summitt, in his 15th season as head coach at the school. After losing to eventual champion Louisiana Tech in the Final Four the prior season, Tennessee opened this season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll and spent the entirety of the season inside the top 3. After losing at Auburn during the regular season, Tennessee avenged the loss in the SEC championship game. They finished the regular season right back where they started – ranked No. 1 in both major polls.\nIn the NCAA tournament, Tennessee easily defeated La Salle, No. 15 Virginia, and No. 7 Long Beach State to reach the sixth NCAA Final Four in program history. They won 77–65 over No. 5 Maryland in the national semifinal to reach the all-SEC national championship game with a 34–2 record.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Georgia Alexander (1868–1928) was a nationally known educator and author and editor of public school text books. Her book series included: Child Classics (assisted by her sister, Grace Alexander); Alexander-Dewey Arithmetic (with John Dewey); and Graded Poetry (with Katherine Devereux Blake). For many years, she served as district superintendent of schools in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGeorgia Alexander was born in Indianapolis, 1868.\nAlexander attended the public schools, Indianapolis High School (now Shortridge High School), and was graduated from the Indianapolis Normal School. She later attended the University of Chicago and Harvard University, and received her M.A. degree at Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs a young woman, she was known as one of the foremost organists of Indianapolis, and at different times, was organist at the city's Christ Episcopal Church and the Episcopal Cathedral.\n\nAlexander's career as supervising principal extended more than 20 years. When the school system was changed, she became a district superintendent, serving in that capacity until her retirement in 1925.\nHer earliest published work was a compilation of poetry for school reading. She was also author of a set of readers and a speller which were used in the Indiana public schools ten years. The Child's Classics Readers, of which Georgia Alexander was author and in the preparation of which her sister, Grace Alexander, assisted, were awarded a five-year contract in 1914 by the Indianapolis school district. At Columbia University, she met Dr. John Dewey, professor psychology, with whom she collaborated in editing the Alexander-Dewey Arithmetic.\nShe was a member of the educational council of the National Education Association, an organization with a limited membership of 100 U.S. educators. She spoke before meetings of that body and lectured on educational matters in 15 states. She was also a member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, the Indianapolis Art Association, League of Women Voters, American Association of University Women, the Contemporary Club, and the Indiana Council of International Relations. Alexander served as a Director of the Woman's Franchise League of Indiana, which was affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nShe died in Indianapolis, November 21, 1928, in a private hotel which she owned and operated with her sister, Grace Alexander.

        "content": "The Coachmen at the Relay Station (Russian: Ямщики на подставе), also referred to as Coachmen on a stand, or an accidental game, is a 1787 one-act comic opera by Yevstigney Fomin with the libretto authored by N. A. Lvov, and was dedicated to friend of Lvov and folk song collector S. M. Mitrofanov, although it was specifically written on occasion of Catherine the Great's visit to Tambov. Although the scheduled visit never occurred, the opera was completed and performed without Catherine's appearance to resolve the plot as Fomin intended.\nThe work is hallmarked by Fomin's usage of the Russian folk song tradition known as the \"drawn out song\". It was premiered that same year on January 2 (November 8), 1787, although its location of premiere is dubious, performances having taken place in both Tambov and Saint Petersburg that year. The latter is considered to be the official place of premiere, however. On its premiere, however, the work was not popular with the audience and as a result, it fell out of performance.\nMuch of Mikhail Glinka's attempts and artistic recreation of Russian folk music practices originated with Fomin, while the nativist project known as, \"The Five\", specifically Alexander Borodin, continued the focus on authenticity and realism in the ways they attempted to incorporate the choral practices of Russian folk music into their work.\n\n\n== Roles ==\n\n\n== Musical structure ==\nThe opera itself has 15 scenes but ten musical numbers.\n\nOverture\nThe folk song  “Captain’s daughter, don’t go for a walk at midnight” is heard. This corresponds to song No. 16 in Nikolay Lvov and Johann Gottfried Pratsch's 1790 collection of folk songs, Collection of Russian Folk Songs with Their Tunes.\nChorus: \"Not at the priest's in the green garden...\"\nChorus: \"The falcon flies high\"\nAria: \"The zealous heart is valiant...\" (Timofey)\nDuet: \"Between us, coachmen...\" (Yanka and Timofey)\nTrio: \"If only I were a bird...\" (Vakhrush, Yanka, Courier)\nDuet with chorus: \"Should I buy them, Filyushka...\" (Yanka, Timofey, Chorus)\nQuartet with chorus: \"Molodka, regimental soldier...\"\nTrio with chorus: \"In the field the birch was raging...\" (Fadeevna, Timofey, Yanka)\nOrchestral march\nChorus: \"You all give up, give way, good people\"\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n1966: \"Russian music of XVII\" (Vladimir Yesipov, Melodiya)\n2006: \"Early Russian opera\" (Bomba Music)\n2020: Nuits Blanches – Opera Arias at the Court of Russia in the 18th Century (Karina Gauvin and Pacific Baroque Orchestra, ATM Classique)\n\n\n== See also ==\nRussian opera\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLibretto (in Russian, Russian Virtual Library)\nLibretto (in Russia, Operalib)\n\"Author in the opera “Coachmen on a Stand” by N.A.

Three Italian columns, commanded by General Salsa, moved towards the rebel camp of Ettangi with the precise aim of destroying it. The columns were made up of the following departments: the one on the right (General Cavaciocchi: 4 Alpine battalions, 2 Eritrean, 4 mountain batteries), on the left (General Mambretti: 4 infantry battalions, 2 mountain batteries and one field battery, another 3 infantry battalions in reserve); central, connecting the other two (Colonel Arista, with 2 infantry battalions and a company of Libyan askari).\nOn 19 June the Italian troops conquered the enemy outposts. The battle ended the following day with the capture of Sidi Garbàa and Ettangi. The enemy camp was found abandoned and before leaving it the Libyan guerrillas destroyed the powder magazines and the food stores.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "An Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon (French: Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon) is a posthumous work by Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre, analyzing and criticizing the philosophy of Francis Bacon. It was published in 1836 and translated into English by Richard Lebrun in 1998.\n\n\n== Thesis ==\nMaistre considers Bacon to be the fountainhead of a destructive rationalistic ideology, blaming him for much of the scientism and atheism of the Age of Enlightenment. The argumentation against Bacon's philosophy is based on Maistre's epistemology first enunciated in the St Petersburg Dialogues (1819), according to which science depends on the innate ideas that are common to all human minds. Without such first principles, Maistre argues, experiments would be useless because there would be no basis for judging their validity. Maistre also argues that genius plays a pivotal role in great scientific discoveries, as demonstrated by inspired intellects such as Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newton, contrary to Bacon's theory about conforming to a mechanistic method.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAlthough not as well known as some of Maistre's other works, its importance has long been recognized in France. Augustin Bonnetty remarked that \"it would perhaps be necessary to go back to Pascal's Lettres provinciales to find a more severe, more mocking, more pointed critique.\" Gustave Flaubert quoted a few sentences from the work in his novel Bouvard et Pécuchet (1881)—a critique of bourgeoisie society:\n\n“Bacon est absolument dépourvu de l’esprit d’analyse ; non seulement ne savait pas résoudre les questions, mais ne savait pas même les poser. // Bacon, absolutely destitute of the spirit of analysis, not only did not know how to resolve questions, but did not even know how to pose them.”\n“Bacon, man étranger à toutes les sciences et dont toutes les idées fondamentales étaient fausses. // Bacon, a man foreign to all sciences and whose fundamental ideas were false to the point of ridiculousness!”\nCharles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, one of the most distinguished literary critics in nineteenth-century France, thought that Maistre's chapters on final causes and on the union of religion and science contained \"certainly some of the finest pages that have ever been written in a human language.\"\nScholars have also claimed that Maistre's work anticipated the philosophy of modern science. According to Frederick Holdsworth, Maistre described for the first time many of the principles on which modern scientific method is based on such matters as the nature of causality, the inevitable human-centeredness of all scientific understanding, the role of intuition in scientific discovery, and the inescapability of metaphysical considerations. Larry Siedentop concluded that Maistre reached \"important and original conclusions about scientific method – conclusions which have since been accepted by the philosophy of science.\" Owen Bradley claims that \"Maistre's critique of Enlightenment notions of science is significant in its own right as a highly modern approach to the history of science.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He was descended from Alexandre Gendebien, who was Belgium's first Minister of Justice.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Hastière on 9 July 1939, he was the son of World War II pilot Marc Gendebien and Guillemette Carton de Wiart, who herself was the daughter of former Prime Minister Henry Carton de Wiart. He earned a Doctor of Laws in 1962 and a licentiate in economic sciences in 1964 from Saint-Louis University, Brussels and subsequently studied at the Catholic University of Louvain. After his studies, he became a researcher at the Center for Socio-Political Research and Information and was an assistant professor at the University of Kinshasa from 1965 to 1967. From 1968 to 1971, he directed the economic research office at the Province of Hainaut.\nIn response to the Leuven Affair, Gendebien left the Christian Social Party and joined the Walloon Rally (RW). In 1971, he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives and, in 1979, he was elected as a member of the European Parliament. However, he left the party in 1981 to join the Alliance démocratique wallonne and eventually settled with the Rassemblement Wallonie France, that he founded and became president in 1999.\nGendebien favored a split of Belgium similar to that of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and an integration of Wallonia and Brussels into France. He also denounced the \"Flemishization\" of the Belgian state by the armed forces and the National Railway Company.\nPaul-Henry Gendebien died in Liège on 3 May 2024 at the age of 84.\n\n\n== Books ==\nCongo, 1963 (1964)\nL’Intervention des Nations unies au Congo (1968)\nL’Environnement… un problème politique pour la Wallonie, pour l’Europe, pour le Monde (1972)\nUne certaine idée de la Wallonie (1987)\nSplendeurs de la Liberté (1999)\nLe Choix de la France (2002)\nLa Belgique : dernier quart-d'heure ?

        "content": "William Meade Fletcher (October 21, 1870 – December 19, 1943) was an American lawyer, professor and Virginia judge, perhaps best known as the author of Fletcher's Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations which continues to be revised decades after his death. Affiliated with the Byrd Organization, Fletcher served as member of the Virginia Corporation Commission (1928–1943).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in 1855 near Sperryville, Rappahannock County, Virginia to the former Catherine Meade and her farmer husband James William Fletcher (1827-1900), he was descended from the First Families of Virginia. He had a younger brother, James Hamilton Fletcher (1872–1948). In the 1850 census, his father owned 14 slaves, and 39 slaves a decade later.\nAfter the conflict, William M. Fletcher received an elementary education locally, then traveled to Charlottesville where he studied under Professor John B. Minor and received a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1891.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAdmitted to the bar in 1891, Fletcher first practiced law in Montana (1891–1894) before moving to Chicago, Illinois where he practiced mostly corporate law for nearly two decades beginning in 1895. Fletcher also became a professor of law at what was then the John Marshall Law School (1899–1901) and then at Northwestern University (1901–1904). Between 1905 and 1912, Fletcher taught at law schools in Philadelphia and Chicago, before returning to Rappahannock County and remarrying. \nFletcher wrote several major legal treatises, as seen below, some multi-volume. His first legal publication was about corporate franchises (published by Keefe Davidson Company in 1900), then two years later Fletcher published one on equity pleading and practice, and in 1910 another concerning the incorporation and management of corporations. Although he published another book on equity in 1912, Fletcher's great work was the initially nine volume 'Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations', beginning in 1917. Renamed 'Fletcher's Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations', it remains in print today through Thomson Reuters which acquired West Legal Publishing. Fletcher's co-author or editor was Basil Jones (1874-1939), a fellow University of Virginia graduate and lawyer who became an editor with Callaghan and Company in Chicago and would be buried there at Rosehill Cemetery. Jones's father, C.S.A. Major Horace Jones (1835-1905), had served as Charlottesville's mayor and his widow (Basil's mother) Susan Johnson Duke (1835-1922), regaled her grandchildren in Chicago about prewar Oak Hill plantation in Virginia and chose to be buried there.\nFletcher and fellow Rappahannock County native Wade Hampton Massey Sr. (1869–1944) of historic Meadow Grove Farm were close friends as well as political allies of Virginia Governor then U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. (1887–1966), who also traced his lineage to the First Families of Virginia\nIn 1893 Fletcher served as special judge of the Cascade County District Court in Montana. Three decades later, in 1925, Virginia legislators elected him as Judge of the Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations for Rappahannock County, but he only served for a year. In 1926, Governor Byrd appointed Fletcher to a Commission to Suggest Amendments to the Constitution of Virginia. The following year, Virginia legislators appointed Fletcher as a member of the Virginia Corporation Commission. He took  that judicial and regulatory office on February 1, 1928, and served until his death, with several terms as the rotating chairman. Fletcher also served as a Virginia delegate to the Delaware Democratic National Convention in 1932.\nBy 1914 Fletcher lived at a nearby historic house named 'Erin' while rehabilitating 'Thornton Hill', the family farm in Rappahannock County. Its earliest part had been constructed in 1790 for John Thornton, whose wife was a niece of George Washington (Francis Thornton had patented the acreage in 1720). In 1936 Fletcher cooperated with a historic inventory by the Works Project Administration.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nTaxation of Franchises (1900)\nTreatise on Equity, Pleading and Practice (1902)\nCorporation Forms and Precedents (1913), 2nd Ed. 1928\nTreatise on Incorporation and Management of Corporations in Illinois (1910)\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (1917-1920)\nSupplement to Corporation Forms and Precedents (1923)\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corptoations (1917-1920)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFletcher married twice. In 1896 he married Florence Lea of Philadelphia (1868–1911), who bore William Meade Fletcher II (1897-1978) who became a lawyer. After her death, Fletcher moved back to Virginia. In 1914 he remarried, to the former Martha Ball Buckner (1888–1996), who could trace her descent from Charles Washington, Lawrence Washington's brother and whose daughter had lived at Thornton Hill shortly after its construction. They had a daughter, Anne Buckner Fletcher Smith (1915–1942), and a son, James William Fletcher (1918–1998).\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nFletcher moved to Richmond after his judicial appointment, but often spent weekends at his Rappahannock estates. He suffered from diabetes in his later years, and died of a heart attack in Richmond on December 19, 1943, survived by his widow, daughter and two sons. As had been his father, he is buried in Rappahannock county at the former cemetery for St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Woodville, Virginia. Although the church itself was destroyed in 1929 and not rebuilt, the graveyard continues to be used by Trinity Episcopal Church in nearby Washington, Virginia. In 1952 his son would erect a kennel for a local foxhunting group.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brooklyn Queens Land Trust (BQLT) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation, preservation, and creation of community gardens in Brooklyn and Queens, New York.\n\n\n== Organization history ==\nIn the winter of 1998, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that 114 community gardens would be auctioned off in May 1999, claiming that the city would benefit from the land sale and the additional housing to be built on the real estate. After months of public protests and a lawsuit headed by a group of gardeners and State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the auction was stopped and a deal was negotiated for the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and the New York Restoration Project to purchase 112 of the gardens.\nOn March 21, 2004, the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust was chartered and incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization to manage 34 gardens, 29 in Brooklyn and 5 in Queens, with a plan to own those gardens. The Manhattan Land Trust and the Bronx Land Trust were chartered at the same time. Demetrice Mills was the first president of the organization, and in 2012, the TPL signed over the deeds of 32 gardens to the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust.\nIn 2016, the Trust collaborated with the Brooklyn Public Library on an oral history project featuring several garden founders.\n\n\n== Organizational structure ==\nThe Trust comprises a 15-member Board of Directors and has over 600 volunteer gardeners. They operate through a grassroots structure, with each Member Garden being operated by a group of gardeners, who elect one to two representatives who act on behalf of their garden, either by voting at meetings or serving on the board of directors.\n\n\n== Conservation work ==\nThe Brooklyn Queens Land Trust maintains its gardens in physical and legal ways, including providing liability insurance, managing property paperwork, connecting gardens to the city water system, and making physical repairs to gardens.\nIn 2016, the Trust received funding from the New York Community Trust to implement the Neighborhood Coalitions Project, which promoted sustainable growing practices and healthy eating through community development events. That same year, they also began the CIRCLE Initiative, with funding from the Land Trust Alliance, which conducted tree inventories and soil testing and implemented composting, rain harvesting, and beekeeping projects.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNeighborhood Coalitions Project\nCIRCLE Initiative",

        "content": "The politics of the United Kingdom in the 19th century describes the parliamentary-cabinet system of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, shaped in the 19th century by constitutional conventions.\nThe United Kingdom is a parliamentary monarchy. In this country, there is no conventionally understood written constitution to this day, in other words: a formal constitution, as is the case in other countries. Instead of one document, there are a number of norms called constitutional conventions, or the constitution in a material sense. The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty applies. The highest rank is held by statutes, which determine, among other things, the role of local government in society. In reality, the British government has freedom in shaping the structure and functioning of public administration bodies. The structure of local government was initiated by a series of statutes in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Political reforms ==\n\n\n=== Sources of constitutional law ===\nThe United Kingdom does not have a written constitution to this day. In the 19th century, sources of constitutional law in the United Kingdom included:\n\nPositive law, comprising fundamental legal acts such as the Magna Carta (1215), the Triennial Act (1641), the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), the Bill of Rights (1689), and the Act of Settlement (1701);\nCase law, concerning judicial decisions and covering the most important issues of constitutional law;\nConstitutional conventions, also known as unwritten law norms, which emerged as a result of the actions of non-judicial institutions in matters of the state's organization;\nLegal works, treaties, and legal textbooks.\n\n\n=== Legislative acts ===\n\nThe first law introducing significant political changes in the United Kingdom was the Reform Act passed on 4 June 1832, which aimed to expand political power to new social classes and establish new electoral districts (the reforms of Charles Grey). It introduced democratic and elective municipal councils; the second one, the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, reorganized the administration of poor relief. Rural parishes transferred care for the poorest to the supervision of newly created workhouses, which alongside the police became the most important local government function at that time. Another law, the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, reformed municipal self-governance, stipulating that authority in individual regions should belong to elected councils. This act allowed only men who paid municipal taxes for the benefit of the poor to vote for the new authorities.\nBetween 1867 and 1885, the extension of voting rights for men was introduced, laying the groundwork for mass political democracy in the UK. Among other laws, the Ballot Act (1872), the Corrupt Practices Act (1883), and the Redistribution Act (1885) were issued. Until 1894, several significant laws were introduced aimed at democratizing elections to local councils. This allowed for membership by election rather than the purchase of mandates. In 1894, the Local Government Act was passed, which divided counties into urban and rural districts. Subsequently, additional acts were enacted to streamline the functioning of local government bodies.\nThe United Kingdom evolved into a parliamentary monarchy with a parliamentary-cabinet system, often referred to as the mother of the parliamentary-cabinet system.\n\n\n=== From Charles Grey's reforms to William Gladstone's ===\n\nThe electoral system existing since 1832 was undemocratic, even though the reform led to the participation and political activity of the middle class in the country. The House of Commons consisted of two deputies from each county, elected through high property census-based elections. The second group in the House of Commons was composed of representatives of towns. Before the reform, the House had 658 members, with 122 representing counties, 432 representing urban districts, and the remaining four representing universities: Oxford and Cambridge. In response to pressure from social groups and the labor movement in the 19th century, electoral reforms were undertaken, leading to the introduction of universal suffrage and the democratization of the House of Commons.\nThe reforms by Charles Grey in 1832 took representation away from small, rotten boroughs with up to 300,000 inhabitants and granted it to other larger towns. As a result, 56 electoral districts were abolished, leaving one mandate in 20 of them. The 143 obtained mandates were distributed among counties and towns.\nThe reform considered newly emerging industrial districts, which previously had no representation in parliament. It provided for 65 mandates for them. The same number of seats was also given to rural districts, whose representatives were intended to counterbalance the bourgeoisie. Additionally, the property census was lowered in counties and towns. Since 1832, 20% of English households had gained voting rights. However, the property census still remained too high, excluding representatives of small craftsmen and merchants from voting. In rural areas, richer landowners gained voting rights after a slight reduction in the property census. Catholics gained voting rights in 1829, and Jews in 1858. Benjamin Disraeli's reform in 1867, who was a member of the third government of Edward Smith-Stanley, further lowered the property census (the number of voters increased to 2.5 million). As a result of Disraeli's reform, workers began to constitute over half of the electorate.\nThe Industrial Revolution in the 19th century led to a high development of mechanized industry and communication. The expansion of the colonial empire favored England's leading position in the global economy and politics. These differences brought about changes in the social structure: the number of the proletariat increased, and the significance of financial oligarchy grew, leading to further reforms that increased the number of voters. In 1872, secret voting was introduced. William E. Gladstone's reform between 1884 and 1885 broke with the principle that the right to vote was a privilege of certain city corporations. Counties adopted the democratic principle that this right was the subjective right of citizens. Single-member districts were introduced, except for 27 cities with populations ranging from 50 to 165 thousand, which became two-member districts. The property census was significantly lowered, resulting in an increase in the number of voters to 40% of the total population.\n\n\n=== Fight for workers' voting rights ===\n\nThe significance of landlords and gentry diminished, and in the House of Lords, representatives of big capital were increasingly numerous. The burghers and workers' groups demanded democratic reforms. The labor movement known as Chartism emerged, advocating for political demands in defense of electoral rights. The first petition in 1837 called for full democratization of elections to the House of Commons. It was rejected by the House in 1839, and many striking workers were arrested.\nChartists presented their program in the so-called Six Points of the People's Charter, the demands of which were implemented in 1867 and 1884 (granting electoral rights to social classes not included in the 1832 reform). In 1840, they founded the National Charter Association, headquartered in Manchester. This organization had a bylaw and defined authorities. Proposals for Feargus E. O'Connor's agrarian plan, the leader of the movement, were rejected, and the association itself was dissolved in 1842. After the decline of Chartism in the late 1840s, the labor movement took on a more economic character. Trade unions, legally operating since 1871, became its form.\nIn addition to the Chartist movement, other organizations operated: the Democratic Federation, the Fabian Society (1881), the dockers' union (1889), and the Independent Labour Party (1893). These were unions representing masses of unskilled workers, which formed the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1899. The main goal of the committee was to increase workers' representation in the British Parliament.\n\n\n== Parliament ==\nThe Parliament in the United Kingdom (the legislative branch) consisted of three parts: the lower house of parliament called the House of Commons, the upper house called the House of Lords, and the monarch. The latter had the right to convene parliament for sessions, however, with the countersignature and upon the request of the Prime Minister. At the same time, the sovereign was the one who opened and closed sessions, as parliament worked in sessional mode. Parliamentary work lasted throughout the week, usually from the afternoon until late at night. Saturday and Sunday were mainly reserved for meetings with constituents, and mornings during the week (except Friday) were for committee work and group meetings. Parliament was sovereign and all-powerful. It exercised control over the executive branch and had the exclusive right to enact all taxes and charges. Parliament decided on the issuance of dispensations and suspensions.\nIrish philosopher and politician Edmund Burke (18th century) expressed his views on the virtues and wonders of the English system in a metaphysical apostrophe:\n\n...the well ordered structure of our Church and State, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, guarded by the power of reverence, the power of authority, both a temple and a fortress... this awe-inspiring structure should watch over and protect the land subject to it...\n\n\n=== Ruler ===\n\nThe ruler – king/queen or otherwise monarch – exercised their power based on hereditary principles. Their authority transformed into purely representational. Initially, all power belonged to the king, or to the king in parliament, or to the king in council. Judicial decisions made in the name of the king eventually shifted to parliament, the cabinet, and the judiciaries. The maxim governing the character of the nineteenth-century British regime was: The King can do no wrong and The King reigns, but does not govern. The monarch was also inviolable and irresponsible. He also served as the head of the Anglican Church and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He could decide on war and peace. Laws could be issued in his name, which he could sanction. They had the right to summon and dissolve parliament and present government plans.\nAll real power resided in the hands of parliament, the cabinet, and the judiciaries. Cooperation between the king and the cabinet was facilitated through the prime minister. The Privy Council currently consists of 300 people. It included cabinet ministers and dignitaries. In the council, the king issued regulations, and ministers took parliamentary responsibility for them. Certain powers, known as royal prerogatives, remained with the monarch, but they were entirely representational and symbolic.\nAnother general principle was the requirement for the signature (countersignature) of the relevant ministers (from 1 to 4) for decisions made by the monarch. The ruler was well informed about political events and parliamentary proceedings, as he regularly received reports on the work of this body and held weekly audiences with the head of government.\n\n\n=== House of Lords ===\nThe House of Lords, also known as the House of Peers, consisted of hereditary and life peers (since 1876, non-hereditary law lords), and lords spiritual. In the 19th century, the right to sit in the House was held by 400 secular peers of England, lords spiritual (28 bishops and Anglican archbishops), 16 Scottish peers (since 1707), and 28 Irish peers (since 1801), including five representatives of the royal family, the Dukes of Wales, Edinburgh, Gloucester, York, and Kent. Members of the upper house of the British Parliament held titles of nobility. The power to grant titles belonged to the king, who could choose from dignities such as earl, duke, marquess, or baron.\nHereditary lords appointed from their circle those who would serve in functional roles (known as functional lords) and those who were non-functional. In the House of Lords, the title was hereditary, but it did not guarantee a seat. This house retained its aristocratic character. The Lord Chancellor presided over the House of Lords. The House of Lords was always conservative and retained the power of suspensive veto over bills. Regarding money bills, the House did not have the power of suspensive veto; it could only propose amendments. The House of Lords had limited legislative power and its judicial powers were also restricted, although it remained the highest court of appeal.\n\n\n=== House of Commons ===\n\nThe House of Commons consisted of an average of 658 members elected in general elections using the first-past-the-post voting system, in single-member electoral districts. The term of office could last a maximum of seven years (since 1716), regulated by the Septennial Act of 1715. This house emerged already in the 17th century. This was due to the fact that at the beginning of the 18th century, the Hanoverian dynasty ascended to the English throne. The king rarely resided in England and appointed the prime minister to manage the administration. The leader stood at the head of the House of Commons, while the speaker presided over the proceedings.\nThe principle of collective responsibility, known as a vote of no confidence (the first in the world), was introduced. In 1809, Parliament passed a law prohibiting the sale of seats in the House of Commons, a practice that had been quite common until then to garner support for legislative projects. However, there were certain restrictions on membership in the House of Commons, such as a ban on holding a mandate for civil servants, military personnel, and police officers. The House of Commons had two main political factions: the Tories (Conservative Party) and the Whigs (Liberal Party). It served as a representative body, exercised legislative power, conducted oversight over public finances, and scrutinized the British government. It also decided on the shape of public legislative projects presented to the monarch.\nThe seat of the British Parliament became the Palace of Westminster, a monumental building rebuilt in neo-Gothic style in 1834 after a fire destroyed the previous structure.\n\n\n=== Government and cabinet ===\n\nIn the governance system of the United Kingdom, there was a division of the executive power into three branches. The first was the government, composed of ministers appointed by the Prime Minister or by the monarch, who simultaneously represented the executive power. The Prime Minister assumed the position of the First Lord of the Treasury, while the functions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer represented the Treasury Minister. The next organ was the cabinet (a collegiate, proper governmental body), originating from the Privy Council (a political body much smaller in number than the government) that served as the proper center of power. The cabinet consisted of several ministers, including the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, and War.\nThe leader of the party that won the elections to the House of Commons was designated by the monarch to the position of Prime Minister, with the mission of forming the government. The leader of the strongest opposition party obtained the position of Leader of the Opposition. Members of the opposition party formed their own government called the shadow cabinet (a concept developed by the Conservative Party). Each minister in the legitimate government had their counterpart in the shadow cabinet. Thanks to this practice, the opposition party was prepared to potentially assume power.\nThe government, also known as the Servant of the Crown, could hinder independent legislative initiatives, evade responsibility for political actions, avoid corrective actions and changes, and shape the legal order in the United Kingdom. The government was divided into senior ministers (currently 100 members), who directed the work of individual departments, and subordinate junior ministers (from 40 to 60 members), whose main task was to ensure communication between the government and the House of Commons. The government as a whole bore collective political responsibility before the Houses.\n\n\n== Judiciary ==\n\nThe structure of the English court system, established in the 12th century, remained in place until the second half of the 19th century. The House of Lords held the status of the highest appellate court and had the authority to judge lords and ministers. The Court of Common Pleas handled civil cases, the Court of King's Bench dealt with criminal cases, and the Court of Exchequer handled complaints against the crown in fiscal matters. A notable role was played by the Court of Chancery, which applied simplified procedures (beyond common law, but according to equity principles).\nIn criminal and administrative matters, justices of the peace served as a judicial institution. From the 14th century onwards, eight justices of the peace were elected in each county. In the Middle Ages, the organization of crown courts (Courts of Assize) also emerged. Judges adjudicated criminal and civil cases in the field. The territory of England was divided into six judicial circuits, a division that was in place from the 14th to the second half of the 19th century. Additionally, \"juries of the country\" were chosen based on specified annual incomes from among landowners in each county to collaborate with justices of the peace and crown judges, forming what was known as the Grand Jury for civil or criminal cases. No qualifications were required for these appointed jurors. The legal system was dualistic, with judgments rendered in the name of the king based on common law or equity.\nFrom 1873 to 1875, all courts in the United Kingdom were consolidated into a single Supreme Court in London. The appellate function remained under the jurisdiction of the House of Lords. A separate Royal Courts of Justice was established in 1882 for England and Wales, which also became the seat of the Supreme Court. The distinctions between courts applying common law and those adjudicating on the basis of equity were abolished. At a lower level, county courts were established in 1846, while the justices of the peace continued their activities, overseen voluntarily by local notables.\nDistinctive procedural features of the English courts included:\n\nLack of a separate Ministry of Justice\nA small professional judiciary\nAbsence of a distinct representative in criminal proceedings\nThe Appellate Tribunal was the House of Lords. There was no institution of administrative courts in the British judiciary, a role still performed by county courts and justices of the peace.\n\n\n== Structure of local governments ==\n\nThe beginnings of the English local government system date back to the Middle Ages when a peace judge represented the king in each county. England remained an example of a country whose territorial administration relied solely on local government bodies until the end of the 19th century. They had broad powers and evolved towards decentralization. In the 19th century, local government reforms were carried out. The first stage, initiated between 1832 and 1835, concerned cities. Democratic elections were introduced for city councils and executive bodies of mayors and aldermen. County government was also reformed.\nIn 1871, a separate ministry was introduced to standardize and control the activities of local government – the Local Government Board. In 1888, administration passed into the hands of county councils operating in 52 newly established administrative counties (the second stage of reform). In 1894, counties were divided into urban and rural districts. District councils were established, and in larger parishes, parish councils were formed, creating a two-tier (counties, districts) and three-tier administrative division (counties, districts, and parishes). Temporarily, a five-tier model of local government took shape there, consisting of:\n\nCounties,\nmunicipalities,\ndistricts,\nsocial welfare unions,\nparishes.\nLondon had a separate local government organization. Executive power was exercised by the London County Council, which was supported by district councils. Councillors met in plenary sessions and in individual committees. They also employed professional officials who acted as executors of the councils' orders. In addition to the comprehensive and integrated local government administration, non-integrated administration began to develop. To streamline, standardize, and control local government, the Local Government Board was established.\n\n\n=== Division of powers of local government structures ===\nThe essence of the administrative division in the UK was the division of competencies, which rested with individual local government units. The respective councils had responsibility for:\n\nCounty councils: education, maintenance of public roads, social care, fire protection, police, and libraries. The council was led by a chairman.\nDistrict councils: construction, local taxes, cemetery maintenance, and waste disposal. The council was chaired by a chairman, and in borough-type districts, by a mayor.\nParish councils: maintenance of allotment gardens and urban greenery. The council was led by a chairman. In parishes where there was no council, the decision-making body was the parish trustee, chaired by the chairman of the parish meeting, a councilor from the district council.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited Kingdom\nPolitics of the United Kingdom\nAdministrative geography of the United Kingdom\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBazylow, Ludwik (1986).

She was educated in painting by Étienne-Charles Le Guay and Daniel Saint; Saint was influenced by the works of Jean-Baptiste Isabey, and this influence is reflected in Thibault's portraits.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\n\nThibault made her debut at the Salon art exhibition in Paris in 1804 and continued to exhibit her art there until 1810. In 1817 she painted miniatures of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and his wife Maria Isabel of Braganza, described by the author Manuel Ossorio y Bernard as \"perfect in appearance and cleanliness of work\". She traveled to New York City for a short time in 1836.\nThibault died on 6 February 1868 at her house in Paris; she was buried on 7 February at Montmartre Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Roger Shakespear also written as Roger Shakespeare (flourished 1777–1782) was a botanical collector. He is known to have collected specimens in South America, North America and Jamaica for Sir Joseph Banks (1743–1820) and Dr John Fothergill (1712–1780).\nRoger Shakespear may also be the \"Mr. Shakespear\" recorded as collecting fish from Jamaica and sending them to the British Museum, where they were catalogued by Daniel Solander (1733–1782) in the 1760s. Some of these fish were then sent to the Faculty of Medicine at Montpellier by Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet (1761–1807), then to the Musee d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris by 1828, where they were studied by Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) and Achille Valenciennes (1794–1865).\n\nRoger Shakespear contacted John Fothergill circa July 1777, seeking a plant-collecting assignment but needing £100 to fund it. Fothergill had high estimation of Shakespear's talent: \"he will be able to collect specimens in perfection - and to send us the seed.\" Fothergill petitioned several friends, alongside himself, to each contribute a £20 stake to Shakespear's trip: James Lee (Scottish nurseryman and botanist, 1715–1795), William Malcolm (a London nurseryman, d. 1798), Dr William Pitcairn (botanist and physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital, 1712–1791) and Joseph Banks. [The £100 Shakespear needed for his expenses roughly equates to a modern value of £11,000 as of May 2024].\nShakespear can be placed in Jamaica in the year 1777 thanks to dated specimens he collected, e.g. Columnea hirsuta and Marcgravia brownei and the ferns Osmunda regalis  and Hymenophyllum sericeum.\nOn 2 April 1779 Matthew Wallen of Jamaica wrote to Joseph Banks to say he had some plants ready for Shakespear, and was going to arrange Shakespear a passage to the Bay of Honduras.\n\nPerhaps relating to Shakespear's intention to travel to the Bay of Honduras in 1779, the entomologist Dru Drury (1725–1803) owned and described a specimen of a giant damselfly from the Bay of Honduras, number 79 in his cabinet, which he had labelled with its collector's name: \"Libellula caerulata, Muskito Shore. Mr Shakespear, 1779.\" First described by Drury as Lestes caerulatus, this damselfly species is now known as Megaloprepus caerulatus (Drury, 1782).\nRoger Shakespear is recorded as having collected the plants \"purple spider-wort\" [Tradescantia discolor, now known as Rhoeo discolor (L'Hér.)] and \"yellow flower-fence\" Guilandina moringa in Honduras in 1782, which were planted in the garden of Hinton East (d. 1792) at Liguanea, Jamaica. Hinton East was Receiver General of Jamaica and his botanical collections were later transferred to the Hope Estate, part of which eventually became the Hope Botanical Gardens.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBotanical specimens collected by Roger Shakespear are held in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, National Museums Liverpool, and the Linnean Society of London, where they are part of the herbarium collection which once belonged to James Edward Smith (1759–1828).\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n=== Roger Shakespear, contemporary Naval Captain ===\nA Captain Roger Shakespear of the Royal Navy appears in the historical record as active in the West Indies contemporaneously with Roger Shakespear the botanical collector. Captain Roger Shakespear was Regulating Captain for Kingston and the Windward Parishes, and was advertising to recruit men for an expedition by King's Proclamation in November 1779.  Regulating Captains were employed to examine men impressed by press gangs, and were often elderly or had no prospect of going to sea themselves. However Roger Shakespear of the Jamaica Volunteers was an active participant in the San Juan Expedition, making contact with the St Blas Indians to seek assistance, and was later listed as having drowned on 7 April 1780. Roger Shakespear the botanical collector appears to have been alive and active until at least 1782.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On January 25 and 26 1992, an Azerbaijani-led operation was carried out with the aim of liberating the village of Karintak, near Shusha, from the control of the Armenian-allied Republic of Artsakh. It started at 20:00 on January 25, 1992, and ended unsuccessfully on the evening of January 26. Former Minister of Defense, Major General Tajaddin Mehdiyev directly led the operation. Three volunteer divisions of the newly formed Azerbaijan Army and fighters of the defense camp of Shusha took part in the operation.\nAs a result of tactical mistakes, lack of communication between the groups, the spread of the operational secret and the betrayal of the guides, the Azerbaijani platoons entering Karintak from the direction of Nəbilər village were ambushed by Armenian forces and completely destroyed. Several platoons that entered the village were able to retreat with significant losses.The battle lasted just over 12 hours. According to official information, the Azerbaijani Army lost more than 90 people in the Karintak operation.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe operation involved 200 soldiers from the Shikhov battalion. Former Defence Minister Tajaddin Mehdiyev was in charge of the operation. Self-defense units from the nearby villages of Shosh, Syznek, Skhnakh, Karmir-gyukh were sent to help the residents of Karintak. All work was carried out at night, and during the visible time of day the village lived an ordinary life. Karintak was clearly visible from Shushi, any movement in the village, any preparatory work would have been noticed.\nAccording to the first plan, the platoon was to pass through the village of Nebiler, climb up to the height of Harutyunagomer, and from there cut the road that leads from Karintak to the village of Signakh. According to the second plan, the platoon was supposed to block the road leading from Karintak to the village of Shushakand.\nUnfavourable weather conditions, lack of communication between the platoons, leaking of secret information about the operation and betrayal of the guides led to the failure of the operation. The platoon which reached Karintak was ambushed. The other platoons also suffered losses and were forced to withdraw from the area.The total loss of the Azerbaijani Army during the failure of the operation was 90 men.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Forces of Change (Arabic: قوى التغيير) is a parliamentary bloc in the Lebanese parliament which comprises multiple reformist parties and independents. It originally consisted of 13 MPs following the 2022 Lebanese general election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMany reformist groups emerged during the 2018 Lebanese general elections standing against the 9-year ruling and mostly repeat deputies in parliament and sought for change. Most notable of the group was the Kuluna Watani alliance. The alliance gathered with a new Political Party (\"Sabaa\") and 10 different campaigns and groups, most of which are connected to campaigns started in the protest movements of 2015 or the municipal elections of 2016. The alliance included in addition to Sabaa which is a nationwide secular Political Party few local political groups, namely Libaladi in Beirut 1 and Lihaqqi in Mount Lebanon 4. Speaking at an inauguration event, Charbel Nahas, whose party Citizens within a State joined the Koullouna Watani lists at a later stage, said the purpose of the lists was to provide an alternative to the \"corrupted\" power in Lebanese politics. The Shiite Taharror movement was also established in the wake of the protests.\n\n\n== 2022 elections ==\nDuring the 2022 Lebanese general elections, many activists and previous organizations expressed intent to run with goals of replacing the political class and reforming the country. These organizations include, Citizens in a State which ran under the Qadreen lists, Shamaluna which ran in the North III district and the Mada network which was made out of multiple smaller reform groups. Many older and tradition parties joined October 17 lists such as the historic National Bloc Party and the Lebanese Communist Party and other larger parties claimed to be members of the movement like the Kataeb party, the Independence Movement and the Popular Nasserist Organization (PNO).\nIn total, these candidates received 237,667 votes (13.14%) and won 13 seats which formed a new reformist bloc in the Lebanese parliament.\n\n\n== Deputies ==\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nAlong with many others, it was in nature for October 17 MPs to opt out on voting for long-time speaker Nabih Berri. For the deputy speaker the MPs voted for newly elected MP Ghassan Skaff however he still lost to long-time politician Elias Bou Saab.\nThe 2 secretaries of parliament were elected immediately after the Deputy Speaker. Although not constitutionally required, it was decided that the secretaries would be attributed to one Maronite Christian and one Druze. The election process of the 2 deputies had large debate particularly by opposition MPs. It was suggested that each MP votes for both preferences in the same ballot and that the positions should not be based on religion. However, it was decided that voting would take place on the basis of one name per ballot. As a result of this Firas Hamdan, an opposition MP, who was one of few candidates for the Druze secretary, withdrew his candidacy in protest of the sectarian electoral procedure.\n\n\n==== Disputes and withdrawals ====\nThe newly formed bloc continuously faced disagreements with each other, like voting on the premiership and the presidency, failure to create common grounds with other parliamentary blocs and failing to unite with the parliament opposition. This led to the withdrawal of 2 MPs from the bloc, Michel Doueihy of Osos Lebanon and Waddah Sadek of Khatt Ahmar, both citing political tensions.\n\n\n== See also ==\n17 October Revolution\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Esc-Scèbb, also known as the Battle of the Esc-Scèbb wells, was fought on 8 December 1913 in the fields north of Esc-Scebb, between the departments of the Regio Esercito, commanded by lieutenant Antonio Giuseppe Miani and the Libyan guerrillas of Mohammed ben Abdallah. The battle can be classified as part of the First phase of the Italian colonization of Libya.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn August 1913, a military expedition composed of 1,100 men (only 108 nationals, and the rest colonial), 4 70/15 Mod. 1902 mountain guns, 4 Vickers machine guns, 4 light trucks and 1,765 camels, commanded by Lieutenant Antonio Giuseppe Miani, left Sirte heading towards Socna. This location, defined as \"The gate of Fezzan\", was decided as a support base for the Italian penetration into the desert region of Fezzan, which until then had remained under Ottoman control until October 1912, and then in the hands of the Libyan guerrillas by 1913. Miani, promoted to lieutenant colonel of the General Staff, was chosen, at the end of April 1913, by the then Minister of the Colonies, the Honorable Bertolini, to lead a military expedition into the Libyan hinterland. The occupation of Fezzan was initially planned and studied by the previous Governor of the Colony, Lieutenant General Ragni and then by his successor, General Garioni and considered of primary importance to consolidate the Italian occupation of the Fourth Shore. After a brief stop in Socna, the expedition left in the first days of December and crossed the Gebel el-Soda entering Fezzan.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 8 December 1913, around 2 PM, the vanguard of the Miani expedition spotted a large quantity of camels from afar, around 60, escorted by around 600 armed men. The men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Miani, who had just set foot in Fezzan with the task of occupying it, until that moment unopposed, are preparing for their first clash against Mohammed Ben Abdallah's fighters. The enemy column was moving to carry out an outflanking maneuver aimed at hitting the rear and flank of the Italian formation.\nThe column continued to move in the same direction, but Captain Streva's Libyan group broke away from it and had to divert its march, head north and stop the advance of the enemy frontally, assisted by the artillery fire of the Mondini battery. In the meantime, the 1st and 2nd Eritrean companies, under the command of Major Suarez and positioned on the left flank of the column, began an outflanking movement to the south which with a rapid turn towards the west would have denied any enemy attempt to reach the oasis of Esc Scebb. Supporting the advance of the Eritreans was the Locurcio battery, located 400 meters away with the Mondini battery. Around 2:30 PM the clash began, the guerrillas taken by surprise stopped their march and sought shelter to return fire. The artillery did not stand by and watched, they placed the pieces in ten minutes and at 2:55 PM they opened fire on the Libyan guerrillas, firing a total of 72 shots in a short time. Supported by the artillery, the Eritrean companies advanced in large leaps towards the enemy, managing to disperse the caravan. De Dominicis and his men also managed to capture the head of Bel Gasim el Beddi, commander of the battle on the side of the Libyan militants, who died shortly afterwards. The second in command, Omar Abd el Nebi, also lost his life with him. The guerrillas lost about a hundred men, including about eighty near the wells during the battle and the rest in the ruinous retreat after it. The Italians left only three dead and six wounded on the field, including Captain Giorgetti who was wounded in the right leg.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1987–88 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters and the Auburn Tigers. The game was played on April 3, 1988, at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington. After trailing 31–17 at halftime, No. 5 Louisiana Tech stormed back to defeat No. 3 Auburn 56–54 to capture the program's second NCAA national championship. Erica Westbrooks was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters ===\n\nThe Lady Techsters, who represented the Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana, were led by head coach Leon Barmore, in his 3rd season as head coach at the school. After finishing runner-up the prior season, Louisiana Tech opened this season ranked No. 5 in the AP poll and, like Auburn, spent the entirety of the season inside the top 5. They finished the regular season right back where they started – ranked No. 5 in both major polls.\nIn the NCAA tournament, La Tech defeated Kansas, Ole Miss, and No. 4 Texas to reach the fourth NCAA Final Four in program history. They won 68–59 over No. 1 and defending National champion Tennessee in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game with a 31–2 record. The Lady Techsters knocked off the top-ranked, defending National champions in the National semifinal for the second straight season.\n\n\n=== Auburn Tigers ===\n\nThe Tigers, who represented the Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, were led by head coach Joe Ciampi in his 9th season at the school. Auburn began the season ranked No. 3 in the AP Poll. After spending the first 14 polls at either No. 3 or No. 2, the Tigers peaked at No. 1 for two of the final three weeks before finishing the regular season back at No. 3 in both major polls.\nPlaying as the No. 1 seed in the Mideast region of the NCAA tournament, the Lady Tigers defeated Penn State, No. 17 Georgia (on the road), and No. 9 Maryland to reach the first Final Four in program history. In the National semifinals, Auburn defeated No. 7 Long Beach State, 68–55. The 32–2 Tigers entered the matchup with No. 5 Louisiana Tech as the slight favorite.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Woman with a Blue Pencil is a 2015 metafictional mystery novel by Gordon McAlpine. It was first published by Prometheus Books, via their Seventh Street imprint.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nOn December 6, 1941, Sam Sumida is a Japanese-American academic in Los Angeles, whose quest to find the murderer of his wife is disrupted when he finds himself six weeks in the future, in a world where no one remembers he ever existed... because, in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the novel whose protagonist he was has been rewritten.\nElsewhere, Maxine Wakefield is an editor of mystery novels, writing letters to Takumi Sato — one of her authors, who is now in a Japanese internment camp — in which she explains that American readers will no longer accept the notion of a Japanese hero pursuing a white criminal, and coaxes Sato into rewriting his novel so that it is about Jimmy Park, a Korean-American private detective hunting Japanese spies.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe novel was a finalist for the 2016 Edgar Award for Best Paperback Original.\nIn a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised McAlpine for his \"masterly critique\" of the mystery genre, and emphasized that the novel \"works both as a conventional mystery story and as a deconstruction of the genre's ideology\", such that regardless of whether readers follow Sam or Jimmy, \"the parallel stories pack a brutal punch.\" The Historical Novel Society called it \"superb\" and \"highly recommended\".\nPaste noted that the excerpts from The Revised [the novel featuring Sam] and The Orchid and the Secret Agent [the novel featuring Jimmy] show that both are \"fast-paced, rip-roaring reads\", and lauded McAlpine for the \"sequencing of excerpts and letters\", such that when \"an excerpt from The Orchid and the Secret Agent (...) contains a particularly heavy-handed bit of patriotic grandstanding or xenophobic bile, or a dropped-in detail that seems ridiculously out of place,\" it is followed immediately by \"the missive from the editor that mandated its inclusion.\"\nThe Los Angeles Review of Books found it to be a \"thrill to read\", and an \"ingeniously structured metafictional noir of surprising depth\" which \"critiqu[es] the art and artifice of writing, editing, and publishing\", and observed that the three narratives affect each other, with \"the Orchid\" (the \"dragon lady caricature\" who commands the \"network of Japanese assassins\" that Jimmy must infiltrate) being recognizably based on Sam's murdered wife, and Sam's former home being filled with photos of Jimmy.\n\n\n== References ==",

He served as the minister of labor between 1960 and 1961. He is known for being the pioneer of social politics in Turkey.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTalas was born in Trabzon, Ottoman Empire, in 1917. After his secondary education he started his university education at the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University in 1935 and graduated in 1938. Following his graduation he was sent by the Ministry of Finance to France to pursue his doctorate studies in 1938, but he could not complete his education due to the outbreak of World War II and had to return to Turkey in 1940. \nTalas restarted his doctorate studies in 1943 and received his Ph.D. from the University of Geneva in 1947. The title of his thesis was La Legislation du Travail Industriel en Turquie (French: Industrial Labor Legislation in Türkiye). Talas reported later that Anthony Babel and Edgard Milhaud, his professors at the University of Geneva, affected his selection of this topic.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nTalas worked at the Ministry of Finance and then at the Ministry of Labor where he worked as research council rapporteur until 1953 when he joined the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University. The same year he was promoted to associated professor and to full professor in 1958. He first taught social economics course at the Faculty.\nTalas was named as the minister of labor to the first cabinet of President Cemal Gürsel announced on 28 May 1960. The cabinet was formed immediately after the military coup of 27 May 1960 which ended the rule of Democrat Party. Talas was reappointed to the same post in 1961 to the second cabinet of Cemal Gürsel. Talas held the post for one year and returned to his teaching post at Ankara University. During his ministerial post Talas signed the European Social Charter on behalf of Turkey. He also played a significant role in the inclusion of the right to strike in the new Constitution of Turkey. \nTalas served as the dean of the Faculty of Political Science for two terms: from 1960 to 1961 and from 1970 to 1971. Following the 1971 memorandum he was arrested and imprisoned for a while along with other leading academics from Ankara University, including Mümtaz Soysal and Bahri Savcı. Talas retired from  university in 1983. \nTalas was a member of the Republican People's Party. He was also involved in the formation of the Social Democracy Party in 1983 after his retirement. He was member of various associations and foundations, including Turkish Human Rights Association, Turkish Cooperative Association, Turkish Economic Association, Atatürkist Thought Association and History Foundation.\n\n\n=== Work and views ===\nTalas published many books and articles in Turkish and in French. He was among the contributors of the Forum magazine.\nFor Talas the goal of the 1960 coup was to reestablish social justice in order to transform the Turkish society. He was one of the supporters of the right to strike in Turkey and published many articles on this issue in various newspapers. He argued that increasing worker wages has positive effects on industrial development. He also regarded the collaboration between employers and employees as one of the prerequisites of the economic development.\n\n\n== Death ==\nTalas died of heart failure at his home in Ankara on 14 October 2006. After the ceremony at the Faculty of Political Sciences and funeral prayers in the Kocatepe Mosque he was buried in the Karşıyaka Cemetery on 17 October.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAn annual prize in social politics was inaugurated by the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University in 2012 in memory of Cahit Talas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Borisz Bájity (Serbian Cyrillic: Борис Бајић, romanized: Boris Bajić; born 1982) is a Serbian politician from the country's Hungarian community. He is a delegate in Serbia's Hungarian National Council and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024. Bájity is a member of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMSZ).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBájity was born in Subotica in what was then the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He holds a master's degree from the University of Novi Sad Faculty of Law. After completing an internship, he began working for the provincial government's secretariat for education, regulations, governance, and national minority communities. He was appointed as first deputy secretary-general of the Assembly of Vojvodina in October 2017.\n\n\n== Politician ==\nBájity appeared in the eighty-ninth position on the VMSZ's electoral list in the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election and the fiftieth position in the 2020 parliamentary election. These positions were too low for election to be a realistic prospect, and he was not elected when the party won four and nine seats, respectively.\nHe later appeared in the thirtieth position out of thirty-five on the Hungarian Unity list for Serbia's Hungarian National Council in the 2022 election. The outcome of the election was not in doubt; no other lists participated, and Hungarian Unity won every seat. He is now a member of the council's committee on official language and use of writing.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian ===\nBájity appeared in the third position on the VMSZ's list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election and was elected to the national assembly when the list won six seats. He is a deputy member of the committee on the rights of the child, the committee on human and minority rights and gender equality, and the committee on the judiciary, public administration, and local self government. In the assembly, the VMSZ supports Serbia's government led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\nBájity was elected as a vice-president of the VMSZ in March 2024. He also became a substitute member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on 15 April 2024. He serves with the European People's Party (EPP) group and is an alternate member of the committee on equality and non-discrimination.\nBájity has received the symbolic next-to-last position (twenty-ninth out of thirty) on the VMSZ's electoral list for the Novi Sad city assembly in the 2024 Serbian local elections.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Battle of Insein was a 1949 battle during the Karen conflict  where the Karen National Defence Organisation briefly captured the town of Insein, 9 miles from Rangoon. After 111 days of intense fighting, the KNDO failed their goal of capturing Rangoon, and retreated into the countryside.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nDuring the leadup to Burma's independence from Britain, Karen groups were unwillingly to be in a Bamar-dominated country but faced internal divides over the territory of a Karen state and the extent to which they should respect Bamar demands. With this context, the KNU headquarters ordered the establishment of Karen defence militias, known as Karen National Defence Organisations, on 17 July 1947. In October 1947, the dominant political party of Burma- the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), asked the KNU to create a Karen state within Burma, but the KNU refused, demanding more territory.\nFollowing independence, intercommunal violence grew in the Irrawaddy Delta. This violence was blamed on the KNDO by official government accounts, but such incidents were likely carried out by other Karen militias.  Prime minister U Nu and Karen leader Saw Ba U Gyi attempted to de-escalate by touring the delta. To build newfound trust, U Nu allowed the KNDO to recapture Twante near Yangon from the Communist Party of Burma. The KNDO successfully took the Twante canal back but Bamar news organisations were badly informed about this operation, leading to many in Yangon to panic about an impending Karen insurrection.\nOn 1 September 1948, joint KNDO and ethnic Karen military police seized control of Thaton and Mawlamyine. This first move was poorly coordinated and would eventually spark the Karen conflict. Just four days later, the KNDO allowed central government forces to land in Mawlamyine before handing the city back. While the government had doubted the intentions of the KNU, this occupation increased their fears. Conflict increased as a series of retaliatory incidents and massacres escalated following a Bamar militia killing 200 Karens during a Christmas Eve service in a Palaw church.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 31 January 1949, the KNU formally declared war on the government and the KNDO was outlawed just four days afterwards. U Nu set up Sitwundan militias who began to demand the KNDOs and ethnic Karen military police to surrender their arms before engaging in battle. The Sitwundans surrounded the KNU headquarters in Insein where local KNDOs had raided the armoury earlier. Nearby KNDOs were called in to defend the quarters with the garrison reaching over 400 members. The KNDO successfully infiltrated Mingaladon airport four miles from Insein, but chose only to capture ammunition. Indian diplomats negotiated a ceasefire between the KNDO and the Burmese military in early February, but it only lasted for three days. The central government attacked Insein with battleships from the Hlaing River. During this time, certain portions of the countryside were under KNDO control, including Hinthada District in northern Ayeyarwady Region. KNDO forces also captured Mandalay, Pyin Oo Lwin,  Meiktila, Toungoo, and Mawlamyine.  The KNDOs in the delta attacked Pyu and Pathein as a distractionary attempt but ultimately failed to do anything but escalate tensions further.\nWith aid from ethnic Chin, Karenni, Shan, Gurkha, and even Communist fighters, the  Battle of Insein eventually ended in the Burmese government's favour. As KNDO positions north of Yangon fell day by day, KNDOs quietly retreated across the Hlaing River and escaped into the countryside. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nShortly after the battle, the Burmese Army's commander-in-chief, Smith Dun (an ethnic Karen), resigned.  The Burmese Army initially being on the verge of total defeat also led to hardline militarists demanding Ne Win to start a coup d'état, which he eventually did in 1962\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "YZ Leonis Minoris, also known as SDSS J0926+3624, is a star system in the constellation Leo Minor. It is an AM Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, a type of binary systems with ultra-short periods (between 5 and 70 minutes). It is also an eclipsing binary. The apparent magnitude of the system is generally 19.3m, varying by about two magnitudes due to periodic eclipses and outbursts. The distance to YZ LMi is of 815 pc (2,660 ly).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nYZ Leonis Minoris is made up of a white dwarf star and a low-mass donor companion. The white dwarf accretes matter from the companion via a helium-rich accretion disk. The disk around the white dwarf has a size ranging from 18,000 to 90,800 km, which is about 45% of the orbital separation of the components. The temperature of the disk varies from 5,000 K (in the outer parts of the disk) to 23,000 K (in the inner parts of the disk).\nThe system has a normal apparent magnitude of 19.33m, which is way lower than the limit for naked -eye vision (6.5m), making it not visible to the naked eye. A recent estimate from Gaia DR3 gives a distance of 815 pc (2,660 ly) for YZ Leonis Minoris, which is significantly larger than previous estimates (of 460–470 pc). \nSDSS J0926+3624 is both an AM Canum Venaticorum variable and an eclipsing variable (eclipsing binary). AM Canum Venaticorum stars are ultracompact systems, deficient in hydrogen, with orbital periods in order of minutes. Eclipsing binaries are systems where the system's components eclipses each other. The white dwarf is partially eclipsed by its donor companion.\nYZ Leonis Minoris is a very compact system. The orbital period of the stars is just 28 minutes, making it the eclipsing binary system with the shortest orbital period. The components are separated at a distance of 0.29 solar radii (200,000 km), and the surface-to-surface distance is 167,000 km.\n\n\n=== White dwarf ===\nThe primary component of the system is a white dwarf. It has a mass between 0.79 and 0.89 M☉ and a radius of 0.01 R☉ (1.09 R🜨). The white dwarf's surface gravity is about 200,000 times stronger than Earth's gravity. Its effective temperature is estimated to be at least 17,000 K, and Sengupta et al. (2011) found three temperatures between 18,000 and 25,000 K. Its luminosity is about 0.009–0.035 times the solar luminosity. The white dwarf is accreting mass from the companion at a rate of 10–10 solar masses per year, based on evolutionary models.\n\n\n=== Low-mass companion ===\nThe secondary component of the system is a low-mass companion. It has a mass estimated to be between 0.027 and 0.038 M☉ (28.3 and 39.8 MJ) and its radius is estimated at 0.043 solar radii (29,900 km). The mass of the companion makes it semi-degenerate, it would be fully degenerate if its had a mass close to 0.02 M☉. Its temperature is estimated to be at 3,570 K (3,300 °C), with an upper limit of 3,700 K (3,430 °C). The luminosity of the companion is equivalent to 0.00035 times the solar luminosity.\n\n\n== Variability ==\n\nSDSS J0926+2634 is an AM Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, which is a type of cataclysmic variable system that are ultracompact and deficient in hydrogen, with orbital periods of just some minutes. It is also an eclipsing binary, a type of binary stars where the components eclipse each other, causing variation in the apparent brightness. The American Association of Variable Star Observers also mentions YZ Leonis Minoris as a SU Ursae Majoris-type star (dwarf nova). YZ Leonis Minoris was the first system discovered that is both an eclipsing binary and an AM Canum Venaticorum star. As of 2022, more than 8 such systems are known.\nThe system presents eclipses every 28 minutes, which decrease the system's apparent magnitude by 2 magnitudes and last about two minutes, in addition to presenting outbursts that make the system's apparent magnitude increase by two magnitudes. YZ Leonis Minoris' mean apparent magnitude is 19.33m, decreasing to 17.11–16.81m during the outbursts. These outbursts happen every 100–200 days and are likely generated by bursts of enhanced mass transfer from donor star to the white dwarf.\nYZ Leonis Minoris is the variable-star designation of the system.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nYZ Leonis Minoris was discovered in 2005 by Anderson et al. in a search for spectroscopically unsual objects, after an examination of spectra of 280,000 SDSS objects. It was discovered together with three other objects: SDSS J0129+3842, SDSS J1411+4812, and SDSS J1552+3201. \n\n\n== See also ==\nCataclysmic variable star\nLeo Minor\nAM Canum Venaticorum\nAM Canum Venaticorum star\nVariable star\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joppeicus paradoxus is a predatory heteropteran bug and the only member of the genus Joppeicus and the family Joppeicidae. Adults are ~3 mm long.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nJ.paradoxus has been described as living in «gardens, fields, planted woods, street alleys» along the Nile River and also caves, rock crevices of the nearby desert or semidesert regions. It can be found under bark, herbs, leaf litter, stones, litter, or even among mammalian feces and burrows of the rodent genus Meriones.\nIt feeds on a variety of small arthopods, such as coleopteran larvae and adults, ants, other heteropterans, spiders and ticks.\n\n\n== Behaviour ==\nIt is quite active, runs quickly and tends to avoid light during the day.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIt has been originally described from Jaffa and documented from Israel and in Egypt and Sudan along the Nile and Ethiopia. It has recently been found in Fuerteventura and Socotra and even in a bean storage area in Thailand.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\nA molecular genetics study in 2022 recovered Joppeicidae within Cimicomorpha as the closest relative of family Microphysidae,  forming together the clade Microphysoidea. Another study in 2023 instead recovers Joppeicidae as the earliest diverging group of Cimiciformes.\n\n\n== Importance to humans ==\nJ.paradoxus has been investigated as a potential biocontrol insect against insect pests affecting food storage, such as Tribolium confusum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Assaf Razin is an economist, academic, and author. He is a Schwartz Professor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University and The former Barbara and Steven Friedman Professor of International Economics, Cornell University.\nRazin is known for his works on international and public economics. His written works include contributions to academic journals like the American Economic Review, Journal of Monetary Economics and the Journal of Political Economy, as well as authoring books such as Fiscal Policies and Growth in the World Economy, Population Economics, Israel and the World Economy: Power of Globalization and Globalization, Migration, and Welfare State: Macroeconomic Trifecta. Moreover, he is the recipient of 2017 EMET Prize in economics.\nRazin is a fellow of various professional organizations including Fellow of the Econometric Society.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRazin's parents arrived in Israel in the late 1930s from Bessarabia in then Romania (now Moldova and Ukraine) and founded Kibbutz Shamir where Razin's early life unfolded, shaped by its communal ethos and its remote location as a border settlement. A tragic incident during military service led to unexpected opportunities beyond the kibbutz's confines, paving the way for his unconventional transition from an agricultural collectivistic place to attending top universities, and eventual pursuit of graduate studies at the University of Chicago. Razin completed his undergraduate studies in agricultural economics from Hebrew University in 1963, followed by an M.A in Agricultural Economics in 1966. Later in 1968, he completed his M.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago, followed by a Ph.D. in Economics from the same institution in 1969.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRazin holds extensive academic experience as a visiting professor at various elite Universities in the US, from his permanent base at Tel Aviv University, Israel. From 200 to 2015 he held the position of the Friedman Professor of International Economics at Cornell University. Throughout  his academic career, he has held various visiting appointments at various institutions, including University of Chicago,  Harvard, Stanford, University of Minnesota, London School of Economics, the University of Munich, Yale University, and Princeton University. Since 2008, he is a Schwartz Professor Emeritus at Tel-Aviv University.\nRazin served in the late 1970s as the chief economic adviser to the Israeli government. His academic administrative experience includes an appointment as the Chair of the Department of Economics at Tel Aviv University from 1974 to 1976. Subsequently, he held the position of dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tel Aviv University from 1981 to 1986, and Deputy Rector in the early 1990s. Throughout his career, Razin has held diverse advisory appointments at institutions such as the World Bank, and International Monetary Fund, Bank of England and the European Central Bank.\n\n\n== Books ==\nIn addition to 150 scientific articles in economic Journals, Razin has authored various books and monographs throughout his career. In 1978, he co-authored the book A Theory of International Trade Under Uncertainty with Elhanan Helpman. The book explored how the basic theories of international trade are extended and revised in the presence of uncertainty and risk-sharing financial institutions. In 1987, he co-authored a book with Jacob A. Frenkel, Fiscal Policies in the World Economy. The book provided an intertemporal -based analysis of fiscal policies and their effects on economic growth in the global context, integrating traditional and modern approaches in open economy macroeconomics and public economics, with a focus on topics such as government spending, budget deficits, international taxation, and economic convergence across countries.\nRazin's books on the Israeli economy, The economy of Modern Israel: Malaise and Promise (1993),  and Israel and the World Economy: The Power of Globalization (2018), explore the effects of immigration, building of economic institutions, technological advancement, and controlling inflation generated  the “economic miracle” whereby Israel transformed from a low income agricultural economy into a fully advanced economy.”\nIn 1992 he co-authored with Jacob Frenkel and Efraim Sadka, International Economics, which provides analytical theory for the international ramifications of income and value-added taxation. In 1995, he co-authored  with Efraim Sadka, the book Population Economics, wherein they explored the evolution of economic theories (such as Malthusian and Becker theories, on population growth, focusing on microeconomic factors such as fertility decisions, labor supply, and intergenerational transfers, and their implications for economic policy and social issues. In 2001, he authored the book Labor, Capital, and Finance: International Flows. The book integrated disparate elements of economics into a unified framework, focusing on capital, labor, and finance within globalization, catering to advanced undergraduate and graduate courses as well as serving as a reference text for applied researchers and policy professionals. In his 2011 book, he examined the interplay between immigration policies, welfare states, and economic dynamics, considering factors such as skill and age composition of immigrants, fiscal burdens, and the implications for both host and source countries, particularly focusing on Europe and developed nations. His 2014 book Understanding Global Crises offers a comprehensive analysis of various global financial crises, integrating common and disparate threads into an empirically testable analytical framework while exploring developments in the New Keynesian analytical framework post-2008. Furthermore, his more recent book Globalization, Migration, and Welfare State: Macroeconomic Trifecta explores the intricate interplay between globalization, migration, and the welfare state.\n\n\n== Research ==\nRazin's early research established a link between population theory and economic growth theory by analyzing an intergenerational model of optimum population growth, considering factors such as the quality of life for new populations, consumption levels, public support for investment in children, intergenerational differences in preferences, and uncertainty in population changes. His 1983 collaborative research with LEO Svensson and others analyzed the impact of terms-of-trade changes on a small country's spending and current account under perfect international capital mobility and an intertemporal framework, considering both temporary and permanent fluctuations and the influence of individuals' time preferences on trade balance outcomes. In his 1986 study, he employed a two-country general equilibrium model to analyze the effects of budget deficits and government spending on global interest rates, consumption, and international indebtedness, exploring the differences between fiscal expenditures and tax cuts, current versus expected future policies, and the welfare implications of budget deficits.\nRazin's 1991 research examined global capital income taxation and tax competition, showing that coordinated policies reduce the need for tax harmonization, whereas insufficient coordination results in lower capital taxes and burdens on immobile factors, limiting effective tax tools. Later in 1994, he proposed a method to compute effective tax rates using national accounts and revenue data, highlighting international differences in tax policy and demonstrating the consistency of these rates with general equilibrium economic frameworks. His 2000 study investigated factors influencing large adjustments in current account deficits and exchange rates in low- and middle-income countries, distinguishing between triggers of currency crises and current account reversals, finding that domestic and external factors play key roles with different economic impacts. In 2006, he developed a theoretical model explaining how information asymmetry influences the choice between foreign direct investments (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments (FPI), highlighting how investors' information advantages impact investment decisions, resale prices, and the observed patterns of investment flows across developed and developing countries. While exploring how welfare state generosity affects migration rates, his 2015 study found that within free labor movement areas like the EU, welfare states attract skilled migrants, while in restricted migration contexts, they may draw unskilled migrants, potentially increasing fiscal burdens. More recently in 2022, his work offered a nuanced analysis of how income-based globalization attitudes interact with national government policies, shedding light on the complex relationship between economic interests, trade dynamics, and welfare-state outcomes in the context of a globalized economy.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1994 – Fellow of the Econometric Society\n2017 – EMET Prize in Economics\n2022 – Fellow, International Economic Association\n\n\n== Family ==\nRazin is married to Shula Razin. His children are Ofer Razin (deceased,1999), Ronny Razin, and Einat Razin; his grandchildren are Iddo Razin and Neeve Razin. Assaf Razin's parents Mordechai (Musia) Berezin (born in Kishinev, Moldova)) and Dora Leibovitch (born in Yasi, Romania) migrated to Israel before WWII and founded Kibbutz Shamir where he was born and raised.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nLabor, Capital, and Finance: International Flows (2001) ISBN 9780521785570\nUnderstanding Global Crises: An Emerging Paradigm (2014) ISBN 9780262028592\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nSvensson, L.

It started operating in 2008 under Ajtósi Dürer sor but had to move to Újbuda due to property development of the building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building on Ajtósi Dürer sor used to be a Sacré Coeur Girl's School, later functioned as a socialist party school and then was occupied by Eötvös Lorand University. When the university moved out, an Israeli businessman bought the property in 2007. The building and the practice studios that belonged to it were subsequently rented out to Dürer Kert since 2008. From 2014, the club had a five-year contract to rent the space, but had to fight to keep their tenant rights every year, as property developers envisioned the space as a living quarters and an office building. It was also suggested at one point that the property would host the Capital Circus of Budapest. In 2018, the building was acquired by István Garancsi's property development business and Dürer Kert started looking for another place to rent. During the Covid19 pandemic, the club had to close down and eventually had to leave the premises. The building was torn down to give way to a modern office building and apartment block.\nThe club found a new place to rent in Újbuda in the former techno and house club Rio II, which was leased to them by BudaPart Office and Residential Park. The building was remodeled to fit the vibe and profile of Dürer Kert and to harmonize with its surroundings, namely the Kelenföld power station nearby. The new venue has two music halls; one can host 950 spectators, the smaller one is fit for 270 people. The main hall has a panorama window to the Danube, while the second floor hosts an exhibition space, a bar and the backstage. The building is surrounded by a large green space, where an open-air stage is hosted, along with areas for barbecue and a street food court.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tThe former Dürer Kert on Ajtósi Dürer sor\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The pocket borough of Cavan was the subject of an agreement between the Clements and Nesbitt families to share representation equally. From March 1780 to May 1782 he was absent on a voyage to the Far East. He stood down at the 1783 general election to make way for Henry Theophilus Clements, who had been declared not duly elected for County Leitrim.\n\n\n== References ==\nEdith Johnston-Liik, History of the Irish Parliament 1692–1800 (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2002), vol.

        "content": "Walter Halbritter (17 November 1927 – 11 April 2003) was a German civil servant, politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime head of the Office for Prices at the Council of Ministers of the GDR and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED. Additionally, from 1967 to October 1973, he was a candidate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn into a family of agricultural workers on 17 November 1927, in Hoym, Halbritter attended primary school from 1934 to 1942 and underwent administrative training from 1942 to 1944. In 1944, he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and spent time as prisoner of war in British captivity from May to December 1945.\nUpon his return, he worked as a farm laborer and joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1946, and the Free German Youth (FDJ) in 1948. He worked at the Ballenstedt district administration until 1951, afterwards studying at the German Administrative Academy in Forst Zinna, de facto a cadre factory of the SED, from until 1954. He subsequently served as head of the Budget Department of the GDR's Ministry of Finance.\nFrom 1952 to 1957, he pursued distance learning at the Humboldt University and University of Economics in Berlin, earning a degree in economics. Starting from 1954, he worked as a staff member in the Central Committee of the SED, eventually serving as deputy head of its Planning, Finance, and Technical Development Department from 1960 to 1961.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Minister ===\nFrom 1961 to 1963, he was deputy finance minister, then served as deputy chair of the State Planning Commission and chair of the Committee for Labor and Wages until 1965. From December 1965 to November 1989, he was the first and only head of the newly established Office for Prices at the Council of Ministers of the GDR, holding ministerial rank. Additionally, from November 1967 to 1989, he was a member of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.\nHalbritter's office compared consumer prices, for example for basic foods or energy, in the GDR with those in other countries. According to the government's ideas, these were then also established for the internal market. The problem here was the fact that the Price Office, as an intermediate steering body, decoupled the connection between the producers' production costs and the purchasing power of consumers. This led to chaotic conditions, especially in areas where prices had been heavily subsidized and frozen by the state for several decades, for example for food, drinking water, utilities such as electricity and gas, tradesmen's services or fees for public transport, because households did not were more encouraged to consume or consume according to their own possibilities. This resulted in excess demand, which in a market economy would result in a price premium. However, since consumer prices were fixed by the state, this often led to a waste of resources. For example, basic foods were thoughtlessly fed to small animals and the energy provided was used carelessly.\nHalbritter was awarded the Banner of Labor in 1963 and 1969, the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1977 and 1987 (honor clasp), and the Martial Order “For Services to the People and Fatherland” in 1984.\n\n\n=== SED Central Committee ===\nFrom April 1967 (VII. Party Congress) until its collective resignation in December 1989, he was a full member of the Central Committee of the SED. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1967. He was also elected to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED, the de facto highest leadership body in East Germany, as a candidate member, but was not reelected in October 1973, when Erich Honecker instituted a major reshuffle of the Politburo following Walter Ulbricht's death.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nDuring the Wende, from December 1989 to February 1990, he served as Representative of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers for the Central Round Table and for the dissolution of the Office for National Security in the Modrow government, with the rank of state secretary.\nIn this role, he was tasked with preparing talks at the Central Round Table, as well as serving as a liaison to the Office for National Security and the Dissolution Committee of the Ministry for State Security.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nHalbritter passed away in 2003 at the age of 75. He was buried in the cemetery in Seelow.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "LMC X-1 is the first X-ray source detected in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was discovered in 1969, using data from a sounding rocket, launched from the Johnston Atoll on October 29, 1968. LMC X-1 is a persistently luminous X-ray binary.\nIn the 80s Hutchings et al. performed spectroscopic follow-up observations of the optical counterpart and found an orbital period of about 4 days and a secondary mass of about 6 M☉, making the secondary a stellar mass black hole. The orbital period later turned out to be shorter at around 3.9 days. The optical counterpart is also called \"star 32\". The black hole has a mass of around 11 M☉ and the star has a mass of around 32 M☉ and a radius of 17 R☉. With this radius the star nearly fills its Roche lobe and it is predicted that it will encounter its Roche lobe in a few hundred thousand years. Once it reaches its Roche lobe, it will begin rapid and possibly unstable mass transfer to its companion.\nThe X-ray source is surrounded by a nebula, which is the only nebula energized by an X-ray binary. It is suspected that the nebula is a bow shock nebula. The nebula is also detected in radio wavelengths with ATCA imaging. A possible origin of LMC X-1 is the star cluster [NKN2005] N159-O1. Other possible origins are NGC 2077, NGC 2080, NGC 2085 and NGC 2086. In the scenario of N159-O1 being the origin, the progenitor to the black hole would have a mass of about 60 M☉, meaning it was the most massive member of this star cluster.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM33 X-7 is a stellar mass black hole in the Triangulum Galaxy\nCyg X-1 another x-ray binary with a stellar black hole and a massive star\nGaia BH1 first dormant black hole\n\n\n== References ==",

At the age of nine years, he moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2015, after playing well at an academy training tournament a year before. In his second season for the U17s team in 2022–23, the midfielder led the team as captain and set up six goals for his teammates in 12 games in the B-Junioren Bundesliga, in addition to scoring three times himself. He then became a permanent member of the BVB U19 squad in the summer of 2023, as did striker Paris Brunner. The German immediately became a regular in central midfield in the Under 19 Bundesliga. At the end of February 2024, alongside Youssoufa Moukoko and Julien Duranville, he was one of three U20 players in the squad for the Champions League round of 16 first leg against PSV Eindhoven. Earlier that month, Wätjen had already been on the bench for the goalless draw against 1. FC Heidenheim in the men's Bundesliga after scoring seven goals in five consecutive games with the U19s.\nAt the end of March 2024, Wätjen signed a professional contract with Borussia Dortmund valid until June 2028. He was then part of Edin Terzić's squad in other games and won the championship in the western season with the Dortmund A-Youth team. On matchday 32 of the 2023–24 season, Wätjen made his Bundesliga debut for Borussia in the 5–1 home win against FC Augsburg, where he was in the starting eleven and set up Marco Reus' fourth goal.\n\n\n== International career ==\nWätjen first played for Germany at U16 level.

        "content": "Eric Zolov is an American historian, author and academic. He is Professor of History at Stony Brook University where he was the Director of Latin American & Caribbean Studies (2016–19), and as of 2024 he is Director of Undergraduate Studies as of (2020–present). Previously, he taught at Franklin & Marshall College (1998–2011). Zolov is known for his work on the interplay between culture, politics, and international relations in twentieth-century Latin America, particularly during the Cold War era. His first monograph Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture was published in 1999 to positive critical acclaim, and was translated and published in Spanish by Norma Editorial. His book The Last Good Neighbor: Mexico in the Global Sixties (2020, Duke University Press) won the 2021 María Elena Martínez Prize in Mexican History by the Conference on Latin American History (CLAH-AHA). Zolov has been a member of the American Historical Association since 2001.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZolov graduated with a B.A. in history from Colby College in 1987. He studied at the University of Chicago where he graduated with a dual M.A. in International Relations and Latin American Studies in 1990, and a Ph.D. in Latin American History in 1995.\nIn an interview with Perspectives on History, a magazine published by the American Historical Association, Zolov said that he had never been interested in history or good at memorizing places, names or events, and that having Jack D. Foner teach him a social history course in college ignited his interest in the field. He said he was \"hooked by the idea that history offered so much more than knowing “the right answer.”\"\nIn 2021, Zolov's book The Last Good Neighbor: Mexico in the Global Sixties won the María Elena Martínez Prize in Mexican History as the best published book on the history of Mexico published in 2020.\nIn 2022 Zolov and his wife Terri Gordon-Zolov published The Walls of Santiago: Social Revolution and Political Aesthetics in Contemporary Chile (Berghahn Books, 2022). Zolov and Gordon-Zolov embarked on the project of documenting the Estallido Social in Santiago through photographs, interviews, and research while living in Chile on a Fulbright Fellowship. Initially focusing on graffiti and political graphics, their project expanded to include various forms of public art and performances, culminating in a multi-modal approach including a monograph, an exhibit, an interactive map, and a website. They view their work as a form of scholarship-activism, aiming to translate the significance of the uprising and its artistic expressions to broader audiences, contributing to a larger archival consciousness and historical understanding of the events of 2019–20.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nZolov, Eric.

        "content": "Mesobuthus vesiculatus is a species of scorpion in the family Buthidae. It is primarily located in Iran, ranging from the Caucaso-Iranian Highlands to Anatolian-Iranian Desert (90% of Iran). The males and females are of a modest in size, reaching lengths of 60 mm or approximately 2.4 inches. M. vesiculatus is known to have a yellowish to brownish yellow coloration with brownish segments located at or near tergite, sclerotized plate formed near dorsal portion of an arthropod, and dark reticulations on the basal half. Males in general have more pectines, comb-like teeth, 26-29 than females 20–22.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\n=== Carapace ===\nAnterior of the carapace is virtually smooth, with slight emarginates. The carinae are seen to be more pronounced in males and granular in both genders. However, the posterior median carinae are small with granules on the dorsal edge of the carapace. The dorsal side of the metasomal segments are all temperately developed. Three pairs of lateral eyes are located on each side, and the median eyes are separated, from one another, by 2 ocular diameters.\n\n\n=== Telson ===\nThe telson is globular in shape, characteristic of the scorpions in the family Buthidae, but appears more swollen with short, small, and hooked aculeus (A. Karatas, 2012).\n\n\n=== Chelicerae ===\nIt has two reduced denticles at base of the ventral side of its movable finger.\n\n\n=== Legs ===\nAll legs have spurs that are prolateral and retro lateral, and all telotarsi have two rows of bristles ventrally and several setae dorsally. The dactyl is small and blunt, while the ungues short, stout, and weakly curved (A. Karatas, 2012). Legs III and IV contain strong tibial spurs.\n\n\n=== Hemi spermatophore ===\nThese are typical for this genus and family of scorpion. The outer and interior lobe of the truncal flexure are thick at the base. There are four distinct lobes with the interior lobe being the largest in size.\n\n\n=== Differentiation of M. vesiculatus from other scorpions in family Buthidae ===\nM. Vesiculatus is similar to Sassanidotus gracillis because they both have a large telson and narrow metasoma but M. Vesiculatus is shown to have three granules near the terminal granule on the pedipalp movable finger. M. Vesiculatus also has very pronounced carapacial and metasomal carination, and its metasomal segment are seen to be larger than that of Olivierus caucasicus and smaller than that of M. eupeus. M. Vesiculatus is different than these three other species in that its median eyes are much larger, its vesicle and aculeus is smaller, and it has a stouter carination on its pedipalp.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mesobuthus zarudnyi, a scorpion species within the Buthidae family, was formally documented in Azerbaijan in 2022, its discovery was attributed to the region of the Absheron peninsula. This species is named in honor of Nikolai Zarudny (1859–1919), a distinguished Russian zoologist and explorer renowned for his extensive collection of scorpion specimens in Persia (modern-day Iran) from 1896 to 1904, which greatly contributed to the field of zoology.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe chelicerae display a yellow coloration, either lacking or exhibiting minimal reticulation. Both the pedipalps and metasoma are sparsely covered in fine hairs. The carapace and tergites appear reddish-brown, strongly marked with black pigmentation. Meanwhile, the metasoma, telson, pedipalps, and legs range from yellowish to reddish-brown, with only a portion of metasomal segment V being black. The femur of the pedipalp typically features 4–5 granulated carinae, while the patella usually bears 8 smooth carinae. Notably, the chela lacks carinae. The movable fingers of the pedipalps possess 11–12 cutting rows of denticles and 5 terminal denticles.\nThe  species is differentiated morphologically from both other species known from Azerbaijan by having the anal lobe divided into two parts. Both Mesobuthus eupeus and M. persicus have anal lobe divided into three parts.\nAdults range in length from 40–49 mm (1.6–1.9 in) for males to 42–58 mm (1.7–2.3 in) for females. Males typically exhibit more twist in their proximal fingers compared to females. The ratio of length to width in the pedipalp chela is between 3.2 and 3.4 for males and between 3.7 and 3.8 for females. The number of pectinal teeth is 25 in males and ranges from 17 to 22 in females.\n\n\n== References ==",

They are citizens of pre-Islamic Yemen, whom were given divine punishments for their misdeeds and rejection of the divine messengers sent by God.\n\n\n== Islamic literature ==\nThe word Tubba' was in fact a title which was used by the Himyarites to refer to their rulers. The identify of the Tubba' here is unknown, however scholars including Ibn Kathir, Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Hisham, Ibn al-Kalbi and Tabari have identified him as the Himyarite king Abu Karib. Ibn al-Jawzi also has a narration which cites the Tubba' as being Malikikarib Yuhamin, Abu Karib's father and predecessor.\nThere is a Hadith of disputed authenticity, which affirms that Tubba' was a believer in a \"correct\" faith that preceded Islam. However, another narration states that it was not known whether Tubba' was accursed or not. Arab traditions cite that Tubba' converted to Judaism after he was warned by two rabbis at Medina to stay away from the city, as a Prophet would migrate there in future.\n\n\n== Qur'anic references ==\nThe people of Tubba' are mentioned twice in the Qu'ran:\n\n۝ Are they better or the people of Tubba' and those who went before them? We destroyed them [for] indeed, they were a criminal people.\n۝ And the companions of the thicket and the people of Tubba'. All denied the messengers, so My threat was justly fulfilled.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPharaoh in the Qu'ran\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dinkar Shivram Salvi (1904–1980), popularly known as Dada Salvi was an Indian actor who worked in Marathi and Hindi films.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDada Salvi was born in Phansop, Ratnagiri district, and began his career in entertainment by actively participating in various programs in his village, including acting in dramas. The playwright Tipnis brought him to Mumbai, where he secured a position at the Excelcior Film Company managed by Sheth Vazir Ahijee. Salvi's educational background made him an ideal candidate for film work, leading to his employment at a monthly salary of 25 rupees. He made his acting debut in the first silent film Khun-e-Nahak (1928). Impressed by his performance, Imperial Film Company invited him to join them, where he directed and acted in several silent films such as Madanmanjari, Indira B.A., Bholashikar, Cinema Girl, Hamara Hindustan, Raat Ki Baat, and Khuda Ki Shaan. Additionally, he worked in Paramount Film Company's Poliadi Pehalwan, directed by Jayant Desai.\nSalvi played a significant role in the Marathi film industry, notably in the first talkie film Alam Ara, and continued to act in films like Aut Ghatkayacha Raja, Bhakt Pralhad, Chatrapati Sambhaji, and Thakasen Rajput under the banner Saraswati Cinetone. He gained recognition for his portrayal of Kalusha Kabjee in Chatrapati Sambhaji. Hans Chitra acknowledged his talent and offered him roles in Kolhapur, where he delivered impressive performances.\nIn 1937, Salvi ventured into talkies with Premveer, marking the beginning of his collaboration with Master Vinayak. Their partnership led to memorable films such as Brahmachari, where he portrayed the father of the lead actress. He showcased his versatility with roles ranging from a drunkard in Brandy Ki Bottle, a loving father in Devta and a professor in Ardhangi.\nAs Hans Pictures evolved into Navayug Films, Salvi continued to contribute to the industry with films like Sangam, Pahili Mangalagaur, and Tujhach. His acting prowess remained unmatched, and he played the lead role of Barrister Manohar in Majh Bal for Prabhat Films after Vinayak's departure. His performances in films like Chimukla Sansar, Gajabha, Badi Maa, and Subhadra further solidified his reputation as a versatile actor.\nAfter Vinayak's demise in 1947, Salvi continued to act in films like Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani, Tadveer, and Maharana Pratap. Despite declining offers to act in Ramshastri for Prabhat Films, he portrayed the antagonist in Jivacha Sakha for Mangal Pictures, receiving acclaim for his performance. Salvi's contribution to Marathi cinema was significant, with notable roles in films such as Patalacha Por, Vadal, Kanchanganga, Kuldaivat, Sangte Aika, Shikleli Bayko, Antaricha Diwa, Umaj Padel Tar, and Kanyadan, where his portrayal of a father-in-law resonated with audiences.\nDuring his tenure at Imperial Film Company, Salvi married actress Sakubai. His journey in the film industry left a lasting impact, showcasing his talent and versatility as an actor.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nSource: Maharashtra Nayak\n\nKhoon-E-Nahak\nMadanmanjiri\nIndira B.

His parents then quickly moved to Nantes. The Second World War had dramatic consequences for his family, who had to take refuge in hiding in the Massif Central in 1941. His mother's entire family was exterminated. Returning to Nantes in 1945, he resumed his studies at the Lycée Jules Verne and then at the Lycée Clemenceau, and he entered, in parallel with his school studies, the Conservatoire d'art dramatique de Nantes, where he studied under the direction of Jacques Couturier. He graduated in 1954, without a prize but with a medal for diction. He then moved to Paris, where he studied literature, obtaining a master's degree in modern literature, and entered the École supérieure de Journalisme. He found an internship at Agence France Presse but his passions remained theater and writing. At that time, he wrote two plays that were never performed.\nA few months after his marriage to Danielle Lévy, in 1957, he was sent to military service for 28 months, 14 of which were in Algeria.\nReturning to Paris in 1960, he began a career as a journalist, first at Agence France Presse, then for an economic newspaper for three years, then for magazines. At the same time, he made a name for himself in 1963 as a playwright, writing for radio and television, and also for the stage, under the pen name Victor Haïm. He borrowed his father's middle name, Joseph Haïm Lévy. He ended his journalistic career in 1977, His first success was in 1963 with his play The Skin of the Carnivore, which was created by Pierre Valde, a professor at the Cours Dullin, and, in particular, Gérard Desarthe, and Michelle Marquais. The play will be performed in more than twenty countries. His career was then launched in France and abroad - his works were translated into fifteen languages. In 1966, his play Die Singing and, a year later, Bladed Weapon were new successes. From then on, he was supported by the Avant-Scène publishing house, which published his new works in their magazine and in the Collection des Quatre-Vents.\nHe diversified in 1970 by writing a play for puppets, an opera libretto and a ballet-comedy. From 1982 onwards, he wrote screenplays, his first work being Entre Chats et Loups, followed by Les Incorrigibles (1977), Ja Peur (1994), Noces Cruelles (1996). In addition, he became a drama teacher in 1983, at the Théâtre de L'Ombre, then at the Cours Florent. He held this position until 1991. In 1992, he worked at the Regional School of Actors in Cannes, and two years later, at the Department of Culture and Communication at the University of Évry. The French Theatre Centre of UNESCO called on him to fill the post of secretary.\nFrom 1976 onwards, he acted in his own plays. Her first role was in his play Isaac and the Midwife.\n\n\n== Awards and accolades ==\nIn 2003, he was awarded the Molière Award for his work Stage Games (Jeux de Scène).

        "content": "Maruzensky (Japanese: マルゼンスキー; May 19, 1974 - August 21, 1997) was an undefeated Japanese thoroughbred racehorse.\nHis racing career was extremely successful, winning all of the races he entered, including the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes which he had won with a massive gap, earning the nickname \"Supercar\" in the process. However, as horses brought over from abroad at the time were barred from entering any of the Triple Crown races, the horse was unable to enter in such races.\nAs a stallion, he was also successful, producing Derby winner Sakura Chiyono O, as well as 3 other Grade I winners, among others.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMaruzensky's dam, Shill, by Buckpasser, was bought at the Keeneland Sales in the Autumn of 1973 by Zenkichi Hashimoto, father of future olympist and Diet member Seiko Hashimoto. Hashimoto, while having owned cows in his ranch, was relatively new to the world of owning racehorses, when he was on a business trip from Japan. There, he also met the horse's future trainer, Shigehiko Hongo.\nAt the auction, Hashimoto was told by his interpretor that, given her mare line, as well as the fact the horse was pregnant with a foal of Nijinsky, it was expected that the horse would bid at a high price. Feeling both insulted by the interpretor for his career involving  and a desire to buy Shill for himself, he wound up buying the horse for 30 million US Dollars, which would have amounted to about 90 million Japanese yen at the time.\nAfter being shipped to Japan, Shill foaled a colt on May 19, 1974. Hashimoto planned to give the Maruzen yagō to the horse, and went with \"Maruzensky\" as the foal was a colt, rather than \"Miss Maruzen\" had the foal had been a filly.\nTwo years later, the horse entered Hongo's stable in July 1976.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 1976: Two year old season ===\nMaruzensky's maiden race was on October 9, with Seiichi Nakanowatari as his jockey. There, the horse handily beat the other horses, finishing the race with more than 2 seconds of gap against the 2nd place. Maruzensky also won his next race, an allowance race, where he finished the race with a 9 length gap between him and the 2nd place.\nThe horse was then entered to the Fuchu Sansai Stakes, an open race, on November 21. The race was contested by only 5 runners, including Hokkaido Sansai Stakes winner Hishi Speed, who had almost caught up to Maruzensky in the race due to Nakanowatari not anticipating any other horse to catch up to him, and had let the horse run slowly. Maruzensky and Hishi Speed ran neck and neck, resulting in a photo finish which concluded that Maruzensky beat the latter by a nose.\nOn December 12, the horse was entered in to the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. There, the horse took the lead early on, and ran the front of the pack, finishing the race with a 13 length lead. His time, 1:34.4, was a course record that would not be broken for 14 years until Lindo Shaver broke it in 1990. After the race, Nakanowatari commented that \"he couldn't even hear the footsteps of the other horses\" past the 3rd corner. Hishi Speed's jockey, Futoshi Kojima, commented \"That thing is a monster... To be honest, I'm glad I won't have to deal with [Maruzensky] for a while\" regarding the winner of the race.\nFor his performances, he was awarded the Yushun Sho Saiyushu Sansai Boba that year.\n\n\n=== 1977: Three year old season ===\nMaruzensky started off the season with an open race held at Chukyo Racecourse with the intention of running in the Kisaragi Sho. However, other trainers feared losing to the undefeated horse, and avoided entering the race. The open race was almost canceled were it not for Masatoshi Hattori entering two of his horses under his training. Maruzensky ultimately won the race by a 2 and a half length lead. After this win, however, Maruzensky fractured his shin, and was forced to take a three months long break.\nMaruzensky returned to racing that May, and won another open race with a 7 length lead, but the horse was unable to enter the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) as horses brought over from abroad, including as fetuses at the time, were barred from running in a Triple Crown race. Nakanowatari reportedly begged to have the horse enter the race, pleading \"Let [Maruzensky] enter the Japanese Derby. I don't care if the horse starts from the furthest outside. We won't interfere the other horses. We don't need the prize money. We just want to see how the horse would do\". Hashimoto planned to go to court over this, but ultimately the decision was unchanged. Maruzensky being barred from entering the Derby caused controversy within the horse racing circle of Japan, with the official JRA magazine, Yushun, even holding a discussion panel on its September 1977 issue.\nOn June 26, Maruzensky was entered in to the Nihon Tampa Sho, where nearly 80,000 people attended to see the horse run. Maruzensky faced off the NHK Hai and future Kikka Sho winner Press Toko, but by far the most favored to win was Maruzensky, whose parimutuel odds was consistently at 1.0. At the race, Maruzensky quickly took the lead and had already gained a 6 to 7 length lead by the first corner. Howeer, after passing the third corner the horse suddenly lost momentum and was almost passed by Inter Spencer. Maruzensky however, quickly regained the lead and ultimately finished the race with a 7 lengths lead. Nakanowatari later commented that \"the track was bad that day, so I tried to run on the outside to keep the horse safe. Then Inter Spencer came up and the horse became aloof\".\nAfter this race, Maruzenski is moved to Hokkaido to run in a couple of races at Sapporo and Hakodate before running a race in Autumn before the Arima Kinen. He was subsequently entered in to the Tankyori Stakes at Sapporo. Initially, there were plans of Tosho Boy running in that race alongside Maruzensky. However, that plan never materialized, and ultimately that race was run with only 5 runners. In the race, a filly named Yoshio Kazan took the lead and made Maruzensky run from the 2nd of the pack, which was a first for the horse. However, the horse gradually took over the lead and ultimately won the race at a record of 1:10.1.\nThe horse was then moved to Hakodate. However, during training, Maruzensky had developed tendonitis, partly due to hitting the railings there. The horse spent all Autumn trying to cure the symptom, but had symptoms showing again when the horse was training for Arima in December. While the tendonitis itself was relatively light, both Hashimoto and Hongo agreed to retire the horse at that point as the only major races the horse could have entered by that point was either the Arima and Takarazuka.\nA retirement ceremony was held at Tokyo Racecourse on January 15, 1978.\n\n\n== Racing form ==\nThe following racing form is based on information available on JBIS and netkeiba.\n\n\"R\" in the chart and the time written in red indicates the horse finished in record time.\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nUpon retirement, Maruzensky was sent to the Toyosato Stallion Center in Monbetsu, Hokkaido to stand stud there. As a stallion, Maruzensky was a successful sire, producing Kikka Sho winner Horisky as one of his first crops, as well as Derby winner Sakura Chiyono O, Takarazuka winner Suzuka Koban, and Kikka Sho winner Leo Durban.\nMaruzensky was also successful as a broodmare sire, giving birth to dams of two Derby winners, Winning Ticket and Special Week, as well as Rice Shower, Mejiro Bright, and Primo Ordine among other Grade I winners.\nMaruzensky passed away on August 21, 1997, after sufering a heart attack. A funeral was held three days later on August 24, attended by many people as well as his dam, who was still alive at the time, before being buried inside the Hashimoto Bokujou property.\n\n\n=== Notable progeny ===\nBelow data is based on JBIS Stallion Reports.\nc = colt, f = filly\nbold = grade 1 stakes\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\nMaruzensky was inbred 4x4 to Menow, and 5x5 to both Bull Dog and Blue Larkspur, meaning that these horses will appear in the 4th or 5th generations reslectively.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of leading Thoroughbred racehorses",

He was a prominent figure in the Nigeria's biotechnology policy formulation and was the Director General and Chief Executive Officer of National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) for two terms, from 2005 - 2013.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBamidele Solomon was born in 1955 in Idofin-Isanlu, Kwara State (now in Kogi State). He started his secondary education at ECWA Secondary School, Mopa, Kogi State, where he studied from 1968 to 1972 before transferring to Federal Government College, Sokoto in 1973, graduating with an O’Level certificate in 1974. In 1975, he enrolled at Kansas State University as a Scholar of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (scholarship). He received  a Post-graduate Fellowship from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Kansas State University where he concluded his studies with a PhD in chemical and biochemical engineering in 1983.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSolomon started his academic career in 1980 as a temporary instructor at Kansas State University and served there until 1983, when he returned to Nigeria. Following his return, he participated in the mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), passing out in 1984. He taught chemical engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, from 1984 to 1994 and served as Deputy Dean, Faculty of Technology. During this period, he worked in other institutions, including at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, where he was an associate lecturer in biochemical engineering (genetic engineering) from 1989 to 1992.\nIn 1992, Solomon received a two-year equipment grant of DM44,000.00 as a research fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to conduct research in process modeling and parameter estimation at GBF (National Institute for Biotechnology), Braunschweig, Germany. He was awarded a research grant of $10,600.00 by the International Foundation for Science, Sweden, (1994). In 1995, Solomon was awarded a Fellowship by the South African Government Research Council to conduct preliminary fermentation runs on genetically engineered yeasts at the University of Stellenbosch. He joined Ladoke Akintola University of Technology as an associate lecturer in chemical engineering in 1995 and rose to the rank of Head of Department of Chemical Engineering in 2000 and served in this position until 2004.\nHe was a consultant with several private and public organisations including Mobil Producing Nigeria, NNPC, International Brewery Limited, Chevron, Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers, and federal ministries of Solid Minerals, Environment, and Science and Technology. He was a prominent figure in the advocacy for the passage of the Biosafety bill which established the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA). Solomon served as Director General and Chief Executive Officer of National Biotechnology Development Agency for two terms from 2005 – 2013.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nStatistical Estimation of Yield and Maintenance Parameters Associated with Microbial Growth\nCellulase Production by Aspergillus flavus Linn Isolate NSPR 101 fermented in sawdust, bagasse and corncob\nNational Biotechnology Status Survey, 2008\nCultivation of Selected Tropical Edible Mushroom: A Hands-on Manual\nProperties of Biodiesel Feedstock as an Effective Ecofuel Source and Their Challenges\nBiomass Yields and Maintenance Requirements for growth on Carbohydrates\nDevelopment of Malt for the Nigerian Brewing Industries: Malting of Grain Sorghum\nMicrobial Conversion of Maize and Sorghum Dusts to High Protein Food\nEvaluation of Microbial Systems for Bioremediation of Petroleum Refinery Effluents in Nigeria\nUtilization of Airlift Fermenters in the Mass Propagation of Pseudomonas and Aureobasidium Species for the Bioremediation of Crude Oil Polluted Aquatic Environments\nPhysicochemical Characterization of Delonox Regia Oil and Heterogeneous Catalyst Synthesis from the Husk for Biodiesel Production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Design Approach\nOptimization of process variables for microbial degradation of phenol by binary mixed culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens using response surface methodology\nInfluencing Politicians and Policy Makers to Pave Way for a Viable Biotechnology Sector: A Case Study of the Nigerian Biosafety Bill Drafting, Passage, Experiences and Lessons Learnt” in Biotechnology for Africa\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ellinor Gertrude Walker  (9 April 1893 – 7 November 1990) was an Australian kindergarten teacher and women's rights activist. She wrote plays and poems and is credited with drafting The Guardianship of Infants Act passed in 1940 in South Australia.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWalker was born in 1893 in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. In 1902 she moved with her family to Adelaide, where she was educated at the Wilderness School and Norwood High School.\nIn 1916 she enrolled at the Adelaide Kindergarten Training College (one source says 1917). The college was led by Lillian Daphne de Lissa who was headhunted in early 1917 to lead a similar college in Britain. de Lissa said that she would try to find a replacement for herself. Walker became the principal of the Halifax Street Free Kindergarten which gave assistance to the poor mothers of the area.\nIn 1919 the flu pandemic was killing many people around the world. Walker did not die but she did catch the disease and she had to be place in quarantine as she began a long recovery. After her recovery, Walker opened and ran Greenways, a school for twenty children aged 3 to 8 based in her home based on the Montessori method for 24 years. In the later afternoon she had other activities for herself. She would read the accounts of parlimentary debates and write letters where she could assist. She also wrote plays and one was performed in Adelaide in May 1933 at the Australian Federation of Women Voters conference. The play was called The Spring of Power and concerned how women had gained the vote. Her next play, Heritage: A Pageant of South Australia, was featured in the celebration of South Australia's bicentenary and it ran for ten sell-out performances. Her writing also included poetry and The silver wing and other poems was published in 1939.\n\nIn 1940 The Guardianship of Infants Act was passed by the South Australia parliament. This act was almost entirely due to Walker. It was her research over eight years that enabled her to draft the text. Her draft was checked by Roma Mitchell and with one amendment it was adopted by the government as part of that year's legislation.\nShe joined the Women's Non-Party Political Association and remained an active member for 65 years. After the war she and the association were advocates for the League of Nations.\nWalker was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1971 Birthday Honours for service to the community.\nWalker died in Norwood, South Australia in 1990. Ellinor Walker Street, in the Canberra suburb of Franklin, is named in her honour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

It is located 9 km north of Ribe, 10 km south of Bramming and 20 km southeast of Esbjerg, just north of the Kongeå and just east of the Danish national road 11.\n\nGredstedbro Church was inaugurared in 1925 as an affiliated church in Jernved Parish. The parish church, Jernved Church, is located in the village of Jernved 3 km northeast of Gredstedbro.\nWhen the river Kongeå was straightened out by Gredstedbro in 1945, the digger came across three pieces of hard oak. At the time it was belived that it was the remains of an old bridge, but almost twenty years later it was discovered that it was the remains of a ship from the Iron Age, the so-called Gredstedbro ship (Danish: Gredstedbroskibet).\n\n\n== References ==",

The MNDA eventually united with another breakaway MNLA faction led by Nai Pan Nyunt on November 29, 2001, to form the Monland Restoration Army.\nInitially, the MRA/HRP alliance engaged in numerous clashes with the SPDC and MNLA in early 2002. However, the strength of the splinter groups deteriorated by 2003 as most members defected back to the MNLA.\nAfter the MNLA ended their ceasefire with the SPDC in September 2010, both the MNDA and the MRA reunited.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dobong A (Korean: 도봉구 갑) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Dobong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 136,836 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Dobong A has more often voted for centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency and is thus considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party. \nShin Oh-chul of the right-wing New Democratic Republican Party was the first member to represent the constituency, having won with only 33.27% of the vote. Shin unsuccessfully ran for re-election and was succeeded Yoo Ihn-tae of the centre-left Democratic Party. In the following election held in 1996, Kim Geun-tae of the centrist liberal National Congress for New Politics won the seat with 38.85% of the vote, narrowly beating out Yang Kyung-ja of the centre-right Grand National Party. Kim won re-election in 2000 and 2004 and went on to serve as Minister of Health and Welfare under President Roh Moo-hyun. Kim narrowly lost re-election in 2008 to Shin Ji-ho of the Grand National Party. Shin was not re-nominated for the 2012 election, after losing to Yoo Kyung-hee in the Saenuri Party's primary for the constituency. In the general election, Yoo Kyung-hee faced In Jae-keun, the spouse of former representative Kim Geun-tae who had passed away in 2011. In Jae-keun emerged victorious, securing 58.46% of the vote. In won re-election in 2016 and 2020, garnering 60.1% and 54.2% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, incumbent In Jae-keun announced that she would not be standing for re-election in Dobong A. On February 23, 2024, the Democratic Party nominated former YTN anchor Ahn Gwi-ryeong as the party's candidate for Dobong A. Despite the constituency's historical preference for candidates from the Democratic Party and predecessor parties, Ahn narrowly lost to Kim Jae-sub of the conservative People Power Party. Kim Jae-sub was one of only three People Power Party candidates to win in Seoul constituencies north of the Han River.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Ssangmun 1-dong, Ssangmun 3-dong, and Chang-dong. It is bordered by Dobong B to the north, Gangbuk A to the south and west, Nowon A to the east, and Nowon B to the northeast.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tales from the Austin Motel is an album by the American musician Debbie Davies, released in 1999. Davies supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was recorded in Austin, Texas, over the course of two weeks in January 1999; its title refers to the motel where Davies stayed. Davies was backed by the Double Trouble musicians Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon. She was inspired by the Austin bluesman W. C. Clark. Davies wrote or cowrote seven of the songs. \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" is a cover of the Willie Dixon song. \"Atras de Tus Ojos (Behind Your Eyes)\" is an instrumental.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Chicago Tribune concluded that \"neither her deep, strong voice nor her barrage of slide solos distinguishes Davies from dozens of similar blues singer-guitarists. CMJ New Music Report called Tales from the Austin Motel a \"landmark of an album [that] is certainly one of the best blues records of 1999.\" The Independent said that the \"mostly enjoyable set of shuffles evokes the Texas tradition.\" The Telegram & Gazette wrote that \"a fine balance is struck between the bawdy and the mournful.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer determined that \"her economical guitar solos have plenty of bite.\"\nAllMusic noted that \"some may quibble that the recording is a little too crystal clear to really capture the nasty Austin sound they strive to achieve, but the trio does have a dynamic interplay.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edmone Roffael (1939–2021) was a Palestinian-German chemist and wood scientist, and former professor at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, who made noteworthy contributions to clarifying the release of formaldehyde from particleboard and MDF products, and its emission reduction. \nRoffael was also an elected fellow of the International Academy of Wood Science.\nFrom 1993 to 2005, Roffael served as the head of the Department of Wood Chemistry and Wood Technology at the Institute of Wood Biology and Wood Technology, Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nEdmone Roffael was born on December 31, 1939, in Tulkarm, Palestine. Initially, he studied chemistry in Egypt at University of Alexandria and Cairo University, as well as at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. \nAfter completing his studies, he obtained a Ph.D. in cellulose chemistry from TU Darmstadt in 1968, with a dissertation titled \"X-ray and infrared investigations on the orderliness of cellulose.\" Subsequently, he worked from 1970 to 1993 at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research in Braunschweig, where he was engaged in technological wood research, cooperating also with the-then director, Dr. Rainer Marutzky. His work focus soon became various particleboard materials and their production using synthetic resins, mostly formaldehyde-based resins (UF, MUF, PF). Regarding this topic, Roffael authored his habilitation thesis, titled \"Possibilities of gluing wood particles with phenol-formaldehyde resins and sulfite liquor,\" which resulted in his habilitation at the Faculty of Forestry at the Georg-August University of Göttingen in 1976 and granted him the teaching qualification (venia legendi) for the subject of \"Wood Chemistry.\"\nBeginning in 1981, Roffael taught as an adjunct professor at the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Göttingen. In 1993, he accepted the appointment to the Chair of Wood Science at Goettingen University. In the following years, he established the Wood Chemistry Department at the Institute of Forest Utilization, and in 1997, the entire institution was renamed to as \"Institute of Wood Biology and Wood Technology\".\nRoffael gained international recognition primarily through his contributions to formaldehyde research. He had focused his scientific attention on this issue publishing the seminal work \"Die Formaldehyd-Abgabe von Spanplatten und anderen Werkstoffen\" in 1982. However, it was only in the years following that the topic garnered widespread public attention, especially due to serious concerns about the potential health risks and the hazards for the public health. That work was updated and translated into Russian (1991) and English (1993). The methods and devices for measuring the then-found carcinogenic formaldehyde emissions from materials, which Roffael co-developed, were the basis for the development of the German (DIN) and European (EN) standards, guidelines, and regulations. Roffael continuously sought ways to minimize the off-gassing of these substances. He also conducted research on other so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from raw wood and glued wood products. Roffael was also heavily involved in the development of tannin-bonded particleboard panels. \nHe held numerous patents. In addition, more than 20 doctoral theses and more than 40 D.Sc. and M.Sc. theses were performed under his scientific guidance. Roffael was very active in numerous committees and associations, served for the former German Society for Wood Research (DGfH e.V.) in several expert committees. In addition, he was regular member of the Euro Wood Network, the United Nations Environment Programme Working Group, the Zellcheming Association and the Cellulose-Chemists-Club Darmstadt. He also participated as a member in the editorial boards of the estemmed wood-related journals, Holzforschung and European Journal of Wood and Wood Products.\nEven after his retirement in 2005, he continued to be active in scientific research at Goettingen University, coordinating various research projects. In 2017, he published the book \"Formaldehyde in Nature, Wood and Wood Materials\", both in German and English.\nEdmone Roffael died in Braunschweig in January 2021.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nDuring his career, Roffael published his research findings primarily in journals such as WKI-Mitteilungen, Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff, Holz-Zentralblatt, and Das Papier. By 2019, he had authored over 900 scientific and technical publications of any kind.\nHis research work enjoyed a worldwide recognition. His various research and consulting activities took him to Egypt, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Greece, Canada, Malaysia, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, and the USA.\nIn 1988, Roffael, along with his fellows Marutzky and Mehlhorn, were awarded by the International Association iVTH for their research work on the topic \"Investigations on the formaldehyde emissions from wood-based materials and other materials, and the evelopment of methods to reduce formaldehyde emission potential.\"\nOn the occasion of his 65th birthday, the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology at the University of Göttingen honored him on April 21, 2005, with a symposium on \"Wood Industry and Wood Products in Transition.\" Approximately 120 participants from academia and industry gathered in the auditorium at Wilhelmsplatz to celebrate. \nIn October 2023, a meta-research carried out by John Ioannidis et al. at Stanford University, included Edmone Roffael  in Elsevier Data 2022, where he was ranked at the top 2% of researchers in wood science (forestry – materials), having a composite index of 3.0892.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"Röntgen- und Infrarotuntersuchungen über den Ordnungszustand der Cellulose\" (X-ray and Infrared Studies on the Orderliness of Cellulose), dissertation, Darmstadt 1968\n\"Möglichkeiten der Verleimung von Holzspänen mit Phenolformaldehydharzen und Sulfitablauge\" (Possibilities of Gluing Wood Particles with Phenol-Formaldehyde Resins and Sulfite Liquor), habilitation thesis, Göttingen 1975/1976\n\"Beiträge zur Verwendung von alkalischen Phenolformaldehyharzen [Phenolformaldehydharzen] und Ligninsulfonaten bei der Verleimung von Holzspänen\" (Contributions to the Use of Alkaline Phenol-Formaldehyde Resins and Lignosulfonates in Gluing Wood Particles), WKI-Bericht No. 8, Braunschweig 1976\n\"Die Formaldehyd-Abgabe von Spanplatten und anderen Werkstoffen\" (Formaldehyde Emissions from Particleboard and Other Materials), Stuttgart 1982 (ISBN 3-87181-301-X; Russian translation 1991, English translation 1993)\nEdited with Rainer Grießhammer: \"Verwendung von Durchforstungsholz und Altpapier zur Papierherstellung unter Berücksichtigung forstwirtschaftlicher Belange\" (Use of Thinned Wood and Waste Paper in Papermaking, Considering Forestry Aspects), Luft, Boden, Abfall (Issue 37), Stuttgart 1995\nCo-author: \"Umweltschutz in der Holzwerkstoffindustrie.

Its inaugural competition was held in 2024. \n\n\n== Format ==\nThe European Cup has an experimental format compared to typical rhythmic gymnastics competitions. It is open to senior and junior individual gymnasts and seniors groups representing any FIG-affiliated federation.\n\n\n=== Senior individuals ===\nOne or two gymnasts can compete per federation, and they must present 4 to 8 routines between them in the qualification round. The 16 highest-ranked gymnasts from the qualification round advance to a new 'cross battle' format. The cross battles consist of four bracketed rounds of competition where two gymnasts perform with the same apparatus and the gymnast with the higher score advances to the next round. There are also finals for each apparatus, competed by the top 8 highest-scoring individuals (with a maximum of one per federation) for that apparatus during the qualification round.\n\n\n=== Senior groups ===\nGroups perform both exercises in the qualification round, which determines the all-around standings. The top 8 highest-scoring groups for each exercise compete in the apparatus finals.\n\n\n=== Junior individuals ===\nOne to four gymnasts may be entered per federation, and they perform four routines between them in the qualifying round. Countries with more than one entrant participate in the team competition; the scores of each gymnast representing a federation are added together to produce the team score. There are also finals for each apparatus, competed by the top 8 highest-scoring individuals (with a maximum of one per federation) for that apparatus during the qualification round.\n\n\n== Editions ==\n\n\n== See ==\nEuropean Cup in Rhythmic Gymnastics (1989-1995)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Ely Subway is a disused pedestrian tunnel beneath the mouth of the River Ely in South Wales. \nOpened in 1900, it provided a direct connection between Penarth Dock and Grangetown until its closure in 1963.\n\n\n== History ==\nPenarth Dock opened in 1865 on the southern edge of Cardiff Bay, at the mouth of the Ely. However, the nearest crossing over the river was a road bridge nearly a mile upstream at Llandough. The operators of the dock, the Taff Vale Railway Company, introduced a chain ferry across to the northern bank of the Ely as a shortcut for both their workers (many of whom lived in Grangetown) and members of the public. However, the ferry was unable to run in bad weather—even sinking twice during storms—and as the docks continued to develop in importance a permanent crossing was considered necessary.\nThe company submitted a bill to Parliament in 1896 seeking permission for a number of new works, one of which was a tunnel beneath the river to replace the ferry. Construction began in July 1897 on a subway designed by George Sibbering, the company's chief engineer, with works overseen by Thomas Taylor, a contractor from Pontypridd. The ramped entrances at either end were dug by hand but the majority of the route—325 yards of the subway's total length of 400 yards—was tunneled with a Greathead shield, of the same design used for the Central London Railway. The northern entrance was located at the southern end of Ferry Road in Grangetown (next to some large petroleum storage tanks owned by the Bear Creek Oil Company), while the southern entrance was next to the dockside Mission Church.\nThe tunneling process was slow and difficult. The ground was largely a loose mixture of mud, gravel, and clay, and the cast-iron tunnel—only 11 feet below the river bed at its deepest point—was subjected to intense differentials in pressure between high and low tides in the bay above. The tunnel flooded twice during construction, in November 1897 and December 1898, although workers were able to evacuate both times without any loss of life. Tunneling finished on 25 September 1899, and a ceremony was held to mark the subway's official opening on 14 May 1900. The total cost of construction was between £25,000 and £26,000. \nThe subway had a diameter of 10 feet 6 inches, with a usable footpath 6 feet wide, and 7 feet 6 inches of headroom. Each side of the tunnel ramped downwards relatively steeply from the entrances, with a gradient of 1 in 7, until meeting in the middle. The interior was painted with a mixture of white enamel and granulated cork to prevent condensation, and lit with electric bulbs. Toll keepers oversaw turnstiles at either entrance, charging pedestrians a penny for entry, cyclists two pence, and prams four pence; horses also reportedly used the subway. It also carried gas and water pipes, and hydraulic lines for coal-loading machinery in the docks, while water leaking in from outside the tunnel was pumped away through drains in the floor. A burst pipe on 4 August 1902 caused a flood and led to the subway's temporary closure.\nThe subway was closed in 1936 as part of the wider closure of Penarth Dock, and the toll keepers were removed, but it was reopened and repurposed as an air raid shelter during the Second World War when the docks were requisitioned for the U.S. Navy.\nAfter the war the subway remained accessible to the public but increasingly fell into disrepair, and it gained a reputation for vandalism and petty crime. It was eventually closed and boarded up in 1963 as part of the wider decommissioning of Penarth Dock; the entrances were then bricked up in 1965. It continued to be used as a conduit for power cables by the South Wales Electricity Board until 1976, when part of the Penarth entrance was demolished and some of the cast iron tunnel sections were removed.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nThe demolished southern entrance was sealed over in the 1980s as part of the redevelopment of Penarth Dock into Penarth Marina—the site is now Plas Pamir, a residential road. The bricked-up northern entrance is located within the grounds of Cardiff Bay Yacht Club.\nThe tunnel is not actively maintained, but (other than the damage to the southern entrance) remains intact. It was inspected in 1991 during the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage and found to be in good condition. However, renovating and reopening it was ultimately not pursued in favour of building Pont Y Werin—a brand new footbridge around half a kilometre upstream—instead.\nA commemorative mural of the subway, painted by local artists Peaceful Progress, can be found at the southern end of Pont Y Werin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Heysham hogback is an early medieval sculpted stone discovered around the beginning of the 19th century in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, Heysham, on the Lancashire coast, and now kept for protection inside the church.  It is one of seventeen known early medieval stones in Heysham.  It is a product of the 10th-century Norse culture of the British Isles of which the precise purpose is not certainly known, though it may be a grave-marker.  The carvings on the stone have been the subject of much dispute, different scholars interpreting them as showing a hunting scene, the patriarch Adam, the Norse hero Sigurd, the end of the world in Norse myth, or as being intended to blend both Christian and pagan themes.  It has been called \"perhaps the best example of its kind in the country\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Heysham hogback is, like other hogbacks, a grave-marker, monument or perhaps cenotaph, dating from the 10th century and probably from the period 920–950.  The man it commemorates is thought to have been a high-status individual connected with the Hiberno-Norse communities of Cumbria or Yorkshire, and its position on the coast suggests that he was a trader.\nThe first documentary record of the hogback is a mention in the 1811 edition of An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Town of Lancaster, published by Christopher Clark, of its discovery in St Peter's churchyard.  The 1807 edition of this work does not mention it, from which it has been argued that it must have been unearthed between those two years, but this inference has been disputed.  The same work claims that \"at the time of its discovery, there was found deposited under it, the remains of a human skeleton, and also, a piece of iron, which had apparently been the head of a spear\".  This, if true, would make it the only hogback found in association with human remains or grave goods.  A much later account in Edward L. Cutts's A Manual for the Study of the Sepulchral Slabs and Crosses of the Middle Ages (1849) surmises that it was found in the adjoining St Patrick's Chapel.\nIt was kept in the open air in St Peter's churchyard where it suffered erosion from the weather and from the many local children who, over the years, played at taking rides on it.  In 1961 it was taken into the church, where it remains.\n\n\n== Physical description ==\n\nThe hogback's length is 205.8 cm (81.0 in), its width varies between 17.8 cm (7.0 in) and 20.3 cm (8.0 in), and its height between 33.0 cm (13.0 in) and 39.4 cm (15.5 in).  It is made of Ward's Stone sandstone, a pale brown millstone grit of the Silsden Formation which could have originated anywhere on the Morecambe Bay coast between Heysham and Bolton-le-Sands.  It is in good condition except on the ridge, which shows signs of wear.\n\n\n== The carvings ==\nThe hogback is carved on all sides with figures.  At each of the two ends is a beast with a head disproportionately large for its body-size and, unusually, with four legs – on most hogbacks only two are shown.  Face A is topped by a row of tegulae, i.e. tile shapes, below which is a roof area featuring amid abstract decoration a recumbent human figure, curly-tailed animal and a twisting snake-like shape.  The lower \"wall\" section is framed by four human figures, two on each side, with hands raised in the orans position; between the two humans on the right is a beast, possibly a dog, in a vertical position.  In the middle of the \"wall\" area, between the two groups of human figures, are five beasts, three of which are at \"ground\" level; one of these is identifiable as a stag with antlers.  Above \"ground\" level are two more beasts, one, perhaps a dog, standing on the stag's back and the other in an inverted position above one of the \"ground\"-level beasts.  Face B has, above, two rows of tegulae.  Beneath them, reading from left to right, are two beasts, one above the other, two large birds, a tree (?) with horizontal branches, a third bird, a human figure in the orans position, and on the furthest right two more beasts.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\nThe very first published record of the Heysham hogback, in 1811, confessed that \"it is not so easy to discover the Artist's meaning in the figures represented thereon\".  This has not stopped scholars from forming theories, some of which were presented to the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society towards the end of the 19th century.  The archaeologist George Forrest Browne wrote in 1887 that the scenes depicted could scarcely be anything but an animal hunt, pictured for its own sake rather than as a religious allegory.  To this Thomas Lees objected that \"The persons are represented less as hunters than as themselves hunted by wild beasts.\"  His own view, given in 1891, was that the subject of the sculpture was the Death of Adam, a story found in certain Islamic legends and in Greek apocryphal Christian sources: the Apocalypse of Moses, the Gospel of Nicodemus, the Acts of Philip.  The same year, Henry Colley March criticised this interpretation, the story of Adam's death being in his view too little-known in the early Middle Ages and capable of explaining too few of the figures on the hogback.  He considered the scenes there a depiction of the story of Ragnarök, the end of the universe in Norse mythology, reinterpreted by a Christian artist to proclaim Christ the Conqueror and Christ the Redeemer.\nWriting in 1950, H. R. Ellis Davidson found the Adamic interpretation far-fetched, preferring March's Ragnarök interpretation of face A, though she was more sceptical of its relevance to face B since it fails to explain several of the beasts.  She concluded that March's theory explains the evidence more plausibly than any other.  More recently, support has been expressed both for the Ragnarök theory and by others for an interpretation of the carvings as a version of the Biblical story of Adam's naming of the animals, a theme also explored by medieval Irish sculptors.  Another new interpretation has emerged, supported by James Lang and Thor Ewing among others, which would see the carvings as being a portrayal of the legend of Sigurd and Regin, but proponents of this theory face the problem that several of the images normally found in British Sigurd sculptures are absent from the Heysham hogback.  Rosemary Cramp took a compromise position, proposing that face A had a Christian subject and face B a pagan one, though she acknowledged that \"it is equally possible that all of these strange motifs were capable of being interpreted in the light of both religions\".  Sue Margeson held an opinion similar to Browne's, seeing in the Heysham carvings no more than a simple hunting scene.\nAndrew White, the curator of Lancaster Museum, has warned that \"the only people who are certain about the subject of the Hogback are those who do not know anything about the genre\", and the archaeologist B. J. N. Edwards summed up the state of the scholarship thus: \"Despite a number of attempts to 'explain' the sculptures, none has yet been put forward which is really convincing, and it has to go down as a 'don't know'.\"\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDurham University (2020). \"Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture: Heysham 05, Lancashire\".

Early work on applying this representation to a network used a fixed depth of two and did not appear to be a promising alternative to perceptrons for image processing.\nMore recently, a deep learning algorithm was proposed for constructing these representations using Urysohn operators. In 2021, the representation was successfully applied to a deeper network. In 2022, ExSpliNet brought together the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation with B-splines and probabilistic trees to show good performance on the Iris flower, MNIST, and FMNIST datasets, and argued for the better interpretability of this representation compared to perceptrons.\nThe term \"Kolmogorov–Arnold Network\" was introduced by Liu et al. in 2024, which generalizes the networks to arbitrary width and depth, and demonstrated strong performance on a realistic class of multivariate functions although training is inefficient.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arnsberg Castle (German: Schloss Arnsberg) is a former palace in Arnsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. It is a located on a 256 m (840 ft) high hill.\nArnsberg castle was constructed as the seat of the counts of Werl-Arnsberg, probably around 1100. It served as residence of the counts of Arnsberg until 1368. With the transition of the county into the possession of the Electorate of Cologne, it became the centre of power of the Duchy of Westphalia. The electors resided, hunted and feasted there during their visits, the Landdrost had his seat there as governor, and partially the provincial assemblies also took place there.\nElector Salentin of Isenburg (1532–1610) had the castle redesigned in the renaissance style around 1575. Under Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (1621–1688), there was another renovation in 1654. A fundamental redesign in the baroque style took place from 1739 onwards under Elector Clemens August of Bavaria (1700–1761) with help of the architect Johann Conrad Schlaun (1695–1773), creating a cheerful palace and hunting lodge. Arnsberg castle was destroyed in 1762 during the Seven Years' War.\nToday, the complex is a castle ruin and can be freely visited.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe development and construction history of the complex can be traced more precisely through artistic representations, plans, and descriptions only since the 16th century. Only a larger-scale archaeological investigation could provide insights into earlier phases of construction. Excavations in 2023 revealed medieval wall structures, which may have belonged to an early ring wall.\n\n\n=== Medieval castle: the \"Grafenburg\" ===\n\nThe early history of the complex is largely obscure. Around 1060, count Bernhard II of Werl (1010–1070) built the so-called old castle, also known as \"Rüdenburg\", on a hill at the confluence of the Walpke and Ruhr rivers. Between 1070 and 1080, Konrad II (1040–1092) relocated the seat of the Counts of Werl to Arnsberg. Earlier, the construction of the \"Grafenburg\" (i.e., the location of the current castle ruins) on the hill opposite \"Rüdenburg\" was attributed to him, with the year of origin given as 1077. Today, the relocation of the Count's seat from Werl to Arnsberg is attributed to Count Friedrich the Belligerent (1075–1124) around 1100.\nIn 1102, a castle in the area of present-day Arnsberg was destroyed by Frederick I, Archbishop of Cologne (1075–1131), because count Friedrich had sided with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV (1050–1106) during the Investiture Controversy. According to Leidinger, this was the \"Rüdenburg\", not, as stated in older literature, the \"Grafenburg\".\nAnother destruction of the castle occurred in 1166 under the rule of count Heinrich I, whose brother's murder triggered a punitive campaign by Henry the Lion (1129/31-1195). A third destruction occurred in 1366 during a feud between count Gottfried IV of Arnsberg (1295–1371) and count Engelbert III of the Mark (1330–1391). In both cases, the castle was rebuilt.\nLittle is known about the appearance of the medieval castle. It is likely that even then, a main building with strong corner towers enclosed the castle area to the south. The first indications of a castle chapel date back to 1114. The castle was the nucleus of the town of Arnsberg, which emerged from a small settlement of vassals and craftsmen. The castle itself was the residential and administrative centre of the County of Arnsberg. In two documents from 1259 and 1270, an \"aurea caminata\" (a golden hall) is mentioned, indicating a partly representative furnishing. The construction of a three-aisled chapel and the layout of the main tower also hint at a magnificent complex.\n\n\n=== 16th century: Salentin of Isenburg and the creation of a renaissance castle ===\nAfter the sale of the County of Arnsberg to the Electorate of Cologne in 1368, as count Gottfried IV was childless and last of his line, the castle served as the residence of the Archbishops of Cologne when they visited the Duchy of Westphalia. During the Soest Feud (1444–1449), it served as the main base for the troops of Archbishop Dietrich II von Moers (1385–1463). During the following period, the castle was little used and fell into disrepair.\nInitially, there were no changes to the structural condition. This changed only when a redesign was carried out under Elector Salentin of Isenburg (1532–1610) in 1575. The defensive character, which was never completely lost in subsequent constructions, was preserved. The redesign focused on dismantling the roof and timberwork of the castle and reusing and integrating the walls for cost reasons. The plans for the renovation were provided by the architect Laurenz von Brachum. Probably, his son, who also appears in sources as Johannes von Arnsberg, was the actual builder. The architects of the Duke of Jülich and the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Hans Wezel, were also consulted for advice. The construction was not completed by the time of Salentin's abdication. Construction continued under his successors, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg (1547–1601), Ernest of Bavaria (1554–1612), and Ferdinand of Bavaria (1577–1650).\n\n\n=== 16th century: A description of how the castle looked like ===\n\nA map created around 1653 provides at least a basic representation of the medieval castle. Approaching from the town, a passage allowed access to the castle area. Further up the hill, there was a gatehouse located between outworks and battery fortifications. Passing by additional outworks, visitors entered a gate in the western tower and reached the courtyard of the castle complex. This courtyard was almost entirely surrounded by buildings except for an area in the east. In the west was the seat of the Landdrost, the representative of the sovereign in the Duchy of Westphalia. In the middle of the courtyard, measuring 130 m × 60 m (430 ft × 200 ft), was the castle chapel, connected to the Landdrost wing by a corridor. Directly connected to the chapel was the keep, also known as the White Tower, which towered over the entire complex. The tower and chapel were still surrounded by a wall, with an additional building of unknown purpose attached to it.\nIn the northern part were likely economic buildings, including the Gallows Gate, another small gate to the north. This area also included additional structures such as a brewhouse, a battery facing north, and the powder tower. In the east were likely stables with a carriage house, and further south, a slaughterhouse and well house. The well was constructed in 1576 during Salentin's time, reaching a depth of 43 meters into the rock of the Schlossberg.\nA short east wing adjoined the main building, situated between the aforementioned west and east towers, both four stories high. In front of the east tower was another fortification with another building, perhaps serving as a guardhouse. The main building underwent a significant architectural redesign, featuring a large hall (38 m × 19 m (125 ft × 62 ft)) on the first floor, unusually supported by iron at that time. The castle chapel, in particular, was splendidly furnished. A contemporary inventory by the Oberkellner Hermann Dücker listed forty-nine rooms in total, including a castle library and a chamber for Jesuits.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Maximilian Henry of Bavaria ===\n\nIn the following decades, not least the Thirty Years' War contributed to the deterioration of the complex, until under Elector Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (1621–1688) from 1654, first a restoration and later a redesign took place. Immediately after taking office, he ordered the responsible monasteries of Wedinghausen and Rumbeck to restore the dilapidated waterworks. It is not entirely clear when the waterworks were originally built. It is unlikely to date back to Salentin's time, as he had the well deepened.\nImprovements to the defensive structures began early on. The three artillery batteries in front of the east and west towers and to the north were expanded with partly underground outworks.\nThe actual renovation work was led by the Waldeck master builder Hans Deger. He submitted initial designs in early 1661. After modifications requested by the Elector, construction began with the west tower. This was followed by the central building. About a year later, the construction work was completed.\nThe two corner towers were expanded. In the western tower, the upper floors each had six rooms, including the Elector's main room. Instead of wooden flooring, this room featured a floor made of delicate ashlar stones. Windows and doors were also enlarged. Similarly, the other tower was redesigned. In the main building, four rooms were separated from the great hall, serving as antechambers, audience rooms, and dressing rooms. The floor was paved with stones. Above the hall, a gallery was built with eight habitable rooms, each with a fireplace and stove. Beneath the floor with the hall were five cross vaults housing the kitchen, dispensary, wine cellar, bakery, silver chamber, and similar spaces.\nThe external appearance of the Salentin building hardly changed. Particularly, the buildings north of the main building underwent little change. A distinction was now made between new and old buildings. In total, there were now 68 rooms. The Elector's quarters were particularly lavish, adorned with gilded leather tapestries and silk coverings. The audience room was furnished for the Elector's confidant Franz Egon von Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg (1626–1682). To pursue his alchemical interests, the Elector also had a laboratory and a pharmacy installed.\nEven after completion, there were ongoing problems. The first renovation works became necessary as early as 1670. Lightning struck the White Tower, dating back to the Middle Ages, three times between 1660 and 1683, causing significant damage. In 1685/86, the tower was renovated, and adjacent buildings in disrepair were demolished, leading to design proposals for the expanded castle square. The upper floor of the adjacent castle chapel proved irreparable. The resulting drawings show the only known floor plan of the tower and chapel. The chapel had a flattened apse and was supported by four pillars. Originally, the chapel had two floors. One chapel was intended for servants and the other for the castle lords. The upper floor was secularized in the 16th century.\n\n\n=== 18th century: Joseph Clemens of Bavaria ===\n\nIn the last years of Maximilian Heinrich's rule, further work was necessary to halt the decay of the castle. Similarly, under Joseph Clemens of Bavaria (1671–1723), the situation persisted. The White Tower continued to be a concern. In 1700, a tower of the main building was damaged by fire. Again, in 1711, a fire broke out in the castle. The curtain wall and various outbuildings proved increasingly dilapidated. After some emergency measures, a thorough examination of the building was conducted in 1717, involving the master builder Lambert Friedrich Corfey. This revealed massive damage. However, a comprehensive and costly renovation did not take place. The poor condition of the building was brought to attention by the Oberkellner of the Duchy of Westphalia, Bernhard Adolf von Dücker, in 1718. He pointed out that the winter weather had worsened the situation. Ceilings had collapsed due to rainwater leakage, and beams had rotted. He feared that the next provincial assembly could not be held in the castle. Around 1720, the Landdrost Ferdinand Caspar von Droste and the Oberkellner Bernd Adolf von Dücker made proposals, outlining the further development with the demolition of dilapidated buildings and the construction of a baroque three-wing complex. Another fire occurred in 1723, destroying the grand hall.\n\n\n=== 18th century: Clemens August of Bavaria: creation of a baroque residential palace and hunting lodge ===\n\nClemens August of Bavaria (1700–1761), the successor, found a building that resembled a ruin in parts. Consequently, Clemens August decided on a restoration, accompanied by significant redesign into a residential castle and hunting lodge. A considerable portion of the costs was borne by the Estates. Initial funds were allocated under Joseph Clemens. In 1723, another approval of 10,000 talers was granted solely for the castle construction.\nThis construction began around 1729/30 under the prominent baroque architect Johann Conrad Schlaun (1695–1773). The works were likely completed by 1743 with the consecration of the castle chapel. Most of the side and ancillary buildings were demolished, including the old chapel, the keep, and the Landdrost wing. This created a large area north of the main building, enclosed by a simple wall. Only in the northwest did some outbuildings remain.\nThe main building with the two corner towers likely remained largely intact. The main building was about 36.30 m (119.1 ft) wide and 21.5 m (71 ft) deep. The ground floor consisted of a barrel vault with a height of 5.50 m (18.0 ft), followed by an intermediate floor with a cross vault at the same height. The grand hall above was approximately 7.50 m (24.6 ft) high. With various intermediate ceilings, the height reached 20 m (66 ft) without the roof.\nThe 16 m × 16 m (52 ft × 52 ft) towers were crowned with semi-circular domes and a lantern, making the actual towers 27 m (89 ft) high. With the roof and lantern, they stood about 50 m (160 ft) tall. The towers were similar to the towers of Bensberg Castle near Cologne, and the Princely Abbey of Corvey.\nTwo side wings were added to the main building in the north direction. These were about 30 m (98 ft) long and 14 m (46 ft) wide, with three floors above a basement in the courtyard area. The castle chapel was located in the eastern wing. In total, the habitable area of the castle, excluding basement and attic, was 3,500 m2 (38,000 sq ft). Thus, a representative, symmetrical, three-winged Baroque palace complex was created. The entrance was from the courtyard side via a magnificent staircase. Design drawings by Schlaun have survived.\nThe centrepiece of the castle remained the grand hall with two large fireplaces. This hall provided ample space for a procession to listen to a sermon. Venetian tapestries adorned the walls, and six large paintings depicting hunting scenes and fourteen portrait paintings hung in the hall. These included portraits of the last five Cologne electors, members of the Wittelsbach family, and Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian (1282–1347). The hall was illuminated by eleven large chandeliers and twenty-four wall sconces. It contained twelve dining tables, a musicians' table, and sixty chairs. The billiard room included not only the billiard table but also several gaming tables. The Elector's bedroom had yellow silk damask wallpaper and a canopy bed made of similar fabric. There were tables with inlays, chests of drawers, a gaming table, and precious mirrors. Additionally, there was a writing cabinet and a bedroom. A painting of Charlemagne adorned the dining room. Other rooms included an audience room and a dressing room, where the Westphalian Estates Cup was kept. The chapel, housed in a side wing, had four benches, an altar with a Madonna, and additional religious images. Additionally, there were rooms in the side wings for the entourage, servants, various officials, as well as kitchen and utility rooms.\nDuring the Seven Years' War, the castle and the city were bombarded and set on fire and destroyed in April 1762 by Prussian and Hanoverian troops under the command of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick (1735–1806), to force a French garrison allied with Electoral Cologne, consisting of 200 men, to surrender. During the bombardment, 2,000 canon shots, 300 fireballs, and 1,200 canon balls were fired on the castle. What bombs and grenades left standing was rendered unusable by mines days later. It was strategic unimportant decision and led to a loss of cultural important residential castle and hunting lodge.\n\n\n==== Gallery: Designs by Johan Conrad Schlaun for Schloss Arnsberg (1730-1735) ====\nThe LWL Landesmuseum in Münster has a set of designs made by Johan Conrad Schlaun for Schloss Arnsberg.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Castle ruins ===\n\nThe castle complex itself has since become a ruin.\nAmong others, the Düsseldorf garden architect Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe transformed the Schlossberg area into a landscape park in the romantic style from 1818 to 1821. Somewhat later, some of the original gothic arches of the ruin were reconstructed.\nIn 1897, the city of Arnsberg acquired the castle ruins. The plans of the architect Engelbert Seibertz to build a Kaiser Wilhelm Tower with a restaurant and museum were thwarted by the outbreak of the First World War. Recently, there has been another comprehensive redesign of the area. The overgrown walls were cleared, a large-scale memorial for war victims was relocated to another location, and a circular path was created. In addition, below the ruin, a vineyard inspired by historical models was established.\nIt is said that the pastor and poet August Disselhoff (1829-1903) composed the song \"Nun ade, du mein lieb Heimatland\" (Now farewell, my beloved homeland) in the ruins of the Arnsberg Castle. For several years now, a ruins festival has been held regularly to ensure the preservation of the ruin and to enhance the attractiveness of the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther palaces, residences and hunting lodges of Clemens August of Bavaria;\n\nSchloss Ahaus\nAugustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl\nClemenswerth Palace\nElectoral Palace, Bonn\nSchloss Herzogsfreude\nSchloss Hirschberg near Arnsberg\nSchloss Liebenburg\nMergentheim Palace\nSchloss Neuhaus in Paderborn\nOsnabrück Palace\nPoppelsdorf Palace in Bonn\nSchloss Sassenberg\nVinea Domini in Bonn\nAmtshaus Wiedenbrück (also known as Burg Reckenberg)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nRosenkranz, Georg Joseph (1849). \"Belagerung und Zerstörung des Schlosses Arnsberg 1762\".

        "content": "The 2024 Rio Grande do Sul floods are severe floods caused by heavy rains and storms that have hit the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and the adjacent Uruguayan cities of Treinta y Tres, Paysandú, Cerro Largo, and Salto. From 29 April 2024 through to May 2024, it resulted in over 100 fatalities, widespread landslides, and a dam collapse. It is considered the country's worst flooding in over 80 years.\nThe floods marked the fourth such environmental disaster in Brazil in the same solar year, following similar calamities that killed 75 people in July, September, and November 2023.\n\n\n== Meteorological history ==\n\nAn atmospheric block, caused by a high-pressure system in Centro-Sul, prevented the displacement of typical meteorological systems (such as extratropical cyclones, cold fronts, and troughs) that cause precipitation. In the areas where the anticyclone was active, temperatures were 5 to 10 °C (9.0 to 18.0 °F) higher than the record values recorded by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), since areas of instability were confined to the state of Rio Grande do Sul. On 22 April, the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul issued a meteorological alert, later updated, warning of the risk of disruptions due to isolated storms and locally intense rains, which could cause flooding and power cuts. In the following days, the Civil Defense kept issuing alerts, along with forecasts for adverse weather conditions.\nHeavy rain and strong winds started hitting the northern part of the state on 28 April; by the following day, they had spread to almost the entire state. Storms occurring between 28 April and 1 May were caused by a cold front associated with a low-pressure area over the sea, while also being influenced by a moisture flow coming from the north of the country. According to an INMET report, rainfall reached over 150 millimetres (5.91 in) in some parts of Rio Grande do Sul in 24 hours on 30 April; they later reported that the average precipitation in the Porto Alegre area in the first twelve days of May could amount up to 333.1 millimetres (13.11 in), almost thrice the average monthly value recorded between 1991 and 2020 (113 millimetres (4.4 in)).\n\n\n=== Relationship with climate change ===\n\nIn 2015, the report \"Brazil 2040: scenarios and adaptation alternatives to climate change,\" commissioned in 2014 by Dilma Rousseff's administration and conducted by several research institutions in the country, already showed the trend of increased rainfall in the South of Brazil due to climate change. The report pointed to an increase of more than 15% in the level of rainfall in the southernmost region of the country. Other climatologists, such as Paulo Artaxo, a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Carlos Nobre, a researcher at the National Institute for Space Research, and Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, also correlated the frequent floods in the South of Brazil with the impacts of global warming in Brazil and the lack of public policies to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Victims ===\n\nAcross all regions of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, at least 144 people were killed, 806 others were injured, and 131 were left missing in the floods. At least 327,100 others were displaced from their homes, around 68,500 of whom are in shelters. AFP reported that two more people died in an explosion at a flooded gas station in Porto Alegre, where rescue crews were attempting to refuel their vehicles. The flooding was exacerbated by the partial collapse of the 14 de Julho hydroelectric dam located in the Das Antas River between the municipalities of Cotiporã and Bento Gonçalves, which left at least 30 people killed; four other dams across the state were also considered at risk of collapse. Another victim was reported in the nearby state of Santa Catarina, as one man died in the municipality of Ipira.\n\n\n=== Other impacts ===\n\nOver 500,000 people were left without power and clean water across Rio Grande do Sul, and flood damage occurred in 431 of the state's 497 municipalities, while many roads and bridges were destroyed and landslides occurred. Communication via internet and telephone services was also cut off by the floods in over 85 municipalities, with all of the three main providers (TIM, Vivo, and Claro) having their services affected and offering temporarily free Internet access via roaming to their clients.\nEntire cities in the Taquari River valley, such as Lajeado, Estrela, Muçum, Cruzeiro do Sul, and Arroio do Meio, were made temporarily inaccessible by the effects of the floods. The banks of the local river in Gravataí were also considered to be at the edge of collapsing, as four of the city's treatment plants had to be closed momentarily.\nIn Porto Alegre, the Guaíba Lake rose up to 5.31 m (17.4 ft), thus beating the previous record 4.76 m (15.6 ft) set during the 1941 floods, as most areas of the city were flooded, with more than 60 streets becoming completely inaccessible and more than 10 being partially blocked; rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles, boats, and jet skis in order to maneuver through flooded streets in search of stranded and missing people. Eldorado do Sul, a city in the Greater Porto Alegre region, was also hit by the flood, completely being engulfed by it. The mayor said that \"the city has been 100% destroyed by these floods.\" \nAcross almost all affected municipalities, classes were suspended, with 386 schools suffering damage and 52 being repurposed as shelters. According to governor Eduardo Leite, the reconstruction costs of affected cities could reach R$19 billion (US$3.7 billion). The flood displaced more than 700 people in Uruguay, and it shut down several rural schools.\nTen aircraft have been damaged, including PR-AJN Embraer EMB-505 Phenom 300, PR-DCL Beechcraft C90GTx King Air, PR-FHT Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100, PR-SCC Cessna T206H Stationair TC, PR-TTP Boeing 727-2M7(A)(F) Total Linhas Aéreas SA, PS-CNB Cessna 208B Grand Caravan EX Azul, PS-LCA Pilatus PC-24, Piper PA-46-500TP M500, PT-OSW BAe 125-800B, and the museum PP-ANU DC-3 Varig Exposition.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe floods were considered the worst to hit Brazil in over 80 years, and marked the fourth such environmental disaster in a solar year, as previous floods killed 75 people between July, September, and November 2023.\nClimatologist Francisco Eliseu Aquino told AFP that, while the region was already prone to extreme climate events caused by the collision of tropical and polar air masses, these events had \"intensified\" due to the effects of climate change, stating that the storms were the result of a \"disastrous cocktail\" of global warming and the El Niño climate phenomenon.\nAll the main transportation services in Porto Alegre, including the Salgado Filho International Airport, the Metro, and local bus services, suspended their activities for an undetermined period.\nOn 1 May, the Brazilian Football Confederation announced the postponement of all of the matches across the region throughout that week, including Série A, Copa do Brasil, Brasileirão Feminino, Série C, and Série D matches. Following an official request filed by regional-based clubs Internacional, Grêmio and Juventude, whose stadiums, Federação Gaúcha de Futebol, and training facilities were all temporarily unavailable due to the floods, the CBF postponed the games for a further twenty days on 7 May. When Internacional and Grêmio were competing in the Copa Sudamericana and the Copa Libertadores, respectively, both had two of their group-stage matches postponed by CONMEBOL at the time of the disaster.\n\n\n=== Reactions and humanitarian efforts ===\nIn the immediate aftermath of the floods, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, Eduardo Leite, said that the floods were an \"absolutely unprecedented emergency\", and \"the worst climate disaster\" the state had ever witnessed, even more so than the previous year's floods. On 1 May, the local government officially declared a 180-day long state of emergency. On 5 May, it was announced that the government had approved a R$117.7 million (US$21.8 million) worth package aimed to restore the state's infrastructures left damaged by the floods.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul on 2 May, holding a public speech in Santa Maria. The federal government sent aircraft, boats, and more than 600 soldiers to help clear roads, distribute food, water, and mattresses, and set up shelters, while local volunteers also helped with search efforts. More than 1,100 soldiers from the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, as well as more than 2,000 between BMRS officers and firefighters, were reportedly involved in rescue operations across the state. National Force and Civil Defense members were also sent by the state governments of Bahia, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo. The National Army also installed a 40-bed field hospital in the municipality of Lajeado.\nFlamengo, Palmeiras, São Paulo, and Atlético Mineiro all offered their stadiums and facilities to the affected football clubs; the latter team also made a R$100,000 (US$20,000) worth donation to the regional charity fund through their Instituto Galo foundation, and other Série A and Série B teams shared details about fundraising campaigns on social media, while the CBF donated R$1 million (US$200,000) to the victims and opened a parallel campaign. Starting from 6 May, the Civil Defense hosted a charity campaign for food donations in São José do Rio Preto.\n\nOn 5 May, after delivering the Angelus Address in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican City, Pope Francis expressed his solidarity to the victims of the floods; several other figures of the Brazilian Catholic Church commented on the disaster, including Archbishop of Porto Alegre and CNBB president, Jaime Spengler, as well as Archbishop of Santa Maria, Leomar Antônio Brustolin.\nOn 9 May, the Brazilian government, through the Minister of Finance, Fernando Haddad, announced R$51 billion (US$10 billion) in resources and benefits for the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The state-owned national bank Caixa Econômica Federal announced another R$66.8 billion (US$13.1 billion) in forms of financing and benefits.\n\n\n==== Mobilization of military resources ====\nOn 6 May, the Brazilian Navy announced the dispatch of the largest warship in South America, the helicopter carrier NAM Atlântico, which would depart Rio de Janeiro and head to the coast of Rio Grande do Sul. Atlântico was expected to carry 200 Marine Corps officers, 40 vehicles and eight between medium, and small vessels to help rescue stranded victims and transport supplies through flooded roads. \nThe Navy also mobilized the Oceanic Support Ship Mearim and the Oceanic Patrol Ship Amazonas, with the latter carrying three small vessels. The two ships sailed to Rio Grande do Sul on 7 May. The following day, the frigate Defensora was also dispatched in order to transport donations and supplies. As of 11 May, 12,000 Brazilian armed forces personnel are on the ground for the relief operations.\n\n\n==== Civil society ====\nSince the start of the heavy rains, civilian volunteers have mobilized to rescue marooned families and to assist families rescued in gyms, schools, and churches. They used all-terrain vehicles, trucks, boats, water motorcycles, and other transportation to rescue people and animals from flooded areas. Residents of less affected cities also organized themselves to support the search for and assistance to homeless families, as was the case with residents of the municipality of Portão, in Porto Alegre, who formed a network of around 100 volunteers to work in the neighboring cities of São Leopoldo, São Sebastião do Caí, and Montenegro. Some volunteers also started using their own homes as shelters for the people affected or as kitchens to produce meals. In some cases, volunteers used surfboards to search for and rescue the people who were affected. Volunteers also focused on rescuing and sheltering pets; in some warehouses, shelters were set up to receive dogs and cats. In Canoas, a makeshift center had already received 600 dogs as of 7 May 2024. Due to the insufficient number of fire departments, civil defense, and armed forces personnel in some areas of the state at the beginning of the relief operations, some people waited three days to be rescued. On 5 May 2024, the mayor of Canoas, Jairo Jorge, asked boat owners to help in the search voluntarily.\nAs a measure to speed up rescues, a group from Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis voluntarily and independently created an internet platform as a way of centralizing rescue efforts and also making it possible to make requests for help, with requests for help being transformed into geolocation points with routes to the location. As of 9 May 2024, it had already collaborated with more than 12,000 rescues. Other independent initiatives, such as Projeto Salva, support flood victims and animal rescues. Around 20 private helicopters have been used voluntarily to rescue people affected by the floods. On 10 May, private aircrafts departing from São Paulo were responsible for transporting 2.5 tons of donations.\n\n\n==== International aid for humanitarian assistance ====\nVenezuela, Uruguay, and Argentina offered humanitarian help to the Brazilian authorities.\nOn 3 May, the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Yván Gil, offered the Brazilian government support on behalf of the Venezuelan government and President Nicolás Maduro.\nOn 5 May, the government of Uruguay sent an Air Force (FAU) Delfin Bell 212 helicopter and its crew to Brazil and offered two drones and two rescue boats to assist in the rescues. A Lockheed Martin KC-130 plane from the FAU with equipment and humanitarian aid was also offered but was refused by Brazilian authorities due to a lack of proper aerodromes which were equally damaged by the floods.\nOn 6 May, the Argentine government, led by President Javier Milei, announced that they would send 20 Federal Police officers, divers from the Argentine Navy, as well as three helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane from the Argentine Air Force.\nOn 10 May, the White House National Security advisor, John Kirby, announced a donation of US$120,000 in resources and hygiene kits.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to 2024 Rio Grande do Sul floods at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Fleeced, or the Vultures of the Bush is a 1870 Australian play by Arch Murray, author of Forged.\nOne critic of a 1870 production at the Victoria Theatre, Sydney said \"It has merits, but they are of so questionable a character that doubtless Mr Murray would prefer to have them passed by, by the critic.\"\n\n\n== Vultures of the Wombat Ranges ==\nThe play was rewritten in 1878 as Vultures of the Wombat Ranges to take advantage of the Ned Kelly outbreak. Reviewing this production the Herald said it \"was produced to the apparent satisfaction of a very considerable audience, Of the drama itself very little can be said in commendation. In tone and in style it is also objectionable. The acting, however, was in every respect admirable.\" The Age said:\n\nAt the present juncture, when the horrible tragedy recently enacted at Mansfield is exercising the public mind, and when a spirit of sympathy for the murderous gang is evidently pervading a certain section of the community, the representation of any production likely to foster so highly undesirable a feeling cannot be too sternly reprobated. The impropriety of placing such a piece as Fleeced upon the stage of a respectable theatre must have occurred to the management, and it is a misfortune that they should have done.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Climate of fear is a literary work by Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist who is also the author of The Bacchae of Euripides (1969), Season of Anomy amongst other works. Through this non-fiction Soyinka addresses the way fear affects individuals in different ways, how fear is used in controlling people.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book centers on human's concept, view on fear with different stories which he uses to prove that fear has been around for a while. Years ago, people were afraid of various things like the atomic bomb. But in recent time, fears are now much more complicated, close to us through invisible, hidden powers called the \"quasi state\".\nSoyinka says this climate of fear didn't just start after September 11, 2001; it has been around for a while as the book traces it back to the year 1989 after an act of political sabotage hit a UTA passenger plane over the Republic of Niger which followed a widely publicized incident in Lockerbie, Scotland, shaped the outline of the current atmosphere of fear.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe book has a mix of stories about life and essays about politics, It was delivered during a lecture he gave at London's Royal Institution, Reith Lectures, in March 2004. At the start of the book, Soyinka talks on his past experiences, his fight with the Nigerian government during a war.\nAfter talking about his own experiences, Soyinka talks about big events in the world. He remembers how he felt that the world changed not only on September 11, 2001, but also in the year 1988 when a plane exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, and another exploded over Niger the next year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aleixo Piedade Fernandes (10 January 1910 – 30 August 1999), known professionally as Alex Mestri, was an Indian musician, composer, violinist, bandleader, and music director who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAleixo Piedade Fernandes was born on 10 January 1910, in Margão, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family. Fernandes was the son of day laborers Pedro Rosario and Joaquina Fernandes, who hailed from Navelim. He finished his initial undergraduate studies, referred to as \"Premeiro Grau\" in Portuguese. Additionally, he pursued English education up to the seventh grade at Union High School in Margão, now called Loyola High School. From an early age of 14, Fernandes exhibited an interest in music, dedicating himself to the study of musical composition, notation, and violin performance. His strong affinity for tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater, fueled his aspiration to compose music specifically for this genre. Encouraged by his father, Fernandes embarked on a musical journey that would shape his career.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPrior to his tenure as a composer for tiatrs, Fernandes initiated his musical journey by establishing a musical ensemble known as \"Alex and his Jolly Boys Orchestra\" in 1930, when he was merely 20 years old. The band flourished during its early days, gaining recognition for its performances at weddings, dances, and eventually becoming an integral part of the tiatr scene for two decades. Consisting of five musicians, including João Rodrigues on the trumpet, hailing from Quelossim, Bernard Fernandes on the saxophone and trumpet, hailing from Cortalim, Cheddo on drums, hailing from Maddel Grande in Margão, and Joaquim Silva on the banjo, who hailed from Borda, Goa, the musical group eventually dissolved, prompting Fernandes to gather a new set of members to form a fresh lineup. The subsequent iteration of the band saw the inclusion of Raia-based Gaspar, John Carvalho, Paixão hailing from Nuvem, Jack Minguel based in Fatorda and Piedade Santan from Colva. Fernandes, who had prior employment at a school in Nuvem and used to commute by bicycle, chose to resign from his teaching position to focus on his musical performances at weddings, dances, and tiatrs. The demand for his band was such that they were consistently booked well in advance throughout the year. In response to this high demand, Fernandes expanded the ensemble to comprise a total of twelve musicians. In cases of conflicting schedules, he would strategically divide the band into two groups, ensuring that one group of six members could entertain guests at one event while the other group of six members performed at a separate venue. Fernandes established himself as a popular musician, becoming sought after for his musical services during that period. Whether it was weddings, dances, or tiatrs, his musical abilities made him a sought-after figure. The Navhind Times lauded Fernandes as a musician, underscoring his popularity in the realms of weddings, dances, and tiatrs.\nFernandes demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for singing and acting, which was prominently displayed in his participation in local village tiatrs. He had the opportunity to showcase his musical talents through his involvement in theatrical performances that took place during festive occasions and important events, where he performed alongside local village boys. The Konkani actor and playwright, A. R. Souza Ferrão, played a pivotal role in guiding Fernandes into the realm of commercial tiatrs as a musician. Initially, Fernandes received a modest compensation of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹2,200 or US$28 in 2023) for his musical contributions, a sum that was later augmented to ₹25 (equivalent to ₹2,800 or US$35 in 2023). Over time, he became a sought-after composer, collaborating with directors of the era such as Saib Rocha, A. R. Souza Ferrão, and C. Alvares, among others. In 1958, Fernandes embarked on an African tour alongside his band and a tiatr troupe that included figures like Konkani comedian Jacinto Vaz, A. R. Souza Ferrão, Remmie Colaço, Anthony De Sa, Dioguinho D'Mello, Rico Rod, Aristides Dias, Lucian Dias, and Young Menezes. This journey encompassed 25 shows across diverse locations including Portuguese Angola, Dar es Salaam in the Tanganyika Territory, Kampala in the Protectorate of Uganda, Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru in Kenya Colony, and various others. Fernandes' musical contributions were not limited to his native Goa; he also lent his talents to tiatrs in Bombay, Poona, Karwar, Mangalore, and Belgaum, thereby expanding his artistic reach.\nFernandes was a popular figure within the realm of tiatr, a form of Goan musical theater. Among his band members was Francisco Antonio, also known as Frans Anton, who initiated his drumming career in tiatrs when he was merely 15 years old, performing alongside Fernandes and other band members. Fernandes significantly enriched the tiatr community by assuming the role of a music director for various productions spanning the decades of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. He gained acclaim within the tiatr community for his musical prowess, earning admiration from fellow artists. His compositions, known as kantaram (Konkani songs), played an indispensable role in tiatr performances, to the extent that staging a tiatr without Fernandes' music would be inconceivable. Before venturing into the tiatr industry, Fernandes showcased his musical talent as a choirmaster at the Nuvem church for close to ten years, highlighting his expertise in music. Furthermore, he offered his expertise in arranging music for the Trio Kings, a political trio comprising Joaquim-Jr. Rod-Anthony, showcasing his versatility in musical composition. Anthony, a former member of the trio Anthony-Nelson-Conception, was tasked with composing all the songs for the group.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes at the age of 34, married Felecidade Fernandes, a homemaker from Nuvem, Goa, on 21 January 1944. Their civil marriage registration was conducted in Margão, Goa. The couple had a total of five children: three sons named Agnelo (born 1947), Pio (born 1951), and Edviges (born 1944), as well as two daughters named Agnela (born 1946) and Maria (born 1949). Fernandes, originally from the Maddel Grande locality in Margão, worked as a music teacher in a school located in Nuvem. In a different anecdote, prior to embarking on his musical career, Fernandes held the position of choirmaster at the Nuvem church for a decade, as confirmed by Jose Alexandre Rodrigues, the member secretary of the Tiatr Academy of Goa. Fernandes frequently traveled to his place of work using a bicycle. Driven by his passion for music, he eventually decided to leave his teaching position to pursue a professional career as a musician, specializing in performing at weddings, dances, and tiatrs. \nOn 30 August 1999, Fernandes died at his residence at Madel, Margao, aged 89.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Qin Huasun (Chinese: 秦华孙; September 1935 - 3 February 2017) was a Chinese diplomat who served as the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations from 1995 to 2000 and Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1995.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in 1935 in the city of Gaoyou in Jiangsu, Qin graduated from China Foreign Affairs University in 1961 and in the same year, joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1961 to 1969, he served in the Information Department of the ministry, and from 1971 to 1980, he served as third secretary and then second secretary at the Embassy of China in Sierra Leone. After returning to China, Qin served as the director and later counsellor of the Information Department, from 1980 to 1984. In 1984, he was appointed as the deputy permanent representative and counselor of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Switzerland, and from 1987 to 1990, he served as the permanent representative, ambassador, and party secretary of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations Office at Vienna, Austria. From 1990 to 1993, he served as the Director General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences within the ministry and from 1993 to 1993, served as the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nIn July 1995, he was appointed as the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, succeeding Li Zhaoxing. During his tenure, in January 1997, China vetoed a UN Security Council resolution which would have sent United Nations peacekeeping forces to Guatemala to monitor a peace agreement which bought an end to the Guatemalan Civil War due to Guatemalan government inviting Taiwanese officials to the peace ceremony and Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Guatemala. In February 1999, China again used its veto to block sending United Nations peacekeeping forces to Macedonia after Macedonia established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. These two vetoes were the fourth and fifth vetoes used by the China in the Security Council. In March 1998, he was elected as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and became a member of the foreign affairs committee.\nOn 24 July 1998, when 11 countries which had diplomatic ties with Taiwan endorsed Taiwan's bid to the United Nations, Qin wrote a letter to then United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan where he criticized the countries for their \"brazen attempt\" to \"split a sovereign state.\" On 7 May 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was bombed by the United States, resulting in the deaths of three Chinese nationals, Qin termed the bombing \"barbarian\" and convened an emergency Security Council meeting in response to the bombing. His tenure also saw humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and East Timor. He stepped down as permanent representative in February 2000.\nQin retired in 2004. In 2010, he published his book Ambassador's Memoir: Representing China in the UN, which recounted his experiences as permanent representative. He died of illness at the age of 81, on 3 February 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nQin, Huasun (1996). \"The Importance of Observing UN Peacekeeping Norms\".

However, its first three representatives were appointed. The first Miss Grand Pará was held in November 2021 after the state franchise was granted to a local organizer led by Lucas Camisão. The contest, held on March 30 at the Tetaro Maria Sylvia Nunes in Belém, consisted of 14 finalists, of whom a 19-year-old Veterinary medicine student representing Ulianópolis, Yasmin Alcântara Resende, was elected the winner. Yasmin later participated in the national pageant held in Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná, and was placed among the top 11 finalists.\nDue to the change of national franchise holder in 2024, the state license for Miss Grand Pará 2024 was granted to another organizer led by Herculano Silva.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Pará's annual editions since 2023.\n\nNote\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of representatives of the state of Pará in the Miss Grand Brazil national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Brazil at Wikimedia Commons",

Collins Badewa of Style Rave describes the song as \"an infectious blend of energetic beats, vibrant melodies, and catchy hooks\". It is also said to combine \"threads of hiphop\" and \"afrobeats\" giving it \"an extra bounce\".Douglas Markowitz of GRAMMY Awards wrote that while the song pays homage to the Amapiano genre, it rearranges some elements such as the iconic log drum. Additionally, the lyrics are primarily in Yoruba language and pidgin and bits of English.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDennis Ade Peter of OkayAfrica wrote, All the bells and whistles of an Asake song are present, a maximalist canvas that includes warm piano keys, gorgeously droning violin, interpolated organ notes, log drums that mimic the staggering groove of Omele drums, and a bevy of stacked vocals in call-and-response mode. If anyone needs the clearest vision of what 'piano-inflected neo-Fuji' is, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better one than \"Amapiano\".The Africa Report listed Amapiano as one of the top music hits of 2023\n\n\n== References ==",

She has been a deputy in the Assembly of the Republic since February 2020 as a member of the Socialist Party (PS), representing the Coimbra constituency.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFerreira was born on 16 July 1969. She obtained a degree in law, a diploma in civil law, and post-graduate qualifications in social reintegration. From 1998 she worked as a lawyer in Figueira da Foz, a coastal municipality in the Coimbra District of Portugal.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nFerreira became a member of the PS in Figueira da Foz and in October 2022 became the leader of the party in the municipality. She has also been active in the Socialist Women group in the party. \nShe became a deputy in the National Assembly following the death of João Ataíde, who had also been president of the Figueira da Foz council until his death. In the 2022 national election, in which the PS won an overall majority, she was fourth on the list of the party's candidates and the PS won four of the available nine seats. In the March 2024 election, called after the resignation of prime minister António Costa following allegations of corruption against members of his government, she was again fourth on the list and was elected, although nationally the PS performed less well than in 2022. She became a member of the Energy and Environment Committee of the parliament.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ian Thomas (1942 – 16 February 2011), was a motorcycle speedway promoter and team manager, who managed the England national speedway team during 1980.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThomas was born in Ilkley, West Yorkshire and left school aged 15. After failing to become a professional speedway rider he took up various jobs before finding his way into the promotion of speedway.\nThomas and his business partner Jeff Brownhut founded Workington Comets after a successful application was made by for a licence to race at Derwent Park for the 1970 season. The move is credited in helping the Workington Town rugby league club avert financial troubles. The rugby pitch required moving 25 yards sideways to accommodate the speedway track.\nThomas started a company called Premier Sporting Promotions and in 1971 began to bring entertainment acts such as Ken Dodd to Derwent Park. In 1971, he also brought speedway back to Hull, when the Hull Vikings began to race at the Boulevard Stadium. It was at Hull that he formed a promoting partnership with Wally Mawdsley.\nIn 1974, Thomas bought the defunct Sunderland Gladiators licence and transferred it to re-form the Newcastle Diamonds, entering the team to race in the 1975 New National League season.\nThomas was named the manager of the England team in December 1979, to work alongside Eric Boocock, who was named coach and technical adviser. As England team manager he saw the international success, which included winning the 1980 Speedway World Team Cup and 1980 Speedway World Pairs Championship.\nHis career took a dive after he incurred financial losses of £40,000 with Newcastle during the 1984 season. He was forced to sell his house before launching a new promotion company. He returned to speedway organising ice speedway with co-promoter Graham Drury at Telford before working with Tony Mole in bringing back Workington Comets to race in the 1999 Premier League. Workington experienced a golden era, winning multiple trophies from 1999 to 2010.\nThomas died from cancer in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Morgan Aquino is an Australian soccer player who plays goalkeeper for Perth Glory in the A-League Women.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAquino started playing football alternating between goalkeeper and striker. She was scouted by then Western Australia state coach Elisa D'Ovideo, who selected her for the under-13 state team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nAquino started her professional career at her hometown club of Perth Glory, but did not make an appearance until January 2020, coming on as a half time substitute against Western Sydney Wanderers. She made three appearances before signing for Brisbane Roar for the 2020–21 season.\nAquino returned to Perth Glory the following season having made four appearances for the Roar, on a long-term deal. From then on, she started making more regular appearances for the club, sharing goalkeeping duties with her fellow goalkeepers Courtney Newbon and Sarah Langman.\nHaving established herself as Perth's first choice goalkeeper, Aquino went on to have a breakout season during the 2023–24 campaign. She played in every game and made a record 126 saves with a save percentage of 81.1%, which was the most of any goalkeeper in the league. Her efforts this season earned her a place in both the PFA and A-League Women's teams of the season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nAquino has been called up to the Junior and Young Matildas squads, and featured at the 2019 AFC U-19 Women's Championship.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n==== Perth Glory ====\nW-League Championship runner-up: 2018–19\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nPFA A-League Women's Team of the Season: 2023–24\nA-League Women's Goalkeeper of the Year: 2023–24\nPerth Glory A-League Women Members' Player of the Season: 2023–24\nPerth Glory A-League Women Players' Player of the Season: 2023–24\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In Greek mythology, Dercynus (Ancient Greek: Δέρκυνος) was a son of Poseidon and brother of Alebion (Ialebion). The two brothers engaged into battle with Heracles at Liguria of North-Western Italy. This version was mentioned in Aeschylus' play Promētheus Lyomenos, now lost. In some sources, Dercynus was named as Ligys and Bergion (Βεργίων) or Beergios.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nHaving obtained the Cattle of Geryon as his tenth labour, Heracles was passing through Liguria, on his way back to Mycenae from Iberia. Dercynus and Albion were supported by a numerous army. The battle that followed was fierce. Hercules and his army were in a difficult position so he prayed to his father Zeus for help. With the aegis of Zeus, Heracles won the battle and both brothers were killed. It was this kneeling position of Heracles when prayed to his father Zeus that gave the name Engonasin (\"Εγγόνασιν\", derived from \"εν γόνασιν\"), meaning \"on his knees\" or \"the Kneeler\" to Hercules' constellation. The story is also alluded to in Hyginus, Dionysius and Strabo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nApollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.

        "content": "The Sasanian - Kidarite Wars were a series of military confrontations between the Sassanid Empire and the Kidarites.\n\n\n== First Sassanid - Kidarite Conflict ==\nAround 350 C.E, the emperor of the Sassanids had to abandon his military expedition to the city of Nisibis because of the arrival of various central Asian nomadic tribes on their east and had struggles against them. During this period, the Xionite/Huna tribes who are likely to be the Kidarites, appeared as a threat to the Sassanids and even to the Guptas.\nAfter a long struggle, the Kidarites were forced to align with the Sassanids against the Romans.They agreed to enlist their light cavalry into the Persian army for accompanying Shapur II. The presence of the Kidarites in the Persian Campaign of the Western Caspian areas has been described by the Contemporary Eyewitness\nAmmianus Marcellinus.\nThe presence of Grumbates is also observed at the Siege of Amida in 359, in which Grumbates lost his son.\n\n\n== Second Sassanian - Kidarite Conflict ==\nThe alliance between the Sassanid Empire and the Kidarites strained and during the reign of Bahram IV  , the Sasanians suffered numerous deffeats against the Kidarites which allowed the Kidarites to settle in Bactria by replacing the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom. The Kidarite King Kidara proclaimed himself as the \"Kidara King of the Kushans\" on his coins as because the area was similar as of the western Kushans or Kushanshahr. According to Priscus , the Sasanians were forced to pay tributes to the Kidarites until the reign of Yazdgird II who had refrained from paying further tributes.\n\n\n== Third Sasanian - Kidarite Conflict ==\nAs Yazdgird II refused to pay tribute, this became a reason for the Kidarites to invade the Sasanian dominions and therefore during the reign of Peroz I the Kidarites invaded the Sassanian domains. Yazdgird II spent most of his life waging inconclusive military expeditions against the Kidarites but his last conflict on the seventeenth year of his reign, suffered fatality according to two Armenian historians and ended up as a tributary to the Kidarites.Peroz I lacked in manpower and hence asked the Byzantines for financial aid which was refused.Peroz I then sought peace and offered marriage his sister in marriage to the Kidarites but  instead sent a women of lower status, after a while when the Kidarites came to know about the fact, they in turn wanted to do the same to the Sassanids by asking for military experts in the hunnic army from Persia.\n\n\n== Fourth Sasanian - Kidarite Conflict ==\nAs soon as the 300 military experts arrived at the Kidarite court, they were either disfigured or killed and were sent back to Persia along with the information that the reason of the act was nothing except for the fake promise of Peroz I. During this period Peroz I allied himself with Mehama who was either a Alchon Hunnic ruler of eastern Bactria, together they put an end to the Kidarite power by 466  and the Sassanids took control of Bactria and Peroz I issued his coins at Balkh  which were based on the Kidarite coins.\nThe victory against the Kidarites were announced by the Sasanian embassy in Constantinople.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGupta - Kidarite Conflict\nKidarite Kingdom\nSasanian Empire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yuri Ivanovich Artamonov (Russian: Юрий Иванович Артамонов; born 1975), known as The Izhevsk Raskolnikov (Russian: Ижевский Раскольников), is a Russian serial killer and robber who murdered five people in the city of Izhevsk, Udmurtia from 1995 to 1997. Initially sentenced to death, his sentence was later commuted to 25 years imprisonment and he was released in 2017.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nYuri Ivanovich Artamonov was born in 1975 in the village of Kechevo, Udmurt ASSR, into a poor family with many children. He grew up without a father, and his was physically abused by his strict and cruel mother. During his school years, Artamonov had no interest in studying and constantly got mediocre grades, and after graduating from high school, he enrolled in a rural vocational school, where he studied to be a tractor driver.\nIn 1993, he was drafted to serve in the Russian Army and was stationed in the Far East. Upon his return, he moved in with his wife and parents in the Oktyabrsky district of Izhevsk, where the couple soon had a daughter. During this period, Artamonov began to experience financial difficulties and had trouble finding a job, which soon prompted him to turn towards crime. He soon bought a hatchet, work clothes and cotton gloves, as well as a revolver he got from the black market. He then stored all these items in a hiding place not far from his house.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nAs his modus operandi, Artamonov operated only during the winter, where he could wear his overalls and pretend to be a plumber who needed to \"check\" the heating systems of elderly people. At a convenient moment, he would strike the victim several times on the head with an axe and then take everything valuable from the dwelling. Artamonov would then give the stolen items and jewelry to his wife and mother-in-law, and spent the money on himself and his family. His main area of operation was in the neighborhoods of Mayskaya Street and 10 Years of October.\nHis first murder took place on October 25, 1995. Having read in a newspaper that Irina Mezhueva, a 36-year-old resident of the Ustinovsky district, wanted to buy a car, he called the phone number listed in the ad and learned her address. On the next day, disguised as a plumber, Artamonov went to her home and was invited inside. He asked Mezhueva to lock her Dobermann in a room, claiming that he was afraid of dogs, and then pretended to inspect the pipes and radiators for a while before asking her to pour him some water. When Mezhueva went to the kitchen, Artamonov followed her and struck her four times on the head with the axe's butt and blade, fracturing her skull and destroying her brain. After killing her, he stole 12 million rubles, a video recorder, five video tapes and gold earrings.\nInitially, Irina's husband Sergei was considered the prime suspect, after a neighbor's little girl said to police that she had heard a woman's screams shortly after he had returned home. While Sergei claimed that he was somewhere else at the crime, an inspection revealed that this was untrue. In addition, investigators checked the house of some of his close relatives, where they found an axe almost identical to the murder weapon. Finally, it was noted that the dog seemed to not be alerted by the criminal, who had evidently been willingly invited into the house. While Sergei's guilt seemed obvious at first glance, investigators noticed that there were too many inconsistencies and eventually released him after he was detained for five months.\nIn 1996, Artamonov committed two more murders and one attempted murder. On March 27, he killed a 68-year-old former English teacher, and on the next day, he unsuccessfully attempted to rob that same house. On October 4, he was caught stealing sheep in Malaya Purga, for which he was sentenced to 4 years probation. On February 7, 1997, Artamonov was met with fierce resistance during another attack, as a result of which he dropped his axe and hat at the crime scene, leaving traces of blood and his own hair.\nOn February 19, Artamonov killed a 72-year-old woman, and two days later, he killed his final victim, this being a 65-year-old pensioner who lived on a nearby street.\nThe so-called \"Plumber murders\" led to a public outcry and moral panic in the city, leading to people becoming increasingly vigilant and police officers detaining dozens of suspicious people after receiving calls from alarmed citizens. In the winter of 1997, the investigation released an identikit of the perpetrator, compiled from the testimony of surviving victims, which proved to be very similar to Artamonov.\n\n\n== Arrest, investigation and trial ==\nArtamonov was arrested at a marketplace on March 7, 1997, while attempting to sell a power planer he had stolen from one of the victims. He almost immediately confessed to all the crimes, and he was eventually charged with 21 crimes, including five murders, four attempted murders, a series of thefts and robberies. A forensic psychiatric examination found him to be sane, and he was allowed to stand trial.\nWhen the trial began, Artamonov insisted that her son be given the death sentence. In November 1997, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtia sentenced Artamonov to death, after which he filed an appeal. It eventually reached the desk of President Boris Yeltsin, who commuted the sentence to 25 years in a penal colony. Subsequently, it was further reduced to 22 years and 10 months imprisonment, which Artamonov served at a colony in Sarapul.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn November 24, 2017, Artamonov was paroled and returned to Izhevsk, where relatives said that he moved into an apartment on Pushkin Street. Per his parole conditions, he is obliged to report to the local parole authorities four times a month; is forbidden from attending mass events; to leave his residence from 10 PM to 6 AM, and to leave the city's premises without informing the necessary authorities. His parole conditions are set to last until 2025.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Russian serial killers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAndrey A.

        "revision_id": 1223515270,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Eva Luna is the debut studio album by British band Moonshake. It was released through Too Pure in October 1992.\nBlending elements of experimental rock, post-punk, dub, psychedelia, hip hop and noise rock (with an extensive use of sampling), Eva Luna is often identified as a key album of 1990s British post-rock and sampledelia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLed by former Wolfhound David Callahan and ex-Ultra Vivid Scene member Margaret Fiedler, Moonshake had first come to attention with the First EP, released on Creation Records in 1990, which had blended various experimental rock leanings with an interest in sampling technology, but which had been too much anchored to the indie rock/noise-rock tastes of the time, and which Callahan felt had also brought them an undeserved reputation as \"shoegazey bandwagon jumpers.\"  They'd followed up by signing to the Too Pure label and releasing the Secondhand Clothes and Beautiful Pigeon EPs, both which better incorporated their interest in the dub-bass-heavy post-punk sound of bands such as Public Image Limited and The Pop Group, and which also began gaining critical attention due to the band's unusual sample-driven and rhythmically propulsive sound drawing on breakbeats, electronica, psychedelia, art rock and Krautrock.\nMoonshake had also developed a method of alternating between the different song-stylings of Callahan and Fiedler – each of whom contributed, sang and dominated songs which were simultaneously fleshed out and expanded by the other in terms of extra instrumentation and production ideas. Building on what he'd already achieved with The Wolfhounds, Callahan favoured a direct post-punk/garage rock approach with strident \"bellow[ed] and sneer[ed]\" vocals and lyrics featuring social awareness, social commentary and angry satire. Fiedler, in contrast, whispered or murmured most of her vocals,  and created more impressionistic songs focussed on interior psychological landscapes and surreal takes on emotions, relationships and responses. This was later described by Louder Than War as making Moonshake, in effect, \"two different bands in a head-on crush-collision. Which to all intents and purposes it was.\"\nIn spite of their different methods, Callahan and Fiedler were at this stage very appreciative and supportive of each other's work, being quite prepared to alternate the front-person role both in terms of songwriting and singing. Callahan has reflected \"if you listen to the line-up with her and me, it's a schizophrenic band... It's got a dual personality. We did occasionally write songs together, but we were mostly flipsides to each other... But we'd also play with it more and have really noisy bits in her quiet songs and occasional really quiet bits in my noisy songs. The whole thing was meant to blend. There were definitely a lot of contradictions there, but that's interesting in a band, isn't it?\"\n\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nEva Luna was recorded over the summer and early autumn of 1992, at the now-defunct First Protocol Studios in Highbury, London (their sessions overlapping with some of the sessions for My Bloody Valentine's Loveless).\nDuring the recording of the Secondhand Clothes and Beautiful Pigeon EPs, Moonshake had persistently experimented with deconstructing and dismantling their songs in the studio. Regarding the former, Callahan remembers \"Margaret [spending] most of the session with headphones, on a sampler, just trying to match things to the music. She turned a song I wrote into something a bit more forward-looking... And then when we got to the studio, we took it apart more. It was all about deconstruction and putting it back together in different ways. And it worked really well.\"\nThis approach was carried over into, and further refined in, the Eva Luna sessions. Callahan credited much of this approach to the influence of Gang Starr and other hip hop acts, \"slowing things down, playing the stereo one a bit slower then the other one a bit faster, running things backwards, playing the samples like an instrument.... We really loved that. We thought, \"Well, we can do the same and perhaps we can write songs with this stuff.\"...\" He also mentions \"the way-out Stooges of Fun House, where they had Steve Mackay playing sax\" being an influence on the album.\nThe album's lyrical subject matter was often uncompromising, taking in at various times urban alienation, English insularity, prostitution and sex-murder, ecological issues and abortion. Louder Than War has commented \"[Callahan's songs] are all angry, vitriolic diatribes about human injustice and dysfunctional societal subjects set to keening, urgently propulsive arrangements, underpinned by those huge dub basslines, off-kilter hip hop drum patterns and topped with shards of acidic, coruscating post-punk guitars with all kinds of disorientating samples thrown into the mix: bhangra motifs, shrieking brass and saxophone interjections (although some of these are also played live), detuned keyboard effects, creaking doors, machinery, etc. [Fiedler]'s are more subtle and cryptically insidious : never has the art of whispered vocals carried with it such an air of true menace and unease. Whilst Fiedler's vocals may be low in the mix, the discordant maelstrom that whips around her, sometimes delivered through defiantly obtuse jazzy time signatures, creates an even greater sense of dislocation. The fact that many of her lyrics concern psychological dread, neurotic sexual obsessions or depravity, and suburban paranoia, merely accentuates this. Due to this dichotomy, the dynamic shifts on some of her compositions are, if anything, even more polarised and extreme than those of her writing partner, who favours a more direct and \"straight between the eyes\" approach.\"\nRegarding his own contributions, Callahan has commented \"I don't think it was didactic. It wasn't like lecturing people. I was trying to have fun and be creative with what was around me, and we weren't living in the best of situations, really. There was no money and places were kind of squalid. It's what you do to be in a band a lot of the time. But it was just reflecting... the city of London seemed to be decaying.\"\nCallahan recalls the band as having been \"well prepared\" for the Eva Luna recording sessions, following extensive rehearsing (with co-producer/engineer Guy Fixsen already involved for advice), but that they'd also embraced opportunities to improve the material further while in studio. \"One song in particular, \"Wanderlust\", was mostly Margaret's music but with my bassline and my singing over the top. We wanted that one more open ended so we could experiment with it in the studio. But for a lot of it, you'd play these songs live, take them in the studio, and realize some parts weren't working. You'd have to think on your feet... We would make sure that we got good live drum takes for a start. There would be some click tracks sometimes and there would be a bit of cut and pasting, but you really couldn't do a lot of that then... Dropping someone in to continue a take was about the best you could do at the time. So those are live drums, most of them. One or two are loops off a sampler, but we tried to confuse it so you wouldn't know which was live and which was a sample.\"\n\"Trying to get all those different noisy guitars to sound separate from each other, but somehow still the same, was a challenge. It was a lot of fun. I remember sending some demos to Terry Edwards — he played the horns on it — and he came in and I just said to him, \"Can you do some kind of free jazz on bits of it? And can you do an Ennio Morricone trumpet thing on the third verse?\" I just thought he'd do something kind of token, but he came and did these amazing horn parts, and it just really lifts the whole song... [It's] a noisy, Stooges-inspired song... but it just takes it so much further, almost into jazz. I'm just really happy with the way that came out. It was such fun to hear someone doing such good parts on your songs. I couldn't recommend it more, to farm it out to people like Terry.\"\nEva Luna ultimately satisfied both Fiedler and Callahan as a  record. Callahan: \"We knew we'd done something really good... We thought the Secondhand Clothes EP and [Eva Luna] had everything the band should be about on it. It had everything. We certainly thought we'd done something that was true to us that would either be ignored for being too out there or would make an impression. And, fortunately, it made an impression. We wanted it to be both weird and have songs. We wanted it to have an upside-down kind of layering. It needed to have big bass and drums, like some dub or funk records, but we also wanted to find ways to incorporate the samples in a way that didn't sound like they were sellotaped on, like so many other bands. We wanted it to be completely enmeshed in the songs and the music. And I think we succeeded with that.\"\n\n\n== Releases and reissue ==\n\n\n=== Original release ===\nEva Luna was released in the UK and France by Too Pure on 26 October 1992. An American release (featuring a reshuffled tracklisting and the addition of the songs from the Secondhand Clothes EP) followed on Atlantic Records/Matador Records in 1993. Cover art in both cases was by \"King of Fuck\", a.k.a. Mat Ducasse, a member of Skylab.\n\n\n=== 2020/2023 reissues ===\nAfter years of being out of print and unavailable for download, Eva Luna was reissued in download-only format by Too Pure (by that time, part of the Beggars Banquet group) in 2020.\nIn 2023, a full remastered version followed in both vinyl and download formats, via Beggars Arkive. Callahan and Fiedler contributed to the process of remastering and repackaging the record. The reissue featured the US track order with the addition of the Secondhand Clothes EP and the B-sides from the Beautiful Pigeon EP (\"Beeside\" and \"Home Survival Kit\"). It also included versions of four songs from Moonshake's BBC John Peel radio sessions. The Peel Session recordings were also released separately on vinyl as part of Beggars Arkive's 2024 BBC Radio Sessions project, as one of ten vinyl discs purchased and received via subscription.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n\n=== Contemporary reviews ===\nIn New Musical Express, John Mulvey enthused \"forget the claims of '70s revivalists — however attractive their music — to be the guardians of British music, Moonshake sound exactly how a band lost in London, 1992, and caught in the cultural crossfire should: vivid, intense, discomforting, fuelled by a sonic crush collision where truculent avant-rock is brilliantly mangled with hip hop, dub, free jazz, bhangra and a sense-scrambling barrage of samples. Hell, this is ambitious stuff… [This is] an exceptional record. Moonshake never cheapen their stories, never exploit their subjects, never preach or pass judgement… The result is an endlessly challenging, confrontational social document, no less. It demands your serious respect.\" The album was voted into the magazine's top 50 records of the year (at number 41), with the EP \"Secondhand Clothes\" being voted the 28th best single of the year.\nIn The Wire, Kevin Martin followed a similar train of thought to Mulvey, stating \"Moonshake are city dwellers enthralled and appalled by urban dog-eat-dog survivalism. On Eva Luna tales of love and loathing are set in a cosmopolitan dub zone, where disparate styles clash and the musical bulk is shadowed by relentless percussion and furtive sampled figures... Fiedler's torched singing sounds traumatised – as her sinister whispers outline internal persecutions in a Lewis Carroll world of beasts and birds. Callahan’s unforgiving raps initially overpowers with brute rhetoric... Moonshake are perfecting their own flow motion capable of matching Can... but where the flow of ‘70s German rock craved spiritual freedom and open spaces, Moonshake are moved by claustrophobia and enforced confinement. Their rhythmic mobility, shrouded by endless loops and discords, maps out an inner city neurosis which rivals PiL's \"Death Disco\" for Low End disturbance and Uneasy Listening.\"\nIn Melody Maker, Jim Irvin struck a more cautious note, commenting that \"Eva Luna is Moonshake's big book of wild stories... There's a sting in every tale, too – Moonshake are designed to unsettle – and a collection that proves they've quietly grown into tone of the most original groups we’ve got. But loveable?... There's a pervading sense of Inner City Dope Dole Hippy about them, something a bit grimy and squatty with an ugly underside... Such abrasiveness is in danger of making Moonshake that most hideous of things: worthy. Yuk. It threatens to turn their music into something you admire rather than love, but then I feel the same about Can, the Fall, Captain Beefheart, things which infuse the Moonshake sound [which] can be as wild and humid and all-consuming as a thunderstorm... They display a refreshing willingness to explore, an aural sense of adventure... It's deadly serious. Deadly full stop. Delightfully difficult listening.\"\nIn Allmusic, Steve Huey reflected that \"Eva Luna is bursting with ideas and tension; dissonant instrumental lines careen off of both samples and spacey dream pop textures, resting on a bed of hypnotic dub bass grooves and deliberate, deeply funky percussion... Callahan delivers his tales of despairing cynicism and rage over modern urban life with theatrical growls and nasal wails, while Fiedler's hushed murmurs and understated purr belie the aggression lurking under her songs' often nightmarish psycho-sexual dramas. Above all, Eva Luna's sound collages are dark and edgy, regardless of whether their overall tone is mellow or furious; the album's dense layers of sonic detail and the ebb and flow between Callahan and Fiedler's contrasting songwriting styles make it a richly inventive, endlessly fascinating listen...\"\n\n\n=== Retrospective reviews ===\nIn 1999, Eva Luna was voted 77th out of the top 100 LPs of the 1990s in Alternative Press. In 2005, the Italian magazine Blow Up included it in its list of \"600 Essential Albums\".\nPiero Scaruffi awarded Eva Luna a 7.5-out-of-10 rating on his website The History of Rock Music, hailing \"a singular (and brutal) synthesis of psychedelia, funk, rap, jazz... the instruments are played as if they were loops. The rhythms seem to evoke a continuous delirium.\" Unusually, although making the usual critical acknowledgements of Moonshake's Public Image Ltd. influence, he also inferred progressive and jazz rock forebears, suggesting that \"behind the curtain, you can also see the silhouettes of King Crimson, Soft Machine, Nucleus and Zappa\", and concluding that \"the album reveals an intellectual rock of the most arduous and reckless kind. The only flaw of Moonshake is the excess of talent. The group has created an atmospheric danceability that is the musical analogue of cinematic noir.\"\nIn a Trouser Press overview of Moonshake's work, Douglas Wolk described the music of Eva Luna as being \"always big, weird and unnerving\", singling out \"the whomping single \"Beautiful Pigeon\"\" and \"Callahan's best song, a cancerous dub-rock slither called \"City Poison\".\"\nA 2008 posting on the Young British Nationalist blog (covering \"Rock Music: The Definitive History\") mentioned Moonshake in connection with 1990s British post-rock. It described Eva Luna as having \"reduced the song format to a plasma of rhythmic and melodic fragments on [its] atmospheric experiments... A bold synthesis of psychedelia, trip-hop and jazz, [Moonshake's] sound basically upgraded Public Image Ltd.'s sound to the age of sampling.\"\nWriting eighteen years after the album's release, for a 2010 feature in Tiny Mix Tapes, Lavi Che stated that \"Moonshake should by all rights be legendary. However, they remain one of the most distressingly slept-on bands of the 1990s, dropping three albums and a handful of singles and EPs that earned deserved critical plaudits but — as often proves the case with bands that test and warp one’s conception of music — failed to find much of an audience, although they weren’t outright ignored... Moonshake's records have aged really well in the past 15-20 years. Most of their songs sound like they were committed to tape just yesterday… Eva Luna is a hard album to immerse yourself in, requiring multiple listens (as in the case of this reviewer) before it really clicks.\" Che named \"Seen and Not Heard\"  as the record's highlight, stating that \"in this reviewer’s subjective and inflated opinion (it) should have done for music in 1992 what \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" did for 1991.\"\nRetrospectively reviewing Eva Luna in 2013, Giana Avelli of Ondarock - while ultimately approving of the album - dismissed the idea of it being a post-rock record, instead locating it firmly as a reiteration of post-punk and suggesting that this also meant that it had aged better than contemporary 1990s records by post-rock artists such as Seefeel and Disco Inferno. Pointing to the relative brevity of the songs on Eva Luna as indicating their separation from post-rock, Avelli instead reinforced the album's connection to post-punk artists such as PiL, Gordon Gano, Rip Rig + Panic and The Pop Group, concluding that what Moonshake did was to \"take the groove (funk, dub, jazz)... burden it with an industrial aftertaste and project it into the '90s\",  reasoning \"although still far from the idea of post-rock as a new progressive rock, there was often a tendency to plot over the long term, creating a hypnotic sense and perception in the making, while here the songs are played in the short term.\" Pietre Miliari of Ondarock also added Eva Luna to the magazine's list of  \"Rock Milestones\".\nAs part of an in-depth examination of both band and record (in Louder than War in 2022), Martin Gray described the album as \"a complete anomaly among the sounds of 1992\", \"an album simply crammed with... highlights\", \"exhilarating sturm and drang\" and \"a formidable statement of intent\" (as well as in lyrical content, being \"disturbingly prescient today in the light of what we have just witnessed in the past couple of years post-pandemic and post-Brexit.\"). Praising the \"utterly spellbinding, dizzyingly genre-defying approach at articulating explicitly the sound of a city in the throes of urban psychosis and derangement\" and describing the first half of the album as \"a totally astonishing five-song salvo\", Gray's review took note of what he saw as the record's musical callbacks to Sun Ra, bhangra, free jazz and Raymond Scott cartoon scores; and he tagged original album opener \"Wanderlust\" in particular as \"a curiously bizarre hybrid of eastern exoticism, Afro rhythms and boho free jazz tempered by an insistent — almost swinging — percussive backbeat, embellished with the oddest samples you will hear: all detuned arpeggios, clangs and fluttering snatches of urban detritus. It really sounds like nothing else.\" Gray concluded that \"Eva Luna really is one hell of a ground-breaking record, and it stands resolutely alone among all of the albums released in 1992 as no other band has managed to create anything remotely similar before or since. It really is a unique album with few equals.\"\nEva Luna was voted the 23rd best post-rock LP in the Fact Mag 2016 poll feature of \"the 30 best post-rock albums of all time\" with John Twells suggesting \"while [they] pre-dated the “proper” post-rock scene by a couple of years, their experimentation undoubtedly informed what was just around the corner. Blending the misty haze of dream pop and shoegaze with ideas (including their band name) cribbed from Can and the krautrock scene, the band's approach was to throw everything into the mix and see what happened. This proved successful, and Eva Luna sounds prescient even now with its soupy fusion of flavours and techniques...They might not have shared the loudness or riffing of their later peers, but their experimentation captured the very essence of the genre.\"\nEva Luna was also voted the 33rd best post-rock album in the \"50 Best Post-Rock Albums\" poll feature in Treble Zine in 2024, with Jeff Terich commenting \"cock your head a little and view it at just the right angle, and Eva Luna just might scan as a pop record. Which it arguably is, as much as or perhaps even more so than any other record on this list, but Moonshake's debut album reaches that destination through curious means. Dubby basslines intersect with shoegaze guitars, early trip hop beat experiments, samples of obscure ’60s psych records, hypnotic loops and otherworldly psychedelia. It's less a grab bag of genre exercises than a curious fusion of seemingly all of them at once, floating through space-age bass noir in \"Bleach and Salt Water\", tumbling through uneasy psychedelic waters in \"Little Thing\" and finding hooks in unlikely places in \"City Poison\".\"\n\n\n=== Reissue reviews ===\nThe reissue of the album in 2023 provided the opportunity for further reviews and coverage, now with thirty years of further perspective. Awarding the record 9-out-of-10 in their in-house reviews pages, Norman Records referred to it as \"one of the most underrated debuts of the Nineties. A thrilling collision of sampledelia, shoegaze and post-punk - imagine if someone put early hip hop, My Bloody Valentine and PiL in a blender...\"\nReviewing the reissue for Brainwashed, Anthony D'Amico revealed \"listening to this expanded reissue now with considerably more adventurous ears, I still find this album oft-frustrating, but I am newly struck by how almost every song features at least one moment where Moonshake sounded like the best band on the goddamn planet... While the swirling chaos of the crescendo of \"Mugshot Heroine\" stands as an especially unhinged and wonderful moment, nearly every song contains at least one god-tier noise freakout or killer sample and every song features an absolutely stellar rhythm section (John Frenett and \"Mig\" Moreland) that can rival PiL or Can at their best (groove-wise, at least). Someone really needs to produce an instrumental dub companion from these masters with all the '90s alt rock elements stripped away, as it would be an absolute banger.\" D'Amico appreciated the inclusion of the two Fiedler-era Moonshake EPs, Secondhand Clothes and Beautiful Pigeon, judging them \"generally every bit as good as Eva Luna...The band's previously bootleg-only 1992 Peel Session is a bit of an inspired inclusion as well, as Callahan and Fiedler switch vocal duties for alternate versions of a few of their strongest songs... Moonshake at their best rivals the finest work of any of their more revered influences or contemporaries.\"\nIn another extensive essay (on Medium), Melissa Thyme Monroe drew attention to the band's use of noise rock (at a time when the genre was under-explored within British music as compared to the American scene), as well as commenting on their employment of psychedelic approaches and their connections with trip hop. Monroe also took note of the effects of the dual songwriter approach in terms of both art and politics. \"There’s an ebb and flow generated on the album that waves between the bombastic pain of city life and the insidiousness of empty houses. The original sequencing does this dynamic justice, juxtaposing these songs right next to each other. The lyricism from both songwriters contrast in a much similar way, with Fiedler diverting from her relatively conscious counterpart by creating whispery poetry around odd, uncomfortable imagery like pot-bellied she-wolves and animals eating other animals... While the archived history of the band didn't highlight much internal tumult, give or take the confused label fiascos plaguing them since birth, it was certainly unstable. This volatility lead to some of the best music in the '90s, however — certainly rhizomatic in their influences but clear in its modus operandi of transgressive sonic art through the distortion of convention. It also has the uneasy, almost unfinished discomfort that I feel is sorely missing from music these days: one that isn't afraid of being loud in the cityscape, that is dissatisfied and angry at the daily wrongs that hostile urban governments force upon you.\"\nA number of writers, including Monroe, have suggested that Eva Luna is not only the most significant Moonshake album but also the essential one, on which they perfected their art (with Monroe commenting \"Moonshake's debut album was like lightning in a bottle that escaped shortly after capture\").\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n(All details from Discogs.com)\n\n\n=== Original UK/France release ===\n\n\n=== US release ===\n\n\n=== 2023 deluxe vinyl edition ===\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from liner notes.\nMoonshake\n\nDavid Callahan – vocals, sampler, guitar, etc.\nMargaret Fiedler – vocals, sampler, guitar, synthesizer, cello, etc.\nJohn Frenett – bass guitar\nMig Moreland – drums, percussion\nAdditional musicians\n\nTerry Edwards – trumpet, saxophones\nYvonne Lacey – flute\nProduction\n\nGuy Fixsen – production, engineering\nMoonshake – production\nArtwork and design\n\nK.o.F.

Her story survives in scholia on Homer's epic poem the Odyssey.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nArethusa was a woman from the island of Ithaca; other than a son, no other family or lineage of hers is preserved. According to an anonymous scholiast on Homer, Arethusa had a son named Corax (meaning \"raven\") who was a hunter. One day while hunting a hare, Corax accidentally fell off a cliff and died. Out of grief for losing her son, the inconsolable Arethusa transformed into a fountain bearing her name on the spot Corax died, while the rock there took the name of the dead son thereafter.\nIn the Odyssey, after returning home following a long ten-year long journey, the disguised king Odysseus finds his slave Eumaeus tending the swine which graze next to the rock of Corax and the fountain of Arethusa.\nArethusa was a common name for springs in antiquity; today a spring with the same name in Pera Pigadi in Ithaca can been potentially identified with the mythological one, but much of this is speculative.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHyria\nPirene\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDindorf, Wilhelm, ed.

        "content": "Sex еt perestroika a 1990 French film with elements of eroticism, which through the eyes of French filmmakers shows the life of Soviet people and their attitude towards sexuality. \n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film contains many reportage scenes that reflect such characteristic features of life in Moscow during the era of perestroika, such as rallies in support of Yeltsin, huge queues at the first McDonald's, rock concerts, informal youth groups, black marketeers, etc.\nIn April 1990, a French film crew came to Moscow looking for an actress to shoot an erotic film. Directors Francis and Boris conduct auditions and screen tests for young VGIK actresses: each girl is asked whether she has watched erotic films, whether she is ready to star in such a film, she is also asked to undress and walk across the stage. Boris is dissatisfied with the hotel, conditions and potential actresses, believing that so far he cannot find suitable candidates.\nMeanwhile, one of the Russian assistant directors introduces Boris to Alena, who knows French well and works in a modeling agency. With her help, Boris finds new candidates for filming.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nFrançois Juffat as Boris, French director\nFrancis Leroi as Francis, French director\nAlyona Masurenkova as Alyona\nEvgeniya Kryukova as Zhenya\nNatalya Shchukina as Natalie\nEkaterina Inovenkova as bride\nSergey Bezdushny as Sergey\nOlga Koposova as girl in a taxi\nViktor Tsoi as cameo\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nAccording to film expert Sergey Kudryavtsev, Leroy and Juffa initially filmed the seventh part of the erotic series “Emmanuelle” in Moscow. Having looked at the material, they, however, “rejected this film with naked Soviet girls   but nevertheless, with Gallic wit, they got out of a sticky situation by releasing a caustic documentary film “Sex and Perestroika” about morals in the USSR, using episodes from the failed “Emmanuelle 7”. In his rating, Kudryavtsev rated this film 3.5 points out of 10.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSex еt perestroika at IMDb",

        "content": "Glastonbury Cemetery is a cemetery in Glastonbury, Somerset, England. It was established in 1854–55 and is maintained by Glastonbury Town Council.\nThe cemetery lodge and its two mortuary chapels became Grade II listed buildings in 1977.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of cemetery ===\n\nGlastonbury Cemetery was established at a time when the burial space in the churchyards of St John's and St Benedict's were reaching full capacity. Furthermore, new burial space was considered essential for the town as the population, including in the surrounding villages, was expected in increase in the future. A vestry meeting in October 1853 resolved to establish a cemetery and saw the formation of the Glastonbury Burial Board. A number of sites were considered by the Board, including the fields to the north of St John's, Fisher's Hill, Wearyall Hill and Edmund Hill.\nEdmund Hill, which was the Burial Board's favoured site, was subsequently chosen at a vestry meeting on 3 August 1854, although there was some regret that a suitable site closer to the town could not have been found. The same meeting saw the estimated costs for purchasing the land, constructing the cemetery, its chapels and lodge, passed. The site was then inspected and formally approved by the government during the following month. The plans for the cemetery's lodge, entrance gateway and two mortuary chapels (one for the Church of England and one for nonconformists) were drawn up by the architect Charles Edmund Giles of Taunton.\nConstruction of the cemetery commenced in late 1854 and was completed in 1855. On 5 October 1854, tenders were sought by the Burial Board for the \"erection of two chapels and an entrance gateway in the new burial ground\". The Board then invited tenders for \"road-making, draining and other works\" on 16 November 1854, followed by the \"erection of a lodge and gateway\" on 18 January 1855.\n\nThe first burial took place at the cemetery on 2 April 1855. The Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Auckland, consecrated the Church of England section of the cemetery on 8 August 1856.\n\n\n=== Extensions ===\nBy the end of the 19th century, the consecrated section of the cemetery was virtually full and new burials had to be made \"in odd corners, and in parts of the footpath\". It was reported in March 1900 that there were 26 consecrated spaces and 203 unconsecrated spaces remaining. A vestry meeting held in September 1899 decided to proceed with plans to enlarge the cemetery by purchasing approximately three acres of adjoining land on the north side. The purchase of the land cost £500 and a further £450 was spent on fencing, planting and laying out the ground.\nThe work was carried out in 1901–02, after the Burial Board invited tenders for \"draining, path-making, and other works\" on 23 October 1901. The Church of England section of the extension was consecrated on 9 May 1902. The Assistant Bishop of Bath and Wells, Bishop Stirling, performed the consecration on behalf of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. George Kennion, who was unable to attend due to illness.\nThe cemetery received another extension in 1999, when the Glastonbury and Sharpham Burial Joint Committee acquired additional land above the existing site from Mendip District Council. The extension provided the cemetery with further plot space for an additional 50 years, and has included a section used for green burials since 2005, the Edmund Hill Green Burial Site.\n\n\n== Mortuary chapels ==\n\nThe cemetery's two mortuary chapels fell into disuse in the mid-20th century and were under threat of demolition in February 1977, when Glastonbury Town Council voted to demolish rather than repair them. By this time, the Church of England chapel saw infrequent use only and the nonconformist chapel was used as a store. The estimated repair costs were deemed prohibitive and it was feared the buildings would become a \"danger to the public\".\nIn March 1977, following pressure from Glastonbury's mayor and councillor Hugh Barker and the Council for the Protection of Rural England, Mendip District Council placed a preservation order on them, thereby halting demolition for six months while an application was made for their potential designation as listed buildings. Both of the chapels, along with the cemetery lodge, became Grade II listed buildings on 2 August 1977.\nDespite the new protective status, Glastonbury and Sharpham Burial Joint Committee sought listed building consent from the District Council and a faculty from the Diocese of Bath and Wells for the demolition of both chapels. The plans were met with both local opposition and from organisations such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Ancient Monuments Society and the Victorian Society. The District Council rejected the plans in September 1977, concluding it would \"remove important visual elements from the cemetery to the serious detriment of its social, artistic and architectural character and interest of its landscape\". In February 1986, the District Council once again refused an application to demolish them.\nBetween November 1990 and January 1992, repairs to the Church of England chapel were carried out by builder Rowley Bisgrove of Baltonsborough at a cost of £21,500. In February 1993, Glastonbury Town Council expressed their desire to demolish the nonconformist chapel, which was now in a \"dangerous state\", but the Burial Joint Committee's application for this was refused by the District Council in June 1993. Repair work was then authorised in September 1993, after the committee received a £10,000 grant from the District Council and a loan of £28,000 from the Town Council. The £41,000 project was carried out in 1994.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nDion Fortune, British occultist, ceremonial magician, novelist and author, 1946\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlastonbury Cemetery at Find a Grave",

He thus held one of the most important military positions in the east of the empire. Whether Felicianus was the first bearer of this title, as recorded by John Malalas, is, however, controversial.\nEmperor Constantine I, under whom he served, appointed him as consul for 337 AD. He held the office together with Fabius Titianus. However, Constantine died on 22 May of the consular year. The name of Felicianus was removed from certain inscriptions, giving rise to the theory that he was subjected to damnatio memoriae. Nothing more is heard of him after the purge of the Constantinian dynasty following the death of Constantine the Great.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carlos Rivera Rivera (born 1955 or 1956) is a Spanish independent politician who has been mayor of Torremocha de Jarama in the Community of Madrid since the first democratic elections in 1979.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRivera studied for seven years in a seminary and said in 2021 that he would consider priesthood when he leaves politics. He was 23 when he was first elected mayor, having been prompted to run by negative local events such as the closing of his town's only school in 1974.\nDuring Rivera's mandate, his town grew from 140 inhabitants to over 1,000. He set up a public-run retirement home and a co-operative for the elderly. The town also accommodated a children's home that had been rejected by other municipalities, as well as public housing to prevent the emigration of young people.\nRivera is not paid for his role as mayor, instead working as a civil servant and as a secretary in four nearby town councils. While the law calls for council sessions to be held at least every three months, he holds them monthly, so that any councillor unable to attend once does not have to wait half a year. Rivera has faced some local criticism for his long administration, being called a Cacique, a Spanish term for a political boss; he responded by saying \"every four years the Cacique goes to the polls. And the residents, who are very smart, keep voting for the same Cacique\".\nIn 2013, Rivera was acquitted in a legal battle of over a decade, centring around the paving of livestock roads. Prosecutors had demanded a four-year prison sentence, disqualification from public office and €100,000 compensation. The court found that Rivera allowed the works as they had been approved by the Community of Madrid.\nRivera was one of 31 mayors to retain their post for the first 40 years of democracy in local elections in Spain. He and another mayor in the Community of Madrid, Luis Partida of Villanueva de la Cañada, retained an absolute majority in that time.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its conservation status is Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe first specimens where collected on Tlapacoyo.\nPeperomia tlapacoyoensis has long oval leaves with petioled tips that are acuminate; the base is rounded, opaque, leathery above and sparsely beneath; the central nerves protrude thickly beneath; there are two very fine nerves on either side that send loose spikes above the base; the petiole is hairy. The terminal leaves are somewhat larger than the leaves, and the petioles are equal to the peduncles, which are sporadically hairy. Orbicular bracts sub-sessile at the centre. At the centre of the stigmatic centrum, at the tip of the scutellum sursun pointed amata, a cylindrical pale berry openedly appeared.\nSimple ceraceous stem with simple hairs that are 0.005 thick and very densely hairy. Limb length: 0.065; width: 0.035. Petiole length: 0.015 in. Berry length is 0.003 in.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nIt was described in 1872 by Casimir de Candolle in Linnaea: Ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, from specimens collected by Frederik Liebmann in 1841. It gets its name from Tlapacoyo.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIt is endemic to Vera Cruz. It grows on epiphyte environment and is a herb.

        "content": "Shin Megami Tensei J, also released as Shin Megami Tensei EZ, was a role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus. It is part of the Megami Tensei series, and was released for Japanese feature phones starting on April 1, 2002, through a monthly subscription.\nPlayers would explore three dungeons in 3D, where they could fight demons, aided by a demon guardian summoned into their character's body, and search for treasure; there also existed a multiplayer mode, where players across Japan could battle each other one-on-one. The game was well received for the replay value of the randomly generated dungeons and for the amount of player options.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nShin Megami Tensei J was a 3D dungeon-crawling role-playing video game, which consisted of two types of segments that players could alternate between: in the preparation segments, players could learn new magic and skills, and buy and sell items and equipment. In the exploration segments, they could navigate three dungeons in first person in the demon world, whose randomly generated layouts would shift each time they were entered: the World of Gluttony, the World of Envy, and the World of Sloth.\nPlayers would search the dungeons for treasure chests containing items and equipment, with the goal of reaching the lowest floor and capturing each area; as they moved across tiles, a map would gradually automatically fill out to show the layout of the areas they had visited. Throughout the dungeons, they would encounter recovery springs where they could restore their health. Players could also re-enter already completed dungeons to replay them as they wish. While exploring, players would encounter enemy demons, which they fought in a turn-based battle system.\nPlayers could summon guardian demons into their character's body to help them in battle: they accessed one when first starting the game, after having chosen of the three alignments law, neutral, or chaos. New and stronger guardian demons could be summoned through the use of guardian cards found in the dungeons; the guardian demons could also be improved through battling, which would earn them experience points and raise their level.\nIn addition to the single-player dungeon exploration, players could have one-on-one guardian demon battles with others across Japan in the multiplayer battle arena mode, and compete to be the best in the country.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nShin Megami Tensei J was developed and published by Atlus, and was released for Japanese feature phones starting on April 1, 2002, as part of the launch of their platform Atlus Web-J on J-Phone's service J-Sky Java, where it was available as a monthly subscription; users could also access Megami Tensei wallpapers and music through the platform. This version of the game was split across two applications: the \"basics app\" for the preparation segments, and the \"demon world app\" for the dungeon crawling, requiring the user to exit one application and launch the other to switch between the two parts of the game.\nThe game was updated to add the multiplayer battle arena mode on July 19, 2002, and on July 22, 2004, it was also released through their Atlus Web-EZ platform on KDDI's EZweb service, under the title Shin Megami Tensei EZ. At launch, this version was only compatible with Toshiba's A1304T/TII phones, with support for further models added later. In August 2004, support was added for Java ME phones, in addition to the initial BREW release.\nNLab called Shin Megami Tensei J a \"must-play\" game for series fans, and Dengeki Online and Comptiq described it as a \"full-fledged\" Shin Megami Tensei game and a proper role-playing game; Game Watch thought it captured one of the big appeals of the Shin Megami Tensei series through the large amount of demons appearing in the game. NLab liked the randomly generated dungeons, saying that it keeps the game feeling fresh, and appreciated the amount of options available to players, enabling different play styles. They also liked the smoothly scrolling graphics, making the dungeon exploration comfortable. Sina liked the combat system for being easy to operate.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website for the Atlus Web-J version at the Wayback Machine (archived 2002-08-03) (in Japanese)\nOfficial website for the Atlus Web-EZ version at the Wayback Machine (archived 2004-10-11) (in Japanese)",

The draft was moved by the creator to the main NS without approval, and then I moved it back to the draft NS. —Saqib (talk I contribs) 14:40, 8 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nThe 1986 Miran Shah incident refers to an accidental intrusion of Pakistani territory by the 38th Commando Brigade of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Second Battle of Zhawar. The strike force, constituting 120 personnel and six helicopters, accidentally landed near Miran Shah, Pakistan instead of Zhawar due to poor visibility in the darkness of night. This force was surrounded and taken prisoner, with only 24 escapees.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Second Battle of Zhawar was a significant engagement that took place during the Soviet-Afghan War. It pitted Afghan Army units, supported by the Soviet Union, against mujahideen faction led by Jalaluddin Haqqani. The objective of the battle was to destroy the mujahideen's logistical base located in Zhawar, just three kilometers from the Durand Line.\nThe initial offensive, known as the First Battle of Zhawar, and was launched in September 1985. DRA divisions, with air support from the Soviet Union, initiated the attack while major mujahideen commanders were absent, including Haqqani who was on pilgrimage to Mecca. The DRA forces advanced from Khost and successfully captured the village of Bori, northeast of Zhawar. However, they encountered fierce resistance and were forced to retreat.\nThe main attack began on September 4 and initially achieved success, with the capture of the village of Lezhi and the killing of a mujahideen commander. However, the offensive was halted at the heavily fortified Manay Kandow pass, where the mujahideen put up a strong defense.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nOn 2 April 1986, the DRA launched artillery strikes and aerial bombardment on Zhawar cave network. Then six Mi-8 carrying 120 troops of the 38th Commando Brigade took off from Khost airfield, with the aim of landing at the designated point near Zhawar. The commandos successfully landed facing no resistance, but the ground assault had to encounter fierce resistance from Mujahideen forces present at the Dawri Gar mountain. The ground offensive was forced to stop as they were encountering heavy losses. \nThe command post for the operation was shifted from Khost to Tani and contacted the aerial assault group. The commander of the assault group reported that they could see the battle taking place far away from their location. It was now 3  in the morning. The Afghan government artillery fired an flare on the Dawri Gar \nmountain. The command station asked the assault group commander that \"Do you see the round?\" and they replied that the location was about 15 kilometers from their location.> The Afghan government artillery again fired another flare five kilometers south. Again the commander was asked that whether he could see the flare. He replied that it was about ten kilometers from their location. Command post informed the assault group that they had crossed the border and  landed five kilometers inside Pakistan near Miran Shah. Soon the strike group began withdrawal preparations.\n\n\n== Mujahideen and Pakistani response ==\nFollowing the air assault, the Soviet Air Forces bombed Mujahideen positions. The Mujahideen then attacked the landing zones of 38th Commando, overrunning four of them and capturing 530 commandos. A single group of Afghan commandos managed to hold out against the mujahideen for three days before being finally overrun. All six Mi-8 helicopters and all 120 commandos were captured. Pakistani officers were additionally sent to Zhawar and attempted to take down Afghan and Soviet aircraft with English blowpipes to no avail, as one Pakistani officer and his NCO were injured as a result of the aerial bombardment. Jalaluddin Haqqani tried and executed Colonel Qalandar Shah alongside 78 other officers who were forced to “confess their crimes” from different operations and then executed. However, regular soldiers were given amnesty as they were conscripts and were ordered to complete two years of labour if they wanted to be fully amnestied. After sustaining heavy casualties, the commando brigades were converted into battalions.\n\n\n== Aircraft shootdown ==\nTo bomb Mujahideen bases, the Soviet planes began flying over Pakistani airspace.  In response, the Pakistani Army sent a small number of soldiers with blowpipe missiles to shoot down any enemy aircraft flying overhead. They fired a total of 14 surface-to-air missiles on Soviet aircraft. Moreover, Soviet air strikes on Pakistani forces wounded two Pakistani soldiers.\n\n\n== References ==",

This feature of a play... contributes to specially commend it, at it would be altogether too tragic to pursue the string of so many melodramatic incidents without frequent intervals of mirth and ridiculous situations.\"\nA reviewer in the Advertiser said the author borrowed from the stage adaptation of Robbery Under Arms claiming he took two Irish and an Aboriginal character from the latter.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\"Act 1: To the Bush.

        "content": "Waitara Road railway station is a rural railway station on the modern day Waitara Branch railway serving the small locality of Brixton in New Zealand's Taranaki district. It previously served the Waitara Taranaki Co-operative Dairy Company and plant nurseries Duncan and Davies Ltd.\nIt is now the main working base for the Waitara Railway Preservation Society who run heritage services on the line.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original railway station was opened in around 1883, 8 years after the opening of the New Plymouth - Waitara railway. The station was located at the crossing of Waitara Road and was opened primarily to serve the Waitara Road Dairy Factory, the first such factory in the district. \nThe station first appeared in timetables in 1882 as a flag station or stopping place for trains but it wasn't until 1883 that plans for a 12 wagon loop were submitted. In both 1893 and 1894, urgent requests were received for the provision of a shelter shed. But it would be November 1896 when estimates for a passenger platform and shelter shed were received, and September 1897 when the passenger platform and shelter were finally opened. \nBy the turn of the century, that station was described as having an accommodation shelter shed & passenger platform (southern side), a loading bank for goods and a 16-wagon loop for delivering goods. Issues remained for customers dropping off or picking up their deliveries, caused by a small loading bank and an open drain close by making cart parking tight, and also that sacks of grain, potatoes and other heavy goods were often dumped at the station building or platform on the opposite side of the track from the cart access, meaning customers had to try and back their cart over the railway line to collect their goods. This wasn't rectified until 1926 when the coal shed from Turakina was relocated as a goods shed at Waitara Road (with the addition of a verandah) - work wish was costed at approximately £102.\n\n\n== Decline and closure ==\nIn the post-war years, much of the general traffic at Waitara Road station as motor vehicles became more affordable. The first to go was passenger services, which were replaced with Road Services buses. Next to go was the goods shed, which was removed in late 1957. \nWhile general traffic was falling, industrial traffic continued to keep the station running. Increasing traffic from the dairy factory (a result of the factory becoming Clifton Co-Operative Dairy Company and taking over several smaller companies in the area) led to new loading warehouses being built on the former goods yard in the 1960s and a progressive expansion in the factory size. \nAlso in the late 1970s, a new siding was laid to serve the plant nursery Duncan & Davies, which had relocated directly south of the station & shipped plants both nationally and internationally.\nBy the 1980s traffic began to drop. The dairy factory (which in 1980 became the Brixton complex for Moa-Nui Co-operative Dairies) closed in the early 1990s after over a century and Duncan & Davies stopped sending by rail, before going out of business completely. \n\nThe station remained technically open until 2 February 1999 when Tranz Rail closed the entire line.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe station still exists as the Waitara Railway Preservation Society purchased the line in 2001 and established its main base at Waitara Road.\nSince then passenger facilities have been reinstated (including 2 former NZR station buildings from Tahora and Waitōtara) and new sidings have been laid (including lifting and reusing the track from the Duncan and Davies siding).  Passenger services stop at the station during running days.\nThe neighbouring dairy factory complex still exists but is now used as a truck depot.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1882 Fort Collins earthquake or Front Range earthquake measured Mw 6.6 and struck near Fort Collins, Colorado at 1:30 UTC on November 8, which was 18:30 on the November 7. The earthquake occurred as the result of deformation within the Front Range and caused shaking as strong as Modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) VII (Very Strong). Shaking was felt as far away as Salt Lake City, Utah and Salina, Kansas. An aftershock struck locally at 04:45 on November 8 and was felt as far as Laramie, Wyoming and Meeker, Colorado. It is the largest earthquake in Colorado's history.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\nThe Southern Rocky Mountains are still actively growing due to the Laramide orogeny. The Front Range accommodates some of this as a deformation front of the orogeny. Stresses in this region are generally northwest–southeast oriented. The causative fault of this specific earthquake is unknown, but other earthquakes such as the 1984 Wyoming earthquake struck at a depth of 20 km (12 mi).\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe Mw 6.6 earthquake struck at 01:30 on November 8 in UTC time, or 18:30 on November 7. The earthquake caused Modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) VII (Very Strong) shaking in various localities near in the Front Range urban corridor and was felt over an area of 470,000 km2 (180,000 sq mi). Due to the sparseness of the epicentral region, very little is known about where exactly the earthquake occurred. An aftershock of magnitude 4.5 to 5.0 was also felt in the urban corridor. This earthquake is the largest known to have occurred in the state of Colorado.\n\n\n== Damage ==\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, plaster fell from the ceiling. In Denver, some bolts snapped and bent at an electric light plant. In La Porte, a wooden house suffered cracking. At Thompson, a house's walls were severely cracked and the plaster on some walls came off. Glass windows broke in Laramie.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKirkham, Robert M.; Rogers, William P. (1986).

        "content": "Ugo Coccia (11 August 1895 – 23 December 1932) was an Italian socialist journalist and politician who served as the secretary of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) for two terms from 1926 to 1928 and from 1930 to 1932. He died in exile in Hyères, France.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCoccia was born in Rieti on 11 August 1895. He started his socialist activities from young age. He was the editor of the Avanti! newspaper until 1928 when Angelica Balabanoff assumed the post.\nCoccia left Italy in 1926 when a strict law which ended the legal existence of the oppositional movements were put into force by the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini. Coccia continued his activities in Switzerland and France. He became the secretary of the PSI on 31 December 1926 succeeding Olindo Vernocchi in the post. Coccia's tenure ended on 15 January 1928 when Angelica Balabanoff was elected to the post. Coccia was elected secretary of the secretary of the PSI-IOS (Socialist Workers' International) at the unity congress held in Paris on 30 July 1930, replacing Pietro Nenni in the post. A secretariat committee composed of Oddino Morgari, Giuseppe Saragat and Angelo Tasca assumed the post on 2 September 1939.\nCoccia died in Hyères, France, on 23 December 1932, while serving as the secretary of the PSI-IOS, from heart disease resulting from a rheumatic disease which he contracted in the trenches during World War II.\nHis son, Franco Coccia (1929–2017), was also a politician.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA conference in memory of Coccia was organized by the Filippo Turati Foundation and the Pietro Nenni Foundation in his hometown, Rieti, on 12 March 1999. The papers presented at the conference were published as a book entitled Ugo Coccia e la generazione degli esuli (Italian: Ugo Coccia and the generation of exiles) in 2001.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

This makes Prang Khaek the oldest Angkorian temple in Lopburi and Central Thailand. It was possibly constructed by royal decree or by the order of local chieftains in the area. \n\nPrang Khaek was registered as a historical site by the Fine Arts Department on 2 August 1936, along the with adjacent Phra Prang Sam Yot.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nBuilt in the Khmer architectural style, the temple consists of three individual brick towers with a stucco exterior, arranged in a north–south direction facing the east, as is common in the Khmer style. Each tower has a single entrance and unlike the nearby Phra Prang Sam Yot, no internal corridors connect between each tower. The central tower is the largest and remnants of a Shiva linga has been discovered.\nIt was believed to be originally built only of brick, but during King Narai's reign, the structure was reinforced with stucco. Furthermore, two more structures were constructed in this period: a prayer hall (Vihara) at the front, and a water collection tank at the rear. These two newer structures were built in the Thai style with European influence as was popular at the time. In 1961, the Fine Arts Department reinforced the temple base with concrete. Today it stands on the traffic island at the intersection of Sura Songkhram and Wichayen Roads.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhra Prang Sam Yot\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pierre de Mornay (Latin: Petrus de Mornevo; died 29 May 1306) was a French bishop of Orleans (1288–1296) and Auxerre (1296–1306) and chancellor of France (1304–1306).\n\n\n== Life ==\nPierre de Mornay was the second son of Guillaume de Mornay, a knight whose estate was at Mornay near Nérondes in Berri (now Cher). His older brother Jean inherited the estate and became lord of Ferté-Nabert. Pierre studied law in Orléans. He may have served as the almoner of King Louis IX and served the Crown in some capacity under Philip III. He was a dean (French: doyen) of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois in Paris by 1278 and made archdeacon of Sologne and a canon of Orléans Cathedral in 1281. By 1286, he was a royal clerk (clerc) under Philip IV and he was elected bishop of Orléans on 23 December 1288. Two contested elections regarding the diocese of Auxerre were annulled by Pope Boniface VIII in 1294. He instead appointed the bishop of Orléans to hold the role in a bull dated 4 February 1296. \nPhilip IV was committed to strengthening the position of the king of France. Pierre had helped him negotiate the 1295 Treaty of Anagni, ending Franco-Aragonese fighting during the War of the Sicilian Vespers and bringing himself to papal attention. By 1295, the king's other efforts had begun a war with England over Aquitaine and caused unrest in Flanders. Philip IV responded in part by levying a 10% tax (decime) on church income without first securing the necessary approvals from the Papacy, as he had in 1288. Pierre de Mornay was obliged by the church to defend its position against the king, codified in the 1296 bull Clericis laicos. Philip IV responded with an embargo against any export of gold or silver from France, effectively cutting Rome off from its French revenue while the Colonna family revolted against Boniface. Boniface yielded over a series of bulls, threatening excommunication while effectively pledging to approve reasonable taxation in Ineffabilis amor, allowing \"voluntary\" \"donations\" from a country's clergy without papal approval during times of emergency in Romana mater ecclesia, and finally capitulating entirely to Philip's position in the 1297 Etsi de statu and canonization of Louis IX.\nPierre de Mornay was involved with negotiations with the English at Gisors in November 1297 with Guillaume de Mâcon, bishop of Amiens, John II, duke of Brittany, Guy de Chatillon, count of St-Pol and constable of France, and Raoul de Clermont, lord of Nesles; at Montreuil in 1299 with Gilles, archbishop of Narbonne, Robert II, duke of Burgundy, Pierre Flotte, Pierre de Belleperche, and Guy de Chatillon; and at Paris in 1302 and 1303 with the dukes of Brittany and Burgundy and with Philip's chamberlain Pierre the Fat. De Mornay was also involved in the negotiations to end the Franco-Flemish War and named Philip's chancellor in 1304.\nHe died at Régennes in Appoigny on 29 May 1306.\n\n\n== Arms ==\nHis coat of arms was listed as a black lion morné with gold crown over 8 bands of silver and gold (Fascé de huit pièces d'argent et de geueles, au lion morné de sable, couronné d'or, brochant sur le tout).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Gansuselache is a genus of extinct elasmobranch in the order Hybodontiformes, comprising one species, Gansuselache tungshengi (monotypy) from Gansu Province (Beishan Hills), China. It is known from Fangshankou Formation, which previously interpreted as Permian in age, but reinterpreted as the Early Triassic in later study. A tooth remain tentatively assigned to this genus is also known from Late Permian strata of Poland.\n\n\n== Description ==\nG. tungshengi is known from single specimen which is nearly complete and soft tissue is preserved. With total length reaching 49 centimetres (19 in) it had large spines on two dorsal fins as other hybodonts do. Although classification is uncertain, after tooth morphology, it is tentatively classified to Lonchidiidae.\n\n\n== Paleoecology ==\nGansuselache is known from Fangshankou Formation, which was originally considered as Permian. However, study in 2020 considered that this site and Early Triassic Hongyanjing Formation have same stratigraphic horizon, or even possible that fossils from two formations are known from same site. Those formations represent lake environment, although Fangshankou Formation have only one other fish taxon described (Eochondrosteus), Hongyanjing Formation produced multiple taxa such as several thousand specimens of actinopterygians (including Beishanichthys, Plesiofuro, Boreosomus), other hybodont which preserved narial and oral barbels, cynodont (Beishanodon), lizard-like diapsids, temnospondyls and possible late-surviving lepospondyl.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Zhidou D3 is an all-electric microcar manufactured by the Chinese manufacturer Zhidou between 2017 and 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of 2017, the Chinese automaker Zhidou presented a new, flagship model of the D3 microcar. The vehicle has expanded the offer as a larger, more spacious and more comfortable alternative to the existing range of D1, D2 and D2S models.\nSales of the D3 began in November 2017 on the domestic Chinese market. When it entered the European market in mid-2018, the car was also available in this region. In late 2021, failing Swedish startup Uniti used an example of the D3 to pitch it to investors as the company's planned new product instead of the unrealized One, modifying the exterior and changing its name to Uniti Zero. However, it was a one-time move that did not translate into mass production, and the company went bankrupt a short time later.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe D3 features a fully electric system that is powered by a 17 kWh (61 MJ) battery. This allows the vehicle to achieve a maximum range of up to 200 km (120 mi) on a single charge. At the front, the model is distinguished by a large, chrome element imitating the front grille, as well as narrow headlights. In the passenger cabin, there is rich equipment and a large touch screen.\n\n\n== References ==",

He worked in Japan and China from where he collected natural history specimens particularly of molluscs and art for German collectors.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nSchedel was born out of wedlock in Bamberg to physician Heinrich Heinkelmann (1807–1866) and Justina Wilhelmina Schedel (1837–1857), daughter of a Bamberg lawyer. His mother died shortly after his birth and he was raised by a laundress. He went to high school and then apprenticed at the Einhorn pharmacy from 1873. In 1880 he went to study natural sciences in Munich and in the next year he went to the University of Kiel and became a chemical assistant to August Friedrich Karl Himly. In 1884 he became a pharmacist near Charlottenburg. In 1886 he went to Japan to work with the Japan Dispensary Brett & Co and after his contract ended he purchased a French pharmacy that he converted to his own Deutsche Apotheke in Yokohama. He was a member of the German society for natural history and ethnology of east Asia and a friend of Otto Keil and German agent August Langfeldt. He returned to Germany in 1899 and gave talks about his experiences in Japan. In 1900 he moved to Munich and ran a pharmacy there but closed down in 1902 following attempted blackmail for homosexuality. He then moved through Bavaria and in 1909 and then moved to work in Tientsin, China. He did not like work conditions and his health was poor. In addition China declared war on Germany in 1917 and with serious nervous disorders he returned to Germany in 1922.  He lived in seclusion in Bamberg until his death.\nSchedel was a friend of Magnus Hirschfeld, who founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (WHC) in 1897. Schedel was invited to speak on homosexuality in Japan at the WHC in 1903. He also collected Japanese erotica. In 1925 he was awarded the \"Bene merenti\" medal of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences for his Chinese antiquities donated to the museum in Munich.\n\n\n== References ==",

Although it retained the form of a 3-door hatchback, it became significantly larger compared to the company's previously produced models. The body has gained characteristic, angular proportions with a narrow and slender body shape, thus reflecting visual features, including: competitive Wuling Hongguang Mini EV.\nThe Rainbow was built for the mainland Chinese market in mind, going on sale there a month after the presentation of the official technical specification, in April 2024.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe Rainbow is a fully electric car that offer two engines, a 27 hp (20 kW) engine or the more powerful one with 40 hp (30 kW). The former went on sale with a 17.18 kWh (61.8 MJ) battery offering a range in mixed mode of up to 201 km (125 mi) in CLTC mode, and the more powerful version was combined with a slightly larger 17.30 kWh (62.3 MJ) battery allowing a range of up to 205 km (127 mi).\nDespite the small, 3.2-meter body, there is space inside for 4 passengers in two rows of seats. The passenger cabin was kept in a light tone combining white with body-colored accents, with a two-spoke steering wheel and two displays serving as a digital instrument panel and a centrally placed touch screen of the multimedia system.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Here is a wiki-text format entry for Wikipedia about the Liangguang Incident:\n\n\n=== Liangguang Incident ===\nThe Liangguang Incident (兩廣事變) was a political crisis in 1936 in which the warlords of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, chen Jitang and Bai Chongxi respectively, conspired to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. It is seen as a prelude to the more famous Xi'an Incident later that year involving the kidnapping of Chiang.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1936, Chen Jitang's biggest political supporter, Hu Hanmin, died. Chiang Kai-shek saw this as an opportunity to weaken Chen further by suggesting an end to Guangdong's autonomy under Chen's control. Chen reacted by conspiring with the New Guangxi clique led by Bai Chongxi to overthrow Chiang, using the pretext of Chiang's failure to effectively confront Japanese aggression in Manchuria and northern China.\n\n\n== Events ==\nChen and Bai's plot to overthrow Chiang proved counterproductive, as many of Chen's own forces saw it as undermining the need for national unity against the growing Japanese threat. Notable defections from Chen's camp to the central Nationalist government included the future ace fighter pilot Guan Zhiliu. \nOver the following months, political maneuvering, bribery, defections, and negotiations occurred between the various factions. The situation was eventually resolved peacefully in July 1936 when Chen resigned his position in Guangdong and fled to Hong Kong. Guangxi abandoned the anti-Chiang conspiracy in September.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Liangguang Incident highlighted the tenuous hold that Chiang's central government had over regional warlords and militaries in 1930s China. It foreshadowed the Xi'an Incident later in 1936, in which Chiang was briefly kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng in an attempt to force him to united with the Communist forces against Japan.\nDespite these challenges to his authority, Chiang was able to project a image of eventually establishing unified control and leading China's defense against full-scale Japanese invasion after 1937.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nChen Jitang",

        "content": "Khoja Ali Shah (died 30 May 1358) was the Eretnid vizier by 1353 until his revolt against the ruler Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad I (r. 1353–66). Upon Eretna's (r. 1335–53) death, Khoja Ali secretly invited Muhammad to Kayseri to become the new sultan, although Muhammad's older brother Jafar was already residing there. Jafar was imprisoned by Muhammad for some time, but he eventually escaped to Egypt. Muhammad's rule did not fare well, and he was ousted from the throne in 1354.\nIn April 1355, Muhammad faced Jafar at the Battle of Yalnızgöz. He came to terms with Khoja Ali Shah. According to historian Kemal Göde, Muhammad later reversed into conflict with Khoja Ali Shah, whom he killed near Zamantu on 30 May 1358. This deviates from İsmail Hakkı Uzunçarşılı's earlier work which explains that Khoja Ali Shah led an uprising against Muhammad in 1364 and marched towards Kayseri. Muhammad was defeated and had to request assistance from the Mamluk Sultan Al-Kamil Sha'ban. Upon a decree by the Mamluk Sultan, the governor of Aleppo sent his forces to aid Muhammad, with which he subdued and executed Khoja Ali Shah in 1365.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nÇayırdağ, Mehmet (August 2000). \"Eretnalı Beyliğinin Paraları\" [Coinage of the Eretna Principality].

        "content": "The North Alabama Lions beach volleyball team represents the University of North Alabama in the Atlantic Sun Conference. They are currently led by head coach Kaleb VanDePerre and play their home games at the UNA Beach Volleyball Courts.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeach volleyball was added as a sport at UNA in 2019. It was added along with women's golf to keep the amount of sports sponsored at 14 as both women's indoor and outdoor track programs were discontinued.\nBob White served as the first head coach of the program in 2019 as an addition to his duties as the indoor volleyball coach. In the inaugural season, the Lions won their first match in a faceoff against the Huntington Hawks.  The Lions would also win their first ever home match against in-state rival Jacksonville State.\nIn 2021, assistant coach Thais Yancey took over as head coach and led UNA to its first ever winning season.\nBefore the 2023 season, Kaleb VanDePerre was brought on as the new head coach as Yancey returned to her previous position as assistant coach. VanDePerre, who was previously the head coach at Liberty University, was brought on in an effort to separate indoor and beach volleyball.\nIn 2023, the Lions earned their first 20-win season. They made it to the ASUN quarterfinals where they lost to North Florida. The year also saw the team's first All-ASUN First Team selection with the pair of Paula Klemperer and Taylor Seney.\nIn 2024, the team won their first ever matches against Power 5 programs. The Lions sweep the Oregon Ducks 5–0 in the Green Wave Invitational in New Orleans.  They would also go on to sweep the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the Tiger Beach Classic in Baton Rouge.\n2024 also saw the Lions set a new record for season wins as they finished 22–16. In the ASUN tournament, they made it to the semifinals before losing to FGCU.\nThe season also saw multiple honors awarded to the Lions. Coach VanDePerre won the ASUN Coach of the Year, which is the first time a coach at UNA has won the honor in the Division I era. Paula Klemperer and Taylor Seney was selected to the ASUN First Team for the second straight year. They were also joined by the pair of Katy Floyd and Selma Robinson.\n\n\n== Season-by-season results ==\n\nSource:\n\n\n== All-time records ==\n\n\n=== Individual career wins ===\nRecords as of April 16, 2024 \n\n\n=== Pair career wins ===\nRecords as of April 16, 2024 \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Meet the Grahams\" is a diss track by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on May 3, 2024, during his ongoing feud with Canadian rapper Drake. It is Lamar's response to Drake's single Family Matters. It premiered approximately 52 minutes after the release of Drake's \"Family Matters\", a diss track mainly aimed at Lamar.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDrake, born Aubrey Drake Graham, has an immediate family including his parents, Sandra and Dennis Graham, and Adonis, Drake's son with Sophie Brussaux. Adonis was initially kept from the public eye but was confirmed by Drake after rapper Pusha T alleged his existence on the diss track \"The Story of Adidon\". The feud between Drake and Lamar began in March 2024, with Lamar attacking Drake's persona and skill with the songs \"Like That\" and \"Euphoria\", before Drake responded with the track \"Family Matters\" in which he accused Lamar of domestic violence against longtime partner Whitney Alford.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nProduced by the Alchemist, \"Meet the Grahams\", unlike Lamar's previous responses, takes on an unsettling, haunting atmosphere, with an eerie piano-driven beat accompanying critical lyrics accusing Drake of a number of wrongdoings including parental negligence, sexual exploitation, and another incident of child abandonment.\nThe track's lyrics take the form of a letter with multiple verses addressed at members of Drake's family. The first verse is addressed to Drake's son Adonis, the second is addressed to Dennis and Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham, both of Drake's parents, the third is addressed to Drake's alleged daughter, and the last verse is addressed to Drake himself. In the song, Lamar alleges that Drake has a secret child, a daughter, and calls him a sexual predator. Lamar also mentions that Drake is allegedly running a sex trafficking ring out of his Toronto mansion, known as The Embassy, and compares his actions to those of former film producer and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe cover art used in the original YouTube release shows an uncropped version of the photo that accompanied Lamar's previous song, \"6:16 in LA\". In addition to the glove, it shows a shirt, jewelry receipts, and three prescription medicines with the name \"Aubrey Graham\" (Drake's real name) on them, including one for Ozempic and one for Zolpidem. According to DJ Akademiks, these items were stolen from a suitcase belonging to Drake's father, Dennis Graham. The song was released to streaming platforms the next day with the original artwork being replaced with a black square, possibly due to Apple Music and Spotify guidelines prohibiting the sharing of personal information, as with the pill bottles in the original artwork, as well as the display of brands or advertisements on cover art.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nKendrick Lamar – vocals, songwriting\nThe Alchemist – production\nNicolas De Porcel – mastering\nJohnathan Turner – mixing\nRay Charles Brown Jr. – engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of notable diss tracks\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Forgiveness Is Yours is the fourth studio album of the British post-punk band, Fat White Family, released on 26 April 2024 by Domino. It is the band's first album without Saul Adamczewski.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nForgiveness Is Yours received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on seven reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nAt Slant Magazine, Steve Erickson stated that, \"Fat White Family may have dropped some of the more antagonistic aspects of their image and adopted a slightly slicker sound, but their anger is still very palpable. Music isn’t worth performing, they seem to suggest, if it doesn’t risk pissing people off, or at least challenging the listener’s complacency. With Forgiveness Is Yours, Saoudi and company achieve that objective—with a patina of sophistication.\" In the review for NME, Jordan Bassett wrote about  Fat White Family's artistic switch from music that was \"more invested in offending their audience than crafting up much of a tune\" to music that he states is more respectable and \"burrows down the rabbit-hole of respectability.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This changed when in 1998, Plymouth and Torbay were separated from the county council to become unitary authorities.\nIn early 2022, Devon, Plymouth and Torbay were selected as one of nine pilot areas in England by the UK government in the Levelling Up White Paper for \"County Deal\" negotiations. However, Plymouth City Council decided to withdraw from the deal in November 2023.\nDevon and Torbay proceeded without Plymouth with a joint proposal for a Level 2 Devolution Deal, a Combined Authority without a directly elected mayor. The deal was approved by both Devon County Council and Torbay Council and submitted to the Secretary of State for approval in early May 2024. The DTCCA is scheduled to be created in the Autumn of 2024 following parliamentary approval. \n\n\n== Membership ==\nThere will be 12 members: 6 constituent members with full voting rights, 4 non-constituent members who do not have voting powers unless extended to them by the constituent members, and 2 associate members who cannot vote under any circumstance.\nThe six constituent members will be elected by Devon County Council and Torbay Council, who will each choose half.\nTwo of the non-constituent members will be selected collectively by the various district councils of Devon to represent their interests and one is reserved for the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner. The remaining non-constituent member and the two associate members are elected by the constituent members of the DTCCA.\nThere are provisions to expand the membership should Plymouth City Council join the DTCCA in the future.\n\n\n== References ==",

He showed promise as a soccer centre-half and was signed by Leicester City, but his time there was brief and he started playing rugby for North of Ireland on his return to Belfast. Capped twice for Ireland, Armstrong appeared against the Springboks in 1960 and England the following year, both as a fly-half. He also represented Ulster in basketball.\nArmstrong taught at the Royal School Dungannon for 28 years and served as head of PE, before retiring in 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKen Armstrong at ESPNscrum",

The fourth, known as both \"Shug\" and \"Z\", remained on the loose for nearly a week before being rescued. Z was captured in good condition, but some people questioned the method.\nInitially believed to be a stallion, two mares, and a filly, it was later confirmed there were three mares and a filly. King County Regional Animal Services was involved. Z was later seen in South Fork, then southeast of Riverbend. A cougar was seen along the same trail as Z. Animal control officers stopped actively searching, and asked the public to stay away from the zebra, later seen in the Boxley Creek area.\n\n\n== Public reaction ==\nThe event trended on social media, with local businesses and organizations posting about the zebra. Many artificial intelligence-generated images, memes, and photoshopped media were created. Some businesses offered zebra \"specials\" or custom products as a result of the escape.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Family Matters\" is a diss track by Canadian rapper Drake, released on May 3, 2024. The track serves as a response to several songs (\"Champagne Moments\", \"All to Myself\", \"Show of Hands\", \"Euphoria\", and \"6:16 in LA\"). Drake targets several rappers, such as Kendrick Lamar, Future, Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, along with singer, The Weeknd, and record producer, Metro Boomin. Kendrick Lamar responded to \"Family Matters\" within an hour with the song \"Meet the Grahams\".\n\n\n== Background and release ==\n\nDrake posted a remix of \"Buried Alive Interlude\", a song off his 2011 album Take Care which features Kendrick Lamar, as a promo for \"Family Matters\" on his official Instagram. In the short snippet Drake parodies Lamar perfomance on the original track and further disses him.\nThe single was released by Drake on May 3, 2024 on all streaming platforms along with an accompanying music video on YouTube.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe \"Family Matters\" music video by Drake is laden with symbolism, beginning with Drake's homage to 50 Cent with a vintage G-Unit spinner chain and his response to Lamar's mention of FUBU in \"Euphoria\". The video features a third generation Plymouth Voyager, reminiscent of the third generation Chrysler Town & Country featured on the cover of the deluxe edition of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, being crushed in a junkyard, symbolizing Drake's intention to bury Kendrick. Drake then flaunts jewelry from Pharrell's collection, including Tupac's ring, suggesting the ongoing narrative of their feud. References to Lamar's personal life emerge with cakes inscribed with \"Happy Divorce\" and \"Happy Co-parenting,\" implying a split from Alford due to infidelity. Scenes of Drake in the studio, a Michael Jackson action figure highlighting \"Black and White,\" and Drake wearing a ringed chain hint at deeper meanings, such as speculation about Lamar's engagement to Alford. The music video also shows Drake visiting the New Ho King Chinese restaurant referenced by Lamar in Euphoria.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nLamar released his response song \"Meet the Grahams\" 20 minutes after the release  of \"Family Matters\".\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Life Eater is a 2024 video game developed by Strange Scaffold and published by Strange Scaffold and Frosty Pop for Windows. The game is a narrative horror puzzle game in which players are a murderer that use an interactive timeline to learn the routines and vulnerabilities of their victims. The game was concepted by independent developer Xalavier Nelson Jr, who aimed to create a \"horror fantasy kidnapping simulator\" that explored themes of surveillance in a fantasy horror context. Upon release, Life Eater received mixed to average reviews from critics, with reviewers noting the impact and ambition of its premise, but expressing mixed views on the effect of its gameplay and narrative to execute its concept.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nLife Eater is a puzzle game in which the player is a murderer that uses an interactive timeline similar to video editing software to plan an opportunity to abduct a specific victim nominated at the start of every stage. Each round of the game takes place over two phases. The first phase, set out on a timeline representing the routines of one or more victims. The timeline of each victim is segmented by empty slots representing their various activities throughout the days of the week. To uncover these activities and locate the appropriate opportunity to kidnap them, players select a series of actions that represent methods of stalking them. These actions are constrained by a time limit and suspicion meter, requiring the player to manage their time and not raise the meter. Once the suspicion meter passes a threshold three times, or the time limit runs out, the game is over. Some activities on the timeline can only be revealed by taking more intrusive actions as greater cost to time and suspicion. Players can reduce the level of suspicion by undertaking activities at cost to their available time. Once the player identifies a sufficient percentage of the victim's activities in that week, they are able to select a victim to abduct.\nThe second phase of the game presents the player with statements about the correct victim, requiring them to demonstrate knowledge from the evidence they collected in the first phase of the game. Players answer these questions using an interface representing the sacrifice of the victim, removing certain bodily organs based on whether or not the victim met certain conditions such as their habits, living status and appearance. If the player removes the organs correctly based on these conditions, the player is successful, otherwise they must restart the stage. Certain conditions, such as whether the victim lived alone, requires the player to infer the nature of the victim based upon the evidence they have collected, occasionally from the habits of other characters that have been surveilled. As the game progresses, multiple characters are able to be monitored or abducted in the first phase of the game. The instructions on which targets are to be abducted also can be abstract, such as to \"find a monster\", requiring deeper investigation to abduct the correct victim.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player character, Ralph, is a \"modern-day Druid\" in servitude to Zimforth, a god that threatens to bring about the end of the world unless the player provides them with annual sacrifices. To meet these ends, Ralph abducts and murders specific targets identified by Zimforth by monitoring their personal lives and routines. He also abducts and imprisons a victim, Johnny, placing him in a cage. Over the years in service to Zimforth, Ralph develops increasing paranoia and guilt about their involvement in procuring sacrifices as they develop a one-sided friendship with Johnny. Throughout the game, it is left ambiguous as to whether Ralph is sane or truly  tormented by the demands of Zimforth.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nLife Eater was developed by Strange Scaffold, the studio of independent developer Xalavier Nelson Jr. Life Eater was developed following the developer securing a five-game publishing contract with independent publisher Frosty Pop. Nelson Jr. stated that the concept arose from the desire to create a \"kidnapping sim\" with a horror-fantasy theme using timeline-based games like those used in John Wick Hex. The game intended to explore the \"dark and interesting design questions\" arising from the exploitation of \"information culture\" and surveillance, such as geotagging, to use for harm. The Saw film series and 10 Cloverfield Lane were also cited as inspiration for the concept of the game. Life Eater was announced with the release of a trailer on 6 March 2024, and released on 16 April.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Life Eater received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics. Whilst all critics acknowledged the ambition and uniqueness of the game's concept,  they expressed mixed views on the execution on its gameplay mechanics. Andy Brown of NME considered the gameplay to be \"deeply immersive\" in its details, but felt its repetitive mechanics became \"formulaic\" and \"frustrating\" by the end of the game. Similarly describing the gameplay as \"routine\" and \"shallow\", Zoey Handley of Destructoid critiqued the lack of instructions and trial-and-error gameplay. Ben Sledge of TheGamer felt the gameplay was \"left wanting\" in practice, stating that the reliance of the game on memory was \"repetitive\" and \"frustrating\". Rob Gordon of Screen Rant noted the \"unique and innovative\" aspects of gameplay, but felt that its execution lacked complexity, had a \"barren\" presentation not supplemented by imagery or animation, and resulted in frustrating trial and error. Aaron Boehm of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the game \"struggles to balance the abstract nature of the mechanics with the narrative it’s trying to tell\". Kelsey Raynor of VG247 found the game to become \"trivial\" and \"easy\" once the mechanics of the game were learned by the player, although considered this issue to be minor due to the short playtime of the game.\nReviewers also provided mixed assessments about the game's narrative. Rob Gordon of Screen Rant commended the game's \"impressive\" and \"well-written\" narrative, highlighting its \"oppressive atmosphere\". Aaron Boehm of Bloody Disgusting also praised the depiction of the relationship between the player character and Johnny, citing the \"warmth and relatability\" in the writing style and its treatment of themes of \"questioning your faith and how far you let your devotion take you\". Ben Sledge of TheGamer found the game to have an \"exemplary script\", craft \"simple, emotional stories\" through its gameplay, and illustrate a \"manipulative and transformative\" depiction of the player character's descent into inhumanity. Noting the uncomfortable aspects of its intriguing and effective premise, Robert Purchese of Eurogamer felt the game \"struggled to wrap a story around it\" nor explore deeper topics, conclusions or consequences for the player's behavior. Andy Brown of NME praised the game's \"unsettling story\" and its \"compelling\" themes of \"faith, love and duty\", highlighting the cutscenes and voiceover performances. In spite of a \"compelling and disturbing\" premise, Zoey Handley of Destructoid noted that the \"simple and distant\" gameplay failed to connect with its characters, making it difficult for her \"to care about the world or the people who inhabit it\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Market Street is a downtown street in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. It runs for around 1.6 miles (2.6 km), from Main Street, at the Union County/Northumberland County line, in the east to North Fairground Road in the west. It is part of Pennsylvania Route 45. West of its intersection with Derr Drive (U.S. Route 15), it is named West Market Street. From the Susquehanna River inland, Market Street's cross streets are numbered 2 through 8, with Front Street replacing what was originally 1st Street. These cross streets are named \"North\" or \"South\" depending on their location relative to Main Street. Lewisburg's street layout was designed by Ludwig Derr in 1785, and is believed to have been inspired by that of Philadelphia.\nThe street is part of the Lewisburg Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Packwood House-American Hotel (1813), the Chamberlin Iron Front Building (1868), Copper Beech Manor (1857) and the William Cameron Home (1887) are each on Market Street. Throughout the nine blocks of the Historic Market Street Corridor, 115 of the 125 buildings are classified as being contributing structures to the historic character of the district.\nIn 1915, the borough installed the three-globe cast-iron street lights along Market Street.\n\n\n== Notable addresses ==\n\nFrom east to west:\n\n5 Market Street (1840)\nPackwood House-American Hotel, 10 Market Street (1813)\n12 Market Street (1799)\nCopper Beech Manor, 17 Market Street (1857)\nFirst Presbyterian Church, 18 Market Street (1856)\n35 Market Street (1829)\n43 Market Street (1828)\n100 Market Street (1819)\n101 Market Street (1825)\n124 Market Street (1820)\n129 Market Street (1845)\nLewisburg Hotel, 136 Market Street (1834)\nWilliam Cameron House, 137 Market Street (1887)\n217–223 Market Street (1850)\n239 Market Street (1915)\nPost Office and Court House, 301 Market Street (1933)\nUnion National Bank Building, 311 Market Street (1899)\n314–316 Market Street (1864)\nLewisburg National Bank Building, 409 Market Street (1927)\nCampus Theatre, 413 Market Street (1941)\nChamberlin Iron Front Building, 434–440 Market Street (1868)\n437–439 Market Street (1857)\nHufnagle Park, between South 5th Street and South 6th Street\n600 Market Street\n617 Market Street (1890)\n629 Market Street (1850)\n700–702 Market Street (1850)\n701 Market Street (1865)\n715 Market Street (1856)\n721 Market Street (1870)\n727 Market Street (1800)\n729 Market Street (1870)\n\n\n== References ==",

The structure is made from stone blocks and has a wooden beams sustaining the ceiling. In the facade is an oculus, and an awkward portico was added in the 16th-century. The sail-type bell tower above the apse was added in 1598\nInside is a painted cross, poorly conserved, dating to the 12th century is kept in the church; it putatively derives from the Monastery of San Galgano in Chiusdino. Two tablets depicting Saints Atinia and Greciniana, two of the few remaining parts of the altar made by Cosimo Daddi. A 15th-century-tabernacle is located on the right wall of the presbytery.

Launched in 2013, it was the first such magazine in France. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2013, Bande à part became the first cinema magazine specifically designed for tablet computers in France. Unlike simple PDF versions of print magazines or adaptations of existing websites, the magazine plays with formatting and content presentation, while offering a touch navigation mode adaptable to different reading styles. Drawing inspiration from the Apple iPad's release in 2010, Anne-Claire Cieutat and Fouzi Louahem created a magazine that leverages tablet graphics for a cinematic approach, breaking away from traditional criticism. The title of the magazine is directly inspired by the Louvre traversal sequence in the film of the same name by Jean-Luc Godard—in which the main characters dash through the halls of the famous museum.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nBande à part is one of the 55 websites used for film ratings on AlloCiné in the press review section.\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\nDigital Magazine Awards 2013: \"Best New Magazine\" Award.\nDigital Magazine Awards 2014: \"Best Magazine for Film, TV, and Entertainment\" Award.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Externals links ==",

His businesses include Beatbox Kitchen, All Day Donuts, and Juanita Peaches, and Taco Truck. Prior to starting food trucks, he sold clothing at various music gigs under the label 'Blank TM'. He later travelled the United States as a photographer, and photographed J Dilla. Through his travels in the US he saw how prevalent food trucks were in that country, and upon his return to Melbourne he set up the city's first hamburger truck 'Beatbox Kitchen'. The truck debuted at Meredith music festival. He has been described by the Herald Sun as 'the founding father of Melbourne's food truck scene'.\nHis first beatbox kitchen truck started in 2009, (then called 'Beatbox burgers') in Brunswick.\nIn 2017 beatbox kitchen opened a permanent location, and in 2021 it closed down. The trucks continue to operate.\nIn 2020 he started an online cooking show named 'Raph's mean cuisine', featuring various guests from Melbourne's food scene.\n\n\n== References ==",

The teams who finished in 3rd to 6th place in the Championship and League One and the 4th to 7th-placed teams in League Two compete. The winners of the semi-finals advance to the finals, with the winners gaining promotion for the following season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe English Football League play-offs have been held every year since 1987. They take place for each division following the conclusion of the regular season and are contested by the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places. The fixtures are determined by final league position – in the Championship and League One this is 3rd v 6th and 4th v 5th, while in League Two it is 4th v 7th and 5th v 6th.\n\n\n== Championship ==\n\n\n=== Championship semi-finals ===\nThe final table was confirmed after the final matchday on 4 May 2024. Going into the final day, Southampton had already confirmed their place in their play-offs by finishing 4th. Leeds United could only secure automatic promotion if they beat Southampton and Ipswich Town lost to Huddersfield Town. In the end, Leeds United missed out on automatic promotion after losing to Southampton, confirming they would finish 3rd. Ipswich Town won their match against Huddersfield. Norwich City, West Bromwich Albion, and Hull City were all in the hunt for the last two spots. West Bromwich Albion leapfrogged Norwich City to 5th after beating Preston North End. Despite their loss to relegation-threatened Birmingham City, Norwich City managed to finish 6th after Hull City also lost against Birmingham City's relegation rivals Plymouth Argyle.\n\nFirst leg\n\nSecond leg\n\n\n=== Championship final ===\n\n\n== League One ==\n\n\n=== League One semi-finals ===\nThe final table was confirmed after the final matchday on 27 April 2024. Going into the final day, Bolton Wanderers had already qualified for the play-offs but still had a chance of automatic promotion. However, a Derby County win prevented that possibility. In the end, they drew with Peterborough United, who had also already guaranteed their place in the play-offs  to finish 3rd and 4th respectively. The final day also saw a four-way battle between Barnsley, Oxford United, Lincoln City and Blackpool for the final two spots. In the end, Oxford United secured 5th with a win over Exeter City while Barnsley's draw with Northampton Town proved enough to finish 6th as Lincoln City and Blackpool lost to Champions Portsmouth and Reading respectively to miss out.\n\nFirst leg\n\nSecond leg\n\nBolton Wanderers won 5–4 on aggregate.\n\nOxford United won 2–1 on aggregate.\n\n\n=== League One final ===\n\n\n== League Two ==\n\n\n=== League Two semi-finals ===\nThe final table was confirmed after the final matchday on 27 April 2024. Going into the final day, Milton Keynes Dons had already secured a play-off place and were confirmed to finish 4th. The remaining three places were under contention between Doncaster Rovers, Crewe Alexandra, Crawley Town, Barrow and Bradford City. Thanks to Doncaster Rovers' spectacular run from February onwards, where they only lost once coupled with a 10-match win streak, a draw against Gillingham was enough to see them finish 5th. A draw against Colchester United was also enough for Crewe Alexandra to secure 6th. Crawley Town's win over Grimsby Town saw them take 7th as Barrow's draw against Mansfield Town meant they would drop out off the play-offs. All these results meant that Bradford City's win over Newport County would not be enough to see them over the line.\n\nFirst leg\n\nSecond leg\n\n2–2 on aggregate, Crewe Alexandra won 4–3 on penalties.\n\nCrawley Town won 8–1 on aggregate\n\n\n=== League Two final ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Loraine Leeson Campbell (1905-1982) was an American birth control activist known for her leadership in the Massachusetts birth control movement during the mid-20th century. Serving as president of both the Birth Control League of Massachusetts and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Campbell played a significant role in advocating for increased access to contraceptive services and the legalization of birth control in Massachusetts. Despite encountering opposition, including from the Roman Catholic Church, her efforts contributed to advancements in contraception rights within the state. Additionally, her involvement as a mediator within the birth control movement played a part in achieving legal victories on a national level, such as the Griswold v. Connecticut Supreme Court decision, which established a constitutional right to privacy regarding contraception.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nLoraine Leeson was born on May 12, 1905, in Newton Center, Massachusetts, to Robert Ainsworth Leeson, a corporate executive, and Mildred Dix. She hailed from a socially prominent Boston family and received her education at the Winsor School, where she demonstrated academic and athletic excellence, eventually becoming student body president. \nIn 1928, her mother passed away, followed by her grandmother, Mrs. Emily F. Dix, in 1943. Mrs. Dix's will specified that all her possessions were to be equally shared among Loraine Leeson and her siblings – Robert Leeson, Mrs. Marlon Leeson Morey, and Alfred Dix Leeson. Additionally, Mrs. Dix bestowed significant sums during her lifetime to her daughter, Mildred Dix Leeson.\nAfter graduating from Winsor, Leeson enrolled at Vassar College in 1924, majoring in psychology and graduating in 1928. During her time at Vassar, she engaged in activism, including participation in pickets during strikes, which surprised her parents. Despite her involvement in activism, she earned academic honors, being elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and also served as student body president. Following the passing of her mother during her senior year, Leeson declined job offers for child development research and instead returned to Boston to assist in raising her three younger siblings.\n\n\n=== Early involvement in the birth control movement ===\nLeeson's early involvement in the birth control movement was motivated by her aspiration to conduct research on language development in brain-damaged children. To pursue this goal, she rented space in the laboratory of Stanley Cobb at Harvard Medical School, despite facing administrative objections within Cobb's department. During this period, Leeson established relationships with members of the Harvard medical community who were actively engaged in providing contraceptive services to the indigent through birth control clinics.\nIn 1934, Leeson married Walter E. Campbell, an architect, and the couple had three sons. Marriage provided Leeson with social acceptance, allowing her to assume leadership positions within the Massachusetts birth control movement. She served as vice president of the state league and chaired the executive committee of the state's first birth control clinic.\n\n\n=== Advocacy for birth control in Massachusetts ===\nIn the late 1920s, a coalition of birth control advocates in Massachusetts rallied around Antoinette Konikow, a physician arrested for delivering a lecture on family planning. This spurred the formation of the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, which sought legislative changes in 1931 to the Comstock law, aiming to grant physicians the ability to provide contraceptive information to married patients. Faced with legislative inertia, the birth control proponents established a clinic in Brookline in 1932 to offer services to those without access to private care. Over subsequent years, a network of seven clinics across the state provided contraceptive services to thousands of women. However, this growing activity encountered opposition from the Roman Catholic clergy, leading to police raids in 1937 that closed the clinics.\nUndeterred, birth control advocates adjusted their strategy, pursuing legal avenues and ballot initiatives. Loraine Leeson, played a significant role within the movement since the 1940s, mainly participating in public awareness campaigns. She served as president of the league from 1940-1943 and 1945-1949, seeking support from the Massachusetts Medical Society. However, reform measures in 1942 and 1948 faced narrow defeats in voter referendums, reflecting opposition from Catholic quarters to the legalization of contraception.\nFrom 1949 to 1952, she served as a member of the board of directors of the Civil Liberties Union, Massachusetts. Additionally, from 1944 to 1945, she served on the board of overseers of Shady Hill School in Cambridge.\nLeeson's persistence in advocating for legal access to birth control in Massachusetts eventually saw success in the 1960s, with the passage of a reform bill recognizing the legality of medically prescribed contraception. Additionally, she contributed to national efforts with Planned Parenthood, serving as a director from 1941-1969 and as president from 1956-1959.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nIn the 1970s, as Cold War-era population control advocates sought to align Planned Parenthood with their agenda, Leeson reaffirmed the movement's foundation in humanitarian concern for women's rights, while also finding ways to address their worries about rapid population growth.  She passed away in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1982. She is survived by her husband, Walter E. Campbell; three sons: Leeson of Dedham, Dix McDill of Belmont, and Charles Lanning Campbell of Colorado Springs, Colorado; a brother, A. Dix Leeson of Cuttyhunk; as well as six grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nReed, James W.

        "content": "Crutarndina is a monotypic fungal genus in the family Graphidaceae. It contains the single species Crutarndina petractoides, a corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichen.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe sole species of Crutarndina was first formally described in 1995 by Per Magnus Jørgensen and Irwin Brodo, who originally classified it in the genus Thelotrema. Sittiporn Parnmen, Robert Lücking, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch circumscribed the genus Crutarndina in 2012 to contain the species after molecular phylogenetics analysis showed that it represented a unique lineage.\nThe genus name Crutarndina honours the eminent British lichenologist Peter Crittenden from Nottingham, who assisted in collecting the type material during a field excursion organized by the British Lichen Society. The surname Crittenden originates from Old British and Welsh, translating to \"the cot on the lower hill,\" combining \"cru\" (cot), \"tarn\" (lower), and \"dun\" or \"din\" (hill).\n\n\n== Description ==\nCrutarndina is distinguished from the closely related genus Thelotrema primarily by its unique apothecial structure. In Crutarndina, the fruiting bodies (apothecia) have star-like, multi-layered margins, which differ significantly from those observed in Thelotrema. The thallus, or body, of Crutarndina lichens lacks a cortex, meaning it does not have a protective outer layer. The apothecia are erumpent, meaning they break through the thallus surface as they develop, and they are generally rounded in shape. The central disc of the apothecia is largely hidden by the surrounding exciple. This exciple is strikingly star-like and has multiple layers, adding to the distinct appearance of the lichen.\nThe exciple varies in composition, being hyaline (transparent) at the base but becoming carbonised (turning to a black, carbon-rich compound) towards the top. The ascospores, which are the reproductive spores formed in the asci (spore-producing cells), are fusiform (spindle-shaped) and transversely septate, meaning they have multiple cross walls (septa). These walls are thickened, and the spaces between them are lens-shaped to rounded, a feature described as distoseptate. The spores are colourless and react positively to iodine staining (I+). Crutarndina does not produce secondary metabolites (lichen products).\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nCrutarndina petractoides is predominantly found in oceanic regions, growing on the somewhat shaded, smooth bark of trees, especially Corylus (hazel) and Sorbus (rowan). While it may occasionally colonise other broadleaved trees, it primarily grows in the sheltered woodlands and boggy areas of temperate rainforests. The species is locally abundant in Western Scotland and Western and Southwestern Ireland. It is, however, very rare in North Wales and Cumbria.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The German Inquisition was established by Pope Gregory IX in 1231, and the first inquisitor was appointed in the territory of Germany. In the second half of the 14th century, permanent structures of the Inquisition were organized in Germany, which, with the exception of one tribunal, survived only until the time of the Reformation in the first half of the 16th century. In combating heretics in Germany, the Inquisition always played a secondary role compared to the ecclesiastical courts.\nGeographically, the jurisdictional area of the German Inquisition from 14th to 16th century encompassed the ecclesiastical metropolitan provinces: Mainz, Cologne, Salzburg, Bremen, and Magdeburg, as well as the Archdiocese of Trier (without suffragans), the Diocese of Basel (belonging to the province of Besançon), exempted dioceses of Bamberg, Meissen, and Pomerania, as well as the Livonian territories belonging to the Teutonic Order. Burgundy and Lorraine, and until 1515 also southern Netherlands, although part of the Holy Roman Empire, were subject to French inquisitors appointed by the provincial of the Dominicans in Paris.\n\n\n== Heretics in Germany from 11th to 13th century ==\nThe first mention of heretics in late medieval Germany dates back to 1051 when Emperor Henry III, against the protests of Catholic clergy, ordered the hanging of several individuals in Goslar who were deemed Manicheans due to their refusal to kill animals and consume meat. However, little is known about this group. Around 1114/1115, Tanchelm of Utrecht operated in the diocese of Utrecht, who was also accused of heresy. However, it is more likely that he was merely a radical and tactless religious reformer who antagonized the corrupt clergy of Utrecht too much. In any case, after his murder in 1115, his movement collapsed. From 1143 onwards, the presence of the dualistic Cathar sect was recorded in the Rhineland, which from the beginning met with hostile reception. In 1143, Count Otto von Rheineck burned three Cathars in Bonn, and in the same and following years, there were extrajudicial punishments of Cathars captured in Cologne and Liège. At that time, too, the Catholic clergy was opposed to the persecution of heretics. In 1163, there were again extrajudicial punishments of Cathars in Cologne, and shortly thereafter, they were expelled from Mainz. However, it seems that this sect did not establish lasting roots in Germany. Evidence of its presence in Germany in the first half of the 13th century is ambiguous, and later it is absent altogether.\nA much greater role in the history of German heterodoxy before the Reformation was played by the Waldensian movement, which from the end of the 12th century gained an increasingly wide following, particularly in the Rhineland, Austria, and Bavaria, and later also in Brandenburg and Pomerania. It was against the Waldensians that one of the first organized large-scale repressive actions was directed. In 1212, Bishop Heinrich Veringen of Strasbourg discovered Waldensians in his diocese and, as a result of the investigation conducted, identified as many as 500 suspects, 80 of whom were burned at the stake.\nIn March 1232, Emperor Frederick II officially ordered that all people guilty of heresy in Germany should be punished by death by burning at the stake unless they submitted to the Church.\n\n\n== Konrad von Marburg ==\n\nFrom 1227 onwards, sermons against heretics in Germany were preached by Konrad von Marburg, the confessor of Elisabeth of Thuringia. In October 1231, Pope Gregory IX expanded his mandate, appointing him as a delegate judge to combat heretics. In this way, Konrad became the first papal inquisitor in history, although formally both before and after this date he was only titled as Praedicator Verbi Dei (Preacher of the Word of God), not as Inquisitor haereticae pravitatis (Inquisitor of Heretical Perversity), as was the official title of papal inquisitors after 1233.\nKonrad chose several fanatical collaborators to assist him, including Conrad Dorso and John the One-Eyed. Their activities quickly aroused fear. According to contemporary accounts, they gave the accused no opportunity for defense. Those who confessed to heresy received absolution, and as a penance, their heads were shaved as a mark of shame. Those who maintained their innocence were sentenced to the stake without proper verification of the charges. Konrad himself and his assistants were aware of the arbitrariness of their methods and the risk of error, but they reportedly claimed that they would burn a hundred innocents if there was even one guilty among them. In these conditions, inquisitorial activity also elicited protests from Catholics, including clergy. Archbishop Siegfried III von Eppstein of Mainz finally admonished Konrad, urging moderation. However, Konrad ignored these appeals. He was confident in the support of Pope Gregory IX, to whom he reported on the existence of a sect of Lucifer worshippers in Germany. Based on these reports, the pope issued the papal bull Vox in Rama in June 1233, repeating in it the fantastic accusations made by Konrad against German heretics. Konrad's and his collaborators' position remained unshaken until Konrad accused Count of Sayn of heresy. The count appealed to the Archbishop of Mainz, and Konrad was forced to submit to his authority. At the synod on 25 July 1233, the count was cleared of charges, despite the protests of the inquisitor. Five days later, Konrad was murdered, and shortly thereafter, Conrad Dorso and John the One-Eyed met a similar fate. The synod in Frankfurt in 1234 rehabilitated about 50 people convicted by Konrad von Marburg.\nIn 1231 and 1232, Pope Gregory IX issued identical papal bulls titled Ille humani generis to the Dominicans from the convents in Regensburg (22 November 1231), Friesach (27 November 1231), Würzburg (2 March 1232), and Strasbourg (2 December 1232), entrusting them with anti-heretical tasks. However, most likely, the scope of these tasks was limited to pastoral activities and supporting the activities of the episcopal courts, rather than encompassing inquisitorial powers in the strict sense of the word.\n\n\n== From 1233 to 1348 ==\n\nThe Synod in Frankfurt in 1234 indeed marked the end of the existence of the papal inquisition in Germany for over a hundred years. The combating of heresy during this period was in the hands of the bishops, but there are no traces of any significant anti-heretical actions until the end of the 13th century. It is only known that around 1266, an investigation against the Waldensians was conducted in the diocese of Passau, and the testimonies obtained were used by one of the anonymous investigators to provide a detailed description of their doctrine, although the detailed course and results of this investigation remain unknown.\nOnly at the beginning of the 14th century did German bishops undertake a more vigorous action against heretics. From 1311 to 1315 and again around 1338, numerous trials and executions of Waldensians took place in Austria. In 1336, the same sect was discovered in Brandenburg. Slightly earlier in Germany, hunts for alleged adherents of the so-called Brethren of the Free Spirit began, condemned by the decree of the Council of Vienne, Ad nostrum. Most likely, there never existed any unified brotherhood or association professing such heresy; rather, the term referred simply to a certain group of unorthodox views attributed mainly to members of secular religious associations of uncertain canonical status (such as Beguines and Beghards) and various religious eccentrics. The first persecution of the Brethren of the Free Spirit sect took place in Strasbourg from 1317 to 1319 under the leadership of the local bishop, John Dirpheim. Trials also took place in other locations, including Cologne (1326), Metz (1335), Magdeburg (1336), Constance (1339), Salzburg (1340), and Würzburg (1342).\nAll the aforementioned persecutions were the work of episcopal courts. For over a hundred years after 1233, not a single case of appointing a papal inquisitor in Germany is known, even though Poland and Bohemia further east had papal inquisitors as early as 1318, and Hungary from 1327. Perhaps an explanation for this could be the fact that Emperor Louis IV (died 1347) pursued a policy hostile to the papacy and for a time even supported the Antipope Nicholas V (1328–1330). It was only after Charles IV ascended to the throne in 1348 that relations between the papacy and the empire warmed. In the same year, a tribunal of the papal inquisition was established in Germany.\n\n\n== From 1348 to the 16th century ==\n\n\n=== Papal Inquisition ===\n\nIn 1348, Pope Clement VI appointed Dominican friar Johann Schadland from the Strasbourg convent as the inquisitor for Germany. His nomination was confirmed by Pope Innocent VI in 1353, with a specific mandate to combat doctrinal errors spreading among the Beghards communities. However, it's hard to gauge how seriously the papacy regarded the threat of heresy, given that Schadland was appointed as the sole inquisitor for the entire Germany. Despite his determination in raising funds for organizing the tribunal, there are very few records of his actual anti-heretical activity. He did not receive financial or organizational support from the German episcopal conference or secular authorities. Eventually, in 1359, Pope Innocent VI appointed him as the Bishop of Chełmno, without naming a successor to the inquisitorial position.\nThe true architect of the papal inquisition in Germany was Pope Urban V, who in 1364 appointed four Dominican inquisitors: Walter Kerlinger for Saxony, Heinrich Agro for the Archdiocese of Mainz, Ludwig de Caliga for the Archdioceses of Cologne and Trier, and John de Moneta for the Archdiocese of Salzburg. Similar to Schadland, their task was to combat the Brethren of the Free Spirit, mainly among the Beghards and Beguines. Walter Kerlinger, in particular, demonstrated great zeal in his role. From 1367 to 1369 in Erfurt, he punished over 200 Beghards and Beguines, expelled an equal number from the city, and led trials in other locations as well. His actions received significant support from Emperor Charles IV, who issued several edicts in 1369 supporting the inquisition.\n\nIn 1372, Pope Gregory XI authorized the provincial prior of the Dominican province of Teutonia (southern and western Germany) to appoint inquisitors (up to five) throughout Germany, including areas under the province of Saxony (northern and eastern Germany and Livonia). This decision marked the culmination of the formation of permanent structures of the papal inquisition in Germany.\nDespite the emperor's support, the activities of the inquisitors against the Beghards and Beguines faced numerous protests from clergy and laity who believed the accusations against these communities were unjust. In response to these protests, Pope Gregory XI issued papal bulls in 1374 and 1377, recommending great caution in trials against members of these associations, emphasizing that most of them were good and devout Catholics, with only a few falling into doctrinal errors. These bulls coincided almost perfectly with the death of Walter Kerlinger (1373), leading to a significant decline in papal inquisition activities for several years.\nThe papal inquisition's activities saw a resurgence during the pontificate of Pope Boniface IX (1389–1404). Once again, there were trials of alleged supporters of the Brethren of the Free Spirit in Austria, Cologne, and Mecklenburg. The inquisitor of Saxony, Eylard Schöneveld, showed particular activity, burning four individuals in several Baltic cities from 1402 to 1403. However, in the persecution of the Waldensians in eastern and southern Germany during Boniface IX's reign, papal inquisitors hardly participated, except for the trials in Mainz in 1389 and Strasbourg in 1400.\nIn 1399, Boniface IX reorganized the papal inquisition office in Germany, authorizing each Dominican provincial from Saxony to appoint up to six inquisitors in their province, whereas until then, only the provincial of Teutonia had the right to nominate, and that no more than five throughout Germany. Nonetheless, in 1409, the Teutonia provincial still appointed an inquisitor in the Saxony province, citing Gregory XI's bull from 1372. The earliest traces of such authorization by the Saxony provincial date back to the second half of the 15th century.\nIn 1414, inquisitor Heinrich Schöneveld presided over the trials of 84 members of the millenarian sect of flagellants in Sangerhausen, Thuringia. He sentenced three individuals to death, while others received penitential measures as they renounced heresy. After the departure of the inquisitor, local authorities disregarded his judgments, burning all heretics at the stake and organizing a hunt for their supporters in the area. In total, at least 168 individuals (perhaps even around 300) were burned at the stake by secular courts that year in Thuringia.\nThe Council of Constance, held between 1414 and 1418, defended the communities of Beguines and Beghards, definitively putting an end to their persecutions. Trials against alleged followers of the Brethren of the Free Spirit sporadically occurred until 1458, but they only concerned individual religious eccentrics, not larger groups or communities.\nA much more significant decision made by the Council of Constance was the condemnation of Hussitism. During its sessions, two leaders of this movement, Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague, were burned at the stake. Throughout the 15th century, many missionaries from Bohemia attempted to spread Hussite views in Germany. Additionally, in the east, after the period of persecution from 1389 to 1404, Waldensian communities re-emerged, which, in fact, established friendly relations with the Czech Hussites. Paradoxically, however, papal inquisitors hardly participated in combating Hussites and Waldensians. The only significant anti-heretical actions by the papal inquisition after the Council of Constance were the trials of flagellants in Nordhausen in 1434 and 1446, as well as in Thuringia in 1454. Furthermore, in 1425, for several years, the inquisitorial office in the Archbishopric of Mainz was taken away from the Dominicans for reasons unknown, and Pope Martin V appointed John Lagenator, a professor at the Heidelberg University, as inquisitor.\n\nIn the second half of the 15th century, the activity of the papal inquisition in Germany almost completely ceased. Although the authorities of the Dominican Order regularly made appointments, and the number of inquisitors even increased compared to the previous period, most of them treated the inquisitorial office solely as an honorary distinction and did not engage in any anti-heretical activities. Almost all German inquisitors of this period were simultaneously priors of convents, vicars of the order's \"nations\", university professors, and even provincial superiors of the order, often combining several such functions. Some, such as Gerhard von Elten and Jacob Sprenger, were involved in the internal reform of the Dominican Order. The two most famous of the few heresy trials conducted by papal inquisitors in the last 50 years before Martin Luther's emergence, namely the trial of John Rucherat in 1479 (inquisitor Gerhard von Elten) and the trial of Johann Reuchlin in 1513 (inquisitor Jacob van Hoogstraaten), were instances of university professors exploiting the inquisitorial office to settle scores with opponents in the academic-scientific environment. These trials, especially the trial of Reuchlin, significantly diminished the prestige of the papal inquisition in Germany.\nAn exception in terms of inquisitorial zeal was Heinrich Kramer, appointed in 1479 as an inquisitor in the Upper German district. He was a staunch advocate of the theory of the reality and universality of witchcraft crimes and attempted to unleash witch-hunts first in the Diocese of Constance (from 1481 to 1484) and then in the Tyrolean Diocese of Brixen (1485). However, these initiatives did not receive the expected support from local authorities. Kramer, who had previously distinguished himself in polemics with conciliarists, defending the authority of the Apostolic See, managed to obtain the support of Pope Innocent VIII (papal bull Summis desiderantes affectibus of 5 December 1484), and in 1486/1487, he wrote and published the book Malleus Maleficarum, a handbook for witch hunters. Kramer's activities were an exception, and he soon came into conflict with the religious authorities, who condemned him in 1490 for various offenses.\nIn 1515, in the north-western part of the Empire, a new Dominican provincial territory, Lower Germany (Germania Inferioris), was established, which later, by 1525, became a separate unit in the territorial structures of the papal inquisition. In 1542, the provincial of Lower Germany received from the Pope the right to appoint inquisitors in several Dutch dioceses.\nMartin Luther's appearance in 1517 occurred at a time when the papal inquisition had, for over half a century, essentially not been prosecuting heretics, and its prestige in the German lands, in connection with the trial of the humanist Johannes Reuchlin, was close to zero. The publication of the pamphlet Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum in 1516 mocked inquisitors as backward individuals, contrasting them with \"modern\" humanists, including Reuchlin. Also, the activities of the indulgence preacher Johann Tetzel, who was an inquisitor in Poland, weakened the prestige and position of this institution. These circumstances, as well as the lack of sufficient organizational support, meant that the German inquisition was unable to react to Luther's appearance.\n\n\n=== Episcopal Inquisition ===\n\nThe establishment of the papal inquisition did not weaken the anti-heretical activities of German bishops and their delegated diocesan inquisitors. In 1350, the inquisitors of the Archbishop of Magdeburg sentenced the Beghard Konstantin to death. In the 1360s, the inquisitor Henry of Olomouc conducted many trials against Austrian Waldensians in the Passau diocese, and in 1378/1379, persecutions of Waldensians also took place in Nuremberg (Bamberg diocese). In 1374, at the initiative of the Bishop of Strasbourg, Lambert, an investigation was conducted against Beguines, which also affected Franciscan and Dominican third order.\nIn the 1380s, large-scale persecutions of Waldensians began in eastern and southern Germany, reaching their peak in the next decade. They were mainly the work of two itinerant inquisitors: Peter Zwicker of the Celestine Order and Priest Martin of Amberg from the Prague diocese. Martin began his career in Regensburg in 1381 as an inquisitor delegated by the Archbishop of Prague, Jan, who served as papal legate in this region. He then conducted trials against Waldensians in Würzburg, Erfurt, Bamberg, Bohemia, and on the Austro-Hungarian border (until 1401). Peter Zwicker initially collaborated with Martin in Erfurt in 1391, then conducted investigations in Pomerania (from 1392 to 1394), Austria (from 1391 to 1403, intermittently), and Hungary (1400/1401). These investigations covered several thousand suspects, who were generally treated fairly leniently, although in Erfurt in 1391 and in Steyr, Austria, in 1397, many Waldensians were burned at the stake. These inquisitors, although operating in many dioceses, never had papal mandate for their actions. Probably, the catalyst for this campaign was the fairly numerous conversions among Waldensian leaders in the 1380s. Obtaining information from them about the faithful in many regions, Peter Zwicker and Martin of Amberg moved from diocese to diocese, each time seeking authorization from the local bishop, but in fact, these persecutions were their grassroots initiative. Under their influence, Archbishop of Mainz, Conrad von Weinsberg, also ordered investigations in his diocese (process in Bingen in 1392), as did Bishop Friedrich von Öttingen of Eichstätt (1395), and in the Augsburg diocese, Heinrich Angermeier undertook inquisitorial activity on his own initiative (though with the approval of the local bishop) from 1393 to 1394.\nSimilarly to the Waldensians, the efforts to counter the influence of Hussitism in Germany after the Council of Constance were almost exclusively undertaken by episcopal courts. In the 1420s, in Regensburg, Magdeburg, Wurzburg, and Speyer, several Hussite missionaries were captured and burned, but generally, this movement did not gain broader support in Germany. On the other hand, German Waldensian communities established friendly contacts with Czech Hussites, as evidenced by the proceedings conducted by the bishops' inquisitors in Würzburg (1446), Brandenburg (1458 and 1478/1480), Strasbourg (1458), Eichstätt (1460), the Naumburg diocese (1462), and Vienna (1468). In 1481, in the Halberstadt diocese, there was also probably the last flagellant trial in history.\n\n\n== Reformation ==\n\nInitiated by Martin Luther in 1517, the Reformation marked the effective end of the inquisition's activities in German lands. Many of them (including the Electorates of Saxony, the Palatinate, and Brandenburg, the Duchies of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, Hesse, etc.) embraced Protestantism, secularized church property, and dissolved monasteries, including the Dominican Order upon which the inquisition was based. Conversely, in Catholic countries (Austria, Bavaria), repression against heretics by the late 1520s shifted to secular courts, replacing the weak and inefficient ecclesiastical judiciary. Dominican inquisitors were regularly appointed for the three Rhenish metropolises (residing in Cologne) but these appointments were also discontinued in the second half of the 16th century.\nIn the Netherlands (Germania Inferioris), the monastic authorities appointed titular inquisitors until the end of the 16th century, with the last two dying in 1608. However, after Emperor Charles V established the state-church Dutch Inquisition between 1522 and 1525, they played no role in combating heresy.\nThe actual abolition of the inquisition in Germany in the first half of the 16th century by no means ushered in religious tolerance. The transfer of heresy cases to secular courts initially led to a significant increase in the intensity and brutality of persecutions of heretics in some German territories, on a scale unknown in previous centuries. Although the repression utterly failed against the major currents of the Reformation, which gained the support of many princes and cities, many members of the radical Anabaptist sect fell victim to persecution. Emperor Charles V Habsburg ordered them to be punished with death as rebels, regardless of their eventual repentance. From 1527 to 1618, secular courts in Germany sentenced approximately 850 Anabaptists to death, with nearly 80% being burned in Austria and Tyrol between 1527 and 1533. A small portion of these executions took place in regions that embraced the Reformation. These repressions gradually waned after the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. However, even then, Germany did not become a country without stakes. Starting around 1560, Germany became the main area for witch-hunts for nearly two hundred years, claiming at least 20,000 victims, far more than the persecutions of heretics in this country by the inquisition, episcopal courts, and secular courts combined over the previous five hundred years. However, the papal inquisition had no involvement in this, and in the 17th century, the Roman Holy Office even intervened to mitigate these processes in Catholic German countries and Switzerland.\n\n\n== Statistics of trials and executions ==\n\n\n=== Trials of the papal inquisition ===\n\nThe number of judgments by the papal inquisition in Germany, as in other regions, is difficult to ascertain due to the insufficient number of sources. Information about the activity of the first inquisitor, Konrad von Marburg, is almost exclusively vague, mentioning a \"great number burned\", and that many falsely confessed to avoid the death penalty. Those who confessed were spared their lives, but their heads were shaved as a sign of shame. The only specific numerical data refers to four heretics burned in Erfurt in May 1232 and about 50 individuals absolved and rehabilitated by the synod in Frankfurt in 1234, who had previously been sentenced by Konrad. One chronicle suggests that he burned around a thousand accused, but this number cannot be verified and is likely exaggerated.\nThere is no information suggesting that Inquisitor Johann Schadland ever participated in processes against heretics. However, it is probable that the re-trial of the Beghard Bertold von Rohrbach in 1356, resulting in his burning at the stake, was conducted by him or possibly his vicar.\nRegarding the inquisitors appointed in 1364, more information is available only about the activities of Walter Kerlinger. In the trials against the Beguines and Beghards in Erfurt from 1367 to 1369, he burned three individuals, imposed penances on over two hundred, and around another two hundred fled the city. In 1369, he arrested 40 Beguines and Beghards in Nordhausen, of whom 7 were sentenced to death. Henry Agro is only known to have burned the Beguine Meta von Westhove in Strasbourg in 1366. Likewise, Ludwig Caliga excommunicated one heretical priest in Soest and may have acted against Beguines and Beghards in Cologne, but no further details are known.\nInquisitor Johannes Arnoldi presided over the trial of 18 Waldensians in Mainz in 1389, who renounced heresy and accepted the penance imposed by him. He previously participated in the trials against Hartmann der Birman in Strasbourg (1384) and Jan Müsinger in Ulm (1385), who also renounced heresy. His successor, Nikolaus Böckeler, in 1391 conducted a trial against Jan Malkaw in Strasbourg, who was ultimately sentenced to exile; the trial had a political character, its real reason being that Malkaw supported Pope Boniface IX, while the inquisitor supported Antipope Clement VII. In 1400, the same inquisitor arrested 32 Waldensians and one Beguine in Strasbourg; one Waldensian was burned, while the remaining accused received penitential sentences or were expelled from the city. Perhaps the executions of Beguines and Beghards in Heidelberg around 1393, known only through a chance mention in the records of another trial, were also carried out by Böckeler.\nIn 1393, Inquisitor Alexander of Cologne burned one Beghard, and three years later in Vienna, John Stauder sentenced three of his associates to death, including the sect leader Nicholas of Basel, although one managed to escape. Similarly, in Rostock in 1394, Helike Pors was burned for heresy; the verdict was most likely issued by Inquisitor Dietrich Kolle. Inquisitor Eylard Schöneveld burned four individuals in various Baltic cities from 1402 to 1403. His relative Heinrich Schöneveld burned a Waldensian, Jakob Schröder, in Brandenburg in 1411, and in 1414, he burned three out of 84 individuals tried for belonging to the Flagellant sect in Sangerhausen, imposing penances on the others. However, after his departure, local authorities organized massacres of the suspects both in Sangerhausen and the surrounding area, burning both those sentenced to death and penitents on the stakes (in total, at least 168 individuals).\nJakob von Soest presided over the trial of priest John Palborne in 1421, who was accused of heresy for criticizing the privileges of mendicant orders. The case nearly reached the papal curia, but Palborne was ultimately treated leniently. Inquisitor John of Frankfurt, from the Metropolis of Mainz, sentenced the Hussite Jan Fuyger to death in Würzburg in 1429. Inquisitor Heinrich Kalteisen burned one Beghard in Mainz in 1458 and earlier, around 1435, condemned one woman in absentia as an adept of black magic.\nIn 1434 and again in 1446, trials against Flagellants were held in Nordhausen. In the first trial, Inquisitor Konrad von Westhausen did not sentence anyone to death, while in the second trial, Inquisitor Friedrich Müller burned 12 out of 13 accused. The same inquisitor burned two heretics in Göttingen in 1453, after a prior public debate with them, and a year later, he participated in trials of Flagellants in Stolberg and probably in Sangerhausen as well, where a total of 52 individuals were burned. However, scant sources suggest that these persecutions were mainly inspired by secular authorities.\nIn 1479, Inquisitor Gerhard von Elten of Cologne presided over the trial of Jan Rucherat, who was sentenced to imprisonment. In 1477, Inquisitor Johannes Krawinckel of Dortmund accused someone named Hovet of heresy, but the trial did not proceed because Bishop Heinrich von Schwarzenburg of Münster refused to cooperate with him. Several years later, the vicar of this inquisitor sentenced an alleged witch to the stake in Osnabrück.\nInquisitor Heinrich Kramer, who became famous as a witch hunter and author of the Malleus Maleficarum, claimed that between 1481 and 1486 he burned 48 witches mainly in the diocese of Konstanz, and in 1491 he stated that he judged over 200 witches. Preserved documentation confirms a trial in Ravensburg in 1484, where Kramer accused eight people of witchcraft, two of whom were burned, and proceedings in Innsbruck in 1485. There, Kramer arrested seven women, but due to the intervention of the Bishop of Brixen, no convicting verdict was issued. Slightly earlier, in 1480 in Augsburg, Kramer accused a local canon and a \"beguine\" of heresy, but failed to prove their guilt.\nJakob van Hoogstraten, the inquisitor of Cologne, in 1512 sentenced the heretic Hermann von Rysswick to the stake, a \"repeat offender\", whom the inquisitor of Utrecht, Jan van Ommaten, absolved in 1502. However, the most famous trial involving this inquisitor was the trial of the renowned humanist and Hebraist Johannes Reuchlin, conducted in 1513. As a result of an appeal to Rome, Reuchlin was acquitted, which was a severe blow to Hoogstraten, but the inquisitor managed to have the trial reopened. Ultimately, the entire affair ended with the condemnation of Reuchlin's works by Pope Leo X in 1520, but the only punishment for the author was a gag order and the obligation to pay the trial costs; formally, he was not recognized as a heretic. The same inquisitor in 1525 burned Willem Dirksz in Utrecht, a supporter of Martin Luther.\nThe inquisitor of Cologne, Konrad Köllin, sentenced to death at least five people accused of supporting the Reformation (two in 1529 and three in 1533).\nThe following list contains documented executions of heretics in Germany from the judgments of papal inquisitors:\n\n\n=== Trials of the episcopal inquisition ===\n\nBishop courts in Germany issued significantly more verdicts in cases of heresy than papal inquisitors, but even in their case, the preserved data is fragmentary and not always precise.\nThe proceedings conducted by Bishop Heinrich of Strasbourg in 1212 encompassed around 500 suspects. Four hundred of them voluntarily renounced heresy, while the remaining hundred denied the charges and were subjected to trials by ordeal. Eighty of them failed the trial, prompting the bishop to order their burning at the stake. Over the next twenty years, stakes with heretics also ignited in Hildesheim (1225, one executed), again in Strasbourg (1229, one burned), and in Trier (1231, three burned). However, nothing is known about the results of proceedings against Waldensians in the Passau diocese around 1266.\nDuring the persecution of Waldensians in Austria from 1311 to 1315 by the bishop of Passau, at least 39 people were burned, including a heretical bishop. Unfortunately, the chronicles do not provide the number of penitents who received milder punishments. Even less information has survived about the subsequent wave of repression against Waldensians around 1338. The chronicles only mention that \"many\" heretics were burned, while others submitted to the Church.\nIn the investigation against Beghards and Beguines in Strasbourg from 1317 to 1319, a large but unspecified number of suspects were punished, with exile likely being the harshest penalty. In 1326, Archbishop Heinrich von Virneburg of Cologne arrested about 50 \"Beghards\" whom he accused of professing the Brethren of the Free Spirit heresy. Most of them submitted to the Church, renounced heresy, and received penitential sentences. Out of the nine who stubbornly defended their beliefs, eight were sentenced to \"perpetual imprisonment\", and the sect leader, Walter Lollard, was burned at the stake. In 1336, in Angermünde in the Brandenburg diocese, 14 Waldensians were burned based on the judgment of the bishop's inquisitor Jordan of Quedlinburg. In the same year, an investigation against adherents of the Brethren of the Free Spirit heresy was conducted by Archbishop Otto of Magdeburg, but in this case, all suspects submitted to the Church. In 1339, the bishop of Constance sentenced three Beghards to prison, and three years later, a similar sentence was imposed on two Beghards by the bishop of Würzburg. In 1340, Father Rudolf was burned in Salzburg, and ten years later, in Erfurt, the vicar of the Archbishop of Mainz burned \"Beghard\" Konstantin. Slightly earlier, in 1334, an unknown number of heretics were burned in Metz based on the judgments of the bishop's inquisitor Waryn.\nIn Nuremberg (Bamberg diocese) during the 14th century, there were regular trials of Waldensians. In 1332, 90 members of this sect were expelled from the city. In 1378, one Waldensian was burned, and 93 received penitential sentences. The following year, another trial resulted in the burning of 7 individuals, 11 were ordered to wear penitential crosses, and 19 fled the city and were condemned in absentia. Seven more Waldensians were burned on the orders of Bishop's inquisitor Martin of Amberg in 1399, who also reconciled with the Church an unspecified number of Nuremberg heretics.\nData regarding the great campaign against Waldensians at the end of the 14th century is incomplete, but it indicates it was the largest anti-heretical campaign in German history. In Pomerania from 1392 to 1394, Peter Zwicker judged a total of 443 suspects, all of whom renounced heresy and accepted penances imposed by the inquisitor. Investigations initiated by the Archbishop of Mainz in Bingen led to 36 executions in 1392. In the Augsburg diocese in 1393, inquisitor Heinrich Angermeier judged around 280 Waldensians, sentencing two to death in Dinkelsbühl and twenty-six in Donauwörth. In Wemding (Eichstätt diocese) the same year, Bishop's inquisitor Bertold burned ten individuals. Investigations in the late 1390s in Thuringia and Bohemia, as well as in Austria and Hungary, resulted in approximately two thousand \"reconciliations\" of Waldensians with the Catholic Church. Additionally, in 1397 in Steyr, Peter Zwicker burned about a hundred Waldensians, and an unknown number of executions also occurred in 1391 in Erfurt.\nRecords from the 1390s refer to earlier proceedings conducted by Henry of Olomouc against Waldensians in Austria in the 1360s and by Martin of Amberg in the Regensburg diocese from 1381 to 1387. These mentions do not speak of executions but only of cases where individuals renounced heresy when confronted again by inquisitors.\nIn the second and third decades of the 15th century, in several German cities, bishop's inquisitors apprehended and sentenced several Hussite missionaries. In 1416, a radical preacher, Nicholas of Dresden, was burned in Meissen. In 1420, subdeacon Jakob Kremer of Verden was burned in Magdeburg. The same year in Regensburg, Henry Grünfeld was burned, and three years later in the same city, Bishop sentenced preacher Henry Rathgeber to death. In 1424 in Worms, three Hussites were captured, of whom one (Jan Drändorf) was burned, the second denied his beliefs and received absolution (Martin Borchard), and the third (Peter Turnau) escaped from prison. However, he was later captured in Speyer in 1426 and burned by the local bishop's court. Presumably, imprecise references to heretic trials in the Constance diocese in the 1430s involve Hussites; at least two itinerant preachers were burned there along with their supporters.\nIn 1446, the Bishop of Würzburg reconciled as many as 130 Waldensians with the Church. Similar success was achieved by the proceedings led by the Bishop of Eichstätt, who absolved 27 Waldensians in 1460. In Strasbourg in 1458, Hussite preacher Henry Reiser and his associate Anna Weiler were burned, but the rest of his followers renounced heresy. In Brandenburg in 1458, three Hussite clergy were captured, two of whom renounced heresy, and one (Matthew Hagen) was burned in Berlin. The investigation was conducted by Bishop's inquisitor Jan Canneman, who then interrogated residents of Angermünde suspected of heresy. As all of them submitted to the Church, no death sentences were issued there. From 1478 to 1480, there were again trials in this region, resulting in the burning of eleven Hussites. Additionally, in 1468 in Vienna, Hussite Bishop Stephen of Basel was burned.\nThe fate of the flagellants, captured in 1481 by Count of Anhalt and handed over to the court of the Bishop of Halberstadt, is unknown.\n\n\n=== Executions of heretics by verdicts of council courts ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDecker, Rainer (2010).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "A plant micro-reserve (abbr. PMR) is a type of small nature preserve that targets rare or threatened plant species, protecting the species' main populations from further decline. They also serve as hotspots for biodiversity monitoring, seed collection, and plant management. A micro-reserve centers around a single habitat or plant habitat, and is usually smaller than 20 hectares. A PMR may be located on public or private land, and is obtained by a governmental agency by a voluntary turnover of the area. They are managed by national, regional, or local governments, or by individuals, families, or non-governmental organizations. First piloted in the Spanish province of Valencia in 1990, the concept was subsequently funded by the European LIFE programme. It has since spread across Europe, including large networks in Bulgaria, Latvia, Cyprus, and Greece.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nWhile the precise definition of a plant micro-reserve may vary based on which country it has been established in, a 2014 planning document described them as \"protected natural plots to ensure the biological monitoring and conservation management\". PMRs can be centered on many different kinds of locations and habitats. Each of these habitats can be considered as a \"biogeographic island\", with unique evolutionary pressures that force adaptations and lead to increased biodiversity. Smaller sites may be characterized by a spring, small islet, or coastal cliffside. Larger sites might have such pressures as skeletal or saline soil, or rocky scree.\n\nThere is also no exact requirement for the size of a plant micro-reserve. In Crete and Spain, they are considered to be reserves with an area of less than 20 hectares, while elsewhere in the Mediterranean the upper limit is 100 hectares. However, they have the shared characteristic of intensively protecting one or several highly threatened plant species, usually endemics. PMRs are organized based on \"singularity\", or the individual site, and \"complementarity\", or their ability to contribute to a larger patchwork of conservational areas. In an ideal scenario, a plant micro-reserve should consist of the core protection area, where the defining habitat feature is located, and be surrounded by a buffer area to reduce the impact of external threats. However, some PMRs that are surrounded by a large amount of human developments, buffer zones may be impossible to establish. In either place, boundaries should be clearly defined by landmarking and signposts. These may consist of informational signs directed at visitors or tourists, indicative signals to warn against unintentional damage to the protected area, or perimetric signals to demarcate the exact border of the reserve.\nIn some cases, governments may have the authority to seize and conserve land; however, the area of a plant micro-reserve must be obtained voluntarily. Private or public entities can turn over land to be managed as a PMR, but this agreement is permanent and not revokable. Boundaries are sometimes defined geographically, and other times by the plant population of the PMR. As such, the area of some PMRs could shift based on the protected population. The private PMRs are run by either individual families or landowners, or by conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Public reserves are owned by either city councils, provincial governments, or national governments.\nInside a micro-reserve, certain actions that would damage the protected plants are forbidden. In all PMRs, no human action can be taken that would impact the protected plants themselves or the soil substrate they live on. The exception to this rule is that livestock ranching may be allowed for plants that rely on grazing to reproduce. Each micro-reserve may also have additional prohibitions on a case-to-case basis, such as restrictions on hiking or climbing. Certain activity is allowed in PMRs that might be forbidden in other types of nature preserves, such as hunting animals and gathering invertebrates. These human activities are sometimes even encouraged, especially when they contribute to the maintenance of the current state of the PMR. Additionally, PMRs are rarely fenced or otherwise cut off from surrounding areas by physical barriers.\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\n\nThe general purpose of a plant micro reserve is to provide a protected area for the conservation of rare plants that can only thrive in a very limited niche or habitat. PMRs must be actively managed; conservation areas that only have \"passive or preventative protection\" should not be considered PMRs. They help preserve the type localities of plant species, and protect against uncontrolled urban sprawl by restricting changes to land use. Seeds collected from PMRs can be used to reintroduce plants to localities where they were previously extinct, as was the case with Medicago arborea subsp. citrina and Silene hifacensis.\nPMRs can also be used to educate the public on conservation. They change public perceptions on land that was previously considered \"unproductive\", increase locals' knowledge of their endemic plant species, and tie plants to that community's identity. Micro-reserves can also maintain wild populations of useful cultivated plants for ethnobotanical study and use. Furthermore, they lower the barrier for entry for small NGOs or villages to participate in conservation efforts, and shorter path to conservation without a lengthy bureaucratic process by requiring a simple contract of only one or two pages for establishment.\nIn nature reserves, focus is usually on protecting animal species; PMRs make up for that by focusing on plant species. Another focus of traditional reserves that has unintended consequences is their goal of preserving climax communities at the end stages of an ecosystem's development, particularly old-growth forests. This often means that endemic pioneering plants or species that require direct sunlight are inadvertently harmed by conservation efforts. Because biomass management such as grazing or firewood collection can be allowed in PMRs, those methods may be used to protect and maintain the surviving habitats for those types of shrubs and grasses.\n\n\n=== Shortcomings ===\nThere are a variety of shortcomings that restrict the effectiveness of plant micro-reserves. The inconsistency of their definition, lack of consideration for past and future evolutionary developments, and their fragmented and dispersed nature are obstacles to successful conservation. Specifically, the wide range of scale in conservation efforts in Europe, from Nature Monuments of just a few square meters to National Parks of massive size, mean that PMRs have to compete and fit into a chaotic patchwork of regulations. Other issues include the low representation of non-endemic species, and those that are not immediately critically endangered, in PMRs. Additionally, some of the most rare species are only found on private land, which the government cannot forcefully turn into a PMR if the owner does not want the land to be preserved.\nMany coastal PMRs have been heavily eroded because of new breakwater construction in nearby areas. Previously strong populations of threatened endemics like Limonium rigualii and Silene cambessedesii have been reduced or destroyed by coastal erosion of PMRs. Because authorities that manage PMRs have no jurisdiction outside of the protected reserve, they cannot contest or undo the development of external structures that impact the plants inside the PMR.\n\n\n== Project histories ==\nThe modern concept of a protected area of small dimensions was originally described in 1981, with a proposal for mini-reserves to legally demarcate \"enclaves\" of endemic flora. The model location for the proposal was a Spanish site called \"La Encantada\" in Villarrobledo, Albacete. The concept was expanded upon over the following decade, and the first plant micro-reserve was fully established in 1990 in Valencia. The concept was officially recognized by the European Union in 1994, and started to be funded by its LIFE programme. Good candidate for small-scale conservation because of its high number of rare endemic species, mountainous terrain that creates many distinct micro-habitats, and the presence of isolated relict species throughout the province. Wide array of climates and elevation. Protect the entire population of several species found nowhere else in the world, such as Limonium perplexum. By 2001, more than 150 locations had been identified and began the process of recognition, of which 14 were already officially declared plant micro-reserves. The concept later spread to other regions of Spain, such as Castilla La Mancha. There, the plant micro-reserves primarily focused on more aquatic habitats such as bogs, ponds, and salt lagoons. Some PMRs there also target inland dunes and gypsum steppes.\nThe precursor to PMRs in Latvia were called Woodland Key Habitats (WKHs). Characterized by high concentrations of rare species that require specific types of forested environments to thrive, there was no official protection for WKHs under Latvian law. The micro-reserve concept was first introduced in the country in 2001, under a slightly different framework than the Valencian PMRs. The first reserve targeted a part of the habitat of the middle spotted woodpecker, while subsequent reserves have been created by a patchwork of independent organizations. However, by 2012 there were more than two thousand reserves covering nearly forty-thousand hectares. Most of these are not specifically for plants, but to protect various bird species. Around 12% of the reserves are PMRs for forests, other vascular plants, or bryophytes. Until 2011, financial compensation was given to landowners that turned over their property for nature preservation, but due to budget constraints the program was stopped.\nIn 2010, a new project to establish several PMRs on Cyprus began. When the project was completed three years later, five micro-reserves had been established. They protected four plant species (Ophrys kotschyi, Arabis kennedyae, Centaurea akamantis, and Astragalus macrocarpus subsp. lefkarensis) and two critical habitats (scrub and low vegetation of Quercus alnifolia and Cedrus brevifolia forests). Management of the Cypriot PMRs included new efforts, such as removing flammable biomass, rerouting human paths through the reserves to be less destructive, and culling competitive species that encroached on threatened plants. The project also resulted in the planting of more than 200 additional seedlings for most of the targeted species. Additionally, seeds were distributed to a Cypriot botanical garden and the national seed bank of Cyprus.\n\nAn extensive pilot project to expand the PMR concept to the island of Crete was undertaken, and by 2013 there were seven reserves established, all on public land. Each of the seven reserves targeted a different species of importance to the European Community: Androcymbium rechingeri, Anthemis glaberrima, Bupleurum kakiskalae, Cephalanthera cucullata, Hypericum aciferum, Nepeta sphaciotica, and Phoenix palm groves. The pilot includes limited monitoring and management involvement, such as recording meteorological data, plant caging, artificial pollination, and the hiring of wardens from local villages to protect the PMRs. The Cretan flora were clearly divided in two categories: those that faced many threats but still had large populations, and those with small populations that faced extinction. One of the project's focuses was combating over-grazing and reversing genetic erosion caused by unsustainably small plant populations.\nIn Bulgaria, an initial project for the implementation of the PMR concept took place from 2010 to 2014, and saw the creation of 58 small protected areas following the model of the Valencian plant micro-networks. Bulgarian PMRs can be established either around a habitat of an endangered species, or around a \"remarkable landscape\" irrespective of the plant species located there. The Bulgarian project included 44 vascular plants, as well as three bryophyte species: Mannia androgyna, Riccia crustata, and Trichocolea tomentella.\nSeveral other smaller projects have also been undertaken. In Slovenia, a small network of micro-reserves was established in the Karst Edge area, which consists of rocky limestone slopes and dry grasslands. The project, which was completed in 2005, specifically targeted the plant species Moehringia tommasiniana as well as several butterflies and amphibians. Five PMRs were planned to be established on the Sinai peninsula, but were stalled following the political upheaval of the Arab Spring in 2011.\n\n\n== Proposals and future development ==\nSeveral proposals have been made for the expansion of the plant micro-reserve concept. Because Sicily has no regulations that protect wild plants, a 2013 proposal called for a PMR to protect a population of Silene hicesiae on Panarea island. The reserve would be \"intensely managed\" because the small population of the species is threatened by a variety of pressures. Also in 2013, seven PMR sites were proposed in the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira out of 148 surveyed locations. They specifically focused on protecting sites from new buildings, trash accumulation, and invasive species competition. In response to Chinese plans to protect Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESPs) in that country, a proposal was made in 2017 to adopt the PMR model in order to describe new species and protect against rapid urbanization. In 2021, a proposal was made to protect Acis nicaeensis in Monaco and Nice from urban sprawl. The region was claimed to be highly suitable to the PMR concept because of the mountainous terrain that leads to many disjointed plant populations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBancheva, Svetlana; Velev, Nikolay; Vladimirov, Vladimir; Valyovska, Natalia (2014).

        "content": "The Afghan Commando Forces were the former combined commando, paratrooper and special formations of the Afghan Armed Forces, composed of numerous brigades, regiments and battalions established by King Mohammad Zahir Shah in 1964 and disbanded in 1992, following the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the events of the Afghan Civil War.\n\n\n== Commandos under the Kingdom of Afghanistan ==\nThe history of special units within the Afghan Armed Forces dates back to early 1964 when the 242nd Parachute Battalion was established, the Royal Afghan Army’s first elite formation which was an independent battalion, subordinate to the General Staff. Sardar Abdul Wali, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Central Army Corps, established the battalion in order to suppress demonstrations, riots in the capital Kabul, and to prevent potential coup attempts. Command of the battalion was passed down to Capt. Habibullah, who recently completed the Infantry Officers’ Advanced Course and airborne training in Fort Benning, United States. The 242nd Parachute Battalion was stationed in Sherpur Fort, northwest Kabul where they conducted airborne training in Bagram and Jalalabad.\nDuring the summer of 1967, the 444th Commando Battalion was formed by Sardar Abdul Wali, becoming the Royal Afghan Army’s second elite formation and the most important commando unit in Afghanistan's military history. The 444th Commando Battalion was commanded by Lt. Col. Aqel Shah, who later passed it to Maj. Rahmatullah Safi, who received in the British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Soviet Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School. The battalion was stationed in Bala Hissar fortress in the southern outskirts of Kabul, being airborne-qualified and under the control of the 1st Central Army Corps. To properly accommodate the new commando formations, they were given access to BTR-40 personnel carriers, tanks and other military equipment. Gen. Khushal Peroz, of 444th Commando, also stated they were the first unit in the Royal Afghan Army to use the AK-47 rifle. The early commando and parachute battalion's officer base was primarily made up of the Afghan aristocracy and those close to Sardar Abdul Wali, fearing a potential coup attempt from Mohammad Daoud Khan.\n\n\n=== Uniform specifications ===\nUnder the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah, more specifically in 1964, the 242nd Parachute Battalion wore locally produced one-piece olive drab overalls, inspired by those worn by the Soviet Airborne Forces, as well as metal airborne wings with a black cloth backing. They additionally wore a black sleeve badge depicting a silver bullion airborne cap with wheat and red thunderbolts on each side. In 1967, the 444th Commando Battalion wore the standard khaki Afghan Army uniform, as well as a distinct blue patch with a singular red lightning flash and jump wings with a light blue cloth backing. The Afghan commandos wore Soviet-style pilotkas, adorned with a small metal pin of the Royal Afghan Army’s insignia or a military variant of Afghanistan’s national emblem. The commandos became the first unit in the Afghan Army to use Frog Skin camouflage two-piece uniforms in 1969, initially imported from the Soviet Union. In 1970, paratroopers also resorted to using Frog Skin camouflage. Maroon berets additionally become part of the commando headdress, pulled down to the right.\n\n\n=== Operations under the Kingdom of Afghanistan ===\nOn 24 May 1970, the first documented commando operation took place, involving the suppression of anti-government protests by the Islamic clergy. Up to 1500–3000 mullahs from the eastern and southern regions of Afghanistan travelled to Kabul’s Pul-e Khishti Mosque and protested against:\n\nThe activities of the PDPA and a publication of newspaper “Parcham” which celebrated the centenary for Vladimir Lenin’s birth\n“Anti-religious” films being shown on television about Prophet Yusuf\nDisplays of caricatures of Prophet Mohammed and his number of marriages being quoted by foreign press outlets and the leftist “Esalat” newspaper (which is still in existence)\nSardar Abdul Wali ordered units of the Royal Afghan Army, such as the 717th Civil Disciplinary Regiment, to remove the protestors by force and use buses to deport them out of Kabul, back to their homes. The 717th arrived at Pul-e Khishti Mosque at 2:00am, with the 444th Commando Battalion arriving with tanks and armoured vehicles, led by Col. Rahmatullah Safi. The protestors performed a sleep-in outside of the mosque and inside its courtyard as a form of peaceful protest, as soldiers attempted to wake them up and make them leave the area. As a result of the protestors not leaving the mosque, the soldiers used their gunstocks to disperse the crowd, as they reluctantly moved towards Maiwand Road where the supplementary buses were parked to deport the protestors from the capital. The protestors reluctantly went inside the buses, shouting “Death to Abdul Wali” and “Allahu Akbar”.\n\n\n== Commandos under the Republic of Afghanistan ==\nBetween 1972 and 1973, the 455th Commando Battalion was being formed at Bala Hissar fortress as the Royal Afghan Army’s third elite formation. Before the battalion could come to full strength, Daoud Khan successfully managed to depose Zahir Shah and the Afghan monarchy during the 1973 Afghan coup d'etat in 17 July. Leftist junior officers of the 242nd Parachute Battalion offered their support to Republican elements taking part in the coup, with the 444th Commando Battalion being heavily involved. After the coup, Capt. Hashem Wardak was promoted to the rank of Major and given command of 242nd Para.\n\nAfter briefly being used as palace guards at the Arg Presidential Palace, the 444th Commando Battalion were moved to Jalalabad from Kabul, leaving the 455th Commando Battalion as the only formation in Bala Hissar fortress, under the command of Maj. Hashem Zadran. Between 1975–1977, under the presidency of Mohammed Daoud Khan, three more commando formations were established; the 466th Commando Battalion, 2nd Army Corps (Kandahar), the 666th Commando Battalion, 3rd Army Corps (Khost, Nadir Shah Kot) and a supposed 777th Commando Battalion stationed in Gardez, also under the control of the 3rd Army Corps. \n\n\n=== Uniform specifications ===\nIn 1974, the Afghan commandos received the Italian M1929 Telo mimetico camouflage, produced locally from fabric printed within Afghanistan. In the mid-1970s, the commandos additionally received a unique orange-green “splinter” camouflage manufactured in Afghanistan.\n\n\n=== Operations under the Republic of Afghanistan ===\nOn 17 July 1973, the 444th Commando Battalion would become the main striking force of Republican elements during the 1973 Afghan coup d'état. Under the leadership of Capt. Faiz Mohammed, the Chief of Operations of the 444th Commando Battalion, the commandos seized Kabul International Airport and the Arg Royal Palace at midnight, disarmed the Royal Guard and coordinated the arrests of members of the royal family such as Crown Prince Ahmad Shah and Lt. General Abdul Wali Khan. As a result of Faiz Mohammed leading part of the battalion in support of Daoud, he was promoted to the rank of Major and given command of the battalion, purging it of royalist elements. As a further reward, Faiz Mohammed became the Minister of Interior and command of the 444th Commando Battalion was given to Maj. Hedayatullah.\nIn 1974, soldiers of the 444th Commando Battalion were sent to the city of Jalalabad due to skirmishes along the Afghan-Pakistani border, also known as the Durand Line. A year later, in 1975, 444th Commando would be sent to Panjshir Valley in order to quell an uprising started by Ahmad Shah Massoud (then-22 years old) and Gulbuddin Hekmetyar, being assisted by the Iranian SAVAK and the Pakistani ISI. Although the 1975 Panjshir Valley Uprising saw initial success, with a military garrison being taken by the rebels in Rokha District, the 444th Commando Battalion (in assistance with the Afghan Air Force) successfully engaged with the armed militants, ending in a complete victory for the Afghan government, resulting in Massoud and Hekmetyar fleeing to Pakistan and any form of rebellion in Panjshir being crushed. In the same year, the 444th Commando Battalion were sent to Laghman to quell the 1975 Laghman uprising by armed Islamists, targeting government headquarters. The rebels faced defeat, being arrested upon arrival, as well as Jamiat-e Islami commander Mawlawi Habib Rahman.\n\n\n== Commandos under the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan ==\nOn 27 April 1978, armed forces units loyal to the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan deposed President Daoud Khan, overthrew the Republican government and established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, during the Saur Revolution. The commando battalions would find themselves becoming the victims of in-fighting, as the 444th, 455th Commando Battalions and the 242nd Parachute \nBattalion fought amongst each other. Communists within the 242nd Para neutralised the battalion to ensure soldiers didn't intervene on behalf of President Daoud Khan, meanwhile Bala Hissar barracks were set on fire by the PDPA-affiliated rebels to distract and immobilise the 455th Commando Battalion. \nDuring the final hours of the coup, Lt. Imauddin, an officer of the 444th Commando Battalion, and Gul Aqa, chief of the Republican Guard Brigade, both ordered Daoud Khan to surrender. Daoud Khan refused and as a result, Imauddin shot him, although he was injured by a bullet fired by Daoud. Two commando officers, Babrak Khan and Ibrahim, who took part in the killing of Daoud Khan and his family were interviewed by Soviet media in 1980. It is alleged by the Afghan diaspora that Imauddin now resides in Sacramento, California. Additionally, Lt.Gen Shahnawaz Tanai, would also take part in the coup, being photographed standing outside the gates of the Arg Presidential Palace. Tanai took command of the 444th Commando Battalion on the early morning of the 28th of April.\nDirectly after the coup, the 455th Commando and 242nd Para were combined into the 26th Airborne Regiment, stationed at Bala Hissar fortress. A reorganisation and redesignation of the commando formations took place, still retaining their numerical designation. For example, the 444th Commando Battalion was now the 444th Commando Regiment. As a result of the Khalq's disastrous social reforms, land reforms, political purges and their oppression of the Afghan population; the Islamic clergy, regular civilians, Maoists and Parchamites, uprisings began in provinces such as Nuristan and Khost that the commandos would have to deal with, as well as seeing limited combat against the growing Mujahideen factions.\n\n\n=== Kerala Massacre (1979) ===\nOn 20 April 1979, the 444th Commando Regiment and the 11th Division of the Afghan Army committed the Kerala massacre, indiscriminately killing 1,000 civilians including women, children, the elderly and the disabled. Major Saddiq Alamyar, the commander of the 444th Commando during the massacre, was arrested by the Karmal administration. He was jailed for a decade before the government collapsed in 1992, as he fled Afghanistan and sought refuge in the Netherlands. He was detained in October 2015, aged 64, although the case against him was ultimately dropped by the Dutch Office of Prosecutors due to a lack of evidence. Alamyar still resides in Rotterdam.\n\n\n=== Bala Hissar uprising ===\nBy mid-1979, anti-communist dissent was also starting to emerge within the Afghan Armed Forces, being evident through the defection of the 17th Division during the 1979 Herat uprising. The 26th Airborne Regiment would prove to be politically unreliable as on 15 August 1979, the 26th Airborne and elements of the 444th Commando Regiment partook in the Maoist-led Bala Hissar uprising. The commando mutineers clashed with pro-government forces within the 26th Airborne and 32nd Motorized Infantry Regiment inside the fortress. The mutineers were met with ruthless air bombardment by the Khalq government's MiG aircraft, Mi-24 helicopter gunships (given by the USSR after the 1979 Herat uprising), tanks, AGSA intelligence officers and paramilitary forces under the Ministry of Interior. The battle lasted for five hours, with the revolt being crushed and leaving 400 dead. Tens of Maoist cadres and commando mutineers were arrested and executed in Pul-e Charkhi prison, such as Mohammed Daoud and Mohammed Mohsin. After the uprising, the 444th, 455th and 466th Commando Regiments were converted into battalions once more, with the 444th Commando being moved from Kabul to Surobi and having their commander changed.\nOn 8 October 1979, Hafizullah Amin had Nur Muhammad Taraki assassinated after being informed of a murder plot which was to be perpetrated by the “Gang of Four” and later assumed power, becoming the new president of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Only days later, on 15 October 1979, the 444th Commando Battalion were ordered to suppress yet another rebellion launched by Afghan Army mutineers of the 7th Division in Rishkhor, located in the southwestern outskirts of Kabul. On 27 December 1979, being alarmed by the implications and consequences of Hafizullah Amin’s tenure, the Soviet Union launched Operation Storm-333 and assaulted Tajbeg Palace, conducted by the KGB, GRU, and the Soviet Airborne Forces. The operation was successful, leading to the assassination of Hafizullah Amin and the installation of Parchamite leader Babrak Karmal. This would be the catalyst and the preliminary for the Soviet-Afghan War.\nAs part of Baikal-79, a larger operation aimed at taking 20 key strongholds in and around Kabul, the Soviet 105th Airborne Division secured the city and disarmed Afghan Army units without facing opposition. On 1 January 1980, Soviet paratroopers ordered the 26th Airborne Regiment in Bala Hissar to disarm, only for them to refuse and fire upon the Soviets as a firefight ensued. The Soviet paratroopers annihilated most of the regiment, with 700 Afghan paratroopers being killed or captured. In the aftermath of the battle, 26th Airborne Regiment was disbanded and later reorganised into the 37th Commando Brigade, led by Col. Shahnawaz Tanai, being the largest commando formation at a strength of three battalions. As a result of the battle with the 26th Airborne Regiment, the Soviet 357th Guards Airborne Regiment were permanently stationed in Bala Hissar fortress, meaning this new brigade was stationed as Rishkhor Garrison. In the same year, the 81st Artillery Brigade was given airborne training and converted into the 38th Commando Brigade, stationed in Mahtab Qala (lit. Moonlit Fortress) garrison southwest of Kabul under the command of Brig. Tawab Khan.\nIn 1980, there were also plans for three special forces battalions to be created in each of the army's corps, being officially deployed in 1981 as the:\n\n203rd Special Purpose Battalion (1st Central Corps, Kabul)\n212th Special Purpose Battalion (2nd Army Corps, Kandahar)\n230th Special Purpose Battalion (3rd Army Corps, Gardez)\nThey were also referred to as “SpN”, being a simple abbreviation of the namings of all three special battalions, as well as reconnaissance battalions and even Spetsnaz. They directly reported to the Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Afghan Armed Forces, also known as KhAD-e-Nezami. The 203rd SpN notably took part in the Marmoul offensives and the Battles of Zhawar. Additional formations additionally included the 625th, 626th, 627th, 628th, 629th Operative Battalions, the 477th Commando Battalion in Gardez, the 886th Commando Battalion in Herat and the 665th Commando Battalion in Kandahar International Airport.\nIn the same year, the 37th Commando Brigade and the 666th Commando Regiment were brought into battle in Kandahar. There was additional information that a possible Afghan 344th Commando Battalion took part in Operation Strike with the Soviet 350th Guards Separate Parachute Battalion of the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, although no Afghan battalion with such a designation could be found.\nIn September 1982, the commando brigades saw heavy action in Panjshir against the Mujahideen fighters of Jamiat-e Islami. By 1983, the commando brigades were among the most reliable combat units at the disposal of the Afghan Army, seeing constant action and taking heavy casualties. In August 1983, the 37th Commando launched a successful air assault operation on Khost, additionally fighting in the province of Paktia. After their successes, they were airlifted into Kabul in October. In April 1984, a Soviet-Afghan task force; including the 37th Commando Brigade, launched Operation Panjshir 7. This task force moved into Panjshir and managed to clear several parts of the valley from Jamiat-e Islami fighters for the first time since 1979. In August, the 38th Commando Brigade were ordered to break a siege in Ali Khel in Paktia, and the 444th Commando Battalion was conducting operations in Kunar Valley.\nIn 1985, a Soviet shift towards small-unit tactics led to an increase in Afghan commando operations. This resulted in the 444th Commando Battalion suffering an 80% casualty rate while conducting spring offensives in Panjshir. In the same year, a Soviet-Afghan task force successfully broke a siege in Barikot, Kunar Valley and closed the Afghan-Pakistani border, although this led to 73 commandos being killed and 30 being captured. Although, not all operations led to success as the 38th Commando Brigade were forced to retreat from Peshgur, Panjshir. The 37th Commando Brigade was sent to reinforce Khost in July. In the same year, in 1985, Afghan commandos received Bulgarian camouflage. During this period, one portrait photograph suggests the commandos also wore light green berets, although only a single image depicts this.\n\n\n=== First and Second Battles of Zhawar and end of Commandos ===\nIn September 1985, the 12th Infantry Division and elements from the 37th and 38th Commando Brigades moved from Gardez to Khost in order to capture Zhawar, a Mujahideen logistics transfer base in Paktia built using bulldozers and explosives. The attack force paired with the 25th Infantry Division, already stationed in Khost, with Shahnawaz Tanai commanding this joint force, being from the neighbouring town of Tani and enjoying popular support in the area. The DRA force launched an attack on Bori, supported by artillery fire and air strikes from the Afghan Air Force. The Mujahideen force in Zhawar were underprepared as most of its major commanders, including Jalaluddin Haqqani, were in Saudi Arabia, Mecca performing the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. The joint force managed to successfully capture Bori, advancing into Zhawar. The Mujahideen, however, led a successful counterattack and blocked the ridge on the eastern slope of the Moghulgai mountains. During the fighting, the DRA force lost two APCs and four trucks, withdrawing and returning to Khost to possibly perform reconnaissance. Kochi nomads and Gorbez mujahideen also recaptured Bori. The DRA task force, along with the two commando brigades, captured the town of Lezhi and managed to kill Commander Mawlawi Ahmad Gul. The Mujahideen in Lezhi retreated south as a 20-man unit blocked the Manay Kandow pass. The DRA forces spent 10 days trying to break through, to no avail, despite the use of air strikes and artillery barrages. The DRA forces then called in air strikes from both the Afghan Air Force and the Soviet Air Forces, leading the mujahideen to retreat on 14 September 1985. The joint force established observation posts and then took control of Tor Kamar, becoming careless as they assumed the mujahideen didn't have any heavy weaponry. Two defected tank commanders then fired upon an artillery spotting observation post, sending soldiers flying, using a T-55. The tankers then fired upon other DRA soldiers, including the 37th and 38th Commando Brigades as they withdrew. After 42 days of fighting, Shahnawaz Tanai broke contact and planned to withdraw his joint attack force at night. The First Battle of Zhawar concluded with a victory for the mujahideen.\nA year later, in 1986, the Afghan Ministry of Defense decided to destroy Zhawar. The 7th, 8th, 14th and 25th Infantry Divisions, the 38th Commando Brigade and the 666th “Air Assault” Commando Regiment were committed to the operation. Gen. Nabi Azimi was the overall commander of the Afghan group of forces, whereas Maj. Gen. Mohammed Asif Delawar was appointed the leader of the Afghan ground forces. The 38th Commando Brigade was committed to conduct an air assault on Dawri Gar mountain, rising 3,600 metres above sea level. On 28 February 1986, Afghan government forces moved from Gardez towards Zhawar, being aided by the Soviet Air Force and the Soviet 191th Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment. When the Afghan force moved to Matwarkh, they stopped moving and stayed in the region for a month. The mujahideen used this to their advantage and started shelling them, with the Afghan forces taking casualties but still not moving forwards. The 25th Infantry Division moved out of Khost, engaging the mujahideen and later looting three villages and destroying them, later moving to secure Naray Pass so DRA forces could move forwards. On 2 April 1986, six Mi-8 helicopters flew from Khost Airfield to insert an assault group from the 38th Commando Brigade, only to meet heavy resistance once they commenced their ground assault. The air assault group commander reported that the firing was far away from his location, as a DRA artillery brigade fired illumination rounds at 3:00am and asked the commandos if they could see the round, to which they replied that it was 10 kilometres away. The commandos then realised that they landed 5 kilometres inside Pakistan, as the air assault group commander quietly told the command post “I understand. We will withdraw”. One hour later, he reported that they were surrounded and locked in combat. Mawlawi Nezamuddin Haqqani saw large groups of helicopters flying in the same direction, escorted by jet fighters, therefore deciding to radio Jalaluddin Haqqani who set out for Zhawar immediately. Mujahideen intelligence agents within the DRA failed to find out that the rest of the 38th Commando Brigade were landed on seven landing zones around Zhawar. Following the air assault, the Soviet Air Forces bombed Mujahideen positions. The Mujahideen then attacked the landing zones of 38th Commando, overrunning four of them and capturing 530 commandos. A single group of Afghan commandos managed to hold out against the mujahideen for three days before being finally overrun. The chief of counter-reconnaissance in one of the commando brigades managed to lead 24 commandos to safety, which took 8 days. In order to reinforce the DRA forces, the 11th and 18th Infantry Divisions, 21st Mechanised Infantry Brigade, 203rd Special Purpose Battalion and the 37th Commando Brigade arrived, alongside 5 Soviet battalions. Pakistani officers were additionally sent to Zhawar and attempted to take down Afghan and Soviet aircraft with English blowpipes to no avail, as one Pakistani officer and his NCO were injured as a result of the aerial bombardment. The operation additionally saw the involvement of 100 Pakistani Special Service Group (SSG) operatives and Arab mujahideen volunteers.\nOn 17 April 1986, a DRA force moved towards Moghulgai mountain, leading to the Mujahideen fleeing without engaging. News soon spread that Jalaluddin Haqqani was wounded by the aerial bombardment, and rumours circulated that Haqqani was killed. As a result, the Mujahideen abandoned Zhawar and on 19 April 1986, DRA and Soviet forces entered the area. Nabi Azimi then issued orders to arrest the helicopter regiment commander due to the botched landing, with other pilots claiming that he was in hiding and that he explicitly told them to land where they did. The joint DRA-Soviet forces began to destroy the caves of Zhawar, using sappers. They then planted seismic mines and PFM-1 mines in the area before leaving, having only stayed in Zhawar for five hours, and the traps were triggered a day later by the Mujahideen who returned to Zhawar. The Second Battle of Zhawar was regarded as a DRA-Soviet victory, although the Mujahideen managed to destroy 24 helicopters and two jets, as well as capture 530 personnel from the 38th Commando Brigade. Jalaluddin Haqqani tried and executed Colonel Qalandar Shah alongside 78 other officers who were forced to “confess their crimes” from different operations and then executed. However, regular soldiers were given amnesty as they were conscripts and were ordered to complete two years of labour if they wanted to be fully amnestied. After sustaining heavy casualties, the commando brigades were converted into battalions.\nAccounts from a Kandahari veteran of the 444th Commando Battalion suggest that it might’ve been the 37th Commando Brigade that landed inside Pakistan, not the 38th. This could be true as during the celebration of Afghan Independence Day on 19 August 1986, after celebrating the DRA-Soviet victory in the Second Battle of Zhawar a few months prior, Defense Minister Lt.Gen. Nazar Mohammed gave the nickname “hero” to the 37th Commando Battalion, 322nd Fighter Aviation Regiment and the 2nd Border Brigade, awarding them with the “Hero of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan” medal. Out of the first four Afghans who were awarded this medal, two of them were commandos: Lt.Col Faiz Mohammed (posthumously) and Lt. Juma Khan from the 37th “Hero” Commando Battalion.\nThe Commando Brigades were, in contrast, considered reliable and were used as mobile strike forces until they sustained excessive casualties. Insurgents ambushed and inflicted heavy casualties on the 37th Commando Brigade during the Second Battle of Zhawar in Paktika Province in April 1986. After sustaining heavy casualties, the commando brigades were turned into battalions. During a 1988 parade commemorating the soldiers who fought in the Siege of Khost, the commandos wore grey and olive green ties underneath their uniform, brown tanker gloves, as well as triband sashes of the Afghan flag and one unique red-silver sash. In other parades, photographs show the commandos wearing white dress gloves.\nFormerly a sergeant, Lt. Juma Khan received his first officer rank for numerous combat distinctions, similar to many other Afghan platoon or company commanders who not only lacked specialist training but also secondary level education. However, the number of officers who managed to complete a brief training course increased and 10-15 graduates of the military university joined the commando forces annually. In 1986, the Afghan Commando Forces underwent another significant reformation as the 444th Commando Battalion was reorganised into a brigade, consisting of six battalions. Since 1983, 444th Commando were stationed in Panjshir, being the only divisional commando formation, part of the 2nd Infantry Division. The remaining commando and special formations, such as the 37th, 38th and 466th Commando Battalions, 666th “Air Assault” Commando Regiment, 203rd, 212th and 230th SpN battalions became part of a new “Afghan Airborne Assault Commando Force”. This new combined formation was to be fully equipped with armaments, for which the Ministry of Interior and State Security (WAD) were obligated to allocate hundreds of their personnel. The 84th and 85th Commando Battalion was additionally formed in 1987 to be part of the airborne assault force, with plans for four separate battalions to also join this new force. However, this plan was abandoned.\nAdditionally, Afghan commandos were taught the Soviet martial art of ARB and a select few paratroopers of the 37th Commando Brigade were taught how to use Nunchaku by the Soviet Airborne Forces.\nAnnually, the commandos lost around 10% of their personnel due to the sheer number of combat operations they had to undertake, with two-thirds of this percentage also being deserters or captured commandos. Despite this, they were the most formidable and combat-ready force at the disposal of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In 1988, the 37th Commando Battalion and the three SpN battalions only had a one-week break between combat operations. Nevertheless, recruits for the Afghan Commando Forces still displayed eagerness to join, wanting to receive jump wings and a maroon beret.\nIn the same year, the Air Assault Commando Force was disbanded due to the Soviet withdrawal of Afghanistan and due to a shortage of forces defending cities such as Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar, Herat and many others. All commando battalions and regiments were placed under the control of the commanders of the three army corps. Despite this, Afghan commandos still wore their jump wings and their commando formation insignia on their right shoulder, which was later carried over to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\nIn 1988, the Afghan National Guard (‘Gard-e-Mili’, previously referred to as the Afghan Special Guard ‘Gard-e-Khas’ and Guards Corps) was formed, with the 37th and 38th Commando Battalions being assigned to it. However, according to Conboy, both battalions retained their independence and did not become part of the Afghan National Guard, being moved to Bala Hissar fortress. The 37th and 38th Commando were later reconverted into brigades and remained in a reserve capacity, ensuring that they could be rapidly deployed to address any situations and in 1989, during the Battle of Jalalabad, the 37th and 38th Commando Battalions were present during the defence of the city against ISI-supported Mujahideen forces.\nIn 1990, Defense Minister Shahnawaz Tanai utilised a single battalion of the 37th Commando Brigade, with the other two battalions being deployed to Jalalabad during the 1990 Afghan coup attempt. The coup attempt failed, being thwarted by the Afghan National Guard led by Gen. Khushal Peroz, military university students, the Afghan Army’s 10th Division, 717th Civil Disciplinary Regiment, the Sarandoy’s 8th Gendarme Brigade, and WAD’s 1st and 5th Directorates. In 1991, the 666th Commando Regiment was decimated by the Mujahideen during the Siege of Khost, and in April 1992, the Afghan government collapsed. Information about what happened to other commando and special formations is unavailable, however, they were not listed among the formations under the control of the Mujahideen in the spring of 1992. According to rumours, Shahnawaz Tanai managed to recruit commando officers into the ranks of the Taliban, in which they fought the Mujahideen from 1994 to 1996.\n\n\n== Afghan parachutist badges ==\n\n\n=== Parachutist badges of the Afghan commando battalions ===\nThe Afghan commando forces had four classes of parachutist badges worn on the chest, usually with a red, blue or black material behind the badge. Out of the four classes, three of them have stars which indicate the experience of the paratrooper donning them on their uniform, such as:\n\nFirst-class badge (three stars, equivalent to Master Paratrooper)\nSecond-class badge (two stars, awarded for several dozen jumps in a combat situation)\nThird-class badge (one star, awarded for jumps in a combat situation)\nFourth-class badge (no star, given to new paratrooper recruits)\nThe concept of the paratrooper badges have remained unchanged ever since their inception under the Afghan monarchy, although there have been multiple variants of these badges that are designated by “series” or by “type”. There are three series of these parachutist badges, such as:\n\nType 1\nThe first design of the Afghan parachutist badge under the Kingdom of Afghanistan, being of very poor quality\nType 2\nThe second design of the Afghan parachutist badge, being a smaller size with a light metal construction and a “gold” colour, although there is a silver grey variant. The wings are straight, appearing to be flying upwards sharply\nType 3\nThe third design of the Afghan parachutist badge, having rounded and curved wings on each side and being silver\nFormer paratroopers could still be seen wearing their parachutist badges under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, such as Khatool Mohammadzai, Sher Mohammad Karimi and Abdul Rashid Dostum, who wears two parachutist badges.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was first formally described in 1803 by French botanist André Michaux, as Physcia exilis. Finnish lichenologist Edvard Vainio transferred the taxon to the genus Teloschistes in 1890. The lichen is found in the Americas. Secondary metabolites (lichen products) that have been identified from the lichen include parietin and teloschistin.\nA form of the lichen described by Vilmos Kőfaragó-Gyelnik in 1938, Teloschistes exilis f. inaequalis Gyeln., has been proposed to represent a synonym of Teloschistes nodulifer, after researchers studied Kofarago-Gyelnik's original type material that was collected from Argentina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2007-04-03 01:08:31",
        "content": "Historias del Kronen is the first novel by Madrid-born Spanish author José Ángel Mañas, with which he was a finalist for the Premio Nadal in January 1994. Published by Spanish publishing house Ediciones Destino in 1994—when the author was only 23 years old, and which he claims he wrote in only 15 days—it is the first book by the author in the so-called \"Kronen Tetralogy,\" along with Mensaka, Ciudad rayada, and Sonko95. It was adapted to the screen by director Montxo Armendáriz in 1995 and translated both into German—Die Kronen-Bar—and into Dutch. The novel has been considered a success and a best seller. Literarily speaking, it belongs to Generation X.\n\n\n== Detailed description of the plot ==\n\nThe novel takes place during the month of July 1992 in the city of Madrid. Carlos is the main protagonist. He's a young university student, barely 21 years old, who is described as a \"spoiled brat,\" self-centered, and lacking empathy, whose life revolves only around alcohol, drugs, and sex. He often meets his friends at the Kronen, his favorite (fictitious) bar, located in the novel in the vicinity of Francisco Silvela Street in Madrid. In the book, he is described as a sociopath. Carlos experiences a progressive process of isolation, alienation, and \"solipsistic introversion\" that eventually leads to the novel's climax, in which the death of one of his friends—Fierro, a diabetic who has a weak personality and whom the gang believes is a homosexual, apart from a masochist—takes place at his own birthday party, resulting from being forced to drink a bottle of whisky through a funnel and putting cocaine on his penis, which leads to a fatal overdose.\n\n\n== Structure and style ==\n\nThe book's original cover included a silk-screen printing of Andy Warhol's 5 Deaths on Orange (Orange Disaster)—a crashed car with the dead body of a woman underneath it. The novel opens and ends with the lyrics from Giant, a song by British band The The. Narrated in the first person—through Carlos's point of view— it stresses the dizzying, very fluid rhythm, thanks to the dynamic dialogue that makes up most of the novel, alternated with narrated fragments. The visual component of the novel has also been praised.\nIn order to emphasize the fleeting and frivolous nature of the novel's narrative, the author makes use of the resource of inserting strings of location names, in which he omits verbs or articles, or even pronouns. Historias del Kronen is also characterized by the precise description of the place where the action unfolds, mentioning real places around Madrid, such as the Plaza del Dos de Mayo square, the Parque de las Avenidas park, the Las Ventas bullfighting ring, or the Gran Vía street, among others. The style used by Mañas in the book has been referred to as slightly monotonous. Despite this, he manages to reach a point of narrative tension by the end of the novel. This ending, which culminates in Fierro's death—one of Carlos's friends—has been praised by its original style in the form of a monologue. One hallmark of the narrative is also the constant recurrence to slang expressions used by young people, by putting them in the mouths of the protagonists. In this sense, some of the terms that stand out include the constant use by Carlos of the offensive term cerdas to refer to women; neologisms; or the appearance of colloquialisms that refer to the world of drugs, such as: costo, chocolate, tripi,, farlopa, or nevadito. The use of offensive or dysphemistic expressions is common in the slang used by the young people in the novel. Mañas also resorts to the insertion of numerous musical references in the book, even including song lyrics by bands such as The The, Nirvana (Come as You Are and Drain You), Siniestro Total (Bailaré sobre tu tumba), or Los Ronaldos (Sí, sí).\n\n\n== Context and influences ==\n\nHistorias del Kronen represents the conversion of the U.S. cultural concept of Generation X to the Spanish society. In fact, it has been considered one of the definitive novels of this generational movement in Spain, which has been called, precisely, \"Generation Kronen.\" The novel is considered to be neo-realist in style.\nIt has been compared to Douglas Coupland's Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture—the novel that popularized the term Generation X—and it has even been mentioned that it could be its \"Spanish version.\" On the other hand, it has been said that Historias del Kronen contains parallelisms with Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (1926), Carmen Laforet's Nada (1945), or Juan Marsé's Últimas tardes con Teresa (1966), as well as Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio's El Jarama (1955), due to the realism of these novels. Mañas even agreed with this latter comparison, although, according to him, the style is profoundly different. The author has also spoken about the supposedly strong resemblance that Historias del Kronen has with Bret Easton Ellis's Less than Zero (1985), saying that both are different as the nature of the former is menos descriptivo y más hosco, as well as more abierto socialmente, apart from claiming that he hadn't read Ellis's first novel before he wrote Historias del Kronen. Mañas mentioned Warhol, Camus's L'Étranger, and Raymond Carver as his main influences.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nPositive reviews highlight Mañas's \"amazing\" ability to capture the language of young people and to use it to set each character apart. The book was very well received by readers thanks to its \"authenticity.\" However, the book has received very mixed reviews, with critics pointing out its supposed nature as a novela cutre, as well as its realismo sucio, in a pejorative sense, and also drawing attention to its alleged imitation of the dirty realism that originated in the United States. It has also been said about the book that, by enhancing realism in the narration of the facts as a sort of social commentary, it runs the risk of being only a superficial imitation of the society it is attempting to describe. More critical authors point out that the narration consists of an \"endless reiteration of inane conversations\" among the characters and the lack of \"substance\" of the novel, filled with \"an incessant chattering, a bit crude, full of unoriginal phrases and conventionalisms.\" In any case, Historias del Kronen sold more than 100,000 copies, which represented an unprecedented success in Spanish literature at the time.\n\n\n== Analysis and themes ==\n\nThe novel portrays young people in 1990s Spain, the vacío existencial and isolation of many of them, and their characteristic disillusionment at failing to find their place in the world, with a pessimistic view of existence and the human condition—common aspects in Generation X writers— added to a perspective influenced by nihilism. Sexuality is an essential theme in Mañas's work, describing sexual relations between his characters in a manner that is explícita y desinhibida. Several of the male characters that appear in Historias del Kronen display a negative view of homosexuality, in contrast to the revelation about the homosexuality of one of them—Roberto—and the potential bisexuality of Carlos, the main character. Also palpable in the novel is the way that la presión social serves to shape the sexual conduct of the novel's characters. Carlos stresses the importance of the culture of TV, films, and visual media in detriment to poetry and literature.\n\nCualquier película, por mediocre que sea, es más interesante que la realidad cotidiana. Somos los hijos de la televisión, como dice Mat Dilon en Dragstorcauboi.\n\nThe non-profit association Fundación para el Progreso de Madrid chose the novel as one of the ten books that best portray the city. The author himself described the book as Kronen era un Madrid visto a través de la ventanilla de un coche que circula por la Emetreinta, referring to Madrid motorway M-30 and highlighting its symbolism and that of peri-urban areas in the novel. The book also highlights the superficial nature of all of Carlos's relationships, with his characteristic inability to develop empathy towards his surroundings and a behavior referred to that of an alpha male. Moreover, the novel stresses the generational gap between Carlos and his family. The character of Carlos's grandfather functions as a showcase and reflection of the evolution of women throughout the 20th century, precisely through the way he clings to the defense of traditional family values, and women's break with traditional patriarchy which, however, female characters in the novel such as Amalia or Nuria—both of whom are friends of Carlos and who at first are introduced as independent women that break the moldes de género— do not manage to overcome completely. The novel mentions the films The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and A Clockwork Orange, as well as Bret Easton Ellis's novel American Psycho, which Carlos claims to be a fan of and ultimately seem to give shape to his misogynistic and violent behavior. Mañas has admitted that Historias del Kronen has a certain autobiographical component.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nA film based on the novel, directed by Montxo Armendáriz, was released in 1995. One of the main differences between the book and the film is the evolution of the character of Carlos—played by Juan Diego Botto—who, while in the novel does not evolve or improve in any way, in the film does experience in the end a sort of reshuffling of his moral values, possibly due to being affected by his grandfather's death, apart from demonstrating a certain concern for his friends. Thus, in general, he turns out to be a more humane and compassionate person than the character in Mañas's book.\nIn the movie, the novel's ending monologue is replaced by a sequence seen through a video camera that is passed around all the people present at the party, in which Pedro's death—Fierro, in the novel—becomes a sort of snuff film. The movie was criticized for its slightly moralistic tone. It depicts situations that are not present in Mañas's book, such as one scene in which Carlos steals money from his mother and lets the blame fall on the maid, as well as the most emblematic and well-known scene in the movie—included in the poster—in which two youngsters hang from a bridge over the Paseo de la Castellana thoroughfare in Madrid on a dare to see who lasts the longest. Likewise, the harshness of some comments appears to have been toned down in the film which, in a sense, is an edulcorada version of the book.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn 2019, Mañas published La última juerga, a sequel to Historias del Kronen.\n\n\n== References in music ==\nThe novel is mentioned in the song Luis XIV by Spanish rapper Mitsuruggy, from his 2014 album The Coach.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStories from the Kronen\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHistorias del Kronen at IMDb , film adaptation of the novel\nAndy Warhol's 5 Deaths on Orange (Orange Disaster) (1963), artwork depicted on the original cover of the book",

Turkish and Palestinian flags were flown. Many professors and other students attended the rally, where speeches in Turkish, Arabic, and English were made. A group of Turkish nationalists had also hosted a rally nearby commemorating Turkism Day. The Pro-Palestinians later began shouting slogans in Arabic, and takbirs, which provoked the Turkish nationalists into intruding the university and assaulting the students while shouting \"how happy is the one who says I am a Turk\". Security had to intervene and escort the Pro-Palestinians to safety inside the university. Most of the attackers were described as Victory Party members and other Kemalists. Some MHP Grey Wolves and other Idealists were present, where they gave the university students a chance to stop the Arabic chanting, before joining the assaults after the students refused. The attackers referred to themselves as \"Turkists\" and \"nationalists\", and did not specify any political affiliation. After the attacks, members of the \"Ankara Palestine Solidarity Platform\" protested outside the university and demanded justice.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\n== Doornhoek Solar Power Station ==\n\nThe Doornhoek Solar Power Station, is a 120 MW (160,000 hp) solar power station, under development in South Africa. The solar farm is owned and is being developed by AMEA Power LLC, headquartered in the United Arab Emirates. The off-taker is Eskom, the South African national electricity parastatal, under a 20-year power purchase agreement. AMEA Power was awarded the concession to build this solar farm under the sixth round of the South African government's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPP).\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station would be located near the town of Klerksdorp, in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District, in the North West Province of South Africa. Klerksdorp, is located about 172 kilometres (107 mi), southeast of Mahikeng, the provincial capital. The land area hosting the solar farm is reported as 200 hectares (490 acres).\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAMEA Power is a Middle Eastern independent power producer (IPP) active on the African continent focusing on solar generation. This power station is the first for AMEA in South Africa. The design calls for a ground mounted photovoltaic panel layout with generation capacity of 120 megawatts.\n\n\n== Developers ==\nAMEA Power is the lead developer. AMEA has teamed up with two minority shareholders to form the ad hoc joint special purpose vehicle (SPV) company that will own, design, construct, operate and maintain this solar farm. For descriptive purposes we will refer to the SPV company as Doornhoek Solar Consortium, whose composition is as illustrated in the table below.\n\n\n== Construction timetable and funding ==\nConstruction is expected to start in H1 of 2024 and conclude in May 2026. The construction budget is reported to be US$120 million. The development has received financial support in form of loans from Standard Bank of South Africa and from the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC).\n\n\n== Other considerations ==\nThis power station is expected to deliver 120 MW of clean renewable electricity, equivalent to 325 GWh on an annual basis, enough to power 97,000 South African homes and to offset 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of power stations in South Africa\n Renewable energy portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAMEA Power Signs Groundbreaking 20-Year PPA for 120MW Doornhoek Solar PV Project in South Africa, Spearheading Renewable Energy Revolution",

The contest, held on June 26 at the HZ Hotel in Patos de Minas, consisted of 18 finalists, of whom a model Gabriela Borges was elected the winner. Borges later participated in the national pageant held the following year and was named the first runner-up.\nLater in late 2023, Edy Godoy organized the state pageant to select a representative for the 2024 national contest; however, the 2024 state winner, Elen Guedes, had to withdraw from the national event due to the change of national franchise holder, and the state license for Miss Grand Paraná 2024 was granted to another organizer.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Paraná's annual editions since 2021.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of representatives of the state of Paraná in the Miss Grand Brazil national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Brazil at Wikimedia Commons",

The film's title is named after a song in Chowka (2017). The film was released to mixed-to-negative reviews.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA critic from Deccan Herald wrote that \"With repackaged content and crude execution, one has little to lose by skipping the film\". A critic from The Times of India rated the film two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"Director Atharv Arya tackles a relevant subject, but the treatment remains mediocre. Tabla Nani shines in his role as Dharmanna, while Prem and Manvitha deliver commendable performances within their limited screen time\". A critic from Cinema Express gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"Appa I Love You is a film that might prompt a few to reconsider their approach with their parents and in-laws, especially regarding adoption. However, the film could have benefitted from a fresh approach\". A critic from Times Now rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Despite its strong message at the end, Appa I Love You emerges as a drama that struggles to retain your interest in it\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAppa I Love You at IMDb",

Mhalla is an associate researcher with the Laboratory of political anthropology, a joint project of CNRS and EHESS.\nShe is a lecturer at Sciences Po and École Polytechnique.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nShe was awarded a scholarship to study in France in the prestigious Classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles of the parisian establishment Janson de Sailly.\nShe was subsequently admitted to ESCP Business School. She did not take any interest in the business studies at ESCP. After graduation, Mhalla worked in investment banking at BNP Paribas and consulting, an experience that she praised for structuring her approach to work.\nShe left her job in 2016 due to a stay in hospital and illness. During that time Mhalla took an interest in political theory and technosurveillance issues reading the work of Bernard Harcourt.\nFollowing a publication of her first article on tech policy in the Huffington Post, Harcourt and Mhalla established a collaboration.\n\n\n== Tech policy and Big Tech Governance ==\nMhalla is a political scientist and tech policy expert. Her writing deals with democratic and geopolitical challenges of our times, such as big tech governance, tech sovereignty and disinformation.\nShe was called upon to analyze tech issues ranging from disinformation to the political power of the Big Tech, political stakes of generative AI and the social media democratic challenges.\nIn February 2024, Mhalla published an essay Technopolitique. Mhalla argued in her book that technology is ultimately structuring new forms of power and our relationship to democracy.\nShe warned against the political power wielded by Big Tech, which seems illegitimate in the absence of a democratic mandate.\n\n\n== References ==",
