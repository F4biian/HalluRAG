        "content": "Ngaherehere was a  Māori rangatira in the upper Wairoa River valley in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. He probably lived around the eighteenth century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIn his account of the history of Ngati Kahungunu, J. H. Mitchell expesses uncertainty about Ngaherehere's origins, but says that he came from Mahia peninsula or Whakaki.  His parents were Kopura, through whom he was descended from Kahungunu, and Tahu-raumea, through whom he was descended from Tahu Pōtiki.\n\n\n=== Arrival in Wairoa ===\nNgaherehere came into the Wairoa river valley and settled at Matiti (across the river from Ruataniwha pā). Tapuwae Poharutanga o Tukutuku of Ngāi Tamaterangi, who was the main chief in the area, led a force to chase him off. Ngaherehere relocated upriver to Awamate; this time, Tapuwae came out and lit a fire nearby. This signified that Awamate belonged to him and Ngaherehere therefore moved on again, until him came to Marumaru, where he established a pā called Te Rapu (\"seeking a place\") and a plantation garden called Tahapaua.\n\n\n=== Battle of Wharekopae ===\n\nWharekopae was a pā upriver from Te Rapu, above Te Reinga Falls, where the Ruakituri and Hangaroa Rivers come together to form the Wairoa. It had two leading chiefs, Tutaki and Puraho, who each controlled one end of the settlement. They quarrelled over an eel pond and Tutaki was killed.\nTutaki's son, Tamaroki, secretly sought vengeance for his father's death. He went downriver to seek a powerful ally to help him, passing Ngaherehere's pā without stopping because he considered him too weak. However, his intended ally, Te Whakahu, refused to intervene in an argument that had nothing to do with him. Returning in failure, Tamaroki stopped at Te Rapu and asked Ngaherehere for help. His response, ha! haere ake nei, hoki mai nei, a, peka mai nei (\"What! going past; returning, and then calling here!\") is proverbial.  But Ngaherehere agreed to help because Tamaroki had gifted him food several times before this.\n\nTamaroki convinced all the inhabitants of Wharekopae to undertake a nighttime expedition to capture New Zealand longfin eel (tuna), splitting Puraho's people into two groups that headed up the Ruakituri and Hangaroa rivers, while his people headed downriver. He set up great fires so that when Puraho's people returned they would feast and fall asleep.\nNgaherehere assigned a neighbouring chief, Whetete, to protect his fields from pukeko and rendezvoused with Tamaroki in the night. Ngaherehere made the proverbial remark ka moe te mata hii tuna, ka ara te mata hii taua (\"the eyes of the eel hunters are closed; the eyes of the man hunters are open\"). Shortly before dawn, he launched his attack, capturing the pā and slaughtering almost all of Puraho's people.  Puraho himself escaped with a small coterie, fleeing towards the Te Arai River. Ngaherehere pursued, and captured a woman, Hopu-ara, on a hill near Tiniroto, whom he spared and married.\nAfter this battle, Wharekopae and Tamaroki's people came under Ngaherehere's authority. They launched several raids against Puraho's people at Te Arai.\n\n\n== Family ==\nNgaherehere married Rurea before he came to Wairoa and had six sons with her, including:\n\nWai-o-tuawatea\nTorere\nParua\nPakura\nNgaherehere married a lady whom he captured at the Battle of Wharekopae, whom he dubbed Hopu-ara (\"caught on the tracks\").\nAs a third wife, Ngaherehere married Tiringa.\nFinally, he married Hine-te-urunga. Their descendants are Ngai Te Aweawe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMitchell, J. H. (2014). Takitimu: A History of Ngati Kahungunu. Libro International. ISBN 978-1-877514-72-2.",

        "content": "Oscar Newman (30 September 1935 – 14 April 2004) was a Canadian-born American architect and researcher most known for his defensible space theory, a precursor to crime prevention through environmental design.\n\n\n== Theory ==\n\nAs defined in Newman's book Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space (1972), defensible space is \"a residential environment whose physical characteristics—building layout and site plan—function to allow inhabitants themselves to become key agents in ensuring their security.\" The theory argues that an area is safer when people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for that piece of a community.  Newman asserts that \"the criminal is isolated because his turf is removed\" when each space in an area is owned and cared for by a responsible party. For example, for the projects \"high rise = high crime\", overall crime rate of high-rise neighborhoods in 1970s was double that of the low-rises with similar demographics, while crime within the inside public places (like corridors) seven times higher. According to the study, \"In a high‐rise, doubleloaded corridor apartment tower, the only defensible space is the interior of the apartment itself; everything else is a no man's land, neither public nor private ... Unlike the well‐peopled and continually surveyed public streets, these interior areas are sparsely used and impossible to survey; they become a nether world of fear and crime.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNewman started his academic career as the assistant professor at the Nova Scotia Technical College in Halifax (1961–1963), followed by a brief period at the University of Montreal (1963–1964) and moved on to the Washington University in St. Louis, where he started his work on defensible space principles of architecture as an associate professor of architecture, leaving university for New York in 1968, four years prior to publication of his main work, \"Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space\". He was then an associate professor of architecture at the Columbia University in 1968-1970 and associate professor of city planning at the New York University (1970–73).\nNewman had founded his own New York City-based company, Oscar Newman and Associates, for architecture and city planning, in 1968, and was a president of the Institute for Community Design Analysis since 1972.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPer the Writer's Directory 2008 (excluding fiction):\n\nDefensible Space, 1972\nArchitectural Design for Crime Prevention, 1973\nDesign Guidelines for Achieving Defensible Space, 1976\nCommunity of Interest, 1980\nReview and Analysis of the Chicago Housing Authority, 1982\nLong Term Housing Plan for the City of Yonkers, 1987\nPlan for District 7 of the City of Plantation, 1989\nImproving the Viability of Two Dayton Communities, 1992\nAnalysis of Sites in Nine CCP Cities, 1994\nCreating Defensible Space, 1996\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMan of Year, Law Enforcement News, 1995\nAchievement award, Environmental Design Research Conference, 1997\nAnnual Award of Achievement, Environmental Design Research Association, 1998\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nNewman, Oscar (2017-02-20). \"Defensible Space as a Crime Preventive Measure\".

        "content": "At 264 meters, the Lousberg is a prominent elevation on the northern edge of the historic center of Aachen, which was laid out as a forest and mountain park at the beginning of the 19th century according to plans by Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe. The origin of the name is not entirely clear. It could come from lousen (\"to look\"), since the mountain offers an excellent panoramic view, or it could be traced back to Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne. Another explanation has to do with the Aachen dialect term lous, which means \"clever\".\n\n\n== Geology, formation ==\nGeologically, the Lousberg is one of Aachen's three witness mountains, along with the Salvatorberg and the Wingertsberg, and one of the southernmost foothills of the Aachen-Limburg Cretaceous. It was formed during the Upper Cretaceous, when the region around Aachen was affected by a Europe-wide marine transgression, during which initially sandy and later predominantly calcareous sediments were deposited (Aachen Formation). The morphological elevation of the Lousberg is related to the tectonic movements that led to the formation of the Lower Rhine Bight.\nAt the foot of the Lousberg, dark gray, clayey to sandy sediments of the so-called Hergenrath layers were deposited, which formed in a swampy river delta. Silicified wood, charcoal, and numerous concretions of marcasite are embedded in these layers. Due to the water-storing properties of the deposits, the clay of the Hergenrath layers forms the most important spring horizon in the region, both on the Lousberg and in the Aachen Forest.\nSubsequently, during the Upper Cretaceous, the area was gradually submerged by the sea, and 30–50 m thick quartz sands of the Aachen Formation were deposited, which were mined in small sand pits on the lower slopes of the Lousberg (e.g. at the present playground at the end of Kupfer Street). There is a clear erosional unconformity between the sands of the Aachen Formation and the younger Vaals Formation of the Campanian. The sands of the Vaals Formation are characterized by an increased occurrence of glauconite. Because of their greenish-brown weathering color, these beds were formerly known as the Vaals Green Sands.\nIn the Campanian, tectonic movements began to increase, which are associated with the sinking of the Lower Rhine Bight and led to the uplift of the Lousberg Floe. The Vijlen and Orsbach limestones were probably not primarily sedimented due to their high altitude.\nIt was not until the Maastrichtian that the Lousberg floe was submerged again due to a rise in sea level. Dead microorganisms were deposited in a calcareous mud, which today forms the so-called Vetschau limestone. The original thickness of the limestone layer on the Lousberg was about 6 meters. The upper 4.5 meters contained layers of brown flint, which were the subject of a Neolithic quarry. All but a small amount of the flint was quarried, and the unused limestone material was dumped on the surrounding slopes. Due to the poor consolidation of this debris, small landslides still occur today, as evidenced by the uprooted trees and cracks in the footpaths.\n\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\nFrom an ornithological point of view, the Lousberg is very rich in species, as studies carried out by the RWTH Aachen University have shown. The population of bats, amphibians, and reptiles is also remarkable. The amphibians find spawning waters in the Soers north of the Lousberg. There is a continuous yew forest on the plateau. In the former St. Raphael monastery park to the north, the listed Müschpark, there are extensive stands of wild daffodils.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Neolithic period, about 5,500 to 5,000 years ago, flint was mined and worked intensively on the Lousberg. This gray flint, easily recognizable by its characteristic chocolate-brown color zones, was used to make axes and other tools, most of which were polished on-site or brought to settlements as semi-finished products.\nThe striking coloration of the Lousberg flint makes it a suitable object for studying the distribution of axe blades. The 14C dates of the artifacts found in the Lousberg overburden indicate that the mine was in operation between 3500 and 3000 B.C. Calculations based on the volume of the overburden, the weight of the production waste, and the average weight of the axe blades suggest that about 300,000 axe blanks left the Lousberg. These axe blanks were distributed as far as Belgium (Thieusies, about 160 km by air), central Hesse (Büdingen, about 225 km by air), and eastern Westphalia (Neuenknick near Minden, about 280 km by air).\nThe Stone Age mining of flint has almost completely reclaimed the central plateau of the Lousberg, which originally consisted of a 6 m thick layer of calcareous limestone. The resulting dumps, up to 4.5 meters thick, are still visible today as a hilly landscape under the yew grove. Finished axes and flint flakes have been found in the area and on the steep slopes.\nDuring the Roman occupation, the limestone was used to build the thermal baths of Aachen, and in the Middle Ages, it was used in the construction of Barbarossa's Wall.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the Napoleonic geographer Jean Joseph Tranchot began the topographic survey of the Rhineland at the scale of 1:20,000, starting from a triangulation point on the Lousberg. On October 17, 1807, the French Ministry of War erected a bluestone obelisk in honor of Tranchot and his colleagues, based on a design by the engineering geographer Capitaine Boucher. The obelisk is a precisely measured central point that served as a starting point for astronomical observations and mapping in the region. From there, other points in the area were determined using the triangulation method, which eventually allowed the entire area to be mapped. When Napoleon was deposed on April 2, 1814, the monument was destroyed. On May 15, 1815, the obelisk was re-erected by order of the Prussian Baron Karl von Müffling, who continued the surveying work on behalf of the Kingdom of Prussia. The inscription praising Napoleon was replaced by the inscription that can still be read today. The damage to the edges of the stone was compensated by chamfering, which is untypical for an obelisk.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIt was at this time that the first landscape park in Europe, initiated by citizens (and not by princes), was created on the Lousberg. These efforts were closely linked to the embellishments ordered by Napoleon in 1804, which included the \"repair and embellishment of the baths\" and the creation of \"walks\" on the filled-in trenches of the outer city fortifications. The idea of planting the Lousberg is said to have originated in 1806 and to have been promoted by Johann Wilhelm Körfgen (1769–1829), secretary general of the prefecture of the département of Roer. The idea of a park on the Lousberg was combined with the idea of building a society house called the \"Belvédère\" on the southeastern slope of the mountain. To this end, several citizens, under the chairmanship of Körfgen, joined in a specially created corporation whose purpose was to promote tourism. While the public authorities had to provide the land for the project and carry out the planting work, it was up to the limited company to raise the funds to build the society house. The first plantings on the Lousberg were commissioned in 1807 by Alexandre de Lameth, the prefect of the département of Roer. The plans for the park, based on the principles of the English landscape garden, were drawn up by the court gardener Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe of Düsseldorf, who had also been commissioned by Lameth to submit plans for the redesign of the outer moats. The overall project was overseen by a \"Committee for Embellishments,\" established in 1807. The Lousberg, which had been more or less bare and used as a sheep pasture, was transformed into a wooded park with an extensive tree population by 1818. The society house was built between 1807 and 1810.\nIts dilapidation was complained about as early as 1818. In 1827-28 the building was renovated and enlarged under the direction of Adam Franz Friedrich Leydel. On August 29, 1836, the Society House burned down completely after a ball. In 1838 it was rebuilt in the neoclassical style according to Leydel's plans and later renovated and expanded according to Friedrich Joseph Ark's plans. Known as the Belvedere, it functioned as both a restaurant and a casino. It was a popular destination for walkers, along with other features such as the Tranchot Obelisk, a Monopteros on the site of today's revolving tower, and a small Chinese pagoda. The circular path, beginning at the site of today's bronze statues, through the recently restored beech avenue on the north slope, offered spa guests and citizens different views of the city and the surrounding countryside, until all the views converged at the obelisk. The course itself was also dramatically designed by Weyhe, with flat sections alternating with climbs of varying lengths.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nBetween 1803 and 1814, General Secretary Johann Wilhelm Körfgen had his Müsch estate, located on the northern flank of the Lousberg in the Soers, transformed into a ferme ornée according to Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe's plans for the Lousberg. In 1866, Weyhe's son Joseph Clemens Weyhe developed the 11-hectare park into today's Müsch Park.\nAt the end of the 19th century, according to the plans of Aachen's director of gardens Heinrich Grube, the park areas of the Lousberg were extended eastwards to include the areas of the Salvatorberg, so that a network of green spaces could be created with the city fortifications (northern parts of the ring of avenues) planned by Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe from 1807 and with today's municipal gardens designed by Peter Joseph Lenné in 1852.\nIn 1906, the city of Aachen rebuilt the Kersten Pavilion, a baroque building designed by the Aachen architect Johann Joseph Couven, on the Lousberg. The pavilion, which is about 100 years older than the Lousberg Park, was previously located in the city of Aachen at Annuntiatenbach 22-28 and was part of the city palace of the wealthy dye-works owner Nicolaus Mantels. To save the building from demolition, the city bought it and had it rebuilt on the Lousberg. The pavilion has been managed by the Lousberg Society since 2005 and is used for exhibitions and lectures.\nThe open-air stage on the Lousberg, which was built like a Greek theater on the hillside facing the city, failed not least because of the Aachen weather.\nDuring World War II, the Belvédère social house and other structures in the park were destroyed. The remains of the columns of the Belvédère can still be seen today and are colloquially known as the \"Aachen Acropolis\".\nThe Belvedere Water Tower was built in 1956 to provide water to the western neighborhoods. In the 1980s, however, more efficient pumps made this unnecessary, and in 1988 the tower ceased to function as a water tower altogether. After extensive renovations, it is now used primarily as an office building. For a long time, the top floor of the building housed a café. The café was known for its 360° panoramic view and the automatic movement of tables around the circular area using a slow conveyor belt. A restaurant has since opened in the same space.\n\nToday, the Lousberg is largely wooded and serves as a local recreation area. The extensive park of the former St. Raphael Monastery north of the Lousberg was integrated into the Lousberg Park in 2009. The Lousberg is also the site of the annual summer Lousberg Run and the open-air literature festival \"Reading Pleasure on the Lousberg\".\n\tPictures\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Legend ==\n\nThe Lousberg legend, one of the Aachen legends, explains the existence of the Lousberg as a single mountain in the middle of the Aachen basin in an etiological way.\nAccording to the Aachen Cathedral legend, the people of Aachen tricked the devil into building the cathedral. The devil was out for revenge and wanted to bury the cathedral and the city in the sand forever. However, he was tricked by a poor woman and dropped the pile of sand north of the city, creating a larger and smaller mountain.\nBecause the woman was \"lous\", which means \"clever\" in the Aachen dialect, the larger mountain was called \"Lousberg\".\nThe legend is commemorated by a group of bronze statues on the Lousberg, depicting a farmer's wife and a devil, created in 1985 by Aachen artist Krista Löneke-Kemmerling.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEntry for Waldpark Lousberg in the European Garden Network EGHN in the database \"KuLaDig\" of the Rhineland Regional Association\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nResi Hellemann: Die Lousberg-Sage, in: Richard Wollgarten et al.: Aachener Sagen und Märchen, Oecher Platt Association (ed.), Aachen\nLucrezia Hartmann: Der Aachener Lousbergpark im 19.

Initially branded as Kennards Mini Storage it was renamed Easi-Stor in 1979.In 1981 a derelict wool store building in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane was purchased and redeveloped as Queensland’s first self storage centre. Nine further properties were subsequently purchased in Sydney, Newcastle and Brisbane during the 1980s.In 1991, the Kennard family, decided to split the business, with Neville Kennard taking the self storage business. At the same time it was renamed Kennards Self Storage. A further 14 storage centres opened in the 1990s including the first in Victoria.In the early the first of 15 wine storage locations opened. In a 50:60 joint venture with Valad Property Group, in 2004 24 self storage properties were purchased from Millers Self Storage.In 2007 eight facilities were purchased in New Zealand. In November 2010, Kennards bought out Valad Property Group shareholding in the joint venture. By 2023 101 facilities were operated.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sings Some Ol' Songs is a 2002 studio album by American singer-songwriter Victoria Williams. It has received positive reviews from critics and as of 2024, it is her last new music.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 3 out of 5 stars, with critic MacKenzie Wilson writing that \"Victoria Williams is a storyteller of her own kind who possesses a matchless whimsicality\" and in these covers \"Williams' peculiar vocal beauty comes alive\" with a collection that is \"absolutely lovely\". An assessment in Billboard called this release \"a fun treat for classic song lovers looking for new takes on old favorites\" and \"an interesting project overall that transports listeners to a simpler time\". In No Depression, a review called this \"a charming, fun, touching, old-fashioned record, the perfect soundtrack to when you’re feeling both full of life and melancholy\". At PopMatters, Jason McNeil called this work \"not the stellar album one might expect from this gifted singer-songwriter, although a definite keeper\".In a review of Williams' career for Trouser Press by Ira Robins, Wif Stenger, and Floyd Eberhard, the publication states that this album improves on Williams' last release Water to Drink and characterizes it as \"an agreeable spin for those whose taste runs to Norah Jones or Katharine Whalen\". In Uncut, Sings Some Ol' Songs received 3 out of 5 stars for being \"a romantic, star-canopied waltz through a cluster of timeless classics wrung from the rose-tinted golden dawn of Broadway and beyond\" and Williams displaying an \"awkward grace proves irresistible\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Moon River\" (music: Henry Mancini, lyrics: Johnny Mercer) – 3:18\n\"Blue Skies\" (Irving Berlin) – 2:23\n\"And Roses and Roses\" (Dorival Caymmi and Ray Gilbert) – 2:30\n\"Over the Rainbow\" (music: Harold Arlen, lyrics: E.

        "content": "This Moment: In Toronto with the Loose Band is a 1995 live album by American singer-songwriter Victoria Williams. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 3 out of 5 stars, with critic Lindsay Planer writing that \"This Moment is a precious and rare gift from a flower to her audience\" and the album has \"animated\" versions of songs from Williams' three studio albums. Chris Molanphy of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote that \"it's a joy to hear a show where audience and performer merge without cues\" and continued that Williams \"hugs these songs with her plaintive croon and infectious grace\". A brief review in Entertainment Weekly opined \"so what if this here butterfly often tips the sugar scales?\" and rated these \"16 sweet, subtle tales of dirt-road despair\" a B. An evaluation in No Depression called out how the \"instrumentation is beautiful\" and speculated that this release is unlikely to win Williams new fans, but will satisfy her existing listeners. In a review of Williams' career for Trouser Press by Ira Robins, Wif Stenger, and Floyd Eberhard, the publication states that \"the piano-based chamber-pop arrangements reach rarefied Joni Mitchell levels, and the album tilts dangerously toward the preciousness Williams’ best studio work (and guitar-based concerts) so easily resists\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Victoria Williams, except where noted.\n\n\"This Moment\" (Mike Heron and Williams) – 3:51\n\"Graveyard\" – 3:59\n\"Harry Went to Heaven\" – 3:19\n\"Waterfall\" – 3:21\n\"Polish Those Shoes\" – 5:53\n\"TC\" – 4:42\n\"Frying Pan\" – 3:15\n\"Hitchhikers Smile\" – 4:58\n\"Crazy Mary\" – 6:31\n\"Lights\" – 2:29\n\"Summer of Drugs\" – 5:39\n\"Imagination\" (Johnny Burke and James Van Heusen) – 3:22\n\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" (Otto Harbach and Jerome Kern) – 3:21\n\"Can’t Cry Hard Enough\" (Marvin Etzioni and David Williams) – 4:41\n\"Sunshine Country\" – 4:52\n\"Love\" – 4:47\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nVictoria Williams and The Loose Band\n\nJoey Burns – upright bass\nDan Heffington – drums\nDavid Manfield – acoustic guitar, violin, pedal steel guitar\nTim Ray – piano\nAndrew Williams – acoustic guitar\nDavid Williams – vocals\nVictoria Williams – electric guitar, vocals\nAdditional personnel\n\nTodd Fraracci – recording\nDanny Greenspoon – production\nCory Hambleton – production assistance\nTom Herbers – remixing at Paisley Park Studios, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States; digital editing at Wild Audio, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States; sequencing at Wild Audio, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States\nShane T.

In a review of Williams' career for Trouser Press by Ira Robins, Wif Stenger, and Floyd Eberhard, the publication blames producers Anton Fier and Stephen Soles for \"burying Williams and her eccentric voice in a massive studio effort\", but praised the string arrangements by Van Dyke Parks.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Victoria Williams, except where noted.\n\n\"Shoes\" – 3:00\n\"Frying Pan\" – 3:34\n\"Merry Go Round\" – 4:26\n\"Happy\" – 0:58\n\"TC\" – 3:57\n\"I’ll Do His Will\" (James Cleveland) – 5:09\n\"Big Fish\" – 3:36\n\"Animal Wild\" – 3:01\n\"Main Road\" – 3:02\n\"Lights\" – 1:45\n\"Opelousas\" – 2:55\n\"Statue of a Bum\" – 4:43\n\"Poetry\" – 1:17\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nHappy Come Home was difficult to market and by 1997, it had only sold 14,000 units and did not chart on any Billboard charts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of 1987 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHappy Come Home at Discogs (list of releases) \nHappy Come Home at MusicBrainz (list of releases)",

        "content": "Marey case is the name given to the trial for the 1983 kidnapping of Segundo Marey—one of the first victims of the Spanish government's dirty war against ETA—carried out by the so-called Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL).\n\n\n== The kidnapping of Segundo Marey ==\nOn 4 December 1983, mercenaries Mohand Talbi, Jean-Pierre Échalier, and Pedro Sánchez—who had been hired with fondos reservados from the Ministry of the Interior—kidnapped Segundo Marey from his home in Hendaye, mistaking him for alleged ETA leader Mikel Lujua. Segundo Marey, who was born in 1932 and died in 2001, had no ties to ETA. He was a 51-year-old office furniture salesman, son of a socialist who had been exiled to France in 1936.\nAt the time of the kidnapping, both Marey and his wife were sprayed with tear gas and beaten. Marey was taken by car to the town of Dantxarinea, in the province of Navarre, where a group of police officers under the orders of Deputy Commissioner José Amedo was waiting. The officers took him to a cabin in the village of Matienzo, in the province of Cantabria, where he remained locked up for ten days, with his head covered with a hood, until he was released in French territory, three kilometers from the Dantxarinea border crossing.\nThe goal of the kidnappers was to exert pressure on the French authorities to release police inspector Jesús Alfredo Gutiérrez Argüelles and three police officers of the Grupo Especial de Operaciones (GEO), who had been arrested in the French commune of Pau on 18 October 1983. When they were arrested, they had been trying to kidnap alleged ETA member José María Larretxea in an attempt to obtain information on the whereabouts of Army Captain Alberto Martín Barrios, who had been kidnapped himself by ETA and later murdered. Finally, the then police inspector of Bilbao, Francisco Álvarez Sánchez, obtained the release of the four detainees with the agreement that they would appear before the French judicial authorities when summoned. However, this was not the case and thus they were sentenced in absentia.\nThe Antiterrorist Liberation Groups (GAL)—an organization that had remained unknown until then—claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of Segundo Marey in a communiqué written in French that was found in one of his pockets. The GAL accused the French government of allowing ETA members to stay in the French Basque Country and threatened to retaliate for each murder by the terrorists.\n\n\n== Arrest of the mercenaries ==\nBarely an hour after Marey's kidnapping, Pedro Sánchez, a former corporal of the French Foreign Legion, was arrested as a suspect. Mohand Talbi, accused like Sánchez of the kidnapping, was arrested and imprisoned in October 1984. Talbi was tried with Jean-Pierre Échalier in December 1987 and both were sentenced to thirteen years in prison. But Sánchez, the head of the command, was not tried as he had died of pancreatic cancer in a Bordeaux prison in December 1986 because, according to Talbi, he had been poisoned. In March 1989, the Court of Appeal of Paris reduced Talbi's sentence to nine years.\n\n\n== Sentence against Amedo and investigation of the Marey case ==\nIn April 1987, mercenaries José Paulo Figueiredo Fontes, Rogerio Carvalho da Silva, Mario Correia da Cunha, and Antonio Jorge Ferreira Cisneros, who were on trial in Lisbon, claimed to have been hired by Spanish Deputy Commissioner José Amedo to attack ETA members in the south of France. In January 1988, the Criminal Court of the Audiencia Nacional of Spain found criminal evidence in Amedo's actions. His trips to Portugal in 1986, in which he hired those mercenaries, were of an official nature and paid with fondos reservados from the Ministry of the Interior, according to the investigations carried out by Judge Baltasar Garzón. On 20 September 1991, police officers José Amedo and Michel Domínguez were sentenced to 108 years in prison for six counts of attempted murder, in which they participated as perpetrators by incitement. In October 1994, Judge Garzón reopened the investigation into the kidnapping of Segundo Marey after Amedo and Domínguez implicated several police commanders and high-ranking officials of the Ministry of the Interior in the actions of the GAL for which they had been convicted.\n\n\n== Sentence against high-ranking officials of the Ministry of the Interior ==\nOn 29 July 1998, the Supreme Court of Spain sentenced former Minister of the Interior José Barrionuevo, former Director General of State Security Rafael Vera, and former Civil Governor of Biscay Julián Sancristóbal to ten years in prison; former police commissioners Francisco Álvarez Sánchez, Miguel Planchuelo, and José Amedo to nine years and six months; former secretary general of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in Biscay Ricardo García Damborenea, to seven years; former police officers Julio Hierro and Francisco Saiz Ojeda, to five years and six months; former agents José Ramón Corujo and Luis Hens, to five years; and former police officer Michel Domínguez, to two years and four months. Likewise, they were ordered to pay Marey 30 million pesetas in damages.\nThey were sentenced for organizing and financing the kidnapping of Segundo Marey, with the aggravating circumstance that, when they learned that he was not a member of ETA, they prolonged his imprisonment by threatening to kill him if the French authorities did not release the four Spanish police officers who had been arrested while trying to kidnap a presumed member of ETA. The sentence also confirmed that both Barrionuevo and Vera encouraged and financed the actions of the GAL, due to being its highest-ranking officials. Their imprisonment did not take place  until September and, just three months later, Barrionuevo and Vera were released thanks to a partial pardon by the administration of José María Aznar.\nOn 17 March 2001, the Constitutional Court upheld the Supreme Court's ruling and dismissed the appeals that had been filed. Likewise, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in January 2010 that the conviction had been fair. The ruling admitted that the investigation of the case by Judge Baltasar Garzón was not carried out in an impartial manner, but stated that this problem was subsequently corrected by the Supreme Court because it carried out a new preliminary investigation by Judge Eduardo Móner.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGAL (paramilitary group)\nETA (separatist group)\nBasque conflict\nCorruption in Spain\nGovernments of José María Aznar\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTimeline of the Marey case, a report by El Mundo on 1 June 2001",

He was a partner in the trading company Ajum Goolam Hossen and Co., which was owned by his father Ajum. Piperdy served as a municipal councilor, making him one of the earliest Muslim representatives in local government in Mauritius.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCassam Ajum Piperdy was born around 1882 in Port Louis, Mauritius. He was the second eldest son of Ajum Goolam Hossen, following his brother Ahmed Ajum Piperdy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCassam Ajum Piperdy became a partner in the trading company Ajum Goolam Hossen and Co. in 1900 until its dissolution in 1901. The company, founded by his father Ajum, was a prominent player in Mauritius' commercial landscape at the time.\nPiperdy became the second-ever Muslim municipal councillor elected in Mauritius, serving alongside his brother Ahmed. At the time, few Muslims held municipal councillor positions. Dr. Hassen Sakir was the first Muslim municipal councillor of Mauritius, and Piperdy followed suit soon after.\nIn 1901, when Mahatma Gandhi visited Mauritius, Cassam and his father Ajum hosted Gandhi and his family, along with 200 other guests, at a building on Bourbon Street. Cassam, along with Rasool Hossen Ellam and Munshi Abdool Cadir, delivered the welcome speech during Gandhi's visit.\nIn 1922, Cassam Ajum Piperdy, along with Maleck Rassool Moorad, served as liquidators for Ajum Goolam Hossen and Co. after its dissolution.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCassam Ajum Piperdy derived his surname from his father's firm in Rander, Piperdy, which originated from the word Latin \"piper,\" as the Piperdys of Rander were known for selling pepper and other spices.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCassam died in the mid 20th century in Port Louis, Mauritius.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMemon people\nSunni Bohra\nGujarati Muslims\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The National Party \"Fatherland\" (Polish: Stronnictwo Narodowe „Ojczyzna”, SNO or SN„O”) was an political party in Poland was formed in March 1992 as a result of a split in the National Party (1989) (so-called \"senior party\"). The party leaders were Bogusław Rybicki and Bogusław Jeznach. The newspaper of the party was the weekly magazine \"Ojczyzna\". National Party \"Fatherland\" pursued a coalition with left-wing populist and nationalist parties such as the Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, but was unsuccessful in doing so. The party participated in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, creating an electoral committee Fatherland - Polish List. However, it failed to win any seats, earning 15.958 votes, which amounted to 0,12% of the popular vote. The party rapidly declined after 1993, and in 1996 it dissolved to join a right-wing National Democratic Party.\nSN \"Ojczyzna\" represented the left wing of the national camp (known as \"pink endecja\"), proclaiming a populist socio-economic programme. It distanced itself from the right and ignored cultural issues, going as far as mocking the Polish right for being out of touch with the problems of common people, stating that Polish right-wing parties prefer \"magic incantations about Jews\" and \"haunted conspiracy theories\" to addressing the poverty and suffering of ordinary people. The party was anti-capitalist and strongly attacked liberalization and privatization measures, especially the neoliberal Balcerowicz Plan that introduced capitalist free-market economy to Poland. The party called neoliberalism \"economic genocide\". It also criticized social-democratic models of capitalism as insufficient, arguing that they would nevertheless lead to the situation where \"the rich control the state\".\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Polish Round Table Agreement and end of the communist period in Poland, Polish nationalist circled united to form National Party (Polish: Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) in 1989, which was a reactivation of an interwar national conservative party of the same name - National Party. The party was then formally registered in 1990 and restarted political activities. In the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, National Party won 74.082 votes equating to 0.66% of the popular vote. Shortly after the 1991 election, the party grew divided as notable factions and tendencies formed within it.\nAmongst the growing sectionalism, two 'tendencies' were particularly notable - the \"blue\" faction and the \"pink\" faction. The blue camp represented the traditional right and aspired to closely mimic the pre-war National Party, including supporting fully capitalist liberalism economy and rejecting the Polish communist period. In contrast, the 'pink camp' was considered a left-wing deviation, criticizing the blue party's line as being elitist and too clerical. The pink faction sought to focus on socio-economic issues and advocated state-owned economy, together with an expansive welfare state. In February, Bogusław Rybicki, the leader of the pink faction, was expelled from the National Party, after being accused of being a communist civil servant. Several other activists of the party left the party in solidarity with Rybacki, and on 28 March 1992, they found National Party \"Fatherland\", which was to be a left-wing equivalent of the National Party.\nThe party held its national convention in Warsaw, where Bogusław Rybicki and Bogusław Jeznach were elected as the leaders of the party. By 1993, the party's organisational network already covered 42 provinces. The number of Ojczyzna members was around 2100 at the time. The circulation of the party's newspaper, the weekly Ojczyzna - rose from 3,500 to 6,000 copies within a year. The party started holding events, consisting mainly of anniversary celebrations, but also street protests and paramilitary training.\nThe party sought to run in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election. The party hold talks with Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Polish: Samoobrona Rzeczpospolitej Polskiej, commonly referred to as Samoobrona) in hopes of organizing an electoral coalition. Samoobrona was a far-left party; it became popular through its radical and aggressive agrarian protests, forming a paramilitary group \"Peasant Battalions\" (Polish: Bataliony Chłopskie), referring to a Polish agrarian WW2-era resistance movement of the same name, which protected farmers against bailiffs, evictions and police.\nSamoobrona and its radical leader, Andrzej Lepper, gained widespread attention through controversial statements such as \"We are a radical party, open to all disadvantaged people who are starving at home.\" and \"If someone has a billion or two or ten, they really couldn't have made it through legal work\" became widely reported and known.\" It had an unclear ideological profile - Polish political scientist Jarosław Tomasiewicz described it as a \"radical-populist\" party combined agrarianism, nationalism and \"Soviet-style\" communism.\nIdiosyncratic views of Samoobrona, combined with their populism, left-wing nationalism and radicalism, were appealing to the National Party \"Fatherland\", which represented a left-wing splinter from a right-wing, radically nationalist party. Despite Rybicki's efforts, Samoobrona rejected the idea of cooperating with his National Party. Samoobrona would later drift further left and cooperate with more clearly left-wing parties through Social Alliance.\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt to form a coalition with Samoobrona, the party decided to run in the election on its own, but open itself to cooperation with independent candidates and minor organizations through creating Fatherland - Polish List. This also allowed the party to distance itself from the 'main' National Party, which the party members considered too radical, especially in the wake of its 1991 electoral performance. Fatherland - Polist List was formally registered on 30 June 1993. It was located in Warsaw. However, the electoral bloc was undermined by the creation of Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" (Polish: Katolicki Komitet Wyborczy \"Ojczyzna\", KKW) in July. The KKW was led by National-Catholic Christian National Union and was a coalition of Christian-democratic and political-Catholic parties. It was largely based on the Catholic Electoral Action, a coalition from the 1991 Polish parliamentary election with similar program and purpose.\nHowever, unlike the Catholic Electoral Action, which was staunchly right-wing and National-Catholic, the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" sought to present itself as a moderate party and build a broad coalition of both churchgoing and moderate Catholics. The committee sought an official endorsement from the Polish Catholic Church, but the Church strongly emphasized its neutrality, a decision influenced by the controversy caused by the clergy's alleged support for the Catholic Electoral Action in 1991. In light of this, the KKW organized through parish councils instead.\nThe Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" not only had an almost identical name to Fatherland - Polish List. National Party \"Fatherland\" and its allies strongly protested the \"theft\" of its committee and filed a lawsuit against the Catholic committee, but they were unable to hamper the KKW. Ultimately, Fatherland - Polish List performed terribly in the 1993 election, receiving only 15.958 votes, which equated 0.12% of the popular vote.\nAfter its disappointing performance in the 1993 election, the party started rapidly declining. The party leadership attempted to revive the party by presenting itself as \"revisionist-nationalist\" party, hoping to recruit new members and develop an attractive ideological life. The Unification Congress of National Organisations was held in April 1994, where a couple of tiny political groupings joined the National Party \"Fatherland\". However, despite the merger, the paty kept declining - members withdrew from party activity or deserted to other groupings, including Samoobrona.\nIn 1995, Bogusław Rybicki launched his campaign for the 1995 Polish presidential election, running on a protectionism, isolationist and anti-privatization platform. However, he withdrew his candidacy before the election.\nThere was also a clear decline in activity. There were only sporadic pickets; the most important manifestation of the party's activity was the lectures delivered in the field by Rybicki. National Party \"Fatherland\" was still looking for support in Andrzej Lepper and his Samoobrona, but Rybicki party was not an attractive partner for Lepper, especially as Samoobrona steadily moved towards a direction of becoming a 'stabilized' left-wing party. Samoobrona eschwed its vague position in favour of developing a clearly defined far-left ideology -  Lepper called for a \"worker-peasant alliance\" and increasingly marginalized and dismissed the nationalist wing of the party. By late 1990s, Lepper also called for return to socialism arguing that it had \"not yet reached full maturity\".\nIsolated, Rybicki decided that the National Party \"Fatherland\" is no longer able to function on its own and pursed rapprochement with the National Democratic Party (the grouping representing the 'right' wing in the national camp). As agreed in November 1996, \"Fatherland\" was to enter the SND. This meant de facto capitulation for Rybicki, as he had to accept not only the statute, but also his partner's alien program line; the only success was the agreement that the leaders of Ojczyzna would be co-opted into the authorities of the united party. The congress of SN Ojczyzna on 15 December 1996 decided to self-dissolve.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe National Party \"Fatherland\" had a seemingly conflicting ideology, stating commitment to the (principially right-wing) National Democracy as envisioned by Roman Dmowski on one hand, and advocating anti-capitalism and left-wing, inclusive nationalism on the other hand. In its program however, the party made it clear that it strongly deviated from Dmowski's definition of 'National Democracy', which National Party \"Fatherland\" defined as the primacy of national interest, guidance of moral principles based on Catholic social teaching, and egalitarianism. In a complete opposite to ethnic nationalism of Dmowski, the party envisioned minority protection and special provisions that would reserve Sejm seats for ethnic and religious minorities proportional to their share of the population.\nThe party also greatly deviated from other \"national-democratic\" groupings through its focus. In case of SN„O”, nationalist rhetoric was very sparsely used and was mostly limited to the party's slogan \"Be proud to be Polish\". The party did not speak on cultural issues, and instead greatly focused on economic matters, which the \"senioral party\" was neglectful on. Here, the National Party \"Fatherland\" was consistently left-populist and attacked right-wing parties for promoting rhetoric that is completely detached from the life of an average Pole. In its program for Fatherland - Polish List, the party noted:\n\nWhat effect can be produced by constantly talking and writing about the Jews? These are magic incantations. On the other hand, such rhetoric frightens away millions of ordinary people whose main problem is how to make ends meet. The national programme must therefore be first and foremost a programme for normal Poles, not for the haunted trackers of various conspiracies. (...) The leadership of the ZChN extends its right-wing hatred and dogma of anti-communism to the entire economic matter, i.e. walls, machines, and God-fearing workers.\nNational Party \"Fatherland\" promoted the view of the superiority of labour over capital and adopted left-wing slogans, such as supporting workers' strikes and trade unions. At the same time, the party argued that their views are rooted less in socialism and more in Catholic social teaching, although the party did not reject socialism outright. The party argued that economic actions must be assessed from the point of view of Catholic morality, as well as their on \"the interests of the nation\". The party spoke of \"four dimensions\" of economy - 'purely economic', social, national-political and 'religious-behavioural'. The party was very close to left-wing parties in its view that economic impacts must be analyzed from the perspective of social consequences.\nThe program of the party heavily spoke of Balcerowicz Plan, a neoliberal plan carried out by Leszek Balcerowicz that dismantled the socialist economy in Poland in favour of a capitalist free-market economy, with harsh deregulation, privatization and austerity measures. National Party \"Fatherland\" decried the plan as \"economic genocide\", pointing out that the plan resulted in full price liberalization together with monopolization of privatized industries, resulting in 'chronic cost inflation'. In regards to tariff liberalisation, the party decried the subsequent \"collapse of Polish entrepreneurship and agriculture, unemployment, a budget meltdown and an outflow of foreign currency\". According to its program, Balcerowicz Plan sold Polish industries to the wealthy few and large international companies, resulting in a \"loss of economic sovereignty\". The party also accused left-wing parties of failing to challenge the capitalist transition, writing that \"The SLD-PSL coalition has run amok on privatisation\".\nAccording to the party, the capitalist transition had not only had negative effects at the macroeconomic level, but has also affected ordinary people. Here the party cited Archbishop Ignacy Tokarczuk, who stated that the burden of the transformation has been placed on the poor. Pensioners grew poorer, and the value of pensions has fallen sharply. The party also mentioned the farmers, who were pushed to the margins of society, arguing that the country has been \"completely devastated by less than 5 years of transition\". The party noted that all ordinary Poles had suffered from the capitalist transition, as they \"have nowhere to live and no money to buy the most necessary products\". The National Party \"Fatherland\" claimed that this was the intentional outcome of the plan, as \"It is easy to govern a nation that is starving\".\nThe party also held staunchly anti-capitalist views, arguing that capitalism as a system inevitably results in development of nomenklatura and 'stratification of society' where \"the rich control the state\". Polish political scientist pl:Jarosław Tomasiewicz notes Marxist undertones in the party's program, as the party reiterated Marxist thesis that the state is an instrument of the ruling class. National Party \"Fatherland\" in fact had contacts with Marxist economists such as Józef Balcerek, who was invited to write articles on behalf of the party for its weekly \"Ojczyzna\". The party also rejected the idea of \"people's capitalism\" which it defined as capitalism that aims to be based on social justice, such as social-democratic models. According to the party, any improvement coming from such models would be \"microscopic\" and temporary, and would in the long run fail to prevent consolidation of power by wealthy groups, along with 'social divisions'.\nThe consequences of capitalism were also criticized from the point of foreign takeover. Party activists argued that the transition was carried out to benefit foreign capital, concluding that Balcerowicz Plan was \"economic aggression\" against Poland. Marxist economist Józef Balcerek, writing for the party, wrote: \"The main beneficiary of privatization will be foreign corporations, especially German ones. This will be the final blow to Polish industry in line with the will of the global financial oligarchy.\" The leader of the party, Rybicki, likewise wrote: \"Privatisation is to make Poland a defenceless economic desert on which Western capital will expand.\" The party argued that capitalism \"aims, step by step, to deprive Poles of their own economy\".\nDespite avoiding cultural issues, the party spoke on religion, arguing that \"the Polish state must also be Catholic\". In its program, the party wrote: \"The [Catholic] Church should have its rightful place in public life. The state should not be indifferent or even less unfriendly towards the Church\". Leader of the party, Rybicki, wrote that the party's vision includes \"granting the Catholic Church, as an absolute majority, special rights and privileges\". Commenting on the party's program, Tomasiewicz wrote that \"the National Party \"Fatherland\", combining Catholic nationalism with a 'socialist' economic programme, appears to be a continuation of the National Workers' Party rather than the classic National Democracy.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "British overseas cities on British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are remaining key places of the former far-reaching British Empire, which was a vast holding of many regions, countries, protectorates and territories. A number of notable settlements within England and constituent countries of the grouping from the medieval period onwards were granted city status by British monarchs. This is a honorific title only which grants no additional civic privileges, but it could confer a sense of increased local pride, additional prestige along with international notability and recognition to an area.\nPrimarily from the 20th century many territories gained independence, and this caused a reduction in the number of cities remaining within the Empire. These overseas lands did not form part of the modern United Kingdom except for Ireland, and later Northern Ireland. Today, the British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies remain outside the UK, but the power to designate cities continues to be vested ultimately with the UK government and the present sovereign Charles III, who is also the head of state for these lands. There are (as of 2022) presently four cities in the Overseas Territories, and one on a Crown Dependency.\n\n\n== Current overseas cities ==\n\n\n=== Map of cities in Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies ===\n\n\n== History ==\nBritish Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies cities began as settlements in foreign lands controlled by England during medieval times from the 12th century as English overseas possessions, later from 1707 after union with Scotland becoming termed as the British Empire comprising Crown Colonies, which after a reduction of these due to countries being granted independence, became known as the British Dependent Territories, and this further evolved into the present British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. As these sometimes far-flung lands became established, locals and British settlers from the most notable settlements began to request privileges as a validation of their importance, and city status was one of the more dignified honours handed out to a select few communities, other title types including becoming a borough.\nIn England where city status began, a number of settlements which contained a cathedral initially were regarded as important places, especially after the Norman Invasion, with Norman leaders requesting that bishops base these within a recognisable location closer to the population. Later on, many of these notable towns were formally given city status using a legal instrument such as a city charter and later using letters patent. Certain overseas territories such Ireland began to follow this trend until the later 1800s, after which the designation became disassociated to cathedrals and other merits came into play, such as population size.\n\n\n=== Ireland and Northern Ireland ===\n\nThe first English overseas expansion occurred as early as 1169, when the Norman invasion of Ireland began to establish English possessions in Ireland, with it initially styled as a lordship and later a dependent kingdom, before full union with the UK in 1800. City status there tended historically to be granted by royal charter. The criteria depended less on the presence of a cathedral, and there are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that have never been called cities. In 1923 Ireland was partitioned and became an independent state; Northern Ireland continues to be a part of the UK.\n\n\n=== France ===\n\nPrior to the commune status that cities in France presently hold, in medieval times French Normans from the House of Normandy, English Angevin and Plantagenet kings held large swathes of territory such as the Duchy of Normandy as part of the wider Angevin Empire for which the ownership was continually disputed and culminated in the Hundred Years War. Normandy was held until 1204 but forfeited to French kings, and remaining French land was held with them being feudal tenants-in-chief, so any control of city privileges continued to lay with French nobility and monarchs.\nDuring the period a number of towns were given charters with varying levels of self-government and status. The grant of city status was much like England, generally based on cathedral status. This was sometimes confirmed by the use of city seals which were not necessarily connected to the presence of a church, although France was one of the more highly populated European countries of the period and had many cathedrals, by which more heavily inhabited areas were more likely to be given privileges.\n\n\n=== Crown colonies and British overseas expansion ===\nAs the English empire expanded into the New World and parts of the old at the end of the medieval age, there were calls from these early communities for self-governance and charters were issued occasionally, sometimes by local governors which were ratified by monarchs. Unlike England, these early grants did not depend on the settlement having an ecclesiastical centre. Although many settlements had begun to build churches, the Church of England had not begun to create overseas dioceses until 1787, and the Colonial Office were given the power to declare cities in Crown colonies by letters patent when appointing bishops after a cathedral had been established. The first overseas place in this period to have a diocese in place (1793) and cathedral (1804) before a grant of city status (1832) was Quebec City, Canada. Later, Gibraltar, Jamestown, St Helena and several others were bestowed the status at the same time as the establishment of the diocese with diocesan letters patent instead of city status letters patent.\nHowever, after a number of court cases, from 1863 the Privy Council ruled that the Church of England did not have jurisdiction over overseas dioceses in many circumstances where those countries had been given self-government, and therefore deprecating this short-lived tradition of royal grant establishing bishop sees at the same time as granting city status in the Empire, causing concerns on the patents issued; Goulburn in Australia for example found itself declared a city twice - once by letters patent in 1863 and once by law in 1885 after doubts arose to its status. As core colonies obtained local legislatures and dominions formed responsible government administrations (primarily those in present-day Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa), they adapted the laws of settlement incorporation and city status to be based on measures such as size of population and local revenue. Sensing the wind of change, creation of cities in the UK continued to be based on post-creation of dioceses until 1888 when the practice was discontinued, and later cities in Britain and overseas places such as Hamilton, Bermuda were instead granted the status by petitioning monarchs via officials or on royal occasions such as jubilees.\n\n(brackets) contain former place names which the original grant may reference\n* a select number of notable cities granted the status by responsible government administrations (given the status by local legislature without royal prerogative) but prior to independence are indicated\n\n\n=== Post British Empire ===\nThe description of the remaining overseas lands were changed from colonies and 'dependencies of the crown' in 1983 to British Dependent Territories and later either British Overseas Territories from 2002 and Crown Dependencies. The last populated city of significance was Victoria, Hong Kong with its parent territory reverting to China in 1997, leaving relatively small resident populations in the remaining cities. Since the second Millennium, competitions have been arranged by the government to grant the status to UK settlements and this power remains delegated to it and the monarch. In 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories being allowed to take part for the first time. The applicants on the British Overseas Territories were George Town (in the Cayman Islands), Gibraltar, Stanley (in the Falkland Islands); of the Crown Dependencies these were Douglas and Peel (both in the Isle of Man).  It was later discovered that Gibraltar had been previously named a city, researchers at The National Archives confirming that Gibraltar's city status was still in effect, with the territory missing from the official list of cities for the past 140 years. Stanley and Douglas were later granted the honour, making a total of five cities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTerritorial evolution of the British Empire\nHistorical development of Church of England dioceses\nList of cities in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHallam, Elizabeth M; Everard, Judith (2001).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The siege of Mount Tabor was a military engagement between the Crusader armies of the Fifth Crusade and the Ayyubids. The combined Crusader armies laid siege to Mount Tabor, which was the objective of the Hungarian Crusade. The crusaders ultimately failed to capture the fort.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1215, Pope Innocent III held a council on November 1215 to declare a new crusade, calling to liberate the Christian prisoners and to capture the Muslim fortress at Mount Tabor. The Hungarian king, Andrew II, and the Austrian Duke, Leopold VI, answered the call and began assembling and equipping their armies. Both armies gathered in the Croatian city of Spalato. The Austrians first set sail and arrived in Acre, and 16 days later, the Hungarians arrived in late September 1217.\nLeopold invited Bohemond IV of Antioch and his vassals to join him, which he did. The king of Cyprus, Hugh I, arrived in Acre with a large number of Turcopoles. The Austrian and Hungarian armies, along with the King of Jerusalem, Cyprus, Antiochian troops, and the three military orders, launched an offensive to enhance the security of Acre.\nThey left on November 4 and explored the area around the Mount Tabor fortress. On November 10, they crossed the Jordan River close to the Sea of Galilee and headed north along the shore. They crossed Jacob's ford once more and made their way back to Acre. They had amassed a sizable amount of loot; they sacked Baisan and looted the city. They had also fulfilled their promise to make a pilgrimage, going to such sacred locations and taking a bath in Jordan.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nAfter a brief rest, the Crusader armies, without the king of Hungary, launched an attack against Mount Tabor. Led by King John of Brienne, they arrived there on November 30. The fortress at Mount Tabor consisted of 77 towers and had a garrison of 2,000 men, led by Badr al-Din Muhammad Al-Hakkari. Regarded by Muslims as unconquerable, only with the help of a local convert boy who knew a hidden path to the fort encouraged the Crusaders to attack it. On December 3, Sunday, the Crusaders climbed up the mountain during heavy fog. The Patriarch of Jerusalem led the way while the clergy sang and prayed. The Crusaders came so close to those walls that their lances could touch the walls; however, the Ayyubid garrison quickly became alerted to what was happening and launched a sortie that successfully pushed the Crusaders down the mountain, despite the bravery that King John showed during the fight.\nUpon their descent, King John held a council with the Master of Hospitallers and Bohemond, along with the Syrian Barons, who both had disputes regarding the continuation of the siege. Bohemond strongly advocated for abandoning the attack. On December 5, some of the Crusaders, including the Templars and Hospitallers, unsatisfied with the decision of their leaders, decided to launch another attack on the fortress. This time, they placed ladders against the walls; however, the Ayyubids counter-attacked using Greek fire and scattered the Crusaders with heavy losses. Disheartened by this failure, the Crusaders decided to abandon the siege, and on December 7, they withdrew from Mount Tabor and headed to Acre.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFew months later, the Muslims decided to give up the fortress. They destroyed the fort and left, thinking it would be worthless to defend in the long run.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLászló Veszprémy, The Crusade of Andrew II, King of Hungary, 1217–1218.[1]\nKenneth Setton, A History of the Crusades, Volume II: The Later Crusades, 1189–1311.[2]\nDavid Cook, Ibn Naẓīf's World-History, Al-Tā’rīkh Al-Manṣūrī.[3]\nR.

Since then many other authors printed collections of facetiae, in Latin, and later in other European languages.\n\n\n== Other notable collections ==\nFaceciae Polskie  abo Żartowne a trefne powieście biesiadne ... teraz znowu poprawione i przydano (Polish Faceciae, Or...)\nFacetiae facetiarum, hoc est joco-seriorum fasciculus novus\nIt contains a number of facetious parodies of scientific and philosophical treatises: Delineatio Summorum Capitum Lustitudinis studenticae In Nonnullis Academiis ufitata, p.1.

        "content": "HAT-P-38, formally named Horna, is a star located in the northern constellation Triangulum. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.51, making it readily visible in amateur telescopes but not to the naked eye. The object is located relatively far at a distance of 821 light-years based on Gaia DR3 parallax measurements, but it is drifting closer with a spectroscopic radial velocity of −19.85 km/s. \nHAT-P-38 has a stellar classification of G5, indicating that it is a G-type star. It has 88.6% the mass of the Sun and 101% the radius of the Sun. It radiates 67.72% the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,330 K, giving it a yelllowish-orange hue. HAT-P-38 is slightly metal enriched with an iron abundance 115% that of the Sun's. It is estimated to be approximately 10.1 billion years old, which is more than twice the age of the Sun. It spins modestly with a projected rotational velocity of 0.4 km/s.\n\n\n== Planetary system ==\nIn 2012, a hot Saturn was detected on a tight 4-day orbit via the transit method; the planet has a similar mass and radius to Saturn. A 2017 paper comparing HAT-P-38b and WASP-67b found that there was water vapor in the planet's atmosphere. HAT-P-38b had a higher water vapor abundance compared to the latter, indicating that the planet is free of clouds or hazes in its upper atmosphere.\nIn 2019, the system was selected for the second NameExoWorlds campaign for Finland as part of the IAU's 100th anniversary. The approved name for the star is Horna, which is hell or the underworld from Finnic mythology..\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2019, it was selected for the second NameExoWorlds campaign for Finland as part of the IAU's 100th anniversary. The approved name for the planet is Hiisi, which represents sacred localities and later evil spirits from Finnic mythology. It shares this name with the binary companion of the trans-Neptunian object 47171 Lempo.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe transits of HAT-P-38 were first observed between August and November 2010 by using two telescopes related to the HATNet Project: The HAT-6 telescope in Arizona and the HAT-8 telescope in Hawaii. Astronomers observed a transit curve with a period of 4.64033 days. Later observations of the star's radial velocity using the High Dispersion Spectrograph confirmed HAT-P-38b's planetary status and it also yielded its mass in the process.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nHAT-P-38b is a hot Saturn that takes over 4 days to circle its host star in a relatively circular and tight orbit; it has a separation of 0.0519 astronomical units. HAT-P-38b has 26.6% the mass of Jupiter, which is similar to that of Saturn. However, tidal heating from HAT-P-38 causes the planet to bloat to 82.5% the radius of Jupiter. It has an equilibrium temperature of 1,082 K. The planet has a density of 590 kg/m3, which is half of that of water (the density of water is 1,000 kg/m3). The average gravitational acceleration of the planet is 9.77 m/s2, which is slightly smaller compared to the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth. \n\nIn 2017, the atmospheres of HAT-P-38b and WASP-67b were compared since both planets had similar properties. Giovanni Bruno and colleagues detected water vapor in both planets, with HAT-P-38b having the greater abundance in its atmosphere. This indicates that the atmosphere lacks clouds or hazes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sergio Lombardo (Rome, 1 December 1939) is an Italian artist known for his role in Typical Gestures series and the creation of Supercomponibili.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe began his artistic journey at a very young age, specifically at the end of the 1950s; creating his first monochrome works, pieces of paper glued on canvas and painted with enamel layers. He made his debut in a group exhibition in 1958 at the Premio Cinecittà in Rome, where he met Francesco Lo Savio, Mario Schifano, Renato Mambor, Cesare Tacchi, and Tano Festa.\nIn 1961, Lombardo began creating the Typical Gestures series, initially painting in black and white and later in color, in a size larger than real life, some of the most important political figures of the time, highlighting their emblematic and evocative characteristics. During this artistic period, he joined the Piazza del Popolo School group, an artistic movement that included artists such as Mario Schifano, Jannis Kounellis, Tano Festa, Franco Angeli, Renato Mambor, Cesare Tacchi, who gathered in Rome around Caffè Rosati and the La Tartaruga gallery of Plinio de Martiis. In 1963, he exhibited at La Tartaruga Gallery with Renato Mambor and Cesare Tacchi, while in 1964 he participated in the collective exhibition Eight young Roman painters.\nFrom the mid-sixties, he created the Supercomponibili series, which in 1968 he presented at the La Salita gallery in Rome and at the Salone Annunciata in Milan. These years marked a strong participation abroad in thematic reviews and group exhibitions, including in 1967 at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, in 1968 at the Jewish Museum in New York, and in 1969 at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\nIn 1970 at the 35th International Art Exhibition, the Venice Biennale he exhibited Sphere with Mermaid, an environmental work composed of seven spheres that emitted an alarm siren sound at the slightest movement.\nFrom the eighties, he developed Stochastic painting, automatic procedures of artistic creation. He exhibited in numerous shows including the solo exhibition in 2004 at the Mudima Foundation in Milan and in 2011 at the collective Italian Masterpieces a look at the twentieth century at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto. In the '80s, he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Frosinone.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRome Sixties, Silvana Editorial \n\"Sergio Lombardo\", Texts by Maurizio Calvesi, Miriam Mirolla, edited by Miriam Mirolla, April 5-May 6, 1995, Museum Laboratory of Contemporary Art, University of Rome \"La Sapienza\".\n\"Art of the Twentieth Century 1945-2001\", M.Mirolla, G.Zucconi, edited by R.Scrimieri, Mondadori University, Milan, 2001.\n\"Psychology and Art of the Event.

        "content": "Paiche Onyemaechi was a 25 year old Malawian woman whose decapitated remains were discovered in Piltown, Co. Kilkenny in 2004.[1] To date, her murder remains unsolved and her head has never been recovered.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPaiche Onyemaechi, born Paiche Unyolo, was born in Malawi. Her father is Leonard Unyolo, former Chief Justice of Malawi who was the incumbent Chief Justice at the time of her death.\nPaiche left Malawi to study in business administration in London before arriving in Ireland as an asylum seeker with her first husband. She married Nigerian-born Chika Onyemaechi in Waterford in 2003. Together they had two children. Paiche and Chika received Irish residency with the birth of their first child.\nPrior to her death, Paiche had worked at lap dancing clubs in Limerick and Dublin and had previously worked as a prostitute.\nAt the time of her death, she was living in St Herblain Park in Waterford city.\n\n\n== Death ==\nPaiche had gone missing on a number of occasions in her life. Her final disappearance was reported on July 10, 2004, to Waterford Garda station.\nPaiche's body was discovered by a woman out walking at Brenor Bridge, Piltown, on July 23, 2004. Her decapitated body was wrapped in a black plastic bag and her head was missing. She had been badly beaten. She was later identified by fingerprints she had supplied when she applied for asylum.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nGardaí questioned Chika Onyemaechi about his wife's murder and he was released without charge. Gardaí searched the home where Paiche was living and discovered that sections of carpet were missing. A waste ground near her home was also searched, as was her car. Chika went missing shortly after his wife's murder and did not attend her funeral. Chika is still missing. Gardaí remain eager to speak to him.\nGardaí investigated the possibility that Paiche's murder was related to her work as a lap dancer and prostitute and interviewed a number of her clients.\nGardaí also investigated the possibility that the murder was a ritualistic killing. Following the murder of Farah Swaleh Noor, newspapers linked the crime with the murder of Paiche, labelling them the work of a 'voodoo killer.' Farah Swaleh Noor's murder was solved and had no ritualistic motive.\nIn 2004 an anonymous letter was sent to Gardaí which contained information on the culprits of the murder. The contents were not disclosed to the public.\nIn August 2004, two men were arrested for questioning into the murder and were later released without charge. A Nigerian woman was arrested for questioning in relation to the murder in October 2004 and was also released without charge.\nIn 2006, a Nigerian man named Chijioke Ezekwem was charged with failing to disclose information in relation to Paiche's murder.\n\n\n== Media ==\nPaiche's murder attracted a large amount of media attention when it was learned that her father was the sitting Chief Justice of Malawi. However, the level of attention her murder received in comparisson to white murder victims was criticised.\nPaiche's murder has been covered in a number of true crime books including, Passport to Murder: True Stories of Foreginers Killed in Ireland by Ali Bracken, Dead Men Talk by Sandra Mara, and Blood Rights by Jimmy Lee Shreeve.\nPaiche's murder inspired an art piece by Áine Phillips for her project The Lost Runway in 2010.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Theory of Every Language (Albanian: Teoria e çdo gjuhe) proposes that every language can be traced back far enough to where every language sounds alike or the same. This theory is commonly associated with Albanian historian Agron Dalipaj and more, such as Elena Kocaqi. He argues that the Albanian language is the oldest in Europe because it contains monosyllabic words such as \"ha\" (eat), \"pi\" (drink), \"rri\" (stay) and more, which only the Albanian language commonly has. In addition, some Albanian dialects, such as Gheg Albanian or the type of Albanian that people from the Malësia region talk, have even shorter words such as \"u\" (I) and \"a\" (am), which can be combined to form phrases like \"U a\" (I am) or \"Aty o\" (There it is). A person who speaks Gheg Albanian can say \" U a ai\" which means \"I am him\". These words are not very common in Gheg Albanian, since these are now only used in mountainous/old cities and villages, and not in every Gheg-speaking place. The rest of the modern Gheg Albanian places, say \"I am him\" as \"Un' jo' ai\".\n\n\n== More Reasons ==\nAgron Dalipaj makes it clear that Albanian is the oldest language in Europe and even in the world, because languages have started with one-syllable words, and have worked their way up to what we now have 3-6+ syllable words. These one-syllable words cannot be found in any language except Albanian, which further proves the point of Agron Dalipaj.\nHe mainly proves his point with etymologies of words from different languages, which he uses Albanian to find the meaning of the words. \nSome examples are the Albanian word \"Jorgan\" which means blanket, Agron Dalipaj says that if we flip the word, we get \"na 'groh\" which means \"keeps us warm\" in the Albanian language.\nHe uses another example, he uses the words \"Semplice-Panda\" (Semplice is Italian and means forever and Panda means forever in the Greek language). He makes a point of saying that Panda is used as the word for forever, which is uninterrupted time because it is always. Agron Dalipaj says that panda means uninterrupted also in the Albanian language since the Gheg Albanians say the word \"uninterrupted\" as \"pa nda' \" and in the Tosk dialect as \"pa ndarë\". He then uses the word \"Sempre\" and puts an apostrophe between the letters S and E, making \"S'empre\" which in the Albanian language means untouched, he explains this by saying that forever, is time that does not end/is not touched or disturbed by anything.\nAgron Dalipaj has also made a book called \"Greqishtja: Një bijë e Shqipes\" which means \"Greek: A daughter of the Albanian\" where he explains Greek words to both dialects of the Albanian language and even shows how they have evolved to how they are now.\n\n\n== References ==\n•Gjuha Kozmike - Author: Agron Dalipaj 2016 - 208 pages. \n•Gjuha Kozmike 2 - Author: Agron Dalipaj 2017 - 208 pages\n•Greqishtja: Një bijë e shqipes - Author: Agron Dalipaj 2019",

Bridgett returns that love right back to her mother, unfettered from any hesitation or sense of lack. From the first word to the last, there is nothing in the book but adoration, reverence, and affection.\"\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nShifting Through Neutral, Amistad, Hardcover, ISBN 0060572493; paperback, ISBN 0-06-057250-7.\nInto the Go-Slow, 2014, ISBN 978-1-55861-864-0\nThe World According to Fannie Davis, 2019, ISBN 978-0316558730\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBridgett M.

        "content": "Eugen Brandeis (Geisingen, 23 September 1846 – Bad Säckingen, 9 December 1930) was a German merchant and engineer in Central America and an administrative official in the German colonies in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBrandeis, a son of the Russian court councillor Hermann Brandeis, attended high school in Baden-Baden from 1854 to 1861, then high school in Freiburg, where he graduated in 1863. Until 1866 he studied mathematics, first at the Karlsruhe University of Technology, then at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg. During his studies in Karlsruhe he became a member of the Corps Saxonia in 1864.In 1866 he joined the 5th Baden Infantry Regiment as an “Advantageur”. From 1868 he served as a lieutenant in the Grand Duchy of Baden field artillery regiment, with which he also took part in the Franco-Prussian War. From 1873 he served in the Silesian foot artillery. In 1875 he was promoted to first lieutenant. In 1876 he became an officer in the reserves and voluntarily retired from the Baden Army the following year.From 1877 to 1881, Brandeis worked as a merchant for a Hamburg trading house in Gonaïves, Haiti. From 1879 to 1882 he administered the German consulate in Haiti. At the same time, in 1880 he worked on railway construction in Cuba. In 1884, Brandeis was employed as an engineer during the construction of the Panama Canal. Due to illness, he was seconded to the German consulate in Sydney in 1886.\nBetween 1886 and 1888, during the Samoan Civil War, Brandeis advised the Samoan King Tupua Tamasese Titimaea, who had come to power with German support. He trained a local police force loyal to the king and provided the king's supporters with weapons to protect the colonists from their opponents, and to crush protests against the newly imposed poll tax on the locals. He left Apia in February 1889. At the same time he was a member of the Secret Chancellery of the Foreign Office. From 1 December 1889 to 15 April 1891, Brandeis was secretary at the Imperial Commissariat on Jaluit in the Marshall Islands, then deputy commissioner. Brandeis was also a member of the German Trade and Plantation Society (DHPG).\nOn 5 February 1892 Brandeis was appointed Chief Judge for the Eastern District of Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands of the Colony of German New Guinea. In July 1893 there were riots due to the illegal expansion of the German New Guinea Company plantations. Brandeis responded to the local uprising with a punitive expedition.\nFrom 17 December 1892 to 14 December 1894 (acting until 5 February 1893) he was a judge in Herbertshöhe (today Kokopo) on the island of Neupommern (today New Britain) for the colony of the German New Guinea Company. During the dispute between the colonist Georg Schmiele and Paul Kolbe, husband of \"Queen Emma\" in June 1894, Brandeis pointed out to the former his \"duty\" as an officer, namely to challenge Kolbe to a pistol duel at 15 m. In the same year he undertook another punitive expedition against the native population as a captain with other colonists.\nFrom 1895 to 1898 he worked in Berlin in the Imperial Colonial Office of the Foreign Office.\nSince 24 March 1898, he was Imperial commissioner for the Marshall Islands, where he arrived on 28 August, only four months after his appointment. His title changed to Landeshauptmann on 22 February 1900. He retired on 18 January 1906. His removal was presumably due to excessive punishment and brutality towards the locals. During this stage he took part voluntarily in World War I.\n\n\n=== Family ===\nOn 30 April 1898, Brandeis married his second wife in Beirut. His wife Antonie Brandeis (25 March 1868 – 1945) was a daughter of merchant Rudolph Heinrich Ruete and Emily Ruete (born as Sayyida Salme, a princess of Oman and Zanzibar). The daughters Marie Margarethe (born September 6, 1900, in Jaluit) and Julia Johanna (born August 10, 1904, in Jaluit) came from the marriage.\nAntonie Brandeis worked in nursing in Jaluit and collected ethnographical items. Since 1908 she was actively involved in the Women's Association of the German Colonial Society. In 1911 she took part in the International Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden, organized by Friedrich Fülleborn. After her separation from Brandeis, Antonie lived in Hamburg and was instrumental in founding the Colonial Women's School in Rendsburg. In 1907 she wrote the Cookbook for the Tropics (Kochbuch für die Tropen).\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nIron Cross (1870) 2nd Class in 1871\nOrder of the Zähringer Lion:\nCross of Merit in 1870?\nKnight's Cross 2nd Class in 1871\nKnight's Cross 1st Class with Oak Leaves in 1908\n\n\n== Bibliography and sources ==\nDirk H.

It remained in Edward Solly's private collection until being bought in 1821 by the industrialist Barthold Suermondt. He then owned it until 1874, when the Gemäldegalerie  acquired it. It was later moved to the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum and then on the outbreak of the Second World War to the Flakturm Friedrichshain.\n\n\n== References ==",

The scheme is in response to the Biden administration's plan to decarbonise the freight industry as part of the wider National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program.\nThe initial rollout of 100 charging points is planned across three sites in Southern California: Colton, Barstow and Baker. Facilities are expected to be spaced around 60 to 90 miles (97 to 145 km) apart along the corridor. Greenlane plans to use a data-driven approach to decide where to build future stations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Jonathan Elliot (1784 – March 12, 1846) was an English-American printer, newspaper editor, and publisher of a series of historical document compilations. Immigrating to New York City as an adolescent, he served as a foreign volunteer during the Colombian War of Independence, before returning to the United States for a brief stint of service in the War of 1812. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1813, where he began work as a newspaper publisher. After the publication of his daily Washington City Gazette was disrupted by the British sack of Washington, he revived the paper as the Washington City Weekly Gazette. After strongly supporting the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of William H. Crawford in 1816, Elliot was rewarded with a series of lucrative printing contracts, which allowed him to return to a daily publication. \nFollowing business conflict with John Quincy Adams and another unsuccessful candidacy by Crawford in 1824, Elliot sold the paper to John Silva Meehan and largely exited the news industry. Later in his career, Elliot published a series of history books and compilations of historical documents. These included the Debates, a three-volume overview of the state ratifying conventions of the Constitution, used as a reference text until the late 20th century, and his Resolutions, detailing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which he saw as \"the most important statement of constitutional federalism\". Little is known about Elliot's personal life, beyond that he married twice and had four children. He died in Washington D.C. in March 1846, a year after publishing his final work, The Funding System of the United States and of Great Britain.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJonathan Elliot was born near Carlisle, England in 1784. He emigrated to the United States in 1802, and began work as a printer in New York City. Motivated by political zeal, he traveled to Caracas in 1810 to fight under Simón Bolívar in the Venezuelan War of Independence, where he was severely wounded in combat. Following General Francisco de Miranda's surrender to Spanish forces in 1812, he was taken prisoner, but was able to return to the United States in 1813. He enlisted within the United States Army upon his return, with the intent of serving in the War of 1812, though it is unclear whether he saw combat.\n\n\n== News publications ==\nAfter his military service, he settled in Washington, D.C. He partnered with two other editors in December 1813 to produce the city's first daily evening newspaper, the Washington City Gazette. The Gazette saw its first publication in January 1814, although it ceased publication following the destruction of his printing press during the British sack of Washington in August 1814. He revived the publication in November 1815 as the Washington City Weekly Gazette. The paper heavily championed Georgia senator William H. Crawford's campaign for the Democratic-Republican nomination in the 1816 United States presidential election, although James Monroe was able to win both the nomination and the general election. Crawford, appointed by Monroe as Secretary of War, rewarded the paper with lucrative printing contracts with the Department of War (and following Crawford's transfer to Treasury Secretary, the Department of the Treasury.)\n\nThe paper returned to daily status in 1817 as the City of Washington Gazette, funded by increased patronage and government printing contracts. Although continuing to favor Crawford, Elliot offered support to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in the 1824 presidential election in exchange for printing contracts. Adams had previously hired Elliot for printing services, but refused further commissions due to high prices. Elliot threatened to sink Adams' campaign, claiming that he had previously prevented John C. Calhoun from becoming president, but Adams continued to reject his services. Adams later described Elliot as \"having no character of his own—penurious and venal—metal to receive any stamp.\" Elliot once again rallied support for Crawford, but the campaign collapsed after Crawford suffered a stroke.In early 1826, the Gazette was sold to John Silva Meehan, who renamed the paper the United States' Telegraph. Elliot largely retired from journalism, although briefly worked as an editor for We the People, an anti-Jacksonian and pro-Henry Clay campaign paper published from March to November, 1828.\n\n\n== History publications ==\nFollowing his retirement from news publication, Elliot began publishing various history books and compilations of historical documents. His three-volume Debates (1827–1830), covering the adoption of the Constitution by state ratifying conventions, remained the sole scholarly source until the late 20th century, although faced later academic criticism for possible partisan bias. He may have published the work in order to support Calhoun, despite previously opposing the candidate. Elliot's Debates was republished in seven different editions, each varying slightly: as a result, the work has been described as a \"bibliographical brainteaser.\" Elliot apologized for any shortcomings in the preface to the first edition of the Debates, writing \"the sentiments they contain may, in some instances, have been inaccurately taken down.\" Such errors may have been exasperated by inaccurate shorthand reporting during the conventions.\nLater in 1827, he published the Diplomatic Code of the United States of America. An 1832 2nd edition of Elliot's Code was adopted by Secretary of State Louis McLane as a standard text for the State Department. In 1830, he published a history of Washington, D.C., titled Historical Sketches of the Ten Miles Square Forming the District of Columbia. His 1832 Resolutions included various excerpts related to the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which Elliot viewed as \"the most important statement of constitutional federalism\" and \"the true principles of the constitution.\" In 1845, he published his final work, a compilation of American and British treasury reports and public debt debates entitled The Funding Systems of the United States and of Great Britain.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nLittle is known of Elliot's personal life, leading to his description as a \"phantom\" and \"bibliographic abstraction\" by the Dictionary of American Biography. An obituary described him as \"frank, generous, warm-hearted\". He married twice, and had four children. He died in Washington D.C. on March 12, 1846.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

JCH is the youth supporter of the CHEGA party. Currently, Youth is coordinated by MP Rita Matias.\n\n\n== Genesis ==\nJCH, as the Youth of the CHEGA Party, is dedicated to the political training of young people, adopting as principles and values the provisions of the statutes of the CHEGA Party. Pursuant to article 2 of its Statutes, the JCH's fundamental tasks are:\n\nThe promotion and defense of political democracy in its social, economic and cultural aspects, enshrined in the values of the Rule of Law and the emerging principles of human dignity;\nThe protection of human dignity and the fundamental value of freedom in its various aspects, against all forms of totalitarianism;\nThe promotion of the common good and intergenerational and territorial solidarity, with a view to promoting the integral development of the Nation;\nThe defense of a secular State independent of any church or religion, without prejudice to the safeguard and inviolability of the fundamental right to religious and cultural practice, within the framework of the basic values of the Democratic Rule of Law;\nThe defense of History, Culture and the Portuguese language, with a view to promoting the cultural and scientific development of the Nation as constitutionally guaranteed values;\nThe fight against corruption of interests and all forms of weakening of the Republic that we are witnessing today, namely corruption in the State, the weakening of security forces and bonds of solidarity within the community;\n\n\n== National Directorate ==\nThe JCH National Directorate is the body responsible for implementing and executing the political strategy defined by the Party's National Directorate, as well as for political oversight of the activities of district and regional youth bodies. The members of the JCH National Board are appointed by the Party's National Board, following a proposal from the Youth Coordinator, for 3-year terms. The National Board is made up of 1 president, 1 secretary-general, 3 vice-presidents and 6 direction vowel.\n\n\n== Present ==\nChega's youth is currently involved in the Party's activities, participating in its events and contributing to the promotion of proposals to be presented by the party in elections and in the Assembly of the Republic. The number of young people enrolled in Youth increased from three thousand in 2023 to six thousand in 2024, related to the growth of the campaign on social media. In the first survey of 2024, CHEGA was indicated as the party with the most votes among young people aged 18 to 34. After the 2024 legislative elections, CHEGA now has three MPs: Rita Matias, Madalena Cordeiro and Daniel Teixeira on the parliamentary group. Madalena Cordeiro is the youngest deputy in the current legislature, the XVI. In the previous legislature, the XV, the title of youngest deputy belonged to Rita Matias.\n\n\n== References ==",

Bougouma was first elected in 2015 as a deputy in the National Assembly of Burkina Faso for Ganzourgou Province. He was appointed by Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba as the Minister of Infrastructure of Burkina Faso on January 12, 2016. One of Bougouma's first actions was a deal with the World Bank for funding to build a road between Manga and Zabré. He then began repairs on National Road 22, which connects Djibo to Kongoussi. Bougouma's plan for infrastructure for 2017 was connecting various cities and rebuilding roads across Centre-Ouest Region.\nBougouma also oversaw the creation of the largest highway interchange in Ouagadougou in 2018. The interchange, and many others built by Bougouma were financed by external banks. In 2021, Prime Minister Christophe Dabiré presented his resignation and that of his government to President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, marking Bougouma's resignation as well. Ollo Franck Kansie succeeded him in Lassina Zerbo's government. Bougouma was also accused of using government funds to enrich himself.\n\n\n== References ==",

It, Saint Sebastian and Saint Jerome were commissioned for the private quarters of the prior of Certosa di San Martino for 100 ducats each. The Certosa also commissioned works from him for its choir and nave (Prophets and Patriarchs). The Certosa was a Carthusian monastery and so the work shows the order's founder Bruno of Cologne, harking back to a composition already used by Ribera of the Madonna and Child with that saint as seen in a work now in Berlin and Earthly Trinity with God the Father.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ancient Art Archive (AAA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation, visual documentation, and sharing of prehistoric works of art, particularly cave painting and petroglyphs, around the globe. The organization was founded in 2016 by photographer Stephen Alvarez following an assignment to photograph France's Chauvet Cave for National Geographic. As part of its mission to create and distribute 3D images of ancient artwork for educational purposes—many of which are threatened by climate change, mining operations, and vandalism—the Archive has launched the Mural of America, a collaboration of anthropologists, archaeologists, and Native American artists to document and provide cultural and scientific context to ten North American cultural landmarks. In 2022, members of the Archive team received wide media attention for their use of 3D photography in uncovering previously unseen cave art in Alabama's 19th Unnamed Cave.\n\n\n== Founding ==\nIn 2014, while on assignment for a National Geographic story on the roots of artistic expression (published as \"The Origins of Art\" in the January 2015 issue), Alvarez photographed prehistoric cave paintings in France's Chauvet Cave. As Alvarez described it, the experience of photographing the cave art—some as much as 35,000 years old—inspired him to find a way to \"digitally preserve what's there and deliver that to many more people than could otherwise see it.\" In 2016 Alvarez launched the Ancient Art Archive, a project to use photography, 3D modeling, and Virtual reality technology to capture detailed, three-dimensional records of ancient works of art. The Archive's founding board of advisors included archaeologists Jan Simek and Christopher Henshilwood, Arctic researcher and diver Joseph B. MacInnis, and Van Ling, visual effects supervisor on James Cameron's Titanic and many other films. To date the Ancient Art Archive has created explorable 3D models of rock art of Bears Ears National Monument, Chauvet Cave, Utah's San Rafael Swell, and precontact-era cave art of the Chickasaw Nation.\n\n\n== Discovery of prehistoric art in 19th Unnamed Cave ==\nIn 2022, Simek, Alvarez, and Alan Cressler (a photographer and hydrologic technician with the United States Geological Survey) teamed up to document Northern Alabama's 19th Unnamed Cave (so named to keep its location secret for preservation purposes). The cave, which Simek and Cressler had previously explored in the 1990s, is less than half a meter high and contains multiple artworks engraved into the clay ceiling, which Simek and colleagues identified as the work of Native American artists between 500 CE and 1000 CE. The purpose of the project (in conjunction with the Archive's Unnamed Caves Project) was to use photogrammetry to capture high-resolution images of the cave and its artworks. During the mapping of the cave, Alvarez captured more than 16,000 separate images that were later assembled by software into a fully explorable 3D model.\nAlthough the original purpose of the photogrammetric photography was simply to measure distances and relationships between the engravings, on later analysis the images revealed engravings that had been previously undetectable due to naturally accumulating mud, the shallowness of the etched drawings, and the cave's narrow confines. These works of art—believed by Simek to be among the largest in North America—included three anthropomorphs (humanlike figures), an enigmatic figure, and an eleven-foot engraving of a snake (possibly an eastern diamondback rattlesnake that was sacred to Indigenous people during the Woodland Period).\nThe use of 3D photogrammetry to identify cave art has been called \"exemplary and important work\" by Carla Klehm, an archaeologist at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (UAF), while University of South Florida archaeologist Thomas Pluckhahn observed that the project helped overturn previously held beliefs that \"forty years ago, no one would have thought the southeast had much cave art.\" The team's discovery was covered by global media including The Guardian, The New York Times, CNN, NBC News, USA Today, National Geographic, and Smithsonian.\n\n\n== The Mural of America ==\nIn 2023 the Ancient Art Archive launched The Mural of America, an initiative to document, share, and provide cultural and scientific context for ten landmark sites across North America. According to Alvarez, the project seeks to \"reframe American History to include the first 20,000 plus years of human habitation of the American continents.\" The project will feature the work of Native American anthropologists, archaeologists, and artists as part of an educational for children combining virtual reality exhibits and hands-on activities. Its principal collaborators include a number of the Archive's core team members: anthropologist Joe Watkins, Ph.D., a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; filmmaker Josh Cawley, a descendant of the Northwestern band of the Shoshone Nation; and Dustin Mater, a multimedia artist, storyteller, and member of the Chickasaw Nation. The Mural of America's inaugural project is an annotated 3D capture of Devilstep Hollow in Alvarez's home state of Tennessee.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and appearances ==\nIn September 2023, a selection of Alvarez's images of ancient artworks were presented by Vanderbilt University's Curb Center in an exhibition titled Reverberations: Roots of the Cedar Tree.\nIn February 2024, Alvarez and Mater were featured speakers at the National Geographic Society's Storytellers Summit, where they presented the work of The Mural of America.\n\n\n== Core team ==\nJoe Watkins, Ph.D., Choctaw archaeologist\nDustin Mater, Chickasaw multimedia artist\nStephen Alvarez, photographer\nStephanie Welsh, executive director\nJames Cawley, filmmaker\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nYouTube channel",

        "content": "Wealth Planet Perugia Volley, also known as Black Angels Perugia Volley, is an Italian professional women's volleyball club based in Perugia. The team currently plays in the Serie A2, Italy's second highest professional league.\n\n\n== Previous names ==\nDue to sponsorship, the club has competed under the following names:\n\nGecom Security Corciano (2009–2012)\nGecom Security Perugia (2012–2015)\nTUUM Perugia Volley (2015–2017)\nBartoccini Gioiellerie Perugia (2017–2019)\nBartoccini Fortinfissi Perugia (2019–present)\n\n\n== History ==\nWealth Planet was founded in 2005, but in its early days volleyball was not a part of the business. Instead Wealth Planet was focused on fitness, body building, healthy eating and well-being in general. However, in the late 2000s, Wealth Planet started supporting the local volleyball teams Colli del Tezio and Grifo Volley. In 2010, the company decided to join Serie C with its own volleyball team, Wealth Planet Village.\nIn August 2011, Wealth Planet Village was merged with the club Pallavolo Etruria Corciano to form Wealth Planet Etruria Village. After the merger, the club has one team in Serie B1, with the sponsored name Gecom Security Corciano, and one team in Serie C, with the sponsored name Multicopia Perugia. In 2012, the club changed its name from Wealth Planet Etruria Village to  Wealth Planet Perugia and the sponsored name of the Serie B1 team was changed to Gecom Security Perugia.\nIn 2017, after playing in Serie B1 for seven years, Wealth Planet Perugia got the chance to play its first season in Serie A2 due to repechage. In its second season (2018–2019) in Serie A2, Wealth Planet Perugia finished the regular season in pool B in first place. The club also won the subsequent promotion pool and was promoted to Serie A1 for the 2019–2020 season.\nIn the 2022–2023 season of Serie A1, Wealth Planet Perugia finished the regular season in 13th place and was relegated back to Serie A2. The club was able to return to Serie A1 again by winning the promotion pool in Serie A2 the following season (2023–2024).\n\n\n== Team ==\nThe following is the roster for the 2023–2024 season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Moses and Elijah hang behind the west facade, whilst the rest hang under the arches of the side chapels.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe work was one of a set of commissions from Ribera by the Certosa beginning in 1638 and also included a Pietà for the sacristy (moved to its current home in the sala del Tesoro Nuovo at the end of the 17th century), The Last Supper for the choir and Saint Jerome, Saint Sebastian and Saint Bruno Receiving the Rule for the prior's private quarters, for a total commission of around 2,160 ducats. He was paid 80 ducats per canvas in the set of twelve works in the side chapels and 50 ducats each for the two on the facade. Moses, Elijah and Noah were the first of the fourteen to be completed, with the others finished in the following five years - the last payment receipt was signed at the end of 1643 and eight of them are initially \"J.R.\" in the bottom corner.\n\n\n== Catalogue ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(in Italian) N.

        "content": "The Tourine ambush, also known as the Tourine massacre, was one of the September 14, 2008, jihadists from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) ambushed Mauritanian soldiers in the village of Tourine, near Zouérat, Mauritania. The ambush was the first major attack by AQIM during the Insurgency in the Sahel, and sparked major changes in the Mauritanian military.   \n\n\n== Background ==\nSince 2005, remnants of the jihadist Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) militia that committed various massacres during the Algerian Civil War began conducting an insurgency in rural Mauritania and Mali. Between 2005 and 2008, the group recruited from Mauritanian madrasas, and renamed itself to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and established ties with the global Al-Qaeda network in 2007. \nAQIM was able to gain so much influence in Mauritania due to the country's relatively weak military and impoverished, rural society. \n\n\n== Ambush ==\nOn the night between September 14 and 15, 2008, a patrol of six Mauritanian army vehicles drove south from Zouérat. Eighty kilometers from the city, near the village of Tourine, AQIM fighters ambushed the convoy. The initial report stated that four vehicles were destroyed, damaged, or captured, and eleven soldiers and a guide were missing. Survivors of the ambush returned to the base in Zouerat. A text from AQIM emir Abdelmalek Droukdel the following day confirmed that AQIM carried out the ambush. Droukdel claimed to have captured twelve soldiers and three vehicles. \nOn September 20, the Mauritanian government announced the discovery of twelve bodies all found decapitated. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a senior AQIM member, denied that the Mauritanian soldiers were beheaded by AQIM, although it is unlikely he was present during the ambush. The ambush and beheadings were likely carried out by three other katibas, commanded by Abdelhamid Abou Zeid and Djamel Okacha.  \nIn 2008, in response, to the attack, parts of northern Mauritania were considered a \"military zone\" to prevent further AQIM attacks. \nSpecial Intervention Groups were also created to patrol the desert, and new cities were created to help monitor nomadic societies in which jihadists could be embedded. On March 20, 2011, four AQIM jihadists were sentenced to death in Nouakchott for their involvement in the ambush and beheadings. Another jihadist was sentenced to two years in prison, and one was acquitted. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dog Island is an uninhabited island located on the eastern side of Lesser Slave Lake near the town of Slave Lake in Alberta, Canada. \n\n\n== Name origin ==\nThe name comes from the sled dogs that used to be left on the island by fur traders during the summer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere was originally a fishery on the island ran by the Hudson's Bay Company where they left out fish for their sled dogs. During the early 20th century, steamships were used to transport travellers between Salteaux and Grouard on opposite sides of the lake. Many of these travellers would then continue on to the Grouard-Peace River trail to reach the highly sought after fertile land of the Peace River Country. The main steamship who did this journey was the Northern Light which was captained by Hermann Nicklaus, a German immigrant who along with his wife and two Irish immigrants, lived on a homestead on the island where they raised chickens and cattle. After the railway came through, making the use of steamships obsolete, the island was leased to a commercial fishing company. Eventually the island was made part of Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park. In 2013, a canoe carrying two boys capsized just south of the island, one of the boys was rescued one hour later but the other drowned.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of islands of Canada\n\n\n== References ==",

The book explores representations of cultural contact between “France” and the Islamic and Byzantine worlds.\nIn 2021, Kinoshita delivered the Medieval Academy of America plenary at the International Congress on Medieval Studies Kalamazoo virtual conference, on “Marco Polo and the Diversity of the Global Middle Ages”.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nTranslator, Marco Polo, The Description of the World.

        "content": "The Last Supper or The Communion of the Apostles is a 1651 oil on canvas painting by Jusepe de Ribera, still in the choir of the Certosa di San Martino in Naples, for which it was commissioned.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was commissioned by Giovan Battista Pisante, the Certosa's prior, to complete the cycle of paintings decorating its church's choir. That cycle already included Adoration of the Shepherds (1642) by Guido Reni along the front, The Last Supper (1589) by Paolo Veronese and The Passover of the Hebrews (1639) by Massimo Stanzione along the right side and Christ Washes the Disciples' Feet (1622) by Battistello Caracciolo and Ribera's painting along the left side.\nHe was commissioned in 1638 for the sum of 1,000 ducats. The overall scheme for the Certosa church also included Ribera's fourteen Prophets for the church's nave and Saint Jerome, Saint Sebastian and Saint Bruno Receiving the Rule for the prior's private quarters, for a total commission of around 2,160 ducats. Due to several other commissions (and from 1640 a serious illness) he only completed and delivered the commission in 1651.\nAfter Ribera's death his heirs filed a lawsuit against the Certosa's monks to renegotiate the contract, particularly The Last Supper, arguing for a higher sum thanks to its high quality and large number of figures (initially set as ten at a rate of 100 ducats per full figure but thirteen by the time the work was finished). The Tribunale granted the heirs the higher sum of 1,300 ducats and therefore directed that they be given 300 more ducats.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(in Italian) Nicola Spinosa, Jusepe de Ribera, in Art e Dossier, n. 66, Giunti Editore, Milano, 1992.\n(in Italian) Nicola Spinosa, Ribera.

        "content": "Diego Alfonso de Medrano (b. Logroño, 16th century – d. 17th century) was a noble from the House of Medrano and a prominent alchemist tried by the Spanish inquisition. He practiced alchemical medicine in Madrid, collaborating with many of the city's leading physicians, distillers and apothecaries. Medrano worked within an environment of alchemy that prospered at the Spanish court. He was the tutor of the Duke of Infantado.\n\n\n== Life and background ==\n\nDon Diego Alfsono de Medrano was from the important and noble House of Medrano in Logroño, La Rioja. Pedro de Toledo Osorio, II Duke of Ferdandina was the patron of Diego Alfonso de Medrano. Medrano’s wife was a wealthy Sicilian noblewoman and it is possible that she may have connected him with alchemists of Italian origin in Aranjuez. Pedro de Toledo Osorio, II Duke of Ferdandina was also the 5th Marquess of Villafranca del Bierzo, Governor of the Duchy of Milan, Prince of Montalbano, a Spanish-Italian nobleman and a Grandee of Spain. \n\n\n=== Education ===\nDiego Alfonso de Medrano was an established nobleman and in his home town of Logroño he initially started his study of alchemical medicine. His method of crafting medicines was scholarly, deeply rooted in the traditional alchemical and hermetic literature that utilized a complex language of emblems, mystical symbols and allegories to decipher medical secrets. Diego Alfonso de Medrano's practice of alchemical medicine was supposedly linked with astrology and 'magic'.\n\n\n=== Tutor to the Duke of Infantado ===\nDon Diego Alfonso de Medrano served as the tutor to the Duke of Infantado during the latter half of the 16th century. His position as the Duke's educator solidified his ties with the court's noble and scientific circles, which included many Italians. Diego's teachings to the Duke encompassed a variety of subjects, astrology among them.\n\n\n== Trials in the Spanish Inquisition ==\n\nPrior to Diego Alfonso de Medrano's trial in 1611, he faced trial in 1601 for having previously been found guilty of sorcery in his hometown of Logroño. \n\n\n=== Medrano's first trial (1601) ===\nA summary of the first case (relación de causa) still exists within the archives of the Suprema. Records indicate he was accused of:\n\n\"...having made many sigils of different metals and many clay and wax figurines of men and women, all pertaining to Santa Maria...\"\n\n\n=== Sentenced to the Galleys of Spain (1601) ===\n\nThe summary forwarded to the Suprema revealed that the inquisitors in Logroño had subjected Diego Alfonso de Medrano to torture, including the rack and garrote, compelling him to confess to creating sigils, engaging in judicial astrology, and holding banned books. Following a protracted trial with fifty-five witnesses, the Inquisition branded him a heretic, they banished Medrano and condemned him to 10 years in the galleys of the king. Later on, when inquisitors from Toledo sought details of this trial from their counterparts in Rioja, an inquisitorial familiar exaggeratedly described Diego Alfonso de Medrano as \"in the field of sorcery, lies, and demonic dealings [Medrano] must be the most notable delinquent in the entire kingdom.\"\n\n\n=== Return to Madrid (1606) ===\nDiego Alfonso de Medrano ultimately spent only five years as an oarsman on the King's galleys. By around 1606, while he was in Madrid awaiting his subsequent assignment \"with much clemency,\" the Inquisition showed considerable leniency by converting his galley sentence into additional years of exile. Despite this ban, he soon settled in Madrid, positioning himself as an expert in alchemical medicine and aligning with some of Madrid's leading doctors, pharmacists, and distillers.\n\n\n=== Medrano's second trial (1611) ===\nDiego Alfonso de Medrano faced trial under the Toledo Inquisition for supposedly having a pact with a demon. In February 1611, the Inquisition took Medrano into custody. Pedro García, the inquisitorial familiar responsible for his arrest, later reminisced about the moment he approached Medrano on the Duke of Infantado's staircase, noting how Medrano's complexion turned pale, and he supposedly wore an expression of guilt. During the arrest, García discovered an empty glass vial and a copy of \"The hundred conclusions and method of knowing the true skill founded on science\" by Luís Pacheco de Narváez on Medrano. García detained Medrano, escorting him to the Inquisition’s jail where he would stay pending his trial in July.\n\n\n==== Testimonies ====\nA notable individual who spoke in support of Medrano during his trial in 1611 was Valerio Forte, the chief distiller (destilador mayor) for Philip III. Valerio Forte acknowledged that he had provided Medrano with an astrology book, which Medrano utilized in his capacity as a tutor to the Duke of Infantado. Medrano also received support during his trial from medical practitioners, among them an apothecary and a distinguished physician who had his practice on San Bernardo Street, known as Doctor Lara.\n\n\n==== Clerical evaluation ====\nIn the period of late March and early May 1611, Inquisitors dispatched portions of the texts seized from Diego Alfsonso de Medrano to three different monasteries for evaluation. A parcel, marked March 23, was directed to San Pedro Mártir in Toledo, another was sent on May 2 to Fray Hernando de Tobar at San Bernardo, and a third on May 9 to Estevan de Oxeda and Rodrigo Nino. The file includes critiques from the first two monasteries, which found Medrano’s writings to be heretical. Both reviews denounced Medrano’s works, with the first one being fairly brief, stating that Diego Alfonso de Medrano’s compositions \"speak of sigils and contain much superstition.\" The friar from San Pedro Mártir, who examined the documents, observed that one of Diego's papers \"contained an ensalmo that seems to indicate an implicit pact with the devil.\" The second evaluation by Fray Hernando de Tobar was extensive and more detailed.\n\n\n=== Medrano's defense (1611) ===\nDiego Alfonso de Medrano was given a chance to defend himself. In his submission to the inquisitors, Diego launched a vigorous defense of his integrity while sharply criticizing his adversaries, whom he argued provided evidence that was unreliable due to their prejudice. Despite being labeled a converso by the prosecutor, Medrano firmly maintained his status as an Old Christian of a distinguished noble lineage along with his connections of the scientific elite in Madrid, especially Valerio Forte. Diego singled out his antagonists as \"anyone from Logroño\" and, more specifically, targeted his \"mortal enemy\" Juan de Ibañez, accusing him of having an affair with his wife. This conflict with Ibañez escalated into a violent sword fight, leading to Diego facing criminal charges and subsequently being ordered by a Valladolid chancery judge to leave the capital, a verdict that severed his ties with his wife and diminished his esteemed position in Madrid.\n\nDiego explained that the President of the Council of Castile, Pedro de Galeas, had helped him secure royal approval to return to court. However, once back, his adversaries saw an opportunity to extort him, seizing his notebooks and blackmailing him with a hefty fee he couldn't afford, under the threat of turning him in to the authorities. When accused of improperly using astrology and creating unauthorized sigils, he stated that he had abandoned such practices after leaving Logroño, noting that carrying on without the required astrological texts was out of the question. He tried to shift the fault to Carmona, math teacher of the monarchs, accusing him of being an unproductive troublemaker with the necessary books for judicial astrology. Medrano also dismissed allegations of practicing lapidary magic and shared that his conversations about using stones were concurred with by the cantor of the royal chapel, who also didn’t view them as superstitious.\n\n\n==== The Philosphers' stone ====\n\nDuring the trial, Diego Alfonso de Medrano additionally referenced a method he discovered in a book written by Isabella Cortese, her modern book of secrets, which recommended using lead as a substitute for antimony. Medrano provided more details, explaining the eight alchemical processes and the various substances (including medicinal concoctions) that resulted from them. Medrano asserted that this proccess ultimately brings forth the end result \"with the property to transmute metals and human bodies.\" Diego clarified that these processes were also known by esoteric titles, which the Spanish Inquisition mistakenly construed as heretical commentary on the human body's structure. Diego Alfonso de Medrano revealed to the inquisitors:\n\n\"[This] explains the two ciphers of the Philosopher’s Stone under the name of ‘man’ and not ‘man’ as in human, which only consists of body and soul.\" \n\nResponding to the allegation that human beings consist of three or more substances, Medrano offered deep insights into his approach as both a healer and alchemist. He clarified that his notebook entries on the triad of human elements—body, mind, and soul—were in fact an alchemical allegory. \nHe pointed out that alchemy was intentionally obscure, demanding the decoding of multiple layers to grasp the essence used in metal transmutation and medicine creation. Medrano indicated that any mention of human composition in his writings actually refer to the Philosophers' Stone, with \"body, mind, and spirit\" representing sulfur, mercury, and salt. He explained that these elements themselves were allegorical, with the true components of the Philosophers' Stone being gold, antimony, and quicksilver. Medrano maintained that this method of representing the three elements was widely used by scholars, backing his argument with references to a variety of authoritative sources:\n\n\"All of the books by the philosophers agree that the [Philosophers'] stone consists of body, soul, and spirit, which is composed of the said minerals, gold, antimony, and mercury or quicksilver, reduced in liquors in order to unite and mix them, and the authors of this are, Ramon Llull, Johannes de Rupescissa, Arnau de Vilanova, Morieno, Albertus Magnus, Avicenna, Al-Razi, Aristotle (De Perfecto magisterio, a thirteenth-century work misattributed to Aristotle), Joanes and Saalo Olando, and the authors get those three substances from the authors of Theatrum Chemicum, Turba Philosophorum, Margarita preciosa, and Roger Bacon; Johannes Anglicus and Andreas Libavius the doctor put certain hieroglyphics on the Philospher’s Stone of body, soul, and spirit, painting a crowned king, and Geber the philosopher speaks of this; all of them write in a way that is veiled and covered under diverse names.\"\n\n\n=== Medrano's sentence (1611) ===\nIn July 1611, the Toledo tribunal's prosecuting attorney charged Diego Alfonso de Medrano, known for distilling alchemical medicines, with supposedly being in a pact with a demon. Despite the support of Diego Alfonso de Medrano's powerful associates, inquisitors found him guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine of 30,000 maravedís, receive two hundred flagellations, and face lifelong seclusion in either a hospital or a monastery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Biography ==\nInquisition and Science in Modern Spain  by Sagrario Muñoz Calvo, 1977.\nSaraiva, António José (2001).

        "content": "The Republican caucuses took place on Super Tuesday, March 6, 2012. An advisory primary with no binding effect on delegates, scheduled to be held on Tuesday May 15, 2012, was cancelled by the Idaho Republican Party. Five candidates were on the ballot. In order of filing they are Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Buddy Roemer. Although Roemer had withdrawn from the Republican race before the Idaho caucus, he still appeared on the ballot.\nMitt Romney won 61% of the vote, thanks to a large majority of support (80-90% in most counties) in majority Mormon southeastern Idaho, rendering it a winner-take-all contest. Santorum and Paul split the Panhandle, winning five counties each, but came away empty in the delegate count.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nIdaho has 32 delegates to the Republican national convention, of which 3 are RNC and 29 are AL. The 3 RNC delegates pledged to go with the results of the Boise Straw Poll. The delegates will be determined by the caucuses results, based on a two-step approach. First, the delegates are primarily awarded winner-take-all by county after a series of votes in which candidates are successively removed from the ballot. Then, if a candidate receives half or more of the county delegates, he will receive all the 32 delegates; if not, the delegates will be split proportionately according to the number of county delegates.\n\n\n== Polling ==\n\n\n=== Straw polls ===\nDespite a complete lack of formal polling in the state, there were a total of five straw polls conducted in Idaho, three of which were online. Ron Paul won three of these, while Mitt Romney won two.\n\n\n==== January 2–4 online poll ====\nThis was the first ever Idaho straw poll. It was conducted entirely online by Kaz Wittig KStar Enterprises. Ron Paul won with over 70% of the vote.\n\n\n==== January 6 Boise poll ====\nThis poll used paper ballots and was conducted in Boise. Ron Paul won this poll. Rick Perry's campaign, although still active in the race at this time, did not participate.\n\n\n==== February 2–4 online poll ====\nThis online straw poll was also produced by Kaz Wittig KStar Enterprises. Mitt Romney won the poll by a small margin.\n\n\n==== March 1–3 online poll ====\nThis poll was also produced by Kaz Wittig KStar Enterprises. Ron Paul won by a double-digit margin.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== County totals ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThat these totals reflect the final caucus ballots in each county; where only two candidates have votes totaled, this was likely from other candidates being eliminated in previous rounds of voting. Where all candidates have at least one vote, only one ballot was necessary, since the winning candidate had a majority of votes in that county.\nVote totals for Buddy Roemer, who had formally withdrawn from the Republican race before the caucus, are not provided.\n\n\n== References ==",

Roxane Bruneau, who served as a coach on La deuxième voix in the ninth season, joined the panel as a main coach this season, replacing Marc Dupré. Additionally, debutant France D'Amour joined the panel, replacing Marjo.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nEach coach had 10 spots to fill in the Blind Auditions. Additionally, each coach can \"steal\" another artist in the Battles from another team, adding the artist to his/her team.\nColor key\n\n\n== Blind auditions ==\nIn the blind auditions, each artist sings a song to four coaches who have their chairs turned away from the artist. If a coach is interested in working with an artist, he/she will press the \"Je te veux\" button and will then face the artist. If only one coach turns, the artist defaults to that team. If more than one coaches turn, the artist chooses his/her coach. This season features the Block, which each coach can use twice to prevent one of the other coaches from getting a contestant. At the end of the blind auditions, France D'Amour did not use her second Block.\n\n\n=== Episode 1 (21 January) ===\n\n\n=== Episode 2 (28 January) ===\n\n\n=== Episode 3 (4 February) ===\n\n\n=== Episode 4 (11 February) ===\n\n\n=== Episode 5 (18 February) ===\n\n\n== Battles ==\nIn the battles, each coach pairs two of their artist together to perform a duet. The winner of each battle moves on to the Qualifications. Coaches are then given an opportunity to \"steal\" the loser if that artist is not on their team. Each coach has one \"steal\" to keep a loser in the competition and add them to their team, taking them to the next round. Artists who lose the battle and do not receive a \"steal\" are eliminated from the competition.\nAt the end of the round, each coach had five of their original artists and one stolen artist move on to the Qualifications. Roxane, France, and Mario all used their steal on an artist from Team Corneille, while Corneille used his steal on an artist from Team Roxane.\nColour key:\n\n\n== Qualifications ==\nThe Qualifications aired on 17 March and 24 March. In this round, each episode, all four coaches had three of their artists sing for a spot in the semi-final. One artist per team each episode moved on, while the other two were eliminated. \nColour key:\n\n\n=== Episode 9 (17 March) ===\n\n\n=== Episode 10 (24 March) ===\n\n\n== Semi-final ==\nThe semi-final aired on 31 March. In this stage, the remaining Top 8 artists, two from each team, performed \"cross-battles.\" On \"challenger\" coach pitted one of their artists against an artist from another coach's team. The winner was decided through the audience vote. This season was the first to feature this change in La Voix history. Due to this adjustment in format, it was not guaranteed that each coach would have an artist representing them in the final.\nCoaches Corneille, Roxane Bruneau, and France D'Amour all managed to bring their teams to the final with the advancements of Redge Olibrice, Jonathan Houde, and Maude Cyr-Deschênes and Lee-Anne Bergevin, respectively. With the advancements of Maude Cyr-Deschênes and Lee-Anne Bergevin, France D'Amour became the first coach in La Voix history to bring two of their artists to the finale. Additionally, with the eliminations of Priscilla Findlay and William Osias, Mario Pelchat no longer had any artists on his team, marking the first occurrence in La Voix history that a coach was not represented in the final.\n\n\n=== Episode 11 (31 March) ===\n\n\n== Final ==\nThe final aired on 7 April. Each of the remaining four artists sang to earn the highest amount of percentage points, thus being crowned La Voix.

        "content": "The Fatherland – Polish List (Polish: Ojczyzna – Lista Polska, OLP or O-LP) was an electoral alliance in Poland created by the National Party \"Fatherland\" (Polish: Stronnictwo Narodowe „Ojczyzna”). It was an electoral bloc that the National Party contested the 1993 Polish parliamentary election with. It unsuccessfully sought an alliance with a far-left agrarian socialist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.\nIn the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, the bloc was heavily undermined by the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\", a political Catholic coalition headed by Christian National Union (Polish: Zjednoczenie Chrześcijańsko-Narodowe, ZChN), which aspired to be a successor to the Catholic Electoral Action, a National-Catholic bloc from the 1991 Polish parliamentary election. Ultimately, Fatherland – Polish List failed to win any seats, receiving 15,958 votes, 0.12% of the total.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Polish Round Table Agreement and end of the communist period in Poland, Polish nationalist circles united to form National Party (Polish: Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) in 1989, which was a reactivation of an interwar national conservative party of the same name, the National Party.\nThe party was then formally registered in 1990 and restarted political activities. In the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, National Party won 74.082 votes equating to 0.66% of the popular vote. Shortly after the 1991 election, the party grew divided as notable factions and tendencies formed within it.\nAmongst the growing sectionalism, two 'tendencies' were particularly notable – the \"blue\" faction and the \"pink\" faction. The blue camp represented the traditional right and aspired to closely mimic the pre-war National Party, including supporting fully capitalist liberalism economy and rejecting the Polish communist period. In contrast, the 'pink camp' was considered a left-wing deviation, criticizing the blue party's line as being elitist and too clerical. The pink faction sought to focus on socio-economic issues and advocated state-owned economy, together with an expansive welfare state.\nIn February, Bogusław Rybicki, the leader of the pink faction, was expelled from the National Party, who was accused of being a communist civil servant. Several other activists of the party left the party in solidarity with Rybacki, and on 28 March 1992, they found National Party \"Fatherland\", which was to be a left-wing equivalent of the National Party. \nThe new formation reached 2100 members by 1993, and sought to run in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election. The party started talkings with Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Polish: Samoobrona Rzeczpospolitej Polskiej, commonly referred to as Samoobrona) in hopes of organizing an electoral coalition. Samoobrona was a far-left party; it became popular through its radical and aggressive agrarian protests, forming a paramilitary group \"Peasant Battalions\" (Polish: Bataliony Chłopskie), referring to a Polish agrarian WW2-era resistance movement of the same name, which protected farmers against bailiffs, evictions and police.\nSamoobrona and its radical leader, Andrzej Lepper, gained widespread attention through controversial statements such as \"We are a radical party, open to all disadvantaged people who are starving at home.\" and \"If someone has a billion or two or ten, they really couldn't have made it through legal work\" became widely reported and known.\" It had an unclear ideological profile; Polish political scientist Jarosław Tomasiewicz described it as a \"radical-populist\" party combined agrarianism, nationalism and \"Soviet-style\" communism.\nIdiosyncratic views of Samoobrona, combined with their populism, left-wing nationalism and radicalism, were appealing to the National Party \"Fatherland\", which represented a left-wing splinter from a right-wing, radically nationalist party. Despite Rybicki's efforts, Samoobrona rejected the idea of cooperating with his National Party. Samoobrona would later drift further left and cooperate with more clearly left-wing parties through Social Alliance.\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt to form a coalition with Samoobrona, the party decided to run in the election on its own, but open itself to cooperation with independent candidates and minor organizations through creating Fatherland – Polish List. This also allowed the party to distance itself from the 'main' National Party, which the party members considered too radical, especially in the wake of its 1991 electoral performance. Fatherland – Polish List was formally registered on 30 June 1993. It was located in Warsaw.\nHowever, the electoral bloc was undermined by the creation of Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" (Polish: Katolicki Komitet Wyborczy \"Ojczyzna\", KKW) in July. The KKW was led by National-Catholic Christian National Union and was a coalition of Christian-democratic and political-Catholic parties. It was largely based on the Catholic Electoral Action, a coalition from the 1991 Polish parliamentary election with similar program and purpose.\nUnlike the Catholic Electoral Action, which was staunchly right-wing and National-Catholic, the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" sought to present itself as a moderate party and build a broad coalition of both churchgoing and moderate Catholics. The committee sought an official endorsement from the Polish Catholic Church, but the Church strongly emphasized its neutrality, a decision influenced by the controversy caused by the clergy's alleged support for the Catholic Electoral Action in 1991. In light of this, the KKW organized through parish councils instead.\nThe Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" not only had an almost identical name to Fatherland – Polish List. National Party \"Fatherland\" and its allies strongly protested the \"theft\" of its committee and filed a lawsuit against the Catholic committee, but they were unable to hamper the KKW.\nUltimately, Fatherland – Polish List performed disastrously in the 1993 election, receiving only 15,958 votes, 0.12% of the total. Fatherland – Polish List was quickly dissolved after the election, and National Party \"Fatherland\" started disintegrating, with many of its members defecting to other parties, including Samoobrona. In 1996, the party decided to dissolve and return to its 'mother party', the National Party.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nDespite coming from a radically nationalist, right-wing background, Fatherland – Polish List put forward a leftist program that ignored cultural issues and focused solely on socioeconomic issues, together with somewhat inclusive, left-wing nationalist tone. The coalition was promoted an economy-focused, heavily populist rhetoric that distanced itself from the right:\n\nThe trouble with the national movement is that its rhetoric is completely detached from the life of the average Pole. What effect can be produced by constantly talking and writing about the Jews? These are magic incantations. On the other hand, such rhetoric frightens away millions of ordinary people whose main problem is how to make ends meet. The national programme must therefore be first and foremost a programme for normal Poles, not for the haunted trackers of various conspiracies.\nFatherland – Polish List argued that right-wing parties lack social sensivity, as they extend their \"right-wing hatred and dogma of anti-communism to the entire economic fabric, i.e. walls, machines, and the God-fearing workers\". It also attacked capitalism itself, arguing that it results in the development of nomenklatura and the 'stratification of society' where \"the rich control the state\". Fatherland – Polish List also rejected the concept of \"people's capitalism\" which was to be a market system based on social justice. According to the coalition, even a 'justice-oriented' capitalism would rapidly devolve into social and class divisions, and questioned the effectiveness of distributing the 'fruits of capitalism' to the general population.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1972 it was included in the village of Rubas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nIt was located on the left bank of the Rubas River, near the intersection of the river with the Caucasus Federal Highway. Currently, it represents the eastern part of the village of Rubas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTranslated from Turkic languages, “khosh manzil” means a good place or a pleasant place.\n\n\n== History ==\nKhoshmenzil is one of the historical places of residence of Mountain Jews in Dagestan. After the final annexation of Dagestan to Russia, the village of Khosh-Menzil became part of the Ullu mahallah of the South Tabasaransky nawab. And later became part of Kyurinsky district of the Dagestan region. The Mountain Jewish population of the village of Khoshmenzil was replenished at the beginning of the twentieth century at the expense of the residents of the village of Molla-Khalil. And in the 1910s, Ukrainian immigrants from the Poltava province settled higher up the river. The village was devastated during the Russian Civil War. With the final establishment of Soviet Union power, the village became part of the newly formed Kullar village council of the Maskut section of the Kyurinsky district. Since 1921 as part of the Derbentsky district. Already in 1920, 3 agricultural artels were organized in the village.\nIn 1927, the center of the Kullar village council was moved to the village of Khosh-Menzil, and the village council was accordingly renamed Khosh-Menzil.\nAccording to archival data for 1929, the village of Khosh-Menzil consisted of 82 households, and administratively it was the center of the Khosh-Menzil village council of the Derbentsky region. The village council also included the villages of Aglobi and Kullar, railway passing siding and barracks in Arablinskoye.\nIn 1930, a kolkhoz named after the Third International was organized, which in 1965 was transformed into the “Lenin's Way” sovkhoz. Apparently, in the early 1930s, a part inhabited by Russians and Ukrainians separated from the village and formed the Rubas farmstead. As of 1939, the village was the center of the Khoshmenzil village council, it also included the village of Aglobi, the hamlets of Third International and Rubas, the Arablinskoye station, the settlements of Bayatlar, Derbent-kala, Kullar, Muzaim, Turpak-Kala and Khuzayan, and the Smidovich farm.\nStarting from the 1930s, Azerbaijanis and Tabasarans from the Tabasaransky region began to move into the village, and the Mountain Jewish population, in turn, began to leave the village and move to Derbent.\nBy the 1950s, almost all Mountain Jews left the village.\nIn 1972, the village of Khoshmenzil was included in the expanding village of Rubas.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nAccording to archive data from 1886, Mountain Jews (77%) and Tatars (23%) lived in the village. According to the 1926 Soviet census, Mountain Jews (65%), Russians (23%), Ukrainians (9%) and Turks (2%) lived in the village.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nGyulboor Davydova (1892–1983), Soviet winegrower, manager of the collective farm named after Kaganovich, Hero of Socialist Labour (1949).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

        "content": "Shinhanchon (Korean: 신한촌; Hanja: 新韓村; lit. New Korea Village; Russian: Синханчхон; Новая Корейская Слободка) was an enclave of Koreans in Vladivostok, Russian Empire (later Far Eastern Republic then Soviet Union) that existed between 1911 and 1937. It also went by the name Shingaechŏk-ri (신개척리; 新開拓里). It holds an important place in the history of Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans of the mainland former Soviet Union), and is now remembered as a hub of the Korean independence movement.\nVladivostok's Korean population peaked at around 10,000 Koreans in the 1910s. The population presumably remained roughly around this size until 1937, after which they were all forcibly deported to Central Asia. Few visible traces of the enclave remain today. A small park on Khabarovskaya Ulitsa now exists at the location of its former entrance.\nThe enclave was not the only one to use this name; several other Korean settlements in Primorskaya Oblast and Jiandao (\"Gando\" in Korean) went by this name.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBefore the late 19th century, few Koreans left the Korean peninsula. Koreans occasionally ventured out into what is now Primorsky Krai to gather resources, but did not migrate there in significant numbers until a famine happened in Korea in 1869. The first Koreans arrived in Vladivostok around 1870. In 1886, their population was 400. This number more than doubled by 1891 to 840.\nThey congregated in an area they called Kaechŏk-ri (개척리; 開拓里; now around the intersection of Ulitsa Pologaya and Pogranichnaya Ulitsa). In recognition of their presence there, the local Vladivostok government named what is now Pogranichnaya Ulitsa to \"Kareiskaya Ulitsa\" (lit. 'Korean Street'); this name persisted until 1941.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1911, the former Korean district was forcefully relocated 2 km (1.2 mi) away, to the northwest outskirts of the city. This was done under the pretext of combatting an outbreak of cholera, although this justification has been doubted by South Korean historians. The Korean settlers dubbed the area \"Shinkaechŏk-ri\" (lit. 'New Kaechŏk-ri') or \"Shinhanchon\". It was located on top of a small mountain, and was centered on what is now the street Khabarovskaya Ulitsa. Initially, conditions in the enclave were poor, as many constructed and lived in temporary shelters. However, the community soon developed and became more economically stable.\nKorean culture and language continued to flourish in the community. A Korean-language school called Hanmin Hakkyo (한민학교; 韓民學校) was established in March 1912. And while not directly inside of the enclave, local Korean universities such as the Chŏson College of Education (조선사범대학) and Wŏndong Korean College of Education (원동고려사범대) served the community. Korean-language newspapers like Kwŏnŏp Sinmun and Koryo Ilbo were published in Vladivostok for the community. Buildings and infrastructure combined elements of Korean and Russian architecture and planning. For example, houses were often built in the Russian style (as compared to the Korean style), but incorporated ondol heated floors.\nA community organization called the Shinhanchon People's Assembly (신한촌민회; 新韓村民會) represented the community and organized the creation of various services and amenities for Koreans.\n\n\n=== Korean independence movement ===\n\nAround the time of the 1910 annexation of Korea, Shinhanchon served as a hub for the Korean independence movement. Koreans moved to the area in significant quantities. The population in 1911 was 1,500, but by 1915 it was around 10,000.\nThe organization Gwoneophoe was founded on June 1, 1911, in Shinhanchon. On the surface, the group was meant to serve as a regional body for Koreans across Primorskaya Oblast that forwarded agriculture, commerce, industry, and education. However, the group secretly funded and supported the Korean independence movement. It established a provisional government, the Korean Independence Army Government, and gradually began secretly building an army, in part by misusing local government grants, to fight for Korea's liberation.\nThese activities drew the attention of the Empire of Japan, which established a consulate around 1 km away from the enclave. With the rise of World War I in 1914, Russia and Japan established agreements to suppress and extradite Korean independence activists in Vladivostok, which led to the movement being greatly suppressed.\nAfter the March 1st Movement protests in Korea began in 1919, news of the protests reached Shinhanchon by March 8. The news was celebrated, and Koreans there scheduled their own peaceful protest for March 15. However, Russian authorities, under Japanese pressure, declared martial law and ordered that no protests be held. Elsewhere in the province, in Ussuriysk, a protest was held and suppressed on March 17. In support of this, that same day, Koreans in Shinhanchon closed their businesses for the day, and a group of young Koreans distributed translated copies of the Korean Declaration of Independence to the local Japanese consulate, local government buildings, and local consulates beginning around 3 p.m. At 4 p.m., they held a rally and public march that distributed copies of the declaration and eventually made its way downtown by 6 p.m. The rally was suppressed by 7:30 p.m., and many of its members were arrested. Protests continued the following day; Korean workers striked and another rally was held in Shinhanchon.\nIn April 1920, amidst the Russian Civil War and spiking Japan–Bolshevik tensions, Japanese soldiers conducted a massacre of Korean civilians in Shinhanchon in what is now remembered as the \"Shinhanchon Incident\" or \"April Disaster\". It is not known how many were killed, although one estimate puts the number at several hundred. Buildings were burnt down and looted during the raid. In the aftermath of the incident, numerous independence activists fled the enclave, with a number congregating in Shanghai to join the Korean Provisional Government.\nPro-independence sentiment was not uniform in the community. Some Koreans, while not necessarily actively pro-Japanese, saw value in aligning with Japan to improve their living situations. Around the time of the civil war, groups like the Shinhanchon Korean People's Association (신한촌 조선인민회) and Shinhanchon East Village Korean People's Association (신한촌 동촌 조선인민회) formed around these ideologies. These organizations disbanded in late 1922, after the Japanese army withdrew and the Bolsheviks took control of the city.\nThereafter, independence activism was allowed greater freedom by the Soviet Union. On each anniversary of the March 1st Movement, a feast and rally was held. Korean independence activists of the region would attend the event.\n\n\n=== Later history and end ===\nThe community came to an end in 1937, amidst the forced relocation of Koreans to Central Asia. The Korean population of Vladivostok at the time was 7,994 (4,236 men and 3,758 women). Among them, only 3,408 lived in the enclave itself. Afterwards, the community was virtually deserted, and came to be taken over by Russian residents.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe enclave holds an important historical place in both the Korean independence movement and the history of Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans of the mainland former Soviet Union). Important independence activists, such as Ch'ŏe Chae-hyŏng, Yi Dong-hwi, Yi Sang Sul, Hong Beom-do, and Chŏng Sang-chin lived in or were from the enclave. However, few traces of it now remain.\nA gate with red wooden pillars and a sign reading \"Independence Gate\" (독립문) once stood at the entrance of the enclave, but is now lost; only photos of it remain. Today, a small park and Shinhanchon Memorial (신한촌 기념탑) stands near the site of the gate; these were constructed in August 1999 by the Institute of Overseas Korean Affairs (해외한민족연구소). However, the park was noted by a Yonhap News Agency reporter in January 2023 to frequently be locked and inaccessible to visitors. The reporter investigated the issue, and found that the monument had never been properly registered with the government, and that it was unknown who currently managed it. The reporter reached out to the Korean embassy and local Vladivostok government on the issue. After an investigation into the matter, on April 22, the Vladivostok government announced that it would assume ownership over the monument and take charge of its maintenance.\nAt the northern end of the nearby Amur Street is a house with a unique street address \"Seoul Street\" (Сеульская улица; Seul'skaya Ulitsa), that dates from the Shinhanchon period. In 2019, it was reported that a former house of Ch'ŏe Chae-hyŏng at 38 Volodarsky Street was being renovated and turned into a history exhibit.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:Koryo-saram communities\nCategory:Korean communities in Russia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shinhanchon at Wikimedia Commons\n\n* 블라디보스토크 신한촌 on YouTube – A guided tour of many places mentioned in this article (2019; in Korean)",

        "content": "Oom Samie se Winkel (Afrikaans for Uncle Samie's Shop) is a tourist attraction and one of the oldest surviving shops in Stellenbosch, South Africa. It is a known general dealer in Dorp street and is famous for operating almost in exactly the same way as it did in the Victorian era. The store was established in 1904 by Samuel Hannes (or Johannes) Volsteedt, who later became known as \"Oom Samie\", as a general dealer in Stellenbosch. The shop still sells traditional ingredients such as bokkoms, sour fig jam, honey, chest sugar, offal, sheepheads and Rooibos tea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Volsteedt family bought the shop in 1904 for their son, Samuel Volsteedt, who was born in 1879. Samuel had a weak back and was therefore unsuited to do work on their farm. Samuel later began trading as SJ Volsteedt Algemene Handelaar and later became known as ''Oom Samie''.\nOom Samie operated the shop until his death in 1944 and was buried in the Stellenbosch Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Azu Nwagbogu (born 1975) is a Nigerian art curator and National Geographic Explorer at Large. He is the Founder and Director of the African Artists' Foundation, the LagosPhoto Festival and creator of Art Base Africa, an emerging virtual space dedicated to exploring and understanding contemporary African art and diaspora. He was awarded \"Curator of Year\" by the Royal Photographic Society in 2021, and included on the ArtReview list of the 100 most powerful people of the art world in 2021, 2022 and 2023. He will curate Benin's inaugural pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2024.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nAzu Nwagbogu was born in 1975 in Lagos, Nigeria. His higher education includes degrees from the University of Benin in Benin, Nigeria in 1997 and The University of Cambridge in 2005.\nIn 2007, he established The African Artists' Foundation (AAF), a non-profit organization based in Lagos, Nigeria. The African Artists' Foundation promotes African art and its artists through exhibitions, festivals, competitions, residencies, and workshops. The African Artists' Foundation has with the establishment of the National Art Competition in 2008, LagosPhoto Festival in 2010 and its residency program raised international awareness to African creativity.\nWorking as a freelance curator, he has curated exhibitions at institutions globally including 'This is Lagos' at the African Artists' Foundation (2009), 'Dey Your Lane! Lagos Variations' at BOZAR The Centre for Fine Arts (2016), 'Tear my Bra' for the Rencontres d'Arles (2016), 'Samuel Fosso: An African Odyssey' for Photo Espana in Madrid (2018) and 'James Ostrer: Johnny Just Came' at the Gazelli Art House, London (2018). In 2018, he curated the exhibition 'Colomental' at the Staatliche Museen which explored ideas to expand a Museum's scope beyond Western notions and how to incorporate trans-cultural and non-Western artistic tendencies.\nIn 2017, he was appointed Curator at Large of Photography at the Zeitz MOCAA Museum, Cape Town, South Africa. He became Chief Curator the following year and served as Director till 2018. In 2019, he curated the exhibition 'Still Here Tomorrow to High Five You Yesterday', which included work from 40 artists from Africa and its diaspora. The exhibition addressed themes of travel and migration through imagined and alternative realities. That same year, he curated the exhibition 'Why Should I Hesitate: Putting Drawing to Work', which presented the work of artist William Kentridge, including works on view for the first time in South Africa.\nIn 2021, he launched the restitution project 'Searching For Prince Adewale Oyenuga' in Malaga and Lagos. In 2022, Nwagbogu launched the exhibition project, 'Dig Where You Stand, From Coast to Coast (DWYS)' which presented a new model of engagement with questions of decolonization, restitution, and repatriation. The exhibition was first presented at Ibrahim Mahama's Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA) in Tamale, Ghana. The exhibition series explored the regenerative potential of art across the African continent and its diasporas by shifting the decolonial paradigm away from Western museums.\nIn 2022, Azu Nwagbogu was appointed as one of the first curators of Buro Stedelijk, a new platform for contemporary African art based in Amsterdam. In 2023, he was named 'Explorer at Large' by the National Geographic Society, recognizing his commitment to documenting the world's diverse cultures and environments.\nHe was appointed chief curator of Benin's inaugural pavilion at the Venice Biennale by President Patrice Talon. The 2024 pavilion will address questions of restitution with site-specific artworks by artists Romuald Hazoumé, Chloe Quenum, Ishola Akpo and Moufoli Bello. The artworks will explore African feminism and draw on the Gelede which is a ceremony performed by women in tribute to the primordial mother, and a means of celebrating the spiritual and physical roles of women in Yoruba societies. Nwagbogu has explained that the pavilion is an extension of the 2022 exhibition 'The Art of Benin of Yesterday and Today: from Restitution to Revelation', which presented 26 Beninois objects looted by the French army in 1892 but eventually returned to the country by France's Quai Branly Museum. The exhibition included contemporary artworks that responded to the 200-year-old looted objects. Nwagbogu will in a similar way present ways to restitute knowledge through art.\nHe has served on juries, advisory boards, and curatorial teams including the Dutch Doc (2012–15), POPCAP Photography Awards (2012–22), Prisma Photography Award (2015), Greenpeace Photo Award (2016), New York Times Portfolio Review (2017–20), Magnum Photography Award (2017), W.

        "content": "Maad (in Serer, or Mad) is the title given to a male monarch by the Serer people of Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania. In Serer royal history, the Maad possessed supreme power throughout Serer country. The Maad was chosen from the royal lineage and crowned by the great Jaraaf (French: Diaraf) who was equivalent to a prime minister. After his coronation, he would crown a member of his maternal family, usually his mother, sister, maternal aunt, or wife as Lingeer (Queen). The Serer titles Maad a Sinig (King of Sine) and Maad Saloum (King of Saloum) take their names from the radical Serer title Maad, and identifies which part of Serer  country they rule.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nIn Serer, Maad mean king in its simplest definition. When referring to a king, the noun Maad is preceded by \"o\". For example \"o Maad\" (The King). In its historical context, Maad mean one who bears witness or to bear witness–denoting one who judges disputes, usually a king. Such judgments were carried out in public by the Serer kings. When used as a suffix, it identifies someones' noble status or function under the service of the king. For example, the term bii no maad means a noble, member of the royal family, the son of a king - one who got their nobility from their father; maad could also mean chief of a province.\nThe Serer term Maat is sometimes used interchangeably with Maad, but very rarely, and sometimes wrongly. In Serer, the term Maat is usually reserved for the ancient Serer kings whose function was also religious, for example the lamanes. Maat mean the reign of a sovereign, civil administration, and power. However, in its deepest, sacred meaning, it also means “the public thing”, in the highest sense of the term—evoking public order, order in the country, and manifests the natural inclination of the king/Serer man to want to capture the mystical aura that radiates from the Maat.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDiouf, Mame Birame, \"La société sérère: organisation et cosmogonie : essai.\" Éditions Maguilen/Michel Lafon (2008), pp. 129–132, ISBN 9782355620034\nFaye, Souleymane, \"Morphologie du nom sérère: système nominal et alternance consonantique.\" Université de Dakar, Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar, (1985), pp. 4, 7, 40, 70\nReinwald, Brigitte, \"Der Reichtum der Frauen: Leben und Arbeit der weiblichen Bevölkerung in Siin/Senegal unter dem Einfluss der französischen Kolonisation.\"  Volume 9 of Studien zur afrikanischen Geschichte.

        "content": "On 1 April 2024, an Israeli airstrike destroyed the Iranian consulate annex building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, and seven other IRGC officers. Two civilians were killed in the attack. The airstrike took place during a period of heightened tension between Israel and Iran, and amidst the Israel–Hamas war and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict. \nNumerous countries and international organizations condemned the attack. On 13 April 2024, Iran retaliated against the attack with missile and drone strikes in Israel, with Iran claiming it was primarily targeting the bases from which the attack on the consulate was launched.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince 2013 Iran has maintained a presence of its troops in Syria in response to the Syrian civil war, as Syria is a crucial ally of Iran. Additionally, it has been involved in training and funding paramilitary forces from Hezbollah, along with foreign militias from Iraq and Afghanistan, not only in Syria but also in neighboring Lebanon. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah assets within the country. \nWith the onset of the Israel–Hamas war in October 2023, Israel has increased the intensity of its attacks on Syria. From 12 to 22 October 2023, Israel launched at least three attacks on airports in Syria, particularly on Damascus and Aleppo. Notably, Israel carried out the assassination of Razi Mousavi, a senior Iranian general, in the Syrian capital of Damascus on 25 December 2023, and Brigadier General Sadegh Omidzadeh, an intelligence officer with the IRGC Quds Force, on 20 January 2024.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nAccording to Iranian, Syrian, and regional officials, on 1 April 2024, Iranian military commanders convened a \"top-level meeting\" inside Iran's embassy compound in Damascus in the belief that they were protected by \"international norms shielding diplomatic missions\". An Iranian source said that these commanders, which included General Mohammad Reza Zahedi who, according to Iranian officials, was in charge of Iran's covert operation in Syria and Lebanon, were in Damascus to discuss \"operational logistics and coordination\". According to Iranian officials, they were meeting with members from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group active in the Gaza strip.\nThat day, the Iranian consulate annex building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike. Iranian ambassador Hossein Akbari alleged that the consulate building \"was targeted with six missiles from Israeli F-35 warplanes\". The Guardian stated that Israeli warplanes were responsible for the attack. The New York Times (NYT) stated that four Israeli officials anonymously confirmed Israeli responsibility for the attack. Various other media outlets did not definitively attribute the attack to Israel, and the Israeli government refused to comment on the matter.\nThe suspected primary target of the attack was the Quds Force commander of the IRGC, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who was killed in the attack. According to The Guardian, Zahedi was a critical figure in the relationship between Iran and Hezbollah. NYT reported that an anonymous source from the Revolutionary Guards said that the strike targeted a meeting between Iranian intelligence officials and Palestinian militants, including leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who were discussing the war in Gaza.\nFootage and photos from the consulate area after the attack showed extensive damage, fire, and smoke. Iranian media reported that the building had been completely destroyed and that the ambassador and his family, who were housed in the embassy next door, were unharmed.\nThe unused Canadian embassy building on the other side of the consular building was also damaged in the attack, with at least some of its windows destroyed. It has been closed since 2012 because of the Syrian civil war, but it is still owned by the Canadian government.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nSixteen were killed in total, including seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) soldiers, five Iran-backed militiamen, one Hezbollah fighter, one Iranian advisor, and two civilians.\nIn addition to Zahedi, casualties included Zahedi's deputy Brigadier General Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi and five Iranian officials: Hossein Aman Elahi, Sayid Mehdi Jalalati, Ali Agha Babaei, Sayid Ali Salehi Roozbahani, and Mohsen Sedaghat. Zahedi was the most senior IRGC officer to be killed since the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by the U.S. in January 2020.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThis event was the first of its kind since the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.\nThe Guardian's journalists,  Peter Beaumont and Emma Graham-Harrison wrote that the Israeli strike was a miscalculation that had \"bulldozed through every red line to attack a location that Tehran maintains was tantamount to attacking Iranian soil.\"\nSanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the Chatham House think tank stated that the Damascus attack and the “breach” of the Vienna convention was 'the straw that broke the camel’s back.’     \n\n\n=== Legality ===\nDiplomatic premises, like homes and schools, are considered \"civilian objects\" under international law.\nDiplomatic buildings are entitled to further protections from attack or other interference by the host country under international customary law, codified in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Convention on Consular Relations. However, the responsibilities under the Convention only apply to the host country, in this case Syria, with the Convention saying nothing about attacks by third states in foreign countries.\nA UN-commissioned panel of experts on international law consisting of Ben Saul, Morris Tidball-Binz,  Javaid Rehman,  Livingstone Sewanyana, and  Cecilia M. Bailliet wrote that Israel had provided no legal justification for the attack, and had failed to report it to the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, in their view, it violated Article 2(4) banning recourse to force against another state. They also issued a warning that the Israeli officials involved in the strike might have committed crimes. The subsequent Iranian retaliation was also, in their view, prohibited under international law, since self-defense is only justified to deter continuing armed attacks, and the strike on the Iranian Embassy had ended 12 days earlier.\nOthers argue that these rules do not apply to Israel. According to Aurel Sari, a professor of international law at Exeter University, \"unless Israel was able to justify the airstrike as an act of self-defense\" it would be in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. Whether self-defense permits a strike on the territory of a third country is an ongoing legal debate. He argues that as a third state Israel \"is not bound by the law of diplomatic relations with regard to Iran’s Embassy in Syria.\"\nThe US State Department states that \"An attack on an embassy is considered an attack on the country it represents.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== International ===\n\nOfficial entities from many countries condemned the attack and considered it a violation of the international laws, including the Prime Minister of Iraq, the Prime Minister of Spain, the President of Nicaragua, and the foreign ministries of Afghanistan, Algeria, Armenia,  Brazil, Belarus, China, Cuba,  Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania,  Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia (which called it a \"political killing\"), Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sierra Leone,  Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, as well as the Spokesperson for Yemen's Ansar Allah. The Foreign Ministry of Kyrgyzstan expressed concern.\nThe spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General condemned the attack.\nRussia requested the UN Security Council to discuss the strike.  A statement condemning the attack was drafted by Russia to be issued by the Security Council, but the Western member states opposed the issuance of any statement. During the briefing in the United Nations Security Council, the representatives of many countries (such as Ecuador, Guyana, Slovenia, South Korea, and Switzerland) noted that any attack on diplomatic and consular premises violates the Charter of the United Nations as well as the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. They also expressed concern that the incident could further escalate the regional conflict. The representative of Japan only expressed concern, and the representative of the United Kingdom noted the importance of \"respect ... for diplomatic premises\", but also criticized Iran. The spokesman of the United States National Security Council only stated that the US was not involved and had no prior knowledge of the attack. The Representative of Russia criticized the statements made by the US and others including France, considering them to be double standard.\nUnited States officials said Israel had notified the US in advance that it would be operating in Syria, but did not identify the target. A Pentagon spokesperson said Israel had provided no advance warning of the strike.\nThe Arab League, the European Union,\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC),\nas well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) also condemned the attack.\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nThe Israeli military spokesman claimed that the building is neither a consulate nor an embassy, but a military building of Quds forces \"disguised as a civilian structure in Damascus\". Israel told the U.S. that if a retaliatory attack by Iran would prompt a robust response from Israel.\nSeven Israeli embassies were evacuated in response to the potential threat of an Iranian retaliatory attack, after Iran publicly blamed Israel and vowed retaliation. The IDF deployed GPS jamming systems within Tel Aviv to safeguard against potential aerial attacks by Iran. Initial U.S. intelligence anticipated a significant attack on U.S. or Israeli assets as soon as the week of 8–12 April.\n\n\n=== Iran ===\n\nIn several cities across Iran, including the capital, Tehran, as well as Tabriz and Isfahan, large crowds of protesters gathered waving Palestinian and Iranian flags and demanding revenge. The Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed a harsh response to the attack. Khamenei's political advisor Ali Shamkhani, said that the United States remains directly responsible. Iran also sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council, saying it \"reserves its legitimate and inherent right to respond decisively\".  Syria's Foreign Minister condemned the attack, calling it a terrorist attack.\nOn 5 April 2024, Iran told the United States to \"step aside\" as it prepared for retaliation against Israel. On 13 April 2024, the IRGC Navy boarded the Portuguese container ship MSC Aries in the Strait of Hormuz via helicopter. It was redirected to Iranian territory. The MSC Aries is partially owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer and operated by his company, Zodiac Maritime. \nLater, on 13 April 2024, the Iranian military launched an air attack, firing more than 300 standoff weapons at Israel, including at least 170 aerial drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles. The attack, which constituted the largest single drone attack in history, was described as a success by Iran and as a failure by Israel, the latter saying that its air defenses, buttressed by those of allies, destroyed almost all the incoming weapons before they could reach their targets.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1992 Buenos Aires Israeli embassy bombing, Iranian government and Hezbollah found responsible by Argentine court\n1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires (85 dead), part of Iran–Israel proxy conflict\n2020 Assassination of Qasem Soleimani by the USA\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Aigejang Shooting, otherwise known as the Aigejang Massacre, occurred on 13 June 2023, when Kuki assailants, either volunteers or militants, launched an attack on a group of Meitei men, suspected to be militants or mob members, inside a church on the outskirts of the Kuki village of Aigejang in the Khamenlok area of Kangpokpi, Manipur.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Manipur violence ===\nAs part of the 2023-2024 Manipur violence, dozens of violent incidents had occurred in Kangpokpi District prior to the events in Aigejang. However, Aigejang itself, despite being a border village between the two communities, had not seen significant violence by the start of June 2023, despite escalating tensions between communities in the region. The area had, in the past days, seen an influx of people from other parts of the state, specifically Meitei volunteers claiming to \"defend\" the Meitei-dominated parts. On June 12, 2023, an adjacent village to Aigejang had been burnt down by these volunteers.\n\n\n=== Attack on Aigejang ===\nOn 13 June 2023, starting at around 6 PM, thousands of armed Meitei assailants, including UNLF cadres, began to move into Kuki villages, burning down eight villages in the lower foothills in a short amount of time. They also reportedly burned down houses at the Kuki village of Aigejang in Kangpokpi, Manipur. Kuki village chiefs alleged that state police and IRB personnel aided the Meitei assailants, although the validity of these claims remains uncertain. Security personnel from Assam Rifles and the Indian Army dispatched to the area were reportedly blocked by hundreds of Meira Paibis at Chanung. Following the attack, the mob occupied parts of the outskirts of the village.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe same day, unidentified Kuki assailants, attacked a group of Meitei men with gunfire and bombs while they were resting inside a church on the outskirts of Aigejang in the Khamenlok area of Kangpokpi, Manipur. It is suspected that the Meitei individuals attacked were part of the aforementioned mob. The exchange resulted in the death of at least 11 Meitei individuals, with 23 others sustaining injuries. Additionally, three Meitei individuals were abducted by the Kuki assailants, who claimed to have subsequently killed them. The motive is generally considered to have been revenge for the burning of Aigejang and to clear the region of Meitei assailants.\nThe victims claimed that they had went to deliver food to the Meitei assailants, and that they were told to stay inside the church by the militants as it had been raining, before they were suddenly fired upon. They denied being combatants and claimed that the armed volunteers were too far away to have put up any resistance.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn December 25 of that same year, an unidentified armed group detonated bombs within the village, injuring a Indian Ghorka man. The reasons for the detonations are unknown but are thought to be linked to the ongoing violence in the state.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lieutenant general Hassan Pasha al-Iskandarani (Egyptian Arabic: حسن باشا الإسكندراني), born Zakaria, (1790 – 1854) was an Egyptian Navy commander who participated in the Battle of Navarino and the Crimean War.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nZakaria, an Egyptian of Circassian origin, was born in 1790 in the city of Angasia (أنجاسيا) in the northern Circassian lands, close to the Black Sea. He was the third and last child of Imam Hassan, head of the Shruisheen tribe (قبيلة الشرويشيين). He came to Egypt when his father decided to perform the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca), and he intended to send his son to receive his education at al-Azhar in 1800, and his son was not more than 10 years old, when they arrived in Egypt, his father left him with one of his friends from the Selahdariya Mamluks until he returned, but death struck his father while he was on his way from Mecca to Medina, so Zakaria became an orphan.\nZakaria grew up in the care of his father's friend, and he worked with him in the manufacture of weapons. As fate would have it, he was commissioned by the wāli of Egypt, Mahammad Ali Pasha, in mid 1811 to manufacture a quantity of weapons to be used in a military campaign to suppress the Wahhabi revolution in the Arabian Peninsula. When he completed making them, he carried them with Zakaria to the Uzbekiya Palace, where Mahammad Ali met them, and the wāli's eyes fell on Hassan. He was so impressed by his boldness and deeds that he embraced him with compassion and used him in his diwan, so Zakaria abandoned his old name and preferred to give himself the name of his father, Hassan.\nMahammad Ali had begun his first attempts to form the Egyptian army. Hassan responded well to the call and joined the army in the infantry, however, when he traveled in early September 1811 with Mahammad Ali Pasha to Suez and saw the nucleus of the Egyptian fleet sailing from its port to transport men and equipment to the Arabian Peninsula, Hassan - a native of the coast - realized that the waves of the sea were calling to him, so he prepared himself to enter the navy. After years he left the infantry to join the Egyptian naval mission in 1818 to the port of Toulon in France. He studied naval arts and mathematics, mastered the French language, and trained in the Toulon arsenal. After graduating from the French Naval School, he returned to Egypt.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter Hassan al-Iskandarani returned from France in 1825, when he was thirty-seven years old, he joined the Egyptian fleet, and was appointed to the rank of naval lieutenant. He demonstrated his competence and skill, and participated in the naval battle of Navarino, which ended with the destruction of the Egyptian and Ottoman fleets.\nHassan was commanding the frigate “Al-Ihsaniyya” (الإحسانية), while Muharram Bey, commander of the Egyptian fleet, held his banner on the frigate “Jihadiya” (جهادية). Fire broke out on Hassan al-Iskandarani's ship during the battle, and soon its masts, bulwarks, and other parts were ignited until it exploded and shook the entire surrounding due to its sound. Its commander refused to witness for himself the deportation of his men from it, facing the gravest dangers, until a bomb fell next to him and its fragments hit him in the face. Then another bomb followed, throwing him unconscious into the sea. Had it not been for the vigilance of his faithful Nubian servant, Faraj, who dived into the sea behind him and treated him immediately, he would not have been destined to survive.\nThe Navarino disaster did not waste the effort of Mahammad Ali Pasha and did not discourage him, so he began building ships and refining the resolve of the men until the Egyptian fleet - after the defeat of Navarino - ranked third among the fleets of countries.\nOn August 1, 1828, Mahammad Ali alone signed an agreement with the allies to evacuate the Egyptian army from Morea, specifying the manner of evacuation, considering that this was an act of Egyptian sovereignty, which aroused the ire of the Ottoman Sultan, the sovereign of Egypt, as a result of the ability and competence demonstrated by the Egyptian army on the battlefield in the Morea War, which made the allied countries negotiate directly with the governor of Egypt without the mediation of the Ottoman Empire, and Mahammad Ali began to take independent positions that overlooked the Ottoman Sultan, and began to dispute with him by trying to separate Egypt from the Ottoman Empire.\nIn early 1831, Turkish threats and intrigues against Egypt were renewed. As a result, Mahammad Ali marched the Egyptian army overland in October, and in November units of the Egyptian fleet sailed from Alexandria, and Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa, belonging to the Ottoman Sultanate, were handed over to him without a fight. On December 8, Mahammad Ali sent The frigate “Shir Jihad” (شير جهاد) led by Hassan al-Iskandarani, with the Egyptian fleet led by Othman Nour al-Din Pasha, the Nazir al-Bahria (Navy minister), participated in demolishing the fortress of Acre and eliminating its pro-Turkish governor. Then in 1832, he headed to the islands of the Greek archipelago and eliminated the pirate operations until Mahammad Ali Pasha summoned him in early October and entrusted him with the command of Frigate No. 4, perhaps called “Abu Qir” (أبو قير). Most of the Egyptian fleet headed back to Alexandria, and light units remained to monitor the movements of the Turks.\nHassan al-Iskandarani was granted the title of Amir al-Bihar “Prince of the Seas” as a reward for him. Mahammad Ali had settled on marrying Hassan al-Iskandarani to one of the palace girls called Eltifat bint al-Ghoz. Hassan al-Iskandarani continued to board one ship after another, until Mahammad Ali appointed him second commander of the Egyptian fleet in 1833, and the arsenal and shipyards belonged to the authority of Hassan al-Iskandarani, and were subject to his direct supervision. He sent a number of Egyptian workers, engineers, and officers on missions to the ports of France to learn shipbuilding, and when they returned, he dispensed with most of the foreigners who were working in building them.\n\n\n== Minister of Navy ==\nIn May 1837, al-Iskandarani was appointed Nazir (Minister) of the Navy, and Mahammad Ali Pasha granted him the rank of “Pasha.” In November 1838, the Egyptian fleet, thanks to Hassan al-Iskandarani, was at the forefront of the world's fleets after the fleets of the United Kingdom and France.\n\n\n== Leading the fleet in Crimea ==\nWith Abbas Pasha I assuming the rule of Egypt in November 1848, and with the Ottomans requesting Abbas I to help them in their war against Russia, Abbas Pasha ordered the naval commander, Hassan al-Iskandarani, to prepare the Egyptian fleet to participate in this war, which was known as the Crimean War.\nHassan Pasha equipped, reorganized, and renovated the fleet. The strength of that fleet was 12 warships, equipped with 642 cannons, and 6,850 naval soldiers.\nHe traveled at the head of the Egyptian fleet to Turkey in 1853. The arrival of the Egyptian fleet to Turkey caused a shock of joy and excitement, and the Turkish authorities welcomed them. After the killing of Abbas I in his palace in Banha, July 1854, and after him Sa'id Pasha took office, the battles at Sevastopol had intensified on land and at sea and in some of the Crimean lands, the English and French suffered heavy losses, and the Egyptians suffered hardships and horrors due to the extreme cold, and many of them died.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn October 31, 1854, upon the return of Hassan Pasha al-Iskandarani, the commander of the fleet, at the head of his fleet, to Istanbul, to repair some ships, stormy winds in the Black Sea blew over it, and fog multiplied over it, which led to the ship “Moftah Jihad” (مفتاح جهاد), on which the commander of the naval army, Hassan al-Iskandarani, was located, colliding with rocks of the Black Sea, so the ship sank, and he and 1,920 Egyptian marines drowned. They contributed to the Russians losing a near-global war, and only 130 survived the sinking.\nThe Crimean War ended with the victory of the Ottomans and their allies, Egypt, UK, and France, over the Russians, and peace was concluded at the Paris Conference on March 30, 1856. The narrators, commanders of the allied armies, and the commander-in-chief of the allied armies unanimously agreed that the Egyptian soldiers raised their status in the eyes of everyone through their dedication, bravery, intensity of their struggle against the Russians, and their superiority on the Turkish army.\n\n\n== Honoring ==\nThe writer Esmat al-Iskandarani, the granddaughter of Hassan al-Iskandarani, revived her grandfather's military history. She published books in Arabic and French, praising Egypt's maritime glories, and gifted them to the Egyptian Navy. She also donated her house in Ras El-Tin to the Navy to be a nautical club, and she donated all of her property, including real estate, agricultural land, and money, to the Naval College, so she was nicknamed “Om al-Bahria\" (Mother of the Navy), as she was able to enter the headquarters of the Naval Forces at any time, and board any battleship or armored vehicle without being obstructed by any obstacles. The late President Gamal Abdel Nasser presented her with the “Golden Perfection” Medal in 1955.\nThere is a street in Alexandria carrying his name.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Dude Wipes 250 was the 7th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 17th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, April 6, 2024, at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia, a 0.526 miles (0.847 km) permanent asphalt paperclip-shaped short track. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 250 laps, but was increased to 251 laps due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a wild and action packed race that saw numerous spins and wrecks, Aric Almirola, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would survive a chaotic overtime restart, and won the race after a multi-car incident occurred on the final lap with him in the lead. This was Almirola's fifth career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his first of the season. Almirola was the most consistent driver of the race, winning the first stage and leading a race-high 148 laps. To fill out the podium, Sam Mayer, driving for JR Motorsports, and Chandler Smith, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\nThis was also the first race of the Dash 4 Cash. Drivers eligible for the Dash 4 Cash were Chandler Smith, Aric Almirola, Jesse Love, and Parker Kligerman, since they were the highest finishing Xfinity regulars following the race at Richmond. Almirola would claim the bonus cash after winning the race.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nMartinsville Speedway is an NASCAR-owned stock car racing track located in Henry County, in Ridgeway, Virginia, just to the south of Martinsville. At 0.526 miles (0.847 km) in length, it is the shortest track in the NASCAR Cup Series. The track was also one of the first paved oval tracks in NASCAR, being built in 1947 by H. Clay Earles. It is also the only remaining race track on the NASCAR circuit since its beginning in 1948.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nPractice was held on Friday, April 5, at 5:05 PM EST. Since Martinsville Speedway is a short track, drivers will be split into two groups, Group A and B, with both sessions being 15 minutes long. A. J. Allmendinger, driving for Kaulig Racing, was the fastest driver between both groups, with a lap of 20.172, and a speed of 93.873 mph (151.074 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Friday, April 5, at 5:40 PM EST. Since Martinsville Speedway is a short track, the qualifying system used is a single-car, two-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have two laps to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.Brandon Jones, driving for JR Motorsports, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 19.694, and a speed of 96.151 mph (154.740 km/h).Ryan Vargas was the only driver who failed to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 60\n\nStage 2 Laps: 60\n\nStage 3 Laps: 131\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He father, Hadden Royden Todd (1910–1944), was an officer in the Royal Artillery who was killed during the Battle of Normandy. Her mother, Louisa May \"Wendy\" Todd (née Robins; 1914–1991), \"came from a wealthy family linked to the Bibby Line shipping company\". Her mother remarried after the war, first briefly to a New Zealander, and then to Henry George Villiers Greer, a Northern Irishman who had been a prisoner of war in Burma. She grew up in Shropshire and was educated at Overstone School, an all-girls independent boarding school in Northampton.\nShe left school at 16 and began to travel through Europe. She spent time in Paris, France, where she learnt French, and then in Florence, Italy, where she studied studied and worked at the Hotel Savoy. She returned to England, became a débutante and was featured on the cover of Queen magazine. Among here suitors was Anthony Armstrong Jones, later husband of Princess Margaret, but she fell in love with Angus Malcolm Wolfe Murray (born 1937), a journalist at The Yorkshire Post. Rather than be allowed to marry the \"penniless journalist\", her mother sent her to New York. However, upon Stephanie's return, she still wished to marry Wolfe Murray and was only allowed to do so when he made it known that he had titled relatives: his maternal grandfather was Patrick Boyle, 8th Earl of Glasgow. They married on 11 November 1961 at the Church of St Michael & Our Lady, Wragby. The couple lived at Braulen Lodge in Strathfarrar, Scotland, and soon had four sons.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born while his father was competing with Brazil at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and so his father first saw him in the form of a photograph sent while he was travelling with the squad.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nAdriano took an interest in football after his father, and began his career with a Barcelona-affiliated academy in Rio de Janeiro. He was playing for Boavista before a move to Grêmio in April 2021. He marked his debut for Grêmio's under-15 side in June 2021 with a goal. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Adriano found his opportunities at the club limited, and he was left off Grêmio's sixteen-player squad list for the Nike Cup.\nFollowing his departure from Grêmio in December 2021, he joined the academy of Serrano in early 2022. He made headlines in Brazil for his goal-scoring ability while with Serrano, and was invited to trial with Danish side Esbjerg in October 2022. Despite this, he remained with Serrano, signing a professional contract in April 2023 - a deal running through December 2026.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goolam Hossen, alias Piperdy (circa 1820 – 1875) was a notable Mauritian trader and entrepreneur, recognized for his pivotal involvement in facilitating the migration and commercial activities of South Gujarat Muslim merchants and traders from Surat to the British colony of Mauritius during the 19th century. His endeavors significantly influenced the development of commerce and industry within the burgeoning British territory of Mauritius.\n\n\n== Migration ==\nThe migration of South Gujarat Muslim merchants and traders from the hinterland of the bustling port city of Surat to Mauritius commenced in the 1830s. This initial wave was primarily motivated by the lucrative prospects in textiles and commodities trade. It wasn't until the 1850s that the migration and subsequent settlement of Gujarati Sunnee Vohras, colloquially referred to as 'marchands Arabes,' gained momentum. These enterprising individuals became a common sight in the Central Business District of eighteenth-century Port Louis, particularly along the streets of Corderie and Desforges, which would later be known as Surtee Bazaar.\nGoolam Hossen was the second migrant to arrive in Mauritius from Surat. Establishing himself as a \"Surtee\" merchant, he played a pivotal role in the economic landscape and Indian community of Mauritius. His first son, Ajum, was born around 1850 in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, who continued Goolam's legacy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGoolam Hossen's arrival in Mauritius during the 1850s, following Bahemia, coincided with the migration of other South Gujarat Muslim merchants and traders from Surat, marking the inception of significant commercial activities in the region. The family firm of Piperdy, part of the bigger Piperdy of Rander, registered in Mauritius as Goolam Hossen & Co., became known in the mid-late 19th century under his leadership.\nGoolam Hossen's astute business acumen played a vital role in kickstarting the commerce and industry of Mauritius. Goolam Hossen & Co. expanded its operations to encompass a wide array of sectors including wholesale and retail trade, import and export, shipping, and real estate.<\nThe firm's reach extended beyond the shores of Mauritius, with trading centers established in strategic locations such as Burma, Singapore, and the Arabian peninsula. Goolam Hossen & Co. primarily dealt in commodities such as foodstuffs, textiles, and timber, reflecting the prevailing trade patterns of the era.\nLike many Indian merchants of the time, the Piperdy family, owners of Goolam Hossen & Co., were heavily involved in the real estate business.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Goolam Hossen's death in 1875, the company was passed down to his son Ajum, who then renamed it Ajum Goolam Hossen & Co.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGujarati Muslims\nSunni Bohra\nAjum Goolam Hossen\n\n\n== References ==",

The company serves wholesale distributors in the plumbing, heating, HVAC, fire protection, electrical and other industries from their distribution centers across United States. Products sold include steel pipe, copper tubing, PVC pipe, electrical conduit, strut channel and threaded rod.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnited Pipe & Steel was founded by David Cohen in Everett, Massachusetts, in 1980. Morgenthaler, a private equity firm, acquired the company in 2013.\nIn 2019 United Pipe & Steel was acquired by One Equity Partners,  and operationally integrated with Merfish Pipe & Supply, a master distributor based in Houston, Texas. In 2020, both companies were merged and renamed Merfish United.\nIn 2021 Reliance, Inc. acquired the company, and it was renamed back to United Pipe & Steel in 2023, with an updated brandmark.\n\n\n== Business model ==\nUnited Pipe operates a fleet of semi-trailer trucks and flatbed trailers, delivering less-than-truckload orders of pipe to wholesale distributors in the industries served. This model, known as master distribution, supports the supply chain by allowing suppliers to make smaller purchases and replenish their inventories more quickly. By allowing distributors to mix and match products, low minimum order weights can be easily met for free freight allowed on regular, weekly truck delivery routes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Croner (1656–1740) was a Transylvanian composer and organist of Saxon descent. He is best known for his four manuscript collections of organ music, his  'Tablaturae', that include some of the earliest surviving organ compositions from this region.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDaniel Croner was born in Kronstadt (now Brașov) to master tailor Daniel Croner and his wife Katharina at their home in Purzengasse. His musical talent was recognized early and encouraged.\n\n\n== Eduation ==\nFrom 1671 to 1678 he attended Kronstadt's Honterus-Gymnasium. In 1675 he began to make copies of music for his own use. He then moved to Weissenburg (now Alba Iulia) to perfect his knowledge of Hungarian and moved to Breslau (now Wrocław) in 1680 to study at the Maria Magdalena High School.\nLater that year Croner enrolled at the university in Leipzig. It seems he was unprepared for the cost of his studies in Leipzig and he transferred to Wittenberg to study theology. Here he got to know the local cantor Johann Ulich (1634–1712). When Corner left Wittenberg in 1683 Ulrich dedicated a printed “Musical Ode” to him.\n\n\n== Adult life ==\nIn January 1684 Daniel Croner returned to Kronstadt and by the spring of 1685 he'd copied almost a hundred preludes and fugues into his - by now - four manuscript volunes of music, of which around twenty items are his own works.\nIn 1687 Croner married and in 1691 he was appointed 'preacher' at Kronstadt's St. John's Church. In 1693 he was appointed 'preacher' at the city parish church, known as the Schwarze Kirche\" (Black Church).\nIn 1701, the community of nearby Heldsdorf (now Hălchiu) in Burzenland (now Țara Bârsei) elected him as their pastor. From 1704 he resumed adding to his manuscript music collection. In 1709 he oversaw the purchase of new organ for the Heldsdorf church. From 1735 to 1738 he was the Area Dean of the Burzenland churches. He died on April 25, 1740, in Heldsdorf and was buried in the church there.\n\n\n== Works ==\nCroner's magnum opus is his 'Tablaturae', comprising four manuscript volumes of organ music - fugues, preludes, toccatas, fantasias and chorales - all written in tablature and preserved in the library of the Black Church.\n\nKronstadt, 1675\nBreslau, 1681 (Tabulatura, Fugarum, Praeludiorum, Canzonarum, Tocatarum et Phanrasiarum.\nWittenberg, May 1682 (Tabulatura Num: 12 Praeambulorum mit einem Capriccio von eben 12 Variationen; durch alle Claves und Tonos auff Clavichordien und Spinetten zu gebrauchen, gesetzt von Johann George Kittelen, Weitberiihmbten Churf. Hoff-Organisten in Dresden.\nKronstadt, 1685\nIn his collection Croner not only displays his grasp of traditional styles - not least by including alongside his own compositions the works of older contemporaries such as Johann Froberger, Johann Erasmus Kindermann, Johann Christian Kittel, Bernhard Meyer and Johann Ulich - but also his own lively innovatory spirit. In these volumes Croner marks the transition from an earlier polyphonic style to the new styles of the High Baroque. Of particular note was his organisation of works into complete cycles of keys (such as we find later in J.S. Bach's Das wohltemperirte Klavier). Other notable characteristics include: -  rhythmic variations of choral themes; - the increased use of keys rather than church modes; - and the frequent introduction of the pedal.  Croner was a pioneer in the inclusion of instructions for fingering methods on keyboard instruments and the finger extension principle for the execution of preludes and capriccios.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublic domain scores  by Daniel Corner in the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) / Petrucci Music Library.

        "content": "Damián van der Vaart (born 28 May 2006) is a Dutch footballer currently playing as a midfielder for Ajax.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nVan der Vaart was born in the Dutch municipality of Zaanstad to former Dutch international footballer Rafael van der Vaart and Dutch television personality and model Sylvie Meis. Following his parent's separation in 2013, he remained in Germany with his mother.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nFollowing his father's move from London-based club Tottenham Hotspur to German side Hamburger SV in 2012, van der Vaart joined the academy of fellow Hamburg-based club SC Victoria. During his time with SC Victoria, the club was sponsored by his mother's company, Meis Enterprise.\nIn July 2020, van der Vaart moved to Denmark to live with his father, joining the academy of Esbjerg - the last club his father had played for, and the club his father's new partner, Estavana Polman, played handball for. A year after joining the Danish 1st Division side, on his fifteenth birthday in May 2021, he signed a new contract, keeping him with the club until 2023. He made his unofficial debut for the club in February 2022, while his father was a member of the coaching staff.\nOn 6 September 2023, van der Vaart joined another of his father's former clubs, returning to the Netherlands to join Ajax on a free transfer, with a compensation fee being agreed between Ajax and Esbjerg. He had trialled with the Eredivisie side three months prior, and on signing a one-year deal, he stated: \"I am very happy. It was always a dream of mine to play for Ajax.\"\n\n\n== International career ==\nBorn in the Netherlands, van der Vaart is eligible to represent the Netherlands and Indonesia at international level, due to his mother's Dutch East Indies heritage. He made his debut for the Netherlands under-17 Futures side, composed of players not yet eligible to represent the full under-17 squad, in a 2–2 friendly draw against Luxembourg in February 2023, before going on to also feature in a 2–0 loss to Belgium.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 25 January 2024, a Batik Air Airbus A320-200, flying from Haluoleo Airport, Indonesia to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Indonesia was involved in an incident where the airplane was not controlled by any crew members for almost 30 minutes because both crew members were sleeping. The incident resulted in the suspension of both pilots licenses.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe incident aircraft was a 7 year old Airbus A320-200, with registration PK-LUV, and MSN 7673. It has been owned and operated by Batik Air, a 11-year old Indonesian airline since it was first sold.\n\n\n== Crew ==\nThe captain was a 32 years old Indonesian who had an Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL) and qualified was as Airbus A320 pilot, with a total flying time of 6,304 hours 11 minutes.\nThe first officer was 28 years old, Indonesian who had a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) and qualified as Airbus A320 pilot. The first officer had a total flight time of 1,664 hours 45 minutes. He had been off duty for the two days before the flight. He spent that time moving to a new house, as he and his wife had one month old twins. He went to sleep at 19:00 local time on 24 January, but his sleep was interrupted multiple times to care for his twins. At 00:00 25 January, the SIC awoke to begin his duty day.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nDuring the flight preparation before the flight from the first flight from Jakarta, the first officer told the captain that he didn't have much rest. The aircraft took off from Jakarta and landed at Kendari without any problems other than getting delayed by about 30 minutes because of the weather. During this flight, the first officer got to have some rest during cruising.\nOnce everyone was off of the first flight and people finished boarding the second flight back to Jakarta Airport from Kendari Airport, the flight pushed back, taxied, and took off. The aircraft then ascended to their cruising altitude and now, the captain asked to get rest from the first officer and the permission was granted. Then, after about an hour, the first officer inadvertently fell asleep, and there was no one at the controls. 12 minutes later, Jakarta ACC asked Flight 6723 how long the aircraft needed to fly on the current heading, there was no response. Several attempts were made to try to contact Flight 6723 but there was no reply. The aircraft kept flying straight for 28 minutes and 210 nautical miles, well off of their flight plan, until the captain woke up and realized that they were not on the correct route. Then the captain saw the first officer sleeping and woke him up. The flight turned around and then successfully landed at Jakarta International Airport uneventfully.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the aftermath of the incident, there was no damage to the plane or any injuries but both of the pilots involved in this incident were suspended from flying.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) are investigating this incident and have released the Preliminary Report, it states all the facts gathered by the NTSC and gives recommendations. In response to the investigation results and recommendations from NTSC, Batik Air expressed its commitment to implementing all safety recommendations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard Louis \"Rich\" Trumka Jr. (born 1984 or 1985) is an American lawyer and government official. He is currently a member of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, serving since December 2021.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nTrumka was born c. 1984 as the only child of prominent labor leader Richard Trumka and his wife, Barbara Vidovich Trumka. He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University and his Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University Law Center.Early in his career, Trumka worked as an assistant attorney general in the consumer protection division of the Office of the Maryland Attorney General. In 2019, he became general counsel and staff director of the Economic and Consumer Policy Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, where he led investigations into teenage use of e-cigarettes and the presence of toxic heavy metals in baby food.\n\n\n== Consumer Product Safety Commission ==\nTrumka was nominated to a seven-year term on the CPSC by President Joe Biden in July 2021. His nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in November of that year and he took office on December 2, 2021. On the commission, Trumka worked to pass child safety rule, including rules related to pull cords of window coverings and the prevention of swallowing magnets.\n\n\n=== Gas stove controversy ===\nIn December 2022, Trumka triggered a political controversy over the use and regulation of gas stoves. During a virtual event, Trumka said that the CPSC would issue a request for information on hazards, particularly related to indoor air quality, of the appliances. \"This public request for information is the first step in what could be a long journey toward regulating gas stoves,\" Trumka said, according to The Hill, adding that \"We could get a regulation on the books before this time next year.\" According to The Hill, Trumka also said that an \"outright ban\" on new gas stoves was \"a real possibility.\" In a January 2023 interview with Bloomberg, Trumka described gas stoves as \"a hidden hazard,\" adding that \"[a]ny option is on the table. Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.\"Many political people and institutions on the right and center—including Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia); Reps. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), Jim Jordan, and Gary Palmer (R-Alabama); Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; Fox News personalities Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson; and the Heritage Foundation—as well as the American Gas Association took issue with Trumka's comments and the proposal that the CPSC take action up and including a ban on gas stoves. On Twitter, Manchin described it as \"a recipe for disaster. The federal government has no business telling American families how to cook their dinner. I can tell you the last thing that would ever leave my house is the gas stove that we cook on.\" Natural gas analyst Steve Everley published an analysis challenging the design of the study most commonly cited about the dangers of gas stoves.To quell the controversy, CPSC Chairman Alexander Hoehn-Saric issued a statement that \"I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so,\" and the White House issued a statement that President Biden \"does not support banning gas stoves – and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves.\" Subsequent news reports indicated that the CPSC might pursue so-called compromises, including requiring hoods for all gas stoves, setting performance standards for hoods or requiring that gas stoves have sensors for certain pollutant concentrations. Later in 2023, the House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced legislation (H.R. 1615) that would bar the CPSC from using taxpayer funds for a gas stove ban; the bill cleared the committee with bipartisan support.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nTrumka is married and has two young children. In July 2022, he accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom that Biden conferred posthumously on his late father. His hobbies include woodworking.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCPSC profile",

Had these parties entered the election in an alliance, their hypothetical joint candidate would have won over 65% of the vote.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The battle of Ulhówek and Rzeczyca or the Ulhówek-Rzeczyca offensive were battles fought from the 1st to the 2nd of June 1944 in the outskirts in the villages of Ulhówek and Rzeczyca. The battles of Ulhówek and Rzeczyca was the largest battle between Polish and Ukrainian guerillas in the Lublin Voivodeship during World War II as part of the Polish–Ukrainian ethnic conflict.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1943, Polish partisans fearing that the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's terror would spread into the Lublin Voivodeship started attacking local Ukrainian activists, however these were not mass crimes, but executions carried out on designated individuals. In response Ukrainian police units started pacification of Polish villages and Polish partisans started pacification of Ukrainian villages turning into a Vicious circle. The conflict in 1943 in the region lead to the execution of 456 Ukrainians, 286 of whom were, in Bozyk's words, 'nationally aware peasants'. The remaining group included Orthodox priests, Ukrainian national activists and  officers of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police.\nIn March 1944 the Home Army and Peasant Battalions led by Zenon Jachymek and Stanisław Basaj started the largest anti-Ukrainian action of the Polish Underground State named the Hrubieszów revolution, the result of the event was the killing of approximately 2,000 Ukrainians.\nIn April of the same year the UPA started a major offensive against Polish partisans however the first offensive on the 5th of April failed, and the offensive on the first day of Easter had an Inconclusive outcome. Due to the failed offensives only sporadic attacks took place until the 15h of May when the UPA organized an offensive in the area of Nabrozh, Telatyn and Zulice. Telatyn changed hands several times. Fearing encirclement, the Polish troops had to withdraw across the Huczwa River from Nabróża. On May 21 the UPA tried to attack Narol however the attack failed and UPA soldiers had to go back to their positions.\n\n\n=== Polish forces ===\nOn 1 June 1944, Polish units began preparing for an attack on the approximately fifty-kilometre-long Tyszowce - Łaszczów - Jarczów section. Its aim was to pre-empt the actions of the UPA units. The main strike was to be directed at Ulhówek and Rzeczyca, which were key points in the UPA's positions. Nine groupings were formed:\n\n1st Group under the command of Marian Pilarski \"Grom\" - 550 soldiers\n2nd Group under the command of Andrzej Dżygała \"Korczak\", composed of 6 units with 600 soldiers counting 40 Uhlans led by Franciszek Korczyński. It's task was to take positions for an attack in the Rachaj forest near Posadow, then to capture Rokitno from the north towards Ulhówek.\n3rd Group under the command of Tadeusz Niedziałkowski \"Tomasz\", composed of 5 units and 450 soldiers. It's task was to capture the villages of Podlodów and Żerniki, then launch an attack from the northwest on Ulhówek, and cooperate with the 4th Group.\n4th Group under the command of Franciszek Bednarski \"Reneta\", composed of  5 units and 450 soldiers. It's task was after capturing the village of Rzeczyca, to continue the attack on Ulhówek from the west.\n5th Group under the command of Józef Kozak \"Waręż\", composed of 1 company, 150 soldiers. It's task was to advance the attack on the Dębina manor, capture the road, and occupy positions to support the fighting groups.\n6th Group uder the command of  Błażej Czop \"Czapliński\", with 250 soldiers it's task was to take up a starting position for an attack east of the village of Nedeżów towards Łubcze, Szlatyn, and Hubinek.\n7th Group under the command of Bronisław Wojciechowski \"Czarny\", it's task was to operate east of the Łubcze colony towards Chodywańce.\n8th Group under the command of Bronisław Bochenek \"Głaz\", it's task was to occupy the Rochaj Posadów-Steniatyn forest on the night of June 1–2 as a starting position for the attack on Ulhówek and Rokitno.\n9th Group under the command of Franciszek Samulak \"Młot\".\nIn total, the Home Army forces mobilised for this action amounted to 3,000 men. The entire offensive was commanded by Captain Zenon Jachymek \"Wiktor\".\n\n\n== The offensive ==\nOn 1 June 1944, the individual groups took up a starting posture for an attack, the units of the 1st Group left the Tyszowiec Forest for the designated positions with the task of securing the Polish offensive near Ulhówek from the north. On the morning of 2 June the grouping started to develop for the attack from Dabrowa forest in order to drive out the UPA soldiers. Lieutenant \"Ryszard\"'s \"Wiklina\" company was to tie up the UPA garrison in Stara Wieś with a part of its forces, while \"Grom\" company was in reserve.Its platoon was to capture the strategically important road Mircze-Stara Wieś-Telatyn-Ulhówek, in order to prevent the enemy from receiving reinforcements from the Mircze region. The unit's attempt to capture Dąbrowa failed because the \"Kozak\" unit unexpectedly encountered a 12-man SS \"Galizien\" sub-unit training in the forest, which was completely destroyed. The attack by \"Czarny\" and \"Kozak\" on Dąbrowa collapsed under the hurricane fire of a strong Wehrmacht front unit that had previously occupied Dąbrowa. During the heavy fighting with the attacking enemy, \"Kozak\" and \"Czarny\" suffered heavy wounds. With the help of the \"Czarny\" and \"Kozak\" squads came the company of Lt.  Konopy, \"Czaruś\". The battle, which lasted more than two hours, was inconclusive. The fighting at Dąbrowa was paid with the loss of 4 killed and 3 wounded.\nThe grouping of the II sergeant senior A. Dżygało, \"Korczak\", while marching to their starting positions in the Zulice forest, accidentally encountered in the area of Zulice a Ukrainian unit providing cover for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's grouping in Telatin. As a result of the unexpected shelling of the \"Korczak\" unit, nurse Stefania Gajewska, \"Rosa\", was killed. The third company of the lieutenant, \"Muryna\" insuring the action of Korczak's troops, after a short battle, drove back the Ukrainian unit to Telatyn and moved to capture Posadów, Rzeplin and the surrounding forests. The 2nd Group was quickly recognised by the enemy, which had a detrimental effect on the course and conduct of the entire action; moreover, \"Korczak\" halted the march of his units to the starting positions and moved to the Żulice forest. The \"Muryna\" company occupied the village of Posadów and continued the fight with the Ukrainians for the hill near Rzeplin. At this time, the horse reconnaissance of the Korczyński cavalry group, in the strength of 96 Uhlans, attacked Rokitno, which, after some support from \"Muryna\"'s soldiers, was captured.\nA part of the \"Korczak\" detachment, stationed idly in the forest, moved at about 9.30 a.m. to support the remaining forces of the 2nd Platoon. From 11 p.m. the \"Reneta\" assault group of Lieutenant Fr. Bednarski was engaged in the battle. The 3rd group of rtm. Tadeusz Niedziałkowski, \"Tomasz\", with whom the commander of the group, Cpt. \"Wiktor\", was located, captured Podlody and took Żerniki. However, the sounds of the battle could not be heard from the Steniatyn Forest.\nAt this time, Lt. \"Reneta\" renewed the attack with his 4th grouping from the west on Rzeczyca. The Ukrainian command directed more and more troops to Rzeczyca to reinforce the defence. The attack of Lieutenant \"Reneta\" collapsed under heavy Ukrainian fire. To the relief of the retreating Reneta's units came Capt. T. Niedziałkowski, \"Tomasz\", who, aware of the situation on the battlefield, left Bela's company and with part of his forces struck in the direction of \"Ulhówka. A joint strike by Lt. Cpl. \"Reneta\" and Cpl. T. \"Tomasz\" on Rzeczyca failed and Sgt. Korczak\" continued to stand idle in the Zulica forest instead of striking Ulhówek from the west.\nThe \"Waręż\" unit, under the command of Józef Kozak, captured the Dębina manor, but unsuccessfully tried to launch an attack from the direction of the meadows on Rzeczyca in order to help the \"Reneta\" grouping entangled in the battle. Lieutenant \"Czaplinski\"'s 4th grouping, without encountering any resistance in the villages of Lubcze, Szlatyn and Hubinek, moved towards Rzeczyca to support the embattled units. Also, Group VII, 2nd Lt. B. Wojciechowski, \"Czarny\" continued the attack on Dyniska, driving the UPA out of it, and then, in another offensive, captured Dębina.\nThe success of the Poles in the ongoing battle of Ulhówek and Rzeczyca could not escape the attention of the Germans, who deployed military aviation in the area of the battle, firing from their guns at Polish positions along the entire line of battle. The Germans bombed: field hospitals in the Bukowiec forest, Pawlowka, Kolonia Muratyn and Paszkiewicz's manor.\nDue to the German intervention and the numerical superiority of the Ukrainian forces, at 16:00 Zenon Jachymek ordered a retreat of Polish forces by the Huczwa river.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn total, during the offensive on the Polish side, 71 soldiers were killed and 100 were wounded. Ukrainian losses are unknown but are most likely to be heavy. During the offensive, Ukrainian civilians were killed in Ratyczów (26 killed, including 6 women and 9 children), Żerniki (32 killed, including 17 women and 1 child) and the Steniatyn colony (35 killed, including 14 women and 7 children). Though Polish forces retreated to their defensive positions the UPA was only able to counterattack on the 14th of June, the attack on Łaszczów by the UPA failed, and the attack was one of the final battles of the Polish–Ukrainian ethnic conflict in the region. The fighting in the region came to an end due to the Soviet intervention. Despite the failure of the offensive, it prevented the UPA from making any deep inroads into the Zamojszczyzna region.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe battle near Ulhówek and Rzeczyca was the largest battle fought between Polish and Ukrainian partisans during World War II in the Zamość region. In the 50th anniversary of the battle a monument was built for the partisans of the Home Army and Peasant Battalions who took part in the battles from the 2nd to the 5th of April and the 2nd of June. the battle of Rzeczyca was added in 2017, along with 21 other places to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kolt 15 Gap is a 1971 Yugoslav short documentary film written and directed by Jovan Jovanović and Miodrag Milošević. It follows the life, views and whreabouts of an unemployed Marxist metalworker. The film belongs to the Yugoslav Black Wave.\nThe documentary won awards at festivals in Oberhausen, Utrecht and Belgrade, was included in the Anthology of Films of the Oberhausen Festival (published on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the festival), and American film historian Erik Barnouw included it in his 1974 book Documentary – A History of the Non-Fiction Film.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe film follows the life and philosophy of Stanoje Ćebić, an unemployed Yugoslav metalworker and self-proclaimed Marxist fanatic, through narration and footage of him in various places mainly in and around Belgrade, which is dynamically spliced together with various other footage and photographs.\nThe film starts with his musings about being unable to attract women. It's followed by footage of him in front of Hotel Yugoslavia, which he states should be turned into a Marxist institute. He mostly expresses the sentiment that Yugoslavia has not yet reached the state of true socialism, reflecting on the exploitative nature of low-paying factory jobs, justifying his refusal to work in factories. \nIn the countryside, Ćebić, together with his father, recounts his early life during the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, when he joined the partisans at the age of 15 and then left the village in 1946 in hopes of learning a craft and earning a living, the latter of which he hasn't achieved, blaming it on the Yugoslav State's betrayal of socialist ideals, which he claims should be anti-capitalist. He calls himself a \"a blind executive of Marxism, and that [it] is [his] pride and glory, as a Yugoslav metal worker\".\nBeing unemployed, Ćebić hitchhikes and sleeps around train stations, mentioning that he rarely had a place to sleep even during his employment. He does what he refers to as \"Kolt 15 Gap\", an acronym of \"Gathering scraps and licking plates for 15 years actively and passively\" (Serbo-Croatian: Kupi otpatke, liže tanjire, 15 godina aktivno i pasivno). He talks about his various attempts to find jobs during his five-year unemployment, all of which failed in some way. He argues for abolishing the National Assembly and reducing Yugoslavia's republics to municipalities.\nDuring the final third of the film, Ćebić walks around outside a factory and interviews other workers about their knowledge of Marx and Engels and their satisfaction with their jobs, pay and living conditions, before he and the camera operator are forced to leave. At the end, he laments on the paradox of skeptical employers sending him to psychiatrists for his beliefs of equality under Marxism, while psychiatrists keep on sending him back, stating that he is perfectly sane and capable of work that he, nonetheless, can't find.\n\n\n== Style and themes ==\nThe style of the film has been described as anarchistic and dynamic, with fast cuts and most of the footage coming from a hand-held camera. It is at times more reminiscent of a pseudo-documentary and it is often comical in tone due to some of Ćebić's more absurd musings about life and politics.In a 2010 interview, Jovanović has stated that the documentary is about \"the state of the working class, which has reached the rock bottom of existence.\" The film takes a critical approach to socialism and its ideals in Yugoslav society.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKolt 15 Gap at IMDb \nKolt 15 Gap on YouTube",

The building was a two-story Neoclassical structure built of brick.  The façade had a central, gabled three-bay projection with entrances on each side.  Windows were two-over-two double-hung sashes.  A rear wing was added around 1950.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and was demolished in 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eton Town Council Offices is a municipal building in the High Street in Eton, a town in Berkshire, in England. The building, which serves as the meeting place of Eton Town Council, is a locally listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The old council offices ===\n\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated the development of Eton College, a local board was appointed in Eton on 6 October 1849. For its first 40 years the Eton Local Board met at various rented rooms in the town. The Baldwin's Bridge Trust, a charity with responsibility for maintaining the adjoining bridge over the stream called Barnes Pool, commissioned a new building at 138 High Street in the 1880s. It was designed in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick with stone dressings and was completed in 1890. It featured an arched doorway with a hood mould flanked by recessed casement windows with hood moulds. There was an oriel window on the first floor and a mullioned and transomed window on the second floor with a stepped gable above. The building at 138 High Street was designed to serve both as offices for the trust itself and to provide offices and a council chamber for Eton Local Board. The board held its first meeting in the new building on 1 January 1891.\nThe local board was succeeded by Eton Urban District Council in 1894. The urban district council continued to be based at 138 High Street until around 1957, when it moved to 102 High Street. The building at 138 High Street was then converted for commercial use and, as Bridge House, now serves as the premises of a cosmetic surgery practice.\n\n\n=== The new council offices ===\nThe current building was commissioned by the council as the town's fire station. It was designed in the Queen Anne style, built in brick with a painted finish at a cost of £5,200 and was completed in 1904. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto the High Street. It featured three round headed openings for access by the fire engines on the ground floor, six sash windows on the first floor and three Diocletian windows on the second floor, all surmounted by three gables. A plaque depicting the coat of arms of Eton was fixed to the main frontage. A roll of honour, to commemorate fire service personnel who had served in the First World War, was unveiled in the building in February 1921. The council continued to use horse-drawn fire engines until a motorised fire engine was acquired in 1922.\nAfter the fire service moved to St Leonards Road in Windsor, the building became the headquarters of the urban district council in around 1957. It continued to serve as the local seat of government until the enlarged Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council was formed in 1974. It subsequently became the offices and meeting place of Eton Town Council.\n\n\n== References ==",

Mafra.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== FC Midtjylland ===\nIn the summer of 2019, Texel joined FC Midtjylland's academy as an U17 player. Before the move, Texel played for FC Nordsjælland. Already as a 16-year-old, Texel got his first match for Midtjylland's U-19 team, and he was promoted to the squad halfway through 2021, despite being a U-17 player. In 2021–22, Texel became an important part of the U-19 team and was also captain.\nHis good performances at U-19 level were rewarded in June 2022 with a professional contract until June 2027, which Texel signed. From there, things went quickly: on October 13, 2022, he was on the bench for the first team in the UEFA Europa League match against Feyenoord, and on October 19, 2022, he made his official debut in the Danish Cup against FA 2000.\nAfter that, he was called up for the first team squad a few times, but he had to wait until June 3, 2023, before he got his chance again: here, he made his Danish Superliga debut against Odense Boldklub, replacing Mads Døhr Thychosen for the last 23 minutes.\n\n\n=== CD Mafra ===\nOn July 18, 2023, Texel, along with two other teammates, moved to Liga Portugal 2 club C.D. Mafra. Texel made his debut for the club in a league match on August 19, 2023, against F.C. Paços de Ferreira.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPontus Texel at Soccerway\nPontus Texel national team profile at the Danish Football Association (in Danish)",

        "content": "All Saints’ Church, Risley is a Grade II* listed parish church in the Church of England in Risley, Derbyshire.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is likely that the church sits on the site of the chapel of St Osyth or Scytha, which is mentioned in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1552 which records 1 bell in the steeple, 1 hand bell, 1 old vestment and 1 surples.\nThe current church dates from 1593 and was built as a domestic chapel to Risley Hall by Michael Willoughby. The south doorway contains the Willoughby arms, the date of 1593 and the initials W M K.\nOriginally served by the nearby parish of Wilne, the church was endowed by Elizabeth Gray in 1719 and an additional amount from Queen Anne's Bounty established the incumbent as a Perpetual Curate of Risley and Breaston.\nThe church was enlarged with the addition of the north aisle and vestry and the rest was repaired by subscription and a small grant from the Derby Diocesan Church Building Society at a cost of £545 in 1841 (equivalent to £52,700 in 2021). The work was carried out to the designs of the architect Henry Isaac Stevens. \nThe church was restored in 1897 and a new vestry and heating chamber was added. The chancel was refitted and the old seats were replaced by oak benches. A carved oak altar replaced the old deal one. An organ chamber was added and a new organ obtained. The roof internally was panelled with varnished pine, and the chancel walls and roof was decorated. The external walls and roof were repaired and the drainage was improved. A flagstaff was added to the tower. The work costing £2,000 (equivalent to £241,400 in 2021) was defrayed by Ernest T. Hooley.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe church contains an 2 manual and pedal 13-stop pipe organ by Brindley & Foster of 1897. It was restored by Henry Groves.& Son in 2005. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe church has 8 bells equipped with an Ellacombe apparatus for chiming. The oldest bells are of 1627 and 1628 by George Oldfield. The remainder are either 1960 or 1964 by John Taylor and Co of Loughborough.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in Derbyshire\nListed buildings in Risley, Derbyshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Franco D'Attoma (February 24, 1923 – May 7, 1991) was an Italian entrepreneur and sportsman. He was the president of the \"Perugia of miracles\" team that remained unbeaten in the 1978-79 Serie A season.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFranco D'Attoma, born in Puglia into a wealthy family exporting agricultural products to the United States, attended a high school in Puglia before pursuing a degree in agriculture at the University of Perugia.\nIn 1960 he  joined the renowned clothing industry Ellesse as a partner, having become the brother-in-law of Leonardo Servadio. Servadio freely transferred some shares to him. D'Attoma was tasked with handling administration and personnel relations.\nHe later ascended to management within Ellesse, before transitioning to sports management for AC Perugia. Collaborating with Spartaco Ghini, an industrialist, they laid the foundation for promotion to Serie A.  Perugia's peak under his management was reached in the 1978–79 season, where they finished Runners Up behind Serie A champions AC Milan without losing a single game.\nD'Attoma introduced the Perugia kit for the 1979-1980 season, marking the debut of jersey sponsorship in Italian football. Together with the introduction of shirt sponsorships, initially banned by the FIGC, he also pioneered the acquisition of players on loan. Finding a loophole in sponsorship regulations, D'Attoma founded a textile company under the guise of a pasta factory, effectively becoming the true sponsor, revolutionizing football economics.\nHis acquisition of Paolo Rossi showcased D'Attoma's extraordinary abilities. Despite competition from major clubs like Juventus, Milan, and Inter, Perugia secured Rossi on loan for a record fee of 500 million lire.\n\n\n== References ==",

After studying Talmud under his father, he attended for some time the lectures by Rabbi Moses Sofer of Presburg.\nIn 1840 he married Golde, the daughter of merchant David Stössl of Liptó-Szent-Miklós, and settled in that town. There he dedicated himself to Talmudic study, earning a reputation for scholarship that attracted many devoted pupils. In 1868 he assumed the position of rabbi of the Orthodox congregation of Liptó-Szent-Miklós.\nBaneth died in 1871, leaving behind a manuscript volume containing notes on the Talmud.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore; Baneth, Eduard (1902). \"Baneth, Jerahmeel Dob (Bernhard)\".

In 2023 the two-year-old colt won the Grade I American Pharoah Stakes at Santa Anita Park. In 2024 he won the Grade I Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. \n\n\n== Background ==\nMuth is a bay colt who was bred by the Don Alberto Corporation, out of the winning Uncle Mo mare Hoppa. Muth is the mare's first foal.  Muth was first sold in 2022 at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale as part of the Hill 'n' Dale Sales Agency consignment for US$190,000 to the Bishop Bloodstock. The following year Muth was auctioned at the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company's 2023 March Sale of Two-Year-Olds in Training for US$2 million to Amr Zedan and his Zedan Racing Stables.\nMuth was named after Aaron Muth, a long time friend and enthusiastic supporter of trainer Bob Baffert and his stable. When it came to naming the horse after owner Amr Zedan purchased him, Baffert asked if the horse could be named after his longtime support and Zedan agreed.\nAlthough Muth has enough points to compete in the 2024 Kentucky Derby, he is ineligible after Churchill Downs extended a ban on Baffert entering horses at its tracks following the positive drug test and subsequent disqualification of 2021 Derby winner Medina Spirit. A legal bid by Zedan to lift Churchill's ban on Baffert was dismissed by the Jefferson County Circuit Court on April 18, 2024. A spokesman for Zedan said that an emergency appeal would be filed.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sidmouth Lifeboat is a charity that provides lifeboat and lifeguard services in Sidmouth in Devon, England. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) previously operated a lifeboat at Sidmouth between 1869 and 1912. The charity's independent service dates from 1968 and since 2019 its principal lifeboat has been an Arctic 24 boat named Peter & Barbara Truesdale.\n\n\n== RNLI Sidmouth Lifeboat Station ==\nThe RNLI had established stations at Lyme Regis in 1853 and at Exmouth in 1858. The station at Sidmouth was opened in 1869 to cover the coast between the two earlier stations. A boathouse was built at the end of Ham Lane which housed two lifeboats at different times:\n\nThe Sidmouth RNLI lifeboat saved 38 lives but by 1912 it was seldom called out and so the station was closed. The boathouse was later demolished but a stone carved with the initials 'RNLBI' was saved and is now over a doorway of the building that stands on the site.\n\n\n== Independent service ==\nStudents at a local secondary school set up a beach lifesaving organisation in 1968 and a rigid inflatable lifeboat was purchased in 1972. The organisation was accredited with the Coastguard as a rescue facility in 1982. A new boathouse was built on The Esplanade when it obtained a new lifeboat in 1991. The lifeboat covers Lyme Bay between Budleigh Salterton and Axmouth.\n\n\n== Inshore lifeboats ==\n\nThe Arctic 24 lifeboats are 7.66 m (25.1 ft) long and can carry 4 crew with 8 survivors. Sidmouth Lifeboat also operates a 4.2 m (14 ft) MilproAvon Sea Rider boat which is known as Speedy Sid.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndependent lifeboats in Britain and Ireland\nList of former RNLI stations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSidmouth Lifeboat",

It was built in 1863 as one of eight forts for the defense of Columbus, Georgia, which was a major producer of war materiel for the Confederacy.  The pentagonal fort is 30 yards (27 m) per side, with earthen walls.  During the Battle of Columbus on April 16, 1865, the Confederate army was badly undermanned, and Fort No. 5 was left unoccupied as the Union Army captured Columbus.\nThe fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marguerite du Tertre de Lamarche (1638–1706) was a French midwife.\nMarguerite Dutertre was born in 1638 to a poor family in Paris, and was orphaned at an early age. She was brought up by a woman named LaTouche, who acted as a mother to her. She was intending to become a nun until meeting a nurse from the Hôtel-Dieu, Paris who inspired her to take up midwifery. She attended classes at the Hôtel-Dieu, studying midwifery, anatomy and medicine. She married  Jean Didiot, sieur de Lamarche when she was aged 23, and a year later became the head midwife of the Hôtel-Dieu, teaching students. At the request of the administrators of the Hôtel-Dieu, she produced her book on the principles of midwifery, D'instructions familières et très-faciles, faites par questions et réponses touchant toutes les choses principales qu une sagefemme doit savoir pour Vexercice de son art. (Familiar and very easy instructions, made up of questions and answers, touching on all the main things that a midwife must know to practice her art.) in the form of a series of questions and answers. It was published in 1677 and dedicated to the jurist Guillaume de Lamoignon, marquis de Basville.\nHer book D'instructions familières ... has been said to be \"the first medical textbook written by a woman in Europe\" (\"den första medicinska läroboken skriven av en kvinna i Europa\"), but Louise Bourgeois, known as La Boursier, has also been described as \"the first female author in [France] to publish a medical text\", as her Observations diverses sur la stérilité, perte de fruict, foecondité, accouchements et maladies des femmes et enfants nouveaux naiz (Various observations on sterility, loss of fruit, fecundity, childbirth and illnesses of  women and newly born children) was published in three volumes from 1609 onwards.\nLamarche's book was divided into three sections:\n\n\"les choses que la sage-femme doit savoir, qui précèdent l'accouchement\" (\"things the midwife needs to know before childbirth\")\n\"les choses qui arrivent dans le temps de l'accouchement, dont la sage-femme doit avoir connaissance\" (\"things that happen during childbirth, of which the midwife must be aware\")\n\"les choses qui suivent l'accouchement, dont la connaissance est nécessaire à la sagefemme\" (\"things that follow childbirth, knowledge of which is necessary for the midwife\").\nIt was originally published in 1677, and a second edition, with additional material by Louise Boursier, was published in 1710.\nLamarche died in Paris in 1706.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nD'instructions familières et très-faciles, faites par questions et réponses touchant toutes les choses principales qu une sagefemme doit savoir pour l'exercice de son art.

        "content": "The Polish Union (Polish: Zjednoczenie Polskie, ZP), also known as the Regional Agreement RdR (Polish: Porozumienie Regionalne RdR, PR-RdR) in 1993, was a Christian-democratic centre-right political party in Poland. The party was founded by defectors from Polish Christian-democratic party Movement for the Republic, who left the party over the dispute regarding forming a possible coalition with Centre Agreement, the party that Movement for the Republic was itself a split from. Shortly after being formed, the Polish Union announced an electoral union with the Centre Agreement in June 1993, known as Centre Agreement – Polish Union.\nIn the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, Centre Agreement - Polish Union won 609,973 votes which amounted to 4.42%, falling short of reaching the 5% electoral threshold needed in order to gain seats in the Sejm. However, the party did win a single seat in the Senate. After the defeat in the 1993 election, the party left Centre Agreement - Polish Union and re-registered itself as a separate party. The Polish Union then became one of the founding members of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), and 7 of the party members gained seats in the 1997 Polish parliamentary election as part of the AWS. The party then dissolved in 1997 to join the Social Movement.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party has its origins in Centre Agreement, a moderate Christian-democratic party founded in May 1990, which participated in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election as part of the Centre Civic Alliance, a coalition supported by President Lech Wałęsa. After the election, new Sejm disbanded the short-lived cabinet of Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and formed the Cabinet of Jan Olszewski, led by Centre Agreement.\nThe cabinet of Olszewski as known as the \"Agreement of Five\", as it consisted of five centre to centre-right parties - Liberal Democratic Congress, Confederation of Independent Poland, Christian National Union, Peasants' Agreement and the Centre Agreement. However, internal infighting between the government members proved paralysing to Olszewski, and in 1992 President Wałęsa officially withdrew his support for Olszewski and his cabinet, prompting its downfall. Waldemar Pawlak became the new Prime Minister of Poland, coming from post-communist Polish People's Party.\nBlaming the president as well as leader of Centre Agreement, Jarosław Kaczyński, for the downfall of his cabinet, Olszewski and party members loyal to him left the party to form Movement for the Republic (RdR) in 1992. As the party started preparing itself for the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, a faction of the party led by Andrzej Anusz proposed an electoral agreement with the Centre Agreement, considering it a pragmatic option that is necessary in order for the RdR to cross the electoral threshold and keep its seats in the Sejm.\nHowever, Olszewski strongly opposed this proposal, and the subsequent conflict led Anusz and his faction to leave Movement for the Republic. Those who left founded Regional Agreement RdR, led by Anusz and Barczyk. Anusz and his new party then carried out their plan for an electoral agreement with Kaczyński, forming Centre Agreement – Polish Union. However, the party failed to cross the 5% electoral threshold as it earned 4.42% of the popular vote in the 1993 elections.\nThe agreement with Centre Agreement was then dissolved, and Polish Union was registered as a separate party under the leadership of Kazimierz Barczyk. The Polish Union continued its strategy of trying to cooperate with fellow centre-right parties, and in the 1995 Polish presidential election the party endorsed Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz for president.\nIn 1996, the party became on the founding members of the Solidarity Electoral Action. In the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, the party ran as a part of the Solidarity Electoral Action, with 7 of the party members gaining mandates in the Sejm. These were:\n\nAndrzej Anusz;\nKazimierz Barczyk;\nJoanna Fabisiak;\nMarek Markiewicz;\nBernard Szweda;\nTomasz Wełnicki;\nPiotr Wójcik.\nThe party dissolved in 1998 to join the Social Movement.\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Polish Union was a Christian-democratic and a centre-right party. It identified with Political Catholicism and argued that the Polish state should take a protective role towards the Catholic Church, protecting it from anti-clerical policies as well as unfair ideological attacks. It particularly condemned the \"leftist-post-communist milieu\" for its harsh anti-clerical rhetoric, although it made a reference to the existence of few left-wing groupings that were friendly towards the Church. Prominent member of the party, Andrzej Anusz, described the party as \"Solidarity-based, pro-independence, Christian democratic, and popular-national\".\nIn administrative matters, the party stated its strong preference for a parliamentary republic over a presidential republic, stating that the Prime Minister should have the power to manage all government ministries, with no presidential interference. The Polish Union also argued that economic crimes, especially those committed by public officials, should be considered the most serious crimes in the Polish criminal code. The party stated: \"People who have committed crimes must be punished, their privileges must be stripped and all those who have acted to the detriment of the nation must be removed from state service. Without this, it is impossible to run a healthy state order and a healthy economy.\" The party also postulated increasing the competences of local governments, believing that local governments should have the power to pursue economic policies best suited for local conditions.\nIn its economic program, the Polish Union stated its support for social market economy that would be \"based on the social teaching of the Church. According to the party, such combination would result in \"economic efficiency while ensuring moral values\". The party also argued that Polish economy should be based on small businesses, which should be given special state support in forms of lenient credits and subsidies. In contrast, large and foreign corporations were to be strictly regulated and appropriately taxed. It also wanted to maintain healthcare and education completely in the control of the state. The Polish Union also proposed anti-trust regulations that would root out 'unfair competition', and tariffs on agrarian products in order to protect Polish agriculture.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3396 is a peculiar barred irregular galaxy in the constellation Leo Minor. The galaxy lies about 80 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3396 is approximately 85,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 7, 1785.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNGC 3396 forms an interacting pair with NGC 3395, a spiral galaxy that lies 1.5 arcminutes from NGC 3396. The mass ratio of the two galaxies is about 1.5 to 1, with NGC 3395 being the more massive of the two. The two galaxies appear separate but a bridge of material is visible between them and tidal tails are observed. Dynamical modelling of the pair suggests that the two galaxies had a first close encounter in the past, which resulting in gas been stripped from NGC 3395 and forming a tidal tail to the south-east. A second close encounter took place about 50 million years ago, resulting to starburst activity. The two galaxies will most likely merge in the next 500 million years.\nThe galaxy hosts a number of HII regions that are star forming with the region of most intense star formation being in the center of the galaxy. The average size of the knots in NGC 3396 is an order of magnitude larger than those in NGC 3395. The central region of NGC 3396 is estimated to host 1,000 to 2,000 Wolf-Rayet stars and tens of thousands of O-type stars. The star formation rate in the circumnuclear is estimated to be 0.15 M☉ per year and in the rest of the galaxy 0.39 M☉.\nThe nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active and based on its spectrum it has been categorised as a LINER. Kinematic analysis of the gas indicates there is gas inflow to the centre of the galaxy along its bar and also there is an biconal outflow element that could be galactic wind from a supermassive black hole in the nucleus.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nThe NGC 3395/3396 pair is part of the NGC 3430 Group or LGG 218. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 3381, NGC 3424, NGC 3430, NGC 3442, and IC 2604. IC 2604 lies 14 arcmin to the south-west of the pair and IC 2608 14 arcmin to the south-east. The group is part of the Leo II groups, which is part of the Virgo Supercluster.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3396 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "The Pashtunistan conflict also known as the Durand Line issue, was a series of conflicts that broke out between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan over border issues in the early days of the Cold War. As part of the Afghanistan–Pakistan border skirmishes, the conflict affects insurgencies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\nHostilities existed between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan since 1947, when Afghanistan became the only country to vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations. Before Pakistan's independence, Afghanistan advocated the independence of its north-west frontier, although the region's predominant Pashtun population had voted overwhelmingly in favor of Pakistan over India in the referendum held in July 1947. 99.02% votes were cast in favor of Pakistan. Though the proposed Pashtunistan state by Afghanistan fluctuated in size over time, the Balochistan province of Pakistan was also frequently included in the Greater Pastunistan definition to gain access to the Arabian sea in case Pakistan failed as a state, as Afghanistan had expected, but the idea became unpopular. Border clashes first occurred in 1949 and continued till decisive Afghan defeat in Bajaur Campaign although Afghanistan continued to back insurgents.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe International border between British India and Afghanistan was established after the 1893 Durand Line Agreement between British Mortimer Durand of British India and Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence. The single-page agreement, which contains seven short articles, was signed by Durand and Khan, agreeing not to exercise political interference beyond the frontier line between what was then the Emirate of Afghanistan and what was also then the British Indian Empire. The Durand Line was reaffirmed as the International Border between Afghanistan and British India in the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War after the Afghan independence. The Afghans undertook to stop interference on the British side of the line in the subsequent Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 in Rawalpindi.\nPakistan inherited the Durand Line agreement after its independence in 1947, but the Afghan Government has always refused to accept the Durand Line Agreement. Afghanistan has several times tried to seize Pakistan's western provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The then Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, said \"if an independent Pashtunistan cannot be set up, the frontier province should join Afghanistan. Our neighbor Pakistan will realize that our country, with its population and trade, needs an outlet to the sea, which is very essential\", in an interview with the Statesman. In 1949, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir propagating independent Pashtunistan. Border clashes were reported in 1949–50 for the first time.\n\n\n== Waziristan rebellion ==\n\nBetween 1948 and 1954, Waziristan was subject to a rebellion led by Faqir of Ipi and his followers who occupied the area of Datta Khel and declared the independent state of Pashtunistan. In 1949, Pakistan Air Force warplane accidentally bombed an Afghan village killing 23 people which lead to nullification of Durand line by Afghanistan. The rebellion was suppressed by 1953–1954 PAF bombing campaign which led to the surrender of most of the forces effectively ending the rebellion.\n\n\n== 1950 Chaman campaign ==\n\n\n=== Invasion ===\nOn 30 September 1950, Afghan forces and allied pro-Pashtunistan tribesmen crossed Durand lineand occupied Bogra pass, a strategic pass about 30 km north of Chaman with the aim of capturing the Quetta-Chaman railway link. The invading force containing Afghan troops was also supported by Afghan artillery. Although Afghanistan government officially denied it's involvement and asserted that the invaders were pro-Pashtunistan tribesmen.\n\n\n=== Counteroffensive ===\nUpon the reception of reports about Afghan invasion, Pakistan Army was rushed to the area of Bogra pass about 30km northwest of Chaman to repel the invasion.Pakistan Air Force also bombed enemy positions and it had a key impact. Invading force soon retreated to the mountainous area of Dobandi, which was a strategic stronghold it became very difficult to dislodge enemy positions but Pakistan Air Force led a bombing campaign against the invading force. At last after 6 days of fighting Pakistani forces retook the control of area and Afghan invading force was pushed back into Afghan territory.\n\n\n== 1950–51 Khyber campaign ==\nIn 1950 Afghan Air Force planes airdropped pro-Pashtunistan into the Khyber agency of Pakistan. Similarly, during 1950–51 Three Lashkars led by Afghan military and supported by Afghan artillery attacked Pakistani positions across the Durand Line in Khyber Agency. The invading force was declared as ‘Freedom Fighters’ by the official Radio and Press of Afghanistan. Pakistan responded by blockading Afghanistan's trade transit routes.\n\n\n== Bajaur campaign ==\n\nThe Bajaur Campaign was an armed conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan that began in September 1960 and ended in September 1961. It primarily took place in and around Bajaur District in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Hostilities broke out after Afghan prime minister Mohammad Daoud Khan, who was a vocal opponent of the Durand Line, sent in the Royal Afghan Army to occupy strategic regions in what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which is considered to be an essential part of the Pashtun homeland. Ultimately, the Afghan invasion was brought to a halt following Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan's Kunar Province. The Bajaur Campaign may have been a proxy conflict of the Cold War, as it has been alleged that the Afghans and the Pakistanis were actively receiving support from the Soviet Union and the United States, respectively.\n\n\n== 1970s operation in Balochistan ==\nThe Fourth Balochistan Conflict was a five-year military conflict in Balochistan, the largest province of Pakistan, between the Pakistan Army and Baloch separatists and tribesmen that lasted from 1973 to 1977.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nKaur, Kulwant (1985).

        "content": "Mikel Johan Gogorza Krüger-Johnsen (born 27 September 2006) is a Danish footballer who plays as a left winger for the U-19 squad of Danish Superliga club FC Midtjylland.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nGogorza started playing football when he was four years old at B 1903. After a few years, he switched to local club BSV. Here, the offensive player played until the age of eight before moving on to Lyngby BK's youth department.\nHe spent five years at Lyngby, after which he returned to the Copenhagen football environment to play at U13, U14 and finally U15 for F.C. Copenhagen. Halfway through his time as an U15 player, Gogorza felt it was time to try something new. He then joined FC Midtjylland at the age of 14. After a good start to his new adventure, where Gogorza had scored four goals for his new club in the U15 league, Gogorza signed his first contract with Midtjylland, putting his signature on a 3-year youth contract in October 2021.\n\n\n=== FC Midtjylland ===\nOn September 27, 2023, Gogorza was included in the first team squad for the first time when he was selected for a cup match against Næstved Boldklub, but without playing. In November and December 2023, he was also on the bench for two Danish Superligas, again without making his debut.\nIn January 2024, 17-year-old Gogorza traveled with the first team to Portugal for a training camp and from there, it wasn't long before he made his official debut; On February 18, 2024, Gorgoza came on for the final 11 minutes of the Danish Superliga match against Brøndby IF. At 17 years and 144 days, he became the third youngest Midtjylland player ever to make his debut.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGogorza is of Danish-Basque descent with a mother from Denmark and a father from the Basque Country. Therefore, he has both a Danish and a French passport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMikel Gogorza at Soccerway\nMikel Gogorza national team profile at the Danish Football Association (in Danish)",

The seating capacity of the arena for basketball games is 3,118 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nPalasport Flaminio was built in two different sections: the first part, including only the swimming pool and a gym, was completed in 1972, while a second part, that includes the main sports hall, was officially opened on September 25, 1977. It immediately became the new home sports hall of Basket Rimini. The team, which was playing in Serie B at the time, achieved promotion to Serie A2 for the first time in its history at the end of that season.\nAmong the various disciplines, the arena was used also for handball: two different teams from the town of Rimini (Pallamano Rimini and Handball Club Rimini) were both competing in Serie A in those years.\nAt the end of the 1983–84 season, Basket Rimini obtained promotion to Serie A1, the highest-tier level of the Italian basketball league system. In the following years, the team continued to play mainly between Serie A1 and Serie A2. Multiple basketball champions played at Flaminio as opponents, such as Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame members Bob McAdoo, Oscar Schmidt, George Gervin, Dino Radja and Dominique Wilkins, as well as some NBA All-Stars including Mike Mitchell, Micheal Ray Richardson and Manu Ginóbili, and other great players like Darryl Dawkins and Toni Kukoč. Between 1998 and 2000, Basket Rimini qualified also for the FIBA Korać Cup, the third-tier level club competition in European basketball.\nThe arena also hosted concerts, especially during its first decades. James Brown and Ray Charles performed here.\nThe local basketball team (in the meantime renamed Basket Rimini Crabs) left the Palasport Flaminio in February 2003, moving to the new and more capacious 105 Stadium. They played in Legadue (the new name of Serie A2) at the new arena until 2011, then the club had economic problems and started again from the fourth highest league. Playing in the minor leagues, the team returned to play at the Palasport Flaminio.\nA new club was created in 2018 under the name Rinascita Basket Rimini, which subsequently acquired the historic title of the Crabs. Through this new project, the team achieved two promotions in four years, therefore the Palasport Flaminio returned to hosting Serie A2 matches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of indoor arenas in Italy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 18 October 1976, two armed robbers, Tay Cher Kiang (郑芝强 Zhèng Zhīqiáng) and Chang Bock Eng (庄木荣 Zhuāng Mùróng), held several people hostage at a paint shop in Balestier Road, Singapore in an attempt to commit armed robbery, and during the holdup, Chang, who wielded a revolver, engaged in a gunfight with the police, injuring a police constable named Neo Koon San (梁坤山 Liáng Kūnshān) during the confrontation. Both Chang and Tay were subsequently arrested and charged under the Arms Offences Act for the unauthorized use of firearms. Both Chang and Tay were found guilty and sentenced to death in August 1977, and they were hanged on 9 May 1980 after exhausting all avenues of appeal, which all ended with failure.\n\n\n== Armed holdup and gunfight ==\nOn the evening of 18 October 1976, at a paint shop in Singapore's Balestier Road, an armed hold-up by two gunmen took place at the shop itself, followed by a gunfight that broke out between the gunmen and the police.\nOn the day in question, at the paint shop, two armed robbers, one wielding a dagger and the other wielding a .38 Colt revolver, barged into the shop and held a total of three people hostage; the hostage trio consisted of the shop's 55-year-old owner Chan Chin Tong (曾振栋 Zēng Zhèndòng), his 57-year-old sister-in-law Kang Geok Hun (康玉云 Kāng Yùyún) and Kang's 41-year-old nephew Chan Tai Peow (曾太宝 Zēng Tàibǎo). One of the robbers held the hostages on gunpoint and demanded them to hand over their valuables. While the hostages handed over their money to the robbers, a female passer-by witnessed the hold-up and called the police.\nTwo patrol cars later arrived at the scene upon the making of the police report. The first police officer to arrive at the scene was 23-year-old Police Constable (PC) Neo Koon San, who drove the first patrol car to the scene. As soon as PC Neo alighted the car, he was shot in the right upper arm and thumb by the gunman, and therefore collapsed on the ground, and the fallen officer's colleague, 34-year-old police sergeant Tan Kah Kiau (陈家健 Chén Jiājiàn), who drove the other patrol car, went inside the shop to confront the gunman. A brief shoot-out therefore took place in the shop between Sergeant Tan and the gunman, who was holding Chan Chin Tong on gunpoint during the shoot-out. Eventually, Sergeant Tan managed to wound the gunman in the stomach and subdued him with the help of several other arriving policemen.\nThe injured gunman was therefore arrested and taken to Singapore General Hospital for treatment while under police custody, and the second perpetrator, who was also hurt during the gunfight, had fled and police were still tracing his whereabouts, and sent a team of officers to conduct a manhunt for the accomplice in the nearby area; his dagger was abandoned at the scene of crime. As for PC Neo and Chan Chin Tong, the latter who was injured on the shoulder by a stray bullet, they were both rushed to Toa Payoh Hospital for immediate treatment, and both of them survived their injuries. Likewise, the gunman, who was in critical condition when he was first admitted in the hospital, survived after undergoing a surgery, and he was subsequently transferred to Changi Prison Hospital to continue recovering from his gunshot wounds.\nIn the aftermath of the shoot-out, the police commissioner Tan Teck Khim commended the two police officers present at the scene for their courage and utmost efforts to fulfill their line of duty during the shooting incident, and the member of the public for reporting the matter to the police on time. PC Neo and Chan both later recovered from their injuries.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nWhile he was still hospitalized, the injured gunman, identified as 30-year-old Chang Bock Eng, was charged with firing a revolver at Police Constable Neo Koon San three days prior Meanwhile, the police continued to search for Chang's accomplice and they also established his identity. The accomplice, who was a member of a notorious gang of robbers, was arrested less than a week after during a police round-up, which also oversaw the capture of another eight gang members. The accomplice, identified as 29-year-old Tay Cher Kiang, was charged for being an accomplice of Chang with the knowledge that Chang possessed and would use a firearm to commit a crime.\nAs the death sentence was mandated under the Arms Offences Act for the unlicensed use of firearms in Singapore, both Chang and Tay would be handed the death penalty if found guilty. The two men were remanded to assist in investigations while pending trial for their roles in the shoot-out. Prior to this, the Arms Offences Act was first enacted in 1973 in an attempt by the government of Singapore to reduce the rates of gun-related crime and violence in Singapore.\nIn November 1976, both Tay and Chang were brought back to court to face additional charges for unrelated crimes they committed prior to the armed hold-up at Balestier Road. Tay and Chang were both accused of robbing a 40-year-old Ng Lee Sing of S$16,300 at MacPherson Road on 20 October 1975, and the both of them were also charged with robbing a 39-year-old Chew Chin Lee of S$3,000 at Ramlai Road on 26 May 1976. On both occasions, Chang was also armed with a revolver while Tay wielded a knife on the second robbery.\nApart from the crimes he and Tay committed together, Chang was also solely responsible for three more criminal cases that occurred before the shoot-out. Chang had stolen a motorcycle worth S$1,500 from a man named Leong Kaw at Geylang in August 1975, and he also committed two robberies in August 1975 and July 1976 respectively, and he made off with a watch worth S$350 and about $5,200 in cash from both these robberies. In total, Chang faced five fresh charges while Tay had another two criminal charges pending against him for the unrelated cases he and Chang got involved in. All the while since October 1976, the pair were remanded in prison while awaiting trial for the shooting incident at Balestier Road.\n\n\n== Trial ==\n\nIn August 1977, Tay Cher Kiang and Chang Bock Eng stood trial at the High Court for their roles in the armed holdup and gunfight. Chang faced one count of unlawful discharge of a firearm with intent to cause harm under Section 4 of the Arms Offences Act, while Tay faced one count of being an accomplice of a person at the scene of a firearm offence under Section 5 of the Arms Offences Act. Although both charges were of a different nature, they both carried the death penalty. The trial, which was presided by both Justice Dennis Cosmos D'Cotta (D C D'Cotta) and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua (F A Chua), was delayed at one point due to one of the defendants, Chang, falling ill during the proceedings and was therefore unfit to stand trial. Throughout the trial, Tay was represented by defence lawyer Lim Chye Huat while Chang was represented by both A Ramanujan and R Doraisamy.\nThe prosecution, led by Lawrence Ang and Theresa Teh, presented to the court that both men had entered the paint shop with intention to commit armed robbery, and the turn of events that ultimately led to the gunfight. The court was told that after Chang and Tay intruded the shop and held the shop owner Chan Chin Tong and his two other relatives hostage, Chang forced Chan's nephew to go open up the shop's safe, while Tay was told to guard both Chan and his sister-in-law Kang Geok Hun. Kang appeared as a witness and said that she heard Chang threatening to shoot Chan, and she was also forced to hand over her two diamond rings to the two armed men, who also managed to reap S$1,000 from the hostages. Police Constable Neo Koon San, who was promoted to Corporal by August 1977, appeared in court to testify that Chang had threatened to shoot Chan, when the gunman was confronted by the police officers that arrived at the shop, and he also testified how he was being shot at by Chang while he tried to intervene in the situation. PC Ho Yu Chon, another police officer present at the scene, testified that he heard the gunshot coming from inside the shop and Corporal Neo was therefore injured, before Sergeant Tan Kah Kiau (who also became a witness) gunned down Chang and arrested him, after Chang did not heed Sergeant Tan's request to surrender. A 18-year-old clerk Ng Gek Lang, who was the final witness out of 27 prosecution witnesses, testified that she heard a couple of gunshots outside her house, and she also witnessed one man running into the house of her neighbour Chua Hang Piow, and later, she saw police entering Chua's house and came out with a shirt, which the prosecution argued was worn by Tay before he removed it and changed into another shirt prior to his escape.\nBased on the statements given by Chang to Inspector R Balasubramaniam, who recorded the statements with the help of a female interpreter Chi Pin Hoon during Chang's hospitalization, Chang denied that he opened fire inside the paint shop. Chang told the inspector that he never meant to shoot the gun and harm anyone, and he claimed that when he held Chan at gunpoint, he was shot on the arm and dropped his gun, and somehow heard another gunshot, and he never knew how Corporal Neo was shot in spite of him not firing the gun throughout the confrontation. As for Tay, he denied that he gave his statements voluntarily, and Tay, who was a self-confessed heroin addict, claimed that during police interrogation, he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and was full of discomfort, and he was not fit to give his account to the police, and sought to have his statements ruled inadmissible as evidence.\nAt the close of the prosecution's case, the trial court ruled that there was a case for both Chang and Tay to answer, and they both elected to put up their defence after the court told them to enter their defence. Chang, who was the first to testify on the stand, told the court that it was not an intentional shooting. He testified that he never intended to use the gun to harm anyone, and he only used it to threaten the hostages on gunpoint and demand the money from them. Chang said that when he was confronted by the policemen, he never fired the gun and only aimed it at Chan Chin Tong's head, verbally threatening to shoot Chan if any of the policemen came nearer to him. Chang testified that he heard a shot ringing out during a brief struggle between him and the policemen and Chan cried out in pain, while he himself felt his right hand turned numb and he dropped the gun before the police closed in to him and subdued him. As for Tay, he stated that he was unaware of the revolver in Chang's possession, and he only realized that Chang was armed with the revolver but he stayed on out of fear of Chang, and Tay also said his role was only limited to being a look-out and guarding the hostages while Chang did most of the dirty work.\nOn 26 August 1977, after a trial lasting 11 days, the two trial judges - Justice F A Chua and Justice D C D'Cotta - delivered their verdict. Justice Chua, who pronounced the decision in court, stated that the two judges found that Chang had indeed deliberately fired the revolver at Corporal Neo, and he did so with the intention and motive to cause physical harm to the policeman, and it was therefore not an accidental shooting as what Chang insisted in his defence. Turning to Tay's role in the shoot-out, Justice Chua cited that Tay had the knowledge that Chang was armed with a revolver and he knew that it would be potentially used during the course of armed robbery, and he never took steps to prevent Chang from using the firearm, and he was effectively considered to be in voluntary association with Chang and consorting with a man armed with a firearm. Based on these findings, the two trial judges concluded that there are sufficient grounds to convict both accused of all the respective charges preferred against them.\nTherefore, 31-year-old Chang Bock Eng was found guilty of unlawfully discharging his firearm with intent to cause harm under Section 4 of the Arms Offences Act, while 29-year-old Tay Cher Kiang was found guilty under Section 5 of the Arms Offences Act for being an accomplice of Chang during the course of the offence Chang committed. For their respective convictions, both Chang and Tay were sentenced to death by hanging.\n\n\n== Appeal processes ==\nOn 21 February 1979, both Chang Bock Eng and Tay Cher Kiang, who were represented by P Suppiah and J B Jeyaretnam respectively, submitted appeals to the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, to review their convictions and sentences. However, the Court of Appeal's three-judge panel - consisting of Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin and two Supreme Court judges Choor Singh and T S Sinnathuray - dismissed the appeals and upheld the trial ruling.\nAfter the dismissal of their appeals, both Chang and Tay filed legal motions for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council in London against their convictions and sentences, but the Privy Council dismissed the motion on 2 November 1979, and therefore confirming the death penalty for the condemned pair.\nAs a final recourse to be spared the gallows, both Tay and Chang made a final death row plea for clemency to the President of Singapore with hopes to commute their death sentences to life in prison. However, then President Benjamin Sheares rejected their petitions and finalized their death sentences.\n\n\n== Execution of the robbers ==\nOn 9 May 1980, after eating their last breakfast, 34-year-old Chang Bock Eng and 31-year-old Tay Cher Kiang were both hanged in Changi Prison at dawn. Tay and Chang were the eighth and ninth persons to be put to death under the Arms Offences Act since 1973, and before the pair, there were seven people (including \"Bakar Negro\" Sha Bakar Dawood) executed in four previous cases prosecuted under the Act.\nA Singaporean Chinese newspaper Sin Chew Jit Poh published an exclusive article about the case two days after the double executions of Tay and Chang. It was used as a case example to remind readers, especially those of young age, to not commit crimes, especially those that attract capital punishment which might lead to them losing their lives.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArms Offences Act\nCapital punishment in Singapore\nList of major crimes in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "António Manuel Sala Mira Gomes (born in 1949) is a Portuguese radio and television presenter and journalist, as well as a singer and songwriter. He has worked in various capacities throughout his life, including as a singer, music producer and composer, journalist, radio director, radio host and television presenter. After a quite noteworthy career with the Maranata musical ensemble he achieved nationwide success with Rádio Renascença's \"Despertar\", the morning radio show that was a Portuguese popularity phenomenon in the 1980s and 1990s. He was once vice-president of Sport Lisboa e Benfica.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAntónio Sala was born in 1949 in Vilar de Andorinho, Vila Nova de Gaia, in Northern Portugal. It was on the radio that António Sala stood out the most, making his debut in 1967, at Rádio Ribatejo and Emissores Associados de Lisboa, from where he later moved to Radiodifusão Portuguesa. At the end of the 1960s, he took his first steps in music taking advantage of his studies in choral singing. He came to prominence as a member of the Maranata, a music group founded in 1972. \nIn 1978, he was voted announcer of the year, in what was the first of many awards he won thanks to his work as a radio presenter and director, mainly on Rádio Renascença's \"Despertar\" program, which aired for 18 years. Between 1981 and 1994, with the Renascença's \"Despertar\", the morning radio show that was a popularity phenomenon in the 1980s and 1990s and brought together António Sala in Lisbon and Olga Cardoso from Porto between 7 and 10 am, he completely dominated the national scene in this field, winning awards from Casa da Imprensa, TV Guia magazine and Nova Gente magazine. Some live broadcasts were considered innovative at the time in the country, such as those made in Vienna (Austria), Stuttgart (Germany), Seville (Spain), Macau and Expo'98 (Lisbon), or on board of planes, boats and submarines. \nIn 1979, he composed the hit song \"Zé Brasileiro Português de Braga\", in partnership with Vasco Lima Couto, which was performed by Portuguese singer Alexandra at the RTP \"Festival da Canção\". In 1980, again at the RTP \"Festival da Canção\", António Sala won the prize for best performer, along with José Cid and Alexandra. At the same time, while working in radio and music, Sala also worked in television, starting in the 1970s with the program \"Música Maestro\", which was followed by many others, including the competitions \"Palavra Puxa Palavra\" and \"Um, Dois, Três\", the Portuguese version of Spanish TV program Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez, in 1994 and 1995, when Sala replaced Carlos Cruz. \nIn 1984, he began writing jokes, an endeavour he repeated two years later due to the success of the first publishing. In 1987, he published a book of poetry entitled Palavras Despidas de Música (Words Stripped of Music). In 1995 and 1996, António Sala started teaching Journalism and Social and Cultural Communication at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon. Also in 1996, he released a double CD entitled Trinta Anos de Carreira (Thirty Years of Career), featuring his greatest hits. In fiction, he presented the novel Império de Brandos Costumes (2000). Between 1997 and 2000, he was also vice-president of Sport Lisboa e Benfica (SL Benfica). He was responsible for the unsuccessful creation of a club television channel during João Vale e Azevedo's controversial presidency of SL Benfica.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAntónio Sala is married to Elizabeth Sala and has a son called Miguel Sala. His father's name was Arlindo Gomes and he played the accordion without knowing music and painted without any training. His mother, Carmen Sala, was a poet. As a boy, Sala dreamed of being a director or a pianist.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "San Juan de Villalobos is a corregiment in the south of the department of Cauca in the region known as Media Bota Caucana, municipality of Santa Rosa. The town was settled in 1937 along National Route 45 at a distance of 8 km from the border between the departments of Huila and Cauca. This town is an obligatory passage between Pitalito and Mocoa and has gained relevance after the construction of National Route 45.\n\n\n== History ==\nSan Juan de Villalobos is a town of settlers who came to the area mostly from the Caqueta, Huila and Putumayo departments attracted by the timber wealth. The history of the settlement dates back to 1932 when a family named Villalobos entered the area motivated by the extraction of wood. Through this inhospitable place they made their way from Pitalito (Huila) entering the virgin jungle using axes and machetes. Following the largest and mightiest river they were able to open a path and decided to name it with their name. Starting in 1935, motivated by the history of the Villalobos, the first settlers began to arrive and improvised their homes with plastic and boards that they sawed themselves with the aim of exploiting the timber wealth of the place. The inhabitants transported their market on muleback and on foot. In mid-1937, the first hamlet named Santo Domingo was formed, located 5 kilometers from La Línea (or “El Cable”), a bordering place between the departments of Huila and Cauca. . The houses were built with scraps of wood that they sold, they were tiled with straw roofs, which were rustic cardboard that served as Eternit tiles, and the floor was made of dirt.\n\nBy 1948 the population had increased considerably as a result of the beginning of the construction of sections of the highway that would connect Pitalito with Mocoa, in the department of Putumayo. In response to constant fights between the inhabitants, a police station was established with 7 active uniformed officers, under the command of Don Pedro Marín, a resident of Santo Domingo, as police inspector. As the construction of the road progressed, new hamlets or villages were also formed, which is how in 1953 the La Petrolera village was founded, 10 kilometers from Santo Domingo. Constructions were established on both sides of the road with a distance of approximately one kilometer per property. In La Petrolera they founded the school with the same name in 1955 and its first teacher was Alicia Castaño Molina 7 kilometers from La Petrolera, the Santa María village was founded in 1958. The school was founded the following year under the leadership of Professor Carlina Hernández. This path was 6 kilometers long with houses far from each other. In 1960, the Capuchin missionary of Spanish origin, Fray Isidore de Montclar, arrived in the region from the Apostolic Vicariate of Sibundoy in the neighboring department of Putumayo.\nFray Montclar had a fundamental impact on the development and knowledge of the area. He ordered and was in charge of building the schools in cement material or adobes manufactured by himself. In the following years and with the progress of the highway, the San Eduardo, Las Palmeras and San Juan villages were founded in 1967. For 19 years the construction of the road was stopped, facilitating the settlement in San Juan. This last village has stood out for its population since its founding. Geographically, it is located in the middle of the road to Mocoa, which is why it functions as a midpoint between the population that lives in the lower area and the upper area of Media Bota Caucana The San Juan school was founded by teacher Aura Helena Ordóñez in 1968. In 1969, the Redemptorist Father José Restrepo López arrived in the region, through the agreement called 'Contract of National  Schools, the schools belonged to the Vicariate of Sibundoy at that time. He was appointed as parish priest of San Juan and as school inspector for the area. Under the leadership of this priest there were great advances in the region. Due to his profession as a cartographer, he managed to prepare the map of the Municipality of Santa Rosa, highlighting the regions of Villalobos, Mandiyaco (Yanacona de Santa Martha indigenous reservation) and Descanse.\nUsing a map Montclar got attention in Popayán, capital of the department, and made the territory have government recognition. In addition to national funds, he raised economic resources from Germany for the construction of churches and schools. With these resources, the churches of Santa María and San Juan were built, and a vehicle was also purchased to transport between paths and carry out masses. He also created school restaurants.\nFather Restrepo López also organized the Community Action Boards in each village and guided them in achieving their legal status in the Secretariat of the Government of Cauca in Popayán. He had the Santa María and San Juan aqueducts built, with help managed from the Cauca Public Health Institute. Starting in 1987, he founded the towns of Sajonia, Buenos Aires and Betania located between San Juan and the bridge over the Villalobos River, bordering the Mandiyaco sector. He helped the separation of some population that lived in the La Petrolera village and created the La Quebradona village, with its respective school built in material, the first teacher was Alicia Castaño Molina. Father Restrepo López also founded the police inspection of San Juan and before having a building yet he appointed Salomón Silva (the oldest resident of Villalobos) as inspector.\nIn subsequent years, two more trails were created: La Esmeralda, which emerges from the upper part of Santa María, and La Florida, which emerges from the lower part. In the direction of Pitalito – Mocoa the paths are entirely: Santo Domingo, La Petrolera, La Quebradona, La Esmeralda, Santa María, La Florida, San Eduardo, Las Palmeras, San Juan, Sajonia, Buenos Aires and Betania. On October 5, 1992, the Villalobos Agricultural Educational Institution was founded. Its first rector was Delfa Rosalén Cruz Chanchi, later Javier Murillo took over, who serves as rector to this day. The first health post was founded in 1965. Five years later in 1970, with the help of the mayor of Santa Rosa, the municipal health post was opened in San Juan. Parish priests are very important characters within the community. In addition to social work such as building schools and managing resources, they become cultural managers, since the town festivals are organized by the parish and the community.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWood extraction. The large-scale wood extraction was initially the main economic activity of the inhabitants who to settle in the Villalobos. As wood was an abundant resources, the newcomers cut down the trees with which they built their wooden houses roofed with tagua palm leaves, which also grew naturally in the region. The trees were cut down and sold to middlemen who arrived with trucks and loaded them into the interior of the country, to be sold in Cali, Valle del Cauca, to the company Cartones de Colombia, currently owned by the transnational Smurfit Kappa. As a consequence of this long-standing trade, the area was widely deforested, mostly on the banks of the road. At present, this profession is suspended in compliance with laws that prohibit the massive felling of trees for commercial purposes in the interest of protection and conservation of the environment.\nThe lulo bonanza. The elders say that when they first settled in the territory, it rained for a year straight. The land was not suitable for agriculture. They also did not have the knowledge to work on it. Food was brought from Huila on mule back. Year after year, with the trees decimated, the climate was transformed, and one of the endemic plants that they managed to cultivate was the lulo. The lulo grew wild, it didn't need fertilizers or pesticides and didn't require much care. As with wood, they sold their crops to middlemen, who then marketed them in Huila and Valle del Cauca. Economically, the cultivation and harvest of lulo meant the accumulation of capital for the peasant settlers who inhabited the region. With this income, the majority managed to buy the land they lived in, this is the case of some who currently own immense hectares of land; They also managed to build houses with materials, buy dairy cattle, horses and acquire properties in the nearby town of Pitalito, Huila. Also, some of their children were sent to Pitalito to receive quality education. But not everyone managed to make a future with the lulo bonanza. This was a purely masculine occupation, just like wood extraction.he main occupations according to the occupational census are agriculture, private employee, public employee, merchants and loggers, in addition to women housewives who have the largest number with 238, there are also panel workers, recyclers, coffee growers and cane growers.\nThe region's economy moves in three major sectors: agriculture, livestock and wood extraction. The majority of the population subsists on less than a minimum wage. 90% of families work the soil as farmers. Generally, the crops are for family consumption and barter within the community, called subsistence agricultural activities. Very little production is commercialized due to geographical isolation resulting from the lack of transportation routes 79. The inhabitants denounce the decline of agriculture, as a consequence of three factors: 1. the fumigations against illicit crops in the department of Putumayo in 2004 and 2005, 2. forced displacement and 3. the arrival of pests due to progressive global warming, who did not leave a lulo crop standing. In the 1990s, crops for illicit use such as poppies were planted, which, according to the Life Plan, were not successful due to the fact that the climatic conditions were not optimal, and were replaced by lulo crops.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nSan Juan de Villalobos is the only town in Bota Caucana region connected to the national highway system of Colombia, and as a result of this it has established itself as the gateway to the Bota Caucana region, which is one of the most biodiverse destinations of Colombia and attractive for the practice of birdwatching and other ecotourism alternatives.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSan Juan de Villalobos is inhabited by a mixed population, including peasants, Afro-Colombians and indigenous people. According to the census carried out in 2009, the population of San Juan de Villalobos was 733 men and 585 women. The Origin of the inhabitants of San Juan de Villalobos is distributed as follows: 33% from Huila, 31% from Cauca, 11% from Putumayo, 5% from Caquetá, 3% from Nariño, 10% from the rest of the country.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe corregiment of San Juan de Villalobos is located in the south west of the department of Cauca, in the region known as Bota Caucana and is also part of the upper basin of the Caquetá River, which includes the municipalities of San Sebastián, Santa Rosa and Piamonte. Likewise, these become part of the Colombian Massif and the western beginning of the Amazon basin. The region is in turn divided into three subregions named as Alta Bota, Media Bota and Baja Bota.\nThe district of San Juan de Villalobos occupies the region of Media Bota Caucana, which is entirely included in the Municipality of Santa Rosa. There is no road to communicate directly with Santa Rosa, since its only access route to the Department of Cauca is through the Pitalito (Huila) – Mocoa (Putumayo) highway. The section of the Pitalito-Mocoa highway that crosses Media Bota has a length of 48.7 km. \nSan Juan de Villalobos is located on a mountainous sector crossed by the Algeciras fault system and its main line is known as the San Francisco – Yunguillo Fault. Related to the line of this fault, a depression is distinguished where the town of San Juan de Villalobos is located, in which there are quaternary deposits and sedimentary rocks from the cretaceous and paleogene, confined between igneous-metamorphic rocks, by an arrangement of faults. “S” shaped. This depression is interpreted as another lazy S-shaped basin, in a relaxing bend of the main fault. Also striking are the lenses formed inside the basin by faults that affect the sedimentary succession and the folds that appear with axes parallel to the main fault, in accordance with the characteristics of these relaxation curves.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is spirally sulcate with the sulci on first whorls slightly elevated, about 5; on the body whorl 20 or 22, flattened and regularly spaced. The spire is elevated, conic-subpyramidal. The protoconch is large, white, lirate and mammillate. The contains five convex whorls, separated by an impressed suture, especially the earlier ones. The body whorl is large, two-thirds the entire length, slightly swollen, narrowed toward the base, and descending slowly to its termination. The aperture is nearly vertical and semi-ovate. The peristome is nearly straight, slightly thickened, the terminations joined by a very thin white callus. The simple outer lip is well curved. The basal margin is slightly thickened and effuse. The  columellar lip is appressed. The columella is white, thickened, twisted, divided by a superficial groove, prolonged to the base of the aperture. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off Cape Horn, Chile; in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMabille, J.

She was director of nursing at Bellevue and Allied Hospitals in New York, and served overseas in World War I.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRottman was born in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She graduated from Bellevue School of Nursing in 1912. In the early 1920s she received further training in hospital administration at Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRottman was assistant to Clara Noyes after finishing her nurse's training. In 1913 she was named assistant supervisor of nurses at the Indiana University School of Nursing, but she returned to New York in 1914, to take charge of nursing in one of Bellevue's new surgical pavilions. She joined the Bellevue Unit to serve overseas in World War I, as chief surgical nurse at U. S. Evacuation Hospital No. 1. She was cited for meritorious service in the war by General John J. Pershing.\nFrom 1919 to 1921, Rottman was superintendent of nursing at the Johnston Emergency Hospital in Milwaukee. She also worked at Milwaukee's Mount Sinai School of Nursing. In 1925, she returned to Bellevue as director of nursing. In 1929 she was named director of the nursing division in the Department of Hospitals for the City of New York, overseeing nursing services at 26 city hospitals and eight nursing schools.\nRottman was treasurer of the National League of Nursing Education from 1924 to 1934. She was president of the New York Counties Registered Nurses Association.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"High Caloric Feedings for Typhoid Patients\" (1912)\n\"A Health Study in a Nursing School\" (1926, with Laura R. Logan)\n\"Health Education in Schools of Nursing\" (1928)\n\"Distribution of Nursing Service in Hospitals\" (1929)\n\"Affiliations for Nursing Schools: From the Viewpoint of the Receiving Hospital\" (1930)\n\"The Role of the Nursing Service in the Promotion of the Medical and Administrative Aims of the Hospital\" (1931)\n\"Friends of Nursing: Mrs. William Church Osborn\" (1932)\nClinical Education in Nursing (1932, with Blanche Pfefferkorn)\n\"Should a Hospital Close Its Nursing School? And Why?\" (1932)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRottman married hospital superintendent Mark Lance Fleming in 1935, and moved to Florida with him. Her husband died in 1947, and she died in 1955, in her early seventies, in Orlando, Florida. Both Flemings are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its first honorary president was the former Prime Minister, the Earl of Rosebery.\nThe Club coordinates a series of lectures throughout the year on a range of Edinburgh-themes topics and publishes the annual journal, the Book of the Old Edinburgh Club. Further visits and guided walks are organised for members and, additionally, grants and bursaries are awarded to scholars for projects and collaborations relating to Edinburgh’s history.\nThe OEC is a member of the Scottish Local History Forum, and of the British Association for Local History.

The district covers approximately 87 acres (35 ha) of mostly residential area to the west and northwest of the city's commercial core.  The earliest houses in the district date from circa 1870, and are either Greek Revival or Saddlebag cottages.  Beginning in the 1880s, many Victorian cottages were built by employees at the town's cotton mills and iron works.  In the 1920s and 1930s, bungalows continued to be built.  Several commercial buildings, most brick and dating from the 1920s, are scattered throughout the district.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Alice Lair is an American politician from Kansas. In 1982 she served as the first chairwoman of the Kansas Republican Party, and was a long time Republican national committeewoman, representing southeastern Kansas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLair served as the vice-president of the Kansas Republican Party (KSGOP) from starting in 1980. Lair was named the first chairwoman of the KSGOP for three months, from June to August 1982. After this, she again served as vice-president until 1988, when she start to serve as a Republican National Committeewoman until 2000. During this period she was a staunch supporter of both George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Lair voted in the 1993 Republican National Committee voicing her support of traditional, \"broad\", Republicans, instead of caving to pressure from the grassroots religious right, stating that being overtly partisan on the issue of religion would hurt elect-ability. Lair also supported Sam Brownback, and helped work on his 2014 re-election bid, stating that although his tax policies were unpopular at the moment, that they were going to be good for Kansas in the long run.Lair was one of the earliest, and most vocal supporters of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, being one of the few Kansas Republican leaders that backed him over the more traditionally Republican Ted Cruz. Lair stated after the 2016 Kansas Republican presidential caucuses that Trump is \"a force to be reckoned with who can absolutely beat out Clinton, which needs to be the Republicans’ focus\" and that “Trump stands for everything I do\". In 2021, Lair endorsed Derek Schmidt in the 2022 Kansas gubernatorial election, saying that the Democratic party were \"far-left\" and didn't represent the people of Kansas. Lair is also well known in Republican circles for her attendance of every Republican gubernatorial Inaugural ball, often in flashy, patriotic themed, outfits.In the mid-1970s, Lair was one of the founding members of the Kansas Fairgrounds Foundation, which organize the Kansas State Fair. In 2023 she was recognized for over 50 years in service to the foundation, and her ability to use political connections to lobby for funding for the fair in its early years. The foundation stated that without Lair, it is unlikely that the Kansas State Fair would exist in its present form.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThe Lair family, including Mary Alice, were named the Kansas State family of the year for 2022, as 21 living members of the family had graduated from the university. The Lair family attended 6 of the 9 colleges, and are one of the original season ticket holders for the Wildcats.\n\n\n== References ==",

In some parts the furrows seem to be crossed by delicate bars. The interspaces are flat. There are five whorls, which have a distinct, square shoulder; the body whorl is tumid, the upper one plane. The aperture is lunate, about three-fifths the length of the shell. The columella, about one-third the length of the aperture, is flat, \nand divided by a single groove. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off Argentina and the Falkland Islands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGould, A.

        "content": "Soho Suites is a two-CD album by guitarist Derek Bailey and percussionist Tony Oxley. The music on disc one was recorded at a studio in Soho, London, during February 1977, while disc two documents a live session at the Knitting Factory in New York City on September 19, 1995. The album was released in 1997 by Incus Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek wrote: \"To play these CDs in sequence is quite remarkable. For those who have followed the careers of both men over the decades, it will be astonishing to hear what has been taken for granted in the development not only of their individual styles and approaches to improvisation, but in the actual evolution of those methods as they reach deeper into the musical muck for a kind of meaning that can only be generated in this type of musical pursuit... This is an awesome set, so strong it's better than 90 percent of what's out there passing for free improvisation. Just get it.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings awarded the album a full 4 stars, and stated: \"these extraordinary sides roll back the years like nobody's business... these two discs seem to pass by in moments, when in fact they are among the most substantial performances from either man in recent years.\"\nSeymour Wright of The Wire described the music as \"an aggregate wealth of rational invention, sonic resources, traditions broached, instrumental control, and dry, tender, wry play.\" He commented: \"Listen to the mix of acoustic and amplified sounds, and almost infinite attacks, combinations and decays of sounds across the Soho Suites... There's a zooming-in-and-out-of sonic proportion, tempers, physicalities, and unfolding of time at play that is remarkable and typical of Oxley and Bailey's work.\"\nA reviewer for Hi-Fi News remarked: \"Alternately sentimental and aggressive, this is very serious fun: musicians asking each other what the point is of it all, without relenting. Veteran players who risk more as they age? This bucks the clichés with vengeance. Shattering.\"\nAuthor Ben Watson contrasted Bailey's \"pointillist delicacy\" on disc 1 with his \"scything metal attack\" on the second disc, and noted Oxley's \"gorgeously reverberant and organic\" sound. He wrote: \"the way that time appears to stand still, opening up myriad extra pockets for fountains of variegated guitar and percussion sounds, has a similar quality on both discs, even though the two duos were recorded eighteen years apart.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDisc 1\n\"Carlisle\" – 22:04\n\"Wardour\" – 2:49\n\"Berwick\" – 3:15\n\"Beak\" – 17:01\nDisc 2\n\"Rivington\" – 17:40\n\"Kenmare\" – 13:00\n\"Lafayette\" – 3:40\n\"Grand\" – 3:30\n\"Lispenard\" – 15:40\n\"Leonard\" – 3:10\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDerek Bailey – acoustic guitar, electric guitar\nTony Oxley – percussion, violin\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a senior honorary research fellow in the Department of African Studies and Anthropology at the University of Birmingham, England.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBrydon studied social anthropology at New Hall (now Murray Edwards College, Cambridge), changing to this after one year studying natural sciences. After graduating in 1971 she spent a year teaching in Ghana with VSO, and then returned to Cambridge for her doctoral studies. Her thesis, completed after 16 months of fieldwork, was \"Status ambiguity in Amedzofe-Avatime: women and men in a changing patrilineal society\" (1976).\n\n\n== Career ==\nBrydon was a junior research fellow at Sidney Sussex College from 1975 to 1977, then a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Liverpool before moving to the University of Birmingham's Centre of West African Studies (CWAS) in 1996.\nCWAS became the Department of African Studies and Anthropology (DASA), and Brydon was its director in 2007-2008 when it became a member of AEGIS, the Africa-Europe Group for Interdisciplinary Studies. She was appointed as senior lecturer in 1998, and in 2008 became head of the School of History and Cultures when the university restructured its departments.\nShe was co-editor of the journal Ghana Studies, along with Takyiwaa Manuh, from 2003 to 2009, and was on the editorial board of Review of African Political Economy from the mid-1990s until 2008.\nHer 1989 book Women in the Third World: gender issues in rural and urban areas, co-authored with Sylvia Chant, was originally compiled as teaching material for Liverpool social science finalists, and covers \"a broad range of women' s issues across continents and regions\", and covers four main themes of the household, reproduction, production, and policy.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nBrydon, Lynne; Chant, Sylvia (1989).

        "content": "\"Pola sunca\" is a song by Serbian singer Marija Šerifović taken from her sixth studio album Dolazi ljubav (2023). The song was written by Bane Opačić, produced by Dušan Alagić and the arrangement was finalized by Alagić and Dušan Krsmanović. Croatian singer Matija Cvek serves as a featured artist. It was released as a single on 6 October 2023. Upon its release, it was met with very positive reviews from listeners, some of whom compared Cvek's vocal performance to that of Toše Proeski. It was also commercially successful, peaking at number 3 on the Croatia Songs chart by Billboard.\nA music video for the song was directed by Hamper Digital and released on 6 October 2023. It features the duo singing the song, Cvek dressed in white and Šerifović in black. The video quickly became trending and garnered over 1 million views in 2 days on the video-streaming platform YouTube. To further promote the song, each artist spoke about it during their televised appearances on the show Kec na jedanaest.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn late 2023, Matija Cvek was contacted by Serbian singer Marija Šerifović to collaborate with her on a song. After careful consideration, the two decided to record the song \"Pola sunca\" taken from the latter's sixth studio album Dolazi ljubav (2023) as a collaboration. The decision to work together came after Šerifović contacted Cvek on the phone demanding that they meet up. He then travelled to Belgrade where the two met up; following a brief performance of the song by Šerifović and a brief review of each other's repertoire, they decided to proceed with recording the \"demanding\" song. Cvek found the lyrics to be relatable, its balladry to be reminiscent of the \"big Balkan ballads\" that harken back to his childhood. He also expressed his hopes that the song would \"open doors\" for him for a career path in Serbia.\nWhile singing the song, both listeners and Cvek's fans noted the similarities in his vocal performance to that of Macedonian singer Toše Proeski which he himself, also acknowledged during an interview and cited it as a possible influence to being exposed to his music.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\n\n\n=== Music video ===\nAn accompanying music video directed by Hamper Digital was released on 6 October 2023. The clip featured around 40 people on set and Cvek revealed how the atmosphere could be \"demanding\" but very professional. At the time of filming, he also saw the role he was playing in the video as \"challenging\". For the clip, Cvek appears dressed in a white Marko Feher suit. Throughout, Šerifović is seen dressed in a black suit and both are seen singing the song looking at the camera. Additionally, one shot of the video features a naked Cvek who is shown from the back with wax and two candles on his skin. The music video was very popular on the video streaming platform YouTube where it garnered over 1 million views in two days. As of April 2024, the music video has over 9.4 million views on the platform, 5 months since its release.\n\n\n=== Televised appearances ===\nThe duo, separately, made televised appearances on the Serbian show Kec na jedanaest; Šerifović made an appearance on 15 October 2023 while Cvek made an appearance on 24 November 2023. When speaking about the decision on Cvek, Šerifović said that she was looking for the qualities \"fresh, honest, valuable and of high quality\" to mix with her own love for music, to which Cvek came as a \"logical choice\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nThe single was very commercially successful, peaking at number one in both Croatia and Serbia; discussing his views on the fact that the song, which was slightly different from other trending songs found its way among the audience, Cvek described it as \"atypical\" and something that caught him by surprise.\nThe single was very commercially successful, peaking at number three on Billboard's Croatia Songs for the week ending 21 October 2023. The following week, it moved to the position of number four.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Credits ==\nCredits are adapted from the description of the music video on YouTube.\n\nSong credits\nMusic by: Bane Opačić\nLyrics by: Bane Opačić\nArranged by: Dušan Alagić, Dušan Krsmanović\nProduced by: Dušan Alagić\nDrums: Mladen Dragović\nKeys / Guitars / Programming / Violin: Dušan Alagić\nProgramming, keys: Dušan Krsmanović\nRecorded, mixed and mastered: Strahinja Đurić for Late Night Studio Belgrade, 2023.\nVideo credits\nProduction: Hamper Digital\nExecutive production: Qlaack\nArt director & Director: Miloš Šarović\nDirector of Photography: Marko Kažić\nProduction design: Miloš Radovanović\nCostume designer: Marko Feher\n1st AD: Sara Vulović\nProducer: Dušan Mladenović / Qlaack\nProduction manager: Ana Mesaroš / Qlaack\nPA: Sofija Šokčić / Qlaack\nEditor: Matija Novaković\nColor Grade: Goran Todorić\nVFX: Merlin Studio\nGraphic design: Haris Jusović\nPhotographer: Miomir Milić\nAss.

        "content": "Nemesis at Raynham Parva is a 1929 detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington. It is the fifth in his series of seventeen novels featuring the Golden Age Detective Sir Clinton Driffield. It was published in the United States by Little, Brown and Company under the alternative title Grim Vengeance.\nIt is a Country house mystery, a genre at its height during the interwar years. Connington possibly intended this to be the last Driffield novel, because it had shown Sir Clinton briefly crossing over to the other side of the law. Connington switched to a new series character Superintendent Ross for his next two novels, before bringing back Sir Clinton in a fresh story The Boathouse Riddle in 1931. Once again he is a Chief Constable and no mention of the events at Raynham Parva. In the following eleven stories he never behaves so high-handedly as he did in this case. The author later describe it as \"rather a poor one\" when assessing his works.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nReturning from a visit abroad Sir Clinton, recently having resigned from his post as Chief Constable, goes to stay at his widowed sister's rented country estate at Raynham Parva near a small village of the same name. He is concerned to discover that his niece has got married while he was away, not to Rex the likeable young man she has long been involved with but instead to Vicente Francia, a smooth-mannered Argentine. In just six weeks Francia is planning to take his niece away to Buenos Aires for good, taking away with her three other young English woman friends who are to accompany her to help her settle in to the new country.\nSir Clinton is called soon afterwards to give some assistance to Sergeant Ledbury of the local police on what looks like an accidental death in a car crash with the victim having gone headfirst through the windscreen. Sir Clinton quickly establishes that is in fact a murder cleverly disguised to make it look like an accident. Furthermore, the man was another South American, a vague business associate of Francia. Complicating matters is the presence of another Argentine, Doctor Roca staying at the local inn. Sir Clinton recognises him as a man who has worked for the League of Nations tackling people smuggling. Sir Clinton suspects that he has come to England in pursuit of the gang and has taken the law into his own hands and killed a man while disguising it as an accident.\nWhen the doctor is found shot dead at a local megalithic structure, Sir Clinton is confirmed in his view that Francia is one of the smugglers, plotting to take the four young woman and sell them into White slavery across the Atlantic. He is caught in a dilemma of whether to expose Francia in England or in South America, where it may cause less scandal for his niece's reputation, ot take more drastic steps. When Francia is found shot dead in a room at Raynham Parva, it becomes clear that Sir Clinton himself has connived at his murder. Sergeant Ledbury is then steered onto entirely the wrong scent.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarzun, Jacques & Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime.

        "content": "Khoshak Zakarian, also Khuashak , Khvashak or Xvashak (born circa 1235, died after 1299), was a female member of the Zakarid dynasty of Armenian Prince in the 14th century CE. She was the daughter of Avag Zakarian, an important Prince, Lord High Constable of Georgia, and Gvantsa, a noblewoman who went on to become queen of Georgia. She was the granddaughter of Ivane I Zakarian (commander of Georgian-Armenian forces in the early 13th century).\nAfter her father died, she was put under the protection of Sadun Artsruni, the powerful Atabeg (Governor General) of Georgia, who acted as a chamberlain to her.\nKhoshak was married to Shams al-Din Juvayni, a Persian statesman and member of the Juvayni family in 1269. He was an influential figure in early Ilkhanate politics, serving as Sahib-i divan (vizier and minister of finance) under four Mongol Ilkhans – Hulagu, Abaqa, Tekuder and Arghun Khan. He was the most powerful official of the Il-khanate. Khoshak was possibly looking for a powerful guarantor in the person of Shams al-Din Juvayni, as she was being left out of her father's inheritance following the remarriage of her mother Gvantsa with the king of Georgia David VII.\nKhoshak moved to Persia in 1271—72, and lived there with her husband for 15 years. They had a girl named Kuandze \"Born from Princes\" in Persian), who ultimately married the Armenian Prince Shahnshah II Zakarian, and two sons named Zakare and Atabeg. She returned to her father’s house with her children in 1285, after her husband was behaded by the Mongol ruler in 1284. \nKhoshak is known for leaving an inscription in Armenian at Garni Temple. The large Armenian inscription was left on entryway by Princess Khoshak and Khoshak's son, Amir Zakare, in 1291. It records the release of the people of Garni from taxes in forms of wine, goats, and sheep.\nHer son Atabeg died in 1289, and Zakare inherited his parents' estate. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKitagawa, Sei-ichi'.

It is white and not polished. The surface is covered with sharp, deep, close set, spiral grooves minutely punctate at the bottom. The shell contains three whorls, beside the prominent, polished, smooth, globular, sinistral protoconch. The suture is distinct and not channelled. The outer lip is thin and simple. The body of the shell shows a thin wash of callus. The columella is short, thin, very much twisted, so that its outer edge presents a plait-like appearance, while the shell seems almost canaliculate, though the columella is continuous with the basal margin. Above the twisted edge and separated from it by a deep channel is a second less prominent plait.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off Chile.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Despite claims it is the largest boomable stiff-leg-derrick barge on the eastern seaboard of the United States, Left Coast Lifter, which was used for the assembly of the replacement Tappan Zee Bridge, can lift nearly double the capacity.\nThe barge measures 191 feet (58 m) long, with a beam of 101 feet (31 m); its draft is 20 feet (6.1 m).\nSince late March 2024, it has been involved in salvage efforts at Baltimore, following the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe crane barge was built by Kelso Marine in Galveston, Texas for Sun Shipbuilding in 1972 at a cost of nearly $5 million. At the time, it was the largest crane ship in the world. The crane was initially able to lift 800 short tons (710 long tons; 730 t), and so was named Sun 800.\nIn 1982, Sun's parent, the Sun Oil Company, sold Sun Shipbuilding to Ed Paden, who renamed the business to Pennsylvania Shipbuilding (Penn Ship); yard assets were renamed similarly, and the crane was renamed Penn 800. While en-route to Puerto Rico in the mid-1980s, the derrick barge was caught in a hurricane and the original boom was lost; it was replaced with a boom measuring 256 ft (78 m) long (heel to jib) and the main fall block was upgraded to a 35-ton unit, which increased the lifting capacity to 1,000 short tons (910 t) and the vessel was renamed Penn 1000. Tim Colton, who was the Vice President of Marketing for Penn Ship, stated the engineers originally had designed the crane to be upgraded to 1000 tons; however, after the upgrade, it sat idle most of the time, so the crane was moved to the busier Port of Norfolk, Virginia and renamed Chesapeake 1000.: 111–112 \nIn 1989, the United States Navy acquired a preferred mortgage on the floating crane as a performance guarantee for a contract to build five oil tankers, which had been awarded in 1984. After Penn Ship was unable to complete the contract, the crane barge was sold to Maritime Capital Corp, which subsequently sold it to Donjon, but the transfer was complicated by the pre-existing Navy encumbrance. The Navy released Penn Ship from its obligations in 1992, and it was renamed to its current name, Chesapeake 1000, after the acquisition was completed by Donjon Marine in 1993.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nSun 800 was built for heavy lifts, specifically the gimbal platforms and bearings,: 14  during the construction of Glomar Explorer, which was the centerpiece of Project Azorian, a  CIA project that aimed to recover Soviet submarines during the Cold War. In 1975, Sun 800 was used to recover the 79 ft (24 m) tugboat Saratoga from the Delaware River, which had sunk after being rammed by the ship it was towing. By 1978, the heaviest lift recorded by Sun 800 was a 785-short-ton (712 t) deckhouse. In 1979, it was used to help raise the stricken barge Elizabeth Turner. Sun 800 was used for heavy lifts during the demolition of the central vertical lift spans of the CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge in 1981, removing 4,500 short tons (4,100 t) of steel in one week.\nUnder Donjon, which was based in Hillside, Pennsylvania, it removed a derelict steel trestle railroad bridge to Petty Island in 1991. The Chesapeake 1000 was used in construction of the Confederation Bridge between 1993-1997 and also participated in the 1996 salvage of the Irving Whale. After relocating its home port to Port Newark, it also has assisted in the 2016 construction of a 960 ft-long (290 m) laboratory building for Rockefeller University, and lifted and landed seven units to create a 485 ft-long (148 m), single-story platform for New York Hospital in 1995. In 2016, Chesapeake 1000 was used to recover the 84 ft (26 m) tug Specialist, which sank in the Hudson River on March 12, killing three.\nFollowing the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Chesapeake 1000 and Weeks 533 were dispatched to the Port of Baltimore; they will be used first to clear several sections of the wrecked bridge and establish a temporary shipping channel, then to remove the bridge sections pinning MV Dali, and finally to remove the remaining bridge trusses outside the temporary channel. On March 30, 2024, the first section of the bridge was lifted.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeft Coast Lifter, largest sheerleg crane barge on the East Coast\nWeeks 533 (ex-Marine Boss), largest revolving floating crane on the East Coast\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nKavanagh, David. \"The SUN 800 Floating Derrick Crane\".

        "content": "Mysouffa cumingii is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\n(Described as Actaeon cumingii) The oval shell is subcylindrical. it is flesh colored. The spire is exserted. The convex whorls are transversely sulcate, the sulci beautifully cancellated, longitudinally striated. The columella shows a single fold below. The aperture is white inside. The outer lip is acute and subsinuous above. \nThis differs from Acteon delicatus by its stumpier form, coarser and ruder subcancellate striation, more prominent fold on the columella and particularly by its protoconch which, though small, is swollen and set on the peek of a very acute spire like a swollen terminal bud on a twig. In A. delicatus the protoconch, instead of appearing larger, is considerably smaller than the whorl in front of it, in which it is also partially immersed.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil; in the Caribbean Sea off Panama, Guadeloupe, the Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRosenberg, G.; Moretzsohn, F.; García, E.

        "content": "Rumpelnacht (translated: Night of Chaos or Night of Transition) is a term used by some Ashkenazi Jews for the night of 22 Nisan (the evening after the seventh day of Passover in Israel) or the night of 23 Nisan (the evening after the last day of Passover outside of Israel). \nThe expression in German means \"Night of Transition\", and it refers to the packing and storing of Passover utensils, and simultaneously the return of Chametz utensils into the home for use. The term \"Rumpelnacht\", which means \"Night of Chaos\", expresses the end of the Passover holiday in contrast to \"Seder Night\", which is the beginning of Passover. This night has earned a special nickname because it is characterized by urgency and special swiftness. Many families hurry to store the Passover utensils before bringing any Chametz into their homes. Therefore, on the evening after the holiday, they do not eat Chametz unless they go out to eat outside their home. In Germany, the end of the 'Rumpel' was marked by drinking beer.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was provincial head of Industries and Agrarian Marketing in A Coruña, part of the Ministry of Agriculture.Through her work she took spoke at and attended international industry technical congresses and conferences on Agricultural Industries and Commercialisation.Pérez-Soba was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Colexio Oficial de Enxeñeiros Agrónomos de Galicia (College of Agronomists of Galicia), being acting as Secretary of the organisation between 1962 and 1976.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 10 November 1961 in Madrid, María Luisa Pérez-Soba married Pedro Fernández Rico, a doctor and agricultural engineer at YRIDA in Coruña. The couple had three children: Pedro, a commercial technician; Álvaro, an agricultural engineer and secondary school teacher; and Gonzalo, a journalist.María Luisa Pérez-Soba died on 8 February 2021 in A Coruña.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2021, Pérez-Soba was honoured by the gender equality commission of the Escola Politécnica Superior de Enxeñaría e da Facultade de Ciencias of University of Santiago de Compostela.\n\n\n== References ==",

One-third of the 36 members of Hartlepool Borough Council in County Durham will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHartlepool was a traditionally Labour-controlled council. The party held control of the council from its creation as a unitary authority in 1995 to 2000, from 2004 to 2008, and 2010 to 2019, with periods of no overall control between. Following the 2019 election, the Conservatives, the Independent Union, and the Veterans and People's Party formed a minority coalition. This agreement, minus the VPP, was renewed following the 2021 election on new boundaries. \nIn the previous election, Labour won 9 seats (up 5) with 44.6% of the vote, the Conservatives won 2 (down 1) with 22.6%, independents won 1 (down 3) with 20.6%, and the Independent Union lost the seat they were defending with 3.1%. Following the election, the Conservatives, the Independent Union, and 5 independents formed a minority coalition. As the 2021 election was for all seats, this election is for the seats held by the first place candidate in each ward. The Conservatives are defending 7 seats, Labour are defending 1, and independents are defending 4.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nJuly 2023: Steve Wallace leaves Labour to sit as an independent\n\n\n== Results By Ward ==\n\n\n=== Burn Valley ===\n\n\n=== De Bruce ===\n\n\n=== Fens and Greatham ===\n\n\n=== Foggy Furze ===\n\n\n=== Hart ===\n\n\n=== Headland and Harbour ===\n\n\n=== Manor House ===\n\n\n=== Rossmere ===\n\n\n=== Rural West ===\n\n\n=== Seaton ===\n\n\n=== Throston ===\n\n\n=== Victoria ===\n\n\n== References ==",

Rhodes supported the album, his first for Stony Plain Records, with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduced by Bob Greenlee, the album was recorded at King Snake Studios, in Florida. Rhodes wrote or cowrote 10 of its songs; his writing was influenced primarily by Percy Mayfield. \"Beside Myself\" is an instrumental. \"Too Much Trouble\" is about juvenile gun violence. \"Life's Rainbow\" was written by Copeland. The album concludes with a 20-minute interview with Rhodes.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Gazette wrote that \"Rhodes plays most of his leads on a lap steel guitar, an instrument much more common in country music... In his hands though, the lap steel is about as blue as B.B. King's Lucille.\" The Star Tribune said that \"Rhodes can deliver a big, tender ballad just as well as a funky bar shuffle.\" The Edmonton Journal praised \"the raspy, but at times tender, at times sneering, vocals of Rhodes, and his stinging and slicing lap steel guitar playing.\"\nThe Times Colonist opined that \"it's the best work in the musician's long recording career, but it only hints at the power of Sonny Rhodes's live show.\" The Asbury Park Press listed Blue Diamond as the seventh best blues album of 1999, writing that Rhodes \"showcases his masterful lyrical ideas and backs it up with blistering guitar playing and intricate lap steel treatments.\" The Province determined that Rhodes \"knows how to put an album together but still sounds like a guy best seen live.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Annie Mabel Sandes (3 December 1881 – 19 June 1966) was an Australian technical-college superintendent. She was the founding principal of what was later called the Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSandes was born in 1881 in Cleveland. Both of her parents Annie Jane (born Goudy) and James Sandes were immigrants from Ireland. Her father was in the police and she had two elder siblings and one of them was Francis Percival Sandes who became a professor of surgery. She studied art and later cookery at Sydney Technical College where she was later employed.\nMelbourne's College of Domestic Science (later called the Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy) was founded in 1906 with Sandes as its superintendent. £1600 had been found to create it after the Australian Institute of Domestic Economy had demonstrated the need with a couple of years of talks. She was appointed in June and the college opened in October. She taught classes in the day and in the evenings and ran all aspects of the college including establishing curriculums, building maintenance and marking examinations. It was not until 1911 that the college began to train domestic science teachers although the college's students had already been selling the meals that they cooked to raise funds for the college. Sandes had her wages increased only after she resigned in protest in 1912, but she was also given additional responsibilities.\nShe finally left in 1916 to marry and the local paper lauded her contributions to the college. She married another teacher, Stanley Clifton Smith.\n\"Mrs Clifton Smith\" taught at St Catherine's School in Waverley. She taught domestic science and dressmaking from 1938 until she retired in 1944 having increasing problems with her hearing.\nSandes died in Korobosea while travelling in 1966.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "The chromosomal theory of cancer is a fundamental concept in cancer biology that suggests cancer is caused by genetic changes, particularly alterations in the structure or number of chromosomes in cells. These changes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, a hallmark of cancer.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nThe theory originated from the work of Theodor Boveri, a German biologist, in the early 20th century. Boveri's studies on sea urchin eggs provided early evidence that abnormal chromosome numbers could lead to developmental defects, leading him to propose a connection between chromosomal abnormalities and cancer.\nFurther research by scientists such as David Hungerford and Peter Nowell in the 1960s identified specific chromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells, such as the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, providing more support for the chromosomal theory of cancer.\n\n\n== Key concepts ==\nNormal cells have a precise and stable number of chromosomes, which is crucial for proper cell function and division. Chromosomes contain genes that control cell growth, differentiation, and other cellular processes.\nCancer cells often exhibit chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosomal rearrangements (such as translocations), deletions, and duplications. These abnormalities can disrupt the normal function of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n\n\n== Mechanisms ==\nChromosomal abnormalities can contribute to cancer development through several mechanisms,\n\n\n=== Activation of oncogenes ===\nChromosomal rearrangements can lead to the fusion of genes, creating oncogenes that promote cell growth and division uncontrollably.\n\n\n=== Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes ===\nChromosomal deletions or mutations can lead to the loss of tumor suppressor genes, which normally inhibit cell growth. Loss of these genes can further promote uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n\n\n=== Genomic instability ===\nChromosomal abnormalities can cause genomic instability, leading to additional mutations and genetic changes that contribute to cancer progression.\n\n\n== Experimental evidence ==\nExperimental studies using cell lines, animal models, and human cancer samples have provided strong evidence supporting the chromosomal theory of cancer. These studies have demonstrated that chromosomal abnormalities can drive tumorigenesis and are often associated with specific types of cancer.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\nChromosomal analysis, such as karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is commonly used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis to detect chromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells.\nTargeted therapies, such as imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer, have been developed based on the specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with these cancers.\n\n\n== Current research and future directions ==\nCurrent research in cancer genetics is focused on further understanding the role of chromosomal abnormalities in cancer development and progression. Advances in technology, such as next-generation sequencing, are enabling researchers to study chromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells with greater detail and precision.\nFuture directions include the development of new targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches based on the specific chromosomal abnormalities present in individual patients' tumors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHow chromosome imbalances can drive cancer\nChromosomal abnormalities in cancer\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alejandro Serani Burgos (May 3, 1901 – March 23, 1982) was a Chilean lawyer and politician. He served as an intendant, legislator, and minister of state during the governments of Presidents Arturo Alessandri and Gabriel González Videla. He was a Freemason, serving as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Chile from 1954 to 1957.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSerani was born in Antuco on May 3, 1901, the son of Ceferino Serani Di Cocco and Magdalena Burgos Binet, both of European descent.He completed his primary and secondary education at the Liceo de Hombres de Temuco, and pursued higher education at the Pedagogical Institute and the Law School of the University of Chile. He obtained a degree in mathematics in 1924 and received his law degree on November 20, 1928. His thesis focused on Theories on the Investigation of Crimes. During his university years, he held positions as president, vice president, and secretary of the Law and Pedagogy Student Centers. He was also director of the University of Chile Student Federation (FECh).He worked as a teacher at the Liceos of Los Andes and San Felipe, served as vice-rector of the Night Liceo Federico Hansen, and held the position of rector at the Liceos of Rengo and Los Ángeles.Among other activities, he was secretary and member of the Ateneo of the Liceo de Temuco; Boy Scouts of Bío-Bío; and a member of the League of Poor Students. He also served as president of the International Labour Conference held in Santiago, Chile.He was married twice, first to Marta Martelli Devia, with whom he had three children: César, Mario, and Patricio. After being widowed, he married Guilda Mostazal González in Santiago on June 18, 1962, with whom he had two children: Nancy and Jorge Alejandro.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSerani was a member of the Democrat Party and in 1941, he participated in its merger with the Democratic Party, which was split in 1952 for the presidential elections, during which Serani was part of its leadership, but he did not return to party activity afterward.During Carlos Dávila's provisional presidency, he was appointed intendant of the Biobío Province on June 30, 1932, but resigned from the position in July of the same year.In the parliamentary elections of 1932, he was elected as a deputy for the Nineteenth Departmental Group (corresponding to the departments of Angol, Laja, and Mulchén) for the legislative period of 1933–1937. He did not complete his parliamentary term because he accepted the position of minister of state, and in his place, Pedro Hernán Freeman Caris was incorporated on June 25 of the same year.During the government of liberal President Arturo Alessandri, he was appointed Minister of Labour, a position he held from April 19, 1934, to March 31, 1936. On this date, he was appointed Minister of National Assets, serving until January 15, 1937. Finally, he was appointed Minister of Justice on March 24, 1937, serving until August 6 of the same year.During the government of radical President Pedro Aguirre Cerda, he was appointed as government delegate director to the Compañía de Teléfonos de Chile, a position from which he resigned on February 3, 1939.On August 8, 1950, he assumed the position of Minister of Labour for the second time, serving until July 29, 1952, under the administration of fellow radical President Gabriel González Videla.In the parliamentary elections of 1957, he ran for senator for Atacama and Coquimbo for the 1957–1965 term but was not elected.\n\n\n== Later activities ==\nOn May 5, 1956, Serani was appointed professor of civil law at the Law School of the University of Chile, a position he held until 1982. He was also a member of the General Council of the Bar Association, a seat he held until his death.He worked as a forestry entrepreneur, acquiring the \"El Trapiche\" estate near Coipue, in the commune of Curepto,  in the early 1950s.He was also a Freemason, elected as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Chile on June 4, 1954, and re-elected for a new term in 1956, but he resigned from the position, which was accepted by the Grand Lodge Council on June 17, 1957. During his tenure, the Masonic Constitution in force since November 1, 1955, was promulgated, and Decree No. 318 of 1955 was issued, establishing the Masonic Instruction Program for the three symbolic degrees.Serani owned the newspaper El Ideal de Mulchén and received the Order of Isabella the Catholic.He passed away on March 23, 1982, in Santiago.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The exploration of ancient Georgian place names reveals a rich tapestry of cultural, religious, and historical influences that have shaped the country's geographic nomenclature over millennia. The historical overview of these place names uncovers their deep roots in Georgia's past, from the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia to the profound impact of Christianity and the complex interplay with neighboring empires such as the Roman, Persian, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. These interactions have left indelible marks on the landscape, embedding religious, cultural, and political narratives into the very names of places across Georgia.\nThe influence of religion, particularly Christianity, on Georgian place names is significant. This religious heritage is evident in the naming of cities, towns, and natural features after saints, religious figures, and biblical events, serving as a testament to the deep spiritual roots and devotion of the Georgian people.\nMoreover, the presence of Georgian place names in Turkey highlights the historical connections and shared heritage between these regions. Despite the process of \"Turkification,\" many place names retain their Georgian origins, pointing to the complex history of territorial changes, migrations, and cultural exchanges.\nThe Roman influence on Georgian place names, while less direct, is a reminder of the ancient interactions between the Roman Empire and the Georgian kingdoms. This influence is seen in the adoption of Roman architectural and urban planning concepts, as well as in the cultural exchanges that occurred during this period.\nSignificant ancient Georgian cities such as Mtskheta, Kutaisi, Uplistsikhe, Vani, and Tbilisi are emblematic of the country's rich history. These cities, with their ancient fortifications, religious monuments, and archaeological sites, serve as living testimonies to Georgia's diverse cultural heritage and historical significance.\nModern Georgian place names with ancient origins further illustrate the continuity and evolution of the country's geographic nomenclature. Names such as Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Mtskheta, Uplistsikhe, and Batumi carry forward the legacy of the past, bridging ancient traditions with contemporary identity.\n\n\n== Historical overview ==\nThe history of Georgian place names encapsulates the profound interplay between the country's rich historical legacy, cultural evolution, and diverse geography. Tracing their origins to ancient times, these names bear witness to Georgia's storied past, from the early kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia to the influences of major empires like the Roman, Persian, Byzantine, and Ottoman. The introduction of Christianity as the state religion in the early 4th century further enriched the tapestry of place names, with many sites named after saints and biblical events. Additionally, the natural beauty of Georgia, from the towering Caucasus Mountains to the verdant valleys, has inspired place names that reflect the country's varied topography. The linguistic characteristics of the Georgian language, part of the unique Kartvelian language family, have also contributed to the distinctiveness of these names. This article explores the multifaceted origins and significances of Georgian place names, illustrating how they serve as a window into the historical events, cultural shifts, and natural landscapes that have sculpted Georgia into the nation it is today.\n\n\n== Influence of religion on place names ==\nThe influence of religion on place names in Georgia is a reflection of the country's profound and enduring spiritual heritage. Since the adoption of Christianity as the state religion in the early 4th century AD, religious beliefs have significantly shaped the nomenclature of Georgian locales, embedding religious symbolism and reverence into the very fabric of the geographic landscape.\nThe conversion of Georgia to Christianity is traditionally attributed to Saint Nino in the 330s AD, marking a pivotal moment in the nation's history. This event not only transformed the spiritual life of the Georgian people but also initiated a profound transformation in the naming of places across the country. Cities, towns, and even natural features began to be named or renamed to reflect Christian values, stories, and figures.\nOne of the most evident manifestations of this influence is the prevalence of place names derived from saints and religious figures. For example, numerous churches, monasteries, and settlements bear the names of saints who are venerated in the Georgian Orthodox Church. These names serve not only as geographical markers but also as constant reminders of the spiritual heritage and religious devotion of the Georgian people.\nMoreover, the names of many Georgian places are directly associated with biblical events and figures. This is indicative of the deep interweaving of religious narratives with the cultural and social fabric of the country. The ancient capital of Mtskheta, for instance, is replete with religious significance, hosting several of the country's most sacred and revered religious sites. Its name, while predating Christianity, has become synonymous with Georgian Christianity due to the city's central role in the spread of the faith.\nIn addition to Christian influences, the religious landscape of Georgia has been shaped by its interactions with neighboring cultures and religions over the centuries. This has led to a rich tapestry of place names that reflect a diverse array of religious traditions and beliefs. However, the dominant influence of Christianity on place names is unmistakable and serves as a testament to the religion's central role in Georgian identity and history.\nThe naming of places after religious figures and events is not merely a matter of historical curiosity; it reflects the ongoing importance of faith in the lives of the Georgian people. These names encapsulate stories of faith, perseverance, and devotion that continue to inspire and guide the nation.\nIn conclusion, the influence of religion on place names in Georgia is a vivid illustration of the country's spiritual journey. From ancient times to the present, the interplay between geography and religion has created a landscape rich in religious symbolism and meaning. These place names stand as enduring monuments to Georgia's deep-rooted Christian heritage and its continuing influence on the nation's cultural and spiritual life.\n\n\n== Georgian place names in Turkey ==\nThe historical interconnections between Georgia and Turkey have led to the presence of Georgian place names within the modern borders of Turkey. These names are remnants of a complex history of territorial changes, migrations, and cultural exchanges between the two regions. The influence of Georgian culture and language in certain areas of Turkey is a testament to the shared history and interactions that have shaped the identities of both nations.\nHistorically, the regions now known as Georgia and Turkey have been at the crossroads of various empires and civilizations, including the Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian Empires. These powers often contested the territory due to its strategic importance and rich cultural heritage. As a result, the borders of Georgia have shifted over the centuries, leaving behind Georgian communities and place names in what is now Turkish territory.\nThe process of \"Turkification\" of Georgian place names has been noted, where original Georgian names were adapted or changed to fit the Turkish language and phonetic system. This process was part of broader policies of cultural assimilation and administrative reorganization under various Turkish rulers. Despite these changes, many of the original Georgian names still bear resemblance to their origins, retaining elements of the Georgian language and nomenclature.\nOne of the key factors contributing to the presence of Georgian place names in Turkey is the historical region of Tao-Klarjeti. This area, which is now part of northeastern Turkey, was once a core part of the medieval Georgian kingdom. Many churches, monasteries, and fortresses in this region bear Georgian architectural and linguistic marks, reflecting the area's Georgian Christian heritage. The names of these historical sites often preserve the Georgian names, serving as a testament to the region's past.\nFurthermore, migrations and population movements have played a significant role in the spread of Georgian place names across the border into Turkey. Throughout history, Georgians have migrated to Turkey for various reasons, including economic opportunities, political instability, and forced relocations. These communities brought with them their language and cultural practices, including the naming of places after Georgian towns, saints, and historical figures.\nIn contemporary times, the study and preservation of Georgian place names in Turkey have gained interest among historians, linguists, and cultural preservationists. These efforts aim to document and understand the historical connections between Georgia and Turkey, as well as to preserve the cultural heritage represented by these names.\nIn conclusion, Georgian place names in Turkey are a reflection of the historical, cultural, and linguistic ties between the two regions. These names serve as markers of a shared past, highlighting the complex interplay of cultures, languages, and histories that have shaped the identities of both Georgia and Turkey. The preservation and study of these place names are crucial for understanding the rich tapestry of cultural interactions in the Caucasus and Anatolia regions.\n\n\n== Roman Influence on Georgian Place Names ==\nThe Roman influence on Georgian place names is an intriguing aspect of the historical interactions between the Roman Empire and the ancient Georgian kingdoms. This influence is a testament to the extensive reach of Roman civilization and its interactions with the diverse cultures and peoples at its borders, including those in the Caucasus region where Georgia is located.\nThe Roman Empire's expansion into the Caucasus region began in earnest in the 1st century BC, marking the start of a period of Roman influence that would last for several centuries. The incorporation of parts of what is now Georgia into the Roman Empire brought about significant cultural, political, and economic changes, some of which are reflected in the place names that have survived to this day.\nOne of the most direct impacts of Roman presence in Georgia was the establishment of Roman settlements and military outposts. These often bore Latin names or were named after Roman officials, soldiers, or emperors. Over time, some of these names were adapted into the Georgian language, undergoing linguistic transformations while retaining their Roman roots. However, the specific names of such settlements that have survived into modern Georgian place names are scarce, largely due to the subsequent waves of influence from other cultures and empires that have dominated the region throughout history.\nIn addition to settlements, the Romans also introduced their system of road construction to the region, connecting various parts of the empire and facilitating the movement of troops, goods, and information. The routes and destinations of these roads sometimes influenced the naming of places, with certain locations being named for their position along a Roman road or their function as a stopover point for travelers and merchants.\nThe Roman influence on Georgian place names is also evident in the adoption of Roman architectural and urban planning concepts. The layout of cities, the construction of fortifications, and the establishment of public spaces such as forums and baths often followed Roman models. While the names of these structures and places have often been lost or transformed beyond recognition, their origins in Roman urbanism are a subtle reminder of the empire's impact on the region.\nFurthermore, the Roman period in Georgia was marked by significant cultural exchanges. The introduction of Christianity to Georgia in the early 4th century AD, a religion that had already been adopted by the Roman Empire, is one such example. While not directly related to place names, this religious transformation had profound effects on Georgian society and culture, indirectly influencing the naming of places after Christian saints and figures, a practice that became widespread in the centuries that followed.\nWhile the direct Roman influence on Georgian place names may not be immediately apparent, the legacy of Roman occupation and interaction with the ancient Georgian kingdoms has left indelible marks on the cultural and historical landscape of Georgia. The Roman period contributed to the shaping of Georgia's identity, with its influence permeating various aspects of Georgian society, from urban development and architecture to the eventual adoption of Christianity. The study of place names and their origins offers valuable insights into this complex and multifaceted history, revealing the layers of interaction and exchange that have defined the region over millennia.\n\n\n== Ancient Georgian cities ==\nThe history of Georgia is marked by the rise and fall of numerous cities that played pivotal roles in the cultural, political, and economic life of the region. These ancient Georgian cities, with their rich histories and archaeological remains, offer a window into the past, revealing the complexity and diversity of Georgian civilization over the millennia. This section highlights some of the most significant ancient cities in Georgia, each with its unique contributions to the country's heritage.\n\n\n=== Mtskheta ===\nMtskheta, one of the oldest cities in Georgia, served as the capital of the early Georgian kingdom of Iberia from the 3rd century BC. Located at the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers, Mtskheta's strategic position made it a vital center for trade and cultural exchange. The city is renowned for its historical religious buildings, such as the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral and Jvari Monastery, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Mtskheta's significance in Georgian Christianity cannot be overstated, as it was in this city that Christianity was declared the state religion in the early 4th century AD.\n\n\n=== Kutaisi ===\nKutaisi, the legislative capital and the second-largest city in modern Georgia, boasts a history that stretches back over 3,000 years. It served as the capital of the ancient kingdom of Colchis, a rich and powerful civilization best known in Greek mythology as the destination of Jason and the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece. The city's historical significance is underscored by landmarks such as the Bagrati Cathedral and the Gelati Monastery, which reflect the architectural and cultural achievements of medieval Georgia.\n\n\n=== Uplistsikhe ===\nUplistsikhe, meaning \"the lord's fortress,\" is an ancient rock-hewn town in eastern Georgia, dating back to the early Iron Age. This city carved out of rock is one of the oldest urban settlements in Georgia and served as a major political, religious, and cultural center for centuries. Uplistsikhe's unique blend of pagan and Christian architecture provides insight into the religious transformations that took place in Georgia over the centuries.\n\n\n=== Vani ===\nVani is an ancient city located in western Georgia, which flourished between the 8th and 1st centuries BC. It was a principal city of ancient Colchis, renowned for its sophisticated culture and as a center for the worship of the goddess Aphrodite. Archaeological excavations in Vani have uncovered rich collections of artifacts, including gold and silver jewelry, bronze sculptures, and ceramics, attesting to the city's wealth and its extensive trade networks with the ancient world.\n\n\n=== Tbilisi ===\nTbilisi, the capital of modern Georgia, has its origins in the 5th century AD when it was founded by King Vakhtang Gorgasali. The city's strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes between Europe and Asia facilitated its growth into a thriving urban center. Tbilisi's diverse cultural heritage is reflected in its architecture, which encompasses Eastern Orthodox churches, Persian fortresses, and Soviet Modernist structures. The city's ancient past is still palpable in the historic district of Old Tbilisi, where narrow streets and old buildings tell the story of centuries of Georgian history.\nThese cities, with their ancient fortifications, religious monuments, and archaeological sites, are not merely relics of the past but living testimonies to Georgia's rich and diverse history. They illustrate the country's role as a crossroads of civilizations, where East meets West, and where ancient traditions have been preserved and celebrated through the ages.\n\n\n== Modern names with ancient origins ==\nThe nomenclature of places within modern Georgia is a rich tapestry that weaves together threads from the country's multifaceted history, reflecting influences from various epochs, cultures, and languages.Many contemporary Georgian place names are deeply rooted in ancient origins, carrying forward the legacy of the past into the present. These names serve not only as geographical identifiers but also as cultural and historical signposts, offering insights into the historical events, religious beliefs, and societal changes that have shaped Georgia over the millennia.\n\n\n=== Tbilisi ===\nTbilisi, the vibrant capital of Georgia, offers a prime example of a modern name with ancient origins. Founded in the 5th century AD by King Vakhtang Gorgasali, the city's name derives from the Old Georgian word \"tbili,\" meaning \"warm.\" This etymology references the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs, which have been a central feature of the city since its inception. Over the centuries, Tbilisi has grown from a small settlement into a major cultural and political center, all the while retaining its name that echoes the city's ancient roots.\n\n\n=== Kutaisi ===\nKutaisi, Georgia's legislative capital and one of its oldest cities, traces its name back to ancient times. Historically, it served as the capital of the kingdom of Colchis, a region renowned in Greek mythology as the destination of Jason and the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece. The name \"Kutaisi\" has been linked to various etymological origins, some suggesting a connection to ancient Indo-European languages, reflecting the city's long history and its role as a cultural crossroads.\n\n\n=== Mtskheta ===\nMtskheta, the ancient capital of the Georgian kingdom of Iberia, is another city whose name is steeped in history. As one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Mtskheta's name is thought to derive from the Mtkvari River, on whose banks the city is situated. The city's name has undergone various transformations over the centuries, yet it remains a symbol of Georgia's enduring Christian heritage and its pivotal role in the country's religious history.\n\n\n=== Uplistsikhe ===\nThe name \"Uplistsikhe,\" meaning \"the lord's fortress\" in Georgian, refers to an ancient rock-hewn town that dates back to the early Iron Age. This name encapsulates the site's historical significance as a major political, religious, and cultural center, reflecting its strategic importance and the architectural ingenuity of its inhabitants. Uplistsikhe's name is a testament to the enduring legacy of Georgia's ancient civilizations and their contributions to the country's cultural heritage.\n\n\n=== Batumi ===\nBatumi, a major city and seaport on the Black Sea coast, has a name that also harks back to ancient times. While the exact origins of the name \"Batumi\" are debated, some theories suggest it derives from Greek or other ancient languages, reflecting the city's long history of trade and cultural exchange with the wider Mediterranean world. Today, Batumi is known for its blend of modern architecture and historical sites, embodying the fusion of ancient and contemporary influences that characterizes much of Georgia.\nThese examples illustrate the deep historical roots of modern Georgian place names, each carrying forward the legacy of the past into the present. Through their names, these cities and towns offer a window into Georgia's rich tapestry of history, culture, and tradition, bridging the gap between ancient origins and contemporary identity.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johannes August Winter (17 December 1847 – 7 April 1921) was a German Lutheran missionary for the Berlin Missionary Society (BMS) who played an important role in the formation of the Lutheran Bapedi Church in South Africa at the turn of the 19th century, against a backdrop of competing political and economic power struggles between British, Afrikaner and native tribal interests. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohannes's father, the Reverend August Wilhelm Winter, and mother, Anna Schüttge (also from a missionary family in Lusatia), came from Berlin to Bethany, Free State in 1839 to assist fellow missionary Carl Wuras. In 1847 August established a new BMS mission at Pniel in the Orange Free State, where Johannes and his siblings were born. The family went back to Germany in 1851 due to August's ill health, but the children all returned to South Africa after receiving their education in Germany.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nAfter successfully completing his schooling in Germany, Winter was admitted to the Berlin Missionary Society's seminary on the recommendation of inspector Eduard Kratzenstein. He excelled academically and was admitted to a fully funded degree in theology at the University of Berlin, on the recommendation of the dean of the faculty, Dr. J.A. Dorner.\n\n\n== Early career at Botshabelo ==\nIn 1873 Winter returned to South Africa to commence his career at the  Botshabelo mission station in the district of Middelburg in the then ZAR, originally established in 1865 by another BMS missionary, Alexander Merensky, father of the well-known South African geologist, Hans Merensky. In 1878 he became the head of the national helpers' (Nationalhelferen) seminary at Botshabelo.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn 1876 Winter married Elisabeth Wangemann, daughter of the influential Hermann Theodor Wangemann, who had become director of the BMS in Berlin in 1865.\n\n\n== Thaba Mosego ==\nIn 1880 the Winters were asked to establish a mission station at Thaba Mosego, the vanquished capital of the Pedi king, Sekhukhune, who had been defeated the year before by an army of British, Boer and Swazi soldiers. In 1881 Sekhukhune was released from prison by the British and returned to his old domain, where a strong working relationship developed between him and Winter. Sekhukhune even went so far as to propose a betrothal of Winter's infant daughter, Anna, as a future wife of his. This was initially rejected by Winter, but in time he agreed, on condition that Anna would have the final say once she came of age.\nHowever, in 1882 Sekhukhune was assassinated by his brother, Mampuru, a crime for which Mampuru was captured and hanged in 1883 by the Boer government that had recently taken over from the British. Sekhukhune was succeeded by his brother, Kgoloko, who ruled for the next decade, maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with both Winter and Abel Erasmus, the ZAR's \"native commissioner\" for the area.\n\n\n== Lutheran Bapedi Church ==\nIn the period from around 1865 to 1883, the BMS kept paternalistic control over all aspects of the Pedi converts' lives, while simultaneously neutralizing any possible influence from any Pedi chiefs who wanted to retain the loyalty of their erstwhile subjects. Unhappiness steadily grew amongst the population, so much so that in 1889, Martinus Sewushane, a prominent native evangelist, and around 500 of his followers decided to secede from the BMS to form the Lutheran Bapedi Church (LBC). Winter, who was sympathetic to their cause, was asked to join them – he did, despite strong opposition and condemnation from Wangemann and other BMS leaders in Berlin. Through his relationship with Erasmus, Winter arranged for formal recognition of the new church by the ZAR government. After the Second Boer War, Winter returned to the Bapedi, settling on the farm Onverwacht near Schoonoord in 1904, which he had been given by Transvaal Consolidated Land and Exploration Company (TCL), a massive company owned by the powerful mining company, Corner House, as a reward for discovering asbestos in the area.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n\nWinter retired from the LBC in 1917, spending his last few years with his eldest son, Christian, on the farm Mecklenburg in the Lydenburg area, still regularly conducting church services. He passed away on 7 April 1921 from heart failure.\n\n\n== Published works ==\n\"The Tradition of Ra'lolo\" (1912).\n\"The History of Sekwati\" (1913).\n\"The Phallus Cult Amongst the Bantu; Particularly the Bapedi of Eastern Transvaal\" (1914).\n\"The Mental and Moral Capabilities of the Natives, Especially of Sekukuniland (Eastern Transvaal)\" (1914).\n\n\n== References/Notes and references ==",

        "content": "Tel Eton is an archaeological site measuring 60 dunams, located in the Telam Valley, near Nahal Adoraim in the southeast of the Judean Lowlands, near Moshav Shekef. The tell's current name comes from the nearby village that was inhabited between the Byzantine period to the Arab period, Kharbat Eyton.\nIn a survey conducted on the tell, signs of settlement were discovered from the Early Bronze Age to the Persian and Hellenistic periods, in the 3rd-4th centuries. The survey brought up a few findings from later periods, which probably do not reflect a permanent settlement in the Tel. During the Byzantine period, the tell became agricultural land, and during this period large earthworks were carried out in the site and many terraces were built, which give the mound its current shape.\n\n\n== Research history ==\nThe site is marked on the map of the PEF Survey of Palestine as \"Khirbat Aitun\" (Kh. Aitun). Near the tell appears on the map an innocent-looking inscription about caves and pits in the area. In fact, the area contains many hundreds of burial caves.\nThe Tel and its surroundings remained unexcavated for many decades, until after the Six-Day War, widespread grave robbing began around the site. Following this, the Israel Antiquities Authority, in collaboration with Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, carried out rescue excavations in the necropolis of the tell, in which burial caves were discovered from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period (a period that is not represented in the tell itself).\nIn the summer of 1976, robbery excavations were conducted on the Tel. As a result, the members of the Tel Lachish excavation team came to Tel Eton, and conducted rescue excavations for two weeks, in the center of the Tel. The limited excavation brought up mainly findings from the 8th-9th centuries BCE - Iron Age 2.\nStarting in 2006, a delegation from the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archeology at Bar-Ilan University led by Avraham Faust excavated the site. \n\n\n== The history of the Tel ==\n\nThe information about the Tel in its beginnings is limited, as the excavations have not yet deepened beyond the Late Bronze Age, but the results of the survey show a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age, which declined in the Intermediate Bronze Age, revived in the Middle Bronze Age and grew to become a significant city in the Late Bronze Age. The settlement, which lies on the seam between the Judean and Philistine areas of control, continued its life during the Iron Age as a fortified city. The main finds in the Tel belong to the Iron Age II, when a main city existed on the Tel and was one of the largest in the Kingdom of Judah.\nAt the top of the Tel, a spacious house of the Four-room house (also known as an \"Israelite house\") type was discovered, built of bricks and fieldstones and Ashlar. The house, which is particularly large, covers an area of 250 square meters (and apart from the courtyard, there was probably also a second floor), and contains a rich find, especially an archaeobotanical find: olive seeds, grapes, lentils, grains and cloves of garlic. The beginning of the building is dated according to the organic find to the end of the 11th century or the beginning of the 10th century BCE. The building was destroyed at the end of the 8th century, perhaps during Sennacherib's campaign in 701.\nIn the later period of the settlement on the tell, a large citadel was built in the place where the \"Governor's House\" used to stand, with particularly thick walls. The walls survived only to the height of one course so that the outline of the citadel can be seen, but it cannot be dated. Based on the findings elsewhere on the hill, the excavators speculate that this citadel was built in the Persian period, or at the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\n\n\n== The burial caves ==\n\nThe remains of an ancient cemetery considered one of the largest in the Land of Israel, were uncovered around Tel Iton. The cemetery was used continuously from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age II (8th century BC). About 400 burial caves were uncovered there; The earliest of them date to the Intermediate Bronze Age (16th-15th century BC), while the latest dates to the Iron Age II. The original cemetery was west of the mound, and in the 8th and 7th centuries BC it began to spread to other areas around The mound.\nAccording to a study conducted there, the cemetery at Tel Eton and other sites in the Shephelah had an influence on the development of burial in the Kingdom of Judah. In the Shephelah, an area inhabited by Canaanites who later assimilated among the rest of the inhabitants of Judah, the custom of burial in caves predates the central mountain area, whose inhabitants used to bury their dead in simple shallow graves, while the burial caves were mainly used by members of the upper class. In the 8th century, there was a significant change in the burial method in the kingdom, and the use of burial caves became particularly popular, also among the other strata of the population and you can see burial caves of the type known as the \"Judahite Tomb\". These adopted a new type of burial model in caves, which is somewhat similar to the \"Beit Arba HaMrahavim\", the most common residential model in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel.\nIn light of the findings from Tel Eton, the researchers speculate that this method spread from the Judean Lowlands. With the adoption of the cave burial method throughout Judea, the residents of Tel Eton also made changes and adjustments to the cave burial method in the settlement.\nFirst, the investigation of the Tel Eton cemetery in a rescue excavation conducted in 1968 following reports of antiquities being looted. Later, a number of rescue excavations and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nThe Palestine Exploration Fund identified Tel Eton with the city of Itam, which belonged to the tribe of Shimon, and later this identification was supported by Yohanan Aharoni. Martin Noth identified the tell with the city of \"Aglon\" which is mentioned several times in the Book of Joshua, and is described as being between the cities of Lachish and Hebron. Nut's identification was also accepted by Anson Rainey and is considered the accepted identification of the Tel. Gershon Galil identified Libnah at Tel Eton, an identification denied by Nadav Na'aman, who states that the site was not inhabited in the seventh century, which does not correspond to Hamotal the daughter of Jeremiah, who was the wife of King Josiah of Libnah. Zechariah Kalai hesitantly raised the idea that Tel Eton is Moresheth-Gath.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leslie Bernstein (9 October 1939 – 28 July 2022) was an American cancer epidemiologist and biostatistician. Known particularly for her research on breast cancer, in 1994 Bernstein led a ground-breaking study that found a correlation between moderate exercise and breast cancer risk reduction. Bernstein received many awards for her research, including from the American Association for Cancer Research, and was described as the \"mother of cancer epidemiology\" by City of Hope.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nBernstein was born on 9 October 1939 in Long Beach, California. During her youth, she was a nationally ranked swimmer. She graduated from Hughes Junior High in Long Beach and started her studies at the University of California, Los Angeles at the age of 16, earning an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1959, having initially hoped to become a statistician.\nWhen she was 18, she married Saul Bernstein, a physical education student who had similar aspirations to work in medicine. Recognising they could not afford to pay two sets of tuition fees, Bernstein paused her studies to raise their children while her husband trained as a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon. During the Vietnam War, Bernstein's husband was drafted, and the family relocated to Kansas and subsequently Georgia, where he treated wounded soldiers. They later spent a period of time in the United Kingdom, where Bernstein's husband completed his medical fellowship.\nAfter a 17-year break, Bernstein resumed her studies at the age of 36 at the University of Southern California. She went on to obtain a master's degree in gerontology in 1978 and a PhD in biometry in 1981, at the age of 41.\nBernstein was married until her husband's death in 2010, and they had three children together. Bernstein died on 28 July 2022 at the age of 82.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1981, Bernstein worked as a researcher and professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC for 25 years, before officially retiring in 2007. She went on to serve as the director of the cancer aetiology at the Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment centre.\nDuring her career, Bernstein led several ground-breaking studies. In 1994, she identified that people could reduce their risks of developing breast cancer through moderate exercise, becoming the first researcher to highlight the links between exercise and cancer survival. In 2017, Bernstein participated in a study that found the use of low-dose aspirin could reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women. In addition to her breast cancer research, Bernstein also contributed to research on other forms of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, as well as into the long-term impact of cancer treatments on survivors.\nAlongside Jonine Bernstein, Bernstein worked on the twenty-year Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study, which was the largest study of genetic susceptibility and risk for second primary breast cancer in women already diagnosed with the disease. In 1995, she co-founded the California Teachers Study, a cohort of 133,479 female public school professionals, which studied the impact of health behaviours on disease development through completing regular questionnaires with participants. Bernstein served as the California Teachers Study's Principal Investigator between 2006 and 2016.\nBernstein joined the American Association for Cancer Research in 1996, and served as a council member for its Women in Cancer Research group from 2011 until 2013. She also worked closely with the National Breast Cancer Coalition as a proponent for patient advocacy. Her additional support of the NBCC included joining them in testifying before Congress, and taking part in work to dispel myths around abortion being a cause of breast cancer.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn recognition of her cancer prevention research, Bernstein received the AACR–Prevent Cancer Foundation Award for Excellence in Cancer Prevention Research in 2007, and the AACR–American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention in 2018. She also received recognition the Abraham Lilienfeld Award for Lifetime Contributions to Epidemiology, in addition to awards from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the American Society for Preventative Oncology, and the University of Southern California.\nBernstein also received recognition for her prominence as a woman in science, as well as for her commitment to mentoring female students, researchers, and faculty members throughout her carer. For this, she received City of Hope's Lifetime Achievement Mentoring Award, as well as the Rosalind E. Franklin Award for Women in Science.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Herbert Antcliffe (30 July 1875 – 11 September 1964) was a British musicologist, music critic, teacher and author on musical subjects, who established his career in Sheffield and later moved to The Hague in Holland.\nAntcliffe was born in Sheffield, son of Herbert Antcliffe of Eckington, Derbyshire and his wife Cordelia Staniforth (younger sister of the hymn composer Thomas Worsley Staniforth, whose music Antcliffe later edited). Antcliffe attended Sheffield University in its formative years, where he first encountered the conductor and composer Henry Coward, who remained a friend. From 1895 he established himself as a music critic for the Sheffield Telegraph.  He was also organist at St Matthew's Church, Carver Street, Sheffield Treeton Parish Church and St Wilfrid's Church, Sheffield. As a music tutor in Sheffield he taught piano, organ, singing and music theory from his home at 136 Crookesmoor Road, and later at 102 Cell Street. \nAntcliffe left Sheffield in 1915, joining the staff of the Evening Standard in London. He took up an organists position at St Alban's Church, North Finchley. After World War 1 he moved to The Hague, where he lived at 73, van Merlenstraat to further his long-standing expertise in Dutch music. He was awarded the Queen Wilhelmina Honour for services to Dutch music in 1939.\nAntcliffe was a regular contributor to British, European, American and South African musical journals from the early 1900s until the 1950s. He was also an occasional composer of songs, part songs and church music. His choral setting of Wordsworth's A song for the spinning wheel was published in 1914 by Bayley & Ferguson.\nCaught in Holland by the Nazi invasion, Antcliffe was unable to continue his journalistic activities, and with his Dutch wife Helena Borsboom suffered from near-starvation. They returned to Britain in January 1949. In recognition of his services to British music he was awarded a Civil List Pension. Antcliffe died in 1964, aged 89. A collection of his archives and manuscripts are held at Sheffield University.\nHis books include:\n\nBrahms (G. Bell & Sons, 1905)\nSchubert (G. Bell & Sons, 1910)\nLiving Music (1912)\nThe Successful Music Teacher (1912)\nA Study of Modern Harmony, by René Lenormand, translated Antcliffe (1915)\nThe Amateur Singer (1920)\nHow to Enjoy Music (1921)\nMusiek in Europa na Wagner (1925)\nArt, Religion and Clothes (self-published, 1926)\nThe Chorus Master (Paxton, 1928)\nShort Studies in the Nature of Music (1929)\nBeethoven's own words, complied and annotated by Philip Kruseman, translated Antcliffe (Hinrichsen's miniature surveys, 1947)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stenders Kunstforlag was a leading publisher of postcards and reproductions of artworks based in Vopenhagen, Denmark.\n\n\n== History ==\nCarl Stender (1862–1902) was born into a Danish-speaking family in Schleswig. His father Friedrich Ludwig Stender was the managing director of the local psychiatric hospital. In the middle of the 1880s, Stender moved to Copenhagen. Stenders Kunstforlag was founded by him in 1999. The company was initially based in rented premises in Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder's building at G. C. Andersens Boulevard 10 (then Halmtorvet 10). In around 1890 Stender moved the company to larger premises in Berling's building at Pilestræde9 26. The company had now also moved into the market for reproductions of Nordic artworks. Stender's younger brother Villy (1877–1946) became a partner in 1808. In 1899, Stenders Kunstforlag was converted into a limited company (aktieselskab). In the same year, it relocated to larger premises at Frederiksholms Kanal. Kunstforeningen was also based in the building.\nAfter Carl Stender's death in 1902, Stenders Kunstforlag was continued with his brother-in-law Wilhelm Knudsen (brother of his wife Olga) as managing director. He had for several years worked for the company as a travelling salesman. After his death just four four years later, he was replaced by Villy Stender and  Poul Mik. Meyer. In the same year, Stenders Kunstforlag relocated to new premises in the Ferrum Building at  Rådhuspladsen 35. The building had replaced five older properties in 1904. It was built to designs by Philip Smidth. A subsidiary was shortly thereafter established in Stockholm. It was headed by Martin Bjorkmann.\n\nIn 1911, Rådhuspladsen 35 was acquired by the newspaper Politiken. In 1916, Stænders Kunstforlag bought P. Ipsens Enke. In 1916–17, it constructed a large new building at Bernstorffsgade 23 as a new home for the two companies. The building was designed by Med Albert Oppenheim.\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Stenders Kunstforlag was hit by the economic crisis. When Poul Mik. Meyer died in 1930, he was succeeded by Villy Stender's eldest son Curt as head of the daily operations. He invested heavily in new printing machinery. By 1934 the crisis years were replaced by a period with new growth. Villy Stender died in 1946 and Curt died just 47 years old in 1052. The company was then continued by the latter's widow Gertrud with the two long-employees Kaj Ditlevsen and as managing directors. Curt and Gertrud Stender's son Rolf joined the firm in 1955. In 1960, he took om the position of managing director of the company.\nIn 1963, Stenders Kunstforlag relocated to a new building at Meterbuen 9–13 in Skovlunde. The new building was designed by Jørgen Maahr.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlex. Vincents Kunstforlag\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the first museum of its kind in Portugal, located in the last stronghold of the crypto-Jewish community established there around the 15th century.\nThe museum displays over a hundred religious, everyday, and professional use items used by Jewish families, especially Beira Interior and Trás-os-Montes. The museum attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and is considered one of the best of its kind throughout the Iberian Peninsula. British newspaper The Telegraph included the museum in its list of the 50 best small museums in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was inaugurated on April 17, 2005, by the then Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Augusto Santos Silva.\nIn August 2017 the museum reopened after undergoing a renovation project costing 350,000 USD, also introducing interactive exhibitions. António Dias Rocha, the mayor of Belmonte, stated to the Lusa news agency that the renovated museum is expected to become a significant center for Sephardic culture, aiming to explain the Jewish community's long history in Belmonte and attract 100,000 visitors annually.\nIn 2023 the Jewish Museum was the most frequented museum in Belmonte, attracting both local and international visitors, notably from Israel, Brazil, the US, and Spain.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrypto-Judaism\nNew Christian\nMarrano\nSamuel Schwarz\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe museum's web page including photos, an introductory text, contacts, and address\nNotícia da inauguração",

        "content": "NGC 3395 is a peculiar spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo Minor. The galaxy lies about 55 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3395 is approximately 35,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 7, 1785. NGC 3395 interacts with NGC 3396.\nNGC 3395 forms an interacting pair with NGC 3396, a magellanic spiral galaxy that lies 1.5 arcminutes from the nucleus of NGC 3395. The mass ratio of the two galaxies is about 1.5 to 1. The two galaxies appear separate but a bridge of material is visible between them and tidal tails are observed. Dynamical modelling of the pair suggests that the two galaxies had a first close encounter in the past, which resulting in gas been stripped from NGC 3395 and forming a tidal tail to the south-east. A second close encounter took place about 50 million years ago, resulting to starburst activity. The two galaxies will most likely merge in the next 500 million years.\nThe galaxy hosts a number of HII regions that are star forming with the region of most intense star formation being in the northwest of the center, while star formation has also being in observed in the end of the spiral arm northeast of the nucleus and in three regions in the bridge between the two galaxies. Three more star forming regions are visible in a tail southwest of the galaxy. The average size of the knots in NGC 3395 is an order of magnitude smaller than those in NGC 3396. The nucleus of NGC 3395 doesn't appear to be active.\nThe NGC 3395/3396 pair is part of the NGC 3430 Group or LGG 218. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 3381, NGC 3424, NGC 3430, NGC 3442, and IC 2604. IC 2604 lies 14 arcmin to the south-west of the pair and IC 2608 14 arcmin to the south-east. The group is part of the Leo II groups, which is part of the Virgo Supercluster.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3395 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "The El Tintal Manuel Zapata Olivella Public Library, part of BibloRed, is located in the west of Bogotá, Colombia, on Ciudad de Cali Avenue. It was designed by the architect Daniel Bermúdez. Formerly, it operated as a waste and garbage treatment plant, Protecho, owned by the company EDIS, but it was abandoned. Its construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2002.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe library has an area of 6,650 m2 and a capacity of 150,000 volumes. It has a reading room for young people and adults with a capacity of 500 people, consisting of a reference room, a newspaper and periodical section, rooms for group work, a multimedia room, and a computer room. Additionally, there is a children's room with a capacity for 200 children, including a reading room, workshops, a playroom, and multimedia facilities. Among its facilities, there is also an auditorium for 160 people, three multipurpose rooms, a temporary exhibition hall, and a room with information about Bogotá.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe library is located on City of Cali Avenue, near to the New Castilla area and the Tintal Plaza shopping centre, in the Kennedy District, west of Bogotá. In addition to the City of Cali Avenue, Las Americas Avenue serves as a route to reach the library thanks to the Transmilenio service and other regular ways of public transportation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe waste treatment plant was established in 1989 with an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 years. It was in operation until the liquidation of EDIS (for \"Empresa Distrital de Servicios Públicos\", or District Public Services Company) in 1993.\nIn 1999, G. Sierra Mechanics Engineering was commissioned to carry out the \"Diagnosis of the current state of the waste transfer plant\", detailing the situation of each of the plant's components, the possible causes for its failure to function properly, and the minimum conditions necessary to seek some utilization of the existent parts on site. The document is a precedent for the origin of the Manuel Zapata Olivella El Tintal Public Library, which was built on the site where the plant used to operate.\nThe library opened on June 29th, 2001, making a transition \"from garbage to reading\", in the words of its architect Daniel Bermúdez. In 2006, it was named the Metropolitan Public Library Tintal \"Manuel Zapata Olivella\", according to Agreement 224 of 2006 of the Bogotá Council.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVirgilio Barco Public Library\nTunal Public Library\nBibloRed\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVV.

They are commemorated on May 13.\nGeorgian monks began to settling on Mount Athos from the forties in the 940s. by the 13th century, it had become a stronghold for crusaders.\nCrusaders, often referred to as Papists, launched repeated attacks on the area between 1259 and 1306. In an attempt to undermine Orthodox unity, they decapitated several abbots from monasteries such as Zograf Monastery, Vatopedi, Protaton, among  others. Not even the Monastery of Iviron was spared their wrath.\nThe crusaders demanded that the Iveronian monks accept Catholic faith and recognize the supremacy of the Pope, which the monks refused. As reported by the Athonite Patriarchate, the monks were forcibly removed from Iveron Monastery, placed on a ship, and drowned at sea by the Papists. The younger and healthier monks, predominantly Georgian, were transported to Italy along with monastery property and sold into slavery.\nAccording to various sources, this event took place at Iveron Monastery, with one indicating 1259 and others suggesting a timeframe between 1276 and 1280.\n\n\n== References ==",

In August 2023, the State Administration Council junta expelled the East Timorese ambassador in retaliation for the East Timorese government meeting with the National Unity Government of Myanmar (NUG). In December 2023, East Timor President José Ramos-Horta called for Tatmadaw soldiers to defect and join the resistance, making East Timor the only government to have openly expressed sympathies to anti-junta forces in Myanmar. Officials of the State Administration Council responded with outrage, running anti-East Timor articles in state media referring to Ramos-Horta as a \"thoughtless mouthpiece of the NUG\". Additionally, \"junta-backed nationalists\" held a protest in Yangon against Ramos-Horta.\n\n\n== References ==",

The season was the eighth in charge for head coach, and former player, Matthew Walker. Sam Billings stepped down as club captain, signed a white-ball only contract and retained captaincy of the Twenty20 side. Daniel Bell-Drummond was named as the 36th men's Captain of Kent Cricket. Paul Downton retired as Director of Cricket at the end of the 2023 season, and was replaced by bowling coach Simon Cook. Former Kent bowler Robbie Joseph replaced Cook as bowling coach. Batting coach Alex Gidman left his role to become assistant coach with the England women's team. Gidman was replaced by Toby Radford.\n\n\n== Squad ==\n\n\n=== Departures ===\nMichael Hogan retired from cricket at the end of the 2023 season. Wicket-keeper Jordan Cox signed for Essex. Alex Blake, who made his debut for Kent in 2008, and James Logan were both released by the county after the 2023 season.\n\n\n=== Arrivals ===\nIn June 2023, Kent announced that England leg-spinner Matt Parkinson would join from Lancashire at the end of the season. In 2023, Parkinson played on loan for Kent in the One Day Cup. In October 2023, Kent announced the signing of bowler George Garrett. The following month, Kent signed bowler Michael Cohen, a South African who qualifies as a non-overseas player through residency.\nKent re-signed Australian fast bowler Wes Agar for the first four months of the season, having represented the county in 2023. Kent also signed a second Australian fast bowler for the first half of the season, Xavier Bartlett, who had played alongside Sam Billings for Brisbane Heat during Big Bash 13. However, Cricket Australia withdrew permission for Bartlett's Championship stint the day before the start of the season. Kent signed South African all-rounder Beyers Swanepoel from 1 May.\n\n\n=== Squad list ===\nAges given as of the first day of the County Championship, 5 April 2024.\n\n\n== County Championship ==\n\n\n=== Division One ===\n\n\n== One-Day Cup ==\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n== T20 Blast ==\n\n\n=== South Group ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKent home at ESPN cricinfo\nKent County Cricket Club official site",

        "content": "The 2024 City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council election will take place on 2 May 2024. One third of councillors (30 out of 90) are to be elected. The election will take place alongside other local elections across the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Bradford was a district of the West Yorkshire metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The West Yorkshire Combined Authority was established in 2014 and began electing the mayor of West Yorkshire in 2021.\nSince its formation, Bradford has been variously under Labour control, Conservative control and no overall control. Councillors have predominantly been elected from the Labour Party, Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Green Party gained their first councillors on Bradford Council in 2002 and following these elections became the joint third largest group on the council.\nLabour had regained control of the council from no overall control in the 2014 council election, gaining one seat to hold 46 out of 90 seats on the council. The Labour Party maintained its majority on the council in subsequent elections. Of the 30 seats contested in the previous election in 2023, Labour won 22 on 47.0% of the vote, the Conservatives won four seats on 24.0% of the vote, the Green Party won three seats on 14.5% of the vote, and the Liberal Democrats won one seat each on 8.5% of the vote.\nPositions up for election in 2024 were last elected in 2021. In that election, fifteen Labour councillors, eleven Conservative councillors, three Liberal Democrat councillors, two Green councillors, and two independent councillors were elected.\n\n\n== Electoral process ==\nThe council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. The election will take place by first-past-the-post voting, with wards generally being represented by three councillors, with one elected in each election year to serve a four-year term.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Bradford aged 18 or over will be entitled to vote in the election. People who live at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, are entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters will be able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nJune 2023: Mohammed Nazam is suspended from the Conservative Party after apologising for attending a Pride event and calling it a \"lapse in judgement\" that \"contradicts [his] personal religious beliefs.\"\nOctober 2023: Sarfraz Nazir and Taj Salam resign from the Labour Party over Keir Starmer's comments on the Israel–Hamas war and join the Bradford Independent Group.\nMarch 13, 2024: Julie Lintern is suspended from the Labour Party after voting against the administration's budget.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bahmani–Vijayanagar War of 1443 marked as the last war between the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan India and the Vijayanagara empire of South India. It commenced between the Bahmanis under Alauddin Ahmad Shah and the Vijayanagar under Deva Raya II, taking place in present-day Mudgal, Karnataka. During the course of two months, three battles unfolded, with the Vijayanagara forces initially securing victory, followed by two subsequent wins by the Bahmanis. These defeats compelled the Vijayanagara ruler to seek peace, agreeing to pay tribute to the Bahmanis.\nFollowing the Siege of Vijayanagara by Bahmani ruler Ahmad Shah I Wali in 1423, there were no military conflicts between the Bahmanis and the Vijayanagara empire until the ascension of his son, Alauddin Ahmad Shah. Upon assuming power, Alauddin dispatched his brother, Muhammad Khan, to demand tribute from the Vijayanagara ruler, Deva Raya II, which had been withheld. Muhammad Khan successfully defeated the Vijayanagara forces, compelling Deva Raya to pay tribute. This event prompted Deva Raya to incorporate Muslim forces into his army to enhance its training. Returning from the campaign, Muhammad Khan received counsel from certain officers suggesting that he possessed equal rights to the Bahmani Sultanate as his brother Alauddin, as promised by their father, Ahmad Shah. Seeking support from various chiefs, including the Vijayanagara emperor, Muhammad Khan captured several locations, prompting Alauddin to mobilize against him. Despite his defeat, Muhammad Khan was pardoned by Alauddin and granted the jagir of Rajachal.\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt orchestrated by his brother in Vijayanagara, Deva Raya II retaliated by executing all his opponents. Seizing this moment of vulnerability, Bahmani Sultan Alauddin saw an opportunity to invade Vijayanagara and exact tribute, which Deva Raya II had promised but failed to pay. In response, Vijayanagara troops launched attacks on Bahmani territories, plundering their positions. Alauddin mobilized his forces against Deva Raya, deploying his general Malik Tujjar against Deva Raya's sons. The Bahmanis successfully recaptured territories, compelling Vijayanagara troops to retreat from the occupied regions. The decisive battles took place at Mudgal, where Bahmani forces initially faced setbacks but ultimately emerged victorious. Deva Raya agreed to pay tribute under the condition that Alauddin would not cross the Tungabhadra River again. This conflict marked the final war between the Bahmanis and Vijayanagara.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFollowing the severe blow dealt by the Bahmanis during the Siege of Vijayanagara in 1423, Vira Vijaya passed away, and was succeeded by his brother Deva Raya II. The ascension of Devaraya II heralded the peak of prosperity for Vijayanagara under the first dynasty. The repeated defeats suffered at the hands of the Bahmanis prompted Deva Raya II to overhaul his military strategy. He received counsel suggesting that the success of the Bahmanis stemmed from the superiority of their cavalry and their expertise in archery. Consequently, he enlisted Muslims into his service, granted them jagirs (land grants), and even constructed a mosque at Vijayanagar for their worship.\nAfter his victory against Vijayanagara in 1423, Ahmad Shah I Wali proceeded to subjugate the Velama chiefs of Telangana, who had aided Vijayanagara in their war against the Bahmanis. He defeated and killed Anapota II, capturing the entire Telangana region in the process. Following this campaign, Ahmad Shah I focused more on the northern part of his realm. Throughout the remainder of his reign, he engaged in wars with the rulers of Mahur, Malwa, Konkan, and Gujarat, ensuring Vijayanagara's immunity from northern attacks for about a decade.\nHowever, the heirs of the late Velama king managed to reclaim various districts of Telangana. But their success was short-lived, as Ahmad Shah I returned to Telangana around 1433 and reduced them to vassalage. Similar to Ahmad Shah I, Deva Raya also sought to avenge the support of kingdoms that had allied with his enemies in the past. Deva Raya could not overlook the alliance between Pedakomati Vema of Kondavidu and Firuz Shah Bahmani. Capitalizing on the weakness of Vema's incompetent successors, Deva Raya conquered the kingdom and incorporated it into his empire. An epigraph at Kondavidu, dated 1432, documents his grant to a Brahman from the region. Ahmad Shah passed away in 1436, and he was succeeded by his son Alauddin II on July 14th, 1436, who assumed the title of Ahmad upon his accession. He renewed war with Vijayanagara upon his succession due to the Vijayanagara king's failure to pay tribute. \n\n\n=== Deva Raya II's attitude towards Muslim soldiers ===\n\nIn the years leading up to 1440, Vijayanagara launched offensive attacks against the Bahmani kingdom but suffered defeat. Upon investigating the causes of this defeat, it was concluded that the superiority of the Muslim forces lay in their Turkish mounted archers. In response, Devaraya took immediate steps to address this weakness by recruiting a special force of 2000 Muslim archers. He housed them in a designated quarter of the city where they had a mosque and a separate slaughterhouse. Devaraya showed them respect by placing a copy of the Quran in front of his throne, so that obeisance made before the monarch was offered to the Quran. He widely recruited Muslims and utilized them both within the ranks and as trainers for his Hindu troops.\nThis force was not the first Muslim contingent to serve in the Vijayanagara armies. Historical records suggest that during the battle at Trichinopoly, the last Hoysala ruler commanded a contingent of 20,000 Muslims. Additionally, inscriptions indicate that Devaraya I, a predecessor of Devaraya II, also employed a force of Muslim cavalry. Devaraya II utilized these Muslim troops to train other archers in cavalry tactics. As a result, within the next few years, he had amassed a body of 60,000 archers ready to take the field. Altogether, Deva Raya's army comprised 10,000 mounted foreign archers, 60,000 Hindu horsemen proficient in archery, and 300,000 adequately trained infantry soldiers.\n\n\n=== Record of Nicolo Conti about Bahmanis ===\nThe fifteenth-century Italian traveler Nicolo Conti provides a description of Indian life during the rule of Alauddin Ahmad Shah, the Bahmani ruler at the time. He observed Indian ships, noting their distinctiveness, especially those anchored in the ports of the Deccan. Conti remarked that these ships were notably larger than those constructed in the shipyards of Italy, each equipped with five sails and as many masts. The lower part of these vessels was constructed with triple planks to withstand the force of the storms prevalent in monsoon climates. Conti mentioned that some of these ships were designed in a way that if one part were damaged by the tempest, the remaining portion could safely complete the voyage to port.\nRegarding the arts of war, Conti mentions that the army utilized javelins, swords, arm-pieces, round shields, bows, and arrows. In particular, he notes that the inhabitants of Central India also employed ballistae, bombarding machines, and siege pieces. Conti finds it peculiar that pestilence was unknown among the people, and they were not susceptible to the diseases that afflicted populations in his own country.\n\n\n=== Record of Abd al-Razzaq about Vijayanagara ===\nShortly after the war, Abd-ur-Razzaq, the ambassador of Shah Rukh from Samarqand, who had spent some time in Calicut, visited Vijayanagara and stayed in the capital for a few months. According to his account, by 1442, the fortifications, temples, palaces, and public buildings of Vijayanagara had been completed. The city occupied an area of approximately sixty-four square miles, with seven enclosures, the accepted number of circuits for a first-class city. The three outermost enclosures consisted of fields designated for cultivation, along with the huts of those working on the land. The four inner enclosures were occupied by houses, with the innermost enclosure containing the palace and its precincts. Several channels had been directed into the city from the Tungabhadra River; one of them is still known as the Räya channel. These channels served the dual purpose of cultivation and supplying water to the city. Despite the potential for exaggeration in Abd-ur-Razzaq's account, Vijayanagara under Devaraya II must have been a splendid city, boasting exceptional fortifications.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nIn 1435, immediately following the accession of Alauddin II, he launched a war against Vijayanagara. The King of Vijayanagara had withheld payment of tribute to the Bahmanis, which had been in arrears for five years. Consequently, Alauddin sent his brother Muhammad Khan and his Amirul Umara Imadul Mulk to demand tribute by force. Additionally, another reason for the conflict was that Deva Raya II, the king of Vijayanagara, had wrongfully seized Anegundi, a Bahmani fort.\nAs the Bahmani army advanced, they ravaged the Vijayanagara countryside and caused significant devastation. With no other option left, Deva Raya was compelled to sue for peace. Consequently, the Sultan granted peace terms, which included the exchange of twenty elephants, a substantial sum of money, and two hundred females skilled in music and dancing. Additionally, valuable presents were given to Prince Muhammad Khan as part of the peace agreement.\n\n\n=== Rebellion of Muhammad Khan ===\nWhile returning home from Vijayanagara, Muhammad Khan halted for a few days at Mudgal. During his stay, he was approached by individuals who were hostile to the interests of his own dynasty. Discontented officers from his own army informed him that it was his late father's wish for him to rule the country jointly with his brother. They claimed that his brother had marginalized him to a subordinate role. They suggested that it was only appropriate for him to demand a partition of the kingdom and receive his rightful share. Muhammad Khan was swayed by these proposals and, influenced by them, he executed Imadul-Mulk and sought assistance from Deva Raya of Vijayanagara. Deva Raya, likely the instigator of the conspiracy himself, readily provided Muhammad Khan with the assistance he sought. In doing so, he attempted to achieve through deceit what he had failed to achieve on the battlefield. The prince promptly seized several forts, including Mudgal, Raichur, Sholapur, and Naldrug, and even crowned himself at a location along the banks of the Krishna River. Alauddin had to personally move to the south to confront his brother. Despite Muhammad's defeat, he was pardoned and granted the jagir of Rajachal.\nDeva Raya of Vijayanagara was reeling from the defeat inflicted upon him by Prince Muhammad and had also been unsuccessful in his attempts to manipulate the prince against his brother. Around 1442, he started to contemplate that perhaps his weakness on the battlefield had contributed to these setbacks, prompting him to embark on reforms for his fighting forces. The nature and implementation of these reforms are an intriguing episode. These were the events that prompted him to recruit Muslim soldiers in his army. \n\n\"About this time Dew Ray (Deva Raya) of Beejanuggar (Vijayanagar) summoned a council of his nobility and principle brahmins; observing to them that as his country (the Carnatic), in extent, population and revenue, far exceeded that of the house of Bahmuny (Bahmani), and also as his army was more numerous, he requested them to point out the cause of the successes of the Mahomedans (Muslims) and of his being reduced to pay them tribute. Some said that the Almighty had decreed to them a superiority over the Hindoos (Hindus) for thirty thousand years, a circumstance which was foretold to them in their own writings Others said that the superiority of the Muslims arose out of two circumstances: first, that their horses were stronger; ... .secondly, that a great body of excellent archers were always maintained by the kings of the house of Bahmuny Dew Ray, upon this, gave orders to enlist Mussulmans (Muslims) in his service, allotting them estates, and erecting a mosque for their use in the city of Beejanuggur . He also commended that no one should molest them in the exercise of their religion, and moreover, he ordered a Quran to be placed before his throne on a rich desk, so that the faithful might perform the ceremony of obeisance in his presence without sinning against their laws. He also made all the Hindoo soldiers learn the art of archery He could soon muster two thousand Mahomedans and sixty thousand Hindoos well skilled in archery, besides eighty thousand cavalry and two hundred thousand infantry, armed in the usual manner with pikes and lances.\"\n\n\n=== Assassination attempt on Deva Raya ===\nSometime after the aforementioned events, a significant incident occurred in Vijayanagara. A brother of the king, driven by jealousy and perhaps harboring ambitions for the kingship, devised a plot to assassinate him. Under the guise of hosting guests for the inauguration of his new house, he invited key state officials who were loyal to the king. As each guest arrived, they were discreetly dispatched by specially appointed assassins. Subsequently, the brother hurried to the palace and confronted the king, unleashing multiple violent blows upon him with a dagger. Believing Deva Raya to be dead, the assailant then proceeded to the palace portico and declared himself as the new king before the gathered crowd. The king, though severely wounded, was not dead and soon arrived at the scene. Upon presenting himself to his people, they apprehended the assassin and executed him. Following this, Deva Raya exacted vengeance on all those who had supported the murderer in this treacherous conspiracy. He ordered their capture and subjected them, along with their families, to gruesome tortures before putting them to death.\nViewing the situation as an opportunity, Alauddin decided to invade Vijayanagara as the promised seven lakhs of Tankas (Vijayanagara currency) were not paid by Deva Raya. Deva Raya's refusal to pay the tribute led to the renewal of war between the two parties.\n\n\n== The War ==\n\nDeva Raya resolved to personally take the field and aimed to reclaim the Raichur Doab, which had been lost in the previous war. He dispatched his two sons, with one heading to Raichur and the other to Bankapur, while he himself crossed the Tungabhadra River and seized Mudgal. Subsequently, he established his camp near the banks of the Krishna River and dispatched troops to raid Bahmani territories. The Vijayanagara troops conducted successful plundering raids, employing fire and sword to devastate everything in their path as far as Sagar and Bijapur.\nThe Bahmani Sultan grew increasingly concerned and personally led his forces southward. Alauddin dispatched Khalaf Hasan Maliku't-Tujjar with the army of Daulatabad against the son of Deva Raya. The Bahmani forces consisted of 50,000 horsemen, and 60,000 Infantry. Additionally, he sent Khan-i Zaman Sarlashkar of Bijapur and Khan-i Zaman Sarlashkar of Berar against Deva Raya himself. Khalaf Khan successfully lifted the siege of Raichur against the son of Deva Raya II, during which the latter sustained injuries. Subsequently, the wounded Vijayanagara prince retreated from the battlefield.\nWith the Bahmani forces advancing, Deva Raya II withdrew to Mudgal, where his troops were stationed. Simultaneously, the second son of Deva Raya faced defeat at Bankapur and was forced to retreat as well. The two primary forces, led by Deva Raya II and Alauddin, clashed at Mudgal, engaging in a fierce battle. Initially, the Vijayanagara forces gained the upper hand, delivering a severe blow to the Bahmani forces. However, as the battle dragged on for two months, the Bahmani forces ultimately emerged victorious. The eldest son of Deva Raya, who had been wounded, was killed in the battle. Deva Raya managed to capture two officers of Alauddin, namely Fakhrul Mulk Dehlavi and his brother, before retreating to the safety of the Mudgal fort. Upon learning of this, Alauddin sent a message to Deva Raya warning that if the two high-ranking officers were harmed, he would not hesitate to exact retribution by killing two lakh of his men when the time came. Faced with this dire threat, Deva Raya had no choice but to seek peace.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDeva Raya responded to Alauddin by expressing his willingness to settle all outstanding tribute payments and cease hostilities if the Sultan agreed not to cross the frontier in the future. Alauddin accepted these terms, and a treaty was promptly signed. Fakhru’l-Mulk, along with his brother, was returned to the Sultan's camp, and all overdue tribute payments were duly settled. The Raya promptly released the prisoners and pledged to annually pay the Sultan the agreed-upon tribute. \nThis marked the final conflict between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani kings, concluding the historical record of their interactions and relations with their southern neighbor. Abd-ur-Razzaq visited Vijayanagara shortly after this war, where he embellished the city's grandeur, praising its splendid architecture and formidable fortifications. Deva Raya lived for six more years following these events, during which the only source of concern was the northern frontier, particularly due to the activities of the monarch of Orissa, the Gajapatis. Therefore, upon Devaraya II's demise, the kingdom remained in a highly satisfactory state and smoothly passed on to his eldest surviving son, Mallikarjuna, without any disputes. Devaraya II had lost one or two of his adult sons during the wars against the Bahmanis throughout his reign. Additionally, it is believed that during the massacre that culminated in the attempt on his life, one of his grown-up sons was also killed. Consequently, it is likely that Mallikarjuna ascended to the throne at a relatively young age.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAllan, John (1964). The Cambridge Shorter History of India. S.

        "content": "Sharaf al-Ma'ali Sama' al-Mulk al-Husayn ibn al-Afdal was a son of the Fatimid vizier and quasi-sultan, al-Afdal Shahanshah. \nHusayn commanded the Fatimid army in the Second (1102) and Third (1105) Battles of Ramla against the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, although some confusion exists since different titles are given by the chronicles for each: Sharaf al-Ma'ali for 1102, and Sama' al-Mulk for 1105, leading to the mistaken assumption by some medieval and modern historians that different sons of al-Afdal were involved in each. In 1115, the increasingly ill and feeble al-Afdal appointed him as his deputy and heir-presumptive. However, after a failed assassination attempt in 1118, al-Afdal suspected his sons of being responsible for it, and withdrew all privileges, income, and personnel assigned to his sons, thus ending the prospect of a dynastic succession. After al-Afdal's assassination in December 1121, his adult sons were confined in the caliphal palace to prevent them from rallying their followers and seize power; instead, Caliph al-Amir, with the assistance of al-Afdal's chief of staff, and now successor as vizier, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, took control of the government. Husayn's fate after that is unknown, but he was likely killed, along with most of his brothers, by the new vizier.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBrett, Michael (2017). The Fatimid Empire.

Dedicated to Bahuchara Mata, a goddess of fertility, the temple is an important pilgrimage site, especially revered by the hijra community and those seeking blessings for fertility and protection.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe temple's origins trace back to the legend of Bahuchara Mata, born into a Charan family. The deity is associated with chastity and fertility, embodying the virtues of purity and courage. The temple has evolved as a central figure in the worship of Bahuchara Mata, drawing pilgrims seeking divine intervention for various personal desires, particularly from the hijra community, whom the goddess is said to protect.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Bahuchar Mata Temple exhibits the intricate craftsmanship of traditional Hindu temple architecture. It consists of three main shrines: the original site (Adyasthan), the middle temple (Madhyasthan), and the main temple that houses the deity. The temple complex is adorned with elaborate carvings, depicting various legends associated with the goddess.\n\n\n== Pilgrimage and worship ==\nThe temple is the epicenter of worship for Bahuchara Mata. Pilgrims visit throughout the year, with a significant increase during the festival of Navratri. The temple practices are inclusive, embracing devotees from all walks of life, including the marginalized hijra community, who find a sanctuary and spiritual solace here.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe most significant festival celebrated at the Bahuchar Mata Temple is Navaratri, a nine-night festival celebrating the divine feminine. This festival attracts thousands of pilgrims, featuring rituals, dances, and offerings to the goddess.\n\n\n== Social and cultural impact ==\nThe Bahuchar Mata Temple is more than a religious site; it's a cultural landmark that supports the social inclusion of the hijra community. By honoring Bahuchara Mata, the temple fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance for hijras, who are often marginalized in society.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Hindu temples in India\nShakti Peethas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site",

        "content": "Palazzo Ravera is a historic Art Nouveau building located in Ivrea, Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned by Stefano Ravera, an entrepreneur from a well-known family of builders from the local Canavese area. This came after his frequent visits to Switzerland, where he was impressed by the grand nineteenth-century buildings of Geneva and Zürich. He entrusted the project to Ivrea engineer Romolo Peona; this also held the position of City Councillor for Public Works.\nThe name of the building is also inseparably linked to that of the hotel that operated in its rooms until its closing in 1989, the Hotel Dora. The hotel was frequented by the high society of Ivrea and the Olivetti managerial class. In 1957, painter Ottone Rosai was found dead from natural causes in a room on the first floor of the hotel.\nToday, the building houses a bank, offices, and commercial activities.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe building is located on Corso Costantino Nigra, opposite Villa Luisa.\nThe main feature of the building, which features an Art Nouveau style, is represented by the northern facade, which is cylindrical and overhangs the underlying Dora Baltea river, just downstream from the Ponte Nuovo.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palazzo Ravera at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Histiophryninae, the star-fingered frogfishes, is a subfamily of marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the family Antennariidae, the frogfishes. The species in this family are found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nHistiophryninae was first proposed as a subfamily by Theodore a Wells Pietsch III and Rachel J. Arnold in 2012. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise this subfamily within the Antennariidae. Other authorities classify this grouping as a full family, the Histiophrynidae. The monospecific genus Tathicarpus is the most derived member of this grouping and represents a separate lineage from all other frogfishes, leading to some consideration of it being placed in its own family, the Tathicarpidae. The Antennariidae is classified within the suborder Antennarioidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes. As part of the family Antennariidae, this taxon is regarded, with the sister taxon to the Antennariidae, the Tetrabrachiidae as the most derived clade within the suborder Antennarioidei.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nHistiophryninae, has its name derived from Histiophryne, its type genus. this combines histio, meaaning \"sail\", an allusion the author of the name, Theodore Gill, did not explain but it may refer to the long soft-rayed dorsal fin which is connected to the caudal fin. The secon part is phryne, which means \"toad\", a suffix commonly used in the names of anglerfish genera, dating back to Aristotle and Cicero, who called anglerfishes \"fishing frogs\" or sea frogs\".\n\n\n== Genera ==\nHistiophryninae contains the following genera:\n\nAllenichthys  Pietsch, 1984\nEchinophryne  McCulloch & Waite, 1918\nHistiophryne  Gill, 1863\nKuiterichthys  Pietsch, 1984\nLophiocharon  Whitley, 1933\nPhyllophryne  Pietsch, 1984\nPorophryne  Arnold, Harcourt & Pietsch, 2014\nRhycherus  Ogilby, 1907\nTathicarpus  Ogilby, 1907\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nHistiophryinae are distinguished from the Antennarinae by the loss of the mesopterygoid and epural. However, the major difference is in the ovaries and the reproductive strategies shown by these fishes. The Histiophryinae have simple oval shaped ovaries while those of Antennariinae have ovaries which are shaped like a double scroll. Histiophryins do not undergo metamorphosis and the eggs and young are given some amount of parental care whereas Anntenariids are broadcast spawners. Generally, Histiophryin frogfishes are small fishes, the largest species is Glauert's anglerfish (Allenchthys glauerti) with a maximum published total length of 11 cm (4.3 in) while the smallest species is Hutchins' anglerfish (Lophiocharon hutchinsi) with a maximum published standard length of 4.9 cm (1.9 in).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nHistiophryinae frogfishes are endemic to the seas around Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Killing baby Hitler is a thought experiment in ethics and theoretical physics which poses the question of using time travel to assassinate an infant Adolf Hitler. It presents an ethical dilemma in both the action and its consequences, as well as a temporal paradox in the logical consistency of time. Killing baby Hitler first became a literary trope of science fiction during World War II and has since been used to explore these ethical and metaphysical debates.\nEthical debates on the problem of killing baby Hitler can demonstrate the outlook of various moral philosophies: utilitarianism holds that killing baby Hitler is justified, as the potential benefits outweigh the potential costs; deontology holds that killing baby Hitler is unjustified, as infanticide is always wrong; and consequentialism may question what the consequences of killing baby Hitler might be, holding that the unforeseen future consequences of such an act make it difficult to judge its morality. It is also used to raise the question of nature versus nurture, whether changing the society that baby Hitler grew up in might be preferable to killing baby Hitler.\nMetaphysical debates about the possibility of killing baby Hitler have been used to discuss different philosophies of time: the B-theory of time considers killing baby Hitler to be impossible due to its inherent temporal paradox, while theories of multiple time dimensions leave room for the past to be changed by killing baby Hitler.\nPublic debate around the question of killing baby Hitler reached its height in late 2015, after The New York Times published a poll asking its readers the question. Advocates of killing baby Hitler included Florida governor Jeb Bush and film actor Tom Hanks, while comedian Stephen Colbert and pundit Ben Shapiro were counted among the opponents of the policy.\n\n\n== Ethical thought experiment ==\n\n\n=== Consequentialist argument ===\nAccording to consequentialism, the morality of any given action is judged solely by its consequences. Consequentialist ethics raises the dichotomy of immediate foreseeable consequences versus unforeseeable potential consequences; for example, in the story of Johann Kühberger saving a young Hitler from drowning, the immediate positive consequences of saving a person's life was the motivating factor, but it also resulted in the eventual negative consequences of Hitler's rise to power. In a 2000 essay on consequentialism, British philosopher James Lenman posited a German bandit in 100 BCE sparing the life of one of Hitler's distant ancestors. According to consequentialism, although the bandit sparing her life led to the unforeseeable future crimes of Hitler, he was not wrong to do so, as killing her could have led to even worse unforeseeable consequences. Killing baby Hitler also raises the possibility of unforeseen consequences, including the commonly-cited possibility that someone even worse than Hitler could rise to power in his place. As the consequences of killing baby Hitler are not known, the problem lacks a clear solution.\n\n\n=== Deontological argument ===\nAccording to deontology, the morality of an action is determined by certain ethical values, rather than by circumstances. Even in the case that it would benefit the common good, deontology opposes killing out of the belief that all human beings have an \"inalienable value\". Deontological ethics thus argues against killing baby Hitler, as it considers killing babies to always be wrong, irrespective of any potential consequences.\n\n\n=== Utilitarian argument ===\nUtilitarianism is a moral philosophy that argues for the maximisation of happiness and the minimisation of suffering. According to utilitarian ethics, killing baby Hitler is justified, as it considers the potential benefits to be greater than the moral cost. As Hitler was responsible for the suffering of millions of people, utilitarianism posits that killing one baby Hitler is justifiable in order to save millions of innocent lives. In this way, the question of killing baby Hitler resembles the trolley problem, which utilitarianism responds to similarly. Arguments against the utilitarian response conclude that focusing on killing baby Hitler, without any guarantee of preventing future suffering, means that the only guaranteed outcome is that the time traveller would have committed the moral evil of infanticide. American philosopher Janet Stemwedel therefore considers killing baby Hitler to be an unreliable means for maximising happiness. Stemwedel posits that applying utilitarian ethics to time travel favours causation over human agency, disregarding the capacity for humans to choose different paths and change.\n\n\n=== Nature versus nurture ===\nTo Canadian psychologist Julia Shaw, the answer one gives to the baby Hitler question is telling of their view on nature versus nurture: people who would kill baby Hitler may have a deterministic view of individual predisposition towards evil, while people that would not kill baby Hitler may place higher value on environmental factors of upbringing and social conditions. In a psychoanalysis of Hitler's infancy, Austrian psychiatrist Frederick Redlich found that he was \"a fairly normal child\" and showed few signs of the genocidal intent or dictatorial tendencies that would characterise his adulthood. As there is no scientific explanation for Hitler's later actions based on his genetics, greater attention is often paid to Hitler's early childhood environment. In a refutation of the great man theory, it can be argued that killing baby Hitler would not eliminate this cultural environment, which would still result in other people growing up to pursue far-right politics and genocidal policies. From this perspective, Janet Stemwedel argues that using time travel to change social conditions would be preferable to infanticide, as it would recognise that the responsibility for Hitler's actions lie not just with him, but also in the collective responsibility of those that raised, followed and elected him.\n\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThe moral justification for killing baby Hitler usually rests on the question of whether a child can be held responsible for their future actions, before they had yet committed any crimes against humanity. A follow-up question can then be posed regarding where the line ends for killing babies that would commit crimes against humanity. The question of where the line ends was brought up by American activist Shaun King, who argued that the logic for killing baby Hitler could just as easily be applied to a newborn Christopher Columbus, infant slave-owners or a young Dylann Roof. Australian moral philosopher Matthew Beard likewise brought up the idea of a baby Pol Pot and Joseph Stalin, arguing that a clear set of ethical principles would be needed to determine which historical babies deserve to be killed.\n\n\n== In theoretical physics ==\nThe question of killing baby Hitler contains a version of the grandfather paradox, also known as the \"Hitler's Murder Paradox\". According to the B-theory of time, if someone travelled back in time with the intention of killing baby Hitler, then their reason for travelling back in time would be eliminated. It is often concluded that as the past has already happened, alteration of the past is a logical impossibility. As Hitler killed himself in 1945, it can also be inferred that no time traveler has killed baby Hitler.\nIn contrast to the B-theory, models that adopt the A-theory of time avoid logical contradictions in the killing of baby Hitler by considering time to be two-dimensional, where the first dimension is standard time (tx) and the second dimension is known as hyper-time (Htx). Theories that leave room for the past to be changed include hyper-eternalism, two-dimensional presentism and hyper-presentism, which each demonstrate the possibility of killing baby Hitler in two-dimensional time. In these temporal models, both the past and the future are held to be mutable; in changing the past by killing baby Hitler, the time traveller also changes the future. Although it can also be debated whether such temporal models genuinely change the past, or if killing baby Hitler simply affects the past by causing a variation in hyper-time.\nIf time travel caused creation of a parallel universe, killing baby Hitler would only create a parallel universe without Hitler in it, and the original universe would continue existing and thus the suffering he caused in that timeline would not be alleviated by the time-traveling assassin. From this perspective, astrophysicist Brian Koberlein concluded that killing baby Hitler would be \"inconsequential at best, and could be downright harmful\", recommending that time travelers avoid such an activity and instead visit the 1980s.\n\n\n== Literary trope ==\nKilling baby Hitler is a common literary trope of contemporary science fiction, usually depicting a time traveler going back to the 1890s to assassinate an infant Hitler before he can start World War II and perpetrate the Holocaust. Stories of this kind date as far back as World War II itself, with publications in Weird Tales (1941) and Astounding Science Fiction (1942) including the trope.\nStories in the sub-genre detail a variety of different consequences for killing baby Hitler. In his 1995 short story \"Dieu porte-t-il des lunettes noires?\", Maurice G. Dantec presents an ethical dilemma in travelling through time to kill baby Hitler. In his 1996 novel Making History, Stephen Fry depicts a history student travelling back in time and rendering Alois Hitler infertile. But in the place of Adolf Hitler, a different and more effective Nazi dictator takes power, defeats the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons, conquers Europe and exterminates the Jewish people. In Selden Edwards' 2008 novel The Little Book, the protagonists find themselves back in 1890s Vienna and decide to assassinate a young Hitler, but find themselves unable to kill an \"innocent boy\", despite knowing what he would grow up to become.  In a 2015 short story, American humourist Alexandra Petri depicted Hitler being abducted and raised well by a kindly time traveler. In a post-credits scene of the 2018 film Deadpool 2, the titular character goes back in time to kill baby Hitler, but the outcome is not shown. In the extended cut, the film shows Deadpool realising he can not do it and changing baby Hitler's diaper.\nIn order to avoid the \"Hitler-murder paradox\", some science fiction stories follow the Novikov self-consistency principle, which holds that if time travel is possible, then changing the past cannot meaningfully alter the future. In the 1977 novella The Primal Solution, an elderly Holocaust survivor travels through time and attempts to kill a young Hitler, but he survives and is set down the path of antisemitism by the experience. In a 2002 episode of The Twilight Zone, \"Cradle of Darkness\", a woman travels through time and kills baby Hitler, but another baby is adopted by Hitler's mother and grows up to do all the same things as Hitler. An earlier episode of The Twilight Zone, \"No Time Like the Past\" (1963), depicts a time traveler failing to assassinate Hitler, in keeping with the self-consistency principle. In Juliusz Machulski's 2013 film AmbaSSada, the protagonists get transported back in time and meet Hitler due to a coincidence, only spontaneously deciding to kill him. As they had not travelled in time with the intention of killing Hitler, the \"Hitler's Murder Paradox\" is avoided and history is consequently altered.\n\n\n== Public debate ==\nIn conversations about time travel, it is common to raise the subject of changing the past and specifically the question of killing baby Hitler, in what is also known as \"Godwin's law of time travel\". Public debate on the baby Hitler question was brought to prominence in October 2015, when a poll by The New York Times asked its readers if they would kill baby Hitler. The poll received a plurality of affirmative responses: 42% said they would kill baby Hitler, 30% said they would not and 28% were undecided. The poll caused the hashtag #babyhitler to begin trending on Twitter, as the social media platform's users debated the subject.\nDuring the campaign for the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, when the question of killing baby Hitler was posed by journalists of HuffPost to Florida governor Jeb Bush, he responded \"Hell Yeah, I Would!\". While acknowledging the potential unknown consequences of such an action, he affirmed that he would still do it, saying \"You gotta step up, man.\" American engineer Paul J. Nahin commented that Bush had responded in this way in order to demonstrate \"the toughness of his character\", while pointing out that the Republican candidate also opposed abortion. The issue of killing baby Hitler was also raised during that year's Democratic Party presidential primaries, with New Hampshire primary candidate Vermin Supreme making it one of the four planks of his political platform. American actor Tom Hanks responded to the political debate by declaring that he would vote for a presidential candidate that supported killing baby Hitler. When the question was posed to Microsoft's chatbot Tay, it likewise replied that \"of course\" it would kill baby Hitler.\nIn contrast, American comedian Stephen Colbert responded to the question by saying that he would not kill baby Hitler and would instead seek to raise him in a loving home. In a 2018 interview with The Washington Post, American actor John C. Reilly responded similarly, calling for empathy with baby Hitler as an apolitical alternative. At the March for Life in 2019, American conservative pundit Ben Shapiro argued against killing baby Hitler from an anti-abortion position, stating that \"Baby Hitler was a baby.\" His comments drew criticism and mockery from liberal commentators. In response to his position on killing baby Hitler, three companies pulled their advertisements from Shapiro's podcast.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGenesis and Catastrophe: A True Story, a 1960 short story by Roald Dahl centering on the birth of baby Hitler and the fears that the baby may be too frail to survive\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Book chapters ===\n\n\n=== Journal articles ===\n\n\n=== News articles ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdwards, Phil (14 October 2016).

        "content": "The Penghu air raids were a series of air raids over the Japanese controlled Penghu Islands (Hōko Prefecture) by Allied bombers from 12 October 1944, to 14 August 1945. It begun in correspondence with the Formosa Air Battle but continued long after the latter's conclusion.\nThe air raids resulted in the mass destruction of infrastructure and military hardware on the islands, most notably at Magong due to the presence of major Japanese naval bases in the city.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1901, in view of the strategic position of Penghu Island in the Taiwan Strait, the Japanese government announced on 2 July that Penghu was to be a \"fortress\". The \"Penghu Fortress Command\" was established thereafter.\nOn 7 July 1937 the Marco Polo Bridge incident broke out and beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War, and on 15 August, all of Japanese-controlled Taiwan entered into a war economy. In June 1939, the Japanese army used Penghu as an advance base to attack Mainland China from Shantou, Guangdong.\nSince 1943 the situation in the Pacific War has become increasingly dire for the Japanese. In view of the barren land and large population in Penghu, it became difficult for the Japanese to supply grain by sea, leading to a real risk of food shortage. Residents were evacuated to Formosa and special liaison officers were stationed in Budai, Tainan Prefecture, and Takao Prefecture.\nIn the early days Japan chose Magong as the site for the construction of a major naval headquarters, and forced the residents to relocate to other places. In 1901, the Magong Port Department was formally established. In 1929, Japan once again expropriated the land around Mount Daian on the opposite bank for the construction of fuel tanks. In 1941, the Magong Yao Port Department was upgraded to the Magong Garrison Office. In 1943, the command center of the Garrison Office was moved to Kaohsiung Zuoying. In addition to auxiliary support facilities such as radio stations, port warehouses, and oil tanks, the hinterland of the base also became the main strategic target for the Allied fighters to attack Penghu.\nAfter the Magong air raid on 14 March 1945, the offices in various parts of Penghu were dispersed. Except for a few civil servants who stayed behind in Magong, most of the residents of Magong street went to the suburbs. At that time, Magong Street was in ruins with few people. It was not until the end of World War II that it gradually restored its original appearance.\n\n\n== Air raids ==\nOn 12 October 1944 the Formosa Air Battle broke out. From 12 to 14 October, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Task Force sent various carrier-based aircraft to bomb Formosa and Penghu. The first air raid in Penghu happened during this period, and as early as 8 October, four days before the first air strike, Magong Street had made preparations in advance to evacuate some school children and Japanese family members to prevent harm.\nThe mission to attack Penghu on 12 October 1944, was carried out by the USS Lexington and the USS Essex of the Fast Carrier Task Force; aircraft involved in the battle, including Grumman F6F Hellcats, Curtiss SB2C Helldivers and Grumman TBF Avengers, from dawn to dusk respectively weapons such as machine guns, rockets, bombs, and air-dropped torpedoes, launched a total of four waves of offensives against Penghu Cetian Island Naval Base, Zhumushuhui Airfield and surrounding facilities.\nAt the beginning of January 1945, in preparation for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, the Fast Carrier Task Force once again attacked various places in Formosa and Penghu. From mid-January of the same year, the Fifth Air Force of the U.S. Army Air Force took over the air strikes on Formosa and Penghu, in cooperation with the armed reconnaissance and patrol missions carried out by land-based patrol aircraft of the U.S. Navy. In August 1945, it was replaced by the Thirteenth Air Force.\nFrom 1944 to 1945 the total military and civilian population of the Penghu Office was about 79,000. Because Penghu had many military sites deemed important, it became a major target of bombing by the Allied Forces. Among them, the Fifth Air Force dropped a total of 1,127 tons of bombs on Penghu in the last 200 days of the war.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jack Satherley (17 December 1910 – 29 June 1994) was a rugby league player. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in 5 matches in 1937 and 1938 predominantly at hooker. In the process he became the 255th player to represent New Zealand. He previously played rugby union for Manukau Rovers in Auckland in the early 1930s before switching to the rugby league code in late 1933 when he joined the Richmond Rovers rugby league club. He also represented Auckland, Auckland Pākehā, and the North Island. His older brother was Cliff Satherley who also played rugby league for New Zealand.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLeslie Charles John Manson Satherley, more commonly known as Jack Satherley was born on December 17, 1910, in Blenheim. His parents were Ingress Cecilia Manson (1880–1930), and Charles Herbert Satherley (1865–1944). His mother had been married previously to Soren Hansen however she petitioned for divorce in February 1904. They had two children together, Sorine Elvine Hansen (b.1897) and William Claus Hansen (b.1900). The Star (Christchurch) newspaper reported from the proceedings that \"when fifteen years of age, in 1897, she married [Hansen] at Wellington, with her parents' consent, her father being present at the marriage. Respondent was alleged to have led a drunken life. Two years after the marriage her husband came home and said he \"had had enough of her, and was off\". Since then she had seen nothing of him. He was reported to be in Dannevirke, but inquiries failed to find him. She was ill after his desertion, and her baby [Sorine] 14 months old, died. Justice Cooper remarked upon \"criminal conduct of parents in consenting to such early marriages\"; a girl didn't know her own mind at fifteen, and she was not fit to bear children. Petitioner had not, at the time of her marriage, even reached the maximum school age”.\nShe remarried Charles Herbert Satherley in 1905. They had three children, Clifford (Cliff) (1907–1947), Phyllis Ida (1909–1986), and Jack. The first mention of Jack occurred in the Nelson Evening Mail on June 18, 1923. Jack, would have been aged 12 at the time. He was charged with riding a bicycle at night at Appleby without a light. He was fined 5 shillings.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Rugby union ===\n\n\n==== Manukau Rovers (1929-31) ====\nIt is unclear when exactly Jack moved to Auckland however his older brother began playing for the Manukau rugby union club in 1926 so it is likely Jack moved at the same time after their schooling. The first confirmed report of Jack playing senior rugby in Auckland was for Manukau on May 25, 1929. The match was played at Eden Park with Manukau losing 9–6 to University. The Sun (Auckland) newspaper wrote “Satherley, a brother of the forward [Cliff], who was given a trial on the wing, should develop into a useful man”. He nearly scored late in the game when he crossed the try line but was taken into touch in goal. Jack spent the remainder of the season back in Manukau's second grade side.\nHe began to be named in the Manukau senior A squads to start the 1930 season but was not mentioned in any match reports. In their loss to Ponsonby on May 24 he played in the forwards with The Sun saying “John Brimble, [Cyril] Pepper, Dixon, and J. Satherley were also honest packmen”. John Brimble was the older brother of Ted, Walter, and Wilfred who would all represent New Zealand at rugby league, with Wilfred and Walter both on the 1938 tour of Australia with Jack. While Cyril Pepper later became an All Black and was killed during World War 2. Jack then moved on to the wing for their following games including an 8–3 win over Training College on June 21 at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga which was their home ground with the club being based in Manukau in this era, not moving to Māngere until decades later. The following week in an 8–4 win over College Rifles he was involved in a “nice passing movement” with Cotter and Stewart which resulted in Pile scoring. In the second half he was warned by the referee for “rather wild work in the loose”. On July 5 Manukau lost to Marist 11-0 but Satherley was “noticeable in several good solo runs”. He played in further matches against Ponsonby, Training College (x2), and City before the season ended with a loss to University on September 13 and a default loss a week later to Technical College. The newspapers did not cover the matches in great detail so it is unknown how he played in these matches.\n\nThe 1931 season saw Satherley fully established in the first grade side, playing in 19 matches. He was credited with 2 tries though the newspapers would often omit scoring details from their match descriptions so it is likely that he scored several more given he was playing on the wing. His first game of the season was against Grammar Old Boys on May 2. In a 13–3 loss to University on May 9 on the wing he “showed pace and a clever swerve”. The New Zealand Herald reported that he received a cut on the head and retired” during the second half. A week later on May 16 Jack played against his brother Cliff who had transferred to Ponsonby at the start of the season. It was said that Cliff was one of the “most conspicuous among the pack” and he scored their lone try, with Manukau winning 9–5. Jack was said to have been “prominent” along with Biss on the other wing in Manukau's draw with Technical Old Boys on May 23. A week later Manukau lost to Grafton in Onehunga by 3 points to 0. With the score in Grafton's favour late “the two Stuarts, Biss, and Satherley were desperate in their efforts to smash the defence” but to no avail. The Auckland Star went on to say that “Satherley played a very determined game as winger, and was hard to stop when he saw the line ahead”. The same newspaper a week later described him as “sound” in their 3–3 draw with Marist. The Herald said that he was “outstanding” along with the Stuart brothers in the backs. He then gave “a dashing performance” on the right wing on June 13 against Training College. And played “well” on the wing in an 11–8 win over College Rifles at the Show Grounds on June 20. He scored Manukau's lone try in a 5–0 win on Eden Park No. 3 against Technical Old Boys on July 25. The try came after “a melee on the line, Satherley diving over” after “a rough and tumble”. It was said that he and fellow winger C. Stuart “were essentially individualists, lacking support”. He scored another try 2 weeks later on August 8 in an 11–3 win over College Rifles on Eden Park No. 3. He “dived over in the early stages” to give them a 3–0 lead. The Auckland Star said he was the only Manukau back “who showed any dash”. Though the NZ Herald said that both he and Bill Turei were “outstanding” on the wings.\nOn September 19 Manukau played in the final of the Pollard Cup against Technical Old Boys at Eden Park. Technical won 16–10. In the first half he “broke clean away, but when blocked, passed inside. Harris intercepted and pulled Tech. out of a difficult position”. His final two games of the season were a round 2 knockout game against Ponsonby which they won 8–6 on October 3. And then a 20–18 win over Patumāhoe in a friendly match on October 10 at the later teams ground.\n\n\n=== Rugby League ===\n\n\n==== Richmond Rovers ====\nThere was no mention of Satherley playing rugby in Auckland or elsewhere in 1932. In fact he was not mentioned again until an October 14, 1933 game between the Richmond Rovers rugby league side against the touring St. George from Sydney, Australia. Richmond were a club based in the central Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn. St. George had finished runners up in the 1933 NSWRFL competition and were playing 7 matches in New Zealand. Richmond won 5 points to 3 with Satherley being involved in “fine inside back play” along with Roy Powell and Stan Prentice which “prevented the half-backs, Richard Daly and Tom Carey, from going far”.\nAt the start of the 1934 Auckland Rugby League season Satherley was named in Richmond's round 1 side to play Newton Rangers on April 28 at Carlaw Park. He went on to play 20 games for them during the year. He played at second five eighth (inside centre) in their 18–7 win over Newton with the Herald saying “Prentice is not yet quite at his best, but has a promising second five eighth in J. Satherley”. He had been reunited with his brother Cliff who had switched to Richmond in May, 1933. In a 16–9 win over Devonport United on May 26 it was said that R. O’Donnell and Allan Seagar of the Shore side “caught Prentice and J. Satherley in possession... many times”. A week later in a 3–2 win against Newton he “frequently shone out in good defence”.\nOn July 11 Satherley actually played a rugby union game for the Engineers against the Police. He was employed by the railway at the time. As the match was employment based and did not require players to be registered with rugby union it was allowed. He scored a try in the Engineers 18–8 win and also kicked a conversion. Fellow league player Dan Keane from the Ponsonby club also scored a try and kicked two goals. After returning to the Richmond side on July 21 he switched places during the match with Bert Cooke the legendary former All Black international, who had switched to rugby league in 1932. Cooke had started at fullback but with Richmond lacking attacking spark he was moved into Satherley's place at second five eighth. Richmond went on to win 13–10. He started at fullback the following week with Richmond winning 18–0 to seal the Fox Memorial championship with three rounds still remaining. The Auckland Star reported that he “did fairly well in a new position, but was well protected by Eric Fletcher at centre”. The Herald said that he, along with several other Richmond backs “did great work in checking the opposing forwards”.\nSatherley then went on tour with the Richmond team with matches played at New Plymouth against the Taranaki side, and at Napier against the Hawke's Bay side on August 9 and 11 respectively. It is unknown if he played in the game with Taranaki but he was named in the side to play Hawke's Bay at fullback. Richmond won the first match 23-22 while the second was more lop-sided with Richmond winning 37–11.\nAfter returning to Auckland he played for Richmond in their 26–5 win over Devonport on August 18 in round 1 of the Roope Rooster competition. He “cleverly produced [their] opening try” assisting Eric Fletcher to score. He was back playing at second five, and the New Zealand Herald was critical of his performance overall saying that “he is too slow [in that position] for the company he is in and several times on Saturday he nullified promising movements by the Richmond rearguard”. In the semi finals he scored his first ever try for Richmond and followed it up later in the game with a second. They won 21–13 over Ponsonby United. He and Prentice “went well together, but the inside back tactics were hardly sharp enough”. The Herald wrote that “the conditions suited J. Satherley, who played well and scored two nice tries”. In the final, on September 8 against Marist Old Boys he scored once more in their 20–13 win. He was part of a “strong back combination” of Prentice, Powell, Fletcher, and Cooke, all of whom played for New Zealand. Satherley's try came after Powell kicked ahead before Ray Lawless gathered and sent him over “for a fine try” with the Herald saying he played “his usual sound game”.\nWith the season in its later stages the Western Suburbs side from Sydney was on a 5 match tour of Auckland. Western Suburbs were the NSW champions and had played games against Marist and Newton before a game with Richmond on September 29. Satherley was named at second five eighth with Stan Prentice at first five. Richmond won 18 to 16 before 15,000 spectators at Carlaw Park with Satherley supporting Prentice well and the two of them “frequently conspicuous for good play”. In a review of the players play later in the week the Herald said “great improvement on attack was also shown by J. Satherley, while his defence was as sound as ever”. The Western Suburbs side played a Ponsonby XIII on October 3 before a second game against Richmond to conclude their tour on October 6. He started at second five but at halftime he moved to fullback with Bert Cooke coming up to take his place. In the first half Prentice and Satherley “bottled up” Vic Hey and Percy Williams and “broke the back of the Australian attack”. Williams was actually a future Australian international and a guest player from the South Sydney brought on tour to strengthen the side. His final match of the season was against Newton in the Stormont Shield final on October 13. Richmond won 21–5 to become the first team to ever win all three major first grade trophies (Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, and Stormont Shield) in the same season. Satherley was said to have played “a sound game at fullback”.\n\n\n==== Moved into the Richmond forwards (1935) ====\nThe 1935 season saw Satherley move into the forwards for Richmond. He mainly played in the second row and at lock but also was tried out at hooker, and at the end of the year in his last game played at second five once more. In total he was not as busy, playing 15 games and not being selected for a handful of matches. His first game was against Newton on April 27 with Richmond winning 27–15. He was playing with his brother Cliff in the forwards and they, along with Joe Ginders, Alf Broadhead, and Ray Lawless “were a power in the open”.\nOn May 11 against Devonport, Satherley made possibly his first ever appearance at hooker, a position he was to ultimately represent New Zealand in two years later. The Auckland Star reported that he “was only fair in winning the ball from [Tony] Milicich”. Following a 5–3 loss to Mount Albert United on June 3 “[Harold] Tetley, C. Satherley, J. Satherley, and Lawless” were the best of the forwards”. While another article echoed those comments saying “Broadhead, Tetley, and the Satherley brothers were hard workers in the heavy ruck”. A week later on June 29 he “played a fine game in the Richmond forwards…” in their 28–0 win over Devonport.\n\n. Due to the nature of the hooker position in this era Satherley was not mentioned much in match reports as the majority of his work was confined to scrummaging. There were many more than there are in the modern game and the contest was much more physically demanding. The next mention of him was in a game on August 31 in the semi final of the Roope Rooster. Richmond had beaten the same team 3 weeks earlier to claim the Fox Memorial first grade championship title once more. In the knockout match Richmond won again, 20–6 with Satherley scoring his only try of the year. With Lawless playing a great game it was mentioned that Bill Telford and “the Satherley brothers were a tower of strength in the loose”. The players wore white armbands as a mark of respect for their coach Thomas McClymont who's father had died during the week. McClymont was New Zealand's most successful rugby league coach, coaching the New Zealand side in 1928, and again from 1936 to 1952, as well as coaching Richmond through their historical era in the 1930s as well as Ponsonby, Auckland, and Canterbury, and later Northern Districts. Previous to this he played 100 games for Ponsonby, 17 for Auckland, and 16 for New Zealand. In the final a week later on September 7, Satherley had a chance to tie the scores against Newton. It was a rare (penalty) kick at goal for Jack as usually it was his brother Cliff doing the kicking. However he was away with the Auckland side, along with Bert Cooke, Eric Fletcher, and Bill Telford. The Auckland Star wrote “there was a breathless hush as J. Satherley placed the ball well out from the uprights, sighted and then set it in flight with a powerful kick. Unfortunately for Richmond the kick went astray, and they trooped off the field the defeated side – a rare experience for them over the past two seasons”. His final game of the season was against the same Newton side in the Stormont Shield final. Richmond avenged their loss with a 26–15 win on September 14. He and Prentice were reunited in the five eighths but were said to be “a little slow on attack, but did useful work on defence”. They were apparently “shaded in the early stages when Newton opened with Elan, winning the set scrums and by possessive cohesion were making the play. Later, however, the pair, with Powell varying his methods behind the pack, were seen to better advantage”.\n\n\n==== Auckland and North Island selection (1936) ====\nIn 1936 Jack Satherley made his rugby league representative debut. He played 2 games for Auckland, and was also selected for the North Island team to play in their annual match with the South Island. He was busy for Richmond, playing in 19 games, scoring 2 tries. His first match of the season was in a ‘special opening match’ for Richmond against Mount Albert on April 18 before the championship properly began two weeks later. Richmond lost 22–15.\nSatherley was then named in their opening Fox Memorial championship match with Ponsonby on May 2. In a 13–12 loss to Mount Albert on May 16 he and Metcalfe were said to be “the best forwards” for Richmond. A week later in a 23–13 win against Marist he was “prominent among the forwards” along with Harold Tetley, and Bill Telford. He “played well” once more in a 19–14 win over Newton a week later on May 30. In the main 3pm match at Carlaw Park the following week Harold Tetley was the best Richmond forward but “was well supported by Telford, J. Satherley, [Hermes] Hadley, and [Alf] Broadhead”. Satherley scored his first try of the season in the 13–13 draw with Devonport (North Shore). Then in round 6 in a 15–6 win over Ponsonby, Satherley was said to be “in the thick of the heavy rucking” along with Alf Broadhead.\nFollowing the game against Ponsonby, Satherley was selected in the Auckland team to make his debut for them. Auckland was playing two matches on the same day with neither distinguished as an A or B team. Satherley's side was to play Wellington at Carlaw Park at 1:30pm and featured 6 current or future New Zealand internationals, with the other team playing Auckland Māori at 3pm featuring 10 current or future New Zealand internationals. Satherley was selected at hooker, between props Bill Telford (Richmond) and John Donald (Devonport). He was opposed in the Wellington scrum by Dick Moisley, the former Marist and Auckland representative who had moved to Wellington years earlier. Auckland won 25–22 with Satherley said to be among the best of the Auckland forwards. He “scored from nice in-and-out passing” to give Auckland a 19–6 lead. Returning to the Richmond side Satherley scored another try in their 27–11 win over Manukau on June 27. The Herald said that “Telford, J. Satherley, Hadley, and Metcalfe were prominent among a good set of forwards”.  After the match he was named in a training squad for Auckland to play the England in a months time by selector Bert Avery. His weight was published next to his name as being 11 stone, 9 pounds. The following weekend Richmond drew 11–11 with Mount Albert with Satherley named as being one of Richmond's best forwards.\nSatherley was then selected to make his debut for the North Island team for their July 11 match with the South Island. The selector was Bert Avery and he named Frank Pickrang (Auckland) and Joe Cootes (Wellington) to prop either side of him. He was opposed by Reg Ward (Canterbury). The New Zealand Herald noted that “Pickrang, Satherley, [Edgar] Morgan, [John] Anderson and Tetley, all of Auckland, have been outstanding in club games this season”. The North Island won a close match by 21 points to 16 before a crowd of 15,000 at Carlaw Park. Satherley then returned to the Richmond side for their round 11 match with Marist on July 18. In atrocious conditions on the number 2 field at Carlaw Park, Richmond won 3–0. In comments about the prospects of players vying for Auckland selection it was said in the Herald that “Satherley is … a good forward, but he has not met with outstanding success as a hooker”.\nOn July 20 Satherley was named in the Auckland team to play the touring England side at Carlaw Park on July 25. The Herald wrote that “Satherley, hooker, has a difficult task, as he has not been outstanding in this department in club football”. He was hooking against the very experienced Tommy Armitt who was in his 7th season of professional rugby league and who would ultimately play 355 games for Swinton, 10 tests for England, and 8 tests for Great Britain. Auckland lost 22–16 in a “valiant” effort in heavy conditions. The Auckland Star wrote after the game that “the English forwards dwarfed their opponents, but, despite the “mountains of flesh” which they had to carry about, they were surprisingly nimble. T. Armitt, the hooker, had weight to spare for raking the ball and he was rarely beaten for possession by J. Satherley, the Auckland hooker”. It went on to say that “Tetley, S. Watene and A. Gault were a pair of willing workers… while Satherley was always using his weight when required”. At one point in the first half the Auckland forwards broke away with Watene and Satherley heading the movement, but Jim Brough saved the situation for England though New Zealand was awarded a penalty and Watene's successful kick tied the scores at 9–9 before England worked their way back into a lead which they never relinquished. In remarks on the scrums in the Dominion newspaper they said that England “were penalised for handling in the scrum, for shepherding, and because T. Armitt, in the middle of the front row, developed a trick of catching the legs of his opposite number, J. Satherley, between his own when the ball was put in the scrum, and leaving the hooking to be done by the men on the side, either [Nat] Silcock or [Harry] Woods”.\nSatherley returned to his Richmond side for the remainder of the season. Richmond had been leading the championship but lost to Devonport on August 22 by 5 points to 3. It was noted that “except for Hadley, whose keenness got him occasionally into offside trouble, and J. Satherley, the Richmond forwards were shaded”. The Herald also observed that Hadley was the best forward “while C. Satherley and J. Satherley worked hard”. A week later in a 10–2 win over City Satherley was again “prominent”. On September 12 Richmond lost their semi final match in the Roope Rooster competition to City 10–8. Alf Broadhead was Richmond's best forward with Cliff and Jack Satherley giving “good support”. He then missed Richmond's semi final game in the consolation Phelan Shield knockout competition on September 19 and was instead given permission to play for the Auckland Post and Telegraph rugby union team against the Wellington Post and Telegraph side in an annual game among their employees. The match was played as curtain-raiser to Auckland B v King Country at Eden Park. The Auckland Post and Telegraph team won 17–14 with Satherley scoring a try and giving “a fine exhibition”. Richmond had qualified for the Stormont Shield final against Manukau by virtue of the fact that they had finished runner up in the championship and Manukau had also won the Roope Rooster so Richmond was considered the ‘second best team’ in the course of the season. Richmond won easily by 30 points to 9 on October 3 to finish their season. Late in the first half  Satherley picked up a dropped ball and “passed to [Owen] Wilkie who scored”.\n\n\n==== New Zealand debut (1937) ====\nIn 1937 Satherley made his debut for New Zealand in the second test against the touring Australia side. He also played for Auckland against South Auckland (Waikato), and Auckland Pākehā against Auckland Māori, along with 18 games for Richmond.\nHis first game of the season was for Richmond against Manukau in a preliminary round game at Carlaw Park on April 17. It was reported in the New Zealand Herald on April 21 that Satherley would be the hooker for Richmond for the season. In their first Fox Memorial championship game Richmond beat Mount Albert 13–10 on May 1 with Satherley “always prominent in the forward line” along with George Mitchell, Bill Telford, and Harold Tetley. Satherley's brother Cliff had transferred to the Mount Albert club where he was player-coach. In a 15–13 loss to North Shore a week later Satherley was again named as one of their best forwards along with Mitchell and Telford.\nSatherley was named in the 'Auckland' side to play a 'Māori' team at Carlaw Park on May 12. This was the first time ever that the two sides had met though it would become a more regular fixture over the following decades, and from the following year onwards the teams were more specifically named Auckland Pākehā, and Auckland Māori/Tāmaki. Satherley was named at hooker with Bill Breed (Marist) and Angus Gault (Manukau_ at prop. The Pākehā team won 24 to 14. On May 15 in a 24–6 win over City Satherley “was outstanding for his consistent hooking”. He was not named for their following game against Marist but was named a week later on May 29 against Newton. In a 15–6 win against Ponsonby on June 5 he was “prominent among the forwards throughout”.\nSatherley was selected by former international Hec Brisbane to play for Auckland against South Auckland (Waikato) on June 9. Such was the strength of Auckland rugby league they also chose a side to play Taranaki on the same day. Both teams featured several New Zealand internationals and were of a similar strength with neither singled out as being an 'A' or 'B' team. He was hooker between Bill Breed and Bill Telford once more, with G. Wintle the South Auckland (Waikato) hooker. Auckland won the match 26–12. Returning to Richmond he played in their crucial 15–2 win over Mount Albert on July 3 and gave “good assistance” to Jack McLeod along with Hermes Hadley, and Bill Telford.\nSatherley was then named in a New Zealand trial match in the New Zealand Possibles side by selectors Bert Avery and Thomas McClymont. It was later reported however that Satherley was unavailable and he was replaced by Bert Leatherbarrow.\n\n\n===== New Zealand test selection =====\nOn Monday, August 9 Satherley was requested to report for training at the Auckland gymnasium that evening. Eleven players had been called upon following the first test loss (8–12) to Australia 2 days earlier. The Australian team played New Zealand Māori on the Wednesday and suffered an upset loss 5-16. The New Zealand selectors, Jim Amos, Thomas McClymont, and Bert Avery then named the second test team with Satherley chosen at hooker. The props would be Angus Gault, and Billy Glynn. Glynn had played hooker in the first test but the selectors had decided to go with a hooking specialist in Satherley for the second match. It was reported that Jack McLeod had picked up an injury in the Māori team's win where he played well at hooker. He had played at lock in the first test. The Herald then wrote later that “the omission of McLeod, who was the successful hooker in the Māori team, comes as a surprise. It is understood McLeod was not injured on Wednesday and his place as hooker is being taken by Satherley, of the Richmond club”. He was opposed by Australian hooker Fred Nolan from the North Sydney club.\nThe second test was played at Carlaw Park on August 14 and saw New Zealand register an upset 16–15 win over an injury ravaged Australian side before 25,000 spectators. In the first half Pearce left the field with a broken leg. Then with Australia leading at halftime 15-6 they lost Jim Gibbs to a rib injury shortly after the resumption. Soon after, Satherley went “bursting over to score under the uprights” with George Nēpia converting to narrow the score to 15–11. In the build up Satherley had been associated in a “nice passing bout” with Joe Cootes and Billy Glynn which led directly to the try. Later Nēpia kicked a penalty and then [[Noel Bickerton crossed for a try to give New Zealand the lead before Wally Prigg was also forced from the field with a shoulder injury before the game ended with New Zealand victors. The Herald later said that “Cootes and Satherley gave valuable support and the latter’s try was a fine effort”.\n\n\n===== Richmond's 3rd title =====\nSatherley then returned to his Richmond side who suffered a 30-24 loss to Marist. Richmond were in the championship lead at the time but the loss meant that going into the final round their lead was narrowed to one point over Marist and Mount Albert. Satherley scored a try in the loss and was one of the best Richmond forwards. His try came after Bill Glover made a good tackle on him but Jack McLeod gained possession and sent the ball back to Satherley to cross for the try. The try gave them the lead but a flurry of points saw Marist take a commanding 12 point lead into the half time break. With Richmond needing to win their final round match against Newton to secure the first grade championship they won comfortably by 30 points to 9 to win the title for the 3rd time in 4 seasons. Satherley scored two tries in the win. The Auckland Star wrote that “Satherley and Alf Broadhead were always on hand when there was hard work to be done. Satherley incidentally played one of his best games to date and scored twice as a result of fine breakaways”. The Herald also said that Satherley “played his best game this season” and both his tries were “runaways”. Richmond were knocked out of the Roope Rooster and Phelan Shield competitions in the first round before their final game of the season against Marist in the Stormont Shield final on October 2. Marist won 12-5 though “J. Satherley gave his side signal service in that he won the ball for Richmond with consistency from the set scrums”.\n\n\n==== New Zealand tour of Australia (1938) ====\nThe 1938 season saw Satherley once again selected to represent New Zealand when he was chosen for the tour of Australia. He also played for the North Island in their inter-island match, twice for Auckland, and 17 matches for Richmond. \nIn Richmond's opening round win over Papakura on April 9, Satherley scored a try. It came after Noel Bickerton and Wally Tittleton combined for Satherley to “race across”. In mid May Satherley was chosen in the Auckland team to play the ‘Rest of the North Island’ side by selectors Bert Avery, Hec Brisbane, and A. Renwick. The Auckland Star wrote “Satherley, of Richmond, is the selectors’ choice as hooker, and his supports will be Gault, of Manukau, and [Des] Herring, of Mount Albert”. He was opposed by W. Brooks of South Auckland (Waikato). Auckland thrashed their opposition by 67 points to 14 with Satherley scoring one of their 15 tries. Following the match he was selected for the North Island team to play the inter-island match against the South Island. The North Island won easily by 55 points to 2 on May 21 at Carlaw Park. Satherley scored a try after Des Herring, Walter Brimble, and Jack Brodrick “were associated in a passing bout” with Satherley finishing it off to give them a 20–2 lead.\n\nSatherley was then selected for the New Zealand team to tour Australia. The selectors were Thomas McClymont, Hec Brisbane, and Jim Amos. The Auckland Star remarked that “Orman, the Buller player, proved on Saturday that he is a hooker of great ability, and Satherley, who has played consistently in Auckland club football, showed that he is a good man for the position, provided that the weight is put in by the others. Last season there was a hooking weakness evident, and the standard set by players of the calibre of [Sam] Lowrie and [Wally] Somers in the past was not reached. This year the weakness appears to be remedied”. The Herald said that “Satherley… will lack nothing in experience, and is also a good forward in the loose”. In profiles of the players they wrote “J.M. Satherley (Auckland) is 25 years of age and weighs 11st. 6lb. He is the other hooker and is capable in this department…” Prior to departing Satherley played a game for Richmond against Mount Albert on May 28 and scored a try. He was “always prominent” in the Richmond forwards and although opponent “Leatherbarrow hooked well, Satherley also got a good share of the ball for Richmond”.\nAfter arriving in Australia Satherley was named in the first match of the tour against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on June 11. New Zealand lost 25–12 before a crowd of 28,303 with Satherley opposed by Roy Kirkaldy. Despite the scoreline it was said that the New Zealand side impressed onlookers. Satherley was injured in the first half along with Bill McNeight but was able to continue. New Zealand had led during the second half before they lost Arthur Kay to injury and were overcome by New South Wales. The Truth newspaper in Sydney said that “Gault, McNeight, Satherley, and Herring were like tigers in close”. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that “New South Wales gained a two-thirds share of the ball from the scrummages, and in an effort to win more of the ball the New Zealand selectors have decided to change their front row. D. Herring and J. Satherley, the hooker, have been omitted, and their places filled by G. Orman, hooker, and J. Cootes”. New Zealand won the second match with New South Wales by 37 points to 18 on June 13. The team then travelled to Lismore to play North Coast on June 15. Satherley was recalled into the side at hooker with Joe Cootes and Des Herring his props. He was marking the North Coast captain J. Bond. New Zealand won 23–2 before 2,200 spectators at the Recreation Ground in Lismore. The Tweed Daily said that “it was not uncommon in the second half to see J. Cootes, Glynn, Satherley, and Herring in complete control of the ball, beating off the individual efforts of L. McLaren, J. Bond, J. Lever, and E. Norton”.\nThe next game was against Queensland on June 18 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground with George Orman preferred at hooker. W. Sneyd, a photographer for the Telegraph (Brisbane) wrote an opinion piece on the New Zealand side and said “the visitors will test our Queensland rake, because if either Satherley or Orman plays they will be equipped with an expert exponent of the art. Satherley, however, is just as likely to be troublesome in the open as he is in the scrum, because he is fast”. New Zealand lost heavily by 31 points to 11 and the New Zealand Herald later wrote “another great handicap to the touring team was the loss of possession from the scrums. It is surprising that the selectors should see fit to include Orman in preference to Satherley as hooker. Orman has only recently joined the code and has yet to learn the finer points of hooking. On the other hand, Satherley has had wide experience in this department and has improved each season. Even in the recent inter-island match at Carlaw Park, Satherley proved a superior hooker to Orman and, in addition, he is a better all round forward. It would appear, therefore that the selectors would be fully justified in giving Satherley the position in the big games ahead”. Orman was still selected at hooker for the next match against Toowoomba on June 22 which New Zealand won 12–11 with Satherley not playing. Curiously for the second match against Queensland on June 25 Satherley was selected but in the lock position with Orman at hooker once more. It was reported that the New Zealand side had been concentrating on scrummaging at training along with playing the ball and they hoped for “more possession as a result of the altered interpretation of the play-the-ball rule” which was going to be in line with the English interpretation. New Zealand performed much better than their previous match with the same opponent but still lost 21–12 on June 25. The Telegraph said that Satherley and Wally Tittleton “were keeping a close tag on [five eighth] Reardon, who, however did as much as he was able”. Queensland won the penalty count 23-14 and the scrums 28 to 26. The Sunday Mail said that “Satherley was a source of great trouble to Queensland by his sound tackling”. The Referee newspaper also said “Satherley at breakaway tackled ably and performed well allround”.\nSatherley then moved back into the hooking position for New Zealand's next match on June 29 against NSW Group 4 at Tamworth Oval. New Zealand won 26–15 after leading 16–0 at halftime. He was named to play at lock forward once more for their July 2 match with Newcastle at the Newcastle Sports Ground but was said to be suffering from a heavy cold and ultimately did not play. He was named as a reserve for the final match of the tour against Sydney but was not required to play. The team then arrived back in Auckland on the morning of July 11 on board the (MV Aorangi (1934)|Aorangi]] ship. After their return one of the managers of the team, Jack A. Redwood said that “neither Satherley nor Orman… could overcome the opposition they met in the big matches, but the latter showed up well in other branches of play”. He was also quoted as saying that the two hookers “Orman and Satherley, were able to gain their fair share of the ball toward the end of the tour. All the forwards played well and it was unfortunate that Tetley, Satherley, and Gault were injured”. New Zealand played one final match after returning which was against the Auckland side but Satherley was in the reserves and not required to play.\n\nSatherley then returned to the Richmond side for the remainder of the season. He was selected in the Auckland team to play Canterbury on August 13. The side was made up entirely of Richmond and Manukau players who were not playing club matches on the day. Despite it being chosen from just two teams the side was still a strong one with ten of the thirteen players being New Zealand representatives. Auckland won a close game 28–22. He then played in Richmond's 20–8 win over City in the final of the Roope Rooster knockout competition. Satherley was named in Richmond for their October 1 match against the touring Eastern Suburbs side. The Herald suggested that Satherley “is likely to gain a good share of the ball for the backs”. Before a crowd of 11,000 Richmond won 11–9. Jack McLeod and Satherley “in particular being at the top of their form”. The Herald wrote that Satherley “has never been seen to better advantage in all-round play. His tackling and following up were splendid, and, as was anticipated, he gave his side a good share of the ball from the scrums”. With Eastern Suburbs leading 3-0 Richmond went on attack and following good work by Merv Devine, Watkins, and McLeod “Satherley snapped up, to give a perfect “dummy” to Norton and scored”. With the score 11-9 “just before time Robinson and Arnold carried the ball near the Richmond line, but Satherley saved with a splendid low tackle”. After the game in an interview the manager of the touring side, Mr. J. Quinlan said “the splendid tackling of the Richmond players also impressed him”, praising Wally Tittleton and Satherley in particular.\n\n\n==== Richmond (1939) ====\nThe 1939 season saw Satherley playing for Richmond once more but perhaps surprisingly he was not selected for the aborted New Zealand tour of England. In round 1 of the championship Satherley was injured in Richmond's 15–14 win over City and had to go off. Jack McLeod replaced him at hooker and played well. He was only named intermittently over the following 2 months and may have missed some matches. On June 10 Richmond beat City 8–0 in round 10 with the Herald writing that “Satherley won the ball from the scrum frequently and his hooking was cleaner that that of Airey, a former Canterbury representative”. In a 26–14 win over Marist on June 17 he set up Dave Solomon's try after he kicked through for Solomon to score.\nSatherley was then named in the reserves for the North Island v South Island, and Possibles v Probables set of games at Carlaw Parkon July 8. The hooker chosen for the North Island was J. Brooks of Waikato while Maurice Quirke and Bert Leatherbarrow both from Auckland were chosen to hook in the other match. Following the matches a further New Zealand trial was arranged for July 11 between the Possibles and Probables with Satherley named at hooker in the Probables side, playing opposite J. Brooks. The Auckland Star said “Brooks, of South Auckland [Waikato], and Satherley, of Richmond, will be matched as hookers, and both will have good support. The Probables side won 27-18 with it said that Brooks and Satherley “were exceptionally well matched as hookers, and both got a fair share of the ball for their respective teams”. Satherley was involved in their first try after he and John Clark of Canterbury “raced away and from a scramble George Mitchell scored”.\nHe then returned to his Richmond side to finish the season. On July 22 in a 23–14 loss to Manukau he “received a nasty face injury and was treated at hospital”. It appears he was not too badly injured as he was named in the side to play the following week against Papakura. On August 19 the Richmond side traveled to Huntly to play South Auckland (Waikato) and won 21–16. It was said that “good hooking by J. Satherley had much to do with the defeat of” the local side. It is unclear if he played in any of Richmond's remaining games and he was left off the team list completely for their final games against Manukau on September 16 and City on September 30.\n\n\n==== Retirement and return (1942) ====\nIt appears that late in 1939 Satherley had decided to retire from the game. He did not play at all in 1940 aside from a rugby league veterans game between Auckland Veterans and South Auckland Veterans at Carlaw Park on October 19. The match was for the Les Lees Challenge Cup with both sides being entertained after the match by the New Zealand Rugby League Old Boys Club at a dinner at Hotel Auckland. The Auckland side was particularly strong with 10 of the 13 starting players former New Zealand representatives. The Auckland side won 31–18 with Satherley scoring one of their seven tries, most of which were converted by Craddock Dufty. Satherley did not play at all in 1941.\nThen in 1942 Satherley came out of retirement to rejoin the Richmond side once more. With World War 2 well underway many senior sides were struggling for playing numbers and many players came out of retirement to play for their former clubs. There was much less reporting of games due to the dominance of war reporting and so it is unclear exactly how many games Satherley played though it was most likely around 18, and he scored 6 tries which was the most in his club career in a single season. It was reported on April 20 that he would be available for their opening match. Despite not having played a serious competition match for around 2+1⁄2 years he scored three tries in a 22–10 win over the combined Marist-North Shore side. In reality it was against Marist as the North Shore club had refused to contribute any players to the forced merger team until a change of mind in round 7. The New Zealand Herald said that “J. Satherley, the Richmond hooker, was in good form and scored three tries”. A week later he scored again in their 27–4 win against Ponsonby. Then in round 5 on June 6 he scored another try and kicked the only goal of his career which was a penalty in their 23–17 loss. Both teams scored 5 tries but Richmond had missed all of their conversion attempts. He had only been mentioned as attempting a goal kick one other time in his career though he had been photographed practising his goal kicking while on the 1938 tour of Australia. Team lists were not published at all in the Auckland newspapers and the match reports were extremely brief, with Satherley not mentioned at all until September 12 when he scored a try in Richmond's 7–6 win in the Roope Rooster semi final against Ponsonby.\n\n\n==== Retirement and return once more (1945) ====\nSatherley once more retired from the game, not playing at all in the 1943 and 1944 seasons. He did however make a full comeback in 1945 for Richmond. He played 20 games scoring 5 tries. He played in their opening games against Point Chevalier and North Shore which they both won. Satherley played at prop for their April 28 win over Newton. Richmond recorded a record score with their 70–0 win with Satherley scoring twice. At hooker was Ernie Pinches who later became deputy mayor and then acting mayor in 1987/88. Richmond then lost to Mount Albert on May 5 by 11 points to 7. With Richmond trailing 8-3 early in the second half Satherley “broke away and raced 30 yards before passing to [Aubrey] Thompson, who was soundly tackled”. The Auckland Star wrote “J. Satherley, an experienced hooker, was also prominent in the loose”. Satherley scored in a 25–7 win against Ponsonby on June 2.\nOn August 11 in an 11–7 win over Manukau Satherley scored another try however the win was overshadowed by foul play against Satherley by Joseph Zimmerman. Following the match an inquiry was held by the Auckland Rugby League “in connection with an incident near the end of the game when J. Satherley, one of the Richmond players was injured, and lay on the ground for some time receiving attention. At the time of the incident a set scrum was being formed, and Satherley was seen to reel and fall”. It was also reported that the injury was the result of “what appeared to be a wilful head butt by a Manukau forward”. His try earlier had come as a result of “a passing bout” and he also “did good work in the loose”. Zimmerman was later found guilty by the Auckland Rugby League control board and suspended for the remainder of the season. On September 1 in a championship final match against Ponsonby, which was later essentially downgraded to a semi final fixture, Richmond beat Ponsonby 7–3. At one stage he “stormed the Ponsonby goal line” with Richmond going close to adding to their 7–0 lead in rainy conditions. Richmond then lost what was then set up as the Fox Memorial championship decided to Otahuhu Rovers on October 13 by 11 points to 5. The final match of Satherley's career came on September 29 in the Roope Rooster final loss to North Shore by 22 points to 12. Satherley scored a try in his last game.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJack Satherley worked as a lineman and in 1935 was living with Alma (Wilma) Florence Purdy at 235 Ponsonby Road, Ponsonby, in central Auckland. Satherley and Purdy were married on October 16, 1937. Alma's father passed away on November 12, 1937, with a memorial notice published by Alma and Jack. They had four children, Richard Anthony Satherley (1939-?), and Sylvia Fay Iwan Satherley (1937-?), Ella Louise Satherley (1940–40), and another daughter born on October 12, 1943, while they were living at 4 Dublin Street in Ponsonby. Tragedy struck the family on February 25, 1940, when their daughter Ella Louise died aged 3 days while the family was living at 4 Dublin Street in Ponsonby. Then on August 8, 1943, they had another daughter.\nIn 1941 he was groomsman at a relatives wedding in Palmerston North. According to military records in 1942 Satherley was living at 4 Dublin Street in Ponsonby and working for New Zealand Rail. On August 1, 1944, Jack's father Charles passed away at the age of 79. He had been living with Jack at the time.\nIn 1947 Jack's brother Cliff Satherley passed away in Wellington on January 7. The Evening Post in Wellington reported that “Clifford Allen Martin Satherley, aged 39” had been missing since 7 am yesterday. He was “dressed only in a pair of short woollen underpants” and had been a patient of the Wellington Public Hospital. Police search parties had been trying to find him for some time and he was believed to have last been seen at 7:10am after leaving the hospital. The police had also stated that “they had received a further report that a man answering the description of Satherley had been seen on Mount Victoria about 5.15pm. His body was then found three days after his disappearance on Lyall Bay Beach “shortly before noon”.\nBy 1954 Jack and Alma were living at 38 Dedwood Terrace with Jack working as a foreman. By 1963 Jack was living at the same address on Dedwood Street though possibly alone after the death of his wife Alma on January 1, 1968, aged 54.\nJack was living at the same address in 1969 according to electoral records and living with Maureen P. Satherley who was a “spinster”, while Jack was working as a “Civil Servant”. By 1978 they were still living together at the same address with Jack working as a storeman and Maureen a secretary.\nJack died on June 29, 1994, aged 83. He was cremated with his ashes buried at Waikumete Cemetery in Glen Eden, Auckland.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Otter was a footballer who played in the 1877 FA Cup final for Oxford University.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOtter was born in 1856, the fifth son of Charles (an examiner in the Court of Chancery) and Elinor (née Parker), and educated at Winchester College, which was an early adopter of the association laws.  In 1870 he was the last pupil \"head\" to undergo the dangerous tradition of 'chairing'.  This involved the leading Queen's Scholar being carried on a raised chair around Great Dean's Yard and Little Dean's Yard, with Town boys ceremonially opposing the carrying, and creating a scuffle under the raised chair; the ceremony was abolished after Otter's chairing.In 1874, he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, as a junior student, also taking a pupillage at Lincoln's Inn in 1876; he took a first in Honour Moderations in 1878.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nOtter was something of a prodigy at football; he made his debut in association football for Westminster School against Upton Park at Vincent Square on 22 October 1870, when he was not yet 15 years old.  Four days later he scored his first goal, the fourth in a 4–0 win over West Kent, after scrimmages before the Kentish posts.  However he missed much of the 1871–72 season through illness.\nHowever, for the 1873–74 season he was chosen as captain.  He also appeared as a guest player for Barnes in a handful of matches, the first being a defeat at the Royal Engineers in October, and played for the Wanderers, debuting for the famous club in a win over Gitanos in November.One month later, he made his FA Cup debut, playing for Wanderers against Oxford University, although unusually as a full-back.  The match ended in a draw and he was moved up front for the replay at the University Parks, but a weakened Wanderers went down 1–0.He made his representative debut for the Middlesex county side against Surrey at the Kennington Oval in January 1874, and scored the final Middlesex goal with a cross-shot in a 4–2 win.For the 1874–75 FA Cup, his loyalties switched to his university, and scored the decisive second goal in the third round win over the Wanderers.  He was also now able to play in the Varsity match against Cambridge University, which he did twice; the first time in the autumn 1874 match, which went Cambridge's way (although Otter was singled out for the quality of his play), and the second time in November 1875, which Oxford won 4–1, Otter scoring the first goal, shortly after which injury reduced Oxford to 10 men.He remained a regular in the Oxford side until the 1877–78 FA Cup, and demonstrated \"clever\" dribbling in the 1877 FA Cup final, despite which the university lost to the Wanderers.  His final match of note was for the Wanderers in their closing match of the 1877–78 season, against the Vale of Leven at the Oval, the game ending 3–1 to the visitors.Otter was also a noted athlete, finishing second in the Varsity athletics hammer throw in 1878 with a throw of 98' 10\".\n\n\n== Post-university ==\nOtter joined the Indian Civil Service in 1878, being sent out as an assistant to the magistrate of Tinnevelly in the Madras Presidency.  He returned to England in 1879, suffering from dysentery, of which he died at the end of that year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Khorasani (Xorasani) dialect is one of the dialects of the Persian language that some people in the historical regions of Khorasan and Qumis speak. The Khorasani dialect was spoken by the native and original people of this historical territory, which encompassed the modern-day countries of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and all the northeastern parts of Iran.\nThe Persian dialect of Khorasani is one of the original and important dialects of the Persian language. It is valued highly due to the large number of people who speak it and also due to the strong base that the Persian language has always had in Khorasan. Many words that were part of the Middle Persian language are still popular and have remained alive and working in Khorasani, but have been lost in other Persian dialects.\n\n\n== Sub-divisions ==\n\nThe Khorasani dialect is generally divided into two groups: Eastern Khorasani and Western Khorasani.\nEastern Khorasani (or Tajiki) is spoken in central and eastern parts of Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\nWestern Khorasani is spoken in Khorasan Province and eastern parts of Semnan Province in Iran, and Herat and surrounding provinces in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe Khorasani Persian dialect is the only Iranian Persian dialect that is spoken outside of Iran. It is spoken in the east from Herat, from the west to the border of Mazandaran (Shahroud, Damghan), and from the north in Bojnourd. However, as we move towards the north of Khorasan, the presence of Kurdish and Turkic languages of Khorasan and the effects of these two languages on the Persian dialect of the region increases. From the south of Khorasan to the nearby city of Nehbandan, the dialects of Sistan and Kerman become more apparent.\n\n\n== Ivanov and Kolbasi’s Classification of Khorasani Persian ==\nIvanov divides the Khorasani dialects into three main groups: the northern group, which is spoken in Jovin, Sabzevar and Neishabur; the central group which is common in Tarshiz and Gonabad; and the southern group whose speakers live in Qain, Tun and Birjand. In his opinion, the difference between these three groups is very small and they cannot be considered separate dialects; In addition, these groups have borrowed many words from each other.\nHowever, unlike Ivanov, Kolbasi places the dialects of Khorasan region under a distinct branch of the modern south western Iranian languages, with varieties including Sabzevari, Nishabori, Kashmiri, Kakhki, Qaeni and Birjandi among the dialects, while considering Mashadi as a standard dialect of standard Iranian Persian.\n\n\n== Numbers ==\n\nNumbers in the Khorasani Persian dialect are not very different from standard Persian, but differ in pronunciation. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Casa de Ganaderos de Zaragoza or Brotherhood of San Simón y San Judas (House of Livestock Breeders of Zaragoza) is an institution of medieval origin that was established to defend the privileges granted by the kings to the cattle owners of the kingdom, also bringing together corporately mayorales and herders. After seeing its powers drastically reduced since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it changed its name and legal status (local board, association, union or cooperative, which is the one with which it continues to operate today; which makes it the oldest company in Spain).  The territorial breadth of its activity included ravines for the herds of sheeps transhumants from the Pyreneess valleys to the Sistema Ibérico of Teruel. As a privileged corporation of the Ancien Régime, it is similar to the Mesta Castilian, although it precedes it in time and survived it. Unlike the Crown of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon did not create a common institution for the whole kingdom, but in each locality, independent of each other and far from royal control. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the granting to the city of Zaragoza of the extensive grazing privileges by Alfonso the Battler after the conquest of the Muslim kingdom (1118), called the privilege of the Twenty and the privilege of the Universal Pasture (granted between 1129 and 1235 to several Aragonese localities), it was necessary to create institutions to regulate it, although it was not until 18 May 1218 that King James I of Aragon appointed Domingo de Montealteto Justice of the Cattle Breeders of Zaragoza, with civil and criminal jurisdiction over such matters (civil since 1391, according to the confirmation of privileges by King John I of Aragon). In 1229 the first texts appear that name the brotherhood, headed by the Justice, who is elected from among its members (from 40 to 80 brotherhoods), in addition to other positions, such as lieutenant of Justice, councillors, ligalleros, vedaleros and scribes.\nThe Zaragoza brotherhood will be the most prominent in the kingdom. The trials of the Justice were summary executions, including the death penalty, and he maintained his own gallows on the road to San Gregorio (Cascajo neighborhood). He came to have jurisdictional conflicts with the Justice of Aragon, without this institution being able to intervene in the private affairs of the Casa de Ganaderos. Conflicts with other Aragonese cities were also frequent, which provoked protests in the Cortes de Monzón of 1626 and the Cortes de Monzón of 1646.\nThis wide freedom enjoyed by Zaragoza may have been the reason why in the Alterations of Aragon, in which the city of Zaragoza took up arms against King Philip II of Spain, they did not find much help from the rest of the kingdom.\nIn the reign of King Philip V of Spain the judicial competences in criminal matters of the House were submitted to the Audience, and the Justice will be ratified in his appointment by the Audience.\nIn 1828, King Ferdinand VII, in exchange for a substantial payment, confirmed the privileges of the House except for the jurisdictional ones, and from then on the adaptation of the institution to the contemporary economic system began. \nThe archive of the House preserves documentary sources of great importance for the reconstruction of a large period of economic and social history. \nCurrently, celebrating its VIII centenary in 2018, it is dedicated to the commercialization of 1st quality lamb meat, from its partners.\n\n\n== Similar institutions ==\nThere is a House of Cattlemen of Tauste, of similar origin and operation,  and another in Ejea, with a brotherhood dedicated to Santo Domingo. There were other brotherhoods in towns throughout the Ebro region, from Logroño to Tortosa, including the Brotherhoods of the Bardenas of Navarra and Aragón from 1204 and others in Aragón from 1220. With the name of mestas, there were similar institutions in Tarazona and Albarracín; and with that of ligallo in Caspe, Teruel, Daroca, Calatayud and many other towns and even villages. In the Pyrenees there were facerías, pastoral boards and assemblies of a different nature (such as the Casa del Broto), and already in the CE 18th century, the General Board of Mountain Ranchers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Additional bibliography ==\nCanelles López (1981).

        "content": "Hedevig Christine Paus (29 October 1763 – 7 March 1848) was a Norwegian businesswoman and the grandmother of the playwright Henrik Ibsen. Henrik Ibsen's parents, Knud and Marichen—Hedevig's daughter—grew up as close relatives, sometimes referred to as \"near-siblings,\" and both belonged to the tightly intertwined Paus family at the Rising estate and in Altenburggården – that is, the extended family of the sibling pair Hedevig Paus and Ole Paus, who belonged to the merchant elite of Skien. Ibsen drew significant inspiration from his childhood environment and family, and named or modelled various characters after family members; the main character of \"Hedvig\" in his masterpiece The Wild Duck was named after her.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was born at Bjåland in Lårdal in 1763. A member of the regionally prominent Paus family of civil servants, she was the daughter of the forest inspector of Upper Telemark, Cornelius Paus, and Christine Falck. Cornelius's father and grandfather were both chief district judges of Upper Telemark. Hedevig was the sister of the ship's captain and shipowner Ole Paus, and of Martha Paus (1761–1786), who was married to the shipowner and timber merchant Hans Jensen Blom.\nIn 1794, she married the ship's captain Johan Andreas Altenburg, who early ceased sailing and settled down as a wealthy shipowner and merchant in Skien. At the beginning of the 1800s, the Altenburg family was among the wealthiest merchant families in the port city of Skien. Johan Andreas Altenburg \"owned properties valued between twenty and thirty thousand, including a large mansion, a spirits distillery at Lundetangen, which was the second largest in the county, as well as a farm in the countryside at Århus and two ships engaged in the timber trade.\"\nHer husband died in 1824, and she then took over his businesses. The following year, their daughter Marichen Altenburg married Knud Ibsen, who was the stepson of Hedevig's brother Ole Paus. Hedevig then transferred the assets to her daughter, and according to the laws of the time, they became the property of her son-in-law. The fortune enabled Knud Ibsen to establish himself as one of Skien's leading merchants in the late 1820s and early 1830s. One of her brother's sons, and Knud's half-brothers, Henrik Johan Paus, was also raised by Hedevig and Johan Andreas Altenburg. The families of Paus, Altenburg, and Ibsen were, therefore, very closely and intricately interwoven, and the marriage between Marichen and Knud has been described as \"a perfect family arrangement.\" Hedevig Paus was the grandmother of Henrik Ibsen.\nHenrik Ibsen named many literary characters after family members, and he gave his grandmother's name to the character \"Hedvig (Ekdal)\" in The Wild Duck. Ibsen also wrote that he had used his own family and childhood memories as the model for the Gynt family in Peer Gynt.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Maria Margarida Gil Lopes' (born 1950) is a Portuguese filmmaker, teacher and artist. She has been president of the Association of Portuguese Directors. She collaborated with and was married to the director, actor and film critic, João César Monteiro.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMargarida Gil was born on 7 September 1950 in Covilhã, a city in the centre of Portugal, where she went to high school. In 1968, at the age of 17, she and her family moved to the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, where she attended the Faculty of Arts of the University of Lisbon at the same time as supporting herself by working at the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa. She graduated in Germanic Philology, although her earlier plans were to study fine arts and become a painter. \nGil began to attend sessions that the Cinemateca Portuguesa promoted, and during the showing of a cycle of films of the German director, F.W. Murnau, she met João César Monteiro, who was finishing the filming of his short film Quem Espera por Sapatos de Defunto Morre Descalço (Who Waits for the Dead Man's Shoes Dies Barefoot). Through this connection to Monteiro, she became close to many Portuguese film directors, meeting many of the leading lights at the time, such as António-Pedro Vasconcelos, Jorge Silva Melo, Solveig Nordlund, Alberto Seixas Santos, Paulo Rocha, and Fernando Lopes. Monteiro asked her to be the assistant director on his next film, Fragmentos de um Filme-Esmola: A Sagrada Família, shot in 1972 and 1973.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter the 1974 Carnation Revolution she got a job at Emissora Nacional, working on radio news programmes. In 1975 she returned to work with Monteiro in Que Farei com Esta Espada? (What will I do with this sword?), as an assistant director and actress. In 1976 she participated in the creation of Grupo Zero, a film production cooperative, with Seixas Santos, Nordlund, Monteiro, Melo, Acácio de Almeida, and others. In the same year she joined Radio Televisão Portuguesa (RTP), the renamed Emissora Nacional, directing several documentaries. Her work included Clínica Comunal Popular da Cova da Piedade, about an old building occupied by the people and then transformed into a clinic that would provide the first serious family planning in the area. It would be awarded a prize at Dok Leipzig, the Leipzig Film Festival. In 1978 she began to direct shows on RTP2. \nIn parallel, she continued her film career with Monteiro, by then her husband, working on his films, Veredas, as an assistant director and actress, O Amor das Três Romãs, as an actress, and Silvestre, as assistant director. In 1986, she was the executive producer of À Flor do Mar, produced by Monteiro & Gil, the production company they formed, which also produced her first feature-length work as a film director, Recção Fiel e Verdadeira (Faithful and True Relationship), shot in 1986, which was presented at the Venice Film Festival in 1987 but not shown in Portugal until 1989.\nSoon afterwards, she made the television film Flores Amargas, which looked at Timorese refugees housed near Lisbon. Other television films included several experimental films based on the life and work of the Portuguese poet and writer, Fernando Pessoa. In 1992, she made her second feature film, Rosa Negra (Black Rose), which was shown at the Locarno Film Festival but never had a commercial premiere. Subsequently, Gil made several video documentaries, notably Maria, for the World Conference on Women, 1995, which took place in Beijing, and As Chosen, about the life and work of the painter Graça Morais. In 1998, she made O Anjo da Guarda (The Guardian Angel), which received an award at the Rome Film Festival and the Figueira da Foz Film Festival. She then left RTP and began teaching and research at the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of NOVA University Lisbon. In 2003, she acted in Monteiro's last film Vai e Vem. Monteiro died in 2003. He had dedicated his 1998 film, As Bodas de Deus, to Gil.\nIn 2012 she released the film, Paixão. In February 2024 her film Mãos no Fogo (Hands in the Fire), a film loosely inspired by the horror novella, The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, was shown at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\n== Artistic work ==\nAfter 2000, while continuing to make films, Gil returned to her early love of painting, drawing and sculpture. An exhibition of her ceramic sculptures was held in Cascais in 2024. \n\n\n== Awards and Nominations ==\nIn 2005 Gil was awarded the Lifetime Career Award at the Rome Film Festival. In the same year she won the Feature Film Grand Prix at IndieLisboa for the film Adriana, which was also nominated for the 2006 Portugal Golden Globes, with Ana Moreira receiving the Best Actress award for her role in the film. In 2012 the Escola Superior Artística do Porto (ESAP) awarded Gil the Aurélio Paz do Reis Prize, in recognition of her cinematographic career.\n\n\n== Films ==\nGil's films include:\n\n1975 - Clínica Comunal Popular de Cova da Piedad (Documentary)\n1976 - Para todo o serviço (Documentary)\n1982 - Olho de Vidro: Uma História da Fotografia (Documentary)\n1987 - Relação Fiel e Verdadeira\n1988 - Flores Amargas\n1991 - Daisy, um Filme para Fernando Pesso\n1992 - Rosa Negra\n1994 - A Luz Incerta\n1997 - As escolhidas (Documentary)\n1999 - O Anjo da Guarda\n2002 - Não me Cortes o Cabelo que Meu Pai me Penteou (Short)\n2005 - Adriana\n2007 - Sobre o Lado Esquerdo (Short)\n2007 - LuzLinar e o Louva-a-Deus (Documentary)\n2009 - Fátima de A a Z (Documentary)\n2010 - Perdida Mente\n2010 - Conversas no Cabeleireiro, (with Solveig Nordlund)\n2012 - O Fantasma do Novais\n2012 - Paixão\n2012 - A Esquina do Tempo (Short)\n2017 - A que chamas pensar?\n2018 - Mar\n2024 - Mãos no Fogo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nTrailers of some of Gil's films",

        "content": "Therlo Moosa (born 16 June 1994) is a South African soccer player who plays as a striker for Cape Town Spurs in the Premier Soccer League.\nHe was born in Mitchell's Plain, growing up in the neighborhood Lentegeur. As a teenager, Moosa played for clubs like Oval North High School and Morgenster United as well as Western Cape in the inter-provincial tournament. Moosa then joined Mamelodi Sundowns in his late teens. He spent time on loan with Vasco da Gama, but was not given any playing time, and never played for Sundowns' first team either. In 2015 he moved on to Hellenic.\nPlaying for Magic in the third tier, he was an extremely prolific goalscorer in the league. In 2021-22 Moosa scored 19 goals in the Second Division for Glendene United. He was given a chance at the title contenders in the First Division, Cape Town Spurs. Moosa's 11 goals in the 2022-23 National First Division contributed to Cape Town Spurs' promotion to the highest league. Moosa finally made his first-tier debut in the 2023-24 South African Premier Division.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marek Dyduch (born August 27, 1957 in Świdnica) is a Polish politician who served as a Member of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland in the II, III, IV, and IX terms. He was also the Secretary of State at the Ministry of State Treasury from 2001 to 2002 and the general secretary of the SLD from 2002 to 2005.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1991, he graduated in law from the Faculty of Law and Administration at the University of Wrocław. He completed postgraduate studies in management and marketing at the Higher School of Management and Entrepreneurship in Wałbrzych (1997) and in real estate valuation at the Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences (2007). In the 1980s, he joined the Polish United Workers' Party. From 1986 to 1991, he served as the chairman of the provincial board of the Polish United Workers' Party in Wałbrzych. From 1990, he was active in the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, and in 1999, he joined the Democratic Left Alliance.\nFrom 1993 to 2005, he served as a member of the Sejm for the II, III, and IV terms representing the SLD, elected in the Wałbrzych constituencies: district No. 48 and No. 2. Additionally, from 1998 to 2000, he held the position of a councilor in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship Sejmik and led the SLD councilors' club. In 2005, he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate seat from district No. 2. From 2001 to 2002, he served as the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Treasury in Leszek Miller's government. On February 23, 2002, he was elected Secretary-General of the SLD (he was re-elected to this position in 2003 and 2004), at which point he resigned from the position of Deputy Minister. On May 29, 2005, he resigned from the position of Secretary-General. After leaving parliament, he engaged in his own business activities.\nIn 2006, he was elected as a councilor of the Lower Silesian Regional Assembly representing the coalition of the Left and Democrats. In September 2007, he left the SLD after not being placed on the LiD's candidate list for parliament. In March 2008, he co-founded a separate group of councilors for the Polish People's Party in the regional assembly. In January 2010, he returned to the SLD, and the following month, he left the PSL group in the regional assembly. That same year, he was again elected as a regional councilor and assumed the position of chairman of the SLD-PSL councilors' club. In 2011, he unsuccessfully ran for a parliamentary seat. In 2014, he retained his seat in the regional assembly for another term. In 2015, he ran for parliament again as the leader of the Wałbrzych electoral list of the United Left (this coalition did not exceed the electoral threshold). In 2018, he unsuccessfully ran for re-election in the regional assembly.\nIn January 2019, the Mayor of Wrocław, Jacek Sutryk, appointed him as his social advisor for the development of the Wrocław agglomeration. In the parliamentary elections of the same year, Marek Dyduch again obtained a parliamentary seat representing the SLD. In the 9th term of the Sejm, he became the deputy chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry. In October 2021, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the New Left, formed from the transformation of the SLD. In 2023, he unsuccessfully ran for re-election to parliament. In 2024, he once again ran in the regional assembly elections.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Yin decided to establish a news magazine to address Taiwan's international information deficit. The magazine primarily focuses on finance, with additional coverage of politics, humanities, and environmental protection. It is well known for its annual ranking of the top 2000 Taiwanese enterprises. CommonWealth has generally been regarded as politically neutral, although occasional criticism has emerged regarding a perceived leaning towards the pan-blue coalition in recent years.In 1986, Yin Yu-peng and Charles Kao had different visions for the company. Yu aimed to concentrate on domestic issues in Taiwan, while Kao intended to expand into the Chinese market. As a result, CommonWealth was divided into three divisions: CommonWealth Magazine, chaired by Yu; Global Views - Commonwealth Publishing Group, led by Kao; and Global Views Monthly, with Wang Lixing as the chief editor. In 2021, on the 40th anniversary of CommonWealth, Yu announced his retirement and appointed six executives, including Wu Yin-Chuen, the current president of the company, to co-lead the organization. The magazine has also received several Golden Tripod awards, including Best Digital Publication and Best Financial and Current Affairs Magazine in the 42nd and 45th Golden Tripods.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Chinese)",

        "content": "Naminapu \"Nami\" Maymuru-White (born 1952) is a senior Yolŋu artist of North East Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia. She is known for representing her the songlines of her clan, the Maŋgalili group, especially the stars and their reflections in the local rivers. She has been invited to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in July 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNaminapu Maymuru-White was born in 1952 at Djarrakpi in North East Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, into the Maŋgalili clan of Yolŋu people (an Aboriginal Australian people of northern Australia). Mentored by her father Nänyin Maymuru (1918–1969) and his Narritjin Maymuru (1922–1982), both senior Maŋgalili artists lawmen, she was one of the first Yolŋu women to be taught to paint miny'tji (sacred clan designs).\nShe attended the Yirrkala mission school, afterwards working in the mission store and craft shop and at the local bank. \nShe became known as \"Nami\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nMaymuru-White moved with her family (husband and young children) to the homeland of Gurka'wuy after its establishment in 1973. There she worked as a teacher trainee, and afterwards trained as a teacher in Yirrkala.  \nMaymuru-White lived in Melbourne and Darwin for some time with her second husband. In 1985 she returned to live at Yirrkala, now a self-governed Indigenous community, with her family, and started teaching art at the local school.\nShe then began working at the craft shop attached to Buku-Larrŋgay Arts, and in 1990 was appointed curator of the newly-established art museum attached to the centre. She remained in this position until 1996.\n\n\n== Art practice ==\nAs well as painting, Maymuru-White is skilled in carving, screen-printing, weaving, linocut, and batik.\nHer earlier work consisted mainly of miny'tyi, but Maymuru-White developed her own original designs that also relate to her clan identity. Maymuru-White is especially known for her work illustrating the Yolŋu concept of Milŋiyawuy, an epic songline that connects terrestrial and spiritual themes. She paints on bark, larrakitj (memorial poles), and canvas, using a traditional fine brush made of human hair tied to a wooden skewer, called the marwat.\nThe Milŋiyawuy songline relates the story of two ancestral spirits known as Guwak who travelled from the Maŋgalili homeland (200 km (120 mi) south of Yirrkala, down the Milŋiya River. Upon reaching the mouth, their vessel capsized, and their spirits were transformed into stars, known to non-Indigenous people as the Milky Way.\nHer Milky Way paintings are created using black and white stone and clay pigments, and comprise streams of stars. The connection between the earthly, space, and spiritual elements  reflects the Maŋgalili view that there is no separation between them. It is meant to represent a journey after death to a place where people can feel comforted.\nShe sees an important part of her work as teaching young people their culture.\nMaymuru-White has travelled around Australia as well as to Japan for her work, but now lives and works in Yirrkala.\n\n\n== Recognition and awards ==\n1996: Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award for \"Best Work on Paper\", for Nyapilingu\n1998: Joint runner-up, National Indigenous Heritage Art Award, Normandy Art Award, for her bark Maŋgalili\n2005: Wandjuk Marika 3D Memorial Award, for a Milŋiyawuy memorial poles\n\n\n== Exhibitions and collections ==\nMaymuru-White's work has often been included in group exhibitions both in Australia and internationally, and is represented in most Australian major institutional collections as well as several overseas ones.\n\n\n=== Selected exhibitions ===\nHer work was exhibited along with that of Bandak Marika, another woman artist from Yirrkala, at Warrnambool and Sydney in 1990.\nIn  2019 and 2020, the solo exhibitions, River of Stars at Salon Art Projects, Darwin, and Approximately Infinite Universe at The Cross Arts Projects in Sydney, sold out.\nIn February/March 2022 an exhibition of her work entitled Milŋiyawuy—The River of Heaven and Earth, was exhibited at  Sullivan+Strumpf, a commercial gallery in Melbourne with whom she had established a business relationship.\nIn March 2024, Art Basel Hong Kong exhibited installations by Maymuru-White and Sydney Aboriginal/Pacific Islander artist Daniel Boyd.\nMaymuru-White was invited to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in July 2024, as part of the first ever Indigenous Australian-led delegation. Along with several of her canvases, the work of Wadawurrung artist Marlene Gilson and Kamilaroi and Bigambul artist Archie Moore will be exhibited at the Biennale. Maymuru-White was not at first keen on making the trip, but her 24-year-old grandson, musical artist and arts worker Ngalakan (Billy) Wanambi, encouraged her and will travel with her and give a welcome yidaki performance at the event.\n\n\n=== Selected collections ===\nCollections and galleries holding Maymuru-White's work include:\n\nFondation Opale in Switzerland\nKerry Stokes Collection (larrakitj)\nKluge-Ruhe Museum, University of Virginia, US\nNational Gallery of Victoria\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMaymuru-White has three children by her first husband.\nShe later married Leon White, who was teaching in the Northern Territory, and lived in Melbourne and Darwin for several years before returning to Yirrkala in 1985.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Senor Buscador (foaled May 6, 2018) is an American thoroughbred racehorse most famous for winning the Saudi Cup. He has competed at 13 different racetracks starting with Remington Park in Oklahoma and going as far as Saudi Arabia and Dubai. His name is an homage to his lineage as it roughly translates to Mr. Prospector.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSenor Buscador is sired by 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft. A successful racehorse and stallion who's dam Prospectors Delite was sired by Mr.Prospector whom Senor Buscador gets his name. His dam is Rose's Desert a New Mexico bred who won 10 of 15 races primarily against other New Mexico breds although her career was cut short due to ankle problems. She was bred and owned by Joe Peacock Sr and was the first of Peacock's horses to be trained by Todd Fincher. Joe Peacock Sr had also bred and owned Rose's Desert's dam Miss Glen Rose who was one of the first horses he bred. He acquired her dam Snippet from a dispersal sale for $9,500 and the third horse he bred from the mare was Miss Glen Rose. Making Senor Buscador a third-generation homebred for the Peacock family. all 5 horses Rose's Desert produced were bred by Joe Peacock Sr and trained by Todd Fincher.Joe Peacock Sr started his career owning Quarter Horses in the 1960s but started breeding Thoroughbreds in 1997. Todd Fincher was once a Quarter horse jockey winning races such as the Ruidoso Futurity before conflicts with weight forced him to switch to being a horse trainer.They had found success in her previous foals with the highlights being Sheriff Brown and Runaway Ghost both stakes winners in New Mexico who earned more than half a million dollars each. Runaway Ghost being their first thoroughbred to win a graded stakes when he took the G3 Sunland Derby.  Senor Buscador was the final horse bred by Joe Peacock Sr before he passed away at the age of 88, He bred the horse along with his son Joe Peacock Jr.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== Two-year-old season ===\nBoth of Senor Buscador's two starts as a two-year-old were run at Remington Park. Their original plan had been to run him at Sunland Park where Todd Fincher and the Peacock family were based but due to the COVID pandemic Sunland Park was closed. So they shipped him to Remington Park where his very first start came on November 6, 2020. They wanted to run him longer but they were forced to settle for a 5 1/2 furlong Maiden Special Weight.\nHe had a slow beginning at one point being 10 lengths behind the leading horse but he would go on to win the race by 2 1/2 lengths. This would be the first time he'd show off his trademark strategy of detaching himself from the rest of the field and closing late to try and pass everyone.\nOnly one month later and he would end his two-year-old-year unbeaten with a stakes victory in the Remington Springboard Mile in another last to first performance but this time from even further back being 12 1/4 lengths behind at the start but crossing the finish line 5 3/4 lengths clear of his nearest opponent. The race would've awarded 10 Kentucky Derby points to the winner however, Senor Buscador did not earn points for the race because he was on Lasix.\n\n\n=== Three-year-old season ===\nAfter winning the Springboard Mile the plan was to take him down to The Fairgrounds as a 3-year-old and run him lasix-free to get him into the Kentucky Derby. But in the Risen Star Stakes he was sent wide throughout and couldn't muster the same late kick that got him first in his previous two races and he finished fifth just out of range to acquire Kentucky Derby points. His next race was going to be the Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park but his 3-year-old campaign was cut short by a suspensory injury to his right front leg. This would take him out of the Kentucky Derby so he was rested for what was expected to be a summer campaign. He was almost ready to return to racing but he injured himself again, this time injuring his hock in a stall accident making it so he could barely walk for several months. These injuries kept him off the racetrack for 15 months before finally returning in an allowance race at Lone Star Park on July 3, 2021, as a 4-year-old.\n\n\n=== Four-year-old season ===\nDespite a long layoff, he won his first race back at Lone Star Park starting in fifth but only getting stronger throughout to win by 2 lengths. Later that same month he travelled to Del Mar racetrack for the San Diego Handicap. He started slowly and never threatened finishing eighth in a nine-horse field and finishing 9 3/4 lengths behind the winner Royal Ship. He improved in his next start the Pat O'Brien but was strung 7 wide into the far turn and was a distant third place. His third start would be at Churchill Downs for the Ack Ack Stakes. He was able to come from behind on a very fast early pace being sixth early on but making ground on the outside and being second at the top of the stretch. There he faced a serious challenge from Injunction to his inside but he was able to successfully hold him off to win by 1 1/4 lengths. This was his first graded stakes victory and put him on equal footing with his older half brother Runaway Ghost.  It was the second graded stakes victory for Joe Peacock Sr and trainer Todd Fincher.\nTheir final race of the year would be his Grade 1 debut in the Breeders Cup Dirt Mile. The Ack Ack stakes is a part of the Breeders Cup Challenge series giving Senor Buscador an automatic paid birth into the race. He broke the slowest of the 9 contenders and stayed wide and near the back of the pack the whole way and finished eighth 13 1/2 lengths behind Cody's Wish.\n\n\n=== Five-year-old season ===\nWith no injuries, his 5-year-old season would be his first full campaign. It began at Sunland Park in the Curibot Handicap where he was the overwhelming favorite at odds of 1–9. The distant second choice was his holder half-brother Sheriff Brown who was also coming off a win two starts back and an underwhelming effort on Breeders Cup day.  Senor Buscador was unhurried early on only being ahead of Sheriff Brown in the first quarter of a mile. Senor Buscador preferred a fast pace to close into but in the Curibot Handicap Limonite took the lead immediately and made a very slow pace. Running the first quarter in 25.52 and the half in 49.67. Despite this Senor Buscador caught up to him at the top of the stretch and hooked up briefly before pulling away to win by four lengths.His next two races were the Oaklawn Handicap, and the Hollywood Gold Cup with both having similar results. He was pinched out at the start forcing him to trail the field early on. By the time he caught up he was forced to go wide into the far turn and flattened out. Finishing fourth in the Oaklawn Handicap and fifth in the Hollywood Gold Cup.\nTwo months later he tried for a second time to win the San Diego Handicap. He dropped as far back as 11 1/2 lengths behind the leaders early and benefited greatly from a fast pace set by Brickyard Ride a sprinter who was attempting to stretch out in distance. When Brickyard Ride faded Slow Down Andy took the lead for a brief moment but Senor Buscador was travelling the best and flew past all of them to win by 1 1/4 in his second graded stakes victory and his first Grade 2. One month later and he was back at Del Mar to run in the Pacific Classic where he trailed as usual and was given a fast pace to close into by Arabian Knight but he went six wide into the far turn and only rallied fast enough to finish fourth. He did one better in the Awesome Again getting his first grade 1 showing when he navigated in and out of horses on a sloppy racetrack. This would be his final prep before he raced in the Breeders Cup Classic his second participation in a Breeders Cup race. The best he could do was seventh place.\nHis final start of the year would be the Cigar Mile at Aqueduct Racetrack making it his 10th racetrack in 16 starts. It was the first time since his win in the Ack Ack Stakes that he was going to run a one-turn race. It resulted in a second-place finish, despite going wider than he had ever before going eight wide in this race he was unable to catch the runaway leader Hoist The Gold who had opened up five lengths at the top of the stretch and Senor Buscador was unable to reach him.\n\n\n=== Six-year-old season ===\nSenor Buscador arrived early for the 2024 Pegasus World Cup in order to be better prepared. While his connections were confident that he could run well there was some concern on if he could make enough ground at Gulfstream Park a racetrack that has a reputation for favouring speed horses and not closers. Despite this Senor Buscador was able to rally from 12 1/2 lengths off the pace while staying on the rail until the top of the stretch saving ground that he usually lost thanks to his need to avoid traffic to make his best run late. He past the exhausted Hoist The Gold to take second but when he went up to challenge the leader National Treasure. he was held off in deep stretch by only a neck. It was considered one of his best performances of his career and shortly after the race he was given an invitation to the 2024 Saudi Cup the richest horse race in the worldThe Friday before the Saudi Cup a minority interest lease was bought into the horse by Sharaf Mohammed S. Al-Hariri that was intended to last through the horses time in the Middle East and only included the earnings he acquired during his time racing and did not include breeding rights On raceday he was considered an outsider at 13-1 with the 6-5 favorite being another American horse White Abarrio who had defeated Senor Buscador by 5 1/4 lengths in the Breeders Cup Classic. Other horses had finished ahead of Senor Buscador that were back for Saudi Cup included 2023 Dubai World Cup winner Ushba Tesoro, 2023 UAE Derby winner Derma Sotogake, and the horse who beat him in his previous start National Treasure. Senor Buscador as expected started the race in last place.\nThe race was under a very fast pace by Saudi Crown and National Treasure who stalked in second place. With 300 yards to go Senor Buscador still had most of the field to pass. He and Ushba Tesoro were both flying from the back of the pack but Ushba Tesoro was ahead of Senor Buscador. With 50 yards to go Senor Buscador was fourth and Ushba Tesoro was second with Saudi Crown still in front. Ushba Tesoro would quickly surge past Saudi Crown and take the lead for a brief moment but to his outside was Senor Buscador who was now traveling the fastest. In the final strides Senor Buscador had his head in front right on the finish line winning the Saudi Cup by the smallest margin in the races history. It was also the fastest Saudi Cup ever run setting a new stakes record time of 1:49.50.It was the first Grade 1 win for the horse, trainer, and owner as well as their first victory outside of America. Trainer Fincher was quoted after the race saying \"I'm about to cry, It's amazing. He's never got the credit he deserves, I'm so proud of the horse. I didn't believe, something always happens to him. He always runs good and hard. We knew he'd run good, we had to hope for the right set-up and we got it.”His next race would be the Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse with hopes of becoming the first horse to win both the Saudi Cup and Dubai World Cup the first and second richest dirt races in the world. He would have a rematch with Ushba Tesoro who had won the race the previous year. But the race was stolen on the lead by a local horse named Laurel River who was able to run the race at his own pace and only got further and further away from the pack until it was impossible to catch him at the top the stretch. At the wire, he won the race by 8 1/2 lengths with Ushba Tesoro passing Senor Buscador on the outside to claim a distant second-place finish while Senor Buscador finished third. Finishing no worse than third in three multimillion-dollar horse races in two months.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\nSenor Buscador is inbred 3x4 to Mr. Prospector as well as 4x5 to Blushing Groom, meaning both horses' names appear twice on a five generation pedigree.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Calvin Alexander Ramsey Sr. is an American playwright and author, mostly known for writing a play called The Green Book which was later written into a popular children's book called Ruth and The Green Book. Ramsey was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and produced his first play, The Green Book in 2001. He later wrote Ruth and The Green Book based on the play in 2010. Currently, Ramsey works as a playwright and author living between his two homes, in New York City and Atalanta, Georgia.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Plays ===\n\n\n==== The Green Book ====\nRamsey's first play The Green Book was written in 2001. It was a two-act play about the struggles of African American travellers in the Jim Crowe era based on The Negro Motorist Green Book. The play had its world premiere at Atlanta's Theatrical Outfit. It received recognition as a finalist in the 12th Annual Last Frontier Theatre Conference in Valdez, Alaska in June 2004. \nAfter its first release, it had subsequent readings at La MaMa E.T.C. in New York's Village, directed by George Ferencz where it received positive reviews. He picked up on the idea of the Green Book when he heard about it at the funeral of a close friend's son in 2001. The Green Book project now includes a documentary with animation, The Green Book Chronicles. He later went on to write a children's book entitled Ruth and The Green Book in 2010. \nIn 2011, Ruth and The Green Book won Independent Publisher Book Award in the Children's Picture Book category. and Jane Addams Children's Book Award in the book for younger children category.\n\n\n==== Sherman Town: Baseball, Apple Pie and the Ku Klux Klan ====\nSet for the first reading in 2005, the play was switched to a different theatre from the initial one in Stone Mountain as it was challenged over the language that was used in it. This gained the play national attention over issues of censorship. The play was about an out of town salesman that gets stuck in the small town of Shermantown during the annual KKK rally.\nOther plays Ramsey has written are Sister Soldier, Damaged Virtues, John Brown, \"Canada Lee\", and Englightenment.\n\n\n=== Musicals ===\n\n\n==== Bricktop, The Musical ====\nThis was a musical based on Ada 'Bricktop' Smith from Chez Bricktop in Paris. It was co-written by Tom Jones and was opened in 2006. It had a successful first run of 9 weeks and subsequent run of five weeks. \nOther musicals Ramsey has written are Somewhere in My Lifetime, The Age of Possibilities, Jhonny Mercer, Kentucky Avenue, Belle, the Last Mule, Ruth and The Green Book, Duke Ellington: A Man for All Seasons.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "H. Rüetschi is one of the last and oldest Bell foundries in Switzerland. It is located in the city of Aarau, which is why it is also called the \"bell city\" is mentioned. Aarau bells can be found in many church towers in Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\nBells have been cast in Aarau since 1367. In the beginning, the foundry was run by a Reber family. Various other genders followed later. In 1607, Hans-Jakob Stalder had a smelting works built on the “Rain”, where the foundry still stands today. At the beginning of the 19th century, Johann-Heinrich Bär sold the foundry to his two employees Sebastian Rüetschi and Jakob Rüetschi (1838–1748). In 1824 they acquired the property on the “Rain” with all accessories for 18,000 Swiss francs.\nAfter Jakob Rüetschi's death, his son Emanuel Rüetschi took over the property and expanded it. He continued to run the company together with his brothers Daniel and Johann Jakob Rüetschi. Hermann Rüetschi, the only son of Johann Jakob Rüetschi, joined the company in 1876 after studying engineering in Lausanne and Munich; he acquired it in 1882. Since he remained childless, the “Rüetschi dynasty” died out with him in 1917. In order to preserve the name, the company was converted into a public limited company after the First World War.\nWith the introduction of Krupp steel guns, the last cannonballs were delivered in 1873. Friedrich Wilhelm Schilling expanded his knowledge here.\n\n\n== Business areas ==\nIn addition to casting church bells and other large bells, Rüetschi is also involved in other casting applications:\n\nCasting of small bells such as house and ship bells, souvenir, decorative, and herd bells\nCasting of works of art, mainly bronze sculptures\nCasting objects for landscape architect.\nTechnical casting in Bronze, Brass, Aluminum and special alloys for various industrial and technical applications.\nIn addition, the company offers know-how relating to the installation of large bells: project planning, vibration isolation in bell towers, acoustics and sound analyses, electrical installation and ringing machines, steel construction for the Bell chair construction, yokes, clapper and iron fittings. Turret clocks are often associated with church bells. By taking over the Mäder tower clock factory, repairs and maintenance of tower and facade clocks can be offered. In addition, rooms at the Rüetschi bell foundry are also made available to other service companies.\n\n\n== Examples of cast bells ==\n\n\n== Web links ==\n\nWebsite of the Rüetschi bell foundry\nSwiss film newsreel from September 1, 1950, The New Bells\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Power Behind the Throne is a supplement published by Games Workshop in 1988 as the fourth installment of The Enemy Within Campaign created for the fantasy role-playing game Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. \n\n\n== Description ==\nPower Behind the Throne is the fourth part of The Enemy Within campaign, and picks up where the previous supplement, Death on the Reik, ends. The player characters arrive in the city of Middenheim at the onset of carnival week, but quickly find that new and onerous taxes are alienating large sections of the population. The characters must interact with a large number of non-player characters in order to uncover the web of plots that threaten to bury the city.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe six-part campaign The Enemy Within, designed for the fantasy role-playing game Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, was published between 1986 and 1989. The fourth installment, Power Behind the Throne, was a 112-page hardcover book written by Carl Sargent, with cover art by The Edwards and interior art by John Blanche, Paul Bonner, Charles Elliott, Tony Hough, Martin McKenna, and Russ Nicholson. It was released in 1988 as a 112-page hardcover book that also contained a pullout map of Middenheim.\nCreator Carl Sargent created so many notes about the city of Middenheim that these were gathered together and published as a separate sourcebook, Warhammer City.\nIn 1995, Hogshead Publishing acquired the license to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and published an updated version of the series as six hardcover books. There had been some criticism that there was too great a time interval between Death on the Reik and Power Behind the Throne, so Hogshead added a short scenario created by James Wallis titled Carrion Up the Reik, to provide a link between the two adventures.\nIn 2017, Cubicle 7 acquired the license for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, and in 2019, began publishing a Director's Cut of the campaign for the fourth edition of the game, including a new edition of Power Behind the Throne,  which was accompanied by a separate companion volume with additional bonus material.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the April 1990 edition of Dragon (Issue 156), Ken Rolston called this \"an exceptional example of the diplomatic style of fantasy role-play gaming (a style singularly suited for sophisticated urban adventuring) with complex plotting, impenetrable intrigues, and cleverly drawn NPC characterizations.\" Rolston did point out \"the link between the previous adventure in the series, Death on the Reik, and Power Behind the Throne, and the pretext for the PCs becoming involved in Middenheim's webs of intrigue are a bit thin.\" \nIn Issue 9 of the British magazine The Games Machine, John Woods noted \"the book contains an appropriate array of attractions to amuse and divert players. A city map is included and, most importantly, details of a large number of non-player characters, interaction with which forms the backbone of the adventure.\" Woods concluded that this adventure was \"An unusual scenario with a greater need for referee and player skill than its predecessors - should be a lot of fun.\"\nIn Issue 10 of Warpstone, John Foody reviewed the Hogshead edition of Power Behind the Throne and commented that \"the scenario may be excellent in theory, but in practice can be difficult both to run and play. Indeed, even its greatest supporters agree that gamemasters need to be experienced before attempting to run it.\" Foody also found the cover art was misleading, and the quality of the interior art was \"variable.\" Foody liked the mini-scenario that linked the previous adventure, writing, \"Although little more than a small series of encounters, the roleplaying aspects of the scenario are strong, as is the atmosphere.\" Foody noted the many possible encounters with non-player characters, and suggested, \"Inexperienced GMs, or those who have players who are not used to taking the initiative, may well struggle. There are few trigger events to push the PCs or the plot along. The GM is required to be fully confident with the adventure, especially the motivations and goals of the numerous NPCs, juggling them all as PCs criss-cross the city from one meeting to another. There is a danger that those who are ill-prepared may end up umming and ahhing far too much for comfort.\" Foody also pointed out that there was no description of what would happen should the characters fail to foil the evil plot, calling this \"an important omission.\" Despite all these shortcomings, Foody concluded by called this \"an excellent adventure, [although it] is not the best scenario that The Enemy Within has to offer ... It is atmospheric, and I would say the best example I have seen of what a city based scenario should be. It makes a worthy addition to the Enemy Within Campaign, especially with the inclusion of the Carrion up the Reik scenario.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nEnvoyer\nShadis #52 (Oct., 1998)\n\n\n== References ==",

He is currently the creative director of the brand Helmut Lang.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDo was born in Biên Hòa, Vietnam, and moved to Philadelphia at age 14. \n\n\n== Career ==\nDo attended the Fashion Institute of Technology, and graduated in 2014, winning the LVMH Graduate Prize.  Afterwards, he worked at Celine and then Derek Lam, before starting his own label in 2018.Do became the creative director of Helmut Lang in 2023, releasing his first collection during the Autumn New York Fashion Week.  The collection received mixed reviews. In a review for  The Cut, Cathy Horyn describing it as \"devoid of meaning\", and compared the collection to Helmut Lang's sister company, Uniqlo. In a review for the New York Times, Vanessa Friedman said that the collection was \"accomplished, accessible, and very commercial\", but that it was missing the \"subversion\" found in the collections made when  Helmut Lang was creative director.  In a review for Washington Post, Rachel Tashjian said that his debut \"stole the show\", and that the collection was \"raw [...] and precise\".Peter Do frequently wears a cloth face mask. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Photoferroelectric imaging is the process of storing an image onto a piece of ferroelectric material by the aid of an applied electric pulse.\nStored images are nonvolatile and selectively erasable. Photoferroelectric image storage devices have the advantage of being \"extremely simple and easy to fabricate\". \nPhotoferroelectric imaging uses a ferroelectric material's photosensitivity in conjunction with its ferroelectric properties. One type of medium which has been used for photoferroelectric imaging is lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics, which exhibit a good combination of properties for imaging: large electro-optic coefficients, high intrinsic and extrinsic photosensitivities, and nonvolatile memory.\n\n\n== Process ==\nA description of a photoferroelectric imaging process (using PLZT material) is given in the McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. In that process, a thin flat plate of transparent, optically polished PLZT material (around 0.25mm thick) was sputter-coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) on both sides, serving as electrodes. Then, the image was exposed onto one of the ITO surfaces, while a voltage pulse was simultaneously applied across the electrodes. The ferroelectric polarization thereby switched from one remanent state to another, and images were \"stored both as spatial distributions of light-scattering centers in the bulk of the PLZT and as surface deformation strains which form a relief pattern of the image on the exposed surface.\" The image may then be viewed directly or indirectly.\nThis photoferroelectric effect is a type of electro-optic effect. In the example process, the ceramic was poled to a saturation remanent polarization state by the light (charge carriers were photoexcited across the PLZT's bandgap). The polarization was then switched by the application of the electric field - a phenomenon called photoassisted domain switching.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nPhotoferroelectric imaging may be useful in temporary image storage and display. It also has potential applications in data storage and holographic recording.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhotorefractive effect\nElectro–optic effect",

This faction was created in 2015, with the Cártel del Noreste and Los Metros as its main enemies. Los Ciclones had as their area of influence the border crossing between Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBeginning as an armed wing, they were created after a dispute between two of the main leaders of the CDG, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén and his brother, Antonio \"Tony Tormenta\", especially to confront Los Zetas founded by Osiel, they were formed by former members of the state police and the army, standing out for their extreme violence and the use of military tactics, becoming their personal guard. At the time of the separation with Los Zetas, Los Escorpiones took a more important role in the organization. On 5 November 2010, \"Tony Tormenta\", as well as four of his bodyguards, three sailors and a soldier engaged in a confrontation that lasted nearly eight hours, and involved 660 Marines, three helicopters and 17 vehicles, which left several \"narcoblockades\", suspension of classes in several educational institutions and closure of three international bridges that paralyzed the city. Two bodyguards who survived were Marcos Antonio Cortez Rodríguez, \"Escorpión 37\", (Tony Tormenta's trusted man and who was in charge of the armed wing), and Jesús González Rodríguez, \"Escorpión 43\".\nFor several years it was believed that the group had dissolved, but in 2015, a cell emerged in Matamoros and Tampico that initially called itself Grupo Escorpiones. These maintained their connections with the police, since their leader was Lázaro Martínez Rodríguez alias “El Escorpión” who was a ministerial police officer and chief of police in the city of Madero, until he was also murdered. It was not until years later that it was confirmed that the group was commanded by José Álfredo Cárdenas Mártineza \"El Contador\", Evaristo Cruz \"El Vaquero\" and Víctor Hugo \"El Chaparro. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Back Being Blue is a 2018 studio album by American country musician Kelly Willis, her first solo album of original material in over a decade. The release received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Back Being Blue received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 from six critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Mark Deming writing that \"Willis is just as breezy and delightful as ever\" and \"has as pure and satisfying a voice as anyone in American music, and her instrument is just as strong and pleasing as ever, with the faint Southern twang and subtle vibrato of her singing adding the ideal emotional punctuation to her performances\"; the editorial staff also chose this as one of their favorite country music albums off 2018. In American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz gave this release 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that it \"feels like a natural progression\" after having recorded multiple collaborative albums with husband Bruce Robison and \"it’s a pleasure to have her talent front and center and not sharing the spotlight\". Abby Johntson of The Austin Chronicle rated this album 3 out of 5 stars, stating that this \"collection of original songs and covers feels effortlessly of the moment\" and that it \"proves this overall tonality more relevant than ever, and three decades in – better than even modern – once again brands Kelly Willis as timeless\".\nJewly Hight of NPR's First Listen noted several music genres in the songs, from \"pillowy, R&B-glazed texture of country-pop in the disco era\" to \"loping, reflective folk-country\" and the author ended stating that \"Willis proves that she can have it both ways, and that's a source of pleasure for us listeners, too\". An 8.3 out of 10 came from Lee Zimmerman of Paste who praised the songwriting, backing musicians, and noted that the music \"may reflect a sadder state of mind, but there’s no denying that it still shines all the same\". PopMatters's Elisabeth Woronzoff rated Back Being Blue a 7 out of 10 for being a \"welcomed return to the music scene\" and states these songs show Willis \"musicality and empowered voice\" as they \"radiate and ultimately outweighs the album’s rough areas\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Kelly Willis, except where noted.\n\n\"Back Being Blue\" – 3:49\n\"Only You\" – 2:38\n\"Fool’s Paradise\" – 3:19\n\"Modern World\" – 2:27\n\"Freewheeling\" – 2:41\n\"Afternoon’s Gone Blind\" (Karl Straub) – 3:18\n\"What the Heart Doesn’t Know\" – 2:43\n\"I’m a Lover (Not a Fighter)\" (Ronnie Light) – 3:03\n\"We’ll Do It for Love Next Time\" (Rodney Crowell) – 3:13\n\"Don’t Step Away\" (Jeff Rymes and Randy Weeks) – 4:22\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKelly Willis – vocals\nGina R.

        "content": "Beautiful Lie is a 2019 studio album by American country musicians Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis. The work was the fourth of four recordings released by the couple and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting in American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz rated Beautiful Lie 3.5 out of 5 stars for being \"a well-balanced set both vocally and musically\", with \"friskier tunes to offset the lost/fading love slower tracks\". In The Austin Chronicle, Doug Freeman gave this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling the music \"some of their best genre work together\" and ending \"Austin's reigning country couple remain on a roll and are only getting better\". In No Depression, Matt Conner called this release \"part textbook and part songbook\" that \"tips more than a hat to tradition while it adds plenty more to the catalog\". Steve Horowitz of PopMatters rated this work an 8 out of 10, summing up, \"Beautiful Lie successfully captures the sound of the past, but as Robison demonstrates on his self-penned tunes, the past is more than a memory. It is part of who one is in the here and now. We learn from our experiences. Life may not be perfect, but it’s all that we have and deserves to be treasured.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"If I Had a Rose\" (Adam Wright) – 3:20\n\"Astrodome\" (Jack Ingram and Bruce Robison) – 4:24\n\"Nobody's Perfect\" (A.

        "content": "The Swedish-Tripolitanian War was a naval conflict that took place from 1796 to 1802 between Sweden and Tripolitania over Yusuf Karamanli taking advantage of Sweden to gain large amounts of tribute.\n\n\n== Background ==\nYusuf Karamanli aimed to maintain power by reorganizing the military, expanding the fleet, and pushing into the southern Sahara. Trouble arose when Sweden and Denmark were slow to send gifts to him. In response, he seized ships from both countries to pressure them. Despite new demands reaching Sweden in 1794, Yusuf Qaramanli insisted on renegotiating a peace treaty, ignoring objections from both Constantinople and Stockholm.Unlike his father, who had honored peace agreements with Sweden, Yusuf Qaramanli repeatedly declared war on Sweden and captured several ships.\n\n\n== War ==\nIn 1797, Major David Gustaf Blessingh left Sweden with the frigate Thetis and the brig of war Husaren to resolve the conflict.In June 1798, the Tripolitanians captured 20 ships and 160 Swedish sailors, Sweden started the negotiations. Sweden and Dannmark paid $100 000 for returning their captives.Thetis returned to Tripoli. The new 1798 treaty was unstable, and Yusuf Karamanli declared war on Sweden again in 1800. This time under Lieutenant-Colonel Carl Gustaf Tornquist, who negotiated a new peace treaty in early 1801 to free the hostages. The Swedes didn't ratify it due to Tripolitan demands.\nIn January 1801, the Swedish warship \"Thundera\" sailed into Tripoli Harbor with a white flag. During the conflict with Sweden, four merchant ships were seized and sold to Tunis, with their crews held as hostages by Karamanli.\n\n\n=== Blockade of Tripoli Harbor ===\n\nIn 1802, Swedish and American warships worked together to blockade Tripoli's port. They helped each other with convoys for their merchant ships, and a new peace treaty was signed. Sweden's Consul Burström reported that despite the treaty, the joint blockade didn't work because Tripoli's corsair galleys still accessed the port. Burström noted that the blockade's failure pleased Yusuf Karamanli.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn October of 1802, Sweden withdrew from the First Barbary War and paid a significant tribute to Tripolitania, while the Regency of Tripoli continued the war against the Americans before eventually signing peace with the United States in 1805.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "A patibular fork was a gallows that consisted of two or more columns of stone, with an horizontal beam of wood resting on top. Placed high and visible from the main public thoroughfare, it signalled the seat of high justice, the number of stone columns indicating the holder's title.\nThose condemned to death were hanged from the wooden beam, their bodies left on the gallows for passers-by to see and for corvus to devour.\nAlthough sometimes used in the singular, the term \"patibular forks\" is usually written in the plural.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nFrom the Latin patibulum (\"cross\", \"gallows\", \"pole\").\nThe origin of the term comes from the forks used by the Romans to punish slaves. After stripping the slaves of their clothes, the slaves' head was passed through a fork and their body was attached to the same piece of wood to be beaten with sticks.\nPatibular forks should not be confused with patibular ladders or patibular marks.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPatibular forks first appeared at the beginning of the 12th century. In Touraine, ecclesiastical records and documents attest to their presence since the 13th century. The most famous was that of the Provost of Paris: the Gibbet of Montfaucon, at the Porte de Paris (northeast of the city, near the present Place du Colonel-Fabien). The gallows had been installed under Philip the Fair at the instigation of his minister and advisor, Enguerrand de Marigny, who was himself hanged thereafter Philip the Fair's death.\n\nPatibular forks were generally placed on high ground outside cities, towns, and villages, usually near a main road and in a place where travellers could see them, to inspire the horror of the crime.\nDespite the macabre nature of these constructions and the foul smell they emitted, cabarets were often set up in the vicinity of the patibular forks, as hangings were a popular spectacle in the Middle Ages (remains of a cabaret in Creuë).\n\n\n=== Justice levels ===\nIn principle, high justiciars were required to have patibular forks \"both as a sign and token of their high justice and for the execution thereof\".\nBut an older treatise, the Grand Coutumier de France, states that \"many high justiciars do not have forks, but for this reason, the right of their justice cannot be weakened\" and even that \"those who have average justice have the power to hang without dragging, and can only have forks with two pillars whose links are dedicated\".\n\n\n=== Number of pillars ===\nOnly the king could have as many as he wished, and in principle, dukes had eight, counts six, barons four, chatelains three, and simple high justiciars two. There were, however, many exceptions to this general rule, and these varied, for example, according to the customary law of the various provinces and the history of each seigneury:\n\nIn 1496, Charles VIII allowed the \"dean and chappitre of the church of Angiers\", high justiciars in their seigneury of Plexis-au-Gramaire, to rebuild their four-pillared patibular forks there.\nIn 1696, when Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine made the land of the Garnerans a county, he allowed the Count to rebuild the four-pillared patibular forks.\nIn 1719, when he made Cons-la-Grandville a marquisate with high justice, the Duc de Bar granted him only four-pillar patibular forks.\nIn an edition of 1762, the Traité des fiefs sur la Coutume de Poitou (Treaty of Fiefs on the Coutume of Poitou) stipulates that counts, viscounts, or barons may have and hold four-pillar patibular forks.\nIn an attempt at a synthesis, the Traité des justices de seigneur et des droits en dépendants (Treaty of the Justices of the Lord and the Rights depending on them - 1764) mentions that \"most of the Coutume which mention the rights attributed to the Lord of a land erected into a County, give him the right to have a six-pillar patibular justice [...] although other Coutume decides that the Count's patibular justice should have only four pillars\". However, when the title of the seigniory evolves, the number of authorized pillars tends to remain unchanged: \"[...] Pillars; according to their titles and immemorial possession. And for this purpose, there is no need to innovate or research anything, but to leave things as they are, to avoid endless litigation\".\nThe High Justice must obtain the King's authorization to erect new patibular forks, or to rebuild them if they have been down or destroyed for more than a year and a day.\n\n\n== Principle ==\nAccording to the thesis of Anne Lafran, quoted by Cécile Voyer of the Centre d'études supérieures de civilisation médiévale (Center of Advanced Studies in Medieval Civilization), the hanging and the disembowelment (by corvus) recall the death of Judas.\nMatthew's Gospel evokes suicide by hanging, while Luke's evokes disembowelment. Both versions can be found in the literature of the twelfth century.\nAccording to the study of the Paris forks, the bodies of the tortured were removed as late as possible, even if this meant rehanging body parts that had fallen off. Indeed, forks lose their raison d'être as soon as they are no longer in use.\nAccording to Vincent Chalet of the Centre d'études médiévales de Montpellier (Montpellier Medieval Studies Center), on the one hand, patibular forks were used, perhaps not often, but in any case not merely symbolically; on the other hand, they were intended to punish outsiders (vagrants, adventurers, rivals, etc.), unlike pillories, which were intended to punish insiders.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nGibbet of Montfaucon\nPlourin (Finistère)\nChâteau de Kerjean (Finistère)\nGibet of Creuë\nThe Mount of Forks in Vitry-en-Perthois\n\n\n== See also ==\nHanging\nPillory\nCourt leet\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nViollet-le-Duc, Eugène (1861).

        "content": "\"Nurse Stimpy\" is the 4th episode of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show.  It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States 25 August, 1991.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen becomes deadly ill and Stimpy vows to take care of him. Stimpy dons a nurse's uniform and provides a variety of unpractical treatments that cause Ren much pain. At the end, Ren becomes cured while Stimpy becomes sick instead. Ren puts on the nurse uniform and says \"now ee't my turn!\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode had a troubled production with the script being rewritten five times. The storyboard work for Nurse Stimpy was done by Chris Reccardi while Bob Camp did the lay-out with the rest of the work being done by the Lacewood studio in Ottawa. John Kricfalusi who directed Nurse Stimpy disallowed his own work and used a pseudonym for the director's credit. In a 1993 interview, Kricfalusi said of Nurse Stimpy: \"It's really ugly cartoon\". The American critic Martin Goodman wrote the Ren & Stimpy Show explored fears of illness, decay and death as the show \"featured filth, illness, disease and mutilation to an unprecedented degree, making these horrors an integral part of the show\". \n\n\n== Reception ==\nNurse Stimpy is widely regarded as one of the weaker stories of the first season of The Ren & Stimpy Show with the American journalist Thad Komorowski writing that Nurse Stimpy is \"merely an exhibition of toilet humor\". \n\n\n== Books ==\nKlickstein, Matthew; Summers, Marc (2013).

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Howard Doyle Berry (born 1941) better known as \"Pigpen\" is a Canadian outlaw biker, criminal and gangster.\n\n\n== Entry into crime ==\nBerry was born in Peterborough into a Roman Catholic Irish family and had what was described as a \"horrific upbringing\" with both of his parents being severally verbally and physically abusive. His father abandoned his family when he son was five years old. Berry was raised by his mother and his sisters, all of whom had developed strongly misandrist tendencies because of abuse by his father. His mother told him he was a monster because he had a penis and forced to sleep in the basement of their house, adding for good measure that demons lived in the basement and would devour him alive. Berry recalled: \"I lived half the time in the basement on a dirt floor and a rubber sheet. I got scared that the bogeyman would get me. She [my mother] used to make me go to church all of the time. I used to piss the bed scared\". Believing himself to be the hideous monster that his mother told him that he was, Berry was full of rage against the world and he took up boxing as his principle hobby as a teenager in the 1950s. Standing 6 feet tall and weighting about 245 pounds, Berry became an accomplished amateur boxer at the Peterborough Boxing Club and the East City Bowl Boxing Club. As boxing and organized crime are closely linked in Canada, Berry's skills as a boxer soon led him into the outlaw biker clubs in the early 1960s. He attracted much attention with a street fight against George Clark of the Vagabonds biker gang that led to the police blocking off Avenue Road for an hour while taking bets about who would win. Berry worked as a chef at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and as a Buddy Holly impersonator.\n\n\n== Satan's Choice ==\nBerry was a founding member of Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club in 1965 and made his reputation with a celebrated street fight in Toronto against Howard \"Baldy\" Chard, the former boxing champion in Kingston Penitentiary and the principle enforcer for the gangster Johnny Papalia. Berry dropped out of university and became the main enforcer of Satan's Choice.  The purpose of Satan's Choice was to oppose the respectable values of Canadian society by engaging in anti-social behavior and the more shocking the act, the better from the viewpoint of Satan's Choice. Berry became the most infamous member of Satan's Choice, known for his antics such as bringing his feces to a dinner table and then eating it. Berry was regarded as a wildman who engaged in such disgusting antics such as vomiting over new members of Satan's Choice, eating live birds and mice, and attaching a dead skunk he found on the road to his biker's vest. The American journalist Nick Lowe wrote that Berry was \"far and away the filthiest, foulest member the Satan's Choice ever had\". Under the influence of drugs, Berry became very paranoid to the extent that he pulled out his own teeth because he believed the police had bugged his teeth. The Satan's Choice national president, Bernie Guindon, stated in an interview that Berry was a disgusting and repulsive man, but that he had his uses as an enforcer as Berry was willing to do quite literally anything for Satan's Choice.  However, Berry was felt to be most dangerous when he cleaned up his appearance because as he stated: \"Nobody would recognize me. Then I went to the dark side of town\". Cecil Kirby stated about Berry: \"There are guys who would start fights and then they'd say 'Come and help me'. I can't stand people like that. Be a stand-up guy. He was a stand-up guy. That's what I liked about him\".\nIn 1970, the biker exploitation film Hells Angels 69 was released staring Sonny Barger and the other members of the Hells Angels Oakland chapter as themselves. Inspired by the box office success of Hells Angels 69, the film producer George Fras decided to shoot a low budget biker exploitation film, The Proud Rider, in the Toronto area starring Art Hindle and with members of the Oshawa and Toronto chapters of Satan's Choice playing themselves. The production of The Proud Rider was a troubled one as on the first day of shooting, 3 October 1970, the Toronto police arrested a Satan's Choice biker on the set. Berry who played himself in The Proud Rider was a disruptive presence on the set who refused to take direction and constantly engaged in bizarre antics designed to shock and appall the film crew and actors. When the other members of Satan's Choice dropped their pants and underwear out of hope of shocking a script girl, Berry felt upstaged so he bit off the head of a live garter snake out of the hopes he could shock the script girl even more. Berry disregarded the rules on wearing safety helmets when riding his motorcycles and filmed all of his riding scenes without a helmet.  When The Proud Rider was released in 1971, it was a hit in Toronto as audiences flocked to see a film set in and filmed in Toronto and Oshawa, but a box office bomb everywhere else with critics condemning the acting as atrociously bad and the plot as a \"ramshackle melodrama\".     \nIn 1974, the Montreal chapter of Satan's Choice became involved in a biker war with the Popeye Moto Club. Berry was called upon to assist. Kirby recalled in a 2015 interview: \"If there was trouble anywhere, they'd sent Howard Berry out to take care of it. He was the Choice hitman and everybody knew it\". Kirby was present when\" Berry opened fire on the clubhouse of the Popeyes with a sawed-off Lee–Enfield .303 rifle with a ten-round clip, saying \"It was like a cannon going off\". In a 2015 interview, Berry stated that he was hired to kill people, but never actually succeeded in doing so, saying he was a poor hitman and denied Kirby's claims that he had killed several people. Berry often worked with Ken Goobie to perform violent acts in what Berry called the \"dark side of town\".\nIn 1975 to escape charges of attempted murder in Canada, Berry moved to Florida where he was taken in by the Hollywood, Florida, chapter of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club. In Florida, Berry was given the alias \"Peter Ray Johnson\" and assisted the Outlaws in various criminal activities. Berry worked as a car thief for the Outlaws along with stealing yachts on their trailers. Berry reported to Bernie Guindon, the president of Satan's Choice: \"Down there they played the game for keeps...They're well organized. They made money big time\". Berry became involved in the biker war between the Outlaws and the Hells Angels and was shot twice in the chest by the Hells Angels in a failed murder attempt. Guindon stated of Berry's time in Florida: \"They [the Outlaws] didn't like him at all. He was getting away with it up here. Down there, I don't think they took much to him. They couldn't stand his fucking bullshit. They thought he was totally crazy\". Despite the dislike of Berry by the Outlaws, his presence in Florida expanded the alliance between the Outlaws and Satan's Choice as he played a crucial role in forging the alliance. Starting in the early 1970s, Satan's Choice members operated drug labs in cabins in northern Ontario, with production focusing especially on PCP and methamphetamines, better known in the area as \"Canadian Blue\". Under the terms of the alliance, the Outlaws served as the exclusive distributors in the United States of the PCPs and methamphetamine manufactured by Satan's Choice in northern Ontario. The \"Canadian Blue\" methamphetamine produced in Ontario sold for $8,000 Canadian dollars per pound, but in the United States it sold for $12,000 U.S. dollars per pound. The drug network for selling the PCP went from northern Ontario down to Florida, and the police estimated Guindon just by himself was making at least $60 million per month in sales. Verg Erslavas, the president of the Satan's Choice Thunder Bay chapter stated: \"After Howard went to the OLs [Outlaws] it opened the door for even more association/biz. By the mid-70s, we were tight with the OLs in many ways.\" Berry was convicted in North Carolina for a series of auto thefts along with an attempt to steal a tank from a United States Army base. upon completing his sentence, Berry was deported to Canada where he was convicted of attempted murder and served his sentence at Collins Bay prison.\n\n\n== Drop-out ==\nAfter completing his prison sentence in the 1980s, Berry left Satan's Choice to live as a reclusive, living a feral existence in a forest in Ontario. Berry is currently living somewhere in hiding.\n\n\n== Books ==\nEdwards, Peter (2017), Hard Road: Bernie Guindon and the Reign of the Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club, HarperCollins, ISBN 978-1443427258\nLangton, Jerry (2010).

        "content": "Chiang Chao-shen (Chinese:江兆申, October 26, 1925 – May 12, 1996), styled Jiaoyuan (茮原), and also known by the studio name Lingou Hall (靈漚館), was born on the banks of Fengxi (豐溪) River in Yanci Town (巖寺鎮), She County, Anhui Province.: 10  He was a Taiwanese calligrapher, painter, and seal engraver, as well as a scholar in the study of Chinese painting and calligraphy. Chiang Chao-shen held prominent positions at the National Palace Museum in Taiwan, serving as the deputy director and Director of the Painting and Calligraphy Department. On May 12, 1996, he unexpectedly passed away due to a myocardial infarction while delivering a lecture at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang.: 129 \n\n\n== Life ==\nChiang Chao-shen (1925–1996), born into a scholarly family in She County, Anhui, in 1925, was exposed to literature and calligraphy under his parents' guidance and his fourth uncle's introduction to Huang Binhong (黃賓虹) during his childhood. In the fourth grade of elementary school, he carved a seal for someone, earning recognition from Deng Sanmu (鄧散木).: 20–21  Influenced by traditional family education, he laid the foundation for his future artistic creations.\nIn 1949, after immigrating to Taiwan, Chiang became a high school teacher and joined Pu xinyu (溥心畬), where he became the disciple of Pu Xinyu, a renowned figure in poetry and literature, studying poetry and prose under his guidance.: 120 \nIn 1965, Chiang held a solo exhibition of calligraphy, painting, and seal carving at Zhongshan Hall. The success of the exhibition garnered praise and led to recommendations from Chen Xueping (陳雪屏) and Ye Gongchao (葉公超), propelling Chiang into the position of Associate Researcher at the National Palace Museum in Taiwan.: 57–58 \nThen Chiang had the opportunity to study a rich variety of Chinese art, benefiting from the extensive collection. He was promoted to Researcher in 1969. In response to an invitation from the U.S. State Department of State, Chiang visited the United States as a visiting researcher for a year. In November of the same year, he published a book titled \"A Study on Tang Yin\" (關於唐寅的研究) in 1973, receiving the Chia-hsin Research Award (嘉新優良著作獎) and the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Culture and Arts Award (中山文藝獎) for his travelogue \"Hualian Notes.\" (花蓮記遊冊): 243–244  Chiang's profound traditional literati background, coupled with his experience in artistic creation, allowed him to present insightful papers and lay the groundwork for academic research and exhibitions.\nIn 1972, Chiang was appointed Director of the Painting and Calligraphy Department at the National Palace Museum, and in the following year, he organized the \" Ninety-Years of Wu School Painting Exhibition.\" (吳派畫九十年展): 26–27 : 126  During his tenure, he delved into the study of ancient books and paintings, dedicating significant time to the research of Ming dynasty painter Tang Yin, as well as the painters in the Suzhou region during the time of Tang Yin (16th century) and completed the chronology of Wen Zhengming (文徵明).: 16–17  In 1978, he was promoted to deputy director of the National Palace Museum while retaining his position as Director of the Painting and Calligraphy Department. He served at the National Palace Museum for twenty-seven years. In addition to his academic expertise, he also contributed to the administrative work of the museum.\nAfter retiring in September 1991, Chiang moved to the lakeside of Liyu Pond (鯉魚潭) in Puli, Nantou County, establishing \"Jieshe Garden.\" (揭涉園) During this period, he developed a new style in his ink painting by depicting the scenery of Nantou. He continued to create prolifically, producing high-quality works, and was frequently invited to participate in exhibitions and lectures.: 30–31 \nIn 1992, his \"Wuchen Landscape Album\" (戊辰山水冊) was collected by the British Museum, and a solo exhibition titled \"Chiang Chao-shen Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition\" (江兆申書畫展) was held at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum. The following year, fifty selected pieces embarked on a touring exhibition, starting at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.: 129  Chiang Chao-shen passed away suddenly on May 12, 1996, due to a heart attack during an academic lecture at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang.\n\n\n== References ==",

Legends of Alexander's exploits coalesced into the third-century Alexander Romance which, in the premodern period, went through over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations and was translated into almost every European vernacular and every language of the Islamic world. After the Bible, it was the most popular form of European literature. It was also translated into every language from the Islamicized regions of Asia and Africa, from Mali to Malaysia.\nThe first appearance of Alexander traditions in Arabic literature occurs in the first extant Arabic book, the Quran, in its description of Dhu al-Qarnayn. Alexander was widely believed to be Dhu al-Qarnayn, and this identification is found in some of the earliest texts which discuss this, like the biography of Muhammad by Ibn Ishaq and the commentary on the Quran by Muqatil ibn Sulayman. Likewise, Alexandrian texts feature among the earliest known texts translated from other languages into Arabic, such as the Rasāʾil Arisṭāṭālīsa ilāʾl-Iskandar (The Letters of Aristotle to Alexander or the Epistolary Romance), consisting of a set of apocryphal letters meant to confirm Alexander's reputation as a wise ruler produced during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) from sources originally in Greek. Versions of the Alexander Romance were repeatedly translated into Arabic from Syriac, Latin, and Hebrew throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, the most popular being the Sirat al-Iskandar. These stories about Alexander were believed to be historically factual by the people who transmitted them.\n\n\n== Quran ==\n\n\n=== Dhu al-Qarnayn ===\n\nAlexander was often identified with Dhu al-Qarnayn (Arabic: ذو القرنين; lit. \"The Two-Horned One\"), a figure that appears in the Quran. This identification would play a role in enhancing the popularity of the Arabic Alexander tradition, which often made Alexander synonymous with his attributed Two-Horned title.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nEarlier in Surah al-Kahf, a pericope in the Quran presents Moses in search for the Fountain of Life (18:60–64). This pericope resembles earlier legends where Alexander the Great searches for the Fountain of Life in texts such as the Alexander Romance (in its Greek α recension from the third century), the Babylonian Talmud, and the Song of Alexander. Some studies have looked into why the protagonist was shifted from Alexander to Moses in the version as the narrative appears in the Quran.\nRecently, Zishan Ghaffar has also argued for the role played by Alexander legends in shaping the narrative that appears in 27:15–44.\n\n\n== Genres ==\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nDoufikar-Aerts has divided the Arabic Alexander literature into four categories or genres of literature. The first is the literature in the tradition of Pseudo-Callisthenes, or the 'Pseudo-Callisthenes tradition' or the Arabic Alexander Romance tradition, which focused on the biographical elements of Alexander's career. The second is the 'Alexander and Wisdom literature' tradition. The third is the Dhu al-Qarnayn tradition, related to texts from the Qisas al-Anbiya (Tales of the Prophets) literature. This tradition was rooted in the Quranic figure of Dhu al-Qarnayn. The fourth is the Sirāt al-Iskandar tradition, which follows in the tradition of a popular romance known as the Sīrat al-Iskandar.\n\n\n=== Wisdom literature ===\nThe Alexander Romance also had an important influence on Arabic wisdom literature. Arabic was introduced as the court language of the caliphate during the Umayyad Caliphate around the year 700. One of the first texts translated into Arabic was the Rasāʾil Arisṭāṭālīsa ilāʾl-Iskandar (The Letters of Aristotle to Alexander or the Epistolary Romance), which consists of a set of apocryphal letters meant to confirm Alexander's reputation as a wise ruler. It was composed during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) from Greek sources like the Epistola Alexandri ad Aristotelem.\nPart of this text became a constituent of the Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār (Book of Secret of Secrets) by Yahya ibn al-Batriq (d. 815), a Pseudo-Aristoteliean treatise which became immensely popular and was translated directly from the Arabic into many other (including European) languages. Both Alexander and Aristotle became important figures in Islamic wisdom literature, such as in the chapter dedicated to Alexander in the 9th-century Ādāb al-Falāsifa (Sayings of the Philosophers) written in the name of the famous Christian translator and physician Hunayn ibn Ishaq. Other texts in this tradition from the tenth century onward included Ṣiwān al-Ḥikma (Chest of Wisdom) of Abu Sulayman Sijistani, the Al-Ḥikma al-Khālida (Everlasting Wisdom) of Miskawayh, and the Al-Kalim al-Rūḥānīya fīʾl-Ḥikam al-Yūnānīya (Spiritual Sayings about Greek Maxims) of Ibn Hindu.\nNotably, the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tasim (794–842 AD) had ordered the translation of the Thesaurus Alexandri, a work on elixirs and amulets, from Greek and Latin into Arabic. The Greek work Thesaurus Alexandri was attributed to Hermes (the great messenger of the gods in Greek mythology) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.\nIn Secretum Secretorum (\"Secret of Secrets\", in Arabic Kitab sirr al-asrar), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as statecraft, ethics, physiognomy, alchemy, astrology, magic and medicine, Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as Aristotle. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No Greek original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into Syriac and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, Yahya ibn al-Bitriq (?–815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.\nAnother piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in Syriac and was later translated into Arabic and expanded upon. The Laments of the Philosophers eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe.\n\n\n=== Romance literature ===\nThe Syriac Alexander Romance, alongside some apocalyptic traditions it incorporated from the shorter Syriac Alexander Legend, would become the main source for Arabic Alexander Romance tradition and for Arabic-language historians who wanted to discuss the role of Alexander in pre-Islamic history. One such history was the Kitāb al-Akhbār al-Ṭiwal (Book of Comprehensive History) of Abu Hanifa Dinawari (d. 896), itself based on an older version in Pseudo-Aṣma‛ī's Nihāyat al-Arab (Ultimate Aim), includes a short history of the kingdom of Alexander in this tradition. Other examples include the Tārīkh (Historiae) of al-Yaʿqūbī (d. 897), the al-Rusul waʾl-Mulūk (History of the Prophets and Kings, or simply Annales) of al-Tabbari (d. 923), the Murūj al-Dhahab (Meadows of Gold) of al-Masudi (d. 956), and the Naẓm al-Jawhar (String of Pearls) of Eutychius of Alexandria.\nThe earliest full-length Arabic Alexander Romance was the Qissat al-Iskandar of ʿUmara ibn Zayd, composed in the late 8th or early 9th century. In the tale, Alexander the Great travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the Water of Life (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a \"wonder-stone\" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish Talmudic traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.\nThe other prominent Arbaic versions would be the Qissat Dhulqarnayn (9th century), a second Qissat Dhulqarnayn in the Ara'is al-majalis fi Qisas al-anbiya'  (Book of Prophets) of al-Tha'labi (11th century), the Hadith Dhulqarnayn (15th century), the Sīrat al-Iskandar (15th century), the Sirat al-malek Eskandar Dhu’ l-Qarneyn, and the Tārīkh al-Iskandar al-Makdūni (History of Alexander of Macedon) (17th century).\n\n\n=== Tales of the prophets ===\nOne figure transmitting Alexander legends in the tradition of the qiṣaṣ genre was Wahb ibn Munabbih, although this is according to an attribution later made by Ibn Hisham. According to Ibn Hisham, Dhu al-Qarnayn should be identified with a South Arabian king named Sa'b Dhu Marathid as opposed to Alexander, although Sa'b is a mythical figure whose biography is derivative from Alexander's in the tradition of Pseudo-Callisthenes. That Ibn Hisham's traditions go back to Wahb as he stated is doubtful. The Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the Water of Life. The story also mentions that Dhu al-Qarnayn visited a castle with glass walls and visited the Brahmins of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.\nAnother transmitter who Alexander traditions are attributed to was Ka'b al-Ahbar.\n\n\n=== Sirat al-Iskandar ===\nThe Sīrat al-Iskandar (Life of Alexander) is a 13th-century popular Arabic-language romance about Alexander the Great. It belongs to the sīra shaʿbiyya genre. In the Sīrat, Alexander is a son of Dārāb, a prince of the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia, and Nāhīd, daughter of King Philip II of Macedon. He is born in secret at Philip's court and is raised by Aristotle. He eventually succeeds Philip as king, while his half-brother Dārā succeeds to the Persian throne. They go to war and Alexander is victorious, with Dārā dying in his arms. After returning to Macedon, Alexander comes under the influence of the devil, Iblīs, until he is brought back to the right path by al-Khiḍr, who convinces him he has a divine mission: to convert the whole world to monotheism. The two travel first to the West and then to the East, converting people everywhere they go. Alexander then constructs the famous wall confining Gog and Magog before setting out for the Land of Darkness to find the Water of Life. He is prevented from reaching the water by the Isrāfīl (angels), who instead give him the wonderstone. Shortly after, Alexander writes a letter of consolation to his mother and dies. He is buried in Alexandria.\n\n\n== Representations ==\nArabic literature produced stories about heroes, saints, poets, and men of wisdom. Biographies, romances, poems, and so forth celebrated literary protagonists, among them one of the most popular being Alexander the Great. While portraits and representations of Alexander in the Arab and Islamic tradition has continuity with earlier representations, it also developed its own nuances.\nOne representation was of Alexander as a strategist, especially in light of his vast conquests from such a small territory, including the subjugation of many lands that the Umayyads reconquered later. A group of apocryphal letters translated during the reign of the caliph Hisham between Alexander and Aristotle (Alexander's tutor) describes how Alexander was advised by Aristotle as to how he should go about his campaigns. These include recommendations in good government, rulership, fair treatment to subdued nations, and more. Though Alexander never pursued Arabia, the letters describe the Arabians as one of his subjects. One piece of advice was that Alexander should allow troops nightly drinking parties (a pre-Islamic recommendation which was not conformed into Islamic ethics in the text). These texts went on to have an enormous impact on Arabic-related Alexander traditions.\nAnother was that of the sage. This is especially visible in wisdom literature, which included wise sayings, maxims, anthologies of anecdotes, and ascriptions of exemplary conduct on great figures from the past. Such stories are rooted in Hellenistic sources and often remained closer to their originals during translation. The Greek historian Plutarch wrote in his \"On the Fortune or Virtue of Alexander the Great\" argued that Alexander would qualify as a true philosopher by the same criteria used to judge others like Pythagoras and Socrates: by judging him based on his manner of life and the principles he taught. Maxims emphasizing the greater nature of what Alexander gained from Aristotle, in knowledge, over what he gained from his father Philip, in weaponry, was repeated by the Arabic compiler Mubashshir ibn Fatik; Mubashshir recorded a maxim where when Alexander asked if he valued his teacher or father more, he answered \"My father is the cause of my life, but my teacher is the cause of the quality of my life\". Representations of Alexander as a philosopher king were widespread. Another text where they can also be found in Hunayn ibn Ishaq's Anecdotes of Philosophers and Sages.\nAlexander as a pioneer was another popular portrait. In the Arabic Epistola Alexandri, Alexander describes his personal observations during his journeys. He constructs temples for prayer and was seen as a proto-monotheist foreshadowing the coming of Christianity and Islam. His exploits were depicted as deeds of cleverness and boldness, and the result of divine providence. He sent many letters to the rulers of foreign nations in order to compel them into monotheism.\n\n\n== Geography and cartography ==\nOne of the most famous elements of Alexander's biography was his concealment of Gog and Magog behind a barrier which they remain imprisoned by until the end of the world. Such ideas caught the attention of geographers, who were interested in finding these barriers or representing them in the maps they produced. Like in medieval Christendom, medieval world maps, also known as mappa mundi, were produced which depicted Gog and Magog in the far corners of the Earth. One tenth-century Arab geographer and chronicler, Ibn Hawqal, produced maps based on his own travels and inspired by earlier ones by Ptolemy. His map was part of his geographical work, the Ṣūrat al-ʾArḍ (\"Image of the Earth\"), a manuscript for which exists dating to 1086. The \"regions of Gog and Magog\" in this map is situated in the northwestern part of the world. Muhammad al-Idrisi was an Arab geographer who, in 1154, was commissioned by the Norman king Roger II of Sicily into producing a work that came to be known in Western languages as the Tabula Rogeriana (or the \"The Excursion of One Eager to Penetrate the Distant Horizons\" in Arabic). In this map, a considerable part of the world is in the northernmost section and is inhabited by Gog and Magog. One copy of this map known as the  Charta Rogeriana depicts Gog and Magog as being enclosed by a mountain range called the jabal Qūfāia and has an Arabic caption in a Latinized script which reads sadd ḏī ’l karnajin, al musamma bi al rad[ ] (radm?), \"The Barrier of Dhū ’l-Qarnayn, called the Rampart\". The words sadd and radm were taken from the Quran, 18:94, 95. This practice was followed into Iranian maps, such as the fifteenth-century Mojmal al-Tawārīkh wa ’l-Qeṣaṣ.\n\nSeveral expeditions in the Muslim world were undertaken to try to find and study Alexander's wall, specifically the Caspian Gates of Derbent. An early expedition to  Derbent was ordered by the Caliph Umar (d. 644) himself, during the Arab conquest of Armenia where they heard about Alexander's Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians, according to the exegetes Al-Tabarani (873–970 AD) and Ibn Kathir (1301–1373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229 AD):... Umar sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered Armenia, the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...Two hundred years later, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Wathiq (d. 847) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by Sallam-ul-Tarjuman, whose observations were recorded by Yaqut al-Hamawi and by Ibn Kathir:...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].The Muslim geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading \"Khazar\" (Caspian) he writes:This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.The Caliph Harun al-Rashid (763 – 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer Ibn Battuta (1304–1369 AD) travelled to China on order of the Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq and he comments in his travel log that \"Between it [the city of Zaitun in Fujian] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel.\" The translator of the travel log notes that Ibn Battuta confused the Great Wall of China with that supposedly built by Dhul-Qarnayn.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nAn Arabic translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes is evidenced by the Akhbār Al-Iskandar, a brief biography. This text in turn is known from the Mukhtār al-Ḥikam wa-Maḥāsin al-Kalim ('Selection of Proverbs and an Anthology of Sayings') by Mubashshir ibn Fātik. In Europe, this text was known as the Bocados de Oro. The question of the source language for the major Arabic version of Pseudo-Callisthenes, however, has been contentious. According to Theodor Nöldeke in the late 19th century, the lost δ recension of the Greek Romance was translated into Middle Persian (Pahlavi). The Pahlavi version, also lost, was translated into Syriac as the Syriac Alexander Romance and it was the Syriac version that was the ultimate source of the Arabic sometime before the 9th century. More recently, this theory has been questioned and others have suggested that a translation could have been made directly from the Greek.\nIn Latin, a version of the Alexander Romance known as the Historia de preliis was produced as a recension of the earlier tenth-century Nativitas et victoria Alexandri Magni regis produced by Leo the Archpriest. The Hebrew translation of this text is thought to have been produced not directly from the Latin, but from a now-lost Arabic intermediary translation that must have been produced prior to 1061.\nThe Tārīkh al-Iskandar al-Makdūni (History of Alexander of Macedon), translated into Arabic by the Melkite bishop Yuwāsif ibn Suwaydān (c. 1669) from the Byzantine ζ-recension of Pseudo-Callisthenes. It is fairly late and so had little influence on the Arabic Alexander tradition.\n\n\n== History of scholarship ==\nThe study of the Arabic tradition of the Alexander Romance was founded by Theodor Nöldeke with his publication Beiträge zur geschichte des Alexanderromans in 1890. In 1901, Karl Friederich Weymann published a study on translations of the Romance into Arabic and Ethiopic, titled Die aethiopische und arabische Übersetzung des Pseudocallisthenes. In this study, Weymann proposed a tentative reconstruction of an Arabic version of the Romance which might have served as an intermediary between the Syriac and Ethiopic versions. He dated the Arabic translation, which he thought must exist, to the first half of the 9th century. However, the existence of an Arabic translation would remain conjectural until the accidental discovery of a manuscript of the Hadith Dhulqarnayn (or the Leyenda de Alejandro) in 1929 by Emilio Garcia Gomez. This constituted definitive evidence for the translation, and also demonstrated the importance of the Syriac recension in the transmission of the Romance into Arabic.\nAnother strand of scholarship focused on Dhu al-Qarnayn traditions, such as Mark Lidzbarski who published an Arabic 'Alexandergeschichte' or, a chapter on Dhu al-Qarnayn, from the Kitab at-Tījān (Book of Crowns) of Ibn Hisham in 1893. Lidzbarski believed that the ultimate (though not direct) source for the traditions in Ibn Hisham's work, at least respect to its description of the Fountain of Life, was to be sought in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Ibn Hisham imputed the traditions he described to a Yemenite king known as Sa'b Dhu Marathid, but Lidzbarski understood that the traditions about Sa'b are derived from traditions of Alexander the Great in the Romance tradition. In 1913, Friedlaender published his volume Die Chadhirlegende und der Alexanderroman, the main topic of which was the fountain of life traditions but was also very informative about a variety of other topics. Despite its importance, the book did not exert much influence on scholarship until later due to the attitude that existed that scholarly work on the Arabic Alexander tradition from the 19th century had already resolved the major questions. After the first half of the 20th cenury, renewed attention came to the Arabic tradition. One of the primary contributors from this period was Mario Grignaschi; one of his primary contributions was the sensational discovery of a manuscript from the Aya Sofya collection of an Arabic adaptation of the Epistolary Romance cycle, a fictionalized correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle. It was composed during the reign of the caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in the first half of the 8th century. This finding also confirmed Alexander's place and importance in the Arabic Wisdom literature.\nIn 1978, Tilman Nagel published his Alexander der Grosse in der frühislamischen Volksliteratur. Nagel pioneered a new way with dealing with the material in Ibn Hisham's Kitab, forsaking the older method of the comparative study of legend and instead aimed at deducing the earliest sources and origins of the different elements of the narrative. He also placed the work in its historical and social context, viewing it as an autonomous literary phenomena that occupied a particular national consciousness. His work would anticipate additional innovations in the study of popular Arabic literature towards the end of the 20th century. In these decades, a few short surveys appeared of the oriental Arabic tradition, including that of Stephen Gero, Hamad Bin Seray, and a proceedings of a congress on Alexander published by Fahd, Mazzaoui, Macuch, and Marin. Other recent developments include the work of the historian François de Polignac and, most importantly of all, the edition and translation of Islamic Legends Concerning Alexander the Great by Z. David Zuwiyya.\nToday, the Arabic tradition of Alexander legends is the best-research of all divisions of the eastern tradition about Alexander, in large (but not exclusive) part to the more recent contributions by Faustina Doufikar-Aerts, such as in her book Alexander Magnus Arabicus.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlexander the Great in Islamic tradition\nSong of Alexander\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDoufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). \"The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar\".

        "content": "Emmanuel Guibert (born April 21, 1964, in Paris) is a French comics artist and writer. For his work, he has been awarded the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter a short period in art school, Guibert found work as an illustrator and storyboarder. He began Brune, an album retracing the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. Brune was published in 1992, after seven years of work.\nIn 1999, he began the series Ariol, written by Marc Boutavant, which originated in the children's magazine J'aime lire. Ariol has been collected into seventeen volumes, eleven of which have been translated into English by Papercutz. A French-Canadian series of animated shorts of the same title were also produced.\nGuibert became associated with the magazine Lapin and L'Association  (alongside Frédéric Boilet, Émile Bravo, Fabrice Tarrin, Christophe Blain, and Joann Sfar), which marked an evolution of his work to the service of real-life stories.\nThe first example was La Guerre d'Alan (\"Alan's War\"), which was serialized in Lapin in 2000; it recounts the memories of Alan Ingram Cope, an American soldier from World War II living in France. This was followed by Le Photographe (\"The Photographer\"), the story of Didier Lefèvre, a French photojournalist who accompanied a Médecins Sans Frontières mission during the height of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1986. The Photographer sold 250,000 copies in France and won the Essentials of Angoulême award in 2007. It has been translated from the original French into 11 languages; the American edition won the Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material in 2010.\nDuring this same period, he created several series, including Sardine de l'espace, Les Olives noirs, and La Fille du professeur  (\"The Professor's Daughter\") (with Joann Sfar).\nIn 2013,Guibert was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in recognition of his significant contributions to the arts.\nIn January 2018, the Angoulême International Comics Festival dedicated an exhibition to Guibert's work.\nAfter being a finalist for the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême in 2019, he was finally elected by the authors during the festival the following year. The Grand Prix is considered the most prestigious award in Franco-Belgian comics.\nIn 2020, he became the first comic book author to whom the Académie des Beaux-Arts dedicated an exhibition.\nIn January 2023, Gubert was elected member of the engraving and drawing section of the Academy of Fine Arts. He occupies the chair of Pierre-Yves Trémois, who died in 2020.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1997 Angoulême International Comics Festival René Goscinny award for  La Fille du professeur, with Joann Sfar\n1998 Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for First Comic Book for La Fille du professeur, with Joann Sfar\n2001:\n(nomination) Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album for Le capitaine écarlate, with David B.\n(nomination) Prix de la critique for Le capitaine écarlate, with David B.\n2002 (nomination) Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Artwork for Les olives noires: Pourquoi cette nuit est-elle, with Joann Sfar\n2004 Prix des libraires de bande dessinée for Le Photographe, with Didier Lefèvre and Frédéric Lemercier\n2005 France Info Prize for Le Photographe vol. 2\n2007:\nAngoulême International Comics Festival Essentials for Le Photographe\nCybils Award: Young Adult prize, for The Professor's Daughter (translation of La Fille du professuer)\n2nd Globes de Cristal Awards for Best Comic Book for Le Photographe\nVilla Kujoyama Prize\n2009:\n(nomination) Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work for Alan's War\nGrand Boum-Ville de Blois (bd BOUM Festival) for lifetime achievement\n2010 Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material for The Photographer\n2013 Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\n2017 Angoulême International Comics Festival René Goscinny award\n2019 (nomination) Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême\n2020 Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrune (Éditions Albin Michel, 1992) ISBN 2-226-05998-9\nLa Fille du professeur (art), with Joann Sfar (story), Dupuis, coll. « Humour libre », 1997.

        "content": "Our Year is a 2014 studio album by American country musicians Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis, released on Robison's Premium Records label. The work was the third of four recordings released by the couple and received positive reviews from critics and commercial success on two Billboard charts.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 4 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing \"this collection of originals and covers goes right to the heart of what made [previous album] Cheater's Game special: the pairing of these voices in a decidedly Texas take on traditional country music\" and exhorted readers \"get this one\". In American Songwriter, Jim Beviglia gave this album 3 out of 5 stars for the musicians \"once again trading lead vocals and harmonizing behind tasteful Americana-type musical backing, finding nooks and crannies in the well-chosen songs that might otherwise have stayed hidden in solo readings\" and continued that the finest parts of the music \"are when the voices come together and it feels like they’re sharing the experiences in the songs\". Doug Freeman of The Austin Chronicle rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that this release finds the musicians \"recapturing the magic\" with \"both playful [songs] and emotional, ripe ballads\". Writing for Exclaim!, Stuart Henderson rated Our Year a 7 out of 10, stating that the emphasis on covers ends up \"lending it a decidedly offhand feel\", but also praising Robison's originals and opining that \"the songs Willis and Robison have chosen to play here are all absorbing, and their close-harmony approach serves the material beautifully\".\nTwo assessments were published in No Depression: Hyperbolium wrote that \"their strengths as singers and songwriters peek through at every turn, but it’s the way their emotional conversation amplifies one another that sets this apart from their solo work\" and Folk Villager opined that \"they’re creating remarkable sounding albums bursting at the seams with impressive songs\". Charles Pitter of PopMatters gave this release a 9 out of 10, summing up \"with an album like this, Bruce and Kelly would have to suffer a strong dose of bad luck for this not to be their year, but if you’re proclaiming your own destiny, who needs stupid old luck anyway?. In USA Today, Brian Mansfield called Our Year \"great songs, well sung and well played\", where each instrument \"gets a moment to shine, but it always supports the song, never obscuring the lyrics or the voices singing them\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Departing Louisiana\" (Robyn Ludwick) – 3:36\n\"Motor City Man\" (Walter Hyatt) – 2:50\n\"Carousel\" (Bruce Robison and Darden Smith) – 3:22\n\"Lonely for You\" (Paul Kennerley and Kelly Willis) – 2:56\n\"A Hangin On\" (Ira Allen and Buddy Mize) – 2:51\n\"Shake Yourself Loose\" (T-Bone Burnett) – 3:31\n\"Harper Valley PTA\" (Tom T.

Because Hoyle won a majority in the May primary election, a November runoff did not occur.\n\n\n== Primary election ==\nThe nonpartisan primary election was held alongside partisan primary elections for other offices on May 15, 2018. Since the Commissioner of Labor is a nonpartisan role, a general election is only held if no one in the primary election secures 50% of the vote. Hoyle avoided a runoff vote and was elected to the role by winning 52.28% of the vote in the primary election.\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nJack Howard, Union County Commissioner\nVal Hoyle, former Majority Leader of the Oregon House of Representatives\nLou Ogden, Mayor of Tualatin\nWhile the position of Labor Commissioner is nonpartisan, Ogden is known to be a Republican, while Howard and Hoyle are Democrats.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2018 Oregon gubernatorial election\n2018 Oregon state elections\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1986, they changed name to Club Esportiu Escola de Futbol Almacelles i Comarca.\nAfter being only an amateur team, EFAC Almacelles started playing in a senior competition in 1988, winning promotion from the Tercera Regional. They first reached the top tier of regional football, the Primera Catalana, in 2011.\nAfter playing the following years between Primera and Segona Catalana, EFAC reached an agreement with Club Esportiu Atlètic Lleida (a club founded on 22 June 2019) in late June 2019, with the latter taking over their place in the fifth tier from the 2020–21 season onwards.

        "content": "Zhanna Zasseeva is an Ossetian politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the UN recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== State Councilor ===\nFrom 2005 to 2017 Zasseeva served as State Councilor for Eduard Kokoity, Vadim Brovtsev, and Leonid Tibilov. During the latter of which, in 2013, praised a state-run poll which claimed mass support for the newly implemented holiday \"Day of Russia\" stating that \"I cannot imagine my life without Russia.\" By 2016 she was the State Adviser to the President, as well as a member of the commission for drafting the Constitution of South Ossetia. In which capacity she stated that the new Constitution must prioritze basic rule of law, and the independence of the South Ossetian judiciary, to work on a purely meritocratic system. She also claimed that her primary inspiration was the Constitution of North Ossetia, and that her proposal was well received by unnamed Russian officials.\n\n\n=== Minister of culture ===\nZasseeva served as the minister of culture for Anatoly Bibilov, President from 2017 to 2022. In that capacity claimed that the 1918-1920 Georgian–Ossetian conflict was a genocide and organized a nationwide memorial for the 100th anniversary in 2019 alongside Amiran Dyakonov. In 2019 she also announced the creation of a national day of mourning for the Zar tragedy when the Georgian army shelled a convoy of trucks, which South Ossetia claimed was a refugee column, killing 33 civilians.\nAs Minister of Culture, Zasseeva supported an effort to integrate with the Conservatorio Statale di Musica \"Gioachino Rossini\" in conjunction with Dmitriy Medoev, minister of foreign affairs, and Gennadiy Kokoev, the minister of the economy. The South Ossetian government touted the effort, as cooperation with Italy, to increase support for South Ossetian recognition in Europe. Additionally, Zasseeva went on a state visit to Abkhazia alongside Medoev, Oleg Botsiev, the South Osstian ambassador to Abkhazia, Uruzmag Dzhagaev, the South Ossetian prosecutor general, and Viktor Shargaev, head of the State Security Committee to promote bilateral relations, and a joint effort for international recognition.\nIn the wake of the Murder of Inal Djabiev, Zasseeva, along with South Ossetia's Ombudsman, Inal Tasoev, were among a delegation sent to Djabiev's house, following massive public backlash, promising a fair investigation into his death, however, Djabiev's widow rebuked them, stating \"We distrust both MPs and investigators.\" One of Zasseeva's last acts as minister was to unveil a memorial to the Ered tragedy, where South Ossetia accuses Georgia of burying 12 Ossetians alive.\n\n\n=== Women's league ===\nFollowing her departure from politics, Zasseeva has founded and leads an NGO, the \"Women's league,\" which, as it's chairwoman, endorsed an effort to change South Ossetian history curriculum to center around the \"Alan Code of Honor\", focusing on Ossetians loyal to Russia since 1749. She also promoted the expansion of Immortal Regiments in South Ossetia.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Contested over 400 laps on the 1-mile (1.6 km) concrete speedway, it will be the 11th race of the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDover Motor Speedway is an oval race track in Dover, Delaware, United States that has held at least two NASCAR races since it opened in 1969. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the NTT IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete oval, with 24° banking in the turns and 9° banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Speedway Motorsports.\nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nFox Sports will cover the race on the television side. Mike Joy, Clint Bowyer and three-time Dover winner Kevin Harvick will call the race from the broadcast booth. Jamie Little and Regan Smith will handle pit road for the television side, and Larry McReynolds will provide insight from the Fox Sports studio in Charlotte.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPRN will have the radio call for the race and will also be simulcasted on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Doug Rice & Mark Garrow will call the race from the broadcast booth when the field raced down the front straightaway. Pat Patterson will call the race from atop a scaffold when the field raced thru turns 3 & 4.

The species is found distributed in marine waters north of Australia, occurring near and in areas such as the Coral Sea, Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. Habitats include waters 19 to 200 meters below sea level in neritic zones. Individuals reach lengths of 22 to 26 centimeters, with body colorations of light to dark blue with red feet and tentacles colored violet, blue, and red with white tips. The species feeds through filter feeding, catching organic matter such as algae, phytoplankton, and detritus with its tentacles. It is occasionally kept in saltwater tanks in the aquarium hobby, however is recommended to only be cared by those with expertise in the hobby due to a risk of it secreting toxins if stressed, such as with some fish species that are prone to pick at the tentacles of sea cucumbers.\n\n\n== References ==",

The musical is based on the novel A Death in the Family written by James Agee, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction upon its release in 1957.\nThe title comes from the setting of the story in Knoxville, Tennessee, where original author Agee was from. The show is set in 1915.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe show was announced on February 6, 2019, with a concert reading held in New York City featuring Claybourne Elder. The musical was originally scheduled to premiere in the spring of 2020 at Asolo Repertory Theatre in Sarasota, Florida, however these plans were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was conceived by Galati who enlisted the music team of Ahrens and Flaherty to help construct the show. Rescheduling the show took nearly two years until 2022 when it was announced to be part of Asolo's 2022–2023 season. The world premiere was held from April 23 through May 11, 2022. The show was choreographed by Josh Rhodes.\nGalati died on January 2, 2023, months after the world premiere of the project.\n\n\n== Original cast and characters ==\n\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n\"Knoxville\" - Company\n\"Father to Son\" - Jay\n\"Ralphs Here\" - Mary, Jay, Ralph, Sally\n\"Outside Your Window\" - Company\n\"Outside Your Window (reprise)\" - Mary, Jay\n\"Ordinary People\" - Mary\n\"Life is in a Store\" - James, Hannah, Rufus\n\"The Ferryman\" - Jay\n\"Waking in Darkness\" - Company\n\"Whatever It Is\" - Hannah, Rufus\n\"A Cottor Pin\" - Company\n\"Waking in Darkness (reprise)\" - Joel\n\"That's What I Believe / Outside Your Window (reprise)\" - James, Jay\n\"Simple Biology\" - Rufus\n\"Black Dress\" - Sally, Catherine, Jessie\n\"The Dressmaker and the Milliner\" - Catherine\n\"Stillness\" - James\n\"In His Strength\" - Mary, Jay, Hannah, Rufus\n\"The Butterfly\" - Andrew\n\"Knoxville (reprise)\" - Company\nA cast album was released following the world premiere with the original cast and is available from Broadway Records.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

His first airplane was a Grumman vehicle and its first camera was a Fairchild. The service was absorbed by the Peruvian Air Force and took on various names, including that of \"General Directorate of Aerial Photography\" (Spanish: Dirección General de Aerofotografía).\nThe National Aerophotographic Service took the aerial photographs to prepare the basic cartography of the scale of 1 to 100,000. The charter was financed by the Defense Mapping Agency of the United States, who financed them and also the National Geographic Institute to prepare the country's National Charter.\nIt is presently focused on military operations with a priority of work against internal threats: illegal mining, terrorism in the VRAEM, illicit drug trafficking and risk management.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAerial photography\nPeruvian Air Force\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rudolf von Bennigsen (Bennigsen near Springe, 12 May 1859 – Berlin, 3 May 1912) was a German colonial official. He was the governor of German New Guinea from 1 April 1899 to 10 July 1901.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nBennigsen was a son of the Reichstag member Rudolf von Bennigsen. He was descended from an old Hanoverian family, which was named after its Bennigsen estate near Springe. He studied law at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Strasbourg and in 1878 became a member of the Corps Suevia there. When there was a crisis in the mid-1880s, he became active again and fought as an assessor for the First Batch. For this, Suevia later awarded him honorary membership. The SC-Comradeship of the Corps was named after him in 1941.\nBennigsen was government assessor in the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine, then district administrator of the Prussian district of Peine. In 1893 he became financial director in the colony of German East Africa, where he also acted as deputy to the local governor. In German East Africa, at Bennigsen's suggestion, the \"hut tax\" was introduced in 1897, the ruthless collection of which led to countless uprisings among the local population in the following years.\nOn 1 April 1899, Bennigsen was appointed the first governor of German New Guinea and the island area of the Carolines, Palau and the Marianas. In the same year he moved the seat of the colonial administration from Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen (today Madang) on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland to Herbertshöhe (today Kokopo) on the island of Neupommern (today New Britain). Bennigsen was mainly concerned with enforcing the German Empire's claim to colonial power through punitive expeditions – he himself spoke of \"bringing order to the neglected conditions in the colony of German New Guinea\". In June 1900, Robert Koch was a guest of Bennigsen in Herbertshöhe during his New Guinea expedition to research malaria. Whether for political or health reasons remains unclear, but on 10 July 1901, Bennigsen ended his service in German New Guinea by handing over the governorship to Albert Hahl.\nIn 1902 Bennigsen became a board member of the German Colonial Society for South West Africa. From 1904 to 1909 he was a representative of Kölnische Zeitung in Berlin, from 1909 to 1912 director of the German Colonial Society for South West Africa, on whose behalf he made trips to German South West Africa in 1903 and 1910.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(in German) Heinrich Schnee (Hrsg.): Deutsches Kolonial-Lexikon.

Afghanistan initiated the arming and financing of proxies in the border regions of Waziristan and Khyber, namely Afridi Sarishtas and Ipi Faqir, under the banner of 'Liberation of Pashtunistan'. Consequently, numerous skirmishes erupted between Pakistani security forces and Afghan-backed proxies.\n\n\n== Aerial raid ==\nIn June 1949, a Pakistan Air Force warplane belonging to No. 14 Squadron PAF bombed a militant camp in the village of Mughalgai on the Afghan side of the Waziristan border while chasing the Pashtunistan separatist forces loyal to the Faqir of Ipi who attacked Pakistani military border posts from within Afghan territory,this airstrike killed 23 people and further fueled Afghan support for Pashtunistan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA tribal council was held by Afghan government in the capital Kabul which declared all treaties related to Durand line as null and void and thus declared full support for Pashtunistan, this was accompanied by further financial and military aid to separatists including the establishment of an arms factory.\nOn 31 August, 'Pashtunistan Day' was designated, an occasion consistently observed by the Afghan government. Proxies supported by Afghanistan declared the establishment of 'Pashtunistan' in Tirah (Khyber) and Razmak (Waziristan), appointing Faqir of Ipi as President of the Pashtunistan national assembly.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWaziristan campaign (1919–1920)\nWaziristan campaign (1936–1939)\nWaziristan rebellion of 1948-1954\nBajaur Campaign\nPakistan-Afghanistan skirmishes\nPashtunistan\nFaqir of Ipi\n1950 Afghan invasion of Balochistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nKaur, Kulwant (1985).

        "content": "The war memorial on Île du Souvenir is a war memorial dedicated to the victims of World War I, located on Île du Souvenir (or Île aux Cygnes) in the Parc de la Tête-d'Or in Lyon, France.\nArchitect Tony Garnier designed it and sculptors Jean-Baptiste Larrivé (cenotaph), Louis Bertola (bas-reliefs of Le Départ and La Guerre), and Claude Grange (bas-reliefs of La Paix and La Victoire) also contributed to the work.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city of Lyon launched a competition for a new war memorial in December 1920. The result of the first round was the selection of ten projects, five of which were proposals by Tony Garnier. His project \"Athéna\", a huge temple with a double colonnade on the hill of La Croix-Rousse, won the competition in the second round. However, this project was abandoned because it was too expensive. The winner was the \"Philae\" project, the result of a collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Larrivé.\nThe ensemble has been the subject of several redesigns: an initial group of six columns, each with a statue at the top, was replaced in 1922 by two fluted shafts rising from the water, which were also abandoned. Similarly, the project called for a perimeter wall with a frieze topped by colonnettes with a garland of plants, and stairs at the rear of the cenotaph - overly ambitious features that were never built.\nTony Garnier worked with sculptors Jean-Baptiste Larrivé for the cenotaph and Louis Bertola and Claude Grange for the bas-reliefs. The island itself was created and landscaped between 1924 and 1930.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe inspiration for this project was Arnold Böcklin's painting Isle of the Dead. It is composed of a central piece, a cenotaph, which represents six bearers of a tombstone, wrapped in a shroud. It is a tribute to the 10,600 Lyonnais who died fighting for France in World War I. After Jean-Baptiste Larrivé died, his brother Auguste Larrivé finished the work.\nFour bas-reliefs were created by Louis Bertola (Le Départ and La Guerre) and Claude Grange (La Paix and La Victoire). The monument was built from blocks of stone taken from the quarries of Cruchaud (Buxy) and Goulot (Montagny-lès-Buxy).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nListed as a historical monument since November 4, 1982, the building is part of the Parc de la Tête-d'Or pak complex, which, in addition to the war memorial, includes:\n\nThe main gate with its columns (Porte des Enfants du Rhône, Place du Général-Leclerc).\nThe Montgolfier Gate (Avenue Verguin).\nThe Camellia and Pandanus greenhouses.\nOn March 10, 2003, the building was awarded the label \"Heritage of the 20th Century\". A plaque commemorating this label has been placed nearby since November 2004.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\nIn 2013, the monument was renovated and cleaned so that the 10,600 names inscribed on the cenotaph could be read (which was no longer possible). The island was closed for several years in a row, but after renovation, it was reopened to the public in early 2017.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nDufieux, Philippe (2007).

It was published by Yale University Press in 2021 when Sprinchorn was 98. It is described as a biography and more specifically as a biographical reading of Ibsen's plays.\nThe book was criticized by Norwegian Ibsen scholars, in particular by Ellen Rees for perpetuating outdated and debunked myths about Ibsen. Helge Rønning argued that \"in many ways it is more an inventive analysis of Ibsen’s works than a biography.\" Its approach of using Ibsen's plays as biographical sources has been criticized in recent Ibsen scholarship. The book was positively reviewed by American scholars.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Waldegrave (fl. 1689) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWaldegrave was probably the second son of Philip Waldegrave of Borley in Essex (a cadet of the family of Waldegrave of Chewton), by his second wife, Margaret, daughter of John Eve of Easton in Essex, and, if so, was born in 1618. He received the degree of doctor of medicine of Padua on 12 March 1659, and was admitted an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians, London, in December 1664. He was created a fellow of the college, by the charter of James II of England, in 1686, but does not appear to have been admitted as such at the comitia majora extraordinaria of 12 April 1687, which was specially convened for the reception of the charter and the admission of those who were thereby constituted fellows.\nOn 1 July 1689 he was returned to the House of Lords by the college as a ‘papist.’ He was Physician to the queen of James II, and, as Bishop Burnet tells us, was hastily summoned, along with Sir Charles Scarburgh, to her majesty in 1688, shortly before the birth of the Prince of Wales (the ‘Old Pretender’), when she was in danger of miscarrying. In 1691 434l. 10s. was owing to him from the estate of Henry, first baron Waldegrave (Hist. MSS. Comm. 13th Rep. App. v. 446). He is there styled Sir William, but his name does not appear in Townsend's ‘Catalogue of Knights.’ He is believed to have died a bachelor.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1899). \"Waldegrave, William (fl.1689)\".

        "content": "Robert Vilvain (1575? – 1663) was an English physician and philanthropist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVilvain was born born in the parish of All Hallows, Goldsmith Street, Exeter, and baptised in its church on 17 March 1575–6, was the son of Peter Vilvain, steward of Exeter in 1579, who died on 25 September 1602, by his wife Ann, who died on 24 Sept. 1616. Robert received his early education at Exeter, and matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 22 February 1593–4, aged 18. He graduated B.A. on 9 May 1597 and M.A. on 11 July 1600. On 30 June 1599 he was elected to a Devonian fellowship of his college, which he held until 30 June 1611.\nVilvain began to practise medicine about 1600, and on 20 June 1611 took the Oxford degrees of M.B. and M.D. He was incorporated at Cambridge in 1608, and with these further degrees was reincorporated in 1612. From this date he practised with great success in his native city, dwelling there for the rest of his days. In 1640 he was one of twelve doctors—five in theology, four in medicine, and three in law—living in Exeter. His epigram on them, the English translation, and a list of their names are printed in Richard Izacke's ‘History of Exeter’ (1723 edit. p. 156). With his charitable benefactions and decreasing strength there came a loss of income; the preface to his ‘Enchiridium Epigrammatum’ (1654) refers to his ‘ruined fortune.’ Between 17 April and 4 November 1662 there are frequent references in the state papers (Domestic Series) to the lease to him from 1647 by the dean and chapter of Exeter of the manor of Staverton, which he ‘deserves to forfeit for ill-carriage during the late distractions.’ He died on 21 February 1662–3, and was buried in the north aisle of the choir of Exeter Cathedral, where a stone marked his resting-place; a mural tablet to his memory was placed on the north side of the entrance to the lady-chapel, but was later in St. James's Chantry. His wife Ellenor, second daughter of Thomas Hinson of Tavistock, who married Anne, daughter of Sir William Spring of Pakenham, Suffolk, was buried at All Hallows, Exeter, on 7 December 1622. Their only child, Thomas, matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 8 April 1636, aged 16, graduated B.C.L. on 7 March 1641–2, and died unmarried on 20 May 1651 (Boase, Exeter College Commoners, p. 338). Ten ‘epicedial distichs’ composed on his death are in the father's ‘Enchiridium Epigrammatum,’ leaf 185.\n‘In his younger days Vilvain was esteemed a very good poet, orator, and disputant, and, in his elder, as eminent for divinity as his proper faculty,’ but in the prime of his life he neglected to produce anything, and his writings are ‘nothing but scraps, whimseys, and dotages of old age’ (Wood, Athenæ Oxon., ed. Bliss, iii. 631–3). These are: \n\n‘A Compend of Chronography,’ 1654.\n‘Enchiridium Epigrammatum Latino-Anglicum. An epitome of essais, Englished out of Latin. Six classes or centuries, beside a Fardel of 76 fragments,’ 1654.\n‘Theoremata Theologica,’ 1654. All three bear the same imprint and date, but from manuscript notes on the copies at the British Museum it would seem that Nos. 1 and 3 came out on 28 Dec. 1656, and the other on 3 Sept. 1655. The ‘Theoremata’ was reissued with a new title-page in 1663. He also published:\n‘A short survey of our Julian English year, with the definition, deviation, dimension, and manner of Reformation,’ in a single undated sheet (Wood, ib.)\nFuller, when at Exeter, was much gratified by some ‘uncommon manuscripts in Vilvain's library, with a museum of natural curiosities besides’ (Biogr. Brit. 1750, pp. 2056–7; cf. Fuller, History of Cambridge, p. 28).\nVilvain's benefactions to his native city and his college were numerous and costly. He gave 20l. towards the cost of the new buildings at Exeter College about 1624, and he founded at the college in 1637 four exhibitions of 32l. each per annum, to be paid through the rector and sub-rector. For the free school at St. John's Hospital, Exeter, he gave a tenement in Paris Street without the east-gate of Exeter, and he erected new buildings within the hospital at a cost of about 600l.\nOn Vilvain's motion the corporation of Exeter in December 1657 allowed the lady-chapel in the cathedral to be fitted up as a library, and the valuable collection of books then at St. John's Hospital, which had previously formed the cathedral library, to be moved thither. Vilvain defrayed the cost of the alterations in the lady-chapel, and the care of the library was entrusted to him. The books remained in this place until 1820.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Courtney, William Prideaux (1899). \"Vilvain, Robert\".

Nelson also appeared as Jim from Huckleberry Finn on both radio and television, and, alongside Sammy Davis Jr. and a mostly African American cast, in Aaron Spelling's groundbreaking 10th Cavalry-themed TV western, Mission.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nA native of Franklin, Texas, the older of two sons born to John Nelson and Dove Biggers, Nelson ran away from home at the age of 13, joining the J. R. Roberton Circus as a dancer, performing the Charleston and Black Bottom. From 1937 through 1940 and again from 1945 through 1948, he appeared with the Laguna Beach Festival of the Arts, portraying painter Elihu Vedder's \"African Sentinel.\" In the interim, he served with the United States Army for 3½ years during World War II, in China, India, and Burma, and was awarded the Purple Heart in 1945.In 1949, Nelson became the first African American graduate of CBS's radio drama school. The following year, he appeared as Jim—alongside Dean Stockwell's Huck and Jerry Farber's Tom—on NBC University Theater, in Ernest Kinoy's adaptation of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He also appeared that year on TV in Your Show Time's adaptation of Bret Harte's short story, \"Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff,\" and onstage in a revival of the Broadway musical Carmen Jones, staged at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Personal life and Death ==\nOn June 3, 1948, the California Eagle reported that Nelson was residing in Laurel Canyon with his \"pretty blue eyed wife.\" As of 1950, however, his United States Census form lists him as single (albeit \"room[ing]\" with a female head of household), and a 1953 profile in the Los Angeles Sentinel refers to him as \"a bachelor.\"On February 17, 1998, Nelson died of undisclosed causes. His remains are interred at Riverside National Cemetery. His gravestone, while citing Nelson's service in World War II, makes no mention of surviving relatives.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Welcome, Friend\".

        "content": "Tshosa was a regent of the Kwena tribe from 1803 to 1807. He became regent following the death of his brother Maleke, who was also a regent, and he held the position until he passed it to the Kwena heir, his nephew Motswasele II. After Motswasele's death, Tshosa led a group of the fractured Kwena tribe. He was killed in an attack by the Bakololo.\n\n\n== Life ==\nTshosa was a son of the Kwena kgosi Seitlhamo, born in the third house, and he was the junior brother of Legwale and Maleke. When Legwale became kgosi, he initiated a raid against another tribe. Tshosa opposed the action, and he allegedly gave the tribe advance warning. Legwale was killed in the raid, and Maleke became regent.\nTshosa became regent in 1803, taking on the role after the death of Maleke. While he was regent of the Bakwena, Tshosa was responsible for defending the tribe from two raids by the Bangwaketse, first in Mantsho and then in Kgomphata. Toward the end of his tenure, Tshosa moved the Kwena tribe from Dithejane to Shokwane. Tshosa's regency ended in 1807 when he passed the role of chief to his nephew and the next in line, Motswasele II. Tshosa's son Moruakgomo disagreed with this decision, desiring the role for himself.\nThe Kwena tribe fractured after Motswasele's death, and Tshosa led one faction to Borithe, Molepolole, and then Dithubaruba. He successfully defended Molepolole from a raid by the Bangwaketse, who sought to avenge their previous defeats. Tshosa made peace with the Bangwaketse to defend against an invasion by Sebetwane and his Kololo tribe in 1824, but he then fled Dithubaruba and allowed the Bangwaketse to be defeated. From here, he travelled to Lehututu and Lake Ngami. After returning to the land of the Kwena, he reunited his faction with that of Motswasele's son, Sechele I, and they went to Diruthe. Once they settled in Diruthe, the Kwena came into conflict with the Ngwato tribe. The Bangwato aligned with the Bakololo, who then killed Tshosa and Moruakgomo in a raid. Tshosa's wife took their younger son Kgakge to live with the Bangwaketse.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMorton, Fred (4 July 2017). \"To Die For: Inherited Leadership ( Bogosi ) Among the Tswana Before 1885\".

He was the son of John Whitehead, who had a wide reputation in the district as a herbalist and dealer in simples. James, after working as a boy in a cotton-mill, attended the Marsden Street school of medicine in Manchester, and was a pupil first of Mr. Clough of Lever Street, and afterwards of Mr. Lambert of Thirsk. He was admitted a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries of London on 11 September 1834, and on 15 December 1835 he became a member of the College of Surgeons. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Surgeons after examination on 14 August 1845. He graduated M.D. at the university of St. Andrews in 1850, and he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1859.\nWhitehead visited France and Germany in 1836, and on his return to England in 1838 he began to practise his profession in Oxford Street, Manchester. In 1842 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at the Marsden Street school of medicine, and in the same year he married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hayward Radcliffe, who died on 20 Sept. 1844. In 1856 he founded, jointly with Dr. Schoepf Merei, the Clinical Hospital and Dispensary for Children, which became subsequently the Manchester Clinical Hospital for Women and Children. He was lecturer on obstetrics at the Royal School of Medicine, and for fifteen years he acted as surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital for Women and Children. In 1851 he moved into Mosley Street, where he conducted a large practice until 1881, when he retired to live on an estate he had purchased at Sutton in Surrey. He died, after a long illness, on 9 April 1885, and is buried in the Ardwick cemetery, Manchester.\nWhitehead's works were: \n\n‘On the Causes and Treatment of Abortion and Sterility,’ London, 1847, 8vo; republished in America, 1848.\n‘On the Transmission from Parent to Offspring of some Forms of Disease,’ London, 1851, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1857.\n‘The Wife's Domain, by Philothalos,’ 1860, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1874.\n‘Notes on the Rate of Mortality in Manchester,’ 1863, 8vo.\nJointly with Dr. Merei, a report on children's diseases, being the first ‘Report of the Clinical Hospital,’ Manchester, 1856, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1900). \"Whitehead, James\".

        "content": "William Henry Williams (1771 – 8 November 1841) was an English physician and author.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWilliams was the son of Richard Williams. He was born at Dursley in Gloucestershire in 1771. He received his medical education at the Bristol Infirmary and at St. Thomas's and Guy's hospitals. He became a surgeon to the East Norfolk militia, and as such saw much home service. In 1795, when the regiment was encamped near Deal Castle, he was appointed the senior of a number of surgeons to whom was deputed the charge of several hundred Russian sailors suffering from malignant fever and dysentery. About 1797 he designed a tourniquet of such simplicity and efficiency that it was at once adopted by the authorities and named ‘Williams's Field Tourniquet’ by the army medical board in the printed directions for its use. It was ordered by the commander-in-chief, the Duke of York, that it should be employed in every regiment of the king's service, and that non-commissioned officers and musicians should be instructed in its use. In 1798 he entered himself at Caius College, Cambridge, and as a member of that house proceeded M.B. in 1803 and M.D. on 12 September 1811. Some years before this Williams had settled at Ipswich, and in 1810 was appointed by Sir Lucas Pepys, the physician-general of the army, to the charge of the South Military Hospital, close by Ipswich, then filled with soldiers just returned from Walcheren, and suffering with fever, ague, and dysentery. On the completion of his service there he received a flattering letter from the army medical board. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1816, and a fellow on 30 September 1817. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society. He continued to reside at Ipswich, but he died at Sandgate in Kent, whither he had gone for the benefit of his health, on 8 November 1841.\nWilliams's principal works were: \n\n‘Hints on the Ventilation of Army Hospitals and on Regimental Practice,’ 1798, 8vo.\n‘A Concise Treatise on the Progress of Medicine since the year 1573,’ 1804, 8vo.\n‘General Directions for the Recovery of Persons apparently dead from Drowning,’ 1808, 12mo.\n‘Pharmacopœia Valetudinarii Gippovicensis,’ 1814, 12mo.\n‘A Plain and Brief Sketch of Cholera, with a Simple and Economical Mode for its Treatment,’ 2nd edit., revised and enlarged, Ipswich, 1832, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1900). \"Williams, William Henry\".

        "content": "Melvin E. Wheatley (May 7, 1915 – March 1, 2009) was a bishop best known for appointing the first openly gay pastor in the United Methodist Church.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nWheatley was born in Lewisville, Pennsylvania, the son and grandson of Methodist ministers.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nWheatley was a well-rounded and popular honor student at American University in Washington, DC with a major in religion. In his senior year not only was he president of the Student Council, but president of the Student Christian Association, and captain of the basketball team.He went on to earn a divinity degree at Drew University in New Jersey.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nWhile at Drew, Wheatley served as an assistant instructor in the department of Biblical literature. He also taught philosophy for one semester at Modesto Junior College.After graduating from Drew in 1939, Wheatley's first pulpit assignment was in Lincoln, Delaware. Three years later, he served as associate pastor of First Methodist Church in Fresno, California.\n\n\n=== Lifelong supporter of diversity and inclusion ===\nDuring World War II, while in Fresno, he raised eyebrows, when he moved into the home of a Japanese family that had been sent to an internment camp in order to prevent their place from being vandalized.In 1964, while serving as pastor of the Westwood United Methodist Church near the campus of UCLA, he exchanged pulpits with Rev. L.L. White of Holman in the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles, a Methodist church with a predominantly Black congregation.In 1972, Wheatley was appointed a bishop of the United Methodist Church. The same year, the Church took its first official stand against homosexuality. At the Church's 1980 General Conference he was the only bishop that refused to sign a statement condemning homosexuality.In 1981, Julian Rush, an associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in Boulder, Colorado, was under fire when he came out as gay. Wheatley, who was the bishop of the Rocky Mountain Conference which includes the entire state of Colorado, hoped that a compromise could be reached that would allow Rush to stay at his post.When an agreement could not be reached with First Methodist, in a controversial move, Wheatley assigned Rush to the St. Paul United Methodist Church in Denver, which had a significant number of openly gay congregants. This was the first time that a United Methodist bishop appointed an openly gay pastor. Prior to the appointment, Wheatley wrote a letter to all of the ministers in the Conference in support of Rush which included the following statement:\n\nHomosexuality quite like heterosexuality is neither a virtue nor an accomplishment. Homosexual orientation is a mysterious gift of God's grace communicated through an exceedingly complex set of chemical, biological, chromosomal, hormonal, environmental, developmental factors totally outside my homosexual friends' control. Their homosexuality is a gift, neither a virtue nor a sin. What they do with their homosexuality, however, is definitely their personal, moral and spiritual responsibility. Their behavior as homosexuals may be very sinful---brutal, exploitive, selfish, promiscuous, superficial. Their behavior as homosexuals, on the other hand, may be beautiful---tender, considerate, loyal, other-centered, profound.\nIn 1984, Wheatley retired to Laguna Woods in Orange County, California.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nHe married Lucile Maris in June 1939. His wife was a vocalist that sang with various church choirs. This union produced three sons. His son John came out as gay to the family in 1973.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nWheatley died March 1, 2009, in Mission Viejo, California, after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, sons Paul and James, and three grandchildren. John died of melanoma in 1984.“So many gay men and women who have been ministers in the church were in essence thrown under the bus. He kept that from happening to me,” Rush, who remained a minister in good standing, told The Los Angeles Times shortly after Wheatley's death. “He really pushed the bishops in the church to start reevaluating. There has been a huge upheaval since then, which has been very healthy.”\n\n\n=== See also ===\nPaul AbelsHomosexuality and MethodismGene LeggettLGBT-affirming religious groupsKaren OlivetoReconciling Ministries NetworkJulian Rush\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The QW-2 (NATO reporting name: CH-SA-8) is a Chinese man-portable infrared homing surface-to-air missile (SAM) MANPADS. The system has improved performance against targets flying faster and at lower-altitude than the QW-1.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Qian Wei-2 (or Vanguard 2, in its export designation) is the third generation of man-portable missiles built by the Shenyang firm Hangtian Xinle Ltd. It is difficult to determine exactly when it was put into service, but it probably came into operation between 1998 and 2002. The QW-2 was first revealed in 1998 at the Farnborough Airshow. The missile and its launcher closely resemble those of the Russian 9K310 “Igla-1” system (NATO designation: SA-16 “Gimlet”), and the two systems are considered to be quite comparable in terms of performance and capabilities.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== QW-2 ===\nThe QW-2 is considered by many Chinese media as the Asian equivalent of the AmericanFIM-92E.  It is a further development of the QW-1, the first series of Vanguard missiles.\nCompared to the QW-1, the minimum operational altitude of the QW-2 was reduced from 30 m to 10 m, the maximum range was increased from 5000 m to 6000 m, and the missile reaction time was reduced to less than 5 seconds. It is also equipped with a new dual-band passive infrared seeker, providing good resistance to thermal decoys (flares) and parasitic heat sources from the terrain (sun, ground, etc.), while  by making it possible to improve the missile's performance in bad weather conditions and at night. It subsequently appeared that an infrared imaging seeker had been substituted.\n\nAdditional data:\nMaximum target speed: 400 m/s approaching, 320 m/s moving away.\nOperating temperatures: −40 °C to +55 °C.\n\n\n=== CQW-2 ===\nThe prefix \"C\" here indicates that this is a version of the QW-2 that is mounted on a 4x4 vehicle (from Chinese \"Che-Zai\", \"vehicle-mounted\").\nIt is served by a crew of 3 men (driver, gunner and gunner) and the fire control is made up of an acquisition radar and optronic tracking equipment.  Once the target is acquired on radar, guidance returns to the optronic system, which is responsible for tracking and engagement.  The on-board system allows the use of missiles one by one or in pairs, and the vehicle has 8 missiles ready for firing in the turret supports. 8 other projectiles are in the hold.\nThe fire control is mounted in a ball, which includes a thermal camera and a laser rangefinder. Its radar is a variant of the NRIET AS-90, which operates in L-band and ranges to 20 km.  The system reaction time is less than 8 seconds.\nThe CQW-2 missiles are fully interchangeable with the QW-2 portable launcher system.  However, this operation cannot be carried out in the field.\n\n\n=== QW-12 ===\n\nUses a laser proximity detonator. \nUnveiled in November 2014.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n\n Algeria: Produced locally under license since 2010.\n Bangladesh\nBangladesh Army\n China\nPeople's Liberation Army\n Iran\nIranian Armed Forces\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Henry Wakley (21 March 1821 – 5 April 1907) was an English surgeon and journalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWakley was the eldest son of Thomas Wakley. He was born in London on 21 March 1821. With a view to taking holy orders, he was educated, preparatory to matriculation at Oxford, by a private tutor, the Rev. James Basnett Mills, a son of a partner in the printing firm Mills & Jowett, who printed the 'Lancet' in its early days. Wakley resided in Oxford for a short time without matriculating; as the son of a prominent radical, he probably found the atmosphere uncongenial. Then entering the University of London, he took up medicine at University College. Among his teachers were Samuel Cooper, Robert Liston, Richard Quain, and Erasmus Wilson; the last named coached him privately. Continuing his medical studies in Paris, he there not only attended surgical lectures and clinics, but also devoted much time to music and singing under Garcia and Ronconi. In 1845 he became M.R.C.S., and in 1848 was elected assistant surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital. Taking a house in Guilford Street near the hospital, he filled the position of an informal casualty surgeon. As a young untried man, nearly all of whose studies had been pursued abroad, he incurred the hostility of his father's enemies, who held his appointment to be a breach of principles of hospital administration which his father's newspaper, the 'Lancet,' was vigorously upholding against abuses. Wakley was accused of malpraxis in treating a child for fracture complicated with scarlet fever, and an action was brought against him. In spite of the mental strain, he passed the examination for the fellowship of the College of Surgeons on 6 December 1849, four days before the trial came on. The jury found a verdict for Wakley without leaving the box. Wakley soon moved to No. 7 Arlington Street, where for many years he practised as a consulting surgeon. As a surgeon his name is chiefly associated with the invention of a form of urethral dilator and with the use of glycerine in the treatment of affections of the external auditory canal (cf. Clinical Reports on the Use of Glycerine, ed. W. T. Robertson, 1851).\nIn 1857 his father made him and his youngest brother, James Goodchild Wakley, part proprietors of the 'Lancet,' with a share in the management. In 1862 the father died. The youngest son, James, became editor, while Thomas maintained an active interest in its conduct. Until 1882, when he retired from practice, he pursued the double occupation of consulting surgeon and journalist. Upon the death of James Wakley in 1886 he assumed the editorship in association with his son Thomas. Thenceforth, until near his death, he devoted himself to his journalistic duties. Although he lacked the training of a journalist, he was a practical and shrewd editor, and maintained the position of the paper. The active management devolved in course of time on his son, but Wakley always kept in his own hands the 'Lancet' relief fund to meet accidental distresses of medical practitioners and their families, which he and his son founded and financed from 1889. To the last he helped to direct the Hospital Sunday Fund, which had been virtually founded by his brother. He manifested his interest in Epsom College for the sons of medical men by a donation in 1902 of 1000l. in the name of the proprietors of the 'Lancet.'\nWakley's energy was unbounded. When young he was a fine runner; he hunted until late in life, was a good shot, and fond of fishing. He died on 5 April 1907 of cardiac failure and senile decay, his last illness being practically his first. Wakley married in 1850 Harriette Anne, third daughter of Francis Radford Blake of Rickmansworth. She survived him, with a son, Thomas [see infra], and a daughter, Amy Florence.\nWakley wrote little. An article on diseases of the joints in Samuel Cooper's 'Dictionary of Practical Surgery' (new ed. revised by S. A. Lane, 1872) is the most important of his publications.\nWakley's only son, Thomas Wakley (1851–1909), born in London on 10 July 1851, was educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied medicine but took no degree. After he left Cambridge a serious bicycle accident interrupted his medical studies for some six years, but having entered St. Thomas's Hospital he became L.R.C.P. in 1883. Thenceforth he worked in the 'Lancet' office, first as assistant to his uncle, James Wakley, then as editor, later on his uncle's death in 1886 as joint-editor with his father, and finally as sole editor in succession to his father. A good amateur actor, a prominent freemason, and a numismatist, he died on 5 March 1909 of a gradually progressive hepatitis. He married in 1903 Gladys Muriel, daughter of Mr. Norman Barron, by whom he left one son, Thomas.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cholmeley, Henry Patrick (1912). \"Wakley, Thomas Henry\".

        "content": "George Wallis (1740 – 29 January 1802) was an English physician and author.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWallis was born at York in 1740. He studied medicine, and, after gaining the degree of M.D., obtained a large practice at York. He was much attached to theatrical amusements, and besides other pieces composed a mock tragedy entitled ‘Alexander and Statira,’ which was acted at York, Leeds, and Edinburgh. In 1775 a dramatic satire by him, entitled ‘The Mercantile Lovers,’ was acted at York. The play possessed merit enough for success, but it sketched too plainly the foibles of prominent citizens of the town. Through their resentment Wallis lost his entire medical practice, and was obliged to remove to London, where an expurgated edition of the play appeared in the same year. In London he commenced as a lecturer on the theory and practice of physic, and in 1778 published an ‘Essay on the Evil Consequences attending Injudicious Bleeding in Pregnancy’ (London, 1781, 2nd edit. 8vo). He died in London, at Red Lion Square, on 29 January 1802.\nBesides the works mentioned, he was the author of:\n\n‘The Juvenaliad,’ a satire, 1774, 4to.\n‘Perjury,’ a satire, 1774, 4to.\n‘Nosologia Methodica Oculorum, or a Treatise on the Diseases of the Eyes, translated and selected from the Latin of Francis Bossier de Sauvages,’ London, 1785, 8vo.\n‘The Art of preventing Diseases and restoring Health,’ London, 1793; 2nd edit. 1796; German translation, Berlin, 1800.\n‘An Essay on the Gout,’ London, 1798, 8vo.\nHe edited the ‘Works of Thomas Sydenham on Acute and Chronic Diseases,’ London, 1789, 2 vols. 8vo, and the third edition of George Motherby's ‘Medical Dictionary,’ London, 1791, fol.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Henderson, Thomas Finlayson (1886). \"Wallis, George (1740-1802)\".

        "content": "John Taylor Warren (1771 – 6 October 1849) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWarren was born in 1771. He was the son of Thomas Warren of Dunstable, Bedfordshire. He entered Merchant Taylors' school in 1780, and afterwards studied medicine at St. George's Hospital, where he became a favourite pupil of the great surgeon, John Hunter. At the outbreak of war at the French revolution, Warren was appointed assistant surgeon in the 20th dragoons, a regiment raised for service in Jamaica. After serving in that island for some time he was ordered to St. Domingo. There he was appointed surgeon of Keppel's black regiment, but before joining, owing to the mortality among European officers, he was nominated surgeon to the 23rd infantry or Welsh fusiliers, and thence was promoted to the post of staff surgeon to the forces. In 1797 he returned to England with invalids, and, having distinguished himself by his activity and skill, he was placed at the recruiting depôt in Chatham barracks, subsequently at Gosport, and finally in the Isle of Wight, where he gained the friendship of Sir George Hewett, the commander of the forces stationed there.\nIn 1805 Warren was appointed deputy-inspector of military hospitals, and was placed in charge of the home department. In 1808 he proceeded to Spain with a detachment of English troops, and, after being present at Vimiero, accompanied Sir John Moore on his expedition. When the troops embarked at Coruña he was placed in charge of the wounded, and was the last English officer to leave the shore. In 1816 he was appointed inspector-general of hospitals, succeeding his friend James Borland in the Mediterranean station. He retired from the regular service in 1820. He acted for many years as vice-president of the Army Medical Benevolent Society for Orphans, and as trustee of the Society for the Widows of Medical Officers. In 1843, in recognition of his services, a silver vase was presented him by his brother officers and friends. He died on 6 October 1849 at his house on the Marine Parade, Brighton, and was buried in the family vault at South Warnborough, Hampshire, where his brother, Thomas Alston Warren, was rector. In 1800 he married Amelia, daughter of the Chevalier Ruspini. She survived him, leaving an only daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1899). \"Warren, John Taylor\".

        "content": "On 31 March 2024, a Boeing 727-200 operated by Safe Air Company scheduled to fly from Juba International Airport to Malakal Airport, South Sudan, undershot the runway after experiencing technical issues. The plane collided into a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 that had crashed around two months earlier in the same airport. Out of the seven occupants on board, everyone survived with only one injured.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 9 February 2024, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 operated by African Express Airways, crashed in similar circumstances as the Safe Air Boeing 727 did at Malakal Airport, South Sudan. Touching down short of the runway before losing its landing gear, and coming to a stop on its belly. It was later removed from the runway for the airport to restart operations again.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe first aircraft involved in the collision was a 45-year-old Boeing 727-2Q9 Advanced registered as 5Y-IRE with serial numbers 21931/1531. It was first delivered to Avianca in 1979.\nThe aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17R S3 engines.\nThe second aircraft involved was a 39-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-82 registered 5Y-AXL with serial numbers 49204/1179. It was first delivered to Alitalia in 1985.         \nThe aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-217A/C engines. \n\n\n== Accident ==\nOn 31 March 2024, the Boeing 727-200 took off from Juba Airport carrying supplies and other cargo. After an hour, they finished cruising and were descending when they started to experience technical problems with the aircraft. They decided to make an emergency landing, performed by the captain. Upon approach, the plane touched down a few meters off of the runway, causing the tires to burst. The captain lost control of the aircraft, sending it hurdling off of the runway, and finally striking the previously mentioned McDonnel Douglas MD-82 that was off of the runway. It sustained substantial damage, while the Boeing 727 split into two parts, thus being written off. There were no fatalities and one reported injury.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nAn investigation is currently ongoing to try to figure out why the aircraft crashed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Windet (died 20 November 1664) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWindet erroneously said to have been originally of Queen's College, Oxford (Foster). He graduated M.D. at Leyden on 26 June 1655, and was incorporated at Oxford on 27 March 1656. He became candidate or member of the College of Physicians of London on 25 June 1656. He at first practised at Yarmouth, but after 1656 in London. In 1660 he published in London two Latin poems, ‘Ad majestatem Caroli secundi Sylvæ duæ.’ The first begins with the word ‘occidimus,’ and is on the execution of Charles I; the second begins with the word ‘vivimus,’ and is on the Restoration. In 1663 he published ‘De vita functorum statu,’ a long Latin letter, with numerous passages in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, addressed to Dr. Samuel Hall, in reply to a letter from him. It begins with a general discussion of the word ‘Tartarus’ and of the Greek and Hebrew words and phrases used in describing the state of man after death, and goes on to consider the Greek and Hebrew views on the state and place of the good, on a middle state, and on the place of the wicked with related subjects. A second edition was published at Rotterdam in 1693. He was a friend of Sir Thomas Browne. Simon Wilkin, who had examined Windet's letters to Browne, states that they are uninteresting and pedantic. He died in Milk Street, London, on 20 November 1664 (Smyth, Obituary, p. 62). Wood (Fasti Oxon. ii. 790) states that he left a quarto manuscript of Latin poems.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1900). \"Windet, James\".

        "content": "Stanley Shaftel was an American architect, real estate developer, professor, and veteran of the United States Navy best known for his work throughout the New York metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Biography and career ==\nStanley Shaftel was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 14, 1924. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, and he joined the United States Navy after graduating, serving as a Naval pilot from 1942 to 1943. He began practicing architecture in New York City soon thereafter, having graduated from Oklahoma A&M College with a degree win architecture. He began his own architectural practice in 1952 and eventually moved his office to 310 Northern Boulevard, in the University Gardens section of Great Neck, New York.\nAs an architect, Shaftel mainly specialized in designing houses for large-scale suburban housing developments and in custom-built homes, working on projects in 16 states. Many of his works were noted for their modern design features, and a number of his higher-end homes were further included for their indoor swimming pools. A number of his earlier homes were collaborations between him and his first wife, Betty: he would design the house and she would decorate the interiors.\nIn the mid-1950s, shortly after opening his own practice, Shaftel undertook one of his first large-scale projects, designing 60 ranch and split-level homes in a 27-acre (11 ha) development in Roslyn Estates, New York. He would then design the houses in the 150-home Laurel Ridge development in Port Jefferson, New York, three years later, in 1957. In 1958, he would design the homes in the Suburban Greens development in Plainview, New York. In 1959, he designed houses in the 410-home Avalon Gardens development in Merrick, New York. That same year, he designed the houses in the 2,400-home North Point development in Huntington, New York – the largest housing development built on Long Island, at the time, since Levitt & Sons developed Levittown.\nIn the 1960s, Shaftel continued to design homes for countless large-scale suburban developments. He designed 60 homes for the Shaker Ridge development in Commack, New York, and 100 homes in 1963 for the Eastwood Knolls development in East Northport, New York. In the mid-1960s, Shaftel designed the homes for the Stratford Woods development in Flower Hill, New York; he also most homes in that village's Wildwood housing development – with some of the others being designed by others, such as A.H. Salkowitz.\nAnother architect, Alfred Akner, would eventually begin working with Shaftel, with the firm becoming Shaftel & Akner.\nIn the mid-1980s, Shaftel designed the houses in the 42-home Greentree at Whispering Fields development in Northport, New York. He designed three variants of homes for the development: a colonial variant (known as the \"Red Maple\"), a country ranch variant (known as the \"White Birch\"), and a contemporary variant (known as the Blue Spruce\"). One of these homes – the development's model home – would eventually be purchased and become a group home for people with autism and other developmental disabilities.\nShaftel also served as a professor of architecture at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, New York.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nStanley Shaftel died on December 26, 2003, aged 79.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nStanley Shaftel was married twice. He was married to his second wife, Corrine, for 47 years, until his death; they resided in Las Vegas at the time of his death, having previously lived in Kings Point, New York. They had three daughters and several grandchildren.\n\n\n== Notable work ==\nChun King Inn, Flushing, New York (1964)\n\n\n== See also ==\nManoug Exerjian\nFrank Genese\nHenry Johanson\nStanley H.

        "content": "The Washington Secondary is a freight-only railway line in the state of New Jersey. It runs 24.3 miles (39.1 km) from Phillipsburg, New Jersey, to Hackettstown, New Jersey. It forms a connection between the Lehigh Line and Morristown Line.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe modern Washington Secondary incorporates the western end of the former main line of the Morris and Essex Railroad. The Morris and Essex Railroad was incorporated in 1835, and began operating between Newark and Morristown in 1838. The line reached Hackettstown in 1854. The extension from Hackettstown to Phillipsburg opened in 1866. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad leased the Morris and Essex on January 1, 1869.\nUnder the Lackawanna, the section between Hackettstown and Washington was incorporated into the main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York, while the western part between Washington and Phillipsburg was known as the Phillipsburg branch. The Lackawanna completed the Lackawanna Cut-Off in 1911, bypassing the original main line in New Jersey and shortening the route between Port Morris Junction and Slateford Junction by 11 miles (18 km). The superseded line became known as the Lackawanna Old Road.\nThe Lackawanna and the Erie Railroad merged in 1960 to become the Erie Lackawanna Railroad (later the Erie Lackawanna Railway). Both lines were conveyed to Conrail in 1976 on the bankruptcy of the Erie Lackawanna; the line east of Washington was known as the Washington Line at this time. In 1994, NJ Transit extended Boonton Line service from Netcong to Hackettstown. NJ Transit leased that portion of the Washington Secondary from Conrail at that time. When Conrail was split between CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999, the Washington Secondary was conveyed to Norfolk Southern. NJ Transit acquired the Hackettstown–Netcong segment from Norfolk Southern in 2023, truncating the Washington Secondary to Phillipsburg–Hackettstown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nInterstate Commerce Commission (1932). \"Interstate Commerce Commission Reports: Decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States.

        "content": "The Château de Chaillot (also known as Maison de Beauregard or Hermitage de Chaillot) is an ancient château located near the site of the present-day Palais de Chaillot in Paris. It was purchased in 1651 by the nuns of the Visitation de Chaillot and was destroyed in 1794.\n\n\n== Manor house ==\nIn the Middle Ages, the former manor house of Chaillot, on the corner of rue de Chaillot and avenue Marceau, belonged to the Arrode family of Parisian bourgeoisie.\nNicolas Arrode, provost of Paris in 1217, gave his name to an old Parisian street, part of today's rue Montorgueil. This manor house was marked by a square tower, shown on Saint-Victor's 1552 map of Paris. This tower, absent from depictions of Chaillot in the following century, seems to have disappeared thereafter. Next to the church of Saint-Pierre, this plan shows an otherwise unidentified château. This manor house is different from the one on the Chaillot Hill, roughly where the Palais de Chaillot stands today, which belonged to the nuns of the Visitation de Sainte-Marie in the 17th century along with the fiefdom  of Chaillot.\n\n\n== Château on Chaillot Hill ==\nIn 1542, Hippolyte d'Este (Cardinal d'Este and Archbishop of Lyon) bought a building on the Chaillot Hill.\nIn 1583, Queen Catherine de Médicis bought this mansion or hermitage and the part of the estate of the convent of the Minimes de Chaillot located in the present-day gardens of the Trocadéro, extending to the northeast opposite the present-day Palais d'Iéna on rue Albert-de-Mun and the southwest between the present-day rue Le Tasse and avenue Albert-Ier-de-Monaco. The queen had a château built there, called \"Catherinemont\".\nThe ancient architect Étienne Dupérac was commissioned to design a U-shaped château with terraced gardens and a courtyard in the shape of a racecourse.\nHowever, the sovereign's enjoyment of the château was short-lived, as she died in 1589.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHenri de Navarre moved in during the siege of Paris in the summer of 1590.\nLike Marie de Médicis, Henri IV decided not to complete the work after the promulgation of the Edict of Nantes and the restoration of peace.\nThe property was acquired by Diane de Corisande, Countess de Guiche et de Gramont, a former mistress of Henri IV, and then in 1613 by President Jeannin, who made alterations.\nRichelieu moved in in 1629 during Louis XIII's stay at the Château de Madrid, across the Bois de Boulogne.\nIn 1630, Georges-Africain de Bassompierre bought it from Pierre Jeannin's daughter, leaving the usufruct to his brother, the Maréchal de Bassompierre, who embellished it. For his part in the conspiracy of Dupes Day, the Marshal was imprisoned in the Bastille from 1631 to 1643. During his imprisonment, the palace was requisitioned as a residence for the king's niece, the Duchesse de Nemours, and then again for Richelieu.\n\n\n== Visitandines convent ==\nWhen Maréchal de Bassompierre died in 1646, his penniless heirs decided to sell the estate. Henriette de France, the third daughter of Henri IV and widow of the executed King Charles I of England, a refugee in France since 1644 who wanted to live in a convent, chose Chaillot for the nuns of the Order of the Visitation, who bought the château, which the Bassompierres had bought for 80,000 livres, at auction on May 12, 1651, for 67,000 livres. Between 1687 and 1707, the nuns added a church. The buildings were destroyed by the Grenelle gunpowder factory explosion in 1794 after the nuns had left. To prepare the project palace of the King of Rome, the last remains were demolished in 1811.\n\n\n== Buildings and outbuildings ==\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in 1648 by the nephews of the Maréchal de Bassompierre, the property included three large courtyards, large buildings with several halls, kitchens, bedrooms, closets, two galleries, a chapel, stables, a gardener's house, and two pavilions. The whole complex stood on a walled estate of 30 arpents (about 15 hectares), including a park with staircases, ponds, fountains, forests, and a vegetable garden.\nIts boundaries were:\n\nThe Seine, the Minimes convent to the south.\nThe road from Chaillot to Saint-Cloud to the west.\nA plot of land in the village of Chaillot to the north, i.e. the gardens and the Place du Trocadéro.  A reservoir, filled by a pump drawing water from the Seine, fed the fountains in the gardens and the château.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCovent of the Visitandines de Chaillot\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOry, Pascal (2006).

It was opened on 18 March 2024, with the extension of M9 from Bahariye to Ataköy.\nThe station was originally designed to be a single station complex with the future M7 line station. When the M7 line extension was revised in 2021, it was decided that the connection between the stations would be abandoned and that the M7 station would be built with the shaft type. Another revision was made in 2023, which meant that this decision was abandoned and it was decided to build the M7 station in a tunnel type and connect it to the M9 station via a pedestrian underpass of approximately 130 meters.\n\n\n== Station layout ==\n\n\n== Operation information ==\nThe line operates between 06.00 - 00.00 and train frequency is 9 minutes.

        "content": "Anthony White (1782 – 9 March 1849) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhite was born in 1782 at Norton in Durham, a member of a family long resident in the county, was educated at Witton-le-Wear, and afterwards at Cambridge, where he graduated bachelor of medicine from Emmanuel College in 1804, having been admitted a pensioner on 18 May 1799. He was apprenticed to Sir Anthony Carlisle, and was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 September 1803. He was elected an assistant-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital on 24 July 1806, surgeon on 24 April 1823, and consulting surgeon on 23 December 1846. At the College of Surgeons he was elected a member of the council on 6 September 1827, and two years later, 10 September 1829, he was appointed a member of the court of examiners in succession to William Wadd. In 1831 he delivered the Hunterian oration (unpublished), and he became vice-president in 1832 and again in 1840, serving the office of president in 1834 and 1842. He also filled the office of surgeon to the Royal Society of Musicians.\nWhite suffered severely from gout in his later years, and died at his house in Parliament Street on 9 March 1849. As a surgeon he is remarkable because he was the first to excise the head of the femur for disease of the hip-joint, a proceeding then considered to be so heroic that Sir Anthony Carlisle and Sir William Blizard threatened to report him to the College of Surgeons. He performed the operation with complete success, and sent the patient to call upon his opponents. His besetting sin was unpunctuality, and he often entirely forgot his appointments, yet he early acquired a large and lucrative practice.\nWhite published: \n\n‘Treatise on the Plague,’ &c., London, 1846, 8vo.\n‘An Enquiry into the Proximate Cause of Gout, and its Rational Treatment,’ London, 1848, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1848; American edit. New York, 1852, 8vo.\nA three-quarter-length portrait in oils by Thomas Francis Dicksee, engraved by William Walker, was published on 20 August 1852. A likeness by Simpson is in the board-room of the Westminster Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1900). \"White, Anthony\".

        "content": "The tomb of Soong Ching-ling is the mausoleum of Soong Ching-ling, the last wife of the founding father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen, and the honorary chairman of the People's Republic of China. It is located next to the tomb of Soong Ching-ling's parents in the Soong Ching-ling Mausoleum (formerly the International Cemetery) in Changning district, Shanghai. The tomb of Soong Ching-ling was completed in 1981 and was declared a national major cultural relic protection unit by the State Council on February 23, 1982.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSoong Ching-ling (January 27, 1893 - May 29, 1981) was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, honorary chairman of the People's Republic of China, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and chairman of the China Welfare Institute. She was born in Chuansha County, Songjiang Prefecture, Jiangsu Province (now Chuansha New Town, Pudong New Area, Shanghai).\nOn May 29, 1981, Soong Ching-ling passed away in Beijing. The government of the People's Republic of China organized a funeral committee to hold a state funeral for Soong Ching-ling and, following her will, buried her ashes in the Soong family grave in the Shanghai International Cemetery on the morning of June 4. Deng Yingchao, Wulanhu, Liao Chengzhi, Chen Muhua, and others escorted the remains from Beijing to Shanghai. Friends of Soong Ching-ling, consuls general of various countries in Shanghai, and major leaders of Shanghai attended the funeral.\nAfter the funeral, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the opinions of various sectors of society, partially renovated the Soong family cemetery in the International Cemetery, which was renamed the \"Soong Ching-ling Mausoleum of the People's Republic of China\" in 1984. On February 23, 1982, the State Council of the People's Republic of China announced the tomb of Soong Ching-ling as a national major cultural relic protection unit. In May 1986, a memorial stele commemorating Soong Ching-ling was erected in the Soong Ching-ling Mausoleum, with an inscription by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nSoong Ching-ling's tomb is located in the central north part of the Soong Ching-ling Memorial Park, on the east side of her parents' tomb. It covers an area of 263 square meters. The tombstone is made of lying granite, measuring 120 centimeters long and 60 centimeters wide. It is engraved with the words \"The tomb of Comrade Soong Ching-ling, Honorary Chairman of the People's Republic of China, born in 1893 and died in 1981, erected on June 4, 1981\". The font used is Liuyan.: 154  \nAt the south end of the tomb is a memorial square covering an area of 2880 square meters, capable of accommodating over 1000 people simultaneously. In the center north of the memorial square stands a Han white marble statue of Soong Ching-ling, 2.52 meters tall, mounted on a polished granite veneer base 1.1 meters high. Behind the tomb is a small hill planted with evergreen trees such as Chinese juniper, dragon juniper, and spruce. Surrounding the tomb are flowers loved by Soong Ching-ling during her lifetime, including lilacs, magnolias, crape myrtles, and azaleas. \nIn the center of the cemetery avenue stands the Soong Ching-ling monument, 3.3 meters high and 5 meters wide. On the front, Deng Xiaoping's inscription reads: \"Comrade Soong Ching-ling, the great warrior of patriotism, democracy, internationalism, and communism, will be immortalized forever\". On the back is an inscription in regular script with over 3300 characters in gold leaf, recording Soong Ching-ling's life and achievements.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nAfter Soong Ching-ling's passing, people from home and abroad visit Soong Ching-ling's tomb to commemorate her on her death anniversary and birthday. Relevant seminars are also held in the Soong Ching-ling Memorial Park. Additionally, local universities in Shanghai organize students to visit Soong Ching-ling's tomb for tomb-sweeping and other memorial activities around the Qingming Festival. Schools like Changning district Jianqing Experimental School organize students for \"summer practice activities\", during which students visit Soong Ching-ling's tomb. In December 2002, the management of the Soong Ching-ling Memorial Park carried out major renovations, including Soong Ching-ling's tomb, which were completed before the Qingming Festival in 2003.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSoong Ching-ling Memorial Residence (Shanghai)\nTomb of Xu Guangqi\nTomb of Lu Xun\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Schneider was calculated at 282.339 DM (equivalent to €561,952 in 2021) and in the Kaufhof, 390.865 DM (equivalent to €777,956 in 2021).\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter Benno Ohnesorg was shot by police chief  Karl-Heinz Kurras on 2 June 1967, in West-Berlin, part of the student movement became radicalized. Damage to property (“violence against property”) was discussed as a legitimate means of political protest.\nOn 22. May 1967, the À l’innovation department store burned in Brussels. Between 251 and 323 people died. This event inspired the Berlin Kommune 1 to produce leaflets in which, on the one hand, the human suffering was deplored, but it was also compared to the suffering of the people bombed with napalm during the Vietnam War.\nLeaflet No. 7 “Why are you targeting consumers?”\n[…] A burning department store with burning people conveyed, for the first time in a major European city, that crackling Vietnam feeling (of being there and burning along) that we have yet to miss in Berlin. […] As much as we sympathize with the pain of the bereaved in Brussels: we, who are open to the new, can, as long as the right measure is not exceeded, accept the bold and the unconventional, which, despite all the human tragedy, is in the Brussels department store fire , our admiration does not fail. […]Commune I (May 24, 1967)” A second leaflet with the same date was even more direct. The creators of the leaflets, previously known for egg throwing and pudding attacks, suggested, for example, that the population could also go to the department store and discreetly light a cigarette in the dressing room.\n\nLeaflet No. 8 “When will the Berlin department stores burn?\n[…] If there is a fire somewhere in the near future, if a barracks blows up somewhere, if the stands collapse in a stadium somewhere, please don’t be surprised. Just like when the Americans crossed the demarcation line, the bombing of the city center of Hanoi , and the Marines' invasion of China. Brussels gave us the only answer: Burn, warehouse, burn! \nCommune I (May 24, 1967)“Because of the leaflets, the Communards Rainer Langhans and Fritz Teufel were charged in the so-called “arson trial” but were acquitted.\n\n\n== The fires ==\nAndreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin met each other at the end of July 1967 through the extra-parliamentary opposition network in Berlin. On 7. August 1967 they jointly carried out a symbolic smoke bomb attack on the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.Baader, Ensslin and Proll picked up Söhnlein on 1. April 1968 in Munich and arrived in Frankfurt am Main early in the morning of 2. April. They scouted department stores all day long. Shortly before the M. Schneider und Kaufhof stores on the Zeil closed, they set home-made incendiary devices with  timed detonators that went off shortly before midnight. In the Kaufhof, part of the sporting goods and toy department burned, in Schneider's the wall of a changing room burned on the first floor, and a closet burned on the third floor. The damage caused by the incendiary devices was comparatively minor, but it triggered the sprinkler systems. Shortly before the incendiary devices were triggered, a woman called the Frankfurt office of the Deutschen Presse-Agentur and said:\n\n„ There will soon be a fire at Schneider and in the Kaufhof. It is a political act.” \n\n\n== Investigation and trial ==\nThe Frankfurt Kriminalpolizei quickly determined that arson had occurred because plastic bottles and travel alarm clocks were found at all three sources of the fire, the condition of which left no doubt as to the cause of the fire. As early as 3 April, the management of the department stores decided to offer a high reward. On the morning of 4 April, Frankfurt police received a firm tip that led to the arrest of the four arsonists in Bockenheim.\nThe trial began on 14 October 1968 at the Frankfurt am Main regional court and was turbulent. The defendants, who were defended by the lawyers Otto Schily, Horst Mahler, Klaus Eschen und Ernst Heinitz, initially behaved in a conspicuously good mood and mocked the judge and public prosecutor. A photo that became particularly well-known shows the four defendants in the dock, some of them with cigars in their mouths.On October 29, 1968, the Frankfurt public prosecutor Walter Griebel demanded six years in prison for each of the defendants. The scope ranged from criminal damage to property to particularly serious arson. The prosecutor referred to the night watchmen present and insisted that human lives had been endangered. It was claimed the entire city centre of Frankfurt was at risk of burning.\nThe Grand Criminal Chamber, chaired by the regional court director Gerhard Zoebe, only partially followed this ruling in its judgment of October 31, 1968 and imposed sentences of three years in prison for attempted arson that endangered people (§ 306 StGB). The defendants perceived the verdict as arbitrary by the state, even though the presiding judge acknowledged that they had “a certain political motivation” in the reasons for the verdict. The interpretation of the “political happening” as a simple crime was particularly disappointing for them. When Gudrun Ensslin was asked for a final word, she replied: “No. I don't want to give you the opportunity to give the impression that you are listening to me.\"“\n\n\n=== Commentary on the trial ===\n“It is in order that order defends itself against disorder, that the prevailing order defends itself against attempts to abolish it; anyone who disrupts the prevailing order must expect that it will strike if it can. That's why it was pointless to set fire to someone else's property on 2 April 1968; nothing else could be demonstrated with it. […] There are laws whose violation is less dangerous and yet more politically effective.” Uwe Nettelbeck, in Die Zeit, 8. November 1968.“It remains that what is being litigated in Frankfurt is a matter for which imitation - apart from the enormous danger to the perpetrators, because of the threat of severe punishment - cannot be recommended. But what Fritz Teufel said at the SDS delegate conference also remains: 'It is still better to set fire to a department store than to run a department store.' Fritz Teufel can sometimes formulate things really well.” Ulrike Meinhof in: konkret 14/1968.\n\n\n=== Unsuccessful appeal against the verdicts and escape ===\nThe defendants' lawyers filed an appeal. On 13 June 1969 - around 14 months after the arrest - further execution of the pre-trial arrest warrants was suspended; the defendants were bailed. On 10 November, the appeals were rejected. Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Thorwald Proll went into hiding and initially fled to Paris. Only Horst Söhnlein began his prison sentence. \nProll separated from Ensslin, and Baader in Paris in December 1969, and turned himself in to the Berlin-Moabit public prosecutor's office on 21 November 1970. He was released early from prison in October 1971. Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin returned to Berlin in February 1970. Andreas Baader was arrested there on 4 April 1970, following a tip from an informant, but was freed at gunpoint by Ulrike Meinhof and others on 14 May 1970, during an planned escape from the Tegel Prison. This action is considered the birth of the Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\n\n== Film ==\nThe arson attacks were the inspiration for the 1969 TV film Brandstifter, produced for WDR by Klaus Lemke, with Margarethe von Trotta and Iris Berben as the leading actresses.\nThe department store fires are also shown in the films The Baader Meinhof Complex and If Not Us, Who? (Wer wenn nicht wir).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAndreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Thorwald Proll, Horst Söhnlein: We do not defend ourselves from such a justice system.

The tournament took place in Perth from 6–13 April 2024.\nThe national teams of Australia and India will compete in a five-match test series.\nAustralia won the tournament, defeating India in all five matches for a 5–0 sweep of the series.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis was the fifth test series between Australia and India in 27 years. The last series was held in Adelaide, Australia in 2022, which ended in their 4–1 victory to Australia. India's last series win against Australia came in 2014, also in Perth. As per an initial memorandum of understanding between the two nations, the series was scheduled to be held in India, but was shifted to Australia, considering most FIH tournaments, including the following Hockey World Cup and the Olympic Games were to be held outside India.\nThe series was seen as preparation to India and Australia's Olympic Games campaign to be held later that year, where the two teams were drawn in the same group. India went to Australia on the back of five wins in a total of eight games earlier that year. The two teams faced off twice, both in the FIH Pro League, with Australia winning both matches; the first by a 6–4 margin, and the second by 3–0 on penalties after a 2–2 draw in regulation time. Australia entered the series in good form, winning seven out of their eight matches in 2024. The FIH Pro League was the last international tournament that the two teams featured in; the India-leg concluded in February that year. Australia also had a superior head-to-head record over India in the decade prior to the series. Since 2013, they had won 28 times, lost 8 and drawn 7 in the 43 games played against India. However, in the FIH World Ranking, they were ranked fifth, one below India.\nBefore flying to Australia, India's squad held a three-week preparatory camp in Bhubaneswar. India's head coach Craig Fulton stated that the tour was \"crucial\" in the team's preparation for the Olympics and added that \"Australia is the form team at the moment so it's always nice to test yourself against them.\"\n\n\n== Squads ==\nThe national squads were announced prior to the tournament:\n\n\n== Officials ==\nThe following umpires were appointed by Hockey Australia and the FIH to officiate the tournament:\n\n\n== Results ==\nAll times are local (AWST).\n\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n\n=== Fixtures ===\n\n\n== Goalscorers ==\nThere were 24 goals scored in 5 matches, for an average of 4.8 goals per match.\n7 goals\n\n3 goals\n\n2 goals\n\n1 goal\n\nSource: FIH\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHockey Australia",

        "content": "Hugh Smith (died 26 December 1790) was an English medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSmith was son of a surgeon and apothecary. He was born at Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and obtained the degree of M.D. on 22 April 1755. He at first practised in Essex, but came to London in 1759, and fixed his residence in Mincing Lane. In 1760 he commenced a course of lectures on the theory and practice of physic, which were numerously attended. These, together with the publication of ‘Essays on Circulation of the Blood, with Reflections on Blood-letting,’ 1761, gave him a wide reputation. In 1762 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1765 he was elected physician to Middlesex Hospital, and in 1770 was chosen alderman of the Tower ward, a dignity which his professional duties compelled him to resign in 1772. About this time he removed to Blackfriars and devoted himself chiefly to consulting practice at home. He was accustomed to give two days of the week to the poor, from whom he would take no fee. He also assisted some of his patients pecuniarily. In 1780 he purchased a country residence at Streatham in Surrey. He died at Stratford in Essex on 26 December 1790, and was buried in the church of West Ham. Besides the work mentioned above, he wrote ‘Formulæ Medicamentorum,’ London, 1772, 12mo. He must be distinguished from\nHugh Smith (1736?–1789), possibly his son. The latter graduated M.D. at Leyden on 11 November 1755, and practised at Hatton Garden, London. He married the daughter of Archibald Maclean, a lady of fortune, who inherited Trevor Park, East Barnet. He died, aged 53, on 6 June 1789, and was buried in East Barnet church. He was author of: \n\n‘The Family Physician,’ London, 1760, 4to; 5th edit. 1770.\n‘Letters to Married Women,’ 3rd edit.

        "content": "Lea Park Bridge is a truss bridge that crosses the North Saskatchewan River as part of Alberta Highway 897 in the County of Vermilion River near the community of Lea Park, Alberta. It is located approximately 21 kilometres (13 mi) from the Saskatchewan border between Marwayne and the Cree community of Frog Lake. The bridge is situated directly to the left of the mouth of the Vermilion River.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe bridge is made of 938 short tons (851 metric tons) of steel and 3,400 cubic yards (2,600 m3) of concrete. The design features five yellow trusses over a two lane road with a steel railing and concrete curb.  Underneath the bridge there are five concrete piers and two concrete abutments.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe current location of the Lea Park Bridge had long been used as a crossing point by early settlers due to its narrowness. Prior to the bridge being built the area was served by a ferry which was installed in 1908, which was originally just a scow, but was then updated to a cable ferry and finally adapted into a motor-powered ferry. By 1956 the total vehicle traffic on the bridge had grown to 22,287 vehicles; this along with the fact that the ferry closed during the spring and fall made the need for a bridge apparent to both locals and what was then known as the Alberta Department of Highways. Construction for the bridge started in May 1956 as a collaboration between the Department of Highways and Manczasz Construction. The construction involved the use of a crane and a cable car to transport materials. The opening ceremony of the bridge took place in 1958 and involved a parade featuring a marching band, cars used as parade floats and Mounties on horseback. By its completion, the bridge ended up costing $800,000 (upwards of $8,000,000 in today's money). Both the steel railing and the concrete curbs were replaced in 2011 and repairs on the bridge were done in 2013 and 2018. Over the years, the bridge has been the location of multiple accidents and a car chase.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Canada\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "The Voie des Fêtes and the voie navette of the Paris Métro are two single-track connecting tunnels between lines 3 bis at the Porte des Lilas station, and 7 bis at the Place des Fêtes and Pré-Saint-Gervais stations, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris.\nThe Voie des Fêtes takes its name from the station where it originates and it is on this track that we find the Haxo station ghost station, which was never opened to the public.\nThe Voie navette takes its name from a shuttle that ran between the termini of lines 3 and 7 (now 3 bis and 7 bis) from 1921 to 1939. During the 1950s, it served as a testing ground for the RATP, notably for the first tests of automatic piloting in 1951, and then for the world's first rubber-tired metro prototype, the MP 51, from 1952 to 1956.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe Voie des Fêtes breaks away shortly after the Place des Fêtes station on line 7 bis and runs under the rue du Pré-Saint-Gervais. After a curve to the southeast, it passes under the line 7 bis. It runs under Boulevard Sérurier, one of the Boulevards des Maréchaux in the east of the capital, then serves the ghostly Haxo station. It then joins the voie navette before serving the Porte des Lilas - Cinéma, a two-track station flanked by two side platforms.\nWith a length of 770 meters, the voie navette runs entirely under the Boulevard Sérurier. Also, with a difficult long, and flat profile, it has a tight curve with a radius of seventy-five meters and a ramp of 40 ‰ over three hundred meters.\nFrom the exit of the Porte des Lilas - Cinéma station, the two tracks merge into a short single track that connects to line 3 bis, on the track towards Gambetta.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n27 November 1921: inauguration of the Gambetta - Porte des Lilas section of line 3 and of the shuttle service between lines 3 and 7.\n3 September 1939: end of the shuttle service.\n13 April 1952 to 31 May 1956: Experiments with the MP 51.\n\n\n=== Linking lines 3 and 7 ===\n\nIn its deliberations of 14 June 1901, the Paris City Council expressed the wish to study a network complementary to the first lines built, so that, in principle, no part of the city would be more than four hundred meters from a metro station.\nFulgence Bienvenüe's project, presented on 4 December 1901, proposed several new lines and extensions, including line 3 from Gambetta to Porte de Romainville (Porte des Lilas). In addition to the terminus of line 3, a second station was built from which a double-track tunnel extended by two single-track tunnels connected to line 7 (now 7 bis), allowing the latter to operate to Porte des Lilas.\nOne of the two tracks connects to the Place des Fêtes station, the voie des Fêtes, with an intermediate one-way station, called Porte du Pré-Saint-Gervais in the project, since popularized as Haxo, just 100 m from the other station, also called Porte du Pré-Saint-Gervais in the project, and now Pré-Saint-Gervais. The other connects to the Pré-Saint-Gervais station, the voie navette. The planned extension, with the additional connection to line 7, is 2.157 kilometers long.\nWork was nearing completion on the eve of the World War I, during which it continued at a slow pace. The section was handed over to the CMP on 23 February 1920, but the latter did not build the extension immediately: it was waiting for the city's commitment to pay the necessary funds in anticipation of the new 1920 agreement. Final work resumed in December 1920.\n\n\n=== The navette ===\n\nThe idea of sending line 7 trains to Porte des Lilas was dropped from the original plans, as line 3 trains were more than sufficient for this service (line 11 did not exist then). However, to connect lines 3 and 7, a shuttle service was planned on the northern track of the line, now called the \"voie navette\", between Pré-Saint-Gervais and Porte des Lilas stations. The service would be operated with a single unit consisting of two 10.85-meter \"little Sprague\" power cars taken from line 2. The small capacity of this trainset was more than sufficient for the traffic to be handled.\nThe Voie des Fêtes and the Haxo station were rendered useless: the track was only used to park the trains of line 3, while the station was not completed and, in particular, had no access to the public highway.\nThe voie navette was inaugurated on 27 November 1921, with the extension of line 3, now line 3 bis. But this very short line ceased to operate with the introduction of the restricted service during the World War II, on 3 September 1939.\n\n\n=== Experimenting with rubber-tired metro systems ===\n\nAfter the war, the voie navette was not reopened for commercial service due to very low ridership. However, it was used for numerous RATP tests, including the first autopilot tests in 1951 and the world's first rubber-tired metro prototype, the MP 51, from 1952 to 1956.\n\nAfter the initial tests, the MP 51 appeared to the company's engineers to be completely reliable. As a result, it was used daily in passenger service on the voie navette from 1:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. from 13 April 1952 to 31 May 1956.\nThis was not a return to commercial service on this track, as service was suspended on days when the railcar was being overhauled. Traffic remains very low, consisting mainly of curious onlookers and schoolchildren. A passenger, often a child, is regularly invited to drive the metro: he or she engages the autopilot, which the RATP is also testing during these trials. Sensors are placed underneath the vehicle and receive a program sent by an alternating current spread by a wire placed on the track, drawing a Greek pattern with variable steps.\n\n\n== Reconversion ==\n\nAfter serving as a training track for metro drivers, first on iron and then on rubber tires, and for the introduction of new rolling stock, the voie navette to the north, near Pré-Saint-Gervais station, was converted into a reinforced inspection station, i.e. a small maintenance workshop for the MF 88 equipment on line 7 bis. The tunnel is partly used to park trains, with seven parking positions. In addition to a separation grid, the track still has its wooden tire tracks from the MP 51 trials.\nSouthward, Porte des Lilas station on the voie navette and the voie des Fêtes has an unusual role.  Unused for commercial service since 1939, except for the temporary reopening of one of the station's two platforms for MP 51 passenger service from 1952 to 1956, it has been transformed into a film set for advertising and cinema, hence its current name, Porte des Lilas - Cinéma.\nFilming in metro stations open to the public is very restrictive, due to the short nightly interruptions that would allow their use. This is where most of the films set in the Paris metro are shot. Depending on the needs of the film, fake enamel signs with different station names are created to turn the station into a different one for the duration of the filming.\n\n\n== Projects ==\nIn particular, these two tracks are intended to be used for the possible merger of lines 3 bis and 7 bis, as planned in the Master Plan for the Île-de-France Region (SDRIF- Schéma Directeur de la Région Île-de-France).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nRobert, Jean (1983).

He served his time and was duly admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons' Company on 7 March 1703. He served the office of steward of anatomy in 1704, and on 1 June 1731 he was fined rather than serve as steward of the ladies' feast. He was elected an examiner in the company on 27 August 1734, and on 17 August 1738 he became a member of its court of assistants. He then paid a fine of 30l. to avoid serving the offices of warden and master, to which he would have been elected in due course. He lived for many years in Brooke Street, Holborn, where he enjoyed a lucrative practice. He was called into consultation by John Ranby (1703–1773), when Caroline, the queen of George II, was mortally ill of a strangulated hernia. He sided in this consultation with Ranby against Busier, who was in favour of an immediate operation. Lord Hervey says of him that he was ‘one of the most eminent and able of the whole profession.’ He died on 17 September 1748.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1897). \"Shipton, John\".

        "content": "Ruedi Hagen Keller (born 2 May 1937, in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany) is a German historian specializing in the history of the early and high Middle Ages. He works mainly on the Ottonian period, the Italian communes, and the culture of writing in the Middle Ages. Keller taught as Professor of Medieval History at the University of Münster from 1982 until his retirement in 2002. His collaboration with his colleague Gerd Althoff was particularly fruitful. With their work, Keller and Althoff made a decisive contribution to Münster's reputation in international medieval studies. Keller's research has had a considerable influence on German and international medieval studies since the 1980s and has led to a reassessment of early and high medieval kingship.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Origin and early years ===\nHagen Keller was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, in May 1937, the son of Rudolf Keller, an independent businessman, and his wife Ruth, who was born in Frankenbach. He has four siblings, including volcanologist Jörg Keller. Italy held a special attraction for the whole family. The family first travelled to Italy in 1952 to Lake Maggiore. Starting in the 1950s, the father established business relations with Italy. He imported Italian woodworking machinery. Keller's younger brothers continued the business. Keller's younger sister worked as an au pair, teaching German to the children of an Italian family. Jörg Keller studied for a time in Catania and later worked as a volcanologist in Italy.\nAfter the bombing of Freiburg in 1944, the family lived in Pfullendorf, north of Lake Constance. They returned to Freiburg in 1950. During his school years, Hagen Keller was intensely interested in astronomy. From childhood on, he was less interested in historical novels or biographies; his historical curiosity was stimulated more by monuments and concrete objects. The starting point for his historical awareness was the direct experience of his childhood, the Second World War and National Socialism.\nKeller graduated from the Kepler Gymnasium in Freiburg in 1956. Inspired by his high school math and physics classes, he initially planned to study those subjects. However, he abandoned this plan shortly before the semester began. Keller decided to become a teacher. From the summer semester of 1956 to the summer semester of 1962, he studied history, Latin philology, science policy, German studies, philosophy, and physical education at the universities of Freiburg and Kiel. In his first semester, he completed the Medieval Proseminar with Manfred Hellmann. His interest in the Middle Ages was awakened during his third semester in the summer of 1957 by Hans Blumenberg's Kiel lecture on the philosophy of the 14th and 15th centuries. After his return to Freiburg, Keller concentrated on this period with Gerd Tellenbach.\n\n\n=== Academic career ===\nFrom the beginning of 1959, Keller belonged to the \"Freiburg working group\" for medieval personal research, a group of young researchers led by Gerd Tellenbach. There he met Karl Schmid, Joachim Wollasch, Eduard Hlawitschka, Hansmartin Schwarzmaier and Wilhelm Kurze. The professional exchange with Karl Schmid had a particularly lasting influence on him. As a student of Tellenbach, Keller initially dealt with basic questions of the Alemannic-Franconian history of the early Middle Ages. In 1962, he completed his doctorate under Tellenbach on the subject of Einsiedeln Monastery in Ottonian Swabia.\nIn 1962/63, Keller was a research assistant to Tellenbach at the Institute for Historical Regional Studies at the University of Freiburg, and from 1963 to 1969 he was a research assistant at the German Historical Institute in Rome. It was during his stay in Rome that Keller determined that the social structure of medieval Italy would be one of the focal points of his future work. Keller also spent the first years of his marriage to Hanni Kahlert, whom he married in 1964, in Italy.\nFrom 1969 to 1972, Keller again worked as a research assistant at the History Department of the University of Freiburg. There, in 1972, he earned his habilitation with a dissertation entitled Seniors and Vassals, Capitans and Valvassors. Studies on the ruling class in the Lombard cities of the 9th-12th centuries with special reference to Milan, the teaching qualification for Medieval and Modern History. The habilitation thesis was substantially revised and expanded for printing. In July 1972 he gave his inaugural lecture in Freiburg on Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages in the area between Lake Geneva and the High Rhine.\nAfter another stay at the German Historical Institute in Rome from 1972 to 1973, Keller worked as a university lecturer in Freiburg. In 1976 he was appointed associate professor. In 1978 he received a C3 professorship for Medieval History at the University of Freiburg. In 1979/80 he was Dean of the Philosophical Faculty IV and spokesman of the Joint Committee of the Philosophical Faculties of the University of Freiburg. From 1980 to 1982, Keller was head of the Department of Regional History in the Department of History.\nIn 1982 he succeeded Karl Hauck at the University of Münster, where he was full professor of medieval history and co-director of the Institute for Early Medieval Studies until his retirement in 2002. He gave his inaugural lecture in June 1983 on population growth and social organization in the European High Middle Ages using the example of Upper Italian agrarian society in the 12th and 13th centuries. In Münster, Keller was one of the founders and for many years the spokesman of the special research area \"Carriers, Fields, Forms of Pragmatic Writing\" and of the graduate program \"Written Culture and Society in the Middle Ages. Keller was instrumental in making Münster a centre of international medieval studies.\nAs an academic teacher, he supervised 25 dissertations and five habilitations. His academic students include Franz-Josef Arlinghaus, Marita Blattmann, Christoph Dartmann, Jenny Rahel Oesterle, Hedwig Röckelein, Thomas Scharff, and Petra Schulte. He was succeeded in Münster by Martin Kintzinger. Keller gave his farewell lecture in Münster in July 2002 on the overcoming and presence of the \"Middle Ages\" in European modernity. In it, he tried to define the current position of the Middle Ages. Since the 15th century, there has been a widespread social desire to distance oneself from the Middle Ages. Reform, revolution, rationality, and technical inventions, including their economic and military uses, had formed the guiding principles and the framework of life with which people wanted to distinguish themselves from the Middle Ages. In the last three decades, however, historians have increasingly relativized the epochal boundary around 1500. The scholarly discussion of epochal boundaries and epochal designations illustrates a new way of thinking about the relationship between the present and our long past. In the face of an increasingly unclear awareness of the epoch, Keller locates the task and topicality of medieval studies in the self-assurance of man, for which knowledge of the past is necessary.\nKeller was co-editor of Propylaea History of Germany from 1982 to 1995 and co-editor of the series Münster Historical Research since 1991. From 1988 to 2011 he was editor of Early Medieval Studies. He has been a member of the Commission for Historical Regional Studies in Baden-Württemberg since 1980, of the Konstanz Working Group for Medieval History since 1989, and of the Historical Commission for Westphalia since 1990. Keller has been a visiting professor at the Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Storici in Naples (1979), at the University of Florence (1997), and at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris (2001). In 2002 he was elected to the British Academy and in the same year he became a member of the Royal Historical Society in London.\nThe 36th volume of Early Medieval Studies was dedicated to him. On the occasion of his 70th birthday in 2007, a conference was held in his honour in Münster, the results of which were published in 2011 in the anthology Between Pragmatics and Performance. Dimensions of Medieval Written Culture. In May 2017, on the occasion of his 80th birthday, a colloquium was held at the Department of History of the University of Münster. The focus was on current perspectives on the history of politics in the Middle Ages.\n\n\n== Work ==\nKeller produced more than 150 publications. His works on the foundations and manifestations of Ottonian kingship, on the nobility and urban society in Italy, on the upheavals of the Salian and Staufer periods, and the early period of the Duchy of Swabia are important. From 1975 he worked closely with Gerd Althoff, a student of Keller's mentor Karl Schmid. Their exchange was particularly fruitful for the study of Ottonian historiography and the complex problems of group behaviour and statehood.\n\n\n=== The foundations of Ottonian kingship ===\n\nThe starting point for Keller's work on the functioning of Ottonian kingship was the research of his teacher Gerd Tellenbach. In the 1950s, the \"Freiburg Working Group\" recognized that entries in the fraternity and commemorative books of the early Middle Ages were made in groups. In times of crisis, members of the ruling classes increasingly had the names of their relatives and friends entered into the monastery registers. This had remained hidden from earlier research, which had focused on constitutional history. The analysis of the commemorative tradition brought a completely new understanding of the ties and contacts that the nobility, the church, and the kings maintained with each other. It also made the accounts in Ottonian historiography easier to understand. The \"Freiburg Working Group\" produced numerous prosopographic, aristocratic, and social-historical works, especially in the 10th century. According to Gerd Althoff, the scholarly discussion on the \"emergence\" of the \"German\" empire was also important for Keller's research. As a result, Keller formulated his new view of the \"foundations of Ottonian kingship\" on the occasion of Gerd Tellenbach's 80th birthday in 1983. His remarks showed that he viewed this kingship differently from his teacher Tellenbach and some of Tellenbach's older students, such as Josef Fleckenstein. According to Fleckenstein, all the king's activities were aimed at strengthening his power over the nobility and the church in the long run. Keller, on the other hand, based his analysis of the political order of the Ottonian Empire on a polycentric system of rule. In his view, a count of royal courts, royal estates, taxes, customs duties, and other revenues did not adequately describe the state order and the possibilities of political organization in the 10th and 11th centuries. For Keller, it was no longer the acquisition and expansion of power that was the yardstick for measuring the achievements of Ottonian rulers, but rather their integrative function. The kingship had the task of integrating the individual aristocratic dominions \"by shaping personal relationships and thus giving them the quality of a ruling and legal order. In light of these findings, the image of a personal associational state based on loyalty and allegiance to a leader, as portrayed by Otto Brunner and Theodor Mayer under the influence of National Socialism, was considered outdated. As a result, Gerd Althoff examined the personal networks of relationships that kings and magnates established, maintained, and, when necessary, were able to change.\nKeller's 1982 essay Imperial Structure and Concept of Rule in the Ottonian-Early Salian Period, which Gerd Althoff described as the \"initial spark\" for further research into the foundations of Ottonian kingship, is considered a methodologically important study for understanding Ottonian kingship. In this work, Keller examined the relationship between the Ottonian-Salian rulers and the southern German dukes in Bavaria and Swabia on the basis of the places where the documents of Otto I, Henry II, and Henry III were issued. This is the first time that the importance of Swabia in the Ottonian and early Salian itinerary has been examined. Keller observed a profound change in Ottonian kingship. Until the time of Otto III, Swabia had been used only as a transit country to Italy; royal stays were kept as short as possible. From the year 1000, however, royal rule was publicly demonstrated by the \"periodic presence of the court in all parts of the empire. This essay paved the way for a new understanding of the expansion of Ottonian kingship in the Empire.\nIn their double biography of the first two Ottonians, Henry I, and Otto I, published in 1985, Hagen Keller and Gerd Althoff made intensive use of the findings on medieval prayer commemoration. In particular, the commemoration of prayers in the Ottonian house monasteries of Lüneburg and Merseburg gave an impression of the kinship and alliance relationships of the noble owners. Amicitiae (alliances of friendship) became the central instrument of Henry I rule in his dealings with the magnate, while convivia (communal ritual feasts) was the starting point for political alliances and conspiracies. For Althoff and Keller, the first two Ottonian rulers were no longer symbols of Germany's early power and greatness, but rather representatives of an archaic society far removed from modern thinking. Keller and Althoff identified a structural change in the reigns of Henry I and Otto I. As king, Henry had achieved a balance with numerous rulers through formal alliances of friendship. For Keller and Althoff, the arrangement with the dukes based on these friendship treaties was one of the \"foundations for the rapid success in stabilizing royal rule. Henry's son Otto I, on the other hand, had not continued these mutually binding alliances (pacta mutua) with the magnate of his realm, thereby provoking conflict. Otto had shown no consideration for the claims of his kinsmen and nobility; rather, he was concerned with asserting his royal authority. By adopting Carolingian traditions, Otto emphasized the distance between the king and the nobility. Given Henry's friendly alliances with the southern German dukes, Althoff and Keller argue that, according to the understanding of the time, \"the dukes' claims were hardly less well-founded or justified than his claim to kingship. Accordingly, it was only logical that Henry renounced an additional legitimation of his kingship by renouncing the anointing when he became king. The realization of the meaning and significance of the amicitia alliances also relativized the image of an anticlerical king painted by older scholars. Henry entered into prayer alliances with both ecclesiastical and secular magnates. According to Althoff and Keller, the friendship pacts with the dukes also created a new scope for the king. The magnates themselves had ties and obligations that extended beyond the borders of the realm. The arrangement with the dukes and the resulting increase in power and prestige gave the king new opportunities to work to his advantage in neighbouring areas of the empire.\nAt the 1988 German Historians Conference in Bamberg, Keller chaired the section on \"Group ties, organization of rule, and written culture under the Ottonians. There he addressed the fundamental problem of \"statehood\" in the early Middle Ages, presenting a paper entitled \"On the character of 'statehood' between Carolingian imperial reform and the expansion of rule in the High Middle Ages\". According to Keller, the political culture of the Ottonians in the 10th century cannot be captured by the categories of modern statehood. Ottonian rule was largely without written form, without institutions, without regulated responsibilities and lines of authority, and above all without a monopoly on the use of force. The political order of the Ottonian period was characterized by orality, rituals, and personal ties, whereas the Carolingian empire was characterized by writing, institutions, a highly centralized form of rule, and the royal distribution of offices. The possibilities and limits of royal rule in the tenth century under these conditions were examined in Bamberg by Gerd Althoff about the institutional mechanisms of conflict resolution between king and magnate, and by Rudolf Schieffer about the relationship between the episcopate and the king. The Bamberg lectures were published in Early Medieval Studies in 1989 and are considered an important starting point for a reassessment of Ottonian kingship.\nThe knowledge of the commemorative tradition also created new conditions for reading the works of Ottonian historiography. In the course of cataloguing the monastic commemorative books of the Carolingian and Ottonian periods, Karl Schmid came across an entry in the Reichenau commemorative book that referred to Otto as rex as early as 929. His research in 1960 and 1964 on the succession to the throne of Otto I brought new facts into the scholarly discussion. Until then, research had been based solely on the information provided by Widukind of Corvey, whose Saxon History seemed to indicate that King Henry I had appointed his eldest son Otto as his successor in 936, shortly before his death. In an essay on Widukind's account of Otto the Great's accession to the throne in Aachen, written in 1995 in the context of the discussion on the critique of memory and tradition, Keller emphasized the importance of the results that Karl Schmid had obtained based on the memory tradition: they \"enable and force a different kind of access: namely, to examine the intention of representation and its 'deforming' effect on the 'report' at a central point by confronting it with deviating information. At the same time, Johannes Fried pointed out that historical events are subject to a powerful process of deformation. Historical memory \"changes incessantly and imperceptibly, even during the lifetimes of those involved. According to Fried, the resulting view of the past was \"never identical with actual history. For Fried, the Widukind of Corvey History of the Saxons, the main source for the early Othonian kingship, is \"a construct saturated with errors. Based on Schmid's work on a possible succession to Henry I as early as 928/29, Keller again turned to Widukind's criticism. In contrast to the approach to the unreliability of Ottonian historiography developed by the historians Fedor Schneider, Martin Lintzel, and Carlrichard Brühl and continued by Johannes Fried, Keller concentrated on the effects of a deliberately shaped and deformed representation that aims to show something specific about events. Keller fundamentally doubted whether it was legitimate to apply ethnological methods to a literate medieval historian like Widukind to study completely unwritten cultures. Rather, Widukind's point of view was \"based on the entire arsenal of literary design possibilities of a writing culture rich in tradition. Against Fried's criticism of tradition, Keller argued that in 967/68 there were still contemporary witnesses who had directly experienced the events of the royal revolts and successions of 919, 929/30, and 936. Their memories could not be ignored. It is known from Italian interrogations of witnesses in the 12th and 13th centuries that the memories of the oldest witnesses went back up to 70 years, according to their own statements. According to Keller, a royal elevation with simultaneous anointing took place for the first time in the Ottonian period in 961, not in 936. Keller understood Widukind's account of the election and coronation of Otto I in Aachen in 936 as a backward projection by the historian based on the model of the coronation and anointing of Otto II in Aachen in 961, at which he was present as a witness. Keller had already put forward this thesis in lectures in 1969 and 1972. Otto's spiritual consecration had already taken place in Mainz in 930. Keller refers to a note in the 13th-century Lausanne Annals, which is given new significance by Schmid's work on Henry's succession to the throne. The Aachen Act of 936 thus only appears to be a demonstration of power. According to Keller, this reconstruction also clarifies the previously \"rather confusing history of coronation law and the coronation site in the Roman-German Empire\". However, it does not expose Widukind as a fabulist. Rather, Keller evaluates Widukind's depiction of \"self-experienced\" history as a statement on current issues. Widukind's description of the coronation should be understood as a critique of the growing influence of the church on the legitimation of rule and the increasing sacralization of kingship. The historian contrasts this development with the \"divine plan of salvation,\" i.e., the rise of the Saxons to kingship as an expression of divine activity and warrior kingship. Keller comes to completely different conclusions than Hartmut Hoffmann, who rejects Schmid's thesis of a decision on the succession in 929/30 and an early anointing of Otto.\nIn another study, Keller attempts to show that Widukind's historical view of the Ottonian kingship was shaped by biblical ideas. The exhortations that Judas Maccabeus or his brothers are said to have given to their troops before the start of a battle are comparable to the speeches of the Saxon kings Heinrich and Otto before the Hungarian battles of 933 and 955. The Maccabean leaders would have exhorted their followers to put all their trust in God and the victories God had granted their forefathers, and to stand with their lives for the validity of the divine law. The enemies, on the other hand, could only trust in their superior strength and their weapons. Widukind was convinced that the military successes of King Henry and his son Otto repeated the victories God had granted the Maccabees against the superiority of their godless enemies.\nIn examining the portrayal of rulers in Ottonian historiography of the 960s (Widukind, Liudprand of Cremona, and Hrotsvit), Keller rejects \"interpreting the authors' statements simply as testimony to a free-floating history of ideas about kingship. Rather, Keller argues, the statements of Ottonian historiography are \"directly related to life\" and their formulations are to be understood as \"statements on questions that moved the innermost circle of the court, the rulers of the time.\n\nBy examining various source genres (historiography, symbols of rule, images of rulers), Keller was able to identify a fundamental link between Ottonian kingship and the Christian ethics of rulers. In his studies of the change in the image of the ruler on Carolingian and Ottonian royal and imperial seals, he no longer understood them as mere propaganda of power but took greater account of the liturgical context of the tradition. He observed a fundamental change in the representation of power under Otto the Great. After the imperial coronation in 962, the depiction of the ruler on the seals changed from Frankish-Carolingian models to a Byzantine model: the half-figure of the king in side view became the emperor in frontal view. Keller studied the portrait of the sovereign in the codex Ottobonianus latinus 74 of the Vatican Library, which is kept in Montecassino. He dates the manuscript to the time of Henry III (\"around 1045/47\"). The image of the sovereign on folio 193v is not Henry II, but Henry III. He bases his thesis on Wipo's Tetralogus and points to similarities in the understanding of rulership between the miniature and the literary work. Until Keller's interpretation, the portrait had always referred to Henry II.\nSymbolic communication also became important for a reassessment of early and high medieval kingship. Hagen Keller, in close collaboration with Gerd Althoff, has thought about demonstrative-ritual and symbolic behaviour in the Ottonian period. The study of rituals and forms of symbolic communication led to the realization that Ottonian historians' representational intentions were primarily focused on the ruler's ties and obligations to God and his loyal followers. Given the importance of personal ties and symbolic forms of communication, Gerd Althoff developed the trenchant thesis of the Ottonian \"kingship without state.\n\nIn addition to the lack of institutional penetration of the Ottonian kingdom, the exercise of consensual rule is a central criterion in Keller's analysis of the foundations of Ottonian kingship. According to Keller, the king derived his dignity and authority from the consensus of his loyal followers and from the divinely legitimized order of which he was the administrator. In a study of the king's role in the appointment of bishops in the Ottonian and Salian kingdoms, Keller showed that promotions were usually the consensual result of negotiations between the ruler and the cathedral chapter.\nIn 2001, Keller published a concise presentation of Ottonian history for a wider audience. This overview appeared in its fourth edition in 2008 and was translated into Czech in 2004 and into Italian in 2012. In 2002, on the occasion of Keller's 65th birthday, seven essays written between 1982 and 1997 were published in the anthology Ottonian Kingship. Organization and Legitimation of Royal Power. Together with Gerd Althoff, Keller wrote volume 3 of the new \"Gebhardt\" (Handbook of German History) on the late Carolingian and Ottonian period, which was published in 2008. Keller wrote the section on the period from the end of the Carolingian Empire to the end of the reign of Otto II. The chapter on \"Lebensordnungen und Lebensformen\" was written jointly by the two authors. Their declared aim was a \"fundamental revision of the traditional view of history\", i.e. the \"denationalization of the image of the Ottonian Empire\".\n\n\n=== Italian urban communities and written culture in the Middle Ages ===\nSince about 1965, the relationships between individuals and families in the Middle Ages have been studied with the help of private documents. This new approach was implemented by Gerd Tellenbach and his students using examples from Tuscany and Lombardy. Of particular importance for the history of the city was the in-depth study of the ruling structures based on private documents. In 1969, Keller published his first study on Italy. In it, he examined the place of jurisdiction within the larger cities of Tuscany and northern Italy from the 9th to the 11th centuries and concluded the balance of power between king, bishop, count, and urban patrician. The study shows how the rising powers in the cities, the capitani (high nobility) and the vavasour, slipped away from the influence of the sovereign. Keller also notes the collapse of the material foundations of Lombard Italian kingship: imperial property and imperial rights were lost to the feudal nobility. In his habilitation thesis published in 1979, Aristocratic Rule and Urban Society in Northern Italy, he no longer focuses solely on the high aristocracy of counts and margraves, but also on the middle nobility, the capitani and valvassors known as episcopal (sub-)vassals. Keller first analyzes the development of the terms plebs, populus, civis, capitaneus, and vavasour in the 11th and 12th centuries. He then examines the wealth situation of capitani, peasants, and vavasour. He sees the cause of the Upper Italian vassal uprisings at the end of the 10th and beginning of the 11th century in the \"revindication of church property and imperial rights that had been left to the churches\". It was therefore a matter of resisting measures that threatened the position of the nobility. In terms of social development, Keller notes \"a constancy of the aristocratic upper class from the late 9th to the 12th century and a social dynamic below this aristocratic leadership group that was shaped by changes in ruling structures and reinforced by economic development. Because the study analyzed mainly Milanese sources, it was perceived in Italy primarily as a study of Milan and its sphere of influence. Keller, however, wanted to use a regional example to show \"how far and in what ways the social history of northern Italy was involved in the general developments of the société féodale during the 10th-12th centuries\". Keller's work, which was translated into Italian in 1995, is considered one of the most important case studies of Italian communes.\nIn 1986, the new medieval special research field 231 was established at the University of Münster on the subject of \"Carriers, Fields and Forms of Pragmatic Writing in the Middle Ages\". The international debate on the conditions of communication in oral societies in the 1960s and 1970s provided the impetus for an interdisciplinary research project on the development of European written culture in the Middle Ages. The work of the Collaborative Research Center built on this research situation. Numerous studies on the pragmatics of writing itself or on the function of administrative writing in northern Italian communities were initiated and directed by Keller. The Collaborative Research Center dealt with the development of writing in Europe from the 11th to the early 16th century. According to the initial 1985 proposal, this was the period in which writing \"assumed a life-giving function for society and the individual. The 11th and 12th centuries are considered a crucial transitional period for northern Italy. During this period, writing spread to all areas of human interaction. The research program of the Collaborative Research Center was carried out in seven subprojects starting in 1986. The results, presented and discussed at four international colloquia, have been published in four comprehensive volumes. Pragmatic writing is understood as action-oriented writing. In the sense of the research program, \"pragmatic\" means all \"forms of writing that directly serve purposeful action or that aim to guide human action and behavior by imparting knowledge,\" i.e., \"written material for whose creation and use the requirements of life practice were constitutive. Keller studied pragmatic writing primarily about Italian urban communities and the communal societies of the High Middle Ages.\nFrom 1986 to 1999, Keller directed subproject A, \"The Writing Process and its Carriers in Upper Italy,\" as part of the Collaborative Research Center 231. From the 12th century onwards, the source base in communal Italy expanded. Written documentation for government and administration increased to an extent that has no parallel in Europe, despite the general increase in writing. According to Keller, three factors favored the process of writing in the administration of Italian communes. The first was the temporal limitation of the exercise of municipal authority; this required the written record of administrative actions and procedural steps in the administration of justice to ensure continuity. Second, the fear of abuse of office led to a detailed definition of official powers and rules of conduct for officials to control the correctness of official conduct and administrative actions. Sanctions had to be established for violations of the rules. The third factor was the increasing measures taken by the municipality to provide for the livelihood, security, and prosperity of the community. The expansion of the use of writing in communal Italy gave rise to a new source genre in the form of statute codices, the comprehensive collections of applicable statute law whose origins, early history, structure, and social significance Keller explored in his research project. The establishment of norms through statutes is seen as an expression of a profound cultural change in Italian municipalities. The sharp increase in the use of written law was therefore accompanied by a large number of new legal provisions, a systematic organization of the statute books and periodic revisions. Within a few decades, the forms of legal protection and legal procedure were fundamentally changed.\nThe research project on the pragmatic use of writing in communal Italy initially focused on the modernization of government and administration. However, further research also revealed the disadvantages of the use of writing. Writing had brought with it an increased regimentation of rural economic management and village life. For example, rural communities were told how much grain they had to deliver to the city, broken down by variety. In the increasing number of leases, the duties of each crop were specified in detail. The peasants' livestock was reduced. The town councils forbade the mountain population to keep pack animals. Only millers and carters were allowed to keep a certain number of these animals, and they had to carry registration papers for police control.\nKeller and his research group in Münster were able to show numerous examples of how administrative and governmental actions in Italian municipalities were continuously and completely written down. This was accompanied by a new way of dealing with records. Thanks to systematic archiving, files could be found and used again generations later. Written documentation helped, for example, to ensure that the local population was provided for in times of need, and it also made it easier to track down heretics. According to Thomas Scharff, a colleague of Keller's, the medieval inquisition was \"inconceivable without the growth of pragmatic writing.\nOn the basis of his research on the administrative records of the Italian communes, which grew enormously from the end of the 12th century, Keller examined the social side effects and anthropological consequences of this process of writing. He asked about the significance of writing for people's worldviews and strategies of action. His thesis is \"that the forms of cognitive orientation associated with writing are of direct importance for the process of individualization that can be traced in European society since the High Middle Ages\". These considerations are related to the general discussion of the emergence of individuality from the 12th century onwards. Keller used tax collection and grain and supply policies to show that the living conditions of each individual citizen in the community were integrated into controllable procedures through administrative writing. The process of writing around 1200 also led to a profound change in the legal life of Italian cities. Writing down the law meant that individuals could free themselves from group ties and locate themselves in the political and social order.\n\n\n=== Symbolic communication ===\n\nThe subproject directed by Keller, Document and Book in the Symbolic Communication of Medieval Legal Communities and Ruling Associations (2000–2008), was part of the Collaborative Research Center 496: Symbolic Communication and Social Value Systems from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution. One of the key questions of the Collaborative Research Center was: \"When and why did people change acts of symbolic communication, introduce new ones, or abandon old ones?\" This subproject also focused on communal Italy. The project dealt with the possible interpretations of the use of writing in its communicative context. The aim was to gain new insights into the creation and use of sovereign documents in the early and high Middle Ages.\nThe inclusion of symbolic communication contributed to a reevaluation of written form. According to Keller, deeds were \"the most important and at the same time the most solemn medium of written communication\" in early medieval governing and legal communities. In the case of rulers' charters, Keller argued that more attention should be paid to the hitherto under-studied act of privilege and the circumstances that led to the creation of the charters. A comprehensive and adequate assessment of the historical significance of a document is only possible by taking symbolic communication into account. Keller argues that the text of a document and its symbolic public interaction are inextricably intertwined. Only when the overall structure and message of a charter and its historical situation are taken into account are the prerequisites for a better understanding of privilege and the act of privileging given. Keller thus sees charters not only as textual or legal documents but also as a means of representation and self-representation of the ruler and as a \"sign of sovereignty\" in the king's communication with his followers. According to Keller, the act of granting the charter was less an expression of the ruler's free will than the result of a process of communication and consensus-building between the ruler and various interest groups. Privileging should be understood as a ritualized communication process that went far beyond the mere act of issuing the charter. The immediate context of the creation and use of a deed can be better understood by classifying it as a ceremonial act. Parts of the charter should be interpreted as deliberate communicative signals. In this way, a charter, which puts a legal fact into writing, becomes a source for a specific situation in the medieval ruling community. According to Keller's research, the \"written cultural elements of authenticity assurance\" in early and high Carolingian charters were replaced around 860 by greater publicity and representativeness in the act of authentication. The king's monogram and seal were enlarged and clearly separated from the text. The \"visual presentation of the document\" seems to be \"embedded in a change in the ruler's public communication with his followers. This type of sealing took into account the poor literacy of the secular officials. The document thus became a medium of symbolic communication in the 10th century. According to Keller, the meaning of the deed and the document changed during the 11th and 12th centuries as perceptions of the social foundations of law and the guarantee of law by rule and community changed. From the middle of the 12th century, the use of writing and the differentiation of business documents in the socio-cultural context can be observed.\n\n\n=== Upheavals in the Salian and Staufer periods ===\nIn an essay published in 1983 on the behaviour of the Swabian dukes of the 11th and 12th centuries as pretenders to the throne, Keller initiated a paradigm shift in German-language medieval studies with the idea of \"princely responsibility for the empire\". His new research approach was based on the motives of the magnates and the fundamental relationship between king, princes, and empire as a whole. Keller identified a change in the understanding of elections in the 11th and 12th centuries and was able to show that the behaviour of the Swabian dukes had motives other than the previously assumed motive of \"princely self-interest. From 1002, and increasingly from 1077, the princes claimed to be able to \"act as a group for the realm [...] and to assert themselves as the general public against special interests\". As a result, the empire became \"an association capable of acting even without the king. With this view, Keller opposed the older scholarly opinion that the princes were the \"gravediggers of the realm\" whose behaviour in the Middle Ages had contributed to the decline of royal central authority.\nKeller's account of the High Middle Ages in the second volume of the Propylaea History of Germany (1986) was highly acclaimed in medieval research. The book is divided into three main parts: The Salian Empire in the Upheaval of the Early Medieval World (1024-1152) (pp. 57–216), The Reorganization of Living Conditions in the Development of Human Thought and Action (pp. 219–371) and The German Empire between World Empire, Papal Authority and Princely Power (1152-1250) (pp. 375–500). In his account, Keller no longer interpreted the conflicts in the Salian and Hohenstaufen period as disputes between royalty and nobility but described the \"royal rule in and above the rank dispute between the magnates\". Fighting rebellions was an essential part of Salian governance. According to Keller, conflicts arose whenever there was a threat of changes in the hierarchy and power structure. When offices or fiefs had to be redistributed after the death of their holders, disputes arose. But it was also a central task of the king to settle local conflicts. In contrast to historians such as Egon Boshof or Stefan Weinfurter, Keller did not regard the increasing criticism of Henry III's reign in the last decade of his reign as a sign of a fundamental crisis, since otherwise, the entire Ottonian and Salian period would have to be described as an epoch of crisis.\nIn a lecture given in September 2000 and published in 2006, Keller notes a change in social values in the 12th century. He observes a clearer emergence of the individual personality in society. At the same time, there was a change in the political order, which integrated the personal existence of people more strongly than before into universally valid norms. According to Keller, these two developments belong together as complementary phenomena. He cites numerous political and social changes to support his thesis of an interweaving of communal order and individual responsibility. Since the twelfth century, the oath had not only taken on greater significance, but by swearing it, the individual now bound himself to the whole of the political community. From the twelfth century onwards, an innovation in the oath was a self-binding commitment to the principles of community life. In addition, not only the legal system changed in the 12th century, but above all the concept of law. In criminal law, the understanding of punishment and guilt had changed: Acts committed under personal responsibility were no longer to be compensated with a compositio, but rather punished with a just penalty graded according to the severity of the offence. Keller devoted further publications to the changes and upheavals of the 12th century.\n\n\n== Scientific repercussions ==\nKeller's analysis of Ottonian kingship, his constitutional and regional historical observations on how kingship penetrated a territory, his research on rituals and conflicts, and his comments on charters and seals as vehicles of communication between rulers and recipients of charters have played a significant role in the reassessment of high medieval kingship that began in the 1980s. Hans-Werner Goetz (2003), for example, sees early medieval kingship as primarily characterized by ritual and the representation of power.\nKeller's 1982 findings on the exercise of royal rule, which encompassed all parts of the empire around 1000, have been widely accepted by scholars. In 2012, however, Steffen Patzold, in contrast to Keller's view of the integration of the southern German duchies, considered Swabia to be a peripheral zone of the empire even under Henry II, since not a single synod that met in the presence of Henry II took place in Swabia. The celebration of a high feast (Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost), which was regarded as an act of royal representation and exercise of power, took place only once in Swabia. Patzold also referred to the documentary material: only five percent of all the charters of Henry II were issued in Swabia.\nThe interpretation of charters as visual media advocated by Keller and his research group has become generally accepted in historical scholarship. More recent works hardly perceive charters as mere texts. The work that emerged from the project \"The writing process and its carriers in northern Italy\" between 1986 and 1999 has so far only been selectively received in Italian medieval research - probably mainly for linguistic reasons.\nIn 2001, August Nitschke argued against overemphasizing the contrast between \"Carolingian statehood\" and Ottonian \"royal rule without a state\". He concludes: \"The transition from Carolingian statehood to the personal rule of the Ottonians, to a 'personal association state', does not need to be explained; for this 'statehood' did not exist under the Carolingians. In other studies, such as those by Roman Deutinger and Steffen Patzold, the contrast between the forms of rule in the Carolingian and Ottonian periods emphasized by Keller is seen as far less profound.\nKeller's and Althoff's research on amicitia alliances and oaths, polycentric rule, written culture, rituals, and symbols has added considerably to our knowledge. Their views have been widely accepted in contemporary medieval studies of the Ottonians. Her dual biography of Henry I and Otto the Great, published in 1985, was supplemented in 2008 by Wolfgang Giese's biography to reflect the current state of research. In a work published in 2001, Jutta Schlick examined the royal elections and court days from 1056 to 1159, primarily on the basis of Keller's research. In her post-doctoral thesis, published in Passau in 2003, Elke Goez dealt with pragmatic writing by examining \"the administrative and archival practice of the Cistercians, their handling of their own documentary and administrative records\".\nMost of Keller's students were also members of the Münster Collaborative Research Center; their positions were funded by the German Research Foundation as part of the Collaborative Research Center. The investigations therefore remained strongly focused on the topic of the research project headed by Keller, \"The writing process and its carriers in Upper Italy\". This allowed a \"school\" to develop in Münster in the sense of a circle of students with a common field of research: Roland Rölker examined the role of different families in the Contado (the area claimed as a dominion and economic area) and in the municipality of Modena, Nikolai Wandruszka analyzed the social development of Bologna in the High Middle Ages, Thomas Behrmann traced the writing process from the 11th to the 13th century on the basis of the two document collections in Novara, the cathedral chapter of S. Maria and the chapter of the Basilica of S. Gaudenzio, which was separated from it.\nJörg W. Busch worked on the historiography of Milan from the late 11th to the early 14th century, Petra Koch on the Vercellese municipal statutes of 1241 and 1341, and Peter Lütke Westhues on the Veronese municipal statutes of 1228 and 1276. Patrizia Carmassi analyzed the use and application of liturgical books in the ecclesiastical institutions of the city of Milan from the Carolingian period to the 14th century, Thomas Scharff traced the use of writing in the context of the Inquisition in several contributions, Christoph Dartmann researched the beginnings of the Milanese commune (1050–1140), the consular commune of Genoa in the 12th century and the municipal commune of Florence around 1300, and Petra Schulte dealt with the trust in Upper Italian notarial deeds of the 12th and 13th centuries. Petra Schulte dealt with the trust in the Upper Italian notarial deeds of the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nA list of his writings appeared in: Thomas Scharff, Thomas Behrmann (eds.): Bene vivere in communitate.

His music first gained popularity in Tallahassee before spreading to other parts of Florida.BossMan Dlow released his debut mixtape Too Slippery in January 2023, which gained traction on TikTok. He signed a record deal with Alamo Records in the summer of 2023, who re-released Too Slippery as 2 Slippery in December 2023. His single \"Get in with Me\", originally performed as a freestyle on the Jacksonville–based series Kreepin Through the Streetz, was released through Alamo Records in January 2024. It soon became popular on Instagram and TikTok—particularly due to a feud between Rick Ross's ex-partner, Tia Kemp, and his daughter, Toie Roberts, during which Kemp posted a video using the song—and subsequently debuted on Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts the following month. It peaked at number 49 on the Hot 100 after spending five weeks on the chart. His single \"Mr Pot Scraper\" was released in February of that year and also became popular. BossMan Dlow's third mixtape, Mr Beat the Road, was released on March 15, 2024, with \"Get in with Me\", \"Mr Pot Scraper\", and \"Piss Me Off\" as its singles. A remix of his song \"Finesse\", from his mixtape 2 Slippery, with rapper GloRilla was released later that month.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBossMan Dlow has listed Wiz Khalifa, Babyface Ray, Yo Gotti, Jeezy, Lil Wayne, Plies, and Future as his musical influences. He has described his songs as \"motivation music\". Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork wrote that his \"dope-dealing motivation rap\" was backed by \"Michigan-meets-the-South party beats\". For Uproxx, Aaron Williams wrote that BossMan Dlow had a \"choppy, unconventional delivery and [a] Florida twang\" in his raps. Joey Ech of XXL wrote that BossMan Dlow had \"impeccable swagger, [a] conversational cadence and [a] booming baritone voice\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alice Cary McKinney (née Sadler; 1865–1928) was an American temperance and social reformer. She served as President of the Louisiana Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAlice Cary Sadler was born in Alabama at Fort Deposit or Pollard, March 20, 1865. Her parents were Francis Wilson Sadler, Jr (b. 1827) and Loretta Cary Crary Sadler (1831-1910). Alice's siblings were: Everett, Olive, John, Ella, Harriet, and Ida.\nShe was educated in the public schools of Alabama and at Whitworth Female College, Brookhaven, Mississippi. \n\n\n== Career ==\nShe left college during her junior year (1884) to teach school in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, where she remained until 1886. \nEarly in life, McKinney had become interested in the temperance movement, and after becoming affiliated with the WCTU, served in almost every capacity in the local county and State bodies, including the editorship of the State WCTU organ, White Ribbon, and the preparation of temperance columns for other publications.\nRemoving to Ruston, Louisiana, McKinney affiliated with the Louisiana WCTU in which organization she has held successively the offices of district secretary (1903–04), recording secretary (1904–05), corresponding secretary (1906–08), and president (1909, till her death in 1928).\nMcKinney was also quite active in the promotion of other social and religious uplift movements. For a time, she was parish superintendent (St. Tammany's Parish) of the Temperance Department of the International Sunday School Association. She was a firm advocate of woman suffrage, and made many speeches favoring both that doctrine and Prohibition. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1887, at Pearl River, Louisiana, she married J. C. H. McKinney (John Columbus Haley McKinney; 1858-1957), of Anguilla, Mississippi. The couple had six children: Conrad, Ethel, Leonox, Gordon, D.L., and Griffin.\nThe young couple lived near Anguilla, Mississippi for a number of years following their marriage, later moving to Louisiana. The couple settled in Ruston around 1903 where Mr. McKinney engaged in the dairy industry.\nMcKinney was a member of the Ruston Methodist Church.\nShe died in a local sanitarium in Shreveport, Louisiana, October 8, 1928, where she had been for ten days undergoing her second blood transfusion in little more than a month.\n\n\n== References ==",

Richard Steevens received his education at the Latin school in Athlone and subsequently at Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained a scholarship in 1674, graduated B.A. in 1675, and M.A. in 1678. Being intended by his father for the church, he took deacon's orders, but proceeded no further in the ministry, and devoted himself to the medical profession. In 1687 he received the degree of M.D. from his university, and thenceforward practised as a physician in Dublin, where he amassed a large fortune. He was a fellow of the Irish College of Physicians, and in 1710 was elected president of that body. He died before the close of his year of office, on 15 December 1710.\nBy his will Steevens bequeathed the bulk of his property to his sister Grizell for her life, and directed that upon her death it should vest in trustees to be applied in building, and subsequently in maintaining, a hospital in Dublin, ‘for maintaining and curing from time to time such sick and wounded persons whose distempers and wounds are curable.’ Grizell Steevens, being ‘desirous that the said charitable bequest of her dear brother should begin to take effect in her lifetime,’ surrendered her estate to the trustees in 1717, reserving only 100 l. a year, out of a rental of 600 l, together with apartments in the hospital when built. She also gave 2,000 l. towards the cost of building. The hospital, thus founded, and since known as Steevens's hospital, was completed in 1733 at a cost of 16,000l., and was the first public hospital established in Dublin, where it became one of the foremost institutions of its kind. Dean Swift was one of its earliest governors, and ‘Stella’ (Esther Johnson) in her will bequeathed 1,000l. towards the maintenance of a chaplain of the hospital, so long as the church of Ireland should remain established. Another benefactor was John Sterne, bishop of Clogher. Grizell Steevens survived till 18 March 1746. By her will she bequeathed the residue of her property to the governors of the hospital. Her remains are interred in the hospital chapel. Portraits of Steevens and his sister were placed in the board-room of the institution.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Falkiner, Cæsar Litton (1898). \"Steevens, Richard\".
