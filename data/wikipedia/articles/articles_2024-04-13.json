        "content": "St John the Baptist's Church is an Anglican church in Acklam, a village near Malton, North Yorkshire, in England.\nAcklam had a church in the Mediaeval period.  It was rebuilt in 1790, as a small building with a nave, chancel, south porch, and square west tower.  It had a capacity of 250 worshippers.  It was again rebuilt in 1868, by J. B. and W. Atkinson of York.  The church was declared redundant and demolished in 1972, following which its site was used to enlarge the burial ground.A Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was erected in Acklam in 1794.  It is a rectangular stone building, with a pantile roof.  It has Gothick pointed windows, with glazing bars.  Following the closure of the church, it was acquired by the Anglican church, and was rededicated as a new St John the Baptist's Church.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Lair of the Lummox\" is the season finale from the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 30 July 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a sequel to the 1991 story Untamed World, Ren and Stimpy are once again hosts of the nature show Untamed World. The duo go looking for the Lummox in the land of Ignoramia. The duo find a Red-Freckled Lummox, which is merely an obese, slovenly American teenager with red freckles who loves to eat junk food. The duo befriend the Lummox by giving him food. The duo watch the \"mating ritual\" of the Lummox as the Killer Kowalski character first introduced in Fake Dad whom Ren and Stimpy call the Tree Lummox competes with the Red-Freckled Lummox to win the love of a female Lummox, who is merely an obese woman.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nKiller Kowalski-voice of Harris Peet\nRed-Freckled Lummox-voice of Bob Camp\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was written in 1992 for the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show at the Spumco studio. The episode was approved, but much of the more vulgar humor was censored by the Nickeloden network. Furthermore, the showrunner, John Kricfalusi wanted to expand Lair of Lummox for half an hour, which further delayed the episode. When the Spümcø studio lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, the episode was taken over by the Games Animation studio, which held it for the third season due to production delays.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski gave Lair of the Lummox three stars out of five, writing it was an amusing end to the third season.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

In 2013, the park attracted attention when several large, illegal cannabis plantations were found in the middle of the park; police had to winch their way in with helicopters to confiscate some of the plants.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nA wide variety of vertebrates have been reported from the park, including, according to the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service, 14 species of amphibian, 19 mammals, 23 reptiles, and nearly 60 different species of bird. Several endangered species, both animal and plant, are found in the park, notably including rare orchids such as leek orchids. The endangered giant burrowing frog is also found there. Bat populations in the park are such that one study captured 38 individuals in five different species in just one night.\nThe park is at moderate risk of dangerous bushfires; it was severely affected by the 2001 bushfire season. Nearly all of the park was impacted by the 2019-20 bushfire season,: 42  which was unprecedentedly large and catastrophic.: 2 \n\n\n== Cannabis incident ==\nIn January 2013, police officers found and seized a total of $279,000 AUD worth of cannabis plants, being grown deep in the national park, west of the town of Sussex Inlet. Cannabis cultivation for personal use or without a license is illegal in New South Wales, and is an imprisonable offense.\nThe first two plantations were found on 21 January by Nowra police officers and the Rural Fire Service. It was protected by rabbit traps, fences, and wire, and reportedly had several \"established watering systems.\" On 22 January, five more cannabis plantations were found nearby, protected by more animal traps and even trip wires – the police had to winch their way in with helicopters to confiscate some of the plants.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eat My Cookies is the 14th episode from the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on June 4, 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy despite being male tried to attend the Bareette Baret Girls' Camp. The girl scouts demanded that Ren and Stimpy pass several tests being allowed to join. Ren and Stimpy have to sell all of the girl scout cookies, which they instead eat. Ren and Stimpy put cacti in the cookie boxes and sell all of the boxes in this manner. Ren loses the cookie money in a card game. The girl scout leader demands that Stimpy and Ren capture a monstrous creature known as a Snipe. Ren does not believe in Snipes, so Stimpy captures a Snipe alone. The Snipe mauls Ren. Stimpy is given the Snipe Hunting Badge while Ren feels depressed and left out.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nGirl Scout Leader-voice of Rosie O'Donnell\nGirl scouts-voice of Cheryl Chase \nThe badger-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe Games Animation studio, which took over The Ren & Stimpy Show in 1992 divided their stories into \"quicker\" cartoons meant to meet the quota imposed by the Nickelodeon network and the more \"artistic\" cartoons that were given more money and time. Jim Gomez of the Games Animation stated: \"The guys that sort of compromised and did stuff quicker than the other guys were kind of carrying the studio They were meeting the requirements, allowing the other guys to produce the shows at their pace. I'm not blaming anybody, but that's the reality. It might had suffered a bit, which was bad, but it was what it was\". Eat My Cookies was a \"quicker\" cartoon assigned to Ron Hughart who was known as \"the reliable director\" by the network executives. Hughart was a director known for his lack of ego and willingness to take on stories that the other personnel did not want to do. Eat My Cookies was regarded within Games Animation as a \"quicker\" cartoon of low quality which the other directors did not want to take.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski condemned Eat My Cookies as a story devoid of any humor that was just done to meet the quota. Komorowski blamed the poor quality of Eat My Cookies on Hughart who \"lacked the comic sensibility and directorial individuality that Ren & Stimpy cartoons demanded\". \n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "The Northern Cyprus–Turkey relations refer to the bilateral relationship between the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and the Republic of Turkey. These relations are characterized by historical, cultural, and political ties, as well as economic cooperation and shared strategic interests.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nThe roots of the close relationship between Northern Cyprus and Republic of Turkey can be traced back to the Cyprus conflict and subsequent events. Following intercommunal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the 1960s and the coup d'état by Greek nationalists in 1974, Turkey intervened militarily on the island, leading to the de facto division of Cyprus into the Greek Cypriot-controlled Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot-administered TRNC in the northern part of the island. Since then, Turkey has been a key supporter of the Turkish Cypriot community, providing political, economic, and military assistance.\n\n\n== Political relations ==\nPolitical relations between Northern Cyprus and Turkey are characterized by Turkey's unwavering support for the TRNC's political status and recognition. Turkey is one of the few countries that officially recognize the TRNC as a sovereign state. High-level visits between officials of both countries are common, reflecting the close ties and cooperation on various regional and international issues.\n\n\n== Economic cooperation ==\nEconomic cooperation between Northern Cyprus and Turkey is substantial and multifaceted. Turkey is Northern Cyprus's largest trading partner, providing significant financial aid and investment in infrastructure projects, education, and healthcare. Trade agreements and economic partnerships between the two entities facilitate the exchange of goods and services, contributing to the economic development of Northern Cyprus.\n\n\n== Cultural and social ties ==\nCultural and social ties between Northern Cyprus and Turkey are deeply rooted in shared history, language, and ethnicity. Many Turkish Cypriots have familial ties to Turkey, and cultural exchanges, educational programs, and tourism further strengthen these bonds. Turkish culture, language, and media have a significant presence in Northern Cyprus, reflecting the close cultural affinity between the two entities.\n\n\n== Security cooperation ==\nSecurity cooperation between Northern Cyprus and Turkey is crucial for maintaining stability and security in the region. Turkey provides military support and security guarantees to the TRNC, ensuring its defense and protection. Military cooperation agreements between Turkey and Northern Cyprus facilitate joint exercises, training programs, and defense cooperation, enhancing the security capabilities of both entities.\n\n\n== International recognition and diplomacy ==\n\nDespite Turkey's recognition of the TRNC, the international community largely considers Northern Cyprus as part of the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey continues to advocate for the TRNC's recognition and participation in international organizations, citing the need for a comprehensive and fair solution to the Cyprus issue that respects the rights and interests of both communities.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of ambassadors of Turkey to Northern Cyprus\nForeign relations of Northern Cyprus\nForeign relations of Turkey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St John's Church is the parish church of Bellerby, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe first reference to a church in Bellerby is from the 15th century, and in 1474 it was the subject of a papal bull establishing the funding of a resident priest, who would say mass.  It long served as a chapel-of-ease to St Michael's Church, Spennithorne.  It was rebuilt in 1801, and again in 1874.  In 1847, it was licensed for baptisms, marriages and burials.  In 1967, the church was grade II listed.  The church was re-roofed and redecorated in 2005, with a carpet fitted the following year.  The church bell was removed in 2017 as it was unsafe, but was rehung in 2021.The church is built of stone with a Welsh slate roof.  It consists of a three-bay nave with a south porch, a two-bay chancel with a north vestry, and a southwest steeple.  The steeple is octagonal with string courses, louvred openings, and an octagonal spire.  The porch is gabled and has buttresses, and a pointed doorway with a chamfered surround.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bellerby\n\n\n== References ==",

It was abolished in 2010 after the Italian Republic deemed it obsolete.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Italian Regia Aeronautica (\"Royal Air Force\") was established in 1923, and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its founding, the Regia Aeronautica organized the Decennial Air Cruise, a mass transatlantic flight from Orbetello, Italy, to the Century of Progress International Exposition at Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. Consisting of 25 Savoia-Marchetti S.55X double-hulled flying boats under the command of General Italo Balbo, it was the first mass flight to cross the North Atlantic. Departing Orbetello on 1 July 1933 and welcomed enthusiastically during stops it made in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, and particularly the United States, the flight was a propaganda success for Fascist Italy. The flight returned to Italy with stops in the Dominion of Newfoundland, the Azores, and Portugal before concluding at Rome on 12 August 1933.\n\n\n== History ==\nTo grant a special and honorific decoration in memory of participants in the Decennial Air Cruise, the Kingdom of Italy established the Commemorative Medal of the Decennial Air Cruise with Royal Decree Number 1748 of 13 August 1933. The medal was awarded by the Prime Minister of Italy (officially known as the Head of Government, Prime Minister Secretary of State from 1925 to 1943) in memory of those who had lost their lives during the cruise itself.\nAfter deeming the medal obsolete, the Italian Republic abolished it on 13 December 2010.\n\n\n== Eligibiity ==\nEligibility for the medal extended to personnel who had taken part in the Decennial Air Cruise, either in flight, or aboard ships or at bases in support of the flight. Personnel who otherwise had demonstrated particular merit in preparation for or implementation of the flight also qualified for the medal.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Medal ===\nThe medal is a bronze disc with a diameter of 32 millimetres (1.3 in). The obverse depicts an effigy of King Victor Emmanuel III on a fasces and the inscription Vittorio Emanuele III Re d'Italia (\"Vittorio Emanuele III King of Italy\"). The reverse bears the inscriptions Crociera aerea del Decennale (\"Decennial Air Cruise\") and Roma-Chicago-New York-Roma — luglio-agosto 1933-XI (\"Rome-Chicago-New York-Rome – July–August 1933-XI\"), the outline of a Savoia-Marchetti S.55X flying boat, and space to engrave the given name and surname of the recipient of the medal and the justification for the award.\n\n\n=== Ribbon ===\nThe ribbon is scarlet.\n\n\n=== Display ===\nThe medal was worn on the left chest with a scarlet ribbon. The ribbon alone could be worn on the chest instead of the medal.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nErcoli, Ercole (1976).

        "content": "Charles Donald O'Malley (April 1, 1907 – April 6, 1970) was an American Latinist and professor of medical history, recognized as a leading expert on the medicine of the Renaissance and, especially, the work of Vesalius. O'Malley was the president of the History of Science Society for a two-year term from 1967 to 1968)\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCharles Donald O'Malley, a third-generation Californian, was born in Alameda County, California. In 1924 he matriculated at Stanford University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1928 and an M.A. in 1929. From 1929 to 1943 he taught history and Latin at South San Francisco High School and continued advanced studies in his spare time. In 1939 he married Dr. Frances M. Keddie, a dermatologist and dermatological researcher. In 1943 he returned to Stanford University as a doctoral student and graduated with a Ph.D. in 1945 with an outstanding, comprehensive dissertation on the life, thought, and influence of Jacopo Aconcio. Upon completing his Ph.D., Charles D. O'Malley joined in 1945 Stanford University's history department as the department's general expert on Renaissance history. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1952–1953. He and John Bertrand deCusance Morant Saunders (1903–1991) published extensively on Vesalius, Leonardo da Vinci, Gabriele Fallopio, and other famous, Renaissance anatomists. O'Malley was the author or co-author of papers published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Medical History, and several other journals. By 1958 O'Malley had published more than 20 papers directly or indirectly dealing with the life and work of Vesalius. During his career, O'Malley also did noteworthy research on the Spanish physicians Andrés Laguna, Pedro Jimeno, and Bernardino Montaña de Monserrate. For the academic year 1959–1960 O'Malley was a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1960 he became a tenured, full professor in UCLA's division of medical history in the department of anatomy at UCLA. He was eventually promoted to be the head of UCLA's newly created department of medical history, a position which he retained until his sudden death in 1970 in Los Angeles at the age of 63. He lectured at many American universities and also in Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Canada. During the 1950s and 1960s he corresponded extensively with important, medical historians such as John F. Fulton, F. N. L. Poynter, and Charles Singer.In the 1950s Franklin David Murphy, as the chancellor of the University of Kansas at Lawrence, unsuccessfully attempted to recruit O'Malley to become a professor at Lawrence. In 1960 Murphy was appointed the chancellor of UCLA, as well as a professor of medical history. During the 1960s Murphy and O'Malley worked together productively. Murphy with O'Malley's help persuaded the directors of the Wellcome Trust to donate 30,000 objects from the Wellcome Ethnological Collection in London to assist the founding in 1963 of a new UCLA campus museum. The new museum was originally named the \"Laboratory of Ethnic Arts and Technology.\"O'Malley was one of the founding members at the first formal meeting in 1964 of the International Academy of the History of Medicine and was the academy's president from 1967 until his death in 1970.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn 1956 O'Malley was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was an honorary or corresponding member of the Royal Society of Medicine, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries (London), and several other prestigious societies concerned with the history of medicine. In 1965 he received the History of Science Society's Pfizer Award and the Commonwealth Club of California's silver medal. In 1969 he received the Prix Eugène Baie II from the government of Belgium's Antwerp Province. As a posthumous honor, UCLA established the Charles Donald O'Malley Short-Term Research Fellowships.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nO'Malley, C.

        "content": "Boronization is a wall conditioning technique for fusion machines (such as tokamaks), where a thin film of boron is deposited on the walls of the vacuum vessel in order to reduce the impurity content (for example oxygen) which can be deleterious for fusion plasma operation.\nThis technique can be seen as a plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition of boron. The typical workflow involves performing a glow discharge and injecting a gas containing boron into the vacuum vessel chamber.\nBoronization as a wall conditioning technique was first developed for the TEXTOR tokamak at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. It is now a well-established technique and is widely used in many tokamaks in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlow discharge\nSputtering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Francis M. McDonald (1931 – October 8, 2018) was an American jurist who served as chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1999 to 2001. Previously, he served as a state trial judge.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMcDonald was born one of eight children to Francis, an attorney, and Margaret Kelly McDonald. Among his siblings were a teacher, lawyers, an entomologist, and multiple specialists in information technology. As a student at Crosby High School, McDonald met Mary Kelly, who he later married in January 1956.McDonald attended the College of the Holy Cross, where his father and younger brother also had enrolled. In 1953, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) then attended Yale Law School, where he received a Bachelor of Laws (L.L.B.) in 1956. On his wedding day that same year, he gained admission to the Connecticut Bar Association.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nMcDonald was a special agent for the FBI from 1957 to 1958. He then was as a federal prosecutor in Connecticut from 1958 to 1960.\n\n\n== Federal juridical service ==\nGovernor William A. O'Neill appointed McDonald to the Connecticut Superior Court in 1984, and McDonald remained there until 1996, when Governor John G. Rowland appointed him as an associate justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. In October 1999, McDonald was sworn in as chief justice and later retired in January 2001. He replaced Robert J. Callahan as chief justice.Although generally conservative, McDonald sided often with liberal justice Robert Berdon. He became known as a judicial libertarian who frequently dissented from the Court's majority. He was succeeded as chief justice by Associate Justice William Sullivan.McDonald died in Waterbury, Connecticut, on October 8, 2018, from pneumonia complications. He was 87 years old.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dawley Town Hall is an events venue in New Street in Dawley, a settlement in Shropshire, in England.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe venue was commissioned as a temperance hall for the International Organisation of Good Templars.  Their aim was to encourage abstinence from alcohol within the local mining community, and they formed a company to finance and commission the building. The site they selected was an elevated point in Dawley known as Dun Cow Bank.The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the Rector of Church Tilton in Cheshire, the Reverend William Bishton Garnett-Botfield of Decker Hill, on 13 October 1873. It was designed by a Mr Patterson of Wellington in the Gothic Revival style, built by Rowland Smitheman of Broseley in brick with a stucco finish at a cost of £900, and was probably completed sometime in 1874. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto New Street. The central bay featured a round headed doorway with grey brick quoins on the ground floor, and three tall round headed windows on the first floor. The outer bays were also fenestrated by tall round headed windows. There was a gable above which was modillioned and contained a date stone above the central bay. Internally, the principal room was the main hall which was 60 feet (18 m) long and 40 feet (12 m) wide. There was a gallery at the east end and a stage, suitable for an orchestra, at the west end.The building hosted a variety of events, and in 1900 showed its first film.  In 1913, it became the Royal Windsor Variety and Picture Palace, but this closed before the end of the First World War.  The venue then became a theatre, before it was acquired by Dawley Urban District Council, which let it out for a wide variety of events. After the Second World War, these included both Catholic and non-conformist church services.  In November 1962, it hosted the public enquiry into plans for Dawley New Town, which were later realised as Telford.In 2002, the hall became the home of an amateur dramatics group, the Telford Stage School. The school moved out in 2010,  following which, the building was refurbished at a cost of £150,000. Following completion of the works, the building reopened and was made available for local groups so that they could host events. In August 2015, an event was held at the town hall to celebrate the life of the local swimmer, Matthew Webb, who was the first recorded person to swim the English Channel for sport without the use of artificial aids.The town hall annex, immediately to the north of the main building was reopened as a community meeting room, known as Randle House in memory of a former mayor, Malcolm Randle, in February 2022. In November 2023, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, visited the town hall and met with civic leaders and members of the local branch of the Royal British Legion and unveiled a plaque commemorating the 150th anniversary of the building.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mills (Chinese: 南豐紗廠), formerly known as Nang Fung Cotton Mills, located at No. 45 Pak Tin Par Street, Chai Wan Kok, Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong, was founded in 1954 by Chen Din Hwa, known as the \"King of Cotton Yarn\", founder of Nan Fung Group. The total floor area is 24,500 square meters, making it the highest producing textile factory in Hong Kong at the time. Subsequently, Unit 1 to Unit 3 were dismantled after the filming of the fire scene in the 1997 Hong Kong film Lifeline and became the private residential estate Summit Terrace, while Unit 4 to Unit 6 ceased operation in 2008 and were converted into warehouses. \nIn 2014, Nan Fung Cotton Mills began revitalization works, and after completion of the project on December 6, 2018, it opened with spaces for work, a textile cultural and arts center, retail areas, and recreational spaces.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1954, Chen Din Hwa, known as the \"King of Cotton Yarn\" and founder of Nan Fung Group, established Nan Fung Cotton Mills in the industrial area of Pak Tin Par Street in Tsuen Wan. Two years later, the factory was officially put into production, producing four hundred bales of cotton yarn per month at the time. The factory experienced rapid development after its establishment, leading to a shortage of labor. In July 1959, a labor dispute broke out due to the inability to maintain the \"three-shift system\", where workers had to work eight hours per shift.\nIn the 1960s, Nan Fung continued to expand its business and acquired adjacent sites to establish six factories. Unit 6, Unit 4, and Unit 5 were completed in 1961, 1962, and 1970 respectively. During the golden age of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry, Nan Fung Cotton Mills was a leading cotton spinning producer in Hong Kong, renowned for its high annual production volume. At its peak, it produced 30 million pounds of cotton yarn annually, making it one of the top producers in the Hong Kong industry. In 1971, despite the significant slowdown in the development of Hong Kong's cotton spinning industry, Nan Fung Cotton Mills added 3,056 spindles and purchased 9,598 spindles, totaling an additional 12,656 spindles, making it one of the ten cotton spinning factories in Hong Kong to increase spindles among the thirty-plus cotton spinning factories that year; the affiliated weaving mill of Nan Fung Cotton Mills also added 288 looms that year.\nIn the 1980s, various regions across Asia entered industrialization. Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries attracted workers with low labor costs, while Mainland China began its reform and opening-up policy. Meanwhile, labor costs and land prices in Hong Kong continued to rise. Consequently, Hong Kong transitioned into a tertiary industry economy, with the manufacturing sector's contribution to the local GDP beginning to decline, dropping below 20% by 1989. As the manufacturing sector gradually declined, Units 1 to 3 of the factory were left vacant after relocating to the mainland in the 1990s. Following the filming of the final explosive scenes of the movie Lifeline in the factory in 1997, it was demolished and rebuilt as the current Summit Terrace. Units 4 to 6 also ceased spinning operations in 2008, converting the buildings into warehouses.\n\n\n== Revitalization ==\nIn 2014, Nan Fung Group announced the revitalization of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, investing 700 million HKD to transform Units 4, 5, and 6, with a total floor area of 264,000 square feet (24,500 square meters), into a single architectural complex. The revitalization project was completed on December 6, 2018.\n\nDuring the revitalization project, some of the textile factory's original features and designs, such as preserving the walls with green oil stains and using old-style iron frame windows made from the same materials and craftsmanship as before, were retained. Structural reinforcements were made to existing structures, and glass curtain walls were added. For instance, the font of \"Nan Fung Cotton Mills\" on the exterior wall of the factory had been discontinued, requiring remolding during restoration. The iron gates with the Nan Fung textile brand \"Golden Cup\" pattern, as well as the iron gates of Units 5 and the stairs of Unit 4, were also preserved. The factory's atrium utilized a large amount of glass, with skylights installed at the top to introduce natural light.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nAfter the completion of the revitalization project in 2018, the three independent buildings of Nan Fung Cotton Mills were transformed into a single architectural complex, divided into three parts: \"Nan Fung Studios\", \"Unit 6 CHAT\" and \"Nan Fung Store\".\n\n\n=== Nan Fung Studios ===\nNan Fung Studios is a workspace located on the 4th floor of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, serving as an incubation base for entrepreneurs and strategic partners. It opened at the end of 2018. The workspace covers a total area of 15,000 square feet and includes the Nan Fung Studios Lab, operated by the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, for prototype production experiments. The atrium space can be used for meetings, seminars, receptions, and other events.\n\n\n=== CHAT Unit 6 ===\nCHAT Unit 6, located on the 2nd floor, is Hong Kong's first textile culture and art center. It aims to allow visitors to experience the creative spirit of Hong Kong's textile industry in the past and present through activities. It opened to the public on July 28, 2018, and officially opened in March 2019.\n\n\n=== Nan Fung Store ===\nNan Fung Store is the retail space of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, covering an area of 126,000 square feet. It offers approximately 60 shops and opened at the end of 2018. The tenants inside the venue have unique characteristics that align with the theme of integrating old and new elements of Nan Fung Cotton Mils. Tenants' lease terms range from 1 to 3 years, and shop rents vary depending on the industry.\n\nAs of April 2019, operational tenants include furniture stores, fashion boutiques, lifestyle shops, Thai massage parlors, traditional dessert shops, vegetarian restaurants, and local Hong Kong brands focusing on design and products. By May of the same year, a 7,000-square-foot nature-themed family park called The Big Things opened on the 2nd floor, equipped with a restaurant and cooking classroom.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Annex at The Mills ===\nThe Annex at The Mills is located on Level M of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, with a total usable area of 3,348 square feet. It can be used for meetings, seminars, lectures, and training courses. One of the rooms is equipped with movable soundproof walls, which can be divided into up to 3 rooms.\n\n\n=== Outdoor spaces ===\nIn addition, the rooftops of Units 6 and 4 have been transformed into \"Cotton Mill Park\" and \"Cotton Mill Farmland\", respectively, while the private alley between Units 6 and 5 has been widened into a public space called \"Pak Tin Par\". Cotton Mills Park, created from the rooftop of Unit 6, allows visitors to enjoy the view of Nan Fung Cotton Mills. Inside the park is a large-scale art piece called \"Traces of Weaving\" approximately 4 meters by 23 meters, created by Lam Tung Pang and COLLECTIVE. The artwork tells the story of fabric. \n\nCotton Mills Farmland is located on the rooftop of Unit 4 and is available for rent for crop planting. Pak Tin Par space is created by widening the private alley between Units 6 and 5. Murals created by six local artists line the alley, depicting the past, present, and future of Nan Fung Cotton Mills. Adjacent to the alley entrance of Nan Fung Cotton Mills is a giant portrait painting titled \"Nameles Heroes,\" created by Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, symbolizing the memories of the previous generation of Hong Kong's struggles and paying tribute to former textile industry workers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Interior decorations ===\nAfter revitalization, Nan Fung Cotton Mills adopts a \"Cultural and Creative x Historical x Industrial style\", becoming a cultural and creative space in the Tsuen Wan community and a new landmark in Tsuen Wan. During revitalization, Nan Fung Cotton Mills specially invited renowned engraver Wu Ding Keung to create some engraving templates for the textile factory, which became signage for the factory. The bright red tools called \"Tai Ping Bucket\" formerly used for fire rescue, together with discarded wooden door panels from the factory, became decorations for the signage inside Nan Fung Cotton Mills. Apart from showcasing the past of the textile factory, it also prevents historical artifacts from being wasted or discarded. The white checkered brick wall outside the restroom of Nan Fung Cotton Mills has become a popular spot for photography.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn the evening of May 6, 2020, Carrie Lam, the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong, posted a photo on her Facebook page, indicating that she had visited one of the mask production points. As the background of the photo matched that of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, the mask production point was thus identified as Nan Fung Cotton Mills. Subsequently, a reporter from HK01 visited the shared space on the 4th floor of Nan Fung Cotton Mills and found that one of the workspaces had been set up as a production workshop for copper-core anti-epidemic masks. Several staff and security guards then expelled the reporter, and the room was sealed with plywood.\nLater, Ming Pao checked the revitalization deed of Nan Fung Cotton Mills in 2018 and found that although Unit 4 and 5 factories where the masks were made could be used for research institutes, design and development centers, training centers, recreational, sports, and cultural activities, shops, and catering services, they could not be used for \"industrial purposes\". Therefore, manufacturing masks there was suspected of violating the deed. Ming Pao also checked the relevant lease, which stated that Nan Fung Cotton Mills (No. 2) Co., Ltd. leased the Unit 4 and 5 factories to Nan Fung Workshop Incubation Center Ltd. for HK$120,000 per month, and it was stipulated that the Unit 4 and 5 factories could only be used for research institutes, design and development centers, training centers, or for leisure, sports, and cultural purposes, and not for other purposes. Land and construction lawyer Tse Tin Leung believed that the textile factory could only produce small samples, and large-scale production might violate the deed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNan Fung Cotton Mills provides a shuttle service with red minibuses, shuttling between Nan Fung Cotton Mills and MTR Tsuen Wan Station. It officially commenced service on December 1, 2019. The waiting area at Tsuen Wan Station is located opposite the Tsuen Wan Government Office near Exit A4 of Tsuen Wan Station, while the waiting area at Nan Fung Cotton Mills is located inside the parking lot. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes, and the service is free of charge. The appearance of Nan Fung Cotton Mills minibuses is different from ordinary minibuses. The body of the minibus bears the name and logo of Nan Fung Cotton Mills, and the front of the minibus has traditional minibus stop signs indicating \"Free\" and \"Come over, see things, buy things, eat things\". \n\nIn addition, as Nan Fung Cotton Mills is located in the industrial area of Pak Tin Par Street in Tsuen Wan, visitors can reach Nan Fung Cotton Mills via the pedestrian footbridge from Exit A3 of Tsuen Wan Station or along Tai Chung Road from Exit A2 of Tsuen Wan West Station. Moreover, there are many bus and minibus routes passing by the Tsuen Wan section of Castle Peak Road opposite Nan Fung Cotton Mills. Visitors can take the relevant transportation and alight near Nan Fung Cotton Mills (such as at Tsuen King Circuit Footbridge Bus Stop) and then walk to the destination.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Awards ==\nDuring and after the revitalization project, Nan Fung Cotton Mills received the following awards:\n\n2015 Hong Kong Institute of Planners Annual Award.\nLEED Gold Certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.\nConstruction Industry Council Sustainable Building Award.\nMIPIM Asia Awards 2018 – Bronze Award for Best Renovated Building.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website - The Mills (in Chinese).\n香港旅遊發展局網站對南豐紗廠的介紹 (in Chinese).\n南豐紗廠免費穿梭巴士服務時間表 (in Chinese).\n【復活節活動2019】荃灣南豐紗廠新店！交通＋打卡位！, Weekend Weekly (in Chinese).",

His tenure lasted from 1869 to 1871, a period during which the Meiji government made the decision to eliminate all domains across the country.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nHitotsuyanagi Yoriaki was born on July 15, 1858, the third son of the 8th lord of the domain, Hitotsuyanagi Yorisugu. The identity of his mother remains unknown, adding mystery to his lineage. In February 1868, Yoriaki traveled to Kyoto for his ailing father and returned to his domain by April. After his father's death on December 7, 1869, Yoriaki inherited the clan estate and became Imperial Governor, also earning the title of Jugoi. In 1871, Yoriaki was dismissed due to the dissolution of feudal domains and the establishment of prefectures. He retired in June 1874, passing on his responsibilities to his younger brother Hitotsuyanagi Tsugumune. Yoriaki joined a branch clan of the Hitotsuyanagi clan in 1885. He died at the age of 63 on January 16, 1920, leaving behind a legacy marked by transitions in the socio-political landscape.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the Han system\nHitotsuyanagi clan\nKomatsu Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Quenby Mall, now known as Stanly County Commons, was a shopping mall located in  Stanly County, North Carolina, United States. It was anchored by Belk, JCPenney, and Harris Teeter.  The mall opened in 1966, and it was sold to Stanly County for their use in 1993. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nPlans for the construction of the Quenby Mall were announced by Masten-Langston Faison Co, based out of Charlotte, North Carolina in December 1965. The center was aimed to be 160,000 square feet, featuring Belks, Harris Teeter and W. T. Grant as anchor stores. The mall was designed to resemble that of an old English Village, with brickwork walls, planters, and exposed wooden beams being used to compliment the style. Ground was broken in December 1965, between North First and North Second streets in Albemarle, North Carolina. This was one of the earliest examples of an enclosed mall in North Carolina, predicted to be number 5 by the time of its opening.\nThe malls grand opening happened on September 29, 1966, opening with 5 stores. Belks, W. T. Grants, Friedman's Jewelers, Royce Shoes and Eckerd Drug opened with the mall, meanwhile Harris Teeter and other smaller shops were still finishing construction. In addition, a Hardee's was located as an outparcel of the mall, and had been open for several months prior to the grand opening.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nFollowing the closure of the W. T. Grant store at the mall, department store JCPenney would announce plans to locate at the mall in September 1976. The renovations would complete, and JCPenney had a grand opening on January 26, 1977.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nOn  July 3, 1980, Belk at the Quenby Mall closed in favor of the location at the new Albemarle Mall, which was scheduled to open on July 30 of that year.\nThe mall would undergo a renovation in 1983, brought upon by its then owners Stephen D Bell & Company, based out of Greensboro, North Carolina. Improvements included a new ceiling, new lighting, new flooring and the addition of heating and air conditioning.\nTwo businesses: Burney's and Minor Things, would open up at the mall on March 23, 1985. Minor Things was an apparel shop selling children's clothes and shoes, meanwhile Burney's featured outdoor activity gear.\nIn 1987, JCPenney closed their doors at the Quenby Mall, and hosted a fixture sale in their former store in November of that year.\nIn 1988, the mall would be put up for sale, with several proposed ideas including changing the mall into a mixed use center.\nFollowing JCPenney's departure, both Harris-Teeter and Eckerd Drug would leave the mall for a new strip center across town in 1989. This would leave the mall anchorless.\nFirst Union Bank would consolidate their Quenby Mall Branch into another location, closing operations at the mall in early 1989.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the 1990s, the mostly empty shopping mall was attracting interest by the local government to house the health department and other county offices.\nA restaurant known as Dinner Bell located at the Quenby Mall, opening in July 1992. They were allowed to stay after the county's renovations.\nStanly County's intentions to purchase the mall were being finalized in late 1992, and completed on January 24, 1993. The mall was purchased by the county for a total of $1.3 million, and they went on to perform over $2 million in renovations on the property to get it suited to their needs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The attacks on the northern border of Ecuador in 2018 were a series of terrorist attacks that took place in the towns of San Lorenzo, Mataje and Viche in the Esmeraldas Province, Northern Ecuador. The attacks began on January 7, 2018, outside the facilities of the San Lorenzo National Police district where, in the early morning hours, a car bomb exploded leaving 28 people injured, as well as severe damage to the infrastructure of the police precinct and 37 homes in the vicinity. In preliminary investigations, Ecuadorian authorities linked this incident to criminal organizations linked to drug trafficking and the illegal drug trade.\nIn the days following the attack in San Lorenzo, several minor attacks began to be recorded. On March 22, another explosion occurred from a bombing located on the side of the San Lorenzo-Mataje highway, which caused the death of 3 marines, in addition to leaving 7 more injured. The crisis worsened on March 26 with the kidnapping and murders of journalists from El Comercio, who were covering a report on the events that were taking place in Mataje and its surroundings.\nThe kidnapping and subsequent murder of the journalists, as well as the responsibility for several of the attacks, have been attributed to the Oliver Sinisterra Front, a dissident group of the Daniel Aldana Mobile Column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who refused to lay down their arms, refusing to accept the peace agreements between this guerrilla and the Colombian government, calling themselves an \"active front\", but Colombia does not call them an insurgent group but rather a criminal group, calling it a Residual Organized Armed Group (GAOR).\nIt is believed by the government that it was not only the Oliver Sinesterra Front involved, but that the Mantaro Rojo Base Committee and the Defense Front of People's Struggles of Ecuador also participated.\n\n\n== Attack in San Lorenzo ==\n\nOn Saturday, January 27, 2018, at 01:40 in the morning, a car bomb exploded  in the parking lot behind the headquarters building of the San Lorenzo District Police Command, in the San Lorenzo Canton, Esmeraldas Province, near the Colombia–Ecuador border. The detonation affected the structure of the police precinct, destroying the rear wall and windows of the building where the dining room and bedrooms function; In addition, it affected 37 surrounding homes that were located within a radius of 50 metres. There were no fatalities, however, it left 28 people injured, of which 14 were police officers who were in the building.\nThe injured were immediately treated at the Divina Providencia hospital and at the health center in that town. Due to their minor injuries, they were discharged around noon. The report on the material damage was given by Police Colonel Richard Carolys, while the evaluation and actions at the scene included the participation of military personnel from the Ecuadorian Navy.\nPresident Lenín Moreno signed the same day the decree of state of exception valid for 60 days only with effect in the cantons of San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro in an attempt to strengthen security in the area. The first theories about the attack postulated that the attack was carried out by criminal organizations linked to drug trafficking.\nFirst attacks on the Army\nOn February 19, 2018, two soldiers were injured in an attack with artisanal mortars by dissidents of the former FARC guerrilla against Ecuadorian soldiers in the Pan zone in Esmeraldas Province. The uniformed men suffered minor injuries.\n\n\n== Attack in Borbón ==\n48 days after the attack in San Lorenzo, on Saturday, March 17, 2018, around 02:30 in the morning, another detonation was recorded near a naval checkpoint of the Ecuadorian Navy in the town of Borbón, in the Eloy Alfaro canton. The explosive device was homemade and consisted of a cable that was connected at one end to a jute bag loaded with gunpowder, and the other end connected to an electricity meter of a church located 100 meters from the checkpoint according to the respective police report. There were no fatalities or serious injuries, but there was material damage to infrastructure. The explosion affected the surrounding area smashing the windows of the Fire Department building, the Parish Government, the communal house and other surrounding homes. Only three sailors were slightly injured after the attack and the collapse of part of the wall of that military post was reported.\nThe attack occurred while an operation called \"Libertador\" was being carried out in several towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Guayas, which included the participation of 13 tax agents from the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia and elements from the Colombian Prosecutor's Office and from the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Authorities considered that the objective of the attack was to create a distraction during the raids resulting from the operation. After the operation, 20 homes were raided (18 in Esmeraldas, 2 in Guayas) and 5 people linked to Walter Patricio Arízala Vernaza  (Alias Guacho) were arrested, who was suspected of being responsible for the attack in San Lorenzo.\n\n\n== Minor incidents in Alto Tambo and El Pan ==\nAfter the attack in Borbón, on Sunday, March 18, two incidents occurred in the San Lorenzo canton. The first occurred in the town of El Pan, near the Colombian-Ecuadorian border, where Ecuadorian military personnel patrolling the area received an attack of gunfire coming from some homes. The shots were fired from a rifle against the patrol that was transporting the soldiers and then they received a burst of mortars. As a result of the shooting, two soldiers received minor injuries from flying shrapnel. On that same day, at approximately 9:30 in the morning, a second incident was also recorded through a detonation of a homemade explosive in a patrol car belonging to the UPC Alto Tambo in the El Pan parish, in the San Lorenzo canton.\n\n\n== Attack in Mataje ==\nOn Tuesday, March 20, 2018, there was a detonation of an explosive device placed on the San Lorenzo-Mataje highway, where military vehicles with Army troops were passing with the aim of continuing with the operations to control the situation.\n\n\n== Kidnapping and murders of journalists from the newspaper El Comercio ==\n\nOn March 26, 2018, three workers from the newspaper El Comercio r, were kidnapped. They were 32 year old journalist Javier Ortega, 46 year old photographer Paúl Rivas and 60 year old driver Efraín Segarra. The team was working on reports about the violence that had occurred weeks before in that area.\nThe kidnapping occurred after passing the last military checkpoint in the town of Mataje, in Esmeraldas, a province in the region of the Colombia–Ecuador border.\n\nOn April 3, the Colombian network RCN broadcast a video of the three kidnapped Ecuadorians, in which journalist Javier Ortega said:\"Mr. President Lenín Moreno our lives are in your hands. The only thing they want is the exchange of their three detainees in Ecuador for our three lives to return safely to their families and, also the annulment of the terrorism agreement between Ecuador and Colombia.\".The video also mentioned that the perpetrators of the kidnapping was the group called the Oliver Sinisterra Front, led by the Ecuadorian Alias Guacho, a dissident of the demobilized Colombian FARC guerillas.\nOn April 12, the RCN network received photographs of what were presumed to be the bodies of the three kidnapped people. At first, the government authorities and the Ecuadorian president did not confirm the veracity of the photographs, giving them a period of 12 hours to provide evidence that the three captives were still alive.\nOn April 13, President Moreno confirmed the murder of the three Ecuadorians and announced a military operation against illegal groups in the border area with Colombia. Likewise, as a result of these events, the Ecuadorian president ordered the suspension of the peace talks in Quito between the Colombian government and the ELN guerrilla that were taking place in this country, also withdrawing as guarantor of the process. The bodies of the journalistic group were recovered in Ecuador on the Fuerza Pública de Colombia. On June 21, their identities were confirmed. For its part, the Ecuadorian government sent a note of protest to the Colombian government for the handling of information on Social media, bypassing the respective diplomatic channel.\n\n\n== Kidnapping and murders of a couple on the border ==\nShortly after the murder of the journalists, the National Secretariat of Communication of Ecuador issued a statement on Twitter in which it declared that two more people had been kidnapped.  The couple were Ecuadorian nationals Oscar Efrén Villacís Gómez and Katty Vanesa Velasco Pinargote. This occired in the midst of joint military operations carried out by Ecuador and Colombia following the murder of the two journalists and their driver. President Lenin Moreno had given a statement on Monday declaring a period of 10 days to surrender and Ecuador put a reward of US$100,000 and calling the kidnappers \"cowards because they use human shields to want to blackmail the Ecuadorian people.\" This was shocking because even during the most severe parts of the Colombian conflict, Ecuador had remained almost immune to the violence occurring on the other side of its northern border. On July 4, the Colombian Government confirmed that the two bodies found in the city of Tumaco, in the southwest of the country, later identified as the two kidnapped Ecuadorian citizens. Following this military operations in the border area were strengthened. Paradoxically, it was the signing of the peace agreements in Colombia in 2016 that seems to have change the situation.\n\n\n== Injured victims ==\nThe first injured victims were recorded on January 7, 2018, after the first attack in San Lorenzo, where 28 people were affected, 14 of them being police officers who were in the police building. The injuries were minor and the vast majority were treated at the Divina Providencia Hospital and the San Lorenzo health center.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2018 in Ecuador\nWar on drugs in Ecuador\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Pioneer is a bronze sculpture of a 49er of the California Gold Rush. The statue was created in 1925 by Henry Lion and has long been a landmark of the Carthay Circle, Los Angeles neighborhood in California, United States, except for a brief period in 2008 when it was stolen. It was recovered at a scrap metal yard by the LAPD art-theft division and was reinstalled in January 2009. Created as an homage to the father of the founder of the Carthay Circle district, the statue is sometimes called Dan the Miner after its subject, Daniel O'Connell McCarthy. Originally part of a fountain opposite Carthay Circle Theatre, it was moved to the pocket park at McCarthy Vista and San Vicente Boulevard in 1969. The Pioneer was one of three California-historic-nostalgia monuments in the original layout of Carthay Circle, along with a boulder honoring Jedediah Smith and a sundial made of bricks of Mission San Juan Capistrano.Lion told Betty Hoag in 1964 for the Archives of American Art oral history project, \"[The Pioneer] was a competition, national competition, which I happened to win in 1924. I was just out of Otis; I was 25 years old. It was an anonymous competition and there was a thousand dollar prize in addition to the commission to do it. They gave me the commission and this seven-foot bronze was cast in New York by the Rollin Bronze Works.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nStatue of Harrison Gray Otis - another Los Angeles bronze, partially stolen in 2024 for scrap value\n\n\n== References ==",

The system focuses on replicating natural systems of accumulation of nutrients in ecosystems, replicating secondary succession, in order to create productive forest ecosystems that produce food, ecosystem services and other forest products.The system relies heavily on several processes: \n\nDense planting mixing perrinneal and annual crops\nRapid cutting and composting of fast growing pioneer species, to accumulate nutrients and biomass\nCreating greater water retention on the land through improving penetration of water into soil and plant water cyclingThe systems were first developed in tropical Brazil, but many similar systems have been tested in temperate environments as soil and ecosystem restoration tactics.The framework for the syntropic agroforestry is advocated for by Agenda Gotsch an organization built to promote the systems.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz (1475 – 16th century) was a noble from the House of Medrano in the independent Kingdom of Navarre. He was a knight of Navarre, a royal guard of the king, captain of the kings standing army, alcaide and mayor of Amaiur-Maya and one of the leading defenders of the Navarrese crown against the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre. Jaime Vélaz de Medrano is believed to have served as the alcaide of Maya Castle from 2 October 1521, to 19 July 1522.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nThe Medrano family is a very ancient house of noble origin, it is found in different times and in different places. Many principles are attributed to them by authors and historians \"for its antiquity, its splendor, for their military prowess and virtue and for every other value of chivalry that prospered with this family, in great numbers, magnificent and generous.\" Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz is described as an exemplary model of knights and of unconditional loyalty, who defended the castle of Maya: \n\n\"...in this last act of resistance to the power of Carlos V. The memory of these martyrs of Navarrese liberty, models of fidelity and knights, [Medrano] must be revered and held as one of the purest glories of that nobility.\"\n\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano stands out as a defining figure of his time. Born at the Palace of Velaz de Medrano around 1475 into a rich and warrior family of the Navarrese high nobility, Medrano's life spanned crucial battles and political turmoil as he fought to keep the Kingdom of Navarre independent. Known as Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Etxauz (Echauz), he became a symbol of Navarrese identity. Driven by profound loyalty, and marked by virtue, Medrano's enduring legacy is his unwavering resistance to Spanish conquest, embodying the spirit of Navarre's struggle for sovereignty.\n\n\n== Military career (1507–1521) ==\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano was primarily a noble trained for warfare, deeply rooted in the Agramontese tradition, and even served in the personal royal guard of King John III of Navarre. He was ordained a knight in Navarre around 1496 (roughly 21 years old). Recognized for his leadership, he was named captain of the Hermandad, the kingdom's standing army, by the Cortes in 1507. Distinguished from many Navarrese nobles, Jaime Vélaz de Medrano consistently represented the independence of Navarre and loyalty to its crown, rejecting any offers from Fernando el Católico that would acknowledge him as the king of Navarre. He emerged as a charismatic leader of the Navarrese resistance, leading his own army to defend Upper Navarre's last bastion.\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz was a key figure in the Kingdom of Navarre who directly experienced the major military events that occurred, Medrano was present in all of them. Jaime Vélaz de Medrano raised an army with his relatives and participated in the uprising of Estella-Lizarra. He would also attempt to recapture Pamplona in 1512, defended Amaiur-Maya the following year, then went into exile. He returned with the marshal and narrowly escaped the disaster of Isaba in 1516. He once again returned, this time with Lesparre in 1521, where he would defend Estella. Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz also fought in the important battle of Noáin on 30 June 1521 with his close friend and comrade Juan Remírez de Baquedano, lord of San Martín de Ameskoa, who perished in battle in Irun.\nOn 30 June 1521, the Franco-Navarrese forces led by Asparrot suffered a pivotal defeat on the plains of Noain near Iruña/Pamplona, leading to the retreat of King Enrique de Albret's loyalists. That autumn, the defeated troops, under Marshal Bonnivet, reclaimed parts of the Navarrese Pyrenees, culminating in the 29 September 1521 siege of Amaiur Castle, and on 2 October 1521, Medrano would take up government in Amaiur-Maya.The battle of Amaiur-Maya in 1522 marked the height of his career.\nAfter the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre (1512–24), Lower Navarre was restored to the rule of the native king, Henry II. Its capitals were Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and Saint-Palais.\n\n\n== The battle of Amaiur-Maya (1522) ==\n\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano served as the alcaide of Maya Castle from 2 October 1521, to 19 July 1522. In the Baztán valley's fortress of Maya, 200 Agramontese knights and 8 or 9 nobles led by Jaime Vélaz de Medrano defended the Castle of Amaiur-Maya against the forces sent by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. By 4 July 1522, a Castilian expedition left from Pamplona, and by 15 July Amaiur was invested. Medrano's entourage included the brothers Miguel de Jaso and Juan de Azpilicueta, along with their cousin Juan de Olloqui, vigorously they defended an independent Navarre. For ten months, they resisted a siege by an army 5000 strong with heavy artillery. By 19 July 1522, Jaime was forced to negotiate a surrender to the new viceroy, the Count of Miranda, and his ally, the Count of Lerín, Don Luis de Beaumont. This surrender marked the final conflict between the Beaumont and Agramont factions, concluding a sixty-year feud that had fueled devastating civil wars and led to the fall of the Old Pyrenean Kingdom. \n\nAn obelisk was designed to commemorate the battle of Amaiur-Maya on top of where the castle of Maya used to be. Carved on the monolith are the names of: Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, the castle's Alcaide, his son Luis Vélaz de Medrano, Miguel de Jaso, brother of San Francisco Javier, Juan de Olloqui, Juan de Azpiliketa, Luis de Mauleón, Victor de Mauleón, and other Navarrese. \nHistorians note that the tenacity of the Navarrese was remarkable: enduring 9 days of relentless bombardment using rudimentary weapons like stones, crossbows, and possibly a musket, along with tar. Despite facing a force of five thousand fighters equipped with 16 cannons and 300 ladders to seize the castle, they displayed uncommon resolve. Their breach into the fortress was facilitated by a Guipuzcoan named Mendizabal, who planted explosives on one of the castle's towers. Otherwise, their entry would have been impossible. When the Spanish viceroy expressed surprise at the fierce resistance of the Amaiur defenders, the Count of Lerín, hailing from Beaumont, remarked, \"Those, my lord, are Navarrese.\"\nThe conflict resulted in numerous casualties on both sides. Medical supplies were sent to a field hospital to treat hundreds for severe injuries, including burns and injuries from destroyed artillery. In the aftermath, instructions were issued to compensate certain individuals with 1 ducat each for burying the dead at the Amaiur church.\nAdditionally, Diego de Medrano was paid for provisioning 39 prisoners, while the remaining captives had perished in the battle. These prisoners were subsequently transferred to the San Nicolas prison in Pamplona, where they faced strict penalties. Despite the Viceroy Count of Miranda's efforts to protect them, some accounts report Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz and his son Luis were found deceased later that month, suspected to have been poisoned, however there is limited information to verify this.\n\n\n=== Agramont and Beaumont ===\n\nSince the mid-15th century, Navarre experienced significant instability regarding its throne, leading to a split among its nobility into two opposing factions during the War of the Bands: the Beaumonts and the Agramonts. This division had widespread effects both within Navarre and in the broader Basque Country, leaving the region vulnerable to external influences. \nThe Agramontese faction was represented by prominent figures such as Marshal Pierre de Navarre, Viscount of Muruzubal and Val d’Ilzarbe, Alphonse de Peralta, Count of Sant-Esteban, and Jaime's brother Juan Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz, Lord of Learza and Iguzquiza, among others. They were joined by notable lords and viscounts, including the Baron of Ezpeleta and various merinos and alcaides like Pierre de Peralta of Tudela.\nIn contrast, the Beaumont faction, supporting the constable, included close family and principal captains such as Charles, Philippe, and Jean de Beaumont, his son Louis, and his son-in-law Jean de Mendoza, along with other distinguished lords and barons from regions like Ostabat, Monteagudo, and Béhorléguy.\n\n\n=== Letters of Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz ===\n\nAritz Otazu, through his publishing house Mintzoa, has released a facsimile edition of the previously unknown letters from the last defenders of Amaiur Castle, entitled \"The Letters from Amaiur in 1521-22.\" They provide a first-person account of the events at Amaiur, offering valuable insights into the historical narrative of that period. Historian Peio Monteano provided an analysis of these documents, which reveal the sentiments of loyalty and national identity among the Navarrese during a tumultuous time marked by the battle of Noáin in 1521. This edition, limited to a hundred copies, reveals a pivotal moment in Navarrese history.\nA notarized, numbered collection of the personal correspondence of Jaime Vélaz de Medrano are preserved. Medrano provides historians with 51 letters authored by key legitimist figures such as the Lord of Xavier, the notaries of Etxalar and Elizondo, the son of Marshal Pedro de Navarra, the abbot of Urdax, Antonio de Peralta, and Henry II, King of Navarre, along with correspondence from France's leading lieutenants. The letters are encased in a box featuring a gold-plated, metal-enriched coat of arms of Jaime Vélaz de Medrano. These letters, crucial historical records written by the figures themselves, are the sole surviving firsthand accounts from that era. Accompanying these letters, written in Béarnese, Occitan, French, and Old Spanish, is a book that includes research studies, transcriptions, and translations into both modern Spanish and Basque, documenting the Navarrese resistance. \n\n\n=== Correspondences of Jaime Vélaz de Medrano ===\n\nMedrano's correspondence emerged at a time when Navarre had just undergone the battle of Noáin in June 1521, and except for two letters from between 1500 and 1512, all the rest are from November 1521 to seven days before the fall of the castle of Amaiur. The letters are important because \"they talk about war plans, the positions of the enemies, the feelings of the resistors, where they are.\" A letter from the Lord of Bonnivet, Admiral of France, to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, alcaide of Maya, informs him of the dispatch of the comptroller to pay the garrison of the castle, to be reduced to 100 soldiers, and of the shipment of provisions. Another letter from Clement Le Jarc to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano informs him of the dispatch of 20 escudos in payment for the cider and requesting a report of the provisions received. A letter dated 30 November 1521, this time from the Lord of Saint André, lieutenant of Guyenne, to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, informs him of his departure to Bayonne with the Lord of Bonnivet, Admiral of France, and the needs for the defense of the fortress of Maya. \nOne letter dated 29 December 1521 from Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, mayor of Maya, reveals he threatened Miguel de Espinal, vicar of Espinal, to reveal the origin of the false rumor about the castle being put up for sale for 4,000 ducats, however the vicar of Espinal denied his responsibility for the false rumor of the sale of the castle and responded to his threats on 30 December 1521. There is even a letter dated 26 March 1522 from King Henry II of Navarre to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, regarding the oath of fidelity of the inhabitants of Cinco Villas, Baztán and Tierra de Lerín and to request an end to mistreatment. Another letter from Henry II of Navarre to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano on 26  March 1522 informs him of the dispatch of the Lord of Gelás, his chief squire, with news on his behalf.\nOne dated 7 April 1522 from Juan de Orbara, abbot of Urdax, to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, seeks to obtain information about the concentration of troops in Pamplona. There is word from Juan de Orbara, abbot of Urdax, to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, Juan requested that supplies be sent to Miguel de Javier, lord of Javier, and to the garrison of the church of Ciga. \n\nA crucial letter dated 6 July 1522 from Juan de Orbara, abbot of Urdax, to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano, informs him of the departure from Pamplona of the army led by the Count of Miranda, Viceroy of Navarre, and Luis de Beaumont, Count of Lerín. Jaime's relative Juana de Echauz, lady of Ezpeleta, wrote to Jaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz, she informed him of the imminent attack by the Spanish and the arrival of the substitute for the Lord of Saint André, lieutenant of Guyenne. Before the battle of Amaiur-Maya, Jaime received letters from Miguel de Javier, lord of Javier, warning him about the leakage of information regarding their positions by the wine carriers.\nFollowing the siege of Amaiur, the Spanish military confiscated Medrano's letters to track down and penalize their authors, as notes on the documents suggest. Historian Peio Monteano explains that these letters were later placed in the care of Juan Rena, an army paymaster who later became the bishop of Pamplona. Rena was tasked with overseeing the assets seized from those who resisted the Spanish conquest. After his death, by imperial decree, these documents were moved to the Chamber of Accounts’ archive. There, amidst extensive administrative records, the letters remained overlooked for almost four centuries, as detailed in Monteano's analysis accompanying the correspondence.\n\n\n== Family background ==\n\nJaime descends from the ancient and noble House of Medrano, ricohombres and lords of Igúzquiza and Learza who held a family seat in the Palace of Vélaz de Medrano in the Kingdom of Navarre. His father Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano y Goñi, Lord of Learza, Igúzquiza, Agos and Aguinano, Alcaide of the castle of Monjardin, was an important member of the royal Navarrese court during the reign of John III of Navarre and Dona Catherine of Navarre. His mother was Doña Elvira de Echauz y Beaumont, daughter of Carlos, Viscount de Baigner (Baigorri) and Juana Margarita de Beaumont, sister of the first Count of Lerín, Luis de Beaumont.\nThe Vélaz de Medrano family, lords of Igúzquiza, were entrusted by the Navarrese monarchs with organizing the defense of the Santesteban de la Solana valley, operating from their palace which also served as an armory (Cabo de Armeria). Following the 1512 invasion of Navarre, this palace became crucial during the Merindad Uprising and the Insurrection of Navarre. Facing external threats, the lords rallied their kin, distributed weapons, and formed their own army to unite with forces from other Navarrese valleys. However, after Navarre's defeat, The Medrano fortresses of Vélaz de Medrano and Monjardin, along with others like Cabrega, and Aberin, was captured and heavily damaged by the invaders. In 1521, with Navarre's brief restoration of independence, the fortress of Vélaz de Medrano resumed its key role in defending the legitimist cause. At the door of their palace enclosure you can see the noble coat of arms of the Velaz de Medrano family who were lords of Iguzquiza and Learza.\nThe noble Medrano family were deeply loyal and even related to the Navarrese and French monarchs, when the last French ruler from the House of Capet fell, Jaime's direct ancestor Juan Martínez de Medrano y Aibar was elected by the Navarrese Cortes as regent of the Kingdom in the year 1328, while Queen Dona Juana, who was in Paris, was unable to assume the throne.\n\n\n=== Siblings ===\n\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz was the younger brother of Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz, sixth of the same name, Lord of Learza, Igúzquiza and Agos, alcaide of the castles of Del Castillo, Santacara and Monjardin, in addition to being the major knight of King John III of Navarre, who gave him in 1496 the property that belonged to Langarot de Yaniz, who was declared a traitor. \nThe Prince of Viana granted the Santacara estate and its royal castle to Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz, a member of the Beaumont family. In 1500, Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano resided at the castle for eight to ten years, remaining loyal to the Navarrese monarchs. In October 1512, he rebelled against the invading forces of Fernando el Católico from Castile and Aragon. Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano valiantly resisted the Castilian conquest and, following the successful takeover of Navarre by Fernando el Católico, he followed his rightful king into exile in France. Stationed in France, Jaime, Juan and Julián Íñiguez de Medrano participated in the effort to reclaim the Navarrese throne. \nThe second Count of Lerín allied himself with Juan de Aragón, who married him to his natural daughter, thereby securing the Count's loyalty to the King of Aragon and his brother-in-law, Fernando el Católico. When expelled from Navarre, the Count was compensated by the Catholic King with the marquisate of Huéscar in Granada, but lost his Navarrese titles and lands. It was then that Juan Velaz de Medrano assumed command of Santacara Castle, where he had been since 1500. The castle fell to Castilian forces in December 1512. As noted by Jerónimo Zurita in the Annals of the Crown of Aragon, several castles including those of Sancho Abarca, Mélida, and Santacara, among others, were demolished in December 1512 after Navarre's unsuccessful bid for independence.\nHis brother Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz married with Dona Ana de Mauleon y Navarra, daughter of Landron de Mauleon y Claver and Juana de Navarra y Enriquez de Lacarra. Juana de Navarra was the daughter of Pedro de Navarra y Peralta, III Viscount of Muruzábal and Inés Enríquez de Lacarra y Foxan. The Viscount of Muruzabal takes its name from an old royal manor town called Muruzábal. In 1407, King Carlos III included it within the viscount created in favor of his brother Prince Leonel de Navarra, both sons of Charles II of Navarre. \nAfter the conquest of Navarre, the king and queen decreed restrictions on travel for several notable figures, including mossen Juan Velaz de Medrano. He was prohibited from visiting Pamplona, Puente-la-Reina, and Huarte-Araquil, among other locations under the constable's control, except for significant events such as the entry and coronation of Their Highnesses in Pamplona. In 1543, there are records of his son Juan Velaz de Medrano y Mauleon y Navarra, Lord of Orendain, Agos, Learza, Igúzquiza, Aguiñaro (Arguiñano), Arróniz, and Zabala (Zabalza); he was the 7th of this name.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz was the son of the noble Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano and Dona Elvira de Echauz y Beaumont. He was a descendant of the distinguished and noble lineage of Medrano in Igúzquiza, first established in the ancient Palace of Vélaz de Medrano. \n\n\n=== Paternal ancestry ===\n\nHe was the paternal grandson of Don Ferran Vélaz de Medrano and Elvira de Goñi. His paternal grandfather Don Ferran Velaz de Medrano was the Lord of Learza and Iguzquiza, ricohombre of Navarre.He rebuilt the castle of Veláz de Medrano into a fortified palace, which was famous for the splendor of the festivities held by Don Ferran Vélaz de Medrano and his children and grandchildren, which were often attended by the Navarrese Monarchs themselves.\nJaime is the paternal great-grandson of Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano, fourth of the name, lord of Igúzquiza, Arguiñano, Arzoz, Learza, Artazu, Zabal, Orendáin, Alcaide of the castle of Monjardin and Viana, royal chamberlain of King Charles III of Navarre and John II of Aragon and Navarre. Don Juan Velaz de Medrano IV accompanied Don Carlos III to France in the year 1397.\nJaime is the paternal great-great-grandson of Don Alvar Diaz de Medrano y Almoravid, Lord of Iguzquiza, ricohombre of Navarre. In 1380 he was Alcaide of Monjardin Castle, and the following two years he was listed among the Mesnaderos of the king.\nJaime is the paternal great-great-great-grandson of Don Juan Velaz de Medrano y Sanchez and Dona Bona de Almoravid. Don Juan Velaz de Medrano, third of the name, was the alcaide of Viana and Dicastillo.\nJaime is the paternal great-great-great-great-grandson of the noble baron and lord Don Juan Martínez de Medrano y Aibar, lord of Sartaguda, Arroniz, Villatuerta, knight, lieutenant and regent of the Kingdom of Navarre in 1328 in awaiting the arrival of his Queen Joan II and her husband Philip III de Évreux.\n\n\n=== Maternal ancestry ===\n\nJaime Vélaz de Medrano y Echauz was also a descendant of the royal House of Évreux; he was the maternal grandson of the 15th Viscount of Baigorri, Don Carlos de Echauz, from the House of Echauz and Juana Margarita de Beaumont. His maternal grandmother Juana Margarita de Beaumont was the daughter of Carlos de Beaumont, of the House of Beaumont, and Ana de Curton. Juana Margaret de Beaumont was the granddaughter of Prince Louis of Navarre, son of King Philip III of Navarre, of the House of Évreux, which is a minor branch of the Capetian dynasty. \nDespite being linked to the House of Beaumont, Jaime more closely aligned with his relatives in the Agramontese faction. His maternal grandfather, the 15th Viscount of Baigorri, participated in the unstable political situation in Navarre, which evolved into the conflict between the Beaumontes side and the Agramonteses. Due to the marriage of the 15th Viscount of Baigorri to Juana Margarita de Beaumont, sister of the head of the Beaumontese, Louis de Beaumont, 1st Count of Lerin; the House of Echauz supported the Beaumontes side, in favor of the Prince of Viana, Carlos de Trastámara. After the conquest of Upper Navarre, by Ferdinand the Catholic, the viscounts of Baigorri withdrew.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2023, the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Amaiur-Maya was celebrated at an event held in the Parliament of Navarra. During the ceremony, the photobook 'Amaiur 1522-2022' and a facsimile of the 1922 photographic album were unveiled by Juantxo Agirre, the general secretary of the Aranzadi Society of Sciences. Additionally, engineer Iker Ibero presented a 3D recreation of the castle of Maya.\nA folk-rock band of Basque origin known as Lur Barnea published a trilogy called \"Amaiur\" on 13 October 2022 in honor of Jaime and the battle of Amaiur-Maya, written by Aingeru Gorrotxategi.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJAIME VELAZ, EL CAPITÁN DE AMAIUR by Peio J.

He was the 14th (and final) lord of the Asada Domain in Settsu Province. After the Meiji Restoration, he was granted the title of Viscount.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1853, Aoki Shigeyoshi was born as the fifth son of the 11th lord of the domain, after his retirement. At the age of 4, Shigeyoshi became the head of the clan in 1856 after the death of his adoptive father. He died two years later in 1858. In 1868, Shigeyoshi showed support for the new government and was appointed as Minister of the Ministry of the People. In 1869, he became the governor of the Asada Domain and made changes to the domain school. There was also a tenant farmer dispute in the domain's territory. In 1871, he was dismissed from his position as the head of the domain due to the abolition of the domain system. In 1884, Shigetatsu became a viscount but died at the age of 31. His adopted son, Nobumitsu, succeeded him.\n\n\n== Family Genealogy ==\nFather : Aoki Shigetatsu\nMother : Unknown\nAdoptive father : Aoki Kazuhiro\nChildren :\nMatsudaira Nobumichi’s third daughter\nUnknown daughter\nAoki Nobumitsu\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of han\nAbolition of the han system\nAoki clan\nAsada Domain\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miss Grand Balearic Islands (Spanish: Miss Grand Islas Baleares) is a Spanish provincial female beauty pageant, founded by Hugo Micaelo in 2019. The pageant's winners represent Balearic Islands in the Miss Grand Spain national competition.\nSince the first competition in the Miss Grand Spain pageant, Balearic Islands representatives won the main title once; by Mariana Rico in 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Vicente Gonzalez acquired the license for Miss Grand Spain in 2015, he began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name the provincial representatives to compete in the national pageant the following year. In the Balearic Islands, the license was granted to a Mallorca-based designer and event organizer, Hugo Micaelo, who organized the first Miss Grand Balearic Islands in 2019, and Sorina Dolghieru was named the first Miss Grand Balearic Islands electing via the regional pageant.\nThe pageant was halted for two consecutive years from 2021 to 2022 due to lacking licensees. It was revived in 2023 after former Miss La Rioja 2005, Marian Valdemoros, and Lucía Fernández, obtained the license.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, Balearic Islands joined the Miss Grand Spain pageant with appointed representatives, two of whom were the finalists in Miss Grand Spain's provincial competitions, held in Malaga and Sevilla.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Balearic Islands's annual editions since 2019.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Balearic Islands representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "Natalie Renuka Banerji is a Swiss chemist and Professor of Chemistry at the University of Bern. She studies organic and hybrid materials using ultrafast spectroscopies. She was awarded the 2015 Grammaticakis-Neumann Prize.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBanerji was born in Geneva, where she spent her childhood. Her mother was Austrian and her father was Indian. At school Banerji wanted to become a veterinarian, but realised that she was more interested in chemistry. Banerji eventually studied chemistry at the University of Geneva. Her doctoral research investigated photoinduced electron transfer using ultrafast (femto-second) spectroscopy. She was particularly interested in the relative geometries of the donor and acceptor materials used in photovoltaics. She has said that she was influenced by the research of Natalie Stingelin and Ursula Keller. For her postdoctoral research she moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she worked with Alan J. Heeger.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nIn 2011 Banerji started her research group at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. She moved to the University of Fribourg as a Swiss National Science Foundation Professor, where she was awarded a European Research Council Starting Grant. In 2015 she was awarded the 2015 Swiss Chemical Society Grammaticakis-Neumann Prize. Her research uses organic semiconductors to transduce information from biological environments. She makes use of water-soluble conjugated polyelectrolytes dissolved in biological systems to unravel their fundamental properties. To understand these processes Banerji studies the interfaces between polyelectrolytes and biomolecules, how the optical and electronic properties of organic semiconductors is impacted by exposure to aqueous environments and the process of information transduction across interfaces. In 2017 she was appointed a Full Professor at the University of Bern.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nSheshanath Bhosale; Adam L Sisson; Pinaki Talukdar; et al.

        "content": "The Ypiranga Esporte Clube is a Brazilian multi-sports club in the city of Porto Velho, in the state of Rondônia. Its colors are blue and white and the club is considered the oldest clubs in the capital of Rondônia.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded on April 13, 1919, Ypiranga was one of the greatest forces in Rondônia sport, especially in football in its amateur phase, when it won 5 local tournaments. The club was founded some time after the emancipation of Porto Velho, until then part of the state of Amazonas.\nThe first president of the new club was the illustrious Dr. Joaquim Augusto Tanajura, who a year after its foundation began occupying a position that today is equivalent to that of mayor of Porto Velho.\n\n\n=== Graduation from football ===\nThe club officially graduated from the practice of football in 1987, having obtained five recognized titles from the Campeonato Rondoniense. Since then, only indoor sports and swimming have been maintained.\n\n\n=== Patrimony ===\nIn 2018, a new clubhouse was inaugurated, which had a \"pool for adults, children's pool, semi-Olympic pool, tennis court, multi-sports court, sand volleyball court, official football field, walking track, playground, kiosks with barbecue, snack bar, as well as space for events\". The management at the time planned the club's football return, something that ended up not materializing.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Ypiranga vs Ferroviário ===\nFerroviário, Ypiranga's main rival, is Rondônia's biggest football champion and Ypiranga is also one of the main clubs in Porto Velho, which created a great rivalry. The confrontation was called the \"Clássico das Multidões\" and always attracted the city's large public.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n=== State ===\nCampeonato Rondoniense (5): 1945, 1953, 1959, 1964,1984\n\n\n=== Municipal ===\nTaça Paulo Saldanha (1): 1925\nTaça Cidade de Porto Velho (1): 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nCampeonato Rondoniense\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Another place\" or \"the other place\" is a euphemism used in many bicameral parliaments using the Westminster system (including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom) and several rival educational establishments.\n\n\n== Parliaments ==\nA member of one house will not usually refer directly to the other, but refer to it indirectly using the phrase \"another place\" or \"the other place\". So, for example, a member of the Senate of Canada would not mention \"the House of Commons\" but would use the phrase \"the other place\".\nThe tradition does not extend to business conducted outside the house (such as speeches and interviews), and is generally dropped when a debate is directly addressing the nature of the other house, such as in debates on reform of the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nThe reasons for the tradition are unclear, but it has been suggested that it dates back to a period of ill-feeling between the two houses of the UK Parliament. Similarly a member talking of their own house would refer to it as \"this place\".\n\n\n== Rivalries between educational establishments ==\nThe universities of Oxford and Cambridge refer to each other as \"the other place\", as do the pupils of the British public schools Eton and Harrow.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBBC Guide to Parliament",

Owned by Radio Beauséjour, it was founded on March 5, 1867, by Israël Landry. Le Moniteur Acadien is the first Acadian newspaper as well as the first French-language newspaper in the Maritimes, with its first issue being published on July 8, 1867. It had previously been individually owned multiple times, until being sold to Radio Beauséjour in 2023 for CA$1.\n\n\n== History ==\nLe Moniteur Acadien was founded on March 5, 1867, by Israël Landry. Landry had previously lived in Chatham, New Brunswick, where he made the newspaper's initial prospectus document. Afterwards, he moved to Shediac, which had a greater Francophone population. There, Le Moniteur Acadien's first issue was published on July 8, 1867, making it the first newspaper publisher for not only French people in the Maritimes but also for Acadians, whom the newspaper's purpose was to serve.Throughout its lifetime, Le Moniteur Acadien has suffered through two fires and has been temporarily shut down, including once in 1926. Overtime, the newspaper would also expand its readership throughout southeast New Brunswick, including in Moncton, Dieppe, Memramcook and Cap-Pelé. On February 1, 2019, the newspaper was sold to politician Bernard Richard.In January 2023, Le Moniteur Acadien was acquired by non-profit radio company Radio Beauséjour for CA$1. Prior to the acquisition, Jason Ouellette, the previous owner of Le Moniteur Acadien, was hired by Radio Beauséjour as a general manager. After the blocking of news content to Canadian users on Meta Platforms following the Online News Act, the newspaper would begin suffering major digital readership losses, with their average monthly site visits dropping to 2,500, a tenth of the visits it had prior to the blocks.Le Moniteur Acadien is a member of Réseau.Presse, formerly known as Association de la presse francophone (APF), a network of French-Canadian newspaper publishers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of newspapers in Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Fiona McIntosh is an English-born Scottish rugby union player, who currently plays as a lock for Saracens Women in Premiership Women's Rugby, the top-tier competition of women's rugby union in England, and the Scotland national team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nMcIntosh started playing rugby union at the age of seven, firstly in the minis section at Old Alleynians, and later for Kent Divas. As a teenager, she took a three-year hiatus from the sport to concentrate on rowing, before returning to rugby while attending Hartpury College. At the age of 18, McIntosh joined Richmond Women, and made her senior rugby debut in September 2018, in a match against Firwood Waterloo during the 2018–19 Premier 15s season. She continued to build her experience with the first team over the next two years, until the club was omitted from the Premier 15s in 2020, following a restructure of the competition.In 2020, McIntosh signed with fellow top-flight London-based club Saracens. She established herself as a first-choice lock over the course of the 2021–22 Premier 15s campaign, helping the club to its fourth consecutive table-topping finish in the regular season, and then starting in the play-off final, where Saracens were crowned champions after defeating Exeter Chiefs by a score of 43–21.Halfway through the 2023–24 Premiership Women's Rugby season, McIntosh spent time on loan at Edinburgh, having been named by the Scottish Rugby Union as one of the 11 Scotland-qualified players available for selection to compete in the 2023–24 Celtic Challenge.\n\n\n== International career ==\nMcIntosh progressed through the Rugby Football Union youth pathways, being named in England Talent Development Group whilst still a student. She subsequently played for the England U20s during the 2019–20 season.In 2023, McIntosh received her first senior call-up with the Scotland squad, qualifying to represent the nation via ancestry. She was selected as part of the country's 2023 WXV campaign, although she did not feature in any of the matches. The following year, she was retained in the Scotland squad ahead of the 2024 Women's Six Nations Championship. McIntosh made her test debut on 13 April 2024, starting in the second row against the country of her birth, England.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nMcIntosh studied at St George's, University of London between 2018 and 2021, earning a bachelor's degree in biomedical science. She then continued her education at King's College London, from where she graduated in 2023, with a master's degree in global health.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Nettleton's Addition Historic District is a historic residential district in the West Central neighborhood of Spokane, Washington. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2006 because of the concentration of historic homes in one of Spokane's oldest residential neighborhoods and for its significance as an example of community planning and development and in the area of architecture. It is the largest national historic district in the state of Washington.\nLocated on a flat plateau surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Spokane River about a mile-and-a-half northwest of the center of Downtown Spokane, the area's proximity to the city center made it one of the first residential areas developed in Spokane. The neighborhood was platted in 1887 and largely developed by 1911. Architectural styles represented in the district include Queen Anne Revival, shingle style, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Bungalow, American Craftsman, as well as a dozen ranch-style homes which were built after 1937 and are not considered to be contributing properties to the historic district. At the time of its listing on the NRHP in 2006, Nettleton's Addition consisted of 949 properties on 1002 parcels, of which 536 are considered to be historic contributing buildings. Notable architects who worked in the neighborhood include Kirtland Cutter and Karl Malmgren.\nA working and middle-class neighborhood from the time of its development through to the present day, Nettleton's Addition consists primarily of one-to-two story single-family homes built of wood. Nettleton's Addition was laid out in a grid pattern with sidewalks on every street and alleys running east-to-west in the middle of each block. The only disruptions to this pattern come in the northern and southwestern edges of the district where the terrain drops off dramatically to the river and in one block in the northeastern portion of the district where the Holmes Elementary campus takes up the entire block.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nNettleton's Addition is located in the western portion of the West Central neighborhood of Spokane, about a mile-and-a-half northwest of the center of Downtown Spokane. The district is located on a flat plateau at approximately 1,880 feet above sea level. The Spokane River bends around the district to the south, west and north forming a deep gorge which falls off from the plateau more than 200 feet over a distance of less than one city block. The historic district is bounded by Summit Boulevard and Mission Avenue on the north, Chestnut Street on the east, Bridge Avenue on the south, and A Street and Summit Boulevard on the west.\n\nThe neighborhood, like those which surround it, was platted on a grid system with east–west blocks roughly 600 feet long and the north–south blocks varying between 250 and 360 feet. Mid-block alleyways run through the middle of each block east-to-west. Streets in the area are 60 feet wide with sidewalks separated from the road by a planting strip. While surrounded by the river on three sides, the district is mostly inland from the river with the exception of two blocks in the north and one block in the south that overlook the river gorge.\nTo the south, beyond Bridge Avenue, is the Kendall Yards development which was built in the 2010s on the site of a former rail yard. This new development across the street from Nettleton's Addition has sparked fears that gentrification will come to the longtime working-class neighborhood.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city of Spokane was first settled in 1873 and officially incorporated in 1881. What is now Nettleton's Addition became one of the earliest residential areas in the city when it was platted as Nettleton's First Addition and Nettleton's Second Addition in 1887. The area was annexed into the city of Spokane in 1891. The earliest construction in the district began in 1880, but most of the development took place in the years immediately following the turn of the century. As Spokane's population boomed in the first decade of the 20th century, Nettleton's Addition saw high levels of development, with 724 of the 949 buildings still standing in 2006 constructed between 1900 and 1912.\nDespite their proximity to the commercial center of Spokane, being roughly a mile-and-a-half from where the city was initially founded, Nettleton's Addition, West Central and the broader area north of the river from the original settlement were initially considered quite remote. The Spokane Falls and the river's gorge when extends downstream from there made crossing to the north bank difficult. Development was opened up in 1889 when a wooden precursor to the Monroe Street Bridge was built to span the river.\n\nDeveloped as a streetcar suburb by William Nettleton along with his son and nephew, Nettleton's Addition reflected many traits of suburban development of the day. With an influx of workers moving into the rapidly growing city, simple homes were built on pattern book designs to house the growing population. Streetcars connected the neighborhood to the downtown core and the rest of the city, as well as to a destination recreational park on the other side of the addition to help draw visitors and potential residents into the area. The park, located just west of Nettleton's Addition along the Spokane River, was developed in 1892 and 1893 and would eventually become known as Natatorium Park for its indoor swimming pool facility.\nThe early history of development in Nettleton's Addition, and the wider West Central neighborhood as a whole, is inextricably linked to the streetcar lines. The Washington Water Power company was founded in 1889 to manage the city's hydroelectric potential. The company also took over management of the city's streetcar network, which had initially been built by real estate developers. Many of those developers would end up on the board of directors at Washington Water Power, including the developer of the Twickenham Addition to the west of Nettleton's Addition and across the river, the developer of Sherwood Addition immediately to the west of Nettleton's Addition, and the owner of the Pettet Tract immediately to the north of Nettletton's Addition. These developers also sat on the board of a cable railway company which served the area as well. Spokane's streetcars were replaced with busses in 1936, but the tracks remain visible in the road in places around Nettleton's Addition.\n\nAfter the boom years of the first decade of the 20th century, development came to a virtual halt not only in Nettleton's Addition but around the city as a whole. Spokane's population exploded from 36,000 in 1900 to 104,402 in 1910, but would only grow by 35 people between 1910 and 1920. This rapid decline in growth left some lots unoccupied in Nettleton's Addition until growth resumed again after World War II.\nThough the area is mostly residential, it is also home to Doyle's Ice Cream Parlor which has been in business in the neighborhood since 1939. Doyle's is listed as a contributing property to the historic district.\nThe working-class neighborhood fell into decline by the early 1970s, when the rail yards immediately \nsouth of the addition, in what is now the Kendall Yards development, were abandoned. Nettleton's Addition and the wider West Central neighborhood became known as a run-down and crime-infested part of the city. The area became known as \"Felony Flats\" and the moniker stuck even into the 2010s as gentrification spurred by the construction of Kendall Yards began to encroach into the rest of West Central including Nettleton's Addition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWest Central, Spokane\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Spokane County, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Belarusian mercenaries in Côte d'Ivoire are a group of former career pilots and technicians of the Armed Forces of Belarus. They were sent under the alleged patronage of the French and Belarusian authorities to assist the government army of Laurent Gbagbo in the First Ivorian Civil War.\nBelarusians were engaged in retraining African pilots who had previously flown the French Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet to operate Soviet Su-25 attack aircraft. The Ivorians made only three sorties with their foreign instructors. During the latter, they attacked the French base in Bouake. The incident led to the capture of the Yamoussoukro airfield by French troops and the performances of the Young Patriots militia in Abidjan.\nAfter that, the Belarusians immediately left the country. Years later, a criminal case was opened against them on the fact of the murder of servicemen. One of the mercenaries, Yuri Sushkin, was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia.At that time, in addition to citizens of Belarus, there were also hired aviation specialists from France, South Africa, Russia and Ukraine in Ivory Coast.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nStijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans.

He was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 2024.\n\n\n== Early life and medical career ==\nLu's mother is of Paiwan descent, while his father is of Rukai ancestry. In the Rukai language, Lu is known by the name Sasuyu Ruljuwan. He was raised in Majia, Pingtung.\nAfter graduating from Kaohsiung Medical College, Lu practiced medicine for nearly three decades in his native Pingtung County, including at the Ministry of Health and Welfare Pingtung Hospital.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn July 2023, Lu was nominated by the Kuomintang as a candidate for the 2024 legislative election representing the multi-member Highland Aborigine Constituency. He finished ahead of incumbent legislator Kung Wen-chi in the election, and took office as a member of the 11th Legislative Yuan on 1 February 2024. In April 2024, the Democratic Progressive Party accused the Kuomintang of rigging a legislative vote on pension reform, as Lu had not signed in, but had a vote registered in his name during the first round, then abstained from the following two rounds. Lu later confirmed that, at the time of all three votes, he was visiting China.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Regardless (Chinese: 不顧一切; pinyin: Bùgù yīqiè) is the seventh studio album by Taiwanese singer A-Mei. It was released on December 5, 2000, through Forward Music, and was ultimately her final studio album to be released under the label. After a year and a half since her last album Can I Hug You, Lover?, Forward Music created a $10 million alliance of musicians from Taipei, Singapore and Los Angeles to create the album Regardless. The album had the longest pre-production period, the longest production period, the largest amount of money spent, and the largest number of people involved in the production out of any of A-Mei's studio albums to that point. All 10 songs were by well-known music connoisseurs from Greater China, which include David Tao, Huang Yi, David Huang, Sky Wu and Yuan Wei-jen.\nThe album came only seven months after her banishment from mainland China due to her singing the National Anthem of the Republic of China at the presidential inauguration ceremony of Chen Shui-bian. Commercially, Regardless was a success. The album sold more than 360,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 1 million copies in Asia. Regardless is listed as one of the best-selling albums in Taiwan in the 21st century.\n\n\n== Background and production ==\n\nOn May 20, 2000, A-Mei sang the National Anthem of the Republic of China at the presidential inauguration ceremony of Chen Shui-bian. The performance infuriated the government of the People's Republic of China, who subsequently barred A-Mei from visiting the mainland. Consequently, all of A-Mei's concerts were cancelled in China out of the blue, along with her lucrative advertising contracts. Under pressure from the Chinese government, Sprite also buckled and cut its contract with A-Mei by dropping her as its spokesperson. Meanwhile, top 40 radio stations in China temporarily ceased playing her music and her commercials were pulled from broadcasting. It was also around this time that rumors began to swirl about A-Mei not renewing her contract with her parent company Forward Music. \nAfter the pressure cooker situation, A-Mei dropped out of sight for several months, living in New York and Los Angeles. In order to present the different sensations in the songs, the recording sessions for Regardless were conducted not only in Taipei, but also in Singapore and Los Angeles, where top musicians from all over the world worked slowly and carefully to produce the 10 songs on the album.\n\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\"One Night Stand\" is a sultry R&B-soul ballad written by David Tao. \"Cinderella\" was written by Cheng Hua Jiuan and Goh Kheng Long; the song is a mellow pop ballad interpreting fairy tale-like delicate love. The album's title track is an arena rock song written by her late mentor Chang Yu-sheng. \"Love Breaks Everyone's Heart\" is a guitar-driven ballad written by Chia-Li Chen and composed by David Huang. \"Wonder Why\" is a trip hop song written by Ye Hanhui and David Tao.\n\"Before It's Too Late\" is a synthesizer heavy ballad written by Shiyi Lang and composed by Phil Chang. \"I Am Amazed\" is a dance song with R&B and pop influences written by Chia-Li Chen and composed by Adam Hsu. \"Racing\" is a dance rock song written by Chien Yao and composed by Sky Wu. \"Last Time\" is mellow pop ballad with guitars and strings written by Yuan Wei-jen. \"The Other Way\" is an upbeat song written by David Tao.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album's standard edition comes in a CD with 10 songs packaged in a slipcase; as well as CD, VCD and a promo. The following year, in 2001, Forward Music released a limited edition reissue of the album. In order to promote Regardless, A-Mei held a series of press conferences in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Live performances ===\nOn the day of the album's release, a concert was held at Nangang District, Taipei. Before the concert began, A-Mei also hosted a cross-country satellite press conference, with Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia all linked to the press conference, along with Taiwan. On December 31, 2000, she participated in a New Year's Eve concert in Taipei. Since then, A-Mei has been performing songs from the album at various events and concert tours.\n\n\n=== Singles and music videos ===\nThe music video for \"One Night Stand\" was directed by Kuang Sheng; the video was filmed on a rooftop and by a seashore. The video for \"Cinderella\" was directed by Jinhe Lin; it depicts A-Mei dawdling around an infinity pool while reminiscing about her lover. The music videos for \"Regardless\" and \"Love Breaks Everyone's Heart\" were directed by Kuang Sheng. The video for \"Before It's Too Late\" was directed by Jinhe Lin.\nIn January 2002, the track \"One Night Stand\" was listed at number 77 on the 2001 Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nThe album Regardless earned A-Mei a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer at the 12th Golden Melody Awards.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Taken into U. S. Navy service during the Quasi War. She was deployed to the Caribbean Sea. Sometime in early 1799 she and  USS Eagle captured French ship Reynard. She returned to Wilmington, North Carolina from the Caribbean on/about April 15, 1799. In a letter dated 20 May 1799 Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert notified the Treasury Secretary that he should consider her to be officially transferred back to the U.S.R.C. Service. A letter on June 4 from Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert notified the Treasury Secretary, Capt. John Brown and the Collector of Customs at Wilmington, North Carolina that control of her was released. At the time she was at Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n\n== Commanding officers ==\nJohn Brown 1798 to at least 1799\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 13 April 2024, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian military, in collaboration with the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, Lebanese group Hezbollah, and the Yemeni Houthis, launched attacks against Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights with drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. The attack was codenamed Operation True Promise (Persian: وعده صادق, romanized: va'de-ye sādeq). Iran said it was retaliation for the Israeli bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April, which killed two Iranian generals. The strike was seen as a spillover of the Israel–Hamas war and marked Iran's first direct attack on Israel since the start of their proxy conflict.\nSeveral countries in the Middle East preemptively closed their airspace a few hours prior to Iran launching a standoff attack against Israel around midnight on 13 April. Iran's attack involved around 170 drones, over 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles directed against Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. A coalition of several countries operated in defense of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces used Arrow 3 and David's Sling systems to shoot down the incoming weapons with help from the American, British, French, and Jordanian air forces. France, which intervened at the request of Jordan, deployed its navy to provide radar coverage. Jordan stated that it had intercepted objects flying into its airspace to ensure its citizens' safety.\nIsrael stated that 99 percent of the drones and missiles were destroyed by the coalition as part of the defense codenamed Iron Shield, most before entering Israeli airspace. A US official said that at least nine Iranian missiles had struck two Israeli airbases, causing minor damage. Some of the ballistic missiles were shot down in space by the Arrow system. The missiles caused minor damage to the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, which remained operational. In Israel, a 7-year-old Israeli Bedouin girl was struck and injured by part of a missile, and thirty-one other people either suffered minor injuries while rushing to shelters or were treated for anxiety. Jordan reported some shrapnel falling on its territory, causing no significant damage or injuries. The next day, Iran's envoy to the United Nations stated that the attacks \"can be deemed concluded\".\nThe attack was the largest attempted drone strike in history, intended to overwhelm anti-aircraft defenses. It was the first time since Iraq's 1991 missile strikes that Israel was directly attacked by the military of another state. Iran's attacks drew criticism from the United Nations, several world leaders, and political analysts, who warned that they risk escalating into a full-blown regional war. Israel retaliated by executing very limited strikes on Iran on 18 April 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince 2010, Iran (and others) have accused Israel of killing Iranian nuclear scientists inside Iran. In 2018, Israeli spies raided an Iranian military facility in Tehran. In February 2022 Israel is accused of having assassinating an Iranian commander in Tehran. Iran also accused Israel of attacking a military facility in Isfahan in January 2023. \n\nOn 1 April 2024, the Iranian consulate annex building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, was struck by an Israeli airstrike, killing 16 people, including a woman and her son, and Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior Quds Force commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and seven other IRGC officers, in addition to six other militants belonging to Hezbollah and other Iran-linked militias. Soon after the attack, Iran vowed to retaliate, with reports suggesting this as a potential motive for the airstrike. The Jerusalem Post reported the building was inside the Iranian diplomatic compound, adjacent to the main embassy building. Numerous countries and international organizations condemned the attack; the United States denied involvement or prior knowledge, though Russia's representative in the UN has questioned this claim, calling it \"surprising\", noting that the US \"always possesses information on any topic firsthand thanks to its intelligence capabilities\".\nIn the weeks following the attack on the consulate, the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom all warned Iran not to attack Israel and escalate the situation. Iran was warned by Israel that such an attack could lead to a direct Israeli military response on Iranian soil. In early April 2024, Iran sent a message via the Swiss embassy (United States Interests Section in Iran) to the United States, threatening to attack the United States' military bases in the region in case of their support of Israel in a possible Iranian attack on Israel. According to Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran gave the regional countries hosting US military bases 72 hours' notice of the imminent attack, but the parties involved varied in their description of the timing and detail of the warning from Iran. Iran held off on attacking for 12 days and messaged via diplomatic channels that it is not interested in waging a full-scale war.\n\n\n=== Israeli-Palestinian conflict ===\n\nIsrael has occupied the Palestinian territories since 1967. Since 1979, the Iranian government has actively supported the Palestinian people. On 7 October 2023, Hamas carried out an attack in southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,139 people and the kidnapping of at least 253 other Israeli and international citizens. Though Hamas has been supported by Iran in the past, US intelligence officials believe that Iran did not have any  involvement in the October 7 attacks. Israel responded by launching the ongoing Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, has resulted in the deaths of more than 33,000 people so far.\n\n\n=== Lebanese border ===\nIn 1982, Israeli invaded Lebanon; soon after Iran helped create Hezbollah to resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon that lasted till 2000. Hezbollah has long pledged solidarity with the Palestinians. As Israel began bombing the Gaza Strip in October 2023, Hezbollah retaliated by attacking northern Israel. There have been over 4,400 violent incidents recorded between Hezbollah and Israel since the start of the war, and about 100,000 Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel since the beginning of the conflict. The Iranian-backed Houthi movement has launched dozens of drones and ballistic missiles towards Israel, and have hijacked and attacked ships in the Red Sea, severely restricting the flow of trade through the Suez Canal.\n\n\n== Attack ==\n\n\n=== Launching of missiles and drones ===\n\nOn the evening of 13 April 2024, Iran launched a drone and missile attack on Israel, targeting—among other unconfirmed trajectories—sites in the Golan Heights and Arad region and two airbases in the Negev desert. The attack was named Operation True Promise (Persian: وعده صادق, romanized: va'de-ye sādeq), with the code name Ya Rasul Allah (یارسول‌الله(ص)). It comprised more than 200 missiles and drones according to The Washington Post and included ballistic missiles according to Iranian news agency IRNA. Both CNN and Reuters later reported that more than 300 standoff weapons had been launched toward Israel. An Israeli military spokesman specified that Iran had launched 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles. According to IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari, approximately 350 rockets were launched at Israel from Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, also noting that the attack consisted of 60 tons of explosive materials.\nAccording to the Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, the primary targets included the Nevatim Airbase from which Israel launched the attack on the Iranian consulate, as well as the intelligence center in the Israeli-occupied part of Mount Hermon that supplied the intelligence. The operation was limited to a retaliatory attack for the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate. Other targets included the Ramon Airbase in the south of Israel, Tel Aviv, and Dimona, which is home to a nuclear facility. According to IRGC's Tasnim News Agency, the tactic used consisted of saturating the Iron Dome and David's Sling with a first wave of hundreds of HESA Shahed 136 kamikaze drones to clear the way for dozens of cruise and ballistic missiles in the second wave. A total of 185 of the newer and faster-flying, jet-propelled Shahed 238 drones were also used.\nHezbollah said it launched dozens of Grad rockets at an Israeli air defense site in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The group said the attack took place shortly after midnight local time.\nTo prepare for the attack, Israel, alongside Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Kuwait, closed their airspace on 13 April; Iran only closed its airspace to VFR flights, and Egypt put its air defense on high alert.\nAccording to Or Fialkov, an Israeli military researcher, some of the missile types used by Iran were the Emad with a warhead of 750 kg, Ghadr-110 with a warhead of between 650 kg and 1000 kg, Kheibar Shekan with a 500 kg warhead, and probably Shahab-3B with a warhead of 700 kg.\n\n\n=== Israel's defensive operation ===\n\nIsrael used the high-altitude Arrow 3 and the medium-range David's Sling systems to shoot down the incoming weapons, and jammed electronic guidance systems to disrupt missile navigation. IDF conducted the defense under the codename Iron Shield. Many drones were downed while flying over Syria. Israel said that 99% of the weapons were successfully intercepted, and that its air force intercepted 25 cruise missiles outside the country, likely over Jordan. \nAt approximately 2:00 a.m. local time on 14 April, explosions were heard in Jerusalem, while air raid sirens sounded across Israel, the West Bank, and the Dead Sea. It is not known whether the explosions were interceptions by the short-range Iron Dome system or were missile strikes. Iranian missiles above the Al-Aqsa Mosque were intercepted.\nIDF jets struck military targets in southern Lebanon belonging to Hezbollah's Radwan forces.\n\n\n=== Defense provided by other countries ===\nThe United States coordinated the multinational defense of Israel, from northern Iraq to the southern Persian Gulf, from the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The US, the United Kingdom, France and Jordan used their own forces to intercept Iranian projectiles, and France also deployed its Navy to provide radar coverage. An anonymous source from the Saudi royal family said that Saudi Arabia had automatically intercepted \"any suspicious entity\" violating its airspace. According to The Wall Street Journal, Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shared intelligence, which included radar tracking information, with the US and Israel prior to Iran's drone attack.\nAmerican aircraft reportedly destroyed more than 80 Iranian weapons—more than half of those threatening Israel—before they reached their targets. The US did not announce where its aircraft launched from; whether any were based in Saudi Arabia is unclear. The head of United States Central Command (CENTCOM) went to Israel on 11 April, to coordinate air defenses. CENTCOM reported late the following day that US forces destroyed more than 80 one-way attack drones and at least 6 ballistic missiles. The US Navy warships involved were reported to be USS Carney (DDG-64) and USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) (both based in the Mediterranean), according to CENTCOM, which also reported that US aircraft from land and sea bases participated. The ships' use of the SM-3 missile was the weapon's first time in combat. A US Army Patriot missile battery in Erbil, Iraq, shot down at least one ballistic missile.\nRoyal Air Force Typhoon fighter aircraft shot down an unspecified number of Iranian drones, as confirmed by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The aircraft were deployed from RAF Akrotiri in the island of Cyprus as well as Romania and were supported by tanker aircraft. The United Kingdom also provided intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support.\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous French officials, reported that France deployed naval assets to assist Israel. President Emmanuel Macron later stated that France had joined in intercepting Iranian drones at Jordan's request.\nJordan lies between Iran and Israel and had readied its air defenses to intercept drones and missiles that violated its airspace.\nIran had warned Jordan against any possible action in support of Israel, but Jordan opened its airspace for US and Israeli war planes nonetheless. Residents in the capital Amman reported seeing flashes in the sky above the city. In the city's Marj al Hamam area residents gathered around the remnants of a large drone that had been intercepted. Haaretz reported that the Royal Jordanian Air Force had downed 20% of the drones launched from Iran. Jordan stated that its military action was an act of self-defense in an effort to safeguard the nation's airspace, territory, and citizens. There was also criticism towards Jordan's intervention that characterized it as having protected Israel.\n\n\n=== Casualties and damage ===\nIran claimed that the saturation tactic using drones managed to defeat the Israeli air defense and damage the bases used in the attack on the Iranian consulate. Iran claimed that significant damage was inflicted on both airbases and an intelligence base in the Golan Heights. Tasnim published videos of targets being hit. However, several images published by Iranian state media showing damage in Israel were later found to be footage of wildfires in Chile instead.\nA senior US official stated that five Iranian ballistic missiles struck the Nevatim Airbase, causing damage to a C-130 transport aircraft, an unused runway, and empty storage facilities. Additionally, four other ballistic missiles impacted the Ramon Airbase. The overall damage caused in the attack was minimal.\nThere were no deaths but a number of injuries from the strikes were reported. A 7-year-old Bedouin girl, Amina Hassouna, was seriously injured by shrapnel from an interception in the Arad area. At least 31 others were treated, either for minor injuries sustained from shrapnel while going to protected areas, or for anxiety.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nHours after the beginning of the attacks, Iran's envoy to the United Nations stated that the retaliatory attack \"can be deemed concluded\", and that Iran will respond with \"stronger and more resolute\" actions if Israel were to \"make another mistake\". It also urged the US to stay away from the Iran–Israel conflict. President Ebrahim Raisi said that Iran had taught a \"lesson\" to Israel through the attack as the Supreme Leader promised. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the attack \"more successful than expected\" and threatened retaliation for any Israeli counterattack. The IRGC also threatened to prosecute those expressing support for Israel online. The Iranian government opened criminal investigations into several news outlets for their coverage of the strikes.\nIraq, Jordan, and Israel reopened their airspace soon after the attacks were over. At least two flights from Wizz Air and Royal Jordanian were diverted to Cyprus with over 700 passengers on board. The Cyprus Air Command alongside the two main airports on Cyprus were also placed on high alert as a result of the attack.\nThe effective interception has led to an increase in the stock prices of Israeli defense firms, such as Elbit Systems, Aerodrome Group, NextVision, and Aryt Industries.\nFollowing the attacks, the Iranian economy experienced immediate adverse effects, with the national currency, the rial, plummeting to a new low against the dollar.\n\n\n=== Israeli retaliatory strikes ===\n\nIsrael vowed to retaliate against Iran. According to Israeli sources, Israel planned to initiate its first steps in a ground offensive in Rafah during the week, but postponed it to consider their response to the Iranian strikes on Israel. The Israeli war cabinet met on 15 April to consider a response to the attack. On 17 April, Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel will \"make our own decisions\" on how to retaliate against Iran. \nOn 18 April, Israel launched a series of retaliatory missile strikes on Iranian military sites. Reports indicate one of these attacks has occurred at a site near Isfahan. Iranian officials have also reported explosions at military sites in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe Economist wrote that \"the strike was militarily a flop\", adding that Iran \"may have miscalculated\". The Jerusalem Post noted that the Iranian attack demonstrated that the events of 7 October did not undermine the Israel–Sunni regional alliance. According to H. A. Hellyer, a Middle East expert, the aim of the attack was not to harm Israel \"with that level of warning\".\nAccording to CNN, the attack by Iran was \"planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle\", and noted that Iranian drones and missiles went past Jordan and Iraq, both with US military bases, and all the air defenses before penetrating the airspace of Israel. The Intercept reported that, according to American military sources, half of the Iranian weapons failed at launch or during flight.\nDov Zakheim, a former undersecretary of defense in the George W. Bush administration, stated that \"Iran is an existential threat in a way the Palestinian issue is not\", thus bringing to the fore American deterrence vis-à-vis Iran. John Bolton, however, called the attacks \"a massive failure of Israeli and American deterrence\" and described Biden's disapproval of a possible counterattack as an embarrassment. Al Jazeera opined that Iran, in no longer relying solely on its proxies, by launching its first attack on Israel from its own soil, its largest missile attack ever, and the largest drone strike in military history, has increased both its deterrence and its soft power in the wider Muslim world. The Guardian stated that some analysts believed that Iran's attack had shattered Israeli deterrence policy.\nThe Wall Street Journal attributed Israel's success to a combination of its \"sophisticated air-defense system and critical assistance provided by the US and other Western and Arab partners,\" whilst The Times diplomatic editor Roger Boyes suggested that the attack \"showed that Israel has only a limited self-sufficiency in security matters. It was dependent on US intelligence for the timing of the assault, for the location of many of the firing positions and on US, British and French assistance to help shoot down the incoming munitions\". According to The Times of Israel, Israel's capability of taking direct and comprehensive strategic action solely on its own initiative was henceforth constrained, and furthermore the calculus of deterrence throughout the region has been changed. The more liberal Haaretz regarded America's assistance as, remarkably, its \"most significant show of support in the history of Israeli-U.S. relations\".\nAn operational analysis by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concluded that the attack was likely intended to cause significant damage below the threshold that would trigger a massive Israeli response. The think tank also noted that the \"attack package\" followed the Russian doctrine used in air strikes against Ukraine during the Russian invasion, albeit on a much larger scale and in a single mission. ISW predicted that the lessons that Iran will learn from this attack will allow it to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of Israel's air defense system and build more successful attack packages in the future, and possibly share these experiences with Russia as well.\nAccording to Reuters, analysts estimate that the cost for Israel and its allies to defend the attack was about $1 billion, while the cost to Iran for the attack was about $80 million to $100 million. The current cost of Israel's short-range Iron Dome, medium-range David's Sling, and high-altitude Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems to intercept airborne threats is in the range of tens of thousands to millions of dollars, but future laser-based systems may substantially decrease the cost of each interception.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian declared that Iran does not welcome escalation, and the purpose of the Iranian operation was the exercise of the legitimate right of Iran for self-defense. The Iranian government declared its reprisal against Israel a success and concluded. Major General Ahmad Haghtalab, the IRGC commander in charge of protecting the security of nuclear sites in Iran said they could change their nuclear doctrine if their nuclear facilities were threatened by Israel.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF halted the attack impressively. Gallant stated that the attack was successfully repelled with the assistance of the United States and other countries. He emphasized the opportunity to form a strategic alliance to counter the serious and possibly nuclear threat posed by Iran. Israel vowed \"a significant response\" to Iran's retaliation.\nHamas said that the Iranian military operation against Israel was a \"natural right and a deserved response\" to the Israeli bombing of the Iranian consulate in Damascus and assassination of IRGC leaders there. The Houthis said that the attacks were a legitimate response to the strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus.\nOn 14 April, Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh stated during a cabinet meeting that any regional escalation would lead to \"dangerous paths\", adding that all parties involved need to de-escalate. On the same day, the country's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi stated that Jordan would take \"all necessary measures\" to protect its sovereignty and security and that it will tackle threats facing its citizens. Safadi stated that Jordan had summoned Iran's ambassador to protest \"offensive statements\" made in Iranian media, particularly about threats against Jordan being the next target if it joined in on the interceptions, calling it an interference in the country's internal affairs. Safadi also added that Jordan would respond in the same way whether the threat came from Israel, Iran or any other country, and noted that the continuation of the Israel–Hamas war and instability in the West Bank would lead to further conflict, calling for a two state solution.

        "content": "Sunset 666 is a live album by Scottish alternative rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain, released on 4 August 2023 by Fuzz Club Records. It contains recordings from two concerts on 11 and 15 December 2018 in Hollywood, California, at the Hollywood Palladium.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSunset 666 was recorded whilst the Jesus and Mary Chain were touring North America in support of Nine Inch Nails between 13 September and 15 December 2018. Tracks 1 to 12 are taken from the 15 December show, and comprises the full set that night, while tracks 13 to 17 are from the 11 December show.\nNo plans had been made to record any shows but as the band's sound engineer discovered a USB-out socket on the rented mixing desk, he plugged in a laptop and recorded the shows. No microphones had been placed to capture audience noise, making the crowd seem distant in the mix. According to the album liner notes, the album contains \"a couple of wrong notes and errors in timing, but these defects were of no great concern because the overall aura was so alive and aggressive.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nJohn Porter, writing for The Spill Magazine, wrote that Sunset 666 \"is undoubtedly the clearest the band have sounded on record.\" He put it down to \"the rawness of the recording, which certainly captures [the songs'] often-incendiary nature, melding together a whirling mass of heavy basslines, crashing drums, and ragged vocals.\" Porter felt that the album's lack of a live show 'feel' – due to the \"stilted crowd noise\" – makes it \"a laborious listen after a while,\" but concluded that the album is \"certainly not a bad record\" and \"an excellent document of the Jesus and Mary Chain as a live band.\"\nJared Dix of Echoes and Dust wrote, \"The results are strong. Keeping things raw and honest, there has been only minimal editing to cut out William tuning his guitar. As the crowd weren't mic'd up their response sounds subdued or distant but despite the pauses between songs the set has a steady momentum.\"\nPost-Trash's Christopher J. Lee noted that the tracks from 1989's Automatic, which faced criticism due to its increased use of drum machines, \"eliminates this factor, with the songs looser and more deeply felt as a result.\" Lee called \"Blues from a Gun\" a highlight from Sunset 666, as did Louder Than War's Nathan Whittle, writing that the band \"hit probably the high of the album with a blistering version of \"Blues from a Gun\". \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain\nJim Reid – vocals\nWilliam Reid – guitar\nScott Von Ryper – guitar, backing vocals\nMark Crozer – bass, backing vocals\nBrian Young – drums, programming\nAdditional personnel\nBernadette Denning – vocals (track 1)\nIsobel Campbell – vocals (tracks 2, 3)\nTechnical\nMichael Brennan – engineering, mixing\nJim Reid – engineering and mixing assistance\nWilliam Reid – engineering and mixing assistance, artwork\nOlya Dyer – design, layout\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blue Diamond Garden Centres (legally incorporated as Blue Diamond UK Limited, and commonly known as Blue Diamond) is a British chain of garden centres based in Eastleigh, Hampshire.\nAs of 2024, it is the largest garden centre group in the UK and the Channel Islands.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlue Diamond Garden Centres began as the Fruit Export Company in 1904, based in Guernsey, with John W. Dorey appointed as manager, and his son Percy as the company's secretary. Percy would later be a part of the States Controlling Committee, a group charged with running Guernsey in conjunction with German forces, during the German occupation of the Channel Islands.\nFollowing the end of the World War II, Percy's son, John Dorey, was appointed as managing director of the Fruit Export Company until his retirement in 1978. John's son, Geoffrey Dorey, started working at the company in 1962, assisting in the sundries store, and fruit collection for export. Following his father's retirement in 1978, Geoffrey became the company's managing director, serving a dual role of managing director and chairman from 1990 to 1998, and continuing to serve as chairman until his retirement in 2015.\nIn 2021, Blue Diamond began a partnership with The Soil Association, a charity spreading awareness of the importance of sustainable food, farming, and forestry. The partnership aims to offer nature-friendly alternatives that reduce the usage of chemical-based products, through the promotion and focus on natural alternatives across different areas of the garden. Examples of the partnership include plant feed, seeds, and bug houses, all approved by The Soil Association.\nIn August 2022, Blue Diamond began a partnership with the National Trust in a five-year collaboration to develop new seeds, bulbs, and plants inspired by the gardens operated by the National Trust. This collaboration also involves designing a show garden for the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in 2024, alongside Ann-Marie Powell Gardens.\nIn November 2022, Blue Diamond acquired the Van Hage group of garden centres. The three centres are the flagship store at Great Amwell, the Van Hage centre in Peterborough, and Chenies located between Amersham and Rickmansworth.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nBlue Diamond currently operates 44 garden centres across the UK and its dependencies. Some of the locations include a range of restaurants and cafes.\n\n\n== References ==",

As a pioneer species, it grows well in new forest areas in semi-shaded areas, but grows slowly. The tree has a yellow edible fruit, and is slow growing. Traditional medicine includes uses of the leaves to treat fevers and ulcers.The tree was first discovered in 1879,  Abh. Königl. Ges. Wiss. Göttingen 24: 151 (1879).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On August 28, 2020, in South Ossetia, the South Ossetian Police reported that a suspect in a murder plot against Igor Naniyev, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Inal Djabiev, had died in custody. After it was revealed that Djabiev was not only innocent, but also brutally tortured to death, massive protests erupted in the capital of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali, demanding reform to not only to the police, but also the entire legal system of the partially recognized Republic.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn August 20, 2020, the South Ossetian police claimed that four residents of Tskhinvali, Inal Djabiev, Zvezdina Maria, Gersan Kulumbegov, and Nikolai Tskhovrebov, stopped their car outside the family home of the South Ossetian Minister of Internal Affairs, Igor Naniyev, and fired two gunshots into Naniyev's car. Naniyev would escape without any harm, and all four would be detained on August 23 and would be taken to a local police station. Under oath, the leader of the investigation against Djabiev stated he was instead arrested on August 27, conflicting with the official reports he approved.\nDjabiev was a vocal political activist in favor of reform, and frequently clashed with the pro-Russian government. Djabiev was also a veteran of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war where he earned a medal for distinguishing himself during the Battle of Tskhinvali. Djabiev had previously been beaten by the police in 2018, in an incident where his jaw was broken and several teeth where knocked out. According to the prosecutor general's office on August 29, the police officers responsible had been planning the incident for some time and \"had a personal dislike for Inal.\"\nAt the station the local police tortured both Djabiev and Kulumbegov, with Djabiev dying in custody, with his death being announced on August 28. Shortly after Kulumbegov would be released with all charges against him dropped. The police would also file a ballistics report which concluded that neither Djabiev nor Kulumbegov was the individual who fired the gunshots.\nOn August 30 Nikolai Tskhovrebov would be released from police custody to the local hospital. At the time of his arrival he was in a coma showing signs of extensive beating. The hospital staff would also leak to the public that Tskhovrebov also showed signs of significant electrocution.\n\n\n== Protests ==\nProtest at least a thousand strong began on August 28 outside the South Ossetian parliament. On August 31 Djabiev's coffin was laid on the steps of parliament prior to his funeral, with protesters demanding the resignation of Anatoly Bibilov. This coffin laying saw a heightened response from the police, with at least one protester, Timur Tskhurbati, a vocal democratic activist, had his nose and cheekbone broken by plainclothes officers due to a post he made to Facebook calling for continued protests.\nStarting on December 4, 2020, Djabiev's widow rallied an anti-police brutality protest outside the South Ossetian general prosecutor's office for over a year, demanding reform to the South Ossetian Police stating that \"people are worried: everyone can be caught and illegally held, and then at the end of the day. How it happened with Inal.\" These protests where met by riot police, resulting in skirmishes with protesters, and quickly grew into one of the substantial protests in South Ossetia since 2011.\nLudwig Chibirov, Leonid Tibilov, and various members of the Parliament of South Ossetia attempted to negotiate with the protestors, promising police reform and a return to the rule of law.  Meanwhile, the South Ossetian opposition joined with the protesters, demanding governmental reform and the resignation of Bibilov and his government. In solidarity with the protestors, the opposition, and some members of the governing coalition, boycotted attending sessions of parliament, bringing the government to a halt with David Sanakoev emerging as a political leader of the protesters. In return Bibilov opened an investigation into \"unprofessionalism and brutal arbitrariness of law enforcement officers.\"\nThe protesters, which ranged from a few hundred to 30–40, remained in the main square of Tskhinvali for their continuous occupation despite that winter's cold snap. Tskhinvali police blocked these protesters from purchasing hot-drinks, cooking with natural gas, or setting up tents, requiring them to camp in the open during the winter. The police's response to a protest against police brutality only reinvigorated the protesters.\nBy December 15 Bibilov offered to meet with Djabiev's family, and pay for their forensic investigation into his death. On December 20, minister of culture Zhanna Zasseeva, and Tskhinvali's ombudsman, Inal Tasoev, were sent to negotiate with the protesters, urging them to return home to prevent the risk of them freezing to death, promising a fair and free investigation into Inal's death, however, his widow rejected this, stating that \"We distrust both MPs and investigators. They offered us to leave the square as they pity us, saying that we'll freeze there. But the dismissal of the Public Prosecutor General was not touched on. But it is he who causes our distrust.\" Shortly after this meeting the protesters set up an impromptu memorial for Djabiev consisting of a portrait, candles and a wreath. The protests would finally end on February 26, 2021.\nOn May 17, 2021, forensic reports on the death of Djabiev where returned. One, by South Ossetian officials, reported that his death was due to acute heart failure caused by a trauma. A parallel Russian team reported that his death was due to acute heart failure caused by drug withdrawals. Djabiev's widow rejected both reports and demanded an independent third report. In June 2021, the South Ossetian investigation team reported that their investigation was not free or fair, and that Bibilov had the investigation be pressured by one of his lackeys, Zarina Dzagoeva, to publish \"knowingly false data\" on Djabiev's death certificate. Shortly afterwards opposition MPs called for the arrest of Dzagoeva.\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nOn September 1, 2020, 17 Members of Parliament boycotted sessions, stating that they would not return to work until Uruzmag Djagaev\nresigned, crippling the government. Djagaev stated that he would not resign until \"select\" members of parliament renounced their parliamentary immunity, so his successor can prosecute them. Shortly after President Anatoly Bibilov sacked his entire cabinet, including Djagaev, and his prime minister, Erik Pukhayev, resigned. Due to the boycott, when the other half of parliament met to form a parliamentary commission to investigate the death, it was unable to proceed, hampering government efforts to investigate who was responsible.\nOn August 13, 2020, South Ossetian Minister of Defense Vladimir Pukhaev was dismissed after it was revealed that a member of the Special Forces extrajudicially beat Azamat Djigkaev, a resident of Tskhinvali, and that the member of the Special Forces was involved in the detaining and torture of Djabiev. Pukhaev was asked to sack the commander of the special forces for the incident, and refused, resulting in both him and his deputy Igor Alborov being dismissed.\nOn January 13, 2021, former presidents Tibilov and Chibirov, as well as former MPs Stanislav Kochiev and Vyacheslav Gobozov as well as chairman of the Central Election Commission Boris Chochiev, signed a document demanding a fair and free investigation, stating it was the only way to resolve the political crisis. The inability for the government to operate had resulted in a failure to pass a budget for the 2021 fiscal year.\nOn May 21, 2021, Bibilov gave a speech to the South Ossetian parliament denouncing the protesters who called for police reform, and reform to the prosecutor generals office, but stated that those responsible for Djabiev's death will be punished in accordance to the law.\nOn July 15, 2022, Djabiev was posthumously acquitted in the Naniyev assassination plot by the Supreme Court of South Ossetia, in reaction Djabiev's widow stated she planned to pursue a civil trial against those responsible, for compensation for their children.\nOn August 9, 2022, Azamat Djigkaev, a resident of Tskhinvali, was beaten by special forces personnel and it was revealed that one of the perpetrators was also involved in the torture of Djabiev and that Djigkaev was targeted for his role in the protests. Djigkaev took part in the continuous occupation outside parliament, and was a high-ranking member of the NGO \"Civic Platform.\"\nBiblov's handling of both the investigation and protests was one of the key reasons he lost the 2022 South Ossetian presidential election to longtime opposition leader Alan Gagloev of the Nykhaz party, which where the most vocal parliamentary voice in favor of the government boycott.\nIn 2024 five members of Bibilov's United Ossetia would defect from the party, citing Bibilov's handling of the investigation and protests, founding the new political party For Justice led by Harry Muldarov.\n\n\n== Trial ==\nOn September 7, 2020, the first arrest against the murderers of Djabiev was made, a Tskhinvali policeman, Atsamaz Naniev, who had a reputation for torturing detainees. Naniev would go on a 8-day hunger strike from May 9, 2021, to May 17, stating that the prosecution has yet to prove his guilt, and that without a trial his own detention was illegal.\nEventually, the South Ossetian government caved to the protesters, and held those they deemed responsible on trial for murder of Djabiev. Namely, Oleg Tekhov, the officer in charge of the interrogation, as well as eight employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs including Igor Naniev, and Prosecutor General Uruzhmag Dzhagaev, who were both sacked from their posts. Tekhov insisted that he had only seen the individuals for 15 minutes as part of their processing, and left the actual interrogations to his underlings, however, the head of the South Ossetian Militsiya, Uruzmag Margiyev, testified that Tekhov not only picked out the room for the torturing, but also personally attended and participated. Margiyev also stated that the torture lasted less than an hour, and that Tekhov personally saw that Djabiev's body was loaded into a car to be taken to a hospital to be pronounced dead, and that Tekhov personally signed the transfer paper to the hospital.\nOn July 7, 2022, the criminal trial, which had been taken to the Tskhinvali City Court, was returned to the prosecutor general's office, stating that the prosecution had illegally obtained materials. Most of the materials proving Djabiev's torture where leaked to the public, and as such could not be used in a South Ossetian court. The trial would remain in limbo for over two years due to the  prosecutor general's office refusing to touch the case, stating that it was \"still in the judiciary\" citing the Tskhinvali City Court's failure to fill out proper paperwork.\nThe court demanded that two victims, Gersan Kulumbegov, and Nikolai Tskhovrebov, should be \"forcefully\" made to attend the trial, however, both where outside the country in North Ossetia and the court determined to hold the trial with them absent. Over the course of the trial seven witness from every branch of law enforcement in South Ossetia, both the regular police, Militsiya, SOBR, and State Security Committee (KGB), all pinned the blame on another agency, stating that when Djabiev was under their custody he had no physical signs of torture, and that the agency they handed him over to must have preformed the torture. As of March 11, 2024, the trial is still ongoing.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

From a young age she was distinguished for her piety, industriousness and kindness. At that time, the fanaticism of the Turks was heightened and that is why parents tried to restore their girls to marriage from a very young age. Thus, Athena also married and had two daughters, Kalliope and Greece.\nDuring the Asia Minor Catastrophe many Greeks of Asia Minor were massacred and those who were rescued left as refugees. The husband of Athena was taken prisoner by the Turks and died in the Task Forces.\nA young widow with two young children and her mother came to Drama with many other compatriots, Asia Minor refugees. He worked in a tobacco shop (as the tobacco factories were called). After a short time, the youngest daughter of Greece died. She found herself in great financial difficulty and supplemented her income by embroidering and sewing.\nDuring the Bulgarian Occupation (1941–44) he was persecuted by the Bulgarians and was forced to move to Thessaloniki for protection. She was staying at the house of Calliope's daughter who had married a few years ago.\nShe was spiritually connected with Saint George of Drama, from whom she became a nun and received the name Anna. In August 1959 he called her to him and announced to her his impending death (November 4, 1959).\nIn the desert place of Sipsa where the saint had monasticized, a brotherhood was established in 1970 led by Abbess Akylina. Thus, with the supervision and support of the Metropolitan of Drama Dionysios, a Holy Monastery dedicated to the Ascension of the Savior was founded and developed in the abandoned area with a large brotherhood of nuns.\nThen Anna left Thessaloniki, where she lived with her daughter's family, and joined the new Brotherhood. He developed all the Christian virtues such as patience and obedience and worked in many manual ministries of the monastery. He had received as a deacon the prayer for those who sought spiritual support from the nuns.\nShe died on January 12, 1981, in the Ascension Monastery of the Savior of Drama.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The leopard skin was a ritual garment in Ancient Egypt. It has been documented with certainty since the Early Dynastic period (around 3000 BC). The mythological roots go back to the pre-dynastic period. In these times, the goddess Mafdet still served as the sky goddess, and her cosmic functions were taken over by the sky goddess Nut in the course of ancient Egyptian history. The Ancient Egyptians therefore used the term \"leopard skin\" in connection with the divine panther. \nDuring his lifetime, the leopard skin identified the king or his designated successor as a divinely legitimized ruler. In the mortuary cult, the leopard skin is mentioned in the pyramid texts as a special symbol of protection and rule for the deceased king in connection with his ascension to heaven after the opening of the mouth ceremony. After successfully ascending to heaven, the sun god Ra accepts him into the divine society. The leopard skin is the king's symbol of power, with which he undertakes his daily journey through the celestial waters alongside the sun god. The leopard skin is therefore one of the symbols that make his immortality visible.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== Use of the term and origin of the name ===\nIn Egyptology, the technical terms panther or leopard skin are commonly used, although the term panther skin is mainly used in German-speaking Egyptology. Some additional references to a possible connection to the similar genet fur are not documented by the written sources with regard to leopard fur. The Egyptians counted the leopard among the family of big cats and the divine desert animals. In this connection, several hieroglyphic representations were possible, for example in the short form as \"The Divine\" or as an ideogram. In the Old Kingdom (2707-2216 BC), the name of a deity of the dead \"Kenmet\" is also translated as \"leopard\", although an equation with the leopard was also only indirectly derived there and is not certain.\n\nIn the Solar Sanctuary of Nyuserre (2455-2420 BC), a larger report is dedicated to the leopard in an appendix in connection with other birthing animals. All species mentioned there are attributed \"divinity\"; they therefore \"need no shepherd\", but are the \"determiners of fate\". An exact attribution to the cheetah or leopard is not possible, as it is only since the Middle Kingdom (2137-1781 BC) that the hieroglyph \nwas no longer used for the word peh (lion or panther). The attribution to the leopard and cheetah could be taken from the Pyramid Texts through parallel mentions, whereby the royal panther skin and the panther skin apron are primarily mentioned. However, the unclear use of the term \"leopard skin/leopard skirt\" is also noticeable here, which does not allow an exact identification of leopard skin or cheetah skin. A reliable attribution is only possible through textual additions, for example the cheetah as abi-mehu (narrow panther) and the leopard as abi-schemau (broad panther).\n\nIn the Middle Kingdom, the original name changed to the new form \"Ba-Abi\", which specifically referred to female leopards. In direct connection with this is the first attested mention of the associated deity Abi in the Middle Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Mythological connections ===\nThe leopard skin was originally a garment worn by people who were very close to the king during the 1st and 2nd dynasties (3032-2707 BC); it was usually worn by the king's son. There is evidence of leopard skins being worn with the name \"Shem\" from the 3rd Dynasty (2707-2639 BC), although the associated priesthood had not yet been developed by this time. There may already be a reference here to the god Sameref as the \"loving son of the king\", who first appeared in mythology around the same time.There is no evidence that non-royal people performed the function of \"Shem\" as leopard skin bearers at this time, so it is likely that the king's son performed the duties of \"Shem\". In the 5th Dynasty (2504-2347 BC), representations on royal temple reliefs of the Old Kingdom show in particular a linking of ancient Egyptian official titles to the leopard skin bearer; for example, the new priestly office of \"Shem\" is mentioned on the sed festival representations of Sahure in connection with the king's son as a leopard skin bearer.\n\n\n== Different representations ==\n\nIn Predynastic times (late 4th millennium B.C.), several types of leopard skin are depicted. Bruce Williams considers it possible that the people depicted on vases from the Naqada IIC period (3800-3300 B.C.) symbolize the wearer of a leopard skin. He therefore identifies the ceremonial activity with a functionary and with that of the tjet depicted in a tomb at Hierakonpolis. However, it remains unclear in this context whether it is the skin of a leopard, cattle or a cattle-like species.\nThe undoubtedly oldest depiction is documented on the head of Scorpion II around 3100 BC. The leopard-skin bearer is among the king's direct escort. He is probably carrying a sheaf of ears of corn and follows a person scattering seeds from a basket into the earth. Further evidence is found on the Narmer palette and the Narmer macehead.\n\nOn many relief depictions, no spots can be recognized for the leopard skin, although it was certainly present in many painted representations. On the few preserved color versions in Ramesside tombs of the kings (1292-1070 BC), the background color of the leopard skin is always yellow. The symbols are applied to the background color in black or white. In the Theban royal tombs, the leopard skin is sometimes also depicted with stars, which refers to the celestial symbolism of the leopard skin.\nThe most frequently used iconographic motifs show a fur robe that covers the entire upper body and a fur cloak that only partially covers it. The fur cloak can be attached to the body in various ways; one possibility is to pull the fur under one arm, while the two front paws are only attached to one shoulder. The other shoulder remains free. The torso, on the other hand, is completely covered by the fur.\nOther variants show a front paw and the panther's head on the shoulders or the crossing of the front paws on the chest, with both paws under the arms. The panther's head is usually placed over the shoulder past the neck, leaving the belly uncovered. The associated hairstyle is a side plait rolled forward, often in combination with a cap-like short hairstyle. Especially in the 18th dynasty (1550-1292 BC), this style was used, for example, by Amenophis I to Thutmosis III, following early traditions.\n\n\n== Historical significance of the leopard skin ==\n\nThe leopard-skin bearer also wore the sidelock of youth, which identified him as the king's son. In iconography, the sidelock of youth also served in the further course of ancient Egyptian history to identify primarily those royal descendants who were eligible as designated heirs to the throne. As part of his priestly function as Tjet or \"Shem\" and as the embodiment of Sameref, the eldest son of the king, who was adorned with the leopard skin, thus acted as a mediator between the king and the world of the gods.\n\n\n=== Early period (3100-2707 BC) ===\nA relief fragment from the area of the former temple of Hathor in Gebelein depicts the leopard skin bearer in the royal cult. The limestone block, which is located in the Museo Egizio  in Turin, is usually dated to the 2nd or early 3rd dynasty. Egyptologists interpret the actions of the leopard skin bearer as a foundation or hunting ritual and as a ceremony within the Sed festival. There is no doubt, however, that it was a symbolic act, as the crown goddess Unut was also involved in the event. The leopard skin bearer was active in the context of the Horus procession, in which the royal exercise of power as the maintenance of kingship was the dominant motif of the ceremonial acts.\n\n\n=== Old Kingdom (2707-2216 BC) ===\nIn royal rituals of the Old Kingdom from the 5th Dynasty onwards, the leopard skin was exclusively the costume of the Shem priest, who was the person among the king's priests who walked directly in front of the king's palanquin in processions. Wolfgang Helck makes it clear that only the eldest son of the king had the royal permission to be close to him. This connection is also shown in the festive scenes of the Pepi II pyramid, which is why it can be assumed that the office of the leopard skin bearer as Shem priest in the associated ceremonies was either occupied by the king's son or symbolically identified him as the acting person.\n\n\n=== Middle Kingdom (2137-1781 BC) ===\nIn the Middle Kingdom, a torso made of granite for Amenemhet III documents the possibility that a designated king could also appear as a leopard skin bearer. Before his sole accession to the throne, Amenemhet III reigned together with his father Sesostris III for around twenty years. Amenemhet III can be seen on the granite block wearing a wispy wig and a strand of pearls in several rows, known as a \"menat\". The leopard skin, which is mainly worn backwards, ends on his shoulders.\nWolfhart Westendorf emphasizes that the iconography of the Middle Kingdom corresponds to the traditional priestly dress of Tjet and shows Amenemhet III in the mythical phase of the divine Horus before he took the place of his father. In addition, Amenemhet III reveals the principle of the young Horus in Chemmis embodied by the deity Iunmutef. The background was formed by the mythological idea that the young Horus stayed in the secret place of Chemmis in order to grow to manhood hidden from Set by Isis, with the leopard skin identifying Amenemhet III as a young Horus and a ritual expert.\n\n\n=== New Kingdom (1550-1070 BC) ===\nThe New Kingdom was characterized by great upheaval. Texts on the dead and coffins were combined to form the Book of the Dead. Life after death and the journey to Sechet-iaru in the Duat was now possible for all those who were financially able to have a personal Book of the Dead written. Accordingly, the leopard skin was part part of the dress of several high priests without being tied to a specific deity; in addition, simple priests of lower rank were also allowed to wear the leopard skin.\n\nHowever, the costume of the leopard skin was still mainly associated with the office of Shem priest. Seti I elevated the figure of Horus Iunmutef, who until then had only been revered as a mystical figure, to the status of the new deity of the dead and had himself appointed as his leopard skin-bearing high priest. Seti I is also depicted in the Temple of Amun in Karnak as the high priest of Amun, who accompanies the royal barque in his role as the son of the god during a procession:\"Amun sees his son carrying him, the king lifting up the one who created him. My hands carry my glorious father (Amun). My body is pure through the leopard skin that is on me.\"\n- Seti IAs in the case of Amenemhet, Ramesses II, the son of Seti I and co-ruling king, also wore the leopard skin at a young age. In the mortuary temple of Seti I in Abydos, the Sameref priests of Ramesses II wore the leopard skin in the sacrificial cult for his father Seti I in front of the royal ancestors. Ramesses II is positioned behind Seti I in the associated depictions and, as the rightful heir, refers to the dynasty of kings who reigned before him, subtitled by name.\n\n\n=== Late period (664-332 BC) ===\nIn the late period, an extended circle of leopard skin bearers was added to the mythological interpretation. In particular, it was now the dress of the queens of the kingdom of Kush. The Kushite king's mothers saw themselves in the role of the goddess Isis, who, as the mother of Horus, was responsible for the royal successors.\nThe queens had a decisive influence in the coronation ritual. Therefore, they assumed the ritual execution of the necessary ceremonial acts in a reinterpretation of Sameref's earlier function as the bearer of the leopard skin. In doing so, they appropriated the content of the Osiris myth and adopted the attributes of the deity Horus-Iunmutef.\n\n\n== The leopard skin in the cult of the dead ==\nAs early as the Old Kingdom, the tomb owner is often depicted wearing a leopard skin cloak on false doors and the entrance areas of burial chambers. This is supplemented by ritual acts in connection with the display of livestock and the provision of offerings. In the cult of the dead, the leopard skin does not represent an earthly office, but shows the ideal rank of the grave owner, which is achieved with the completion of the burial and, as the wearer of the leopard skin, enables him to live on in the sacred land of the deceased with magical powers. In the Middle Kingdom, further functions of the leopard skin are added with the practice of the cult of the dead. It was also part of the standard equipment of those involved in the area of mortuary sacrifices; usually the eldest son or the Shem priests, who were elevated to the rank of sorcerer and thus received the status of \"divinely endowed and recognized spirits of the dead\". Tomb reliefs and stelae show the newly added ritual costume alongside the tomb owner in the traditional role. With the beginning of the New Kingdom, the depictions of the leopard skin predominate on account of its connection to the priestly cult of the dead as the \"loving son\" and \"first of the sacrificial cortege\". In the opening of the mouth ceremony, however, the leopard skin retained its central effect as a cult object of the deceased.\n\n\n=== Unas (2380-2350 BC) ===\n\nUnas was the first king (pharaoh) to have the underground pyramid chambers inscribed with reciting funerary texts in the form of \"death sayings\". With the use of the pyramid texts, Unas established a tradition that ran through the pyramid buildings of the kings and queens of the 6th Dynasty and formed the basis for later funerary liturgies such as coffin texts and the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead. The leopard skin appears in the texts of Unas in direct reference to the cosmic rebirth of the king. The later Book of Nut describes the daily journey of the sun god Ra. The texts of the dead that serve as a basis for this describe the deceased king who, like Ra, travels between the horizons to purify himself at night after sunset in Sechet-iaru in the Merencha, in order to start the day together with Ra again the next morning.\"It (the leopard skin) is perfect for Unas and his Ka. The doors of the starry heavens are opened for this king, that he may pass through them. His leopard skin is on him, his Ames scepter[A 1] is in his arm, his Aba scepter[A 2] is in his hand. This king is unharmed with his flesh, perfect it is for this king with his name, this king lives with his Ka. A sacrifice the king gives that the son may be on thy throne. Let thy garment be the leopard skin, let thy garment be the Chesed skirt, may thou walk in thy sandals.\"\n- Pyramid Texts 224, 225, 338 a-bThe contents of the texts of the dead show that, in addition to the heavenly rule of the deceased king, the leopard skin is also associated with his integrity. This condition was absolutely necessary for heavenly existence, as the absence of the leopard skin had negative effects on the deceased's afterlife. With the sacrificial formula, the king is granted regency over the realms of Horus and Seth, which are located in the eastern heavens.\n\n\n=== Tutankhamun (1332-1323 BC) ===\n\nTutankhamun's tomb is particularly noteworthy because of the leopard skin found in it. A wall painting depicts the opening of the mouth ceremony, in which Tutankhamun's successor Ay himself acts as leopard skin bearer and Shem priest. In addition to the numerous grave goods, two leopard skins were found in the tomb: one made of real leopard skin, decorated with golden stars, with the head made of wood and covered in gold, while the other is a replica made of linen.\nThe same motif can be seen on a group statue in the Louvre, where Tutankhamun is dressed in a star-covered leopard skin cloak and stands between the legs of a statue of Amun, who embraces him from behind. Both arms of the god are resting on Tutankhamun's upper arms. In this depiction, the symbolic father-son relationship is clearly recognizable, in which Tutankhamun appears as the \"loving son\" of his \"father\" Amun. The leopard skin is the visual sign of the family ties between Tutankhamun and Amun. In his role as divine son, Tutankhamun is thus the rightful bearer of the leopard skin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAssmann, Jan (2003).

        "content": "Un autre monde is the fifth album by French singer Daniel Balavoine, released in November 1980. It was commercially successful, selling over 500 thousand copies.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album was released in November 1980 and spawned three singles. The first, \"Mon fils ma bataille\", was hugely successful, going on to sell over 500 thousand copies. The song addresses the topic of divorce, in particular that of a father's struggle to maintain custody of his child. It was inspired by the divorce of guitarist Colin Swinburne's parents, as well as by the film Kramer vs. Kramer released earlier in 1980 that deals with the same subject. The second single, \"Lipstick polychrome\", was released in May 1981 and uses the representation of lipstick in a humorous and metaphorical way saying that lipstick is for everyone, both men and women. The song ends with translations sung in English, Spanish, German, Italian, Tahitian, Polish and Finnish. The final single, \"Je ne suis pas un héros\", was only released in Canada in 1982.\nThe cover of the album depicts a black and white photo of Balavoine holding a camera. In the lens of the camera, there are pictures of Chinese soldiers wearing Maoist hats. The red lettering on the album cover also evokes China, and in the title track there are samples of speeches by Mao Zedong.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDaniel Balavoine – vocals\nRobert Serré – bass guitar, backing vocals\nPatrick Dulphy – guitar\nColin Swinburne – guitar\nJean-Paul Batailley – percussion\nRoger Secco – drums, backing vocals\nJean-Hervé Limeretz – keyboards\nPatrick Bourgoin – brass instruments\nKako Bessot – brass instruments\nTony Brenes – brass instruments\nChristian Guizien – trombone\nGuy Balavoine – backing vocals\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The State of Grandsublime (Turkish: Başyücelik Devleti) is a model for an Islamic federate state that would replace Turkey.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept was created by Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, and it was put forward by Salih Mirzabeyoğlu. The model of the State of Grandsublime is an Islamic state based on Sharia. The State of Grandsublime is not an nation-state nor an ethnocracy, its leader could be from any ethnicity as long as he is Islamically qualified, no ethnicity would have superiority over another, and names such as \"Turkistan\", \"Kurdistan\", or \"Lazistan\" could be used in areas with a Turkish, Kurdish, or Laz majority in the State of Grandsublime, and separatism would be quelled as each ethnicity would be completely equal. Advocates of the State of Grandsublime view Turkey as being against Islam due to it being a nation-state, its nationalistic structure, and its secular foundation, and they aim for the complete dissolution of it and the establishment of the State of Grandsublime. The State of Grandsublime does not recognise Misak-ı Millî nor plan to expand. Qisas would be used State of Grandsublime. The Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front carried out armed activities in order to fulfil the creation of the State of Grandsublime.\nThere would be a \"Grand Congress\" instead of parliament. The congress consists of a council of \"the ones who think and act the best in the nation.\" Each member of the council \"lives in wujud and love.\" The council is formed by a constituent assembly for the first time, and the members of the congress have no limit in their terms. The council consists of 101 people between the ages of 40 and 65. A person from within is elected by the council as the \"Sublime Leader\" (Başyüce). The Sublime Leader is the head of state. Although there would be no limits on the term the head of state can serve, elections would be held every five years to ensure that the head of state is still competent and eligible for leadership. The head of state can be overthrown without elections if seventy-five percent of the members of the congress agree. The head of state cannot directly overthrow the congress, but he can choose forty percent of the members of the congress to keep, and make an election, in which if a decision is made in favor of the leader, new members of congress could be elected by the forty percent. The government would work \"on behalf of the greatest representative to the smallest\", starting with the head of state, who will be the head of the army as well. The direct deputy of the Başyüce would be the Başbuğ, the second most powerful in the country. One of the most important institutions in the State of Grandsublime would be the \"Supreme Religion Department\". The head of the Supreme Religious Department is at the same level as the head of the government and is also elected by the Başyüce. The Supreme Religious Department undertakes duties such as internal suggestion, external propaganda, religious education, training and staffing of religious servants and can be considered as the main consultation center of the state under the command of the Supreme Council and next to the Supreme Congress. There is also a \"People's Court\", which gathers on certain days of the year, and anyone can go to the podium and say their opinions. The People's Court has no power to sanction or participate in the administration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaliphate State\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Karelian Proper (Karelian Proper: Varšinaiskarjala) is a supradialect of the Karelian language, which is a Finnic language. Karelian Proper is one of two/three Karelian dialects, along with Livvi-Karelian and Ludic. Karelian Proper is a direct descendent of the Old Karelian language, compared to Livvi-Karelian and Ludian supradialects which were formed through interactions between the Old Karelian and the Old Veps languages. Karelian Proper is situated in all of White Karelia and Central Karelia (parts of Olonets Karelia).\n\n\n== Dialects ==\nKarelian Proper is divided into two main dialects, which are Northern Karelian and South Karelian. The terms North and South Karelian are often avoided to avoid conflict with the Regions of Finland; North Karelia and South Karelia. Karelian Proper and most of its dialects are mostly mutually intelligible with the Finnish language, however Karelian Proper is not entirely mutually intelligible with Livvi-Karelian.\n\n\n=== White Sea Karelian ===\nWhite Sea Karelian (North Karelian) is the second most spoken dialect of Karelian Proper, spoken in the northernmost parts of the Republic of Karelia and in Kuhmo, Finland. Within the Republic of Karelia it is mainly spoken in Kalevala, Kostomuksha and Loukhi. Within Finland, it is spoken in Suomussalmi. White Sea Karelian is the most mutually intelligible dialect of Karelian Proper to Finnish Language speakers.\nExample:\n\n\n=== South Karelian ===\n\nSouth Karelian is the most spoken of the two dialects of Karelian Proper, and it is spoken in Central Karelia and Tver Oblast. South Karelian is spoken in Tunkua, Suikujärvi, Repola, Rukajärvi, Paatene, Mäntyselkä, Porajärvi, Ilomantsi, Korpiselkä, Suojärvi, Tver Oblast (Likhoslavl), Tihvinä, Valday, Suistamo and Impilahti.\nExample:\n\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n\n=== Vowels ===\n\n\n==== Diphthongs ====\n\n\n==== Triphthongs ====\n\n\n==== Consonants ====\n/b, d, ɡ, z, ʒ/ are consonants found in loanwords in Karelian Proper alongside; /dʲ lʲ nʲ rʲ sʲ tʲ/ (/zʲ/ as palatalized consonants in loanwords only in Karelian Proper. In South Karelian (Tver Karelian), /dʲ lʲ nʲ rʲ sʲ tʲ zʲ/ also exist as palatalized consonants.\n\n\n== Grammatical cases ==\nGrammatical cases of Karelian Proper is extremely similar to the Finnish language and to other related Baltic-Finnic languages. These are the grammatical cases for food:\n\n\n== Alphabet ==\nUntil the 1930s, no Karelian language nor dialect had an official alphabet, and the Cyrillic alphabet was sometimes used until then. From 1930 to 1931 a new alphabet was developed and all Karelian languages adopted the Latin alphabet.  \n\nIn 2007, the current Karelian alphabet was adopted by the Republic of Karelia, making it a uniform script for all Karelian languages. This unified alphabet was approved in 2007 as a replacement to deal with the separate Olonets Karelian and Karelian Proper alphabets. The main difference between the two alphabets is the inclusion of the letter C.\n\n\n=== Letter names and IPA ===\n\n\n== Common phrases ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKarelian Proper open test wiki",

Corellis captured 8 track championships at the Lebanon Valley Speedway NY during his career, including five consecutive titles from 1971 to 1975.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nTommy Corellis started racing at age 14 at Lebanon Valley, but promptly got expelled.  He returned a few years later and became a dominant racer, ultimately winning 83 feature events at the venue.  Corellis also competed regularly at the Albany-Saratoga Speedway NY, Devil's Bowl Speedway VT, and Orange County Fair Speedway NY.  He captured both the 1986 and 1987 Independence Day events at the Syracuse Mile.\nAfter surgery to remove a brain aneurism in 1989, Tommy Corellis made multiple return visits to victory lane before permanently handing the keys to his son Donnie in 1996.  He was inducted into the Northeast Dirt Modified and the New York State Stock Car Association Halls of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "TISZA – Respect and Freedom Party (Hungarian: TISZA – Tisztelet és Szabadság Párt) is a political party in Hungary founded in 2021. Initially a small party, it rapidly gained in prominence when former government member Péter Magyar joined the party, and the members of his non-party movement \"Stand up Hungarians Community\" occupied the majority in its bodies to contest the 2024 European Parliament election.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was founded in 2021 and planned to contest the elections next year in 2022. The party rejected state funds and instead relied on donations and personal wealth of its members. While it collected 222,000 forints, the party could not run in  the elections that year. The party stayed quiet for two years, until in 2024 Péter Magyar announced he'd be contesting the 2024 European elections with the party.\nPéter Magyar, ex-husband of former Minister of Justice Judit Varga, came onto the political scene after the pardoning scandal in which President Katalin Novák pardoned a man who tried to force victims of sexual abuse by an orphanage principal to withdraw their court cases. Varga, as Minister of Justice, also had to sign the pardons and was therefore complicit in the scandal.\nPéter Magyar organised his first protest on March 15, a historic date, the beginning of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution, which was symbolic as its goal was to establish an independent, democratic Hungarian state. Events were also held by both the government and the regular opposition, but his demonstration attracted the largest crowds.\nAfter this, he himself proceeded to cause yet another scandal for the government, as he published a recording relating to the Schadl-Völner corruption case involving two senior officials, György Schadl, the President of the Hungarian Court Bailiffs’ Office, and Pál Völner, a member of parliament, State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Deputy Minister of Justice. In the recording, his ex-wife — the Minister of Justice at the time — admits that documents relating to the trial had been altered at the orders of the government. As he presented this information to the jury, a protest crowd of around one thousand gathered outside, demanding the resignation of the government.\nMagyar had discussed having a political party with him as a leading member contest the 2024 European Parliament election. He, however couldn't found his own party as parties founded past a certain deadline could not register to contest the election. Due to this, he'd have to find a minor party to cooperate with. Eventually, it was announced that Magyar would join TISZA - Respect and Freedom Party.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe party was chosen by Péter Magyar due to their similarities in views. Péter Magyar has spoken numerous times about creating a \"third political force\" in Hungary. The party has also ruled out cooperation with the opposition.\nPéter Magyar had hosted a third protest against the \"mafia state\" and anti-corruption is a key part of most anti-government parties.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robley Rex VA Medical Center is a hospital located in Louisville, Kentucky, and administered by the Veterans Health Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The center is dedicated to the care of veterans of the United States military living in a 32-county service area in Kentucky and Southern Indiana.\nThe hospital first opened in 1952, with a construction cost of $8 million, almost double the original cost projection, and was built on the site of a former city reservoir on a hill above Zorn and Mellwood avenues, near the Ohio River. It replaced the Nichols U.S. Army General Hospital, the largest hospital in Louisville during World War II. Originally known only as the Louisville Veterans Hospital, the hospital was given its current name in 2010 to honor Robley Rex, a World War I-era veteran and VA volunteer. While the hospital originally opened as a full-service hospital with 494 beds, as of 2024 the facility is listed only as a short-term acute care facility with no staffed beds. In 2022, the hospital received Level 1 Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation (GEDA) from the American College of Emergency Physicians, the highest possible rating. Current services offered include primary care, mental health care, specialty care, and social programs and services.\nIn November 2021, ground was broken for a replacement VA hospital in Louisville. The new hospital, located on Brownsboro Road, just off of Interstate 264, is expected to have 104 beds, as well as a women's health clinic, at a projected cost of $840 million. Construction is expected to be complete by early 2026.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 13 April 2024, Iran seized MSC Aries, a Portuguese-registered and Madeira-flagged container ship owned by Gortal Shipping and leased to Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). The ship, with a crew of 25 people, was boarded by Iranian commandos in the Strait of Hormuz, within international waters off the coast of the UAE, and taken to Iranian waters, effectively imprisoning the crew.\nFollowing the incident, Israel called on the European Union to sanction the Iran Armed Forces. The US, UK and Portugal (where the ship is registered) called for the ship's immediate release.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince 2019, Iran has engaged in heightened naval action against European, American and Israeli shipping, persistently attacking various vessels and seizing ships amidst political issues, dubbed \"piracy\" by Israeli outlets in 2023. Both the 1958 Geneva Convention on the High Seas and article 101(1)(a) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) state that piracy occurs on the high seas. Additionally, Article 58(2) of UNCLOS states that piracy can occur in an exclusive economic zone. Violent acts against ships in the territorial sea of any State cannot be piracy under international law. Violent acts in territorial seas are armed robbery under the law of the International Maritime Organization. The event occurred during an escalation between Iran and Israel during the proxy war between Israel and Iran and Hamas. United States president Joe Biden warned Iran not to escalate the situation in the week preceding the incident.\n\n\n== MSC Aries ==\n\nThe MSC Aries is a container ship built in 2020. As of 2024 the ship is Portuguese-registered and Madeira-flagged. She has a length of 366 metres and a beam of 51 metres. It had a gross tonnage of 149,525 tonnes and a summer deadweight of 158,097 tonnes. The ship is leased by MSC from Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime, with MSC directing the ship’s activities.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn the morning of 13th of April 2024, Iran's Revolutionary Guards boarded and took control of MSC Aries via helicopter, claiming that it had violated maritime law. The seizure of the ship occurred in international waters near the UAE coast. The Israeli foreign minister called the Iranian action an act of international piracy, in alignment with international law. The Iranian military subsequently took the ship and its crew to Iranian waters. The 25 crew members onboard comprised 17 Indians, four Filipinos, two Pakistanis, one Russian and one Estonian national.\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nFollowing the incident, the Israeli foreign minister called on the European Union to sanction the IRGC. Joe Biden shortened his vacation and returned to the White House for \"security consultations,\" and defence secretary Lloyd Austin called the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and said Israel can rely on the United States.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Iranian strikes in Israel\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rue Esquermoise is a street in Lille.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\n\nLocated in the Lille-Centre district, it links Place du Général-de-Gaulle with Rue Royale and Rue de la Barre. From Place du Général de Gaulle, Rue Esquermoise crosses, on the left, the rue Saint-Etienne pedestrian street, on the right rue des Débris Saint-Etienne, named after the former church of Saint-Etienne, destroyed during the siege of Lille in 1792, on the left rue des Poissonceaux, named after the former Poissonceaux canal, covered over in 1877, parallel to the street to the south, on the right rue Basse, on the left rue Thiers, on the right rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the former refuge street of Loos Abbey.\nIt continues into Rue de la Barre to the southwest (the start of the old route de Dunkerque) and Rue Royale, one of the main thoroughfares in the district created when Vauban enlarged the town in 1670.\nA passageway opened after 2005 on the first floor of a house facing Rue Thiers allows pedestrians and cyclists to reach the Parvis de la Treille via rue de Weppes, established on the site of the canal of the Pont de Weppes, which was covered over in 1933.\n\n\n== Name origin ==\nIt takes its name from its route, which led to the former commune of Esquermes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRue Esquermoise is one of Lille's oldest streets.\nIt joined the Place du Marché (today's Grand'Place) to the future Route de Dunkerque (today's Rue de la Barre).\nIt ran towards the village of Esquermes (formerly a parish, then annexed by the city of Lille in 1858), from which it took its name.\nBetween today's rue des Poissonceaux and rue Thiers, from the 14th century until its demolition in 1801, stood the façade of the Hôtel de la Poterne, seat of Lille's chambre des Comptes and later finance office.\nUntil the canal de la Baignerie was covered by rue Thiers in 1878 and the canal du Pont de Weppes in 1933, the street crossed this inland waterway via the Pont de Weppes, which was located at the junction with rue Thiers. Houses dating from the 17th and 18th centuries were built on the north side, blocking the view of the canal (now rue de Weppes). The other side of the bridge (towards today's rue Thiers) was undeveloped.\n\nThe Porte de Weppes was located near this bridge (now at the corner of Rue Esquermoise and Rue Thiers) on Lille's second city wall of the 11th century.\nThe end of rue Esquermoise, from the corner with today's rue Thiers to rue de la Barre, was therefore located outside the city until Lille was extended to include rue de la Barre and the faubourg de Weppes, and the ramparts were extended as far as the Porte de Barre. This extension probably dates from the 13th century.\n\n\n== Remarkable buildings and places of remembrance ==\nFive building lots are listed as historic monuments in Lille. The buildings located at nos. 4, 6, 8 and nos. 5, 7, 34 and 36 have had their roofs and street facades listed as historic monuments since March 13, 1944.\nNo. 5 also has the first building's sign depicting the hen inscribed. No. 15 has the carved stone Maisoncelle sign embedded in the façade, listed since March 15, 1944.\nMaison Méert, located at no. 27, has been listed as a historic monument since August 5, 1980. The front of the patisserie, founded in 1761, was designed by Lille architect Charles Benvignat and dates from 1839.\n\nThe Ravet-Anceau directories had their headquarters at no. 52.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLille\nList of twin towns and sister cities in France\nPlace du Général-de-Gaulle (Lille)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nOld photographs of the street on the Lille municipal library website",

        "content": "Rainer Schultze-Kraft (* 8 November 1941 in Freiburg im Breisgau † 16 February 2024 in Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German agricultural scientist. He was particularly committed to the preservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of forage plants in the tropics and subtropics.\n\n\n== Education and professional life ==\nAfter graduating from high school in Heidelberg in 1960, Schultze-Kraft worked for six years on the Hacienda Buritaca near Santa Marta in Colombia. From 1967 to 1972 he studied Agricultural Science with specialization in tropical agriculture at Justus Liebig University Giessen. He received his doctorate (PhD) at the same university in 1976 with a topic on the suitability of species and ecotypes of the legume genus Stylosanthes (Dalbergieae) for pasture improvement in tropical savannas of South America, by the example of the Colombian Llanos Orientales, supervised by the German plant scientist Jochen Alkämper. During his doctoral research, from 1973 onwards, he worked at the international agricultural research institute International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Palmira, Colombia, first as a Visiting Research Associate, guided by the Australian agronomist Bela \"Bert\" Grof. From 1976, he headed the Forage Germplasm Section of CIAT's Tropical Pastures Program as a senior scientist.\nFrom 1991 to 2007, Schultze-Kraft was a full professor for grassland and pasture sciences] in the tropics and subtropics at the Institute for Plant Production and Agroecology in the Tropics and Subtropics at University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart.\nAfter retiring in 2007, he lived alternately in Ginebra, Valle del Cauca, Colombia and the Black Forest. He was married to the Colombian María Cecilia Tascón, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Rainer Schultze-Kraft was the younger brother of the translator and editor of Latin American literature Peter Schultze-Kraft (*1937).\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nSchultze-Kraft's main scientific interest was the identification of forage legumes that were digestible by and acceptable to livestock, adapted to typical, very acidic soils of the tropics and subtropics. Since there was a lack of such plant species in international and national genebanks, Schultze-Kraft undertook almost 40 collecting trips to South and Central America, Mexico, Southeast Asia and Africa, where he collected seeds of potential forage plants together with local scientists. He was particularly interested in the legume genera Stylosanthes, Desmodium and Centrosema, and later also in forage shrubs of species in the genera Cratylia and Flemingia as well as Desmodium and Desmodium-related species. After their introduction to Colombia, the collected accessions underwent a standard characterization and evaluation scheme. Most of the over 20,000 accessions collected by Schultze-Kraft are still stored in CIAT's genebank. During the evaluation of large collections of potential forage legumes, previously botanically undescribed plant types or even new plant species were often discovered, which Schultze-Kraft published in collaboration with various plant systematics specialists. Even after retirement, he continued to work on this.\nRainer Schultze-Kraft also distinguished himself by \n\nThe re-foundation of the scientific journal Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales (open-access online), first published by CIAT and now by the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), also as editor in chief together with his Australian colleague Lyle Winks.\nDescription of several new plant species in the genera Centrosema and Stylosanthes, as well as taxonomic revisions of these genera.\nAbout 300 scientific publications together with colleagues and supervised students.\nTogether with his brother Peter Schultze-Kraft, literary translations from Spanish to German, including some works by Tomás González and Pedro Badrán.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n1997 Fellow of the Tropical Grassland Society of Australia\n2009 CIAT Emeritus Status\n2016 Friendship Award by the Chinese Government \n2022 International Science and Technology Cooperation Award of the Chinese Province Hainan\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn Memoriam: Prof. Dr. Rainer Schultze-Kraft, A Trailblazer in Agricultural Science 18 February 2024\nIn memory of Rainer Schultze-Kraft 20 February 2024 by Luigi Guarino\nTropische Weidewirtschaft und globaler Wandel Internationales Symposium an der Universität Hohenheim aus Anlass der Verabschiedung von Prof. Dr. Rainer Schultze-Kraft, Stuttgart, 16.

        "content": "The Siege of Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Dansborg) or the Siege of Fort Dansborg (Danish; Belejringen af Fort Dansborg), was a siege of the newly finished Danish fort of Dansborg in Trangebar in 1624. The siege was initiated by the nayak of Thanjavur, Raghunatha, because of the Danish rejection of the demands from the nayak. The Siege, laid by general Calicut, was abandoned after the arrival of Danish reinforcements from sea. The event is mostly described by Icelander, Jón Ólafsson, in his work The Life of the Icelander Jón Ólafsson, Traveller to India.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBetween Christian IV of Denmark and Raja of Ceylon (1618)Admiral Ove Gjedde, commander of the Danish East India Company, had in 1620 set out for Asia in the hopes of establishing a colony and monopoly on Ceylon. The Danish ventures on Ceylon proved unsuccessful, yet they managed to conclude a treaty with Raghunatha, Nayak of Thanjavur, on a lease on the fishing village of Tarangambadi (Danish; Trankebar: Portuguese; Tranquebar). Gjedde quickly started the construction on what would become Fort Dansborg. Dansborg would be build in classic Danish style, and would be the second largest Danish fort after Kronborg. Ove Gjedde would leave for Copenhagen on 13 February 1621, yet the constructions would continue until Dansborg stood ready in 1624.\nStaying in the colony was, Dutchman Roland Crappé, who was a prominent and experienced seafarer. As consequence of Gjedde's departure, Crappé was announced director and thereby the highest ranked Danish in India. Though, Crappé departed home in 1622, and Tranquebar was left for itself.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nIn October 1623, Nayak Raghunatha send some of his subjects to deliver a message for him at Tranquebar. The couriers were well received by the governorate at Dansborg. In the letter, Raghunatha demanded a considerable amount of lead, which the rector of Dansborg, Henrik Hess, weren't able to fullfil. Irritated at this response, the couriers quickly left and informed Raghunatha about the situation. Raghunatha, equally frustrated as the couriers, now made an ultimatum, that if his desired amount of lead weren't given, he would relinquish the former treaty, giving the Danes Tranquebar. Again, Hess apologized and explained the situation, yet Raghunatha still sendt his Field marshal, Calicut, to Tranquebar with an army. According to traveler, Jón Ólafsson, the Thanjavurian army reached 40.000 men and 1000 camels, horses and elephants, though this may be highly exargerated.\n\n\n== Siege ==\nOn Dansborg, the Thanjavurian threat was imminent, and the fort quickly began preparing for a siege or assault. All cannons were charged, and 800 barrels of water were collected. The governorate called all inhabitants of Tranquebar up to the fort, where they were presented with the choice of joining the preparations or be an outcast, though all joined the defenses. The local Indians, who too guarded the fort, were also represented with a similar choice, yet they also chose to stay. To Danish the demise, the inhabitants got sick and died, and the fort's crew went from 80 to 30 men throughout the winter. Additionally, Dansborg was in worryingly bad conditions for the Danes.\n\nAfter a long march, general Calicut reached the town of Trichlagore, where he would set camp in 14 days.\n\n\n=== Arrival of St. Laurentius ===\nOn Passion Sunday 1624 the Danish vessel, St. Laurentius, arrived from Tenasserim to Tranquebar, with Captain Christopher Hansen Boye. The crew at Dansborg hoisted the Dannebrog and saluted the ship by cannon shots. When Calicut heard the shots from his camp, approximately one mile away, he ordered his messengers to investigate. When his messengers notified the general about the arrival of St. Laurentius, he ordered his army to march half a mile to Tranquebar, where they would lay the week to Palm Sunday.\n\n\n== Arrival of Perlen and Jupiter ==\n\nBack in Denmark, Roland Crappé was on 25 March 1623 made general and commander of East India, and on 27 March he set sail for Tranquebar on the vessel, Perlen, accompanied by the smaller vessel, Jupiter. On 14 March 1624, they arrived on the coast of Dansborg. They were, too, well-received and Dansborg again hoisted it's flag and saluted the ships. 9 cannon shots were fired in honour of Crappé. When calicut heard the shots, he and 500 men stood outside the fortress gate. He, too, was honoured with 9 cannon shots, after which he was let in.\n\n\n== Negotiations and aftermath ==\nCalicut began negotiations with the governorate, and stated that Henrik Hess was to blame for the hostilities. Though, Crappé showcased Calicut all the fortification's cannons, which all shot in honour for Calicut, in which the two copper cannons on Perlen proudly did the same.\nAccording to Ólafsson, Calicut is said to have asked Crappé, if the ship's cannons were bigger than that of Dansborg's, to which Crappé replied yes. This made a big impact on Calicut, and a peace was subsequently concluded. Afterwards, Roland Crappé and Nayak Raghunatha exchanged expensive gifts. Crappé would go on to rule the company for 12 more years, in which he would expand trade and commerce.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOve Gjedde – Danish nobleman and Admiral of the Realm\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\nWillem Leyel's siege of Dansborg – Siege of Fort Dansborg, 1644\nJón Ólafsson (traveller) – Icelandic author (1593-1679)Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Museo Etrusco Guarnacci (in effect, the Guarnacci Museum of Etruscan Artifacts) is a public archeological museum located on Via Don Giovanni Minzoni #15 in Volterra, region of Tuscany, Italy. This was one of the first public museums in Italy, founded in 1761 by the aristocrat and abbott Mario Guarnacci (1701–1785).\n\n\n== Description ==\nGuarnacci was a zealous collector of antiquities, and donated his collection, including over 600 funerary urns, to “the citizens of the city of Volterra”. The donation also included a rich library of more than 50,000 volumes. Guarnacci himself published a contemporaneously controversial text, Origini Italiche, claiming that Greek and Latin cultures had their origins in an antecedent Etruscan civilization. \nThe first Museum was housed in Palazzo Maffei in Via Guidi, which had been purchased by Guarnacci to house his collection. At his death in 1785 the collection was moved to the 13th century Palazzo dei Priori. With further additions, the museum was transferred in 1877 by then director Niccolo Maffei to the Palazzo Desideri Tangassi.\nThe original displays were organized by theme rather than by chronology; this arrangement still persists for in the displays of for example, cinerary urns. The museum on the ground floor in Room I displays the artifacts from the necropolis of the Badia and the Guerrucia excavated in 1892/1898. Additional findings from the site, discovered in 1996, in a Warriors Tomb including a bronze crested helmet and a laminated bronze flask were added to the exhibit.\nThe second room displays a bucchero Kyathos from Monteriggioni, a series of bronze votive figurines and jewellery from the tomb in Gesseri di Berignone (Volterra) donated to the museum by Bishop Incontri in 1839. The Stele of Avile Tite from the 6th-century B.C. is on display.\nIn Room III, are displayed artifacts from the 5th-century B.C: a scarab in carnelian with a Greek inscription bearing the name of the artist (Lysandros), an Attic Krater attributed to the Berlin Painter, and the Etruscan calque sculpture, the Lorenzini Head.\nIn the second floor are artifacts from tombs of the Hellenistic centuries (6th-1st century B.C.). The urns would hold the cremated ashes of the honored dead, and their lids often represented a recumbent figure attending a banquet feast. In Room 30, are a display of urns made from local alabaster. Further rooms include artifacts in bronze and ceramics; mirrors, votive figurines, vases, locally minted coins, and black and red figure vases. Room 35 displays a statue of the 3rd century Mother and Child (Kourotrophos Maffei) and fragments of terracotta decorations from a temple facade. The museum also displays a collection of mosaic floor and Ancient coins.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1999 GMC World Curling Tour Players' Championship, the championship of the men's World Curling Tour (WCT) for the 1998-99 curling season was held March 17–21, 1999 at the Max Bell Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The total purse for the event was $150,000 with $20,000 going to the winning team, plus $1,000 per win and $250 per loss.\nOntario's Team Wayne Middaugh went undefeated en route to Middaugh's third tour championship title, and second as a skip. The team defeated the Russ Howard rink (also from Ontario, but with Howard living in New Brunswick) in the final, 9–5. The victory was helped by a three-ender in the third after Howard missed both of his draws, giving Middaugh an easy draw to take a 4–2 lead up to that point. In the fifth, Howard attempted to tie the game with a tap-back for two, but his rock hit a guard, resulting in a steal of one for Middaugh, who took a 5–2 lead. Middaugh did not look back from there. With the win, he took home $25,000 for the week, and Howard won $19,250.\nThe event was well attended, with over 18,000 spectators in total, a record for the WCT at that point. It was said more people were turned away from the sold-out final than had attended the entire event in 1997, which was held at Winnipeg's Granite Club.\nGames were played in eight ends, instead of the usual ten so that all the games could fit into the schedule to accommodate the playoffs, which would be shown on television. This drew criticism from some of the teams, who preferred 10 ends. The semifinals were shown on CTV Sportsnet, and the final was shown on CTV. The semis and the final were played in 10 ends.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nThe event included the top 20 teams in the world, plus three European teams. Sweden's Peja Lindholm rink was the sponsor's exemption, after Mike Harris turned it down. Another notable missing team was Ed Werenich.\nThe teams were as follows:\n\n\n=== Round-robin standings ===\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the playoffs.\nFinal round-robin standings \n\n\n== Scores ==\nScores were as follows:\n\n\n=== Draw 1 ===\nHoward 6, Spriggs 3\nShymko 5, Martin 4\nOlson 4, Korte 2\nMoffatt 3, Hartung 2\nDuguid 5, Peters 4\n\n\n=== Draw 2 ===\nHemmings 7, Scales 3\nEggler 5, Harcourt 4\nMiddaugh 5, Nedohin 4\nMorissette 8, McMillan 5\nStoughton 6, Ryan 3\n\n\n=== Draw 3 ===\nBurtnyk 5, Heidt 4\nLindholm 8, McAulay 7\nShymko 6, Spriggs 5\nMartin 6, Korte 4\nHoward 7, Olson 6\n\n\n=== Draw 4 ===\nStoughton 6, Morissette 4\nHemmings 5, Ryan 4\nMcMillan 4, Scales 1\nNedohin 6, Harcourt 4\nMiddaugh 7, Hartung 1\n\n\n=== Draw 5 ===\nMoffatt 5, Eggler 4\nPeters 6, Heidt 5\nBurtnyk 6, Lindholm 3\nDuguid 6, McAulay 5\nKorte 6, Spriggs 2\n\n\n=== Draw 6 ===\nOlson 6, Martin 4\nHoward 4, Shymko 1\nHemmings 7, Morissette 5\nRyan 6, Scales 1\nMcMillan 6, Stoughton 2\n\n\n=== Draw 7 ===\nHarcourt 5, Hartung 2\nMiddaugh 6, Moffatt 5\nNedohin 5, Eggler 3\nPeters 6, Lindholm 4\nBurtnyk 8, McAulay 4\n\n\n=== Draw 8 ===\nHeidt 9, Duguid 4\nOlson 8, Spriggs 5\nHoward 6, Martin 4\nKorte 9, Shymko 5\nScales 6, Morissette 4\n\n\n=== Draw 9 ===\nRyan 4, McMillan 3\nStoughton 6, Hemmings 3\nHarcourt 5, Moffatt 4\nMiddaugh 8, Eggler 2\nNedohin 7, Hartung 2\n\n\n=== Draw 10 ===\nPeters 6, McAulay 4\nBurtnyk 5, Duguid 3\nHeidt 8, Lindholm 3\nMartin 8, Spriggs 3\nOlson 5, Shymko 2\n\n\n=== Draw 11 ===\nMoffatt 5, Nedohin 2\nHartung 7, Eggler 3\nRyan 7, Morissette 6\nMcMillan 6, Hemmings 1\nMiddaugh 6, Harcourt 2\n\n\n=== Draw 12 ===\nKorte 6, Howard 5\nHeidt 7, McAulay 5\nStoughton 7, Scales 1\nPeters 6, Burtnyk 5\nDuguid 7, Lindholm 5\n\n\n=== Tiebreakers ===\n\n\n== Playoffs ==\n\n\n=== Semifinals ===\nMarch 20  \n\n\n=== Final ===\nMarch 21  \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Christiaan Alexander \"Lex\" Muller (Alkmaar, the Netherlands, 18 April 1923 - Delden, The Netherlands, August 8, 2004) was a Dutch radio engineer, radio astronomer and professor at Leiden University and the University of Twente. As the chief engineer he pioneered Dutch radio astronomy with the radio telescopes of Kootwijk, Dwingeloo (Dwingeloo Radio Observatory), and Westerbork (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope), where he designed the receiver system. Because of his work with Dutch astronomer Jan Oort on the determination of the spiral structure of the Milky Way using the 21 cm hydrogen radio line emission observed with the Kootwijk telescope, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1961 by Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad and Karl Ingve Öhman.\nMuller was a professor with the Astronomy department at Leiden University from 1959 to 1972 in the field of Microwave technology and its application in astronomy, physics and chemistry (Dutch: Techniek van de microgolven en hun toepassing in de sterrenkunde, natuurkunde en scheikunde), where he mentored two PhD students, Wim Brouw and Jaap van Nieuwkoop. His inaugural address of June 2, 1961 was entitled Microwave technology in astronomy (original Dutch: De microgolftechniek in de sterrenkunde). He moved to the department of Electrical engineering (Electrotechniek) at the University of Twente, where he taught Microwave technology from 1971 up to 1984.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nMuller's publications include:\n\nMuller, C.

It reaches an altitude of 1,806 meters.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nPèira arsa means \"burnt stone\" in Auvergnat, the name evoking the rocky chaos and small cliffs that form the summit.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThe Peyre-Arse is formed by two trachyandesite flows dated at 7.8 million years ago, which form a \"cliff\" at the summit (visible in the photo). These flows overlay lahars composed of ash and pumice.\n\n\n=== Access ===\nThe easiest ascent route is the GR 4 to the west, which follows the ridge line between Puy Mary and Peyre-Arse. Access is also possible from the southeast (Col de Cabre), but the ascent is significantly more strenuous.\n\n\n== In culture ==\n\nThe painter Théodore Rousseau traveled to Cantal in 1830 and produced numerous studies, including that of the Saint-Vincent-de-Salers valley. The valley is crossed by the Mars River and is home to many villages. Puy Mary is at the center, with the small peak of Puy de Peyre-Arse to its left, and below the sharp peak to the right is the Col du Redondet.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The June 2024 Ukraine peace conference is a planned international peace conference in relation to the February 2022 Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to be held in Bürgenstock Resort in Switzerland in June 2024. The proposed conference follows a series of four earlier international meetings.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Ukrainian 10-point proposal ===\n\nIn November 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a 10-point peace plan, on the issues of nuclear safety; Food security for Asian and African countries; Ukraine's energy infrastructure; the release of  prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children deported to Russia; restoration of the 1991 Russia–Ukraine border; withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine; prosecutions for war crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine; handling of ecological damage; guarantees against future Russian aggression; and a peace conference and international treaty. In December 2022, Zelenskyy called for the G7 states to support the plan.\n\n\n=== Series of four meetings ===\nA series of four international conferences aiming at a peaceful resolution of the February 2022 Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine preceded the planned June 2024 Swiss conference.\nOn 24 June 2023, the first meeting was held in Copenhagen, including representatives from Ukraine, G7 states, the European Union (EU), India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey, with the aim of building wide international support for a peace process based on the Ukrainian 10-point proposal. A European Commission official stated that there was emerging consensus at the meeting that the peace process should be based on the United Nations Charter principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nA second meeting was held during 5–6 August 2023 in Jeddah, including representatives from about 40 countries, including China, India, EU member states, India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, Zambia, Egypt and the United States (US). Agreements were made to establish working groups on the themes of the Ukrainian 10-point peace proposal and an ambassadors' group. The aim of holding a meeting at the heads-of-state level was \"considered plausible\" for later in 2023. Kyiv Post described the Ukriainian 10-point plan as \"broadly\" gaining support at the meeting.\nA third meeting was organised on the weekend of 28–29 October 2023 in Malta among national security advisors from 65 states from Europe, South America, the Arab world, Africa and Asia.\nA fourth meeting was held in mid-January 2024 Davos prior to the World Economic Forum, with representatives from 83 countries and international organisations participating, including 18 from Asia, without China, and 12 from Africa. Co-chair of the meeting, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, stated that the meeting had \"clarified points up for discussion\", that neither Ukraine nor Russia accepted territorial concessions, and that a high-level meeting had not been scheduled. On 15 January, following the meeting, Swiss president Viola Amherd stated that Switzerland was planning to organise a \"possible peace conference\".\n\n\n== Exploratory phase and preparations ==\nFollowing talks with Zelenskyy in January 2024, Swiss officials started an exploratory phase of discussions with representatives of the European Union, China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia in relation to a possible high-level peace conference that \"builds\" on the series of four national-advisor level conferences.\nOn 10 April 2024, the Swiss Federal Council stated that the conference would be held at Bürgenstock Resort in June 2024. Possible dates suggested for the conference were 16–17 June 2024. Swiss representatives aimed at convincing representatives from a wide variety of states to participate, with Cassis visiting China and India for this purpose.\nGabriel Lüchinger of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Ignazio Cassis were responsible for groups preparing the conference.\n\n\n== Aims ==\nThe conference aims to conduct high-level discussion on a \"comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" in the context of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and to develop plans for achieving peace.\nAccording to The Kyiv Independent, the conference would include discussions of the Ukrainian 10-point peace proposal.\n\n\n== Participating states ==\nAs of 8 April 2024, representatives from 80 to 100 states were expected to be invited to the conference. The possible participation of China was seen as a key issue. A Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that \"listen[ing] to the Global South, which [would] play a key role in the eventual inclusion of Russia in the process\" was significant. French president Emmanuel Macron confirmed French participation.\nAs of 9 April 2024, the probability of Russian participation was unclear. China was \"examining the possibility of taking part\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jamil Mezher (also transliterated from Arabic as Mazhar, full name Jamil Saleh Abdullah Mezher; Arabic: جميل صالح عبد الله مزهر; born 16 July 1964, Gaza), is a socialist Palestinian militant and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist–Leninist Palestinian nationalist organisation since 2022.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Gaza in 1964, to a family of refugees that settled in the Nuseirat refugee camp. he joined the PFLP in 1980, when he was 16 years old. He holds a bachelor's degree in administration. For his activities he was detained by Israeli forces twice, once in 1989, and once in 1992. He began rising through the ranks, and especially following the Gaza Civil War between Fatah and Hamas, he became a key part of restructuring the Front's administrative, political and organizational system in the Gaza strip. The PFLP at this time especially in Gaza fell into complete disarray and lost relevance, however, Mezher and others managed to cause a \"renaissance\" of the PFLP in Gaza by laying the foundations of the Front's organization and solidifying it's structure. He eventually became the head of the PFLP in the Gaza strip. During the Gaza war of 2008–2009 he was the subject of an Israeli assassination attempt at Nuseirat where his home was targeted, which he survived. He played a key part in organizing and establishing several civil societies and charities with leftist and progressive natures. During the Eighth National Congress of the Popular Front in May 2022 h\ne was elected as the Deputy Secretary-General of the PFLP. He played an important role in organizing the PFLP in preparation for, and following the start of the Gaza war of 2023–2024, and he left the strip a month before it's start, for Syria.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bạch Hải Đường (1950–1983), whose real name was Nguyễn Ngọc Truyện, was known as the phantom thief (Vietnamese: siêu trộm) in southern Vietnam from 1970 to 1982. He was wanted by the both the pre-1975 National Police and the later Public Security Forces.\nBạch Hải Đường was believed to have never killed anyone and that he had only actually used his gun once in a gold robbery, which was also the reason the police started to use lethal force on him. During one of his arrest, he confessed that he used all stolen money for himself. However, since Bạch Hải Đường wasn't known to be a wasteful spender, there were rumours that he donated his money to charity.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nBorn to a poor family in 1950 Long Xuyên, Nguyễn Ngọc Truyện was the son of Nguyễn Văn Của, a porter, and Lê Thị Huê, a bread seller. In 1962, his father was accused of being a bandit and was shot dead on the street by the police. His mother left the town while he was adopted by his uncle. In 1969, Nguyễn Ngọc Triệu married and moved to Cần Thơ for some time to avoid being drafted.\n\n\n=== Before 1975 ===\nIn 1971, Truyện's son fell ill and with no money to buy medicine, he and some of his friends formed a robber band. They often aimed at rich families, Vietnamese bureaucrats, and foreign officials in An Giang, even went as far as robbing a military base. Captain Nguyễn Văn Triệu, Deputy Commander of Long Xuyên Town Police Forces, issued an arrest warrant for Nguyễn Ngọc Truyện under the name Bạch Hải Đường (literally means \"White Malus\"), calling him \"general of robbers\" (Vietnamese: tướng cướp).\n\n\n==== Captain Triệu and Bạch Hải Đường ====\nCaptain Nguyễn Văn Triệu was a police officer of South Vietnam. He was well known for his brutal way of dealing with criminals in the region of the time, though it was believed that Captain Triệu was financially supported by two gang groups. Triệu was even awarded with the \"Third Class Hero\" medal (huân chương \"Anh dũng hạng Ba\") by Brigadier General Trần Văn Hai.\nAs Bạch Hải Đường became more famous, Captain Triệu had ordered his men to kill the phantom thief on sight. Bạch Hải Đường decided to play a trick on Captain Triệu. While his gang was distracting Triệu's men elsewhere, he and two others broke into the captain's home. They quickly attacked and locked the house servant in the toilet room. Triệu's wife was reading when Bạch Hải Đường opened her room door, pointing a gun at her. After introducing his name, Bạch Hải Đường ordered his partner to tie her up and they began to pillage the house.\nBạch Hải Đường then called the police station to inform Captain Triệu that he had \"borrowed some of his stuff\". Two days later, wanted posters were issued, stating that \"Nguyễn Ngọc Truyện aka Bạch Hải Đường is a particularly dangerous robber who has committed many crimes and harmed the security of the National Government.\"\n\n\n=== Since 1975 ===\nAfter the Reunification Day, Bạch Hải Đường was arrested by the new government, but managed to break free. After escaping another prison, he committed a gold robbery, was shot at the leg, and was imprisoned again. In 1980, he broke free again. Three years later, he was shot and arrested again. Due to having many untreated injuries, Bạch Hải Đường passed away at the age of 33.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBạch Hải Đường divorced his first wife in 1972 and married a woman named Nguyễn Thị Lệ. However, Lệ later reported Bạch Hải Đường's crime to the police, causing their relationship to end. He had four younger sisters, two sons with his first wife, and another son with his second wife. He learned martial arts from his uncle.\n\n\n== Opinions ==\nA wife of Bạch Hải Đường's friend said that he had a gentle manner and a gander face, he spoke politely and knew how to behave in front of his elders. Though, she also marked that the thief's eyes and voice were sharp and scary whenever he \"worked\".\nSome described Bạch Hải Đường as \"a gallant giang hồ\" who \"robbed the rich to give to the poor\", while others believed he was just \"a petty thief\" that Captain Triệu couldn't catch and the story about \"general of robbers\" was created to prevent humiliation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGentleman thief\n\nCharles E.

        "content": "On 12 April 2024, 14-year-old Benjamin Achimeir (Hebrew: בנימין אחימאיר, romanized: Binyamin Achimair) was declared missing after he left a farm near the Israeli outpost of Malachei HaShalom to go shepherding in the West Bank, sparking a 24-hour search by Israeli authorities. The following day, his body was found by a drone near the area he went missing. His death was attributed to blunt trauma, but his body also had stab wounds. Israeli authorities ruled the killing as a terrorist attack, attributing it to \"one or more Palestinian terrorists\". His disappearance sparked Israeli settler attacks that escalated after his body was found. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been accused of allowing these attacks to take place and actively participating in them.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAt least 160 Israeli settlements have been built in the West Bank, housing over 700,000 Jews. They have been declared illegal by the international community, but the claim is disputed by Israel. The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since 1967. The territory saw a surge of violence since the beginning of 2023, which escalated following the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war. According to Palestinian reports, at least 462 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October, while at least 13 Israelis have been killed within the same period.\n\n\n== Disappearance and discovery of body ==\nAt around 6:30 am (03:30 GMT), Achimeir left the Gal Yosef farm near the outpost of Malachei HaShalom and around 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the village of al-Mughayyir, to go shepherding. His sheep returned to the farm without him, which is when he was declared missing. His sister, Hannah, told Agence France-Presse that he was familiar with the area and often herded sheep there. The circumstances of his disappearance are currently unknown sparking fears of a kidnapping. The Israeli military (IDF) was initially unsure whether or not it was terrorism-related.\n\nThe incident sparked a massive search, during which Israeli ground, air, police, and special forces scanned the area and blocked roads. Thousands of volunteers from across the country joined to search for Achimeir. The chief of the IDF Central Command, Yehuda Fox, the head of its West Bank division, Yaakov Dolf, and Binyamin Brigade commander Liron Bitton went to the scene and led the search, according to the IDF. People with information regarding Achimair's disappearance were asked to call the Israel Police hotline or the Binyamin Police Station.\nOn 13 April, Achimeir's body was found in the same region he went missing by a drone operated by the 636th Combat Intelligence Collection unit of the Border Defense Corps after a 24-hour search. His personal belongings and clothes were scattered around the area of the body, and were handed over to police. His death was ruled as a terrorist attack by Israeli authorities. His body was found during an escalation of violence in the territory, where tensions have already been high. \nA funeral for Achimeir was held on 14 April in the Givat Shaul neighborhood of Jerusalem, the city where he is from. Hundreds of people attended, including David Lau, Yitzhak Yosef, and Zvi Sukkot.\n\n\n=== Investigation ===\nDue to the possible motive of the murder, the Shin Bet took the lead in the investigation, and the organization, along with the IDF and Israel Police, were ordered by Netanyahu to conduct operations in Palestinian towns near the area of the disappearance. In a joint statement, the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israel police estimated that Achimeir was killed by blunt force. Achimeir's body was found with marks that resembled a stabbing attack, but the IDF did not publish specific details about the death. The killing attributed was to \"one or more Palestinian terrorists\".\nIsrael Police and IDF civil administration confiscated equipment in the Gal Yosef farm, including water hoses used to dispense drinking water for the farmers and livestock. The seizure was condemned by National Defense Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir since it occurred within the week Achimeir died. Ben-Gvir called it \"terrible callousness, moral confusion, a security folly, and disrespect for the dead.\" He added that destroying the farm instead of constructing further farms and expanding the settlement would be \"surrendering to the enemy\". An Israeli defense official confirmed that there was no intention to demolish the farm.\n\n\n== Resulting settler violence ==\n\nFollowing Achimeir's disappearance, Israeli settler attacks took place in nearby Palestinian villages, which escalated following the discovery of his body. At least four people were killed and dozens of Israelis and Palestinians were wounded. According to the Israeli human rights agency Yesh Din, at least ten villages came under attack. In response, the IDF deployed extra troops and Border Police to the area.\n\n\n=== Al-Mughayyir ===\nOn 12 April, during midday, hundreds of Israeli settlers armed with firearms and stones stormed the village of al-Mughayyir, Ramallah, around 500 metres (1,600 ft) west of the settlement Achimair was last seen. The settlers were participating in the search for the boy. The head of the village council, Amin Abu Alia, estimated that around 1,000 to 1,200 settlers encircled the village, and around 500 entered. The settlers initially blocked the roads in the area, but then began to attack it, raiding homes and starting fires. Shots were also fired at residents, resulting in clashes. A video showed houses and vehicles in the village on fire. Around 25 people were injured in the attack, and 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia was killed. It is unclear if his death was caused by settlers or Israeli soldiers. \nAt least eight of the wounded were struck by gunfire. 70 sheep were also reportedly stolen. At around 3:00 pm, the IDF arrived at the scene. According to Abu Alia, the soldiers did not act to prevent the attacks, and instead allowed settlers to raid homes while preventing Palestinians from moving around and blocking ambulances from reaching the injured. The Palestinian Red Crescent said 11 ambulances were dispatched, and several people were wounded by bullet fragments. According to the IDF, security forces were sent to disperse the riots, and rocks were thrown at soldiers, who then responded with live fire. It added that soldiers worked alongside Israel Border Police to remove Israeli settlers who entered the village.\nThe following day, dozens of settlers returned to the village, setting 12 houses and several cars ablaze. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that three people were injured, one critically. Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets against villagers who gathered, in an attempt to disperse them. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said that settlers opened fire at its workers and set one of their cars ablaze.\n\n\n=== Abu Falah ===\nOn 13 April, at least five Palestinians were reportedly wounded after an Israeli settler attack on the village of Abu Falah, close to Ramallah.\n\n\n=== Beitin ===\nIn Beitin, a village near Ramallah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that 17-year-old Omar Hameed died from his wounds hours after being shot by settlers. The Palestinian Red Crescent said that at least 20 others were wounded, and a photographer for the Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, was also assaulted by settlers, some of whom were wearing military costumes.\n\n\n=== Duma ===\nAt least four Palestinians were wounded when Israeli settlers raided the village of Duma. During the raid, several houses and at least 40 cars were set ablaze. Shaul Golan, an Israeli photographer and journalist for Ynet, was beaten by settlers while covering the attack. He suffered a broken hand and his equipment was destroyed. Some of the settlers were masked, while others wore military uniforms. In an interview, Golan said that he begged who he thought were soldiers to help him, but then realized that they were not soldiers and were working with the settlers.\nThe head of the Duma village council, Suleiman Dawabsha, told reporters that around 300 Israeli soldiers stormed the village along with hundreds of settlers. The IDF did not make a statement regarding the claim. A resident of the village whose home was set on fire said that soldiers were present but did not stop the attack. The attack mirrored a similar incident in 2015, when an extremist settler set a house ablaze in the village, killing three and injuring one.\nHaaretz staff went to Duma on 13 April 2024, describing that \"as the riots were still going on, a number of [Israeli] settlers could be seen leaving the village toward the main road where soldiers and Border Police officers were stationed. The settlers then got in their cars and drove off. No law enforcement officer present tried to detain or ask them if they'd been involved in the riots.\"\n\n\n=== Aqraba ===\nAccording to Salah Bani Jaber, the mayor of Aqraba, Nablus, around 50 settlers attacked the town, many of them armed. The settlers assaulted and fired shots at residents, leading to two deaths. Jaber told Reuters that Israeli soldiers were present at the scene, but did not intervene and instead stood by and watched the attack. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the soldiers blocked ambulances from reaching the wounded. According to the IDF, soldiers were dispatched to the area and intervened to halt the clashes.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Murder ===\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that the assailants would be found and told Israelis to not get in the way of security forces. He also called the incident a heinous murder and a serious crime, and sent condolences to Achimeir's family and vowed to capture his murderers. The murder was also condemned by the United States Department of State, who expressed sympathy towards Achimeir's friends and family, the United Kingdom, and Belgium.\n\n\n=== West Bank attacks ===\n\n\n==== Israel ====\nThe settler attacks in the West Bank were criticized by Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, who called them violent riots and urged Israel to intervene to prevent further violence.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned against revenge attacks in the West Bank, saying that they would make it more difficult for Israeli forces in their mission.\nDahlia Scheindlin of Haaretz in April 2024 contrasted the Israeli reaction to the Huwara rampage in February 2023 to the Israeli reaction to the April 2024 settler attacks - in the earlier event: \"Many Israelis immediately labeled the Hawara events a pogrom ... they were still shocked by the collective vengeance and mob violence ... There was reckoning, conversation and some condemnation from a few political leaders\", but in the later event, \"in the days since Ahimeir's killing and the vigilante terror on Palestinian villages, the events have hardly registered in the [Israeli] public discourse .... all of it seems like background noise. On the Israeli side, is Israeli mob and vigilante violence, extrajudicial killing or sheer terrorism becoming routine and forgettable?\"\n\n\n==== Palestine ====\nPalestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa condemned the attack on al-Mughayyir and urged authorities to assist the people of the village. He later issued a statement condemning the other attacks in the West Bank, and said that they would not discourage the Palestinian people from standing on their land.\nHamas issued a statement urging Palestinians to fight against \"settler militias\" on the day Achimeir's body was found.\nSuleiman Dawabsha, the mayor of the village of Dufa, told AFP that the West Bank \"has been in a state of war\" since the day Achimeir disappeared.\n\n\n==== International ====\nThe United States Department of State condemned the rising violence in the West Bank and encouraged Israel and the Palestinian Authority to de-escalate the situation. Spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that \"civilians are never legitimate targets\" and called on authorities to protect all communities from harm.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office released a statement calling on Israel to take immediate and concrete steps to end the escalating violence in the West Bank. United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese urged the UN to deploy a \"protective presence\" in the area to prevent and repel attacks against civilians, saying that the IDF had proven that it is unable to do so.\nThe Arab League denounced the settler attacks, which it said were often perpetrated under Israeli approval and protection. It added that the attacks are \"exacerbating a pervasive state of impunity and continued oppression of Palestinian lives and properties\".\nThe Foreign Ministry of the United Kingdom said it was alarmed by the increase in violence in the West Bank and said that it was causing an increase of violence in the wider region as well. It also urged Israeli authorities to conduct investigations into all of the deaths.\nThe Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the rising settler violence, saying that attacks on civilians should cease and their perpetrators should be brought to justice. It also condemned Israeli settlements, which it described as illegal and an obstacle to peace.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalestinian political violence\n2014 Gush Etzion kidnapping and murder\nIsraeli settler violence\nIsraeli incursions in the West Bank during the Israel–Hamas war\n\n\n== References ==",

Labour, the Green Party and the Conservatives have put forth candidates for all seats up for election. The Liberal Democrats are also contesting every seat except Cheshunt South and Theobalds Ward.

        "content": "Andrews House is a historic building at 13 Brown Street on the campus of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. It is currently home to the Cogut Institute for the Humanities at Brown University. The building was named after the eighth president of the university E. Benjamin Andrews in 1939.\n\n\n== Winter Home ==\nThe building was designed by architect Ogden Codman Jr. in 1900–1901 to serve as a winter home for the Scottish-American industrialist Alfred M. Coats.The residence combined two parcels to form one property in excess of 23,500 square feet. \"The estates purchased,\" The Providence Daily Journal reported, \"include the Mason house at 17 Brown street and the Deacon Read estate on the corner of Charles Field and Brown Streets.\" \"The latter house,\" the journal noted, \"has stood for years as a landmark in the section of the city. It is an old-fashioned brick homestead, standing right on the street line and is at present occupied by the heirs of Deacon Read, at one time so well known in the woolen trade.\" The Providence Daily Journal estimated the cost of the project at $125,000.The Providence Daily Journal compared the house, \"built in the old Colonial style, and finished in the interior in pure marble and white decorations,\" with \"one of the old mansions along the east shore of Maryland in its surroundings, and is richly furnished. [...] large, double doors, opening from a side hall alcove to a porch of white marble, overlook[ed] the yard. On the Brown street side and in the rear as well, the yard is enclosed by a brick wall, with a gate in the rear wall, opening on the stable yard.\"\n\n\n== R.I. Governor Mansion (1915–1921) ==\nR. Livinsgton Beeckman moved to 13 Brown Street in 1913 and used the building while in office from 1915 to 1921. The \"executive residence\" was the site of an annual reception for members of the [R.I.] Legislature as well as an annual dinner for members of the press.During that time, the building housed Beeckman's personal collection of four French and Flemish tapestries and four embroidered armorial tapestries from the 16th and 18th centuries, which were briefly exhibited at the Rhode Island School of Design after Beeckman's move.In a first-person recollection of the 1919 dinner for the press, journalist David Patten (who started his career as a reporter in 1918 and went on to become the managing editor of the Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin) recalled an extensive serving staff, music from a hidden string orchestra, and \"RLB\" engraved silverware.\n\n\n== Faculty Club (1922–1938) ==\nBrown University acquired the building in 1922 to house faculty and graduate students and converted the first floor into its faculty club. The new facility opened in March 1923 on Visiting Day in the presence of \"more than 200 alumni, many members of the corporation and board of trustees, and practically all the faculty.\"The ballroom was kept \"for the holding of meetings and for social purposes,\" with white and gold walls and panels of light blue and cream-colored velvet velour. Other features included, on the first floor, a lounge, a library and a dining room, the latter two rooms \"exquisitely finished in brown oak\"; in the basement, \"a commodious room where billiards will afford relaxation\"; and a new steam heating system to serve the apartments of \"bachelor members\" of the faculty and graduate student body.\n\n\n== Brown University Infirmary and Health Services (1939–2021) ==\nA $300,000 gift by Charles Henry Hare (Class of 1885) made the conversion of the building into Brown's infirmary possible together its naming for E. Benjamin Andrews, president of Brown University from 1889 to 1898.  The new infirmary included X-ray machinery and a developing room in the basement; a waiting room, a medical office, a surgical office on the first floor; a dental office on the second floor; and rooms for in-patients.Brown University Health Services moved to a new location on Brook Street in 2021. The building served as a temporary home for the Department of Africana Studies in 2022–23. Brown University announced  in 2022 the renovation of Andrews House to become the home of the Cogut Institute for Humanities.\n\n\n== External Links ==\nRhode Island Historic Property Record for the National Register of Historic Places\nProvidence Preservation Society 2003 Guide to Providence Architecture entry\nc.1910–c.1920 photograph in the Harold Mason Photograph Collection of the Providence Public Library (VM003–067)\n1939 photograph in the Brown Digital Repository (Brown University Library)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adelopoma occidentale is a species of land snail with an operculum, a terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Diplommatinidae. \n\n\n== Description ==\n(Original description) The sinistral shell is elongately turreted and scarcely sinuate. Its sculpture has a somewhat distant well marked costulation The colour is white. The spire is rather attenuate and had a blunt apex. The suture is deep. The shell contains six whorls with tumid sides. The body whorl is small, the penultimate whorl much the broadest, those above becoming gradually swollen to the apex. The aperture is small, subvertical and round. The peristome is continuous, closely double. The columellar margin is weak, no tooth, the twist on columella seen within the aperture. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species is found in Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRobinson, D.

        "content": "Giovanni Nesi (1456–1506) was a Florentine philosopher of the Renaissance.\n\n\n== Life ==\nNesi was born in Florence on 14 January 1456 to Francesco di Giovanni Nesi and Nera di Giovanni of the Spinelli family. His father served as one of the nine priori in 1456 and 1476. His family's wealth allowed Nesi to devote himself to letters and in 1495 he reported to the catasto that he did not have to work. He was a disciple of Donato Acciaiuoli and Marsilio Ficino and joined the Platonic Academy. He was prominent enough to be included in Ugolino Verino's De illustratione Urbis Florentiae. Verino also dedicated an epigram to him, Ad Ioannem Nesium, quomodo a peccatis sit abstinendum.\nNesi was a piagnone—a supporter of Girolamo Savonarola—and was actively involved in the Florentine Consulte e Pratiche. He served two terms as priore in May–June 1485 and January–February 1503 and two terms as one of the eight ufficiali of the Studio Fiorentino in 1497 and 1499. From 11 July 1505 to 5 January 1506, he was podestà of Prato, where he reformed the local statutes.\nNesi died at Florence between 15 November and 15 December 1506 and was buried in Santa Croce.\n\n\n== Works ==\nNesi was at first, like his master, Acciaiuoli, an Aristotelian and a civic humanist. Under the influence of Ficino, he gradually turned to Neoplatonism and praise for the Medici. After Savonarola's return to Florence in 1490, Nesi experienced a religious conversion.\n\n\n=== Sermons ===\nBetween 1472 and 1486, Nesi preached a series of sermons in vernacular Tuscan before the lay confraternities of Florence.\n\nIoannis Nesii adulescentuli oratiuncula, preached before the Company of Saint Nicholas on 13 December 1472\nOrazione del Corpo di Cristo, preached before the Company of Saint Anthony of Padua on 7 April 1474\nOrazione de Eucharestia, preached before the Company of Saint Anthony on 23 March 1475\nOrazione sull'umiltà, preached before the Confraternity of the Nativity on 11 April 1476\nSulla carità, preached before the Confraternity of the Nativity on 25 February 1478\nDe charitate, preached before the Confraternity of the Magi on 23 March 1486\nPassione di Cristo, year unknown\n\n\n=== Books ===\nDe moribus (1484) is a dialogue in four books dedicated to Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici. It is preserved in manuscript Plutei 77.24 in the Laurentian Library. It is an imagined discussion about Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in the house of Donato Acciaiuoli in 1477. The other participants, besides Acciaiuoli, were Jacopo Salviati, Filippo Valori, Bernardo di Alamanno de' Medici and Antonio Lanfredini. They are primarily concerned with good citizenship. The fourth book takes a Neoplatonic turn. In 1503, Nesi revised the work for publication, dedicating it to the youth of Florence. The revised version is found in manuscript 194 of the Burgerbibliothek of Bern, but it was never published.\nOraculum de novo saeculo was published at Florence by Lorenzo Morgiani in 1497. Dedicated to Giorgio Benigno Salviati in draft, the published work was dedicated to Giovanfrancesco Pico della Mirandola. Nesi describes a grand vision of things to come that Pico's uncle, Giovanni, then explains as revealing what Savonarola is building in Florence.\nIn the Symbolum nesianum, Nesi explains to the Camaldolese friar Paolo Orlandini the imagery he used in the Oraculum.\nNesi wrote two collections of poems, Canzoniere (1497–1498) and the incomplete Poema in terza rima (1499).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Toy Town\" is a happy hardcore track by British duo DJ Hixxy and MC Sharkey.  Released in 1995, the single was a hit in the UK clubbing scene, peaked at number 24 in the UK dance singles chart, and had a pivotal impact in the UK rave music scene with a move away from breakbeat towards the newer happy hardcore \"cheesy\" sound.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe track, written and produced by DJ Hixxy and MC Sharkey, was inspired by the earlier \"toytown techno\" phase characterised by tracks such as \"Charly\" by the Prodigy.  It starts with a chopped amen break, and goes on to feature \"sugar sweet\" vocals, a \"bouncy kick\" and an \"ultra-cheesy stab pattern\". It has elements of hip hop, house, gabba and techno.  Playing at the high tempo characteristic of the \"speedrush\" of the genre, by the end of the track it has been described as going towards \"unstoppable mania\".\nIn 1994 it became a club \"anthem\", and following release on the Essential Platinum label in 1995 it peaked at number 24 in the UK Dance Singles official chart and sold c. 5,000 copies. The reception of the track was divided, with both support and detraction. MC Magika stated it was a \"was a fork in the road\" that \"almost destroyed the scene in its current form\". On the one hand it was considered a \"breath of fresh air\" due to the lack of breakbeats, that appealed to a newer generation, but on the other many found the sound to be \"cheesy\". The \"juvenile\" hardcore sound, being high tempo with pitched vocals and catchy choruses and samples, had been expected to herald the \"death of rave\" but the success of the track was cited as opposing evidence.\nThe \"cult\" success of the track led to interest from the React record label. As a result, Hixxy and Sharkey were signed to the label to create the Bonkers hardcore compilation series, which went on to have at least 19 releases from 1996 to 2009, achieving both chart and sales success even if not attaining the critical cachet of \"cooler\" sounds. \"Toy Town\" was the first track on the first compilation.\nIn a 2011 retrospective article BBC Radio 1 DJ Kutski stated that the track is a \"classic\" and \"the definition of the UK hardcore sound\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Toy Town\" ('Noddy & Bigears' Mix) - (6:13)\n\"Toy Town\" ('In Ya Face' Mix) - (5:16)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nToy Town at Discogs (list of releases) \nToy Town at AllMusic",

Snyder and Susan Hale. After their father's death in 1840, the family moved to Missouri. In fall 1856, John and Dudley moved to Round Rock, Texas, where they founded a farm.\nDuring the American Civil War, John enlisted in the Confederate States Army, while Dudley got a contract to transport and sell cattle to the Trans-Mississippi Department, also serving as a conscription officer for Williamson County.\nAfter the war, John moved cotton to South Texas to remake money the family lost during the war, while Dudley drove cattle to the High Plains region, being the first to drove cattle from Texas to Wyoming. He gave most of his money to support Southwestern University.\nDuring the January 1886 blizzard, John hired J. Frank Norfleet to do his cattle droving, and also sold the ~130,000 acres of land he owned with Dudley to Isaac L. Ellwood, who developed the land into Spade Ranch. After 1891, the brothers worked as horse traders. In 1900, Dudley was elected judge of Sherman County, beating William B. Slaughter by 4 votes. John married Catherine Jane Coffee, daughter of John T. Coffee, having 8 children with her. He died on April 14, 1922. Dudley married Mary Oatts, having 9 children with her. He died in his home in Georgetown in 1921.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn Wesley Iliff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Wesley Snyder at Find a Grave\nDudley Hiram Snyder at Find a Grave",

        "content": "Horst Schumann (6 February 1924 – 28 December 1993) was a German politician and functionary of the Free German Youth (FDJ) and the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the FDJ from 1959 to 1967 and of the SED in Bezirk Leipzig from 1970 to 1989.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nSchumann's father, Georg Schumann, was a toolmaker, KPD (Communist Party of Germany) functionary, and resistance fighter against National Socialism. In 1933, his father was taken into protective custody by the Gestapo. Even before his father's release, Schumann joined the Hitler Youth in the spring of 1939, allegedly against his will and on the recommendation of Kurt Kresse, a friend of his father, who saw it as an opportunity to disguise the family.\nHorst Schumann attended elementary school and learned the trade of piano making from 1938 to 1941. He participated in his father's resistance group, the Schumann-Engert-Kresse Group, with minor courier services. In 1943, he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and served as an infantry and anti-tank soldier and grenadier. In the last months of the war, Schumann's father was executed for his activities in the resistance. After the war, Schumann was briefly interned in American and Soviet prisoner-of-war camps and, upon his release in July 1945, sought employment in Leipzig. \n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter the liberation from National Socialism, Schumann joined the KPD in 1945 and chaired the anti-fascist youth committee in Leipzig. He became a member of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in 1946 following the forced merger of the SPD (Social Democratic Party) and KPD.\nHe was one of the co-founders of the Free German Youth (FDJ) in Leipzig and served as the First Secretary of the FDJ there from 1947 to 1948. From 1949 to 1950, he was the secretary for Young Pioneers and Schools at the FDJ regional leadership in Saxony, and after attending the Party Academy Karl Marx, he served as the First Secretary of the FDJ regional leadership in Saxony and or later the FDJ leadership in Bezirk Leipzig after the states were dissolved in 1953. From 1953, he was a member of the Committee of Antifascist Resistance Fighters.\nDespite superiors repeatedly praising his agitational skills and leading example, he was also criticized for his lack of assertiveness. Helmut Hartwig, Second Secretary of the Central Council of the FDJ, provided a particularly critical assessment, attributing to him superficiality, lack of perseverance, timidity, and insufficient understanding of people, which he attributed to the \"indulgence by the comrades in Leipzig.\" Schumann's early political career was helped significantly by the association with his father.\nIn 1952, Schumann joined the Central Council of the FDJ. After working as a sector head for Youth and Sports in the Department for Leading Organs of the Central Committee of the SED for two years, Schumann pursued studies at the CPSU Higher Party School in Moscow, obtaining a diploma in Social Sciencesin 1959.\n\n\n=== FDJ First Secretary ===\n\nIn May 1959, Schumann rose to the position of the First Secretary of the Central Council of the FDJ, succeeding Karl Namokel, who was not reelected because he had shown little skill and experience in youth work.\nInitially a candidate member since 1958 (V. Party Congress), he become a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in 1959, serving until its resignation in December 1989. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1963 and the State Council, the GDR's collective head of state, in 1960, though he left it at the start of the Honecker era in 1971.\nSchumann did not introduce his own accents in the FDJ, but he proved to be a loyal follower of Walter Ulbricht. However, Schumann found a rival in Erich Honecker, with whom he had already clashed during his FDJ tenure.\n\nAround the time of the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Central Committee of the SED introduced a kind of socialist vigilantism, an extrajudicial self-justice, to nip politically inconvenient actions in the bud. Schumann supported this idea by formalizing the brutal attacks on 13 August 1961, in the form of a combat order:\n\"No discussion with provocateurs. They are to be beaten first and then handed over to state authorities. [...] Anyone who makes even the slightest derogatory remarks about the Soviet army, about the best friend of the German people, Comrade N. S. Khrushchev, or about the Chairman of the State Council, Comrade Walter Ulbricht, must in any case receive the appropriate punishment on the spot.\"\n\n\n=== Bezirk Leipzig SED career ===\nIn 1967, Schumann had to retire from the FDJ due to his age, being succeeded by his deputy Günther Jahn. He subsequently joined the Bezirk Leipzig SED as Second Secretary in 1969, rising to the position of the First Secretary in November 1970 after longtime Paul Fröhlich surprisingly died.\nHowever, his transfer to the Leipzig party apparatus was viewed with mixed feelings at the grassroots level. While Schumann was considered a pronounced \"Ulbricht man,\" his predecessors' ability to represent the Bezirk Leipzig in the Politburo was not readily attributed to him due to his hesitant character. The change of power from Ulbricht to Honecker in May 1971 further worsened Schumann's position. Although he, like most of his colleagues, was not replaced, he found it increasingly difficult to make himself heard in Berlin. Schumann was summoned to the Central Committee less frequently, and the distance between Honecker and him was visible during state and party leadership tours.\nSchumann had a leadership style that contrasted sharply with Fröhlich's authoritarian rule. On the local level, Schumann refrained from personal interventions in existing structures. He lacked support in the central party apparatus for such actions. Unlike Fröhlich, who as a member of the Politburo was always well-informed about the mood within the inner power circle of the SED, Schumann could no longer rely on such informational advantages. Schumann personally admonished local officials only in individual cases and endeavored to resolve problems in the Bezirk quickly and as discreetly as possible, strictly adhering to the official channels, if the conflicts extended beyond the Bezirk. He used party sanctions less as a means of punishment and more as a symbolic measure for internal party discipline.\nThe poor relationship with Honecker was further clouded by the declining economic significance of Bezirk Leipzig towards the end of the 1970s. Especially due to the accelerated development of microelectronics, chemistry, and metallurgy from 1977 onwards, the Bezirk Leipzig increasingly fell out of focus of state economic planning.\nSchumann was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1964, 1974, and 1984 and the Order of Karl Marx in 1984.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\n\nDuring the Peaceful Revolution in the GDR in 1989, he was viewed by Western observers as a moderate and tolerant top SED functionary. He was not involved in the decisions regarding the Leipzig Monday Demonstrations on 9 October 1989, as he was on sick leave. His deputy, Second Secretary Helmut Hackenberg, represented him.\nOn 20 October 1989, the Politburo, now under Egon Krenz, decided to replace Schumann with Bezirk Leipzig SED Science and Education Secretary Roland Wötzel, who was seen as reform-oriented and had participated in the call for non-violence during the large demonstration on 9 October 1989, in Leipzig, known as the \"Leipzig Six.\" This also bypassed Helmut Hackenberg, who would have succeeded him if he was to officially retire for health reasons.\nHe was bid farewell by Krenz with the award of the Hero of Labour title at a meeting of the Bezirk Leipzig SED leadership.\n\n\n=== Reunified Germany ===\n\nFollowing the political changes, on 5 May 1990, he was charged by the Leipzig District Attorney's Office with incitement to electoral fraud in the municipal elections in May 1989, but his death preempted any potential conviction.\nSchumann passed away in 1993 at the age of 80 in Berlin.\nHis grave is located in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery in the gravesite for victims of fascism and persecuted by the Nazi regime.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was also the solicitor general at the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) in c. 2017. \nOn 7 June 2022, Dato Juanda was appointed as the Minister of Development. The Chinese Ambassador contacted the recently appointed Minister on 27 June 2022, to wish him well in his new role, to express gratitude for the Ministry's support of Chinese businesses in Brunei. Grace Fu and Dato Juanda co-chaired the 16th Brunei-Singapore Annual Exchange of Visits (BSAEV), which aimed to review bilateral cooperation under the Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Partnership in Environment Affairs and Climate Change in areas such as waste management, water resource management, and air quality management, as well as to exchange opinions on regional and global developments in climate change and environmental protection.\nDato Juanda stated that 184 persons had fallen behind on their rent payments, while 6,098 people had defaulted on housing loans during a 2023 Legislative Council meeting. Additionally, he stated that the department would only take legal action as a last resort against people who refuse to make payments even if they have the capacity to do so and that the agency attempts to negotiate a resolution with defaulters.\nIn March 2024, Dato Juanda and Guangxi Housing and Urban-Rural Development Department (HURD) of China had a working visit by a six-member team for a bilateral conversation.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n Order of Setia Negara Brunei First Class (PSNB; 15 July 2022) – Dato Seri Setia\n Order of Seri Paduka Mahkota Brunei Second Class (DPMB; 15 September 2013) – Dato Paduka\n\n\n== References ==",

The municipality is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite Cotabato being part of Soccsksargen.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Bangsamoro was created in 2019 to supplant the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 63 barangays in the province of Cotabato were grouped with the newer autonomous region in the second part of the plebiscite held in February 6. The mother municipalities and Cotabato province remained part of Soccsksargen.By March 2020, these barangays were designated as a Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro region.On August 17, 2023, the bills consolidating the SGA barangays into eight municipalities were approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, The particular bill creating Nabalawag was Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 131. The town was originally proposed to be named as Kabalukan.A plebiscite was held on April 13, 2024, and voters approved all eight bills reconstituting the SGA barangays to eight municipalities including Nabalawag, where 7,442 voted in favor of its creation while 14 voted against. The Bangsamoro regional government will provide P2.5 million in funding for the municipal government until it gets its share of income from the National Tax Allotment. Nabalawag was created from six barangays of Midsayap and a single barangay from Aleosan.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Barangays ===\nNabalawag is politically subdivided into seven barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks  while some have sitios.\n\n\n== Government ==\nOfficers-in-charge will be selected by BARMM Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim to fill positions in the municipal government pending regular elections in 2025. The municipality will also stay under the jurisdiction of the Special Geographic Area pending the creation of a new province.\n\n\n== References ==",

The town was initially proposed to be named as Malmar, but this was changed to Madridagao (and later Malidegao) to better reflect the area's culture and heritage.A plebiscite was held on April 13, 2024, and voters approved all eight bills reconstituting the SGA barangays to eight municipalities including Malidegao, where 12,255 voted in favor of its creation while 44 voted against.

The municipality is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite Cotabato being part of Soccsksargen.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Bangsamoro was created in 2019 to supplant the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 63 barangays in the province of Cotabato were grouped with the newer autonomous region in the second part of the plebiscite held in February 6. The mother municipalities and Cotabato province remained part of Soccsksargen.By March 2020, these barangays were designated as a Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro region.On August 17, 2023, the bills consolidating the SGA barangays into eight municipalities were approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, The particular bill creating Kapalawan was Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 133.A plebiscite was held on April 13, 2024, and voters approved all eight bills reconstituting the SGA barangays to eight municipalities including Kapalawan, where 10,495 voted in favor of its creation while two voted against. The Bangsamoro regional government will provide P2.5 million in funding for the municipal government until it gets its share of income from the National Tax Allotment. Kapalawan was created from seven barangays of Carmen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Barangays ===\nKapalawan is politically subdivided into seven barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks  while some have sitios.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Government ==\nOfficers-in-charge will be selected by BARMM Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim to fill positions in the municipal government pending regular elections in 2025. The municipality will also stay under the jurisdiction of the Special Geographic Area pending the creation of a new province.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "19th century glassmaking in the United States started slowly with less than a dozen glass factories operating. Much of the nation's better quality glass was imported, and English glassmakers had a monopoly on major ingredients for high–quality glass such as good–quality sand and red lead. A tariff and the War of 1812 added to the difficulties of making glass in America. After the war, English glassmakers began dumping low priced glassware in the United States, which caused some glass works to go out of business. A protective tariff and the ingenuity of Boston businessman Deming Jarves helped revive the domestic glass industry.\nThe 1803 Louisiana Purchase added western territory to the United States and eventually opened new markets for glass products. Glass works located along the Ohio River in Pittsburgh and Wheeling were able to take advantage of the nation's waterways to ship their products. Most of the growth of the nation's railroad industry occurred in the second half of the century, which provided an alternative to waterways for transportation. Coal, as an alternative to wood to power the glassmaking furnaces, was another factor that lured glassmakers away from the nation's east coast. By mid-century these factors, along with deforestation in the east, shifted glassmaking away from the east coast to western regions near Pittsburgh and West Virginia. The discovery of natural gas in Ohio and Indiana caused gas booms in those regions, but those sources of low-cost fuel were mismanaged and then depleted.\nTwo major discoveries transformed 19th century glassmaking in the United States. The use of a machine to press glass was developed in the 1820s, leading to more efficient production. A formula for soda–lime glass was discovered in the 1860s. This formula, which is probably similar to the long–lost formula used by Europeans centuries earlier, enabled the production of high–quality glass at a lower cost. This led to mechanical innovations throughout the second half of the century, such as better furnaces for melting the raw materials and better methods of cooling the glass. By the end of the century, research was being conducted that would make substantial changes to the way bottles and window glass were produced.\n\n\n== Glassmaking ==\n\nGlassmakers use the term \"batch\" for the sum of all the raw ingredients needed to make a particular glass product. To make glass, the glassmaker starts with the batch, melts it together, forms the glass product, and gradually cools it. The batch is dominated by sand, which contains silica. Smaller quantities of other ingredients, such as soda and limestone, are added to the batch. Additional ingredients may be added to color the glass. For example, an oxide of cobalt is used to make glass blue. Broken and scrap glass, known as cullet, is often used as an ingredient to make new glass. The cullet melts faster than the other ingredients, which results in some savings in fuel cost for the furnace. Cullet can account for 25 to 50 percent of the batch.\nThe batch is placed inside a pot or tank that is heated by a furnace to roughly 3,090 °F (1,700 °C). Tank furnaces, which were created in England in 1870, did not began to supplant pot furnaces in the United States until the 1890s. Glassmakers use the term \"metal\" to describe batch that has been melted together. The metal is typically shaped into the glass product (other than plate and window glass) by either glassblowing or pressing it into a mold. Although pressing glass by hand has long existed, mechanical pressing of glass did not exist until the 1820s—and it was an American invention. In some cases, the  glass is cut and polished, engraved, etched, or enameled. All glass products must be cooled gradually (annealed), or else they could easily break. Annealing was originally conducted in the United States using a kiln that was sealed with the fresh glass inside, heated, and gradually cooled. During the 1860s annealing kilns were replaced in the United States with conveyor ovens, called lehrs, that were less labor-intensive.\n\n\n=== Labor, fuel and transportation ===\n\nLabor was the biggest expense for manufacturers of glass. Germans dominated American glassmaking until the 19th century. Glassmaking methods and recipes were kept secret, and most European countries forbid immigration to the United States by glassworkers. Some of the skilled glassworkers were smuggled from Europe to the United States. Glass company financiers discovered that if a skilled glass worker left their company, glassmaking knowledge left with them. Boston businessman Deming Jarves, who has been called the \"father of the American glass industry\", joined the industry in 1809 as an investor. Jarves began to keep a book of glass recipes. He learned from the glassmakers he hired, and he conducted his own experiments. He also pursued knowledge about the process for melting the batch and annealing the glass. This corporate practice eliminated the risk of a skilled glassmaker leaving the company and taking know–how with him.\nThe second largest expense for glassmaking is fuel for the furnace, and fuel availability often determined the location of a glass works. Wood was the original fuel used by glassmakers in the United States. Coal began being used in the 1790s. The problem with wood was that, in good times, a glass factory could consume an amount of forest equal in size to an American football field—in one week. By 1850, glassmaking in the United States had shifted from the east coast to Pittsburgh and West Virginia because of the availability of coal and deforestation in the east. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and oil did not become available in the United States until the 1870s when they were discovered in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In the 1880s, the discovery of natural gas in northwest Ohio combined with its railroad facilities to cause numerous glass factories to relocate there. A similar gas boom followed in East Central Indiana. The gas field in Indiana was larger than the Ohio and Pennsylvania gas fields combined. Among the larger and more famous factories started was the Muncie, Indiana, glass works of the Ball brothers—makers of the Ball mason jar. Northwestern Ohio's gas boom faded as gas supply problems began around 1891. The Indiana Gas Boom was over by 1901, as gas pressure fell because of waste and mismanagement of a resource that many believed would last for decades.\nTransportation is another important factor for glassmaking. When Edward Libbey moved New England Glass Company in 1888, transportation resources were a major factor in his selection of Toledo, Ohio. Toledo had access to the Great Lakes, the Miami and Erie Canal that connected with the Ohio River, and numerous railroad lines. Waterways had provided transportation networks for the glass factories long before the construction of highways and railroads. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 opened new markets to glass factories, and those situated on the Ohio River had a waterway to ship their products. The introduction of steamboats to the western United States in 1811 made upriver transportation easier. Construction of the National Road began in 1811 in Cumberland, Maryland. The road, the nation's first federally–funded highway, reached Wheeling by 1818 and Illinois by the 1830s. The first commercial railroad in the United States was not chartered until 1827, and construction began in 1828. Pittsburgh and Wheeling had railroad service by the early 1850s, causing a decline in the use of the National Road. By June 30, 1900, the United States had over 193,000 miles (311,000 km) of rail line and over 1,200 railroads operating.\n\n\n== Beginning of the century ==\n\n\n=== England ===\nIn 1800, the United States was thought to have no more than ten glass factories operating. Most of these factories produced window glass or bottles made of green glass, and very little high quality glassware was made. The production of higher quality glass was limited by a lack of skilled glassblowers and lack of a necessary additive to the batch. Most of the glass products in the United States were imported from England, and England controlled the supply of a necessary batch additive for crystal—red lead. The U.S. Embargo Act of 1807, and then the War of 1812, made it nearly impossible for American companies to acquire red lead.\nThe War of 1812 also made it difficult to acquire good quality sand, since British ships brought the only good quality sand to the United States from the island of Demerara. After the war, England began dumping low–priced glass products in the United States while keeping its price for red lead high. The introduction of the steamboat in the United States enabled imports to move from the port of New Orleans up the Mississippi River to the western markets of the United States. The British/English competition caused some American glass factories, including Boston Crown Glass Company, to shut down.\n\n\n=== Jarves and Bakewell ===\n\nIn response to the red lead problem, American glass man Deming Jarves, one of the owners of the failed Boston Crown Glass Company, developed a way to produce red lead from domestic sources of lead oxide. He was producing significant quantities of red led by 1819. Good quality sand was found in the United States in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, in the Monongahela River in Pennsylvania, and in New Jersey. In 1820, there were only 33 glassmaking facilities in the United States. The Tariff of 1824, which was a protective tariff, helped the American glass industry. Between 1820 and 1840, nearly 70 glass factories were started in the United States. Most of these factories were small businesses employing 25 to 40 workers. Jarves' New England Glass Company, incorporated in 1818, was exporting cut crystal glassware to Europe by 1825. His skilled workers were English and German immigrants, and he smuggled Belgian workers to his glass works because of their glass cutting expertise.\nA company originally known as Bakewell & Ensell was founded in 1808 in what was then the western United States. This company, which changed its name multiple times, became Pittsburgh's best known glass manufacturer. Deming Jarves considered founder Benjamin Bakewell the \"father of the flint–glass [crystal] business in this country\". Like Jarves, Bakewell relied on skilled glassworkers that he smuggled to the United States. In Bakewell's case many of these glassworkers were from England. The company was \"gasping for breath\" during a difficult period from 1817 until 1822, but produced glass for over 70 years. In the 1820s and 1830s, Bakewell glassware was purchased for the White House by presidents James Monroe and Andrew Jackson.\n\n\n==== Pressed glass ====\nIn 1825, John P. Bakewell patented a pressing method for making glass furniture knobs. Elsewhere other glass men were also working on mechanical pressing of glass. Henry Whitney and Enoch Robinson of New England Glass Company received a pressing–related patent in 1826; and Phineas C. Dummer, George Dummer, and James Maxwell of the Jersey City Glass Works received pressing and mold–related patents in 1827. One historian has called the increased production rate caused by the mechanical pressing machine \"the greatest contribution of America to glassmaking, and the most important development since the Romans discovered glassblowing\".\nGlass had been pressed since the 1st century, but mechanical pressing was a technological advancement that lowered costs. It enabled skilled glassworkers to be replaced by unskilled workers that were more productive. A greater variety of glassware became available, and the lower costs enabled a larger segment of the public to afford lower–priced glassware. New England Glass Company and Jarves' new Boston and Sandwich Glass Company (founded in 1825) were the early users of machine pressed glass technology to produce large quantities of glass. Bakewell, Page & Bakewell was among the numerous glass works to produce pressed glass shortly afterwards.\n\n\n=== Railroads begin ===\nTransportation resources for all manufacturers began to improve during this time, as the American railroad industry began construction of railroad line. The first commercial railway, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, began work in 1828 to connect Baltimore's harbor with the Ohio River. Its first segment of track was 13 miles (21 km) long, and it opened in 1830. This segment connected Baltimore to Ellicott's Mills in Maryland (now Ellicott City). By 1835 the nation had over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of railroad line as other railroads constructed line, and by 1840 this improved to 2,818 miles (4,535 km). In 1852 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line reached the Ohio River at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia).\n\n\n== Mid–century ==\n\nGlassmaking on the East Coast of the United States peaked around 1850, as plants shifted to Pittsburgh because of the availability of coal for fuel. By 1850, the United States had 3,237 free men above age 15 who listed their occupation as part of the glass manufacturing process. Pennsylvania accounted for 40% of the glassmaking employees. Other states with more than 100 glass workers were New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia (including what is now West Virginia). The availability of rail transportation increased substantially at this time, as the nation's rail network consisted of over 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of rail line in 1850 and over 30,000 miles (48,000 km) by 1860.\n\n\n=== Pittsburgh ===\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had an early transportation advantage with the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers converging to form the Ohio River. It also had good access to coal and high–quality sand. In 1837, Pittsburgh had 15 glass works, and the nearby Pennsylvania counties of Fayette and Washington had 13 more. By mid–century, Pittsburgh was the nation's new glassmaking center, and it had as many as 33 glass works by 1857. Nine of those factories made flint glass (crystal). The remaining factories made products such as bottles and window glass. The best known Pittsburgh glass company was Bakewell, Pears and Company. The company was known for its crystal, including cut and engraved glassware. It also made window glass, bottles, and lamps.\n\n\n=== Glass formula ===\n\nTwo former supervisors from the New England Glass Company, James B. Barnes and John L. Hobbs, founded Barnes, Hobbs and Company in 1845. Their glass factory, called the South Wheeling Glass Works, was located near a coal mine on the south side of Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia). Their company was named J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company from 1863 to 1881, which includes the year the company developed a new formula for glass that changed the glassware business. The company produced all types of glassware, but did not make window glass or bottles. Products ranged from ordinary items  such as kerosene lamps to art glass valued by collectors. By 1879 the South Wheeling Glass Works was the largest glass factory in the United States. Three major innovations made by this company were the use of benzine in the polishing furnace, chilling molds using cold air, and a new formula for lime (soda–lime) glass.\nIn 1863 William Leighton Sr and his son, William Leighton Jr, left the New England Glass Company to join J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company. The elder Leighton became the company chemist. In 1864 he developed an improved formula for soda–lime glass that could be pressed and did not require lead—but produced glass with almost the same quality as crystal. The raw materials for this type of glass cost much less than crystal made with lead, and the soda–lime glass hardened faster. This made it necessary for workmen to shape the glass quicker, and encouraged innovation in shaping the glass. The result of these changes caused glassware to cost about one fourth of its earlier cost, and this caused retail prices for glassware to decrease. The lower costs led to glassware factories switching from lead crystal glass to soda–lime glass, more of the public being able to afford high–quality glassware, and more factories being built to meet demand.\n\n\n== End of the century ==\nBy 1880, 211 glassmaking factories existed in the United States, and they provided employment for 24,177 people. Of the 211 factories, 169 produced during the year, while the remaining were either idle or under construction. Glassware was produced by 73 of these factories, while 49 made window glass. Green glass was produced at 42 factories, and plate glass was made at five glass works. Based on the value of the glass produced, Pennsylvania accounted for 41 percent of production, while New Jersey accounted for 13 percent. At a more local level, the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny and Philadelphia accounted for almost 27 percent and almost eight percent of production, respectively. Other glassmaking centers, in order of market share, were: Kings County, New York; Cumberland County, New Jersey; Gloucester County, New Jersey; Belmont County, Ohio; Ohio County, West Virginia; and Floyd County, Indiana. This group of counties had shares of the value of glass production that ranged from 6.24 to 3.07 percent. Although glass was made in numerous other places, only five additional counties had a market share above two percent.\n\n\n=== Gas boom ===\n\nThe discovery of natural gas in Ohio and Indiana caused glass factories to either move operations to this source of cheap fuel or begin new companies. Although natural gas had been discovered near Findlay, Ohio, in 1884, the Karg well changed outlooks two years later. The Karg well was located in the middle of Findlay, and the flame from this well could be seen over 40 miles (64 km) away in Toledo. A decade earlier, natural gas fields had been discovered in West Virginia and near Pittsburgh. In addition to being a lower cost fuel for glass melting furnaces, it was cleaner and provided more heat. Communities such as Findlay, Fostoria, North Baltimore, Tiffin, and Toledo offered free gas as an incentive for manufacturers to relocate. Over 100 glass companies moved to (or started in) northwest Ohio to take advantage of gas from Findlay's gas field and a smaller one nearby in North Baltimore. The gas supply lasted for only five years, causing most of the glass companies to move closer to better sources of fuel. Examples of companies that relocated are Fostoria Glass Company, which moved from Fostoria to Moundsville, West Virginia; and Sneath Glass Company, which moved from Tiffin to Hartford City, Indiana.\nNatural gas was first discovered in Indiana in Pulaski County in 1865. The drillers were searching for oil, but found only gas. Unaware of the usefulness of natural gas, the drillers abandoned the well. A more significant discovery was made in the small East Central Indiana community of Eaton, Indiana. This well was bored in 1876 to a depth of 600 feet (180 m), and the drillers were searching for coal. When they instead found gas that gave a flame two feet (0.61 m) high, the well was ignored. In 1886, after hearing about the gas boom in Ohio, the Eaton well was re–drilled. Gas was discovered at a depth of 922 feet (281 m), and flames about ten feet (3.0 m) high rose from four pipes in the well. More wells were drilled, and gas was found in significant quantities in 17 Indiana counties. The Indiana gas field was the largest in the world, and it was larger than those of Pennsylvania and Ohio combined. Indiana had its own gas boom, and East Central Indiana changed from an \"agricultural district\" to industrial. Glassmaking was one of the industries that moved to Indiana. In 1880, the state ranked eighth in glass production. By 1890, it ranked fourth. In terms of the number of glass factories, the state had four in 1880 and 21 in 1890. By 1895, there were 50 glass factories in Indiana. The state also benefitted from excellent railroad facilities and a coal field not far away from the gas belt. This enabled some factories to remain in Indiana after the gas supply became depleted. The citizens of Indiana did not learn from their Ohio neighbors, and they wasted gas despite warnings from the state geologist. The Indiana Gas Boom was over by 1901.\n\n\n=== Libbey and Owens ===\n\nIn 1888 Edward Libbey moved the New England Glass Company from East Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Toledo, Ohio. Among new hires in late 1888 was glassblower Michael Joseph Owens, a former worker at the glass works of J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company who wanted to be a foreman. In 1892 the company changed its name to Libbey Glass Company. Owens (1859–1923) received 49 patents and brought automation to the glass industry. During the early 1890s, he created a machine that would blow light bulbs into molds. His process was more profitable and required fewer skilled laborers.\nIn 1898 Owens began work on an automatic bottle machine. Newer versions of his bottle machine were created, and over 330 machines produced between 1908 and 1927. His bottle machine could produce 24 bottles per minute, compared to a glassblower producing one per minute. This higher production rate, with standardized shapes and sizes, changed the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries by making it possible for those industries to mechanize their capacity for filling the glass product. Things such as milk bottles, beer bottles, fruit jars, and other glass items became common because they could be produced at lower costs. Later Owens teamed with Irving Wightman Colburn to create a radically different way to produce window glass, which became known as the Colburn process. This process was first used in 1917.\n\n\n==== Child labor ====\n\nChild labor has been described as a \"scourge of the late 19th century\". The three largest industrial employers of children were coal mines, glass factories, and textile mills. Leaders in the glassmaking industry described the employment of children, some as young as 10 years old, as essential for certain tasks—and they were cheap labor. About 20 to 45 percent of laborers at glass factories were children, and some were aged eight to twelve. They typically moved items, cleaned, and helped with the annealing process. They were also involved with packaging glassware. One of the few states that had laws protecting children was Ohio, which banned children under the age of 12 from working in a factory. Ohio also prohibited work in excess of ten hours per day for children who were old enough to work.\nNew machinery, plus new regulations, led to a decline in the use of child labor during the last decade of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Of the approximately 19,000 workers added to the glassmaking industry between 1890 and 1905, 18,000 were adult men. Many of these new workers were immigrants. Belgium, England, France, and Germany typically contributed skilled workers—while immigrants from other countries were usually used for the lowest-paying jobs. A by-product of the new wave of automation was the reduced need for child laborers. Owens' invention of an automated mold for the production of light bulbs eliminated the need for mold boys in light bulb production. The John H. Lubbers glass blowing machine (machine drawn window glass) eliminated the need for glassblowers in the window glass making process. Owens' bottle machine contributed to a reduction in child labor in two ways. In addition to the labor savings from using a machine to make bottles, the uniformity in the size of the bottles made possible the development of high-speed packing and filling lines that also provided labor savings. The National Child Labor Committee of New York commended the Owens machine, in 1913, for its role in eliminating child labor.\n\n\n=== Economics and glass trusts ===\n\nThe end of the 19th century, despite the many glassmaking innovations, was difficult for many manufacturing companies. The U.S. economy suffered through six recessions during the 1880s and 1890s, making life difficult for manufacturing firms. Three banking panics occurred during this period: the Panic of 1884, the Panic of 1890, and the Panic of 1893—which was one of the most severe in the nation's history. Estimates of the unemployment rate for 1890 through 1900 show five or six years (depending on whose estimates are used) of double-digit unemployment. From 1880 to 1900, consumer prices in the United States decreased nearly 14 percent, and changes for any year were either a decrease or no change. Adding to the glass companies' challenges was the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, which caused glass imports to increase 48 percent. Several years later, the Dingley Tariff of 1897 countered some of the competition from imports caused by the Wilson-Gorman tariff.\nCost cutting was done because of necessity, as manufacturers fought to survive. In the glass industry, several trusts were formed in attempts to cut costs, control supply, and control prices. Among the trusts were the National Glass Company, United States Glass Company, and American Window Glass Company. The United States Glass Company consisted of 16 tableware companies by 1893. The National Glass Company controlled 19 glass companies, which meant it controlled about 75 percent of the glass tableware market in the United States. The American Window Glass Company trust was created in 1898, and it had over half of the nation's window glassmaking capacity in part because it consisted of many of the large works that used tank furnaces.\n\n\n=== 1899 summary ===\nIn 1899 the United States had 355 glass works and 55,256 employees. Leading states based on total production value  were Pennsylvania (39%), Indiana (26%), New Jersey (9%) and Ohio (8%). Based on the value of production of building glass (window, plate, and wire glass), Pennsylvania had the highest output in the nation. Indiana was second in this category, and its production was more than double all the other states (not including Pennsylvania) combined. Pennsylvania was the leader in pressed and blown glass, followed by Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, and New York. The leader for bottles and jars was Indiana, followed by New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bottles and jars accounted for 38 percent of all glass made during the year, based on value. Pressed and blown glass, and building glass, each accounted for 30 percent of glass manufactured. (Rounding and an \"all other\" category account for the remaining two percentage points.) About two thirds of building glass was window glass.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

The municipality is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite Cotabato being part of Soccsksargen.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Bangsamoro was created in 2019 to supplant the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 63 barangays in the province of Cotabato were grouped with the newer autonomous region in the second part of the plebiscite held in February 6. The mother municipalities and Cotabato province remained part of Soccsksargen.By March 2020, these barangays were designated as a Special Geographic Area (SGA) of the Bangsamoro region.On August 17, 2023, the bills consolidating the SGA barangays into eight municipalities were approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament, The particular bill creating Kadayangan was Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 130.A plebiscite was held on April 13, 2024, and voters approved all eight bills reconstituting the SGA barangays to eight municipalities including Kadayangan, where 6,292 voted in favor of its creation while 80 voted against. The Bangsamoro regional government will provide P2.5 million in funding for the municipal government until it gets its share of income from the National Tax Allotment. Kadayangan was created from seven barangays of Midsayap.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Barangays ===\nKadayangan is politically subdivided into seven barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks  while some have sitios.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Government ==\nOfficers-in-charge will be selected by BARMM Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim to fill positions in the municipal government pending regular elections in 2025. The municipality will also stay under the jurisdiction of the Special Geographic Area pending the creation of a new province.\n\n\n== References ==",

She won the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies in 2023.\nShe was named after Ascoli Piceno, a city in Italy. She was awarded the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Filly for 2023.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old season ===\nAscoli Piceno debuted at the Tokyo Racecourse on June 24, 2023, in a two-year-old newcomer race on turf at the distance of 1,400m. She was ridden by Christophe Lemaire, who let her settle at the back of the pack, then took the lead on the final straight, winning by two-and-a-half lengths. Two months later, on August 27, she raced in the Niigata Nisai Stakes for her first graded stakes race challenge. Ridden by Hiroshi Kitamura, she settled in the middle of the pack. On the final straight, she chased down the runaway horse Shonan Manuela and won by a length, successfully achieving her first graded stakes win.\nFor the last race of her two-year-old season, she was signed-up for the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies held at Hanshin Racecourse on December 10. This was her first grade-one stakes race. Ridden by Hiroshi Kitamura again, she settled in midfield. Entering the final straight, after passing a group of horses, she overtook Corazon Beat in the final furlong and held off the fast-finishing Stellenbosch, winning the race by a neck. She achieved her first grade-one stakes victory while breaking the race record.\n\n\n== Racing statistics ==\nBelow data is based on data available on JBIS Search, and NetKeiba.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\nHer grand dam from the damside won the Fillies' Mile in 2007.\nHer dam's sister Touching Speech won the Rose Stakes in 2015.\nOther close relatives include Henrythenavigator, who won four group-one races including the 2008 2000 Guineas Stakes; Magician, winner of the 2013 Irish 2,000 Guineas and Breeders' Cup Turf; and Fashionista, winner of the 2020 JBC Ladies' Classic.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Susana de Noronha is a Portuguese anthropologist, PhD in sociology, and researcher at the Center for Social Studies (CES) at the University of Coimbra. In addition to her research, she works as an invited assistant professor at the Department of Sociology of the Institute of Social Sciences (ICS) at the University of Minho.She is a founding member of AIDA - Social Sciences Research Network on Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Algorithms. Additionally, she holds the position of Portuguese ambassador for The Association for the Study of Death and Society, based in the United Kingdom. Previously, she held the position of coordinator of the Center for Studies on Science, Economy, and Society (NECES-CES) and was a member of the Permanent Committee of the Scientific Council of CES (from 2020 to January 2022).Concentrating at the crossroads of art, science, and technology studies, she has been exploring medical anthropology and anthropology of art and material culture. Her work, which is qualitative and interdisciplinary in nature, centers on experiences, narratives, and technologies related to health and illness, along with other material aspects. Presently, she is intrigued by collaborations among science, art, and communities, investigating the impact of artificial intelligence on the narratives we construct and the realities we shape. Besides her academic pursuits, she is also an illustrator, a practice that influences her academic work. Additionally, she is a poet and lyricist, with work published in three albums, one EP, and four compilations of Portuguese music.\n\n\n== Contributions and research ==\nAuthor of three research monographs, book chapters, and scientific articles, exploring representations of illness, technologies, and biomedical materialities in visual arts, she pioneered the study of art and material culture of oncological illness in Portugal, her field of work since 2005. Recognized for her dozens of published scientific illustrations, she is responsible for introducing a new methodology called creative ethnographic drawing, revitalizing this practice through the use of metaphor and imagination, expanding the forms of production within the social sciences. Her work has already earned her several invitations to universities and appearances in the national media.\n\n\n=== Published work ===\n\n\n==== A Tinta, a Mariposa e a Metástase: a Arte como Experiência, Conhecimento e Ação sobre o Cancro de Mama ====\nIn her first work, published in 2009, the researcher analyzes and comments on 24 artistic projects produced by women, all related to the female experience of breast cancer. The author approaches art as an integral part of the lived experience of the disease, exploring how it shapes how cancer is experienced, understood, and faced. From diagnosis to surgical experiences, Noronha portrays how art is used as a tool of expression by women facing cancer. Through a variety of artistic forms, including photography, painting, drawing, sculpture, and collage, the author demonstrates how art can be a form of knowledge and intervention, both individually and collectively. By blending empirical, biomedical, and social knowledge, the artists redefine the experience of cancer as a socially constructed reality, beyond the traditional medical perspective.\n\n\n==== Objetos Feitos de Cancro - Mulheres, Cultura Material e Doença nas Estórias da Arte ====\nIn her second work, published in 2015, the author investigated the material culture of oncological illness, examining the materialities present in artistic projects created by or with women who have experienced cancer. The author explores how hospital, household, and personal objects intertwine with different stages of the disease, from diagnosis to death. By considering a wide range of artistic forms, including photography, painting, drawing, collage, modeling, sculpture, and sewing, Noronha illustrates how illness manifests as a modular experience, while objects exist and act as embeddable realities within that context. This theoretical and methodological approach continues to depict the intersection between art, illness, and material culture.\n\n\n==== Cancro Sobre Papel: estórias de oito mulheres portuguesas entre palavra falada, arte e ciência escrita ====\nIn the final piece of her trilogy, published in 2019, Susana de Noronha gathers experiences and stories from eight Portuguese women with cancer, utilizing a qualitative, intersubjective, and transdisciplinary approach. Integrating knowledge of the body, spoken word, creative writing, photography, drawing, and painting, this project seeks an ontological, epistemological, and performative understanding of art as an integral part of the cancer experience. The researcher reflects on the elements that shape women's experiences, combining text and image to create an illustrated social science that enhances the impact and public outcomes of the research.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nSusana de Noronha's artistic journey began in childhood, where drawing people, objects, and events became an integral part of her life. Throughout adolescence, as a student of art and design, her sketchbooks were filled with intricate representations of eyes, faces, hands, and trees, each serving as central themes reflecting her evolving artistic style. Drawing essentially became a defining aspect of her identity and potential. Transitioning into her career as an anthropologist, Susana de Noronha integrated her creative skills into her academic pursuits, reshaping traditional notions of social sciences, scientific illustration, and ethnographic drawing. Far from being just a complement to her professional activities, art formed the foundation of her research methodology. Although she may not identify as an artist in the traditional sense, she sees herself as a social scientist who uses art as a means to both understand and engage with her subjects of study. In her academic work, Susana de Noronha has produced a diverse variety of illustrations, each one imbued with metaphor and imagination, enriching the discourse within her field. These illustrations serve as visual narratives, complementing and enhancing the written content of essays, articles, and book chapters. In her artistic career, she has also produced poems and lyrics, writing various songs for the projects At Freddy’s House and Pyroscaphe.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNORONHA, Susana de – A tinta, a mariposa e a metástase: a arte como experiência, conhecimento e acção sobre o cancro da mama.

        "content": "\"Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Smackdown – Reunited\" is the fifteenth episode of the sixteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. It originally aired on April 12, 2024. The episode saw the returns of the season's eliminated contestants, who competed for a prize of $50,000. Morphine Love Dion won the contest.\n\n\n== Episode ==\nThe current and eliminated contestants reunite in the Werk Room. On the main stage, RuPaul welcomes fellow judges Michelle Visage and Ts Madison. The eliminated participate in a series of lip-syncs called the Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Smackdown, the winner of which will be crowned as \"Queen of She Done Already Done Had Herses\" with a $50,000 prize. For most of the lip-syncs a contestant is chosen at random, who gets to select their opponent. Their opponent then gets to choose the lip-sync song.\nFirst, Dawn chooses to lip-sync against Amanda Tori Meating, who chooses \"Damaged\" (2008) by Danity Kane. Amanda Tori Meating wins the lip-sync and advances to round 2. In the second lip-sync, Q chooses Megami as her opponent, who chooses \"What About\" by Janet Jackson. Megami wins and advances to round 2. In the third lip-sync, Morphine Love Dion chooses Geneva Karr as her opponent, who chooses \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2022) by Ava Max. Morphine Love Dion wins and advances to round 2. In the fourth lip-sync, Mirage chooses Hershii LiqCour-Jeté as her opponent, who chooses \"Alone 2.0\" (2023) by Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj. Mirage wins and advances to round 2. As the last three remaining contestants, Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige, Plasma, and Xunami Muse must face off in a lip-sync. Mh'iya Iman Le'Paige is randomly selected to pick the song and chooses \"Milkshake\" (2003) by Kelis. Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige wins and advances directly to round 3.\nIn the first lip-sync of round 2, Amanda Tori Meating chooses Megami as her opponent, who chooses \"The Shoop Shoop Song\" by Cher. Megami wins and advances to round 3. In the second lip-sync of round 2, the two remaining contestants, Mirage and Morphine Love Dion, must lip-sync. Morphine Love Dion is randomly selected to pick the song and chooses \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" (1989) by Donna Summer. Morphine Love Dion wins and advances to round 3. Before the third round, RuPaul reveals a twist: one of the remaining contestants will be selected at random and she must choose her opponent. The contestant who is not chosen will advance directly to the final round. Megami is selected, and she chooses to lip-sync against Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige. The two face off in a lip-sync to the remaining song \"We Got the Beat\" (1982) by The Go-Go's. Megami wins and advances to the final round. In the final round Megami and Morphine Love Dion lip-sync to \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" by C+C Music Factory. Morphine Love Dion wins.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode originally aired on April 12, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

By 1999, Estrada was a captain of the Philippine Air Force.After his father was deposed from the presidency by EDSA II in January 2001 and replaced by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Jude clarified that his allegiance as a reserve captain of the Philippine Air Force would now shift away from his father and to Arroyo, stating that \"as a soldier, I am loyal to the commander-in-chief, no matter who they are.\" Despite this, after the Sandiganbayan arrested both his father and brother Jinggoy Estrada on April 25 for plunder, Jude participated in the pro-Estrada demonstrations at EDSA Shrine that protested the arrest. The rallies he attended were soon followed by the May 1 riots initiated by rallyists marching from the shrine to Malacañang Palace, which he and his half-brother JV Ejercito joined but left before the march reached Mendiola Street near the palace.On June 2, 2008, Estrada married his childhood neighbor and long-time girlfriend Maria Rowena \"Weng\" Ocampo in Forbes Park, Makati.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJude Estrada at IMDb",

It was state champion in men's football and is one of the traditional clubs in Bahia's tennis competitions.\nIt was founded on October 4, 1914, on Avenida Sete de Setembro, then Rua São Pedro, in the center of Salvador. That same year, the Yankee Foot-Ball Club and several other football clubs were also founded in the city as a result of a match played at Campo da Pólvora between Esporte Clube Ypiranga and a team from the Brazilian Navy training ship Benjamim Constant. Although the main focus was on football, from the beginning it was established as a sports club for various sports.\nIn men's football, AAB was champion of the Campeonato Baiano in 1924 and the Torneio Início da Bahia in 1928. He was also runner-up in Bahia four times (1921, 1922, 1923 and 1925). However, in 1930 its football department closed. The same had happened with Bahiano de Tênis and footballers previously linked to both gave rise to Esporte Clube Bahia the following year.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n=== State titles ===\nCampeonato Baiano: 1924\nTorneio Início da Bahia: 1928\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hard Times in the Land of Plenty is an album by the American band Omar & the Howlers, released in 1987. It was their first album for major label. The title track peaked at No. 19 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and appeared in the film Like Father Like Son. The band supported the album with a North American tour. Hard Times in the Land of Plenty was sometimes included with \"heartland rock\" albums of the 1980s that addressed worsening economic conditions in the United States.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Richard Mullen. It was recorded by the band as a power trio, with the Howlers adding a keyboardist prior to touring. Unlike many blues rock players of the time, frontman Omar Dykes preferred power chords over one-note guitar solos. His primary vocal influence was Howlin' Wolf. The title track bemoans the rise of poverty in the United States during the 1980s.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Houston Chronicle praised Omar's \"often fanciful and reverberating guitar chops and his always sly and dangerous vocals, which alternate between a smokey hoarseness and a Howlin' Wolf-styled lowdown growl.\" The Sun-Sentinel concluded that, \"despite the rather monotonous stylings of the 10 original songs, Omar's silty, root-bound rasp overcomes the flaws and makes this one of the better party albums to appear in awhile.\" The Vancouver Sun noted that \"they all look like bikers, and sound like it as well, rolling out savage roadhouse R&B and swamp boogie that'll be roarin' from car stereos for years to come.\"\nThe Boston Globe opined that the band \"are true songwriters, not just boogie merchants along the lines of Southern rock oldsters like Molly Hatchet or Wet Willie.\" The Toronto Star deemed the album \"non-nonsense, thoughtful, intelligent yet fiery rock 'n' roll.\" The Windsor Star said that \"Omar's voice could prepare car bodies for the primer coat, and the shuffle never quits.\" USA Today listed Hard Times in the Land of Plenty among the best pop albums of 1987.\nAllMusic called the album \"a rough and tumble collection that is driven as much by fine original songwriting as it is by the band's edgy sound.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Republic (Croatian: Republika), formally Res Publica (Latin: lit. 'public affair') in English, is a centrist political party in Croatia. The party's founder and current president is Damir Vanđelić.\nIt ran in the 2024 parliamentary election in a coalition with Focus.\n\n\n== Name and symbol ==\nThe party's name was inspired by Dubrovnik's Republic of Ragusa. By its statut, the party's international name is Res Publica (Latin: public affair).\nThe party's symbol is a golden marten, the national animal of Croatia.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 2 December 2023, the party was founded and introduced to the public by its leader Damir Vanđelić, ahead of the parliamentary election of the upcoming year. Vanđelić, a former head of the INA supervisory board and director of the Reconstruction Fund, was previously in negotiations with Croatian Democratic Union to be their candidate for Mayor of Zagreb in the 2021 Zagreb local elections, but he refused.\nThe party members are described as people successful in their fields, most of whom haven't been politically active before. The six vice presidents elected at the founding convention included Vesna Škare-Ožbolt, former Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Ivo Sanader (2003–2006), Gordana Deranja, former head of Croatian Employers Association, and Dario Marenić, former deputy leader of Croatian Party of Rights — Dr. Ante Starčević.\nOn 17 January 2024, Škare-Ožbolt left the party as it \"violated her integrity\".\nThe party announced a coalition with a liberal party Focus for the parliamentary election. The coalition, with Vanđelić as the candidate for Prime Minister, is focused on lowering taxes, implementing reforms and fighting corruption. Republic failed to enter Sabor.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nVanđelić described the party's ideology as \"widely centrist\", with elements of social policies and \"strategies that would usually be attributed to the so-called centre-right\". When asked about abortion on N1, he gave a controversial statement for saying that, while the final decision is on the woman, \"a woman's greatest urge is to bear (a baby)\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Florin Mihail Filipoiu (born January 15, 1958) is a Romanian physician and academic, known for his role in the Romanian Revolution.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nFilipoiu was born on January 15, 1958. He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the Carol Davila University in 1984, specializing in radiology.\nHe received his doctorate in 2000 and, since 2013, he is a full professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Carol Davila University, as well as the head of the Anatomy Department of the Faculty. He is also the prodean of the Faculty.\n\n\n== Role in the Romanian Revolution ==\nOn the morning of December 21, 1989, Florin Filipoiu was driving his car on the road from Târgoviște, where he worked at the Municipal Hospital, to Bucharest, where he was a trainer at the Department of Anatomy of the Faculty of Medicine, he listened to the radio speech of Nicolae Ceaușescu. He arrived in Bucharest at noon and stopped at the Roman Square, where the first group of anti-Ceausescu demonstrators formed. There were about 15 students and one worker from the 23 August Factory. Filipoiu joined them. When the night came, the communist regime's law enforcement began firing weapons at protesters. The protesters managed to barricade themselves in front of the InterContinental Hotel, from which they had to flee. Many were shot, clubbed to death, stabbed and crushed by armoured vehicles, but Filipoiu survived, and managed to escape to his apartment. Arriving home, he took the phone book and started calling people from all counties to tell them that the revolution had begun. \nOn December 22, after the revolutionaries took control of TVR, Filipoiu gave a speech in which he called for, among other things, the abolition of the cult of personality, the release of political prisoners, free elections and free press. \nIn an interview for Adevarul in 2010, Filipoiu said that Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front \"confiscated\" the revolution to take power.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn July 2017, several professors at the Carol Davila University were accused of bribery. He was acquitted in August the same year. While Filipoiu was investigated, journalist Dorin Chioțea, who is a physician by training and who was also Filipoiu's student, published an article defending Filipoiu.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abu Bakar Hamzah is a Malaysian politician who has served as Member of the Perlis State Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Kuala Perlis since November 2022. He is a member of the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU), a component party of the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition. He is State Deputy Chairman I of PN of Perlis, State Chairman of BERSATU of Perlis and Division Chief of BERSATU of Kangar.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Member of the Perlis State Legislative Assembly (since 2022) ===\n\n\n==== 2022 Perlis state election ====\nIn the 2022 Perlis state election, Abu Bakar made his electoral debut after being nominated by PN to contest for the Kuala Perlis state seat. He won the seat and was elected into the Perlis State Legislative Assembly as the Kuala Perlis MLA after narrowly defeating defending MLA Nor Azam Karap of Pakatan Harapan (PH), independent candidate Azahar Ahmad, Kamarudin Malek of Barisan Nasional (BN) and Muhamad Hairi Noordin of the Heritage Party (WARISAN) by the majority of only 154 votes.\n\n\n== Controversies and issues ==\n\n\n=== Claims of the Perlis Malaysian Islamic Party turmoil ===\nOn 27 October 2023, Abu Bakar claimed that Perlis Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) led by Menteri Besar of Perlis Mohd Shukri Ramli as the State Commissioner was in the midst of internal turmoil, infighting and row over a number of issues related to religious understanding and governance. He said the situation in Perlis PAS has resulted in uneasiness among Perlis PN and the state administration. He later insisted that Perlis PAS must not hide its problems, divisions and tensions and called for clarification and intervention on its situation to quell the issues and build the strength of Perlis PN together. In reply to the claims, President of PAS Abdul Hadi Awang issued a stern warning against any acts of sabotage that could lead to the collapse of the any PN state administrations. \n\n\n=== Dissatisfaction of not being appointed as Member of the Perlis State Executive Council ===\nOn 16 November 2023, the Perlis State Executive Council (EXCO) was reshuffled by Menteri Besar Mohd Shukri. Three MLAs of BERSATU, Titi Tinggi MLA Izizam Ibrahim, Pauh MLA Megat Hashirat Hassan were reappointed and Tambun Tulang MLA Wan Zikri Afthar Ishak was appointed as Perlis EXCO Members while Abu Bakar as the Perlis PN Deputy Chairman I, Perlis BERSATU Chairman and Kuala Perlis MLA was not appointed as Perlis EXCO Member. He expressed his regret and disappointment at Mohd Shukri for not appointing him to the position despite being asked and urged by Chairman of PN and President of BERSATU Muhyiddin Yassin who nominated, proposed and supported Abu Bakar to become Perlis EXCO Member, to do so, describing it as an act of disregard, disrespect and betrayal against Muhyiddin. He stressed that this is the second time he was not appointed, the first time was when the Perlis PN state administration was first formed in November 2022. He also alleged Izizam and Megat Hashirat for 'stabbing his back' and 'masterminding a scheme' in effort to prevent Mohd Shukri from appointing him. In addition, he added that Mohd Shukri should have discussed the appointments of Perlis EXCO Members with him in the Perlis PN state leadership, which its meeting has never been called since the 2022 state election. Therefore, he declared 'war' on Mohd Shukri and demanded him to step down as the Menteri Besar. In response to the declaration, Izizam, also the Perlis BERSATU Deputy Chairman, asked his State Chairman Abu Bakar not to overreact but to discuss with the PN state leadership first before making any remarks. In addition, he advised Abu Bakar to be patient and focus on helping the public. He said Abu Bakar appeared to be wanting to fight everyone. He also denied the allegations that he had 'stabbed the back' of Abu Bakar, highlighting that he had no right to influence the decisions of Mohd Shukri who was older and more politically experienced than him as well as noting that sacrifices often needed to be made as some individuals would gain certain positions at the expense of others.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Evelyne Owona Essomba (born Evelyne Mengue Akoum, January 24, 1977) is a Cameroonian journalist. She graduated from the 26th class of the Advanced School of Mass Communication and worked for the newspaper Mutations before joining National Television CRTV, where she worked for 22 years.\nOn June 18, 2021, she became the first woman to lead the Cameroonian section of the International Francophone Press Union (UPF).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEvelyne Owona Essomba was born on January 24, 1977, in a maternity hospital in Yaoundé. Her father is from Bafia and her mother is from Lékié, specifically Sa'a. She grew up in a modest family, being the third child and the first daughter among seven children. She attended primary school at the École publique groupe 2 in Dschang and later moved to Yaoundé, where she completed her primary education at the École publique du Camp Yeyap. She then pursued her secondary education at the Lycée Général Leclerc. After obtaining her high school diploma, she enrolled in the Bilingual Letters program at the University of Yaoundé I. In 1995, while in her second year at university, she took the entrance exam for the Advanced School of Mass Communication (ESSTIC), which she successfully passed, becoming a member of the 26th class of journalists from the school (1995–1998).\n\n\n== Career ==\nEvelyne graduated from ESSTIC in 1998 and began her professional career at the newspaper Mutations. She was responsible for the culture and communication page until then held by one Barbara Etoa. In 1999, the then Director-General of CRTV, Gervais Mendozé, launched a recruitment drive called the 15 because 15 journalists were called upon to revitalize the newsroom. Evelyne Owona was among them. She hosted numerous TV shows such as: Special Evenings, Book of the Week.... In 2003, shortly after getting married, she decided to join her husband in Douala, where she worked for 6 years at the CRTV regional station of Littoral.\nIn 2009, her husband was transferred to Maroua. Once again, she requested a transfer to CRTV Extreme North, the regional station in the Extreme North region of Cameroon. She stayed there for 2 years before returning to Yaoundé in 2011, this time to settle down. Her motivations were simple: there was a call from the management soliciting her expertise regarding the wave of program restructuring at the central station.\nLater, her talents were utilized; she became a news anchor: the 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 6:00 PM news, which she hosted for 1 year. Then she presented the weekend news for 6 months. Finally, she was promoted to the prime-time news.\nOn January 30, 2021, after 22 years at National Television, Evelyne Owona Essomba was appointed Head of Channel Crtv News for the new 24-hour news channel of CRTV · .\nA member of the International Francophone Press Union (UPF) for 23 years, Evelyne Owona Essomba became, on June 18, 2021, the first woman president of the Cameroonian section of UPF Cameroon for a 4-year term. She obtained 61 votes out of 63 voters. Formerly Secretary-General and then vice-president, she replaced Aimé Robert Bihina, who had been president since 2012.\nOn Thursday, May 5, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. at ESSEC Douala, Evelyne Owona defended her PhD thesis in Information and Communication Sciences (SIC) in the presence of the Director-General of CRTV, Charles Ndongo. · \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gracixalus guangdongensis, the Guangdong tree frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae.  It is endemic to China, where it has been observed in Guangdong Province and Hunan Province.\nThe adult male frog measures 26.1-34.7 mm in snout-vent length and the adult female frog is 34.9-35.4 mm. The webbed skin is more developed on the back feet than on the front feet. The skin of the dorsum is brown or beige in color with a darker mark in the shape of the letter Y on the back. The male frog has a visible vocal sac.\nThis frog lives in bamboo forests on hills with evergreen and broadleaf trees. It has been observed between 600 and 1600 meters above sea level. The eggs and embryos have been observed in water in bamboo plants.\nScientists classify this frog as at least concern of extinction. Its range includes some protected parks: Dawuling Nature Reserve, Mangshan Nature Reserve, Nanling Nature Reserve, and Mount Nankun Nature Reserve. However, scientists do not believe the frog lives extensively in between the areas where it has been sighted because other frogs in Gracixalus occupy those niches.  This frog still faces some threat associated with habitat loss: Human being cut down trees to collect wood and build farms. Tourists can disturb this frog.\n\n\n== References ==",

His debut film, Hit the Road, premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, and was named Best Film at the 2021 BFI London Film Festival.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPanahi was born in Tehran, Iran, to Jafar Panahi, a film director associated with the Iranian New Wave movement, and Tahereh Saidi, a nurse. He has a younger sister, Solnaz. Panahi studied at the University of Tehran. As of 2022, he continues to reside in Tehran.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGrowing up, Panahai worked as an assistant on several times directed by his father, and also observed his father's collaborators, including Abbas Kiarostami. In 2009, while still a student at the University of Tehran, Panahi's short film The First Film was screened at the Montreal World Film Festival in Montreal, Canada.\nPanahi edited his father's film 3 Faces, which competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.\nPanahi's directorial debut, Hit the Road, was filmed in 2019 and follows a family travelling to a border in north-western Iran in order to smuggle their eldest son out of the country. Panahi stated his emotional inspiration for the film was the last day he spent with his sister Solnaz before she left Iran due to threats being made against her. Panahi provided a false script to Iranian authorities in order to make the film within the country. Hit the Road premiered during Director's Fortnight at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and subsequently was screened at other European film festivals including the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic and the BFI London Film Festival in the United Kingdom. At the latter, it was given the Best Film award, with competition president Małgorzata Szumowska describing it as \"a film that made us laugh and cry and feel alive\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This article presents the various figures present at the time of the siege and capture of Constantinople by the Ottomans on May 29, 1453. These include those mentioned in the 16th-century chronicle by Pseudo-Sphrantzes. The latter is supposedly inspired by Byzantine historian Georges Sphrantzès' notes on the siege. However, Sphrantzès' chronicle contains only vague, laconic passages about the fall of Constantinople, which he actually witnessed.\n\n\n== Besieged ==\nConstantine XI Palaeologus (February 8, 1404 - May 29, 1453): the last Byzantine emperor, he led the 7,000 defenders of Constantinople and perished during the final assault and capture of the city by the Ottomans on May 29, 1453.\nLucas Notaras (? - June 3, 1453): archduke and the empire's most important figure after Constantine XI, he led a reserve corps near the land walls. Initially spared by Mehmed II, he was executed a few days later along with two of his sons. The third, named Jacob, was incorporated into the sultan's harem, later taking refuge in Italy around 1471.\nGeorges Sphrantzès: historian, friend and advisor to Constantine XI, he was present in Constantinople at the time of the siege. He carried out various missions, but does not appear to have taken part in the fighting. He was captured and released by Mehmed II after the city was taken.\nDémétrius Paléologue Métochitès (? - May 29, 1453): last governor of Constantinople, he perished with his sons on the last day of the fighting, along with many other Byzantine dignitaries.\nTheophilus Palaeologus: cousin of the emperor, he is best known for launching a desperate charge when the Byzantine defenses collapsed. He perished in the process.\n\n\n== Assiegers ==\nMehmed II: Ottoman sultan at the time of the siege. He led the Turkish army.\nSuleïman Baltoglu: an Ottoman admiral of Bulgarian origin, he led the Ottoman fleet of 120 to 130 small ships known as Hadirika, in contrast to the much larger, faster and more robust Genoese galleons. However, his inability to prevent this fleet of four Christian ships from reaching the besieged led to his dismissal.\nHamza Bey: replaces Baltoglu at the head of the Ottoman fleet after April 20.\nZagan Pacha: an Ottoman general, he led the troops positioned opposite the Genoese colony of Péra and the ramparts of the Golden Horn.\nHalil Pasha: Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, he opposed Mehmed II's policies and tried to persuade him to lift the siege. He was executed shortly after the fall of Constantinople for his attitude.\nKaradja Pacha: led the Ottoman troops in Europe.\nIshak Pacha: led the Ottoman troops in Anatolia.\nAkh Shemseddin: religious leader on the Ottoman side. Following the battle of April 20, when four Christian ships succeeded in forcing the Ottoman blockade, Akh Shemseddin sent a letter to Mehmed II criticizing the Sultan's strategy and asking him to punish those responsible, including Suleiman Baltoglu.\nConstantin d'Ostrovica or Michel Constantinovitch d'Ostrovica: a member of the Serbian contingent in the Ottoman army sent by Georges Brankovic, he later joined the Janissary corps before becoming a Christian again. It was during this period that he wrote his biography Memoirs of a Janissary, part of which is dedicated to the capture of Constantinople.",

The film tells the story about the enquiries in the aftermath of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Shot entirely in Pittsburgh, the film stars Cotter Smith, Fiona Dourif, Jayne Wisener, and Karen Allen.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter the RMS Carpathia arrives in New York City with the Titanic survivors, Senator William Alden Smith (Cotter Smith) has assembled in New York to guarantee the testimony of all fundamental witnesses during the sinking. Senator Smith and journalist Alaine Ricard (Fiona Dourif) investigate the tragedy as they decipher tales of hurried investigations, political intervention, and the pursuit of corporate responsibility, in addition to flashbacks to the gallantry and sacrifice on Titanic's deck during the fateful night in April 1912.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCotter Smith as William Alden Smith, a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator investigating the sinking of the RMS Titanic.\nJayne Wisener as Maggie Malloy, Senator Smith's secretary.\nFiona Dourif as Alaine Ricard, an investigative journalist operating under a pseudonym who investigating the inquiries.\nKaren Allen as Nancy Smith, William Smith's wife.\n\n\n== Release ==\nUnsinkable was limited theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on 12 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nJoshua Axelrod from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave it a 3 out of 4, stating the film \"is an extremely commendable and well-intentioned project that’s only held back by an occasionally stodgy disposition and the rare moments when the film's seams peak through its otherwise glossy exterior.\" Monique Jones from Common Sense Media also gave it a positive rating, saying, \"This straightforward drama is likely to entertain history buffs, especially those who've been entranced by the lore around the Titanic.\"\nLeslie Felperin, a writer for The Guardian, gave this film 2 stars out of 5, stating \"the film-makers must have been grateful that the tragedy happened in the dark because it covers up the fact that it looks like the lifeboats are being lowered into a swimming pool while a giant cutout ship capsizes in the background\". Although she praised the dialogue, saying it \"sounds as if it was lifted straight from the congressional record, which is curiously pleasing to the ear and adds a tang of authenticity.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films about the Titanic\nBritish Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nUnsinkable at AllMovie\nUnsinkable at Rotten Tomatoes\nUnsinkable at IMDb",

        "content": "ARISE Adelante is a nonprofit serving immigrant women and children in unincorporated colonias (very low-income, informal communities) in South Texas. ARISE stands for A Resource In Serving Equality. It was founded by Roman Catholic sister Gerrie Naughton in 1987 in conjunction with women from the local community. ARISE assists new members for a while, but then they must agree to volunteer back to the community, working in a distributive leadership model. Its motto, from its founder, is \"ARISE does not do for the people what the people can do for themselves.\" It is cosponsored by the Sisters of Charity and the Sisters of Mercy of the Incarnate Word.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe US Conference of Catholic Bishops through the Catholic Campaign for Human Development recognized ARISE as serving over 5,000 women and children at any given time, \"helping the people of the Rio Grande Valley participate in processes that promote their rights and dignity as human beings.\" In 2015 the Building Community Workshop of Dallas, a secular organization, added founder Gerrie Naughton to a set of trading cards it prints to honor \"heroes of the Rio Grande Valley.\" ARISE gives the Gerrie Naughton Award annually in her honor. In 2024 MacKenzie Scott's foundation granted ARISE $2 million, the largest gift in its history.\nThe Rio Grande Guardian did a five-part series on her, ARISE, and the work of its all-woman team. ARISE was featured on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper in 2023. In 2020 Glamour magazine profiled ARISE. It is the subject of a colonias project at Southwest Texas State University, which today is Texas State University.\nSister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, who in 2020 was in the TIME 100, works closely with ARISE. Every week ARISE volunteers from the colonias go to the Catholic Charities Respite Center and assist migrants with their visas. The center helps them get safely to sponsoring families and organizations.\nARISE is regularly featured or mentioned in many English- and Spanish-language newspapers in and around the Rio Grande Valley. Examples include the Rio Grande Guardian (multiple features), El Paso Times (multiple features), and ValleyCentral.com. ARISE has been in the Catholic media, including Global Sisters Report, Our Sunday Visitor, and the Sacred Heart publications King Street Chronicle and Sacred Heart Greenwich. ARISE has als been featured on the popular podcast \"A Nun's Life.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Harry Trevlin Fultz (29 December 1888, Salem, Indiana – 30 December 1980, Seymour, Indiana) was an American teacher who contributed to the development of education in Albania in the period between the two world wars.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarry Fultz was born on December 29, 1888, in Salem, Indiana, United States of America. First, he graduated from Wabash College in Indiana, and then continued his studies at Amarou Technological University in the field of mechanics. Until 1922, he worked as a lecturer in several educational institutions in America. During this period, he also served in the army for a short time (1917–1919).In 1922, the American Red Cross appointed Harry T. Fultz as the professor of mechanical arts and Director of the Technical School in Tirana. The Technical School, through his work, attracted the attention of the opinions of the time as a school of high quality. He took the first steps of pragmatist pedagogy in Albania according to the \"laboratory school\" model and the pedagogical principle \"Learning by doing\", which he was the first to implement. He brought to Albania the tradition of the best American school experience, implemented new teaching and learning methods, and implemented dozens of projects for the preparation and formation of new technicians.Harry T. Fultz was an outstanding teacher, known for his scientific and special organizational skills. He left a deep impact on Albanian education and became a model for future generations. His mission ended in 1933, but the message he left behind was: \"Try to make the country worth living in!\"During World War II, he worked for 4 years at the State Department and other US government agencies. From May 1945 to November 1946, he worked at the US diplomatic mission in Tirana and at the American embassy in Rome until the spring of 1947.In the spring of 1947, he was appointed Director of the International Center, a residence primarily for foreign students at the University of Chicago, and remained in this post until his retirement in 1962. During those years, he also served as secretary of the Pan American Board of Education (1947 – 1962).\n\n\n== Lines to Illyria ==\nIn his poetic work \"Lines to Illyria\" written with his daughter Joana Fultz Kontos during their stay in Tirana, in 1946, but published in 1950 in New York, Fultz recorded his memories by dedicating some poems to Illyria. According to Professor Zef Nekaj, beyond poetic taste, Fultz portrays the antiquity and ruggedness of the land that inspires him. The evaluation of the poetic work \"Lines to Illyria\", suggests that Fultz devoted over a decade of effort and momentum to Albania. He expresses his anxiety about the situation of the Albanians at that time, their achievements and failures, and the noble complaint of a progressive man's fiery heart, eager to do as much as possible for the Albanian people.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHarry Fultz Institute\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Catherine \"Gerrie\" Naughton (1942–2009) was a Roman Catholic nun of the Sisters of Mercy (RSM). In 1987 she founded ARISE Adelante to serve those living in the unincorporated colonias (low-income, informal communities sometimes called slums) of the Rio Grande Valley. Members of ARISE receive assistance for a period of time but then must volunteer back to the community in a distributive leadership model. Naughton's motto was \"ARISE does not do for the people what the people can do for themselves.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nShe was born in 1942 in County Roscommon, Ireland. Her parents were Mary Fallon Naughton and Patrick Naughton. She decided to immigrate to the United States when a priest from visited her high school to talk about the need for missionaries in Mississippi. She came to the United States at age 17 in 1959, giving her address as the Convent of Mercy in St. Louis, Missouri. She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics.\n\n\n== Work as a teacher in Louisiana and Mississippi ==\nBetween 1960 and 1978 she taught high school sciene and math in Louisiana and Mississippi. From 1978 to 1983 she worked in Meridian, Mississippi as Director of Religious Education at Saint Patrick's Catholic Church, but left to seek more direct outreach. She moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi in August 1983 to work at Sacred Heart Catholic Church as a pastoral assistant for Monsignor John Scanlon, making 20 home visits a week to work her way through a roster of 800 families, thus receiving important preparation for her future career-defining work in Texas. She was known for casual dress, an informal style, and a keen interest in meeting people in their homes and learning about their needs. She was also a competitive runner, participating in the Crescent City Classic in New Orleans, and the Coca-Cola Classic in Hattiesburg, both in 1984, finishing second in the latter. She was the Red Carpet Run female master's champion in 1984.\n\n\n== Texas and ARISE ==\nIn the 1980s the Sisters of Mercy asked their communities to prepare for Hispanic ministries, so she studied Spanish at the Mexican American Cultural Center in San Antonio for a year. In 1987 she moved to the Rio Grande Valley, where sisters from her congregation had served for over a century. She chose Las Milpas, a rural area of about 12,000 people in the town of Pharr, Texas. Its name means \"the cornfields\" in Spanish. She and Ramona Casas met regularly at Casas's home for prayer, and formed a group. Casas, today a senior leader at ARISE, described Naughton's distinctive style of going door to door on her bicycle in the colonias as she had back in Mississippi, this time on a bicycle. Casas told The Monitor, \"The first time I met her, I remember thinking, `What is this nun doing on a bicycle?' It was the first time I had ever seen a nun not wearing a habit. After that, I thought all nuns in the United States wore shorts and used bicycles.\"\nAfter four years of offering English classes to over 450 people seeking amnesty under the Regan Administration's Immigration and Reform Act, in 1991 Naughton, Casas, and their team sought funding from city commissioners for a center, which they granted by giving her a five-year lease for inexpensive property owned by the city. Gradually more money came in from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, the Scanlon Foundation, and other sources, and the program began receiving VISTA volunteers. Executive Director Lourdes Flores immigrated from Mexico at age 12, and was hired at ARISE out of high school, initially teaching English to women in the colonias.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nNaughton was emphatic that the women of ARISE deserved recognition, and that they should be credited directly rather than giving sole credit to her or to the major organizations that supported them. However, she did receive recognition, and the executive director says that Naughton was the founder. In 1995 at the age of 53 Naughton won the Regina Cunningham Award from Mercy Action, Inc., the highest honor of the Sisters of Mercy. In 2015 a secular group, the Building Community Workshop of Dallas, added her to its roster of trading cards honoring heroes of the Rio Grande Valley. ARISE gives the Gerrie Naughton Award annually in her honor.\n\n\n== References ==",

The group committed 28 arson attacks in 2019. They burnt cars, boats, yachts, offices, and homes. They have no ideology or structure and are a plain \"revenge\" group. They also burnt military bases of Turkish troops stationed in northern Syria. The group claims that they do not target ordinary Turkish civilians, but only Turkish governmental buildings, and people they accuse of persecuting Kurds, such as AKP or MHP politicians, offices, and supporters. \nThe fires in Hatay in October 2020 were attributed to the group, and it was when they were recognised in the media. Turkish sources that it is a PKK proxy group, although it denies those claims and the PKK denied them too.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abu al-Barakat Munir Lahori (Persian: ابوالبرکات منیر لاہوری, romanized: Abū'l-Barakāt Munīr Lāhawrī) commonly known as Mollā Monīr Lāhūrī (1610 – 1644) was a Punjabi poet and prose writer of the Persian language active during the reign of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBorn on 28 November 1610 in a Punjabi family, Munīr was a native of Lahore. His father, ʿAbd al-Jalīl Ḥāfiẓ Abū Isḥāq, was a master calligrapher employed by emperor Akbar. His two brothers, Abū l-Fayḍ (pen name Fayḍā \"Grace\") and Abū l-Fatḥ (pen name Ḍamīr \"Heart\") were also poets.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMunīr began his career as a poet at the age of fourteen. In 1635, he entered the service of Mīrzā Ṣafī Sayf Khān, governor of Akbarabad (Agra) and brother-in-law of the queen, Momtāz Maḥall. He accompanied Sayf Khān when the latter was appointed as governor of Bengal. After Sayf Khān's death in 1639, Munīr joined the court of Shāpūr Mīrzā Iʿtiqād Khān, the governor of Jaunpur but soon returned to Akbarabad, where he was admitted to the inner circles of the court poets. He spent his last years in Agra, where he died young on 9 September 1644 and was buried in Lahore.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\nRecognised as one of the three major poets of Lahore during the reign of Shah Jahān, Munīr was a prolific writer and claimed to have written over 100,000 verse couplets. His contemporaries such as Chandarbhān Brahman and Moḥammad Ṣāleḥ Kanbōh considered him as one of the most accomplished poets of their era. One of his better known mathnavīs is Maẓhar-i gul (\"The rose's manifestation\"), also called Maṯnawī dar ṣefat-e Bengāla, which was written in 1639 and describes the flora, fauna and climate of the Bengal region. It has been published several times since 1889. Collections of his letters were published as Inshā-yi Munīr (\"Brilliant compositions\") and Nawbāva (\"First-fruits\"). In his short work Kārnāma (\"Chronicle\"), written in 1640, he pointed out serious literary defects in the poetry of Mughal poets ʿOrfī, Ṭāleb Āmolī, Ẓohūrī and Ẓolālī, and defended Khorasani style of poetry over sabk-i hindī. This work began a literary debate in Mughal India and resulted in a refutation written by Indo-Persian poet Sirāj al-Dīn Ārzū under the title Sirāj-i munīr (“Shining lamp”). Munīr was a childhood friend of Lahore-based scholars Moḥammad Ṣāleḥ Kanbōh and ʿInayatullāh Kanbōh, and wrote introduction to the collected volumes of inshaʿ of both brothers. Much of his later works, both prose and poetry, are full of homesickness for Lahore, its gardens and literary places.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nSharma, Sunil (2009). \"Abū l-Barakāt Munīr Lāhawrī\".

        "content": "British Airtours Flight 101 was a package tour flight from Palma, Spain to Leeds, England, operated by British Airtours. The plane overran the runway, with only minor injuries suffered by the passengers and crew.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe aircraft was an 11-year old L-1011, model 385-1. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had flown 15,875 hours and was carrying 159,929 kg of weight. Despite the damage suffered during the landing, the aircraft returned to service several weeks after the accident. The flight was also carrying members of the York City and Lincoln City Football teams.\n\n\n== The crash ==\nThe flight left Palma de Mallorca Airport at 10:21 UTC, and contacted Leeds Bradford Airport's air traffic control at 12:16, while still around 15 nautical miles from the airport. Around this time, the air traffic control informed Flight 101 that the runway it was to land on, Runway 14, was wet from rainfall that had occurred earlier, but that the rain had stopped temporarily. The aircraft began its approach using radar surveillance, even though air traffic control had confirmed he could see the aircraft from 7 miles. This was likely due to the fact that none of the pilots on the aircraft had previously landed at Leeds Bradford Airport. The aircraft was then cleared to 2500 feet, and made the final turn to face Runway 14. The flaps were extended, the engine's output changed, but the auto-throttle was left on until the aircraft was 36 feet above the runway. After the Flight Engineer called '30 feet', the Captain firmly touched the plane down on the runway.\nThe aircraft had touched down around 500 metres down the runway, with 1419 metres of runway and overrun ahead of them. As they touched down, the spoilers on the aircraft opened, and the Co-Pilot selected 90% reverse thrust, a higher amount than normally required due to the wet runway. As the aircraft sped down the runway, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then, once the Captain could see the red runway end lights, he applied full brakes, and said \"Gosh, the red lights come quickly don't they.\". Despite his braking, he could not feel any deceleration, and so he pushed as hard as he could on the brakes. Once the plane reached 380 metres from the end of the runway, the Captain said \"I've got my feet on the brakes as far as I can.\", and the Co-Pilot applied maximum reverse thrust. Now, with the end of the runway appearing close, the Captain applied a full left turn on the aircraft's front wheel to avoid hitting the runway lights. The aircraft left the runway at around 30 knots, and came to a stop 10 metre from the end of the runway in a patch of grass near a golf course.\nOnce the aircraft had stopped, the Captain ordered an immediate evacuation of the aircraft. The crew shut down all three of the aircraft's engines, but in doing so the Co-Pilot knocked the flap lever, retracting the flaps. He fixed this shortly after. All emergency doors were opened and slides deployed without issue, and all 412 passengers and crew evacuated in around 90 seconds, with no serious injuries sustained.\n\n\n== Aftermath and aircraft damage ==\n\nDuring the overrun, the aircraft had suffered significant damage. Firstly, the front gear had folded backwards and forcefully impacted the nose wheel bay. Also, the underside of the fuselage, engines 1 & 3, and the lower freight door had suffered damage and the underside of the engines had flattened, causing ingestion damage. The gear had also dug into the grass, creating deep troughs that also damaged the airport's lighting cables. The damage was slightly worsened during the recovery of the aircraft. After the aircraft was repaired, it was bought by Caledonian Airways, Worldways Canada and Air Algerie, before being scrapped in September 1999\nAfter passengers had left the aircraft, most ran from it, in case of an ensuing explosion or fire. Neither of these occurred. Throughout the recovery process, the wreckage had attracted some attention. Many people came to observe and take photos of the aircraft, stationary at the end of the runway, with investigators from the AAIB around it, attempting to figure out the cause of the accident.\n\n\n== Investigation results ==\n\nInvestigators found that there was nothing wrong with the speed and distance down the runway that the flight landed at. What they did find however, was that the braking efficiency of the L-1011 was not enough to stop the aircraft on the wet runway.\nThe AAIB recommended that the Tristar's runway performance and braking performance on a wet runway should be re-examined, and that all aircraft measured with the same system should also have a re-examining, in case the system was not accurate. They also recommended a re-examining of Runway 14, to make sure that the texture of the runway and the slope was up to standards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBritish Airtours\nBritish Airtours Flight 22M\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis article incorporates material derived from the \"British Airtours Flight 101\" article on the Plane Crash Wiki wiki at Fandom (formerly Wikia) and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License (13 April 2024).",

The monument is constructed over the purported grave of Talha ibn Ubaidullah, one of the Sahaba who is revered in Sunni Islam. \nThe mausoleum is still undergoing construction as of 2018. Formerly it was part of a two-domed mosque complex which was built in 1973 and known as the Talha ibn 'Ubayd Allah Mosque, but in 2006 the mosque building was destroyed with explosives by Shi'ite gunmen in an act of revenge for the 2006 al-Askari mosque bombing. In the same year, the Mausoleum of Anas ibn Malik and several other Sunni mosques were also attacked for the same reason. Currently, the tomb of Talha still survives even though the mosque has been destroyed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslam in Iraq\nList of shrines and mausoleums in Iraq\nList of mosques in Iraq\n\n\n== References ==",

He also made several Barbarians appearances, mostly famously as a fullback against the touring 1961 Springboks, with his try-saving shoulder charge on Avril Malan helping secure a 6–0 win. His tackle was described in the press as \"like a comet burying itself into earth\". He won his solitary Wales cap as a centre in a 1961 Five Nations match against France in Paris.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHaydn Mainwaring at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Luis Henrique Carmo Rebello (né Rebelo; 16 July 1970 – 10 May 2015) was an Indian drummer known for his work in tiatr (theatre) productions. The son of musician and khell tiatr pioneer Mastor, he got his big break at the age of 14 in Konkani playwright Menino de Bandar's tiatr Succorina staged in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLuis Henrique Carmo Rebello (né Rebelo) was born on 16 July 1970, in the ward of Pequeno, Pulvaddo in Benaulim, Goa. He comes from a family with a musical background, as his father João Santana Rebelo, also known as Mastor (transl. Master), was involved in the khell tiatr circles as a musician, agriculturist, and farmer. Rebello learned drumming at an early age, receiving guidance from his father, who was proficient in drums, as well as double bass and trumpet. He grew up in a large family, having six brothers named Joaquim, Eduardo, Flavino, Antonio, Agnelo, and Pascoal, and a sister named Jesuina. His mother, Faustina Florina Rodrigues, was a homemaker from Orlim, Goa.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRebello embarked on his professional journey as a drummer, initiating his career through a collaborative effort with his uncle in a brass band. At a young age of 14, he received his first significant opportunity in the realm of music when he stepped in as a substitute drummer for his brother, Jack, who had relocated to Delhi. This debut occurred in the Konkani playwright Menino de Bandar's theatrical production titled Succorina. Rebello's talent quickly captured the attention of various Konkani directors, including Patrick Dourado, Ben Evangelisto, and Prince Jacob, among others, leading to several collaborations. Seeking new horizons, Rebello later ventured to Delhi, where he embarked on a seven-year tenure as a percussionist for the acclaimed band Seby And The Wings. His drumming skills also found expression in his contributions to Indian bands such as Black Slades and Tantriks. However, his heart eventually led him back to his hometown of Goa in 2007, where he dedicated himself to the world of tiatrs, a distinctive form of Goan musical theatre.\nUpon returning to Goa, Rebello joined forces with the Konkani actor Prince Jacob's theatrical troupe, making contributions for approximately five years. His drumming prowess resonated not only in live performances but also in the realm of audio cassette recordings, as well as during solemn occasions such as feasts and funerals throughout Goa. In 2011, Rebello further enriched his artistic journey by becoming a member of Comedian Agostinho's theatrical troupe, where his drumming skills embellished their performances until 2015. Known for his commitment, Rebello proved himself as an indispensable troupe member, having served for a six-year tenure. The culmination of Rebello's career took place during his final performance in Comedian Agostinho's tiatr production titled Picnic, held at Bacbhatt, Raia, Goa, on 9 May 2015. Furthermore, Rebello made contributions to the theatrical productions by assisting with ticket sales at the ticket counter in Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, during tiatr shows.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJack and Agnelo Rebello, who are also musicians in the Konkani industry, are siblings of Rebello. On 2 December 2011, their father Mastor died at his residence in Pulvaddo, Benaulim, Goa, at the age of 83. Rebello himself lived in Maddar, Benaulim. He died without having made any formal provisions, such as drafting a will, gifting assets, or expressing any specific last wishes. Subsequently, on 10 August 2020, it was officially recorded that Rebello's mother, Faustina, became the sole beneficiary of his estate, as no other individuals or legal heirs were identified under the prevailing succession laws of the state of Goa.\n\n\n== Death ==\nRebello, during his association with Comedian Agostinho's dramatic troupe, had concluded his performance at Bacbhatt in Raia, Goa. After the theatrical presentation, he packed his drums and handed them over to the stage manager before leaving the venue for the drama at around 11:15 pm on 9 May. On the morning of 10 May 2015, at around 7 am, Rebello's lifeless body was found next to the roadside in Colleandongor, Raia. Nearby, his scooter, the mode of transport he used, was located a short distance from where he was found. Upon notification, the Maina, Curtorim police promptly arrived at the scene and conducted an inquest panchanama to document witness testimonies. It was during this procedure that the contents of Rebello's purse were meticulously examined, leading to the subsequent identification.\nRebello had encountered two minor strokes earlier, but an extensive examination conducted by law enforcement officials established that his death was primarily due to a significant cardiac arrest that occurred subsequent to his performance at Bacbhatt, Raia. However, the conclusive findings of the postmortem report were still pending at the time of these events. As per official police reports, Rebello's relatives visited the nearby police precinct to provide details about his previous heart ailment. The police ascertained that Rebello's body lay by the roadside, with his scooter positioned nearby. No indications of foul play were observed, thereby dispelling any initial suspicions.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nPrince Jacob, the then-president of the Tiatr Academy of Goa, paid tribute to Rebello, acknowledging his contributions to the tiatrist fraternity. In Jacob's view, Rebello's death represented a profound loss, not only as a drummer but also as a humble and dedicated team player. Jr. Nelson, in his appraisal of Rebello, highlighted his musical abilities coupled with a grounded and disciplined demeanor. Nelson noted that Rebello was known for his reserved nature, rarely speaking unless necessary. Ivo Furtado, a drummer from Raia, Goa characterized Rebello as a soft-spoken figure who exuded a brotherly presence. Furtado emphasized Rebello's extensive knowledge and expertise in the field of drumming. Comedian Agostinho fondly remembered Rebello as a man who never voiced complaints or prioritised personal gain. According to Agostinho, Rebello's selflessness was evident in his focus on the collective rather than individual interests.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn September 2016, a musical event was organized by the family of Rebello in honor of his birthday. Singers and musicians from the Konkani stage graced the occasion, captivating a substantial audience. Antonette de Maina and Tony de Ribandar presented a birthday song in honor of Rebello, whereas Osvy Viegas and Jr. Reagan paid homage through a musical duet performance. The lineup of performers included Rioma Menezes, Rosy Alvares, Alika Cardozo, Lawry Travasso, Seby Fernandes (known for his work in \"Mira Mira\"), Marcus Vaz, Xavier Gomes, Comedian Selvy, Osvi Viegas, Jr. Reagan, and Peter-Roshan, who delivered musical renditions. The audience was treated to comedic acts by Janet, Agostinho, Selvy, Bryan, Luis Bachchan, and Ambe. The musical arrangements were provided by an ensemble comprising Joaquim D'Souza, Roy Menezes (saxophone), Theo Alvares, Anthony de Velim (trumpet), James Vaz, Rohan Denis (keyboard), Wilbur Rebello (bass), John Fernandes, and Jack (drums; brother of Rebello). Konkani director Mario Menezes fulfilled the role of hosting duties on the program, and figures such as Damu Naik (Chairperson of Ravindra Bhavan), Maria Rebello (Zilla Parishad member), and Fr. Benjamin (vicar of Seraulim Church) were among the notable attendees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agnes Melinda Kovacs is a psychologist, linguist and cognitive scientist based at the Central European University.\n\n\n== Education, career and honours ==\nKovacs received an MSc in psychology from Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2002, then studied for a PhD at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy, which she received in 2008. Her doctoral studies focused on bilingualism and theory of mind.\nFrom 2008 to 2010 she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Psychology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, supported by a Marie Curie research fellowship. In 2010 she moved to the Central European University to continue her postdoctoral research at the Cognitive Development Center there.\nIn 2012 Kovacs was the recipient of a European Research Council Starting Grant for her project REPCOLLAB (Representational preconditions for understanding other minds in the service of human collaboration and social learning), which she carried out at the Central European University (CEU). She was promoted to Research Fellow in 2015 and took up a position as associate professor in 2017. She is currently director of the Cognitive Development Center at CEU.\nIn 2019 Kovacs was elected ordinary member of the Academia Europaea.\n\n\n== Research ==\nKovacs's team combines methods from cognitive neuroscience with ideas from philosophy of mind. Their focus is on understanding the minds of others, and they conduct neuroimaging and behavioural experiments on infants and adults. In her early work, conducted with Jacques Mehler among others, she investigated the effects of bilingualism on executive functions and on false-belief reasoning.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nKovacs, Agnes Melinda. 2009.

She rose to the temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was awarded a Royal Red Cross medal for gallantry. In peace time she was matron at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShippen was born in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood in 1894. Her Australian mother was Jessie McKinley (born Taylor) and her British born father was William Yeomans John Johns. She was their second child and they had two more. She trained as a nurse and as a mid-wife and in 1940 she was promoted to matron at the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. The appointment was short as she volunteered to join the Australian Army Nursing Service. She joined the service and in October 1940 she was promoted again to the rank of matron.\nIn 1941 she was with the 2/7th Australian General Hospital in the Middle East where she was in charge of a 1200 bed hospital near Jerusalem at Rehovot. She moved to other locations and in February 1943 she was back in Australia. In April that year her \"gallant and distinguished service\" was rewarded with a first class Royal Red Cross medal and she was promoted to the rank of Major. In October she rejoined the 2/7th AGH who by then were in Papua New Guinea.\nWhen the war ended she returned to Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital again as matron.\nAfter the war she was the 2/7th AGH Association's patron and a proud attendee of Anzac Day parades for several years wearing her Royal Red Cross and other medals. In 1953 she was briefly the wife of John Mitchell Shippen before he died.\nShippen died in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield in 1982.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

A local businessman seeks to demolish the school and bought the land on which the school is located. However, a memorialist finds a photo of his grandfather in the attic and begins to search for the history of the place while trying to fight the entrepreneurial Mammon. The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from the previous installment. The player asks questions to witnesses of past events and slowly unravels the story.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Southwell Trail is a 7.5-mile (12.1 km) long multi-user trail, for use on foot, cycle and horseback, that links Bilsthorpe and Southwell in the English county of Nottinghamshire. It uses parts of the track bed of two former railway lines. It has been designated as a Local Nature Reserve.\n\n\n== Route ==\nThe trail starts at Forest Link in Billsthorpe, from where a quiet on-road route is signed to the Bilsthorpe Line Multi-User Route. From Billsthorpe the trail heads south to the site of Farnsfield station. An access path heads west from here to the A614, whilst the trail proper heads east to the site of Kirklington station. From here the trail turns south-east past the historic mill and hamlet of Maythorne to reach its terminus at the site of Southwell station.There are car parks at Forest Link in Billsthorpe, and at the three former station sites of Farnsfield, Kirklington and Southwell. At Southwell, there is a public house, the Final Whistle, next to the end of the trail, which is about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) from the centre of Southwell town and its famous Minster and Cathedral.Between Kirklington station and Maythorne, the Southwell Trail shares its route with the Robin Hood Way, a waymarked long-distance footpath that links many places with connections to Robin Hood.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe section of the trail from Farnsfield to Southwell was opened as a railway in 1871, when the Midland Railway built a line connecting Southwell to Mansfield. This line, together with a pre-existing line between Southwell and Rolleston, formed the Rolleston Junction to Mansfield railway line, which carried both freight and passenger traffic.The line between Mansfield and Southwell closed to passengers in 1929, but continued to be heavily used by freight trains, especially to and from the collieries near Mansfield. In 1931 a new freight line was opened from Farnsfield to Ollerton via Bilsthorpe, and it is this route of this line that is used by the Bilsthorpe to Farnsfield section of the trail. However, by 1968 all the lines used by the trail had closed completely.In the early 1970s, Nottinghamshire County Council purchased the section of the line from Southwell to Farnsfield and beyond to the crossing of the A614, together with the section of the Ollerton branch as far as Bilsthorpe. This was converted into the Southwell Trail, initially as a bridleway. In 2005–6, the trail was resurfaced and converted into a multi-user route.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscover Southwell Trail leaflet from Nottinghamshire County Council",

Although they accepted both the forms Krishna and Vishnu is Supreme God, they argued over which of these forms are the primary name/form of God.\n\nBhagavad Gita, one of the fundamental sacred texts of Vaishnavism, is considered the revelation of the Supreme God. In Bhagavad Gita, the Supreme God declared His existential position as follows:: 184 अहं सर्वस्य प्रभवो मत्त: सर्वं प्रवर्तते ।\nइति मत्वा भजन्ते मां बुधा भावसमन्विता: ॥ ८ ॥\n\n\"I am the source of all; from Me, all emanates.

Lord of beings! God of gods! Master of the universe!\"\n\n\n=== Gaudiya Vaishnavism ===\n\nIn Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Krishna is considered the prime form and name of Supreme God and foundation of all other forms including Vishnu.

        "content": "Gloria Rachel Noela Guissou Kabré (born 24 December 1995) is a Burkinabé karateka and women's rights activist who was named Yennenga of the Year in 2023 for her work on promoting and developing female talent in sports in Burkina Faso. In 2019, she became the first Burkinabé woman to earn a medal at the African Games.\n\n\n== Sports career ==\nGuissou's father, Clément Guissou, was a master karateka and karate coach, who started training his daughter when she was five. Between 2012 and 2020, Guissou was Burkina Faso's national champion in the 68 kg category. At the 2019 African Games in Rabat, Morocco, Guissou earned a bronze medal after defeating Thabang Mosa Maleke from Botswana by 11 to 7 in the kumite +68 kg category. Guissou became the first Burkinabé woman to earn a medal at the African Games, and additionally was the first Burkinabé athlete, male or female, to earn a medal for karate. In recognition of her achievement, the Association of Sports Journalists of Burkina named her as the best karateka of 2019, as well as one of the top athletes of the year.\nThe government of Burkina Faso subsequently offered Guissou the opportunity to train in Europe, and Guissou expressed hope to participate in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Guissou opted to remain in Burkina Faso after getting married, and after the 2020 Olympics were delayed to the COVID-19 pandemic, she publicly stated her uncertainty as to whether she would qualify, citing her husband's reluctance to wait another year before having a child.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nGuissou gained greater recognition in Burkina Faso following her African Games success, and subsequently spoke out in favour of gender equality in sports, criticising Burkinabé sporting associations for sending twice as many men to international sporting events than women, despite female Burkinabé athletes statistically earning twice as many medals as their male counterparts. Guissou also criticised cultural norms that led to the stigmatising of women in sport, including stating that her mother had been reluctant to permit Guissou to train as a karateka due to concerns it would negatively impact upon her marriage prospects.\nGuissou subsequently set up a karate school for girls, as well as a local women's karate team, at the Avenir Karate Club in Paspanga.\nIn November 2021, Guissou established RINGO, a sports association that aimed to support female athletes both practically and mentally when participating in international competitions. RINGO has gone on to expand its scope, including in 2024 launching an initiative to teach self-defence skills to Burkinabé women in all of the country's regions, citing gender violence that prevailed in Burkina Faso.\nIn addition to her sports work and activism, Guissou obtained a master's degree in water, hygiene and sanitation in the international cooperation sector from Ouagadougou Youth Polytechnic School. She interned with the European Union mission in Burkina Faso, and spent six months working as a chemist consultant in Mali.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2023, Guissou was named as Yennenga of the Year by Canal+ Burkina, in recognition of her work promoting and developing female talents in sport.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dead Talents Society (Chinese: 鬼才之道) is a 2024 Taiwanese horror comedy film directed and written by John Hsu, starring Chen Bolin, Sandrine Pinna and Gingle Wang. Set in a fictional underworld, the film revolves around ghosts who aspire to become the most successful and renowned stars with their scare tactics and performances among the living.\nThe film is set to have its world premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2024, and will be theatrically released on August 17 in Taiwan.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nChen Bolin as Makoto\nSandrine Pinna as Catherine\nGingle Wang as The Rookie\nChing-i Pai\nSoso Tseng\nAdditionally, Eleven Yao, Huang Di-Yang, Lung Lung, Da-her Lin, Daniel Chan and David Chu have been cast in undisclosed roles. YouTuber Milla is set to have a cameo appearance as a news anchor in the underworld.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nFollowing the commercial success of the 2019 horror film Detention, director John Hsu decided to take a lighter and comedic approach for his new project. Noticing the growing popularity of ghost-themed films, he collaborated with screenwriter Tsai Kun-Lin to develop a never-before-filmed idea in 2020 which later evolved into Dead Talents Society. In February 2021, the duo invested over NT$1 million to shoot a 6.5-minute teaser, which generated significant buzz and online discussions. Originally scheduled to begin filming in late 2021, the duo spent two years refining the screenplay, going through more than twenty versions, which Hsu attributed to the unexpected popularity of the teaser. On January 19, 2022, Sony Pictures International Productions (SPIP) and Taiwanese production company Activator announced their collaboration to co-produce the film. This marked SPIP's first Taiwanese production in twenty years since the 2002 film Double Vision, with SPIP funding over half of the film's budget. SPIP also acquired worldwide distribution and adaptation rights. Due to the extensive number of VFX shots, the film underwent an additional year of post-production after filming. An official trailer was released on April 1, 2024.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn February 2021, Chen Bolin and Sandrine Pinna appeared in the teaser and confirmed their involvement in the lead roles, and YouTuber Milla was set to make a cameo appearance. In December 2022, Gingle Wang, Ching-i Pai and Soso Tseng were added to the cast. Eleven Yao, Huang Di-Yang, Lung Lung, Da-her Lin, Daniel Chan, and David Chu were later revealed to be part of the ensemble through the official trailer released in April 2024.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography was initially scheduled to begin in 2021, but was delayed until December 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The underworld hotel in the film was primarily shot at Champagne Hotel in Jiaoxi, Yilan. The production crew spent a month renovating the ninth floor and constructing a fake elevator set to recreate the 1970s-80s vibes. Filming also took place in Zhongshan District, Keelung, and concluded in January 2023.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film is set to have its world premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2024, and will be theatrically released on August 17 in Taiwan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDead Talents Society at IMDb",

        "content": "Pierre Gallon, born on (1986-03-27)March 27, 1986 in Falaise (Normandy), is a French harpsichordist, organist, and fortepianist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBrother of cellist François Gallon and son of lutenist Pascal Gallon, he grew up immersed in early music, leading him to start playing the harpsichord around the age of 9, at the Caen Conservatory, under Bibiane Lapointe and Thierry Maeder. Simultaneously, he also studied the violin. He was admitted to the Paris Conservatory in 2006 and graduated four years later from the harpsichord and basso continuo classes of Olivier Baumont and Blandine Rannou. According to his biography on his website, he considers his encounters with Blandine Verlet, Élisabeth Joyé, and Pierre Hantaï as key moments in his learning journey.\nHe has over thirty recordings to his name, notably with the Ensemble Pygmalion, where he is the principal harpsichordist, the Ensemble Correspondences, and Le Poème Harmonique. Until 2022, he recorded solo for the independent label L'Encelade.\nHis first recording, dedicated to Renaissance publisher Pierre Attaingnant, was highlighted by France Musique through its selection program Choix de France Musique. Since then, Pierre Gallon is regularly invited as a soloist to La Roque d'Anthéron, the Saintes Festival, La Folle Journée de Nantes, the Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht, etc. His album dedicated to the musical legacy of lutenists in the harpsichord music of the Grand Siècle, titled Blancrocher, l'Offrande (L'Encelade, 2020), was acclaimed by critics; it notably received ffff from Télérama, the Diapason d’Or from the specialized magazine of the same name, and a Choc from the music magazine Classica.\nSince 2017, he has also ventured into Classical repertoire as evidenced by his album Haydn, per il Cembalo solo with L'Encelade and, more recently, in duo with soprano Alice Foccroulle, an album of Lieder by Joseph Haydn, where he is found playing the fortepiano (Haydn, Deutsche Lieder, Passacaille, 2021).\nHe divides his concert activities between recitals, productions directed by Raphaël Pichon, and chamber music; he is regularly found alongside violist Lucile Boulanger, writer Pascal Quignard, soprano Alice Foccroulle, violinist Alice Julien-Laferrière, and harpsichordists Bertrand Cuiller, Yoann Moulin, or Freddy Eichelberger.\nIn 2024, he joined the record label Harmonia Mundi International.\n\n\n== Recent Discography ==\n\n\n=== Solo ===\n2014: Pierre Attaingnant: Auprès de vous.

        "content": "Elektro Moskva is a 2013 Austrian music documentary film directed and written by Elena Tikhonova and Dominik Spritzendorfer. It is their directorial debut. The film is an essayistic exploration of Soviet and post-Soviet \"electro-history\", spanning from Theremin to synthesizers to KGB surveillance tools.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe documentary delves into the nearly century-long history of Soviet and Russian experimental electronic music, employing archival footage and contemporary interviews, for example with musician Alexei Borisov, to offer insight into the cultural and social changes within Russia. It pays homage to the pioneers of futuristic sounds, illustrating the evolution of electronic music within both Soviet and post-Soviet contexts. Additionally, it underscores the relationship between musical technology and military research, the clandestine nature of musical experimentation by circuit-benders amidst political censorship, and the ingenuity of the individuals responsible for pioneering electronic instruments.\n\n\n== Production ==\nElektro Moskva is an independently produced documentary, Dominik Spritzendorfer served as the producer. The film received financial grants from Austrian Ministry of Education and Lower Austria cultural fund. The picture was shot over a period of eight years.

        "content": "Ana Paula Mata Bernardo (born 1968) is a Portuguese trade unionist and politician. As a member of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS), she was elected as a deputy in the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic in January 2022, representing the Porto constituency, and was re-elected in 2024 to represent the Lisbon constituency. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBernardo was born in Pau, France on 20 October 1968. When she was eight her family returned to Portugal and lived in Belmonte in the Castelo Branco district. She studied there until her final year in secondary school, which she took in Lisbon. She then studied for an undergraduate degree in economics in Lisbon. \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1991, Bernardo began working for UGT, the umbrella trade union organization in Portugal. In 2022 she was deputy general secretary of the union. In 2016 she was appointed as a consultant to the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a position she held until 2022. She then left both positions, having been elected in 2022 as a deputy in the Assembly of the Republic, representing the Porto constituency as a member of the Socialist Party (PS), which won an overall majority in that election. She served as vice-president of the committee on Labour, Social Security and Inclusion in the assembly. Following allegations of corruption against some members of the government in 2023, and the resignation of the prime minister, António Costa, the president called for new elections. In the 2024 election, Bernardo switched constituencies and was tenth on the list of PS candidate for the Lisbon constituency, with the party winning 15 seats.\nDuring the 15th Legislature of the Third Portuguese Republic (2022–2024), Bernardo was appointed as the rapporteur of a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the Portuguese national airline, TAP Air Portugal, which had the specific task of looking at whether there was any political interference in the management of the airline. She was reluctant to take on the task because she knew that it would put her in the spotlight and, according to her colleagues, she has a very shy nature. The report was heavily criticised, although according to her it was designed to be a first draft to promote subsequent dialogue.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Groupe Espace was a French avant-garde artistic movement between 1951 and 1960. The group was founded by architect André Bloc in 1951 and members associated with the journal Art d'Aujourd'hui [Art Today]. Their purpose was to create a new environment appropriate to modern society. They envisaged art as a social phenomenon - not an individual one.\nMembers of the group included Jean Dewasne, Jean Gorin, Jean Messagier, Jean Le Moal, Edgard Pillet, Erno Goldfinger, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Frits Glamer, Gianni Monnet, Gualtiero Nativi and Nicolas Schöffer. \nThere was also the London Branch of Groupe Espace from 1953 to 1959, founded by Paule Vézelay.\n\n\n== Purpose of the group ==\n\"Espace\" means \"space\" in French, and the group was interested in promoting art located in the physical and social environment. A second meaning of the word was concerned with space as a compositional element \"by which space within a three-dimensional art work allowed for its penetration by light.\"\nGroupe Espace sought to break away from traditional artistic conventions and explore new forms of expression, particularly in abstract art. Groupe Espace was influenced by various avant-garde movements of the time, including Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism and Art Informel.\nPiet Mondrian wrote in his 1937 essay \"Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art (Figurative Art and Non-Figurative Art)\" published in the book CIRCLE: \"Art will not only continue but will realize itself more and more. By the unification of architecture, sculpture, and painting, a new plastic reality will be created. Painting and sculpture will not manifest themselves as separate objects, nor as 'mural art' which destroys architecture itself, nor as 'applied' art, but being purely constructive will aid the creation of a surrounding not merely utilitarian or rational but also pure and complete in its beauty\". In this essay, as the title implies, \"plastic\" art is \"figurative\" and \"objective\"; whereas \"pure plastic\" art is \"non-figurative\" and \"subjective\".\n\n\n== History ==\nAndré Bloc (1896–1966) graduated as an engineer and later became an architect. He founded the journal L'Architecture d'Aujourdhui [Architecture Today] in 1930, and began sculpting in the 1940s. In 1949 he founded the journal  Art d'Aujourd'hui [Art Today] which, in 1954, merged with L'Architecture d'Aujourdhui to become Aujourdhui [Today].\nBloc's artistic output included painting, sculpture, architecture, mosaics, furniture, textile designs and screen prints. He had a life-long interest in Constructivism that pre-dated his own transition from figuration to abstraction in 1945. This Constructivist synthesis of artistic disciplines is reflected in his 1936 book L'Union pour L'Art [The Union of Art].\nGroupe Espace was formed at a meeting in the Grand Palais in Paris, on 17 October 1951. This initial meeting was largely attended by architects, painters, sculptors and neoplasticists. \"Bloc's opening address connected Groupe Espace to the Constructivist tradition and drew a parallel between the aims of the group and those of the pre-war De Stijl and Bauhaus movements.\" The meeting endorsed a Manifesto, an English translation of which can be found by Jeffrey Steele in Appendix A of Alan Fowler's PhD thesis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] Constructivist Art in Britain 1913–2005 by Alan Fowler (2006)",

        "content": "The Bolivarian Youth Games (Spanish: Juegos Bolivarianos de la Juventud) is a regional multi-sport event for athletes of up to 18 years old, organized by the Organización Deportiva Bolivariana (ODEBO). The games are held every four years with the first edition being held in Sucre, Bolivia from 4 to 14 April 2024.\nThe age range for athletes was originally approved following the same criteria as the International Olympic Committee for the Youth Olympic Games (between 15 and 18 years old). However, the first edition accepted athletes between 16 and 19 years old so as not to disrupt the participation of athletes who had been preparing for 2023 before the inaugural event was rescheduled from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nODEBO launched the Bolivarian Youth Games for the first time in 2010 with Lima, Peru to be the host city of the first edition in 2015. In 2017, after several postponements, Peru resigned to host the games giving way to Sucre, Bolivia being named as the new host city on 10 November 2017. Early 2019, the Games were scheduled to be held between 17 April and 1 May 2020, However, the games again went through several postponements due to various circumstances such as the 2019 Bolivian protests or the social and health impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2021 and 2022 the postponements continued, until in April 2023 the First Bolivarian Games were finally scheduled to take place between 5 and 14 April 2024.\n\n\n== The Games ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-aux-Roses (ENS de Fontenay-aux-Roses), established by decree in 1880, was a French higher education institution reserved for women, aimed at training teachers and instructors for primary normal schools.\nIn 1986, coeducation was introduced and the center specialized in humanities and social sciences, renamed École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud. The teaching of exact and applied sciences was transferred to the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon.\n\n\n== History ==\nA century after the creation of the first Normal School (later located on Rue Ulm in Paris), Jules Ferry, with Ferdinand Buisson and pastor Félix Pécaut, established the Higher Normal Schools of Fontenay-aux-Roses for girls (1880), and two years later in Saint-Cloud for boys (1882). Both were located in the Paris region, one in the national park of Saint-Cloud (Pavillon de Valois); the other in the town of Fontenay-aux-Roses, in a building constructed by a disciple of Henri Labrouste. Before the merger of the schools, students from the Saint-Cloud school were nicknamed «Cloutiers», while the girls were known under the name of «Fontenaisiennes».\nThe institution's primary mission was to train new generations of primary education teachers and the first inspectors of primary education. Under the Vichy regime, the schools were named National Preparatory Schools for Teaching in Colleges, and after the Liberation, they took the name Higher Normal Schools Preparatory for Secondary Education Teaching. In 1954, the teaching staff became civil servants, while like the other ENS, under the impetus of the Minister of National Education André Marie, they expanded their mission. From the early 1950s, they were authorized to prepare for the agrégation exam, and then, in 1966, their curriculum was reformed following the model of the École Normale Supérieure de Paris on Rue Ulm. Thus, they could also officially prepare their students for higher education teaching. In 1976, a profound restructuring of all the ENS took place. Some humanities sections like those of the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan were moved to Fontenay-aux-Roses and Saint-Cloud, which became coeducational in 1981.\nIn 1986, the École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-aux-Roses specialized in humanities and social sciences, taking the name École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud, while the scientific sections formed the new École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and were installed in the Gerland district. In 2000, the humanities sections also moved to Lyon, in the new buildings constructed in Gerland by architect Henri Gaudin.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nFélix Pécaut (1880–1896);\nJeanne de Friedberg, delegate (1880–1890);\nLucie Saffroy, delegate (1890–1897);\nJules Steeg, (1896–1898);\nJeanne Dejean de La Bâtie, first delegate (1897–1898) then director (1898–1917);\nAnne-Marie Grauvogel (1917–1935);\nMarguerite Dard (1935–1943);\nAndrée Pardes (1943–1944);\nMarguerite Dard, (1945–1948);\nLouise Maugendre, director of the ENS de Fontenay-aux-Roses (1948–1961);\nMarguerite Cordier, director of the ENS de Fontenay-aux-Roses (1961–1974);\nJacqueline Bonnamour, director of the ENS de Fontenay-aux-Roses (1974–1985).\n\n\n== Tribute ==\nThe song Fontenay-aux-Roses by Maxime Le Forestier, from 1972, is a tribute to the normaliennes of the ENS of Fontenay-aux-Roses, where the singer lived for a period of his life.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nYvonne Oulhiou (1981).

Emma Willis is due to present the series, whilst will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones will return as coaches, along with LeAnn Rimes, and Tom Fletcher and Danny Jones who will serve as the programme's first \"double chair\".\n\n\n== Coaches and presenters ==\n\nPrior to the beginning of the previous series, Olly Murs announced that he had been axed from the show, and that the twelfth series would be his last as a coach. The following month, it was announced that Anne-Marie had also been axed from the series with the show's producers reportedly wanting \"refresh the show\". Emma Willis will return for her eleventh series as presenter, whilst will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones are set to return for their thirteenth and twelfth series as coaches respectively. In March 2024, LeAnn Rimes was announced as Anne-Marie's replacement, whilst Murs was replaced by both McFly singers Tom Fletcher and Danny Jones, the latter of whom served as a coach on the spin-off version The Voice Kids since its inception. The pair will make up the show's first ever \"double chair\", a format that has previously been used in other versions of The Voice franchise, which will see them share the same chair and make decisions throughout the series collaboratively.\n\n\n== Production ==\nAuditions for the thirteenth series began taking place throughout June and July 2023 with online applications closing in October 2023. The series will again be pre-recorded, with filming beginning in February 2024 and is set to begin later in the year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Goodenia exigua is a species of flowering plant in the Goodeniaceae family and is endemic to the south of Western Australia. It is a stoloniferous, perennial plant with whorls of spatula-shaped leaves and yellow flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia exigua is a glabrous, stoloniferous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10 cm (3.9 in). The leaves are borne on the stems in irregular whorls of spatula-shaped leaves with a yellowish tip. The leaves are up to 10 mm (0.39 in) long and up to 3 mm (0.12 in) wide. The flowers are borne in cymes or are solitary, with linear bracteoles 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long at the base. The upper sepal is D-shaped, about 1 mm (0.039 in) long and the petals are about 2 mm (0.079 in) long, glabrous and yellow with short wings. The capsule is more or less round and contains wingless seeds about 1 mm (0.039 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nGoodenia exigua was first formally described in 1863 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, from a specimen collected by George Maxwell. The specific epithet (exigua) means \"small\" or \"feeble\", referring to the habit of the plant.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGoodenia exigua is found in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee bioregions of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nThis species of goodenia is classified as \"Priority Two\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is rare or threatened.\n\n\n== References ==",

A music video for the song was released in 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAJR released their debut studio album Living Room on March 3, 2015. During the writing process of this album, the band additionally wrote material for their second album, citing an intention of different sound as their reason for not releasing the songs. One of these songs was titled \"People Person\", with various demos of the song taking inspiration from Irish music and dance music. After lead singer Jack Met incoporated the bugle call \"First Call\" into the song, the concept of \"People Person\" was combined with a sports theme, turning into \"Let the Games Begin\". Upon release, the song was anticipated to be the lead single of the band's second studio album, The Click, but was not included on any album. \"Let the Games Begin\" was additionally used for various Hasbro commercials.\n\n\n== Composition and music video ==\n\"Let the Games Begin\" begins with a bugle call, which is additionally the track's chorus hook. The song is composed with upbeat electronic instrumentation and a prominent beat. \"Spokestep\" is featured in the bridge of \"Let the Games Begin\", which the band refers to as electronically manipulating and cutting up vocals in the style of dubstep.\nA music video for \"Let the Games Begin\" was directed by Jason Merrin and released on February 25, 2016. The video follows the developing popularity of a costumed performer wearing a carrot costume, additionally cutting to the band performing the song in a grocery store.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It received universal acclaim from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nIf I Don't Make It, I Love U received a score of 99 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on four critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Stereogum named it album of the week, with the site's Joshua Minsoo Kim writing that the album \"finds the group aiming for a more robust sound\" and calling \"Sticky\" a \"tremendous showcase of the band's cohesion\". Hayley Scott of The Quietus felt that the band \"embrace, not shun, sounds absorbed from childhood in working-class environments\" including \"skeletal post-rock with soul and jazz, deconstructed by a presiding impulse to blur lines between terms or genres\".\nReviewing the album for Exclaim!, Tom Piekarski described it as \"an engrossing testament to the musical elasticity and emotional potency of rock music\" and \"an album both experimental and laid fully bare—the result is one of the best rock records of the year\". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian called vocalist Jessica Hickie-Kallenbach \"most astonishing of all [...] singing with more power and confidence than ever before. Her luminously soulful voice is a distinctive instrument, with vibrato that makes whole songs shudder with life\". He concluded that Still House Plants are \"the most vital band in Britain today, in every sense, and we will be blessed indeed if we get a better album from these shores all year\". The Skinny's Joe Creely remarked that it is \"marginally more sonically polished, but loses nothing of their angular charm, if anything bringing out more of the thrashy energy and emotional heft of their live shows\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStill House Plants\n\nJessica Hickie-Kallenbach – vocals\nFinlay Clark – guitar\nDavid Kennedy – drums\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nu'man al-Alusi (Arabic: نعمان الآلوسي, 1836–1899), full name Khayr al-Din Nu'man bin Mahmud al-Alusi, was a 19th-century Iraqi Muslim scholar, jurist and calligrapher. The son of the widely acclaimed Hanafi jurist, Mahmud al-Alusi, Nu'man was born in Baghdad. He later rose to prominence himself as an early supporter of the Salafi movement, which was slowly spreading at the time.\nMuhammad Bahjat Athari described Nu'man al-Alusi as “Generous, loyal, ascetic, sweet as a fruit, and a forgiving person.” He was also praised by Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, while he was also credited by Albani in the introduction of his book Sharh al-Ayat al-Bayinat fi Iyadam Sama'i al-Amwat.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNu'man al-Alusi was one of Mahmud al-Alusi's scholarly sons. At first, he took knowledge from his own father, but later on as he grew up he became a student of Mullah Qasim Effendi. He served as a qadi (Islamic judge) in several towns, including Hillah. In the year 1878, Nu'man al-Alusi travelled to Egypt where he studied the works of Siddiq Hasan Khan, a prominent Indian Muslim scholar of the Ahlul Hadith movement. Siddiq Hassan Khan's works were one of those which influenced the ideology and thinking process of Nu'man. Later in 1882, he migrated to Istanbul, Turkey, but he stayed for two years only. After his stay, he returned to his hometown with the title of Muda'ir al-Madrasa (head teacher).\nNu'man al-Alusi was one of the famous calligraphers of his time, and he took up the hobby of calligraphy from his father. He was fluent in the Rayhani script, and he wrote letters and books in this form. Some of his work is preserved in the archives of the public libraries in Baghdad.\n\nNu'man al-Alusi died in Baghdad at the age of 63, and he was buried in the grounds of the Murjan Mosque.\n\n\n== Views and teachings ==\nNu'man al-Alusi was one of the early advocates of the Salafi movement. However, he also became affiliated with Naqshbandi order of Sufism. His book Jala' al-'Aynayn was intended to serve as a guidebook or manual to the Athari creed, which was conflated with Salafism at the time. It featured quotes from the Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyyah. Siddiq Hasan Khan mistakenly considered Nu'man al-Alusi a Maturidi but his verdict was not well-known or widespread.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAmong his works include;\n\nJala' al-'Aynayn fi Muhakamat al-'Ahmadayn\nAl-Ayat al-Bayinat fi Iyadam Sama'i al-Amwat (The Clear Verses on whether the Dead can Hear You)\n'Akmal al-Kitab al-Hadiqat al-Wurud (The complete book of the Rose Gardens)\nAl-Jawab al-Fasih lima lafaqqahu 'Abd al-Masih (Detailed Response in refutation of 'Abdul-Masih)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMahmud Shukri al-Alusi\nMahmud al-Alusi\nList of Atharis\nSalafism\n\n\n== References ==",

It took on the name Trud, (Trud Sports Society of the Soviet Union).\nThe stadium had a gym, a football pitch, stands with 5,000 seats, a 400 metres cinder track for motorcycle racing, wrestling and weightlifting halls; one basketball court, two volleyball courts, two city and two hockey courts, a mini-football court, two rehabilitation centres. \nThe venue held association football national championship matches from 1963 to 1967 but the main pastime was speedway and ice speedway. Meetings included the Soviet Union ice championships in 1961, 1962, 1966 and 1988 and the Russian ice Championships in 1962, 1969 and 1970. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union the stadium ran into disrepair before eventually being demolished in 2005, making way for a new multi-purpose arena known as the Ufa Arena.\n\n\n== Bashkiria Ufa speedway team ==\nDuring the inaugural season of the Soviet Union Championship in 1962, Ufa had no less than four teams competing in the league championship. Bashkiria Ufa (Bashkiria meaning Bashkortostan) won the championship and became the first champions of the Soviet Union. Other teams known as the Rockets, Comets and Meteors also participated in that first season. \nThe following season in 1963, there were five teams including a team called Devon Ufa/Oktyabrskya, a collaboration between the two Bashkortostan cities of Oktyabrsky and Ufa. In 1964, teams from Ufa filled the first two places in the Championship standings and Bashkiria Ufa dominated Soviet speedway from 1967 to 1970, winning four consecutive league titles.\nWithe the emergence of several other clubs, particularly Turbina Balakovo, the dominance was ended but Bashkiria Ufa still went on to win five more titles before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nThe team then raced in the Russian Team Speedway Championship from 1993, winning the title and creating the distinction, whereby they won both the very first league championships of both the Soviet Union and Russia.

        "content": "The 2024 Northern Mariana Islands general election will be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, corresponding with the elections of other federal and state offices, including the nationwide 2024 United States House of Representatives elections and the 2024 United States general elections.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn the economic front, the Northern Mariana Islands faces many problems that were present in the 2022 general election. The territory is still attempting to recover after the COVID-19 Pandemic and its aftermath caused a complete collapse of the local tourism industry, creating a massive economic burden on the territory. Airlines have sent mixed signals on tourism recovery. Asiana Airlines suspended its flights and switched to a charter schedule until June 2024, citing low demand and the Commonwealth Ports Authority (CPA) adoption of a 90 percent hike in landing fees and a 79 percent increase in terminal rental fees back in September 2023. However, United Airlines and Hong Kong Airlines show positive attitudes towards economic recovery. Dan Weiss, United Airlines managing director for Global Government and Regulatory Affairs, stated that United is pleased with the performance of their “relatively new” Saipan-Tokyo Narita service. After suspending its flights from Hong Kong to Saipan in 2019, Hong Kong Airlines announced that it would reintroduce its exclusive direct route to Saipan. Despite confidence from Hong Kong Airlines, the worsening relations between the United States and China signals that Chinese and Hong Kong tourists, once a cornerstone of the local tourism industry, will likely not return to the levels seen before the COVID-19 Pandemic. Less tourists from China will likely negatively impact the economy because, as Marianas Visitors Authority board chair Gloria Cavanagh points out, based on numbers the MVA has collected, Chinese tourists coming into the CNMI outspend their Korean counterparts by multiple times. However, it appears that Chinese tourists, despite tensions with the United States, as well as Japanese and Korean tourists, despite their ongoing economic woes with a weaker Yen and Won compared to the Dollar, continue to come to the CNMI as the number of tourists have increased in January, February, and March of 2024 compared to the same months in 2023, though still below pre-pandemic levels. \nThe declining population has led to lower tax revenue and worse social services and economic conditions, leading to more people leaving and creating a cycle that is difficult to break and is placing pressure on the local government, especially on the incumbents.\nA defining aspect of Governor Arnold Palacios' Administration is austerity. On April 24, 2023, the Palacios Administration placed some executive branch employees on a 72-hour work schedule, reduced from 80 hours. On October 4, 2023, Palacios reduced the work schedule to 70 hours. Governor Palacios and his administration, through Directive 2024–1, also continued \"Austerity Monday,\" which began in October 2020 when his predecessor, former Governor Ralph Torres, implemented it. Austerity Monday calls for the government to be closed every Monday following a payday or on a Tuesday if that Monday happens to be a holiday. The Commonwealth Ports Authority board also adopted an eight-hour cut for all CPA employees and suspended its airline incentive program. Palacios and his coalition government implemented these measures to address fiscal issues but have placed significant strain on the local economy and could pose an issue to the current governing coalition of Independents and Democrats.\nThe mixed recovery, coupled with the strong push for austerity by the Palacios Administration, has created discontent among local small businesses, many of whom have voiced that the government could be doing more to support the local economy and its fledgling and crippled businesses. The economic situation has created a scenario where locals, especially government officials and small businesses, watch for any docking cruise ship whose passengers disembark to spend and help prop up the local economy.\nSince the 2022 general election, the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives has comprised mainly independents, with thirteen seats compared to the three held by the Republicans and the four held by the Democrats. The Northern Mariana Islands Senate has Independents as the second largest bloc with three seats, behind the Republicans, who hold four seats, but ahead of the Democrats, who hold two seats. This is a rarity in the United States, where the Democrats and Republicans rarely ever face a unified independent bloc or viable third parties, and places the Northern Mariana Islands, which has a recent record of successful third parties and independent majorities, in a unique politician position.\nThe CNMI is also witnessing a healthcare system that is inadequate to meet the needs of the territory, with many taking trips to neighboring Guam to obtain the services they need.\n\n\n== Delegate to the US House of Representatives ==\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Delegate Gregorio Sablan, a Democrat, announced that he will not be seeking reelection and endorsed fellow Democrat and current majority leader of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives, Ed Propst. Sablan, first elected in 2008, had held the seat since its creation in 2009. The CNMI Republican Party endorsed Kimberlyn King-Hinds, former chair of the Commonwealth Ports Authority Board of Directors, as their candidate after John \"Bolis\" Gonzales, business consultant and independent candidate for U.S. House in 2008, withdrew from the primary, citing the primary being only for party members as his reason, and announced that he will be running as an independent. The Northern Mariana Islands' non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives are elected for a two-year term.\n\n\n== Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature ==\n\n\n=== Results summary ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\nThe Northern Mariana Islands Senate is the upper house of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature, consisting of nine senators representing three senatorial districts (Saipan & the Northern Islands, Tinian & Aguijan, and Rota), each a Multi-member district with three senators. The governing Democrat-Independent coalition is entering the 2024 election cycle with five of nine seats, a majority over the four seats controlled by the Republicans. Each district had one seat open for the 2024 elections.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nThe Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives is the lower house of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature. The house has seven districts and five of the seven are Multi-member districts. The governing Democrat-Independent coalition is entering the 2024 election cycle with sixteen of twenty seats, an overwhelming majority over the minority bloc of three Republicans and one independent. All twenty seats were up for the 2024 elections.\n\n\n== Municipal Council ==\n\n\n== Board of education ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Groove Production was a record label formed by Chris Palmer. The majority of recordings were in the dance and disco genre. Artists to have their material released on the label include Bunny Brown, Cayenne, T. C. Curtis, The Evasions, K.I.D., Morrissey-Mullen, Surface Noise, and Linda Taylor. Hits that came though the label include \"Body Shake\", \"(You're) In The Pocket\", \"You and Me Just Started\", \"Roberto Who?\"  and \"Wikka Wrap\" etc.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe founder of the label was Chris Palmer the owner of Groove Records in Soho's Greek Street.\nFollowing what was described by Record Business as the runaway indie success of the song \"Wikka Wrap\", the label issued their first album in mid-1981 which was Roberto Who? by Cayenne.\nThe Groove Production recording artist Surface Noise was a pseudonym for Chris Palmer. The track \"The Scratch\" which is credited to his pseudonym is listed at no. 12 on the Classic Pop Top 20 80s pop instrumentals list in 2022. This was Palmer's first production for the label and he played most of the instruments on the recording.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1980 ===\nSurface Noise's \"The Scratch\" was released on Groove Production GP 101 in May 1980. It was reviewed in the May 24, 1980 issue of Record Mirror. The prediction was that it was going to be huge. And on that week it had moved up from no. 84 to no. 50 in the Disco Top 90 chart.\nIt was noted by Record Mirror in the August 16 issue that Surface Noise's \"Dancin' On a Wire\" bw \"Love Groove\" was a breaker.\nBunny Brown recorded \"Strawberry Letter 23\" which was released in 12\" vinyl format on Groove Production GP 103 in 1980.\n\n\n=== 1981 ===\nThe Roberto Who? album by Cayenne was released on Groove Production GPLP 30 in June 1981. It featured Linda Taylor on vocals. Cayenne's single \"Roberto Who?\", credited to Cayenne featuring Linda Taylor debuted no. 30 in the Record Business Disco Top 50 chart on the week of July 20.\nMusic trade magazine Record Business had published their quarterly survey in their July 20, 1981 issue. The single \"Wikka Wrap\" was at no. 3 in the Top Disco / Soul Singles and no. 27 in the Top 30 Indie Singles.\nLinda Taylor recorded the song \"(You're) In The Pocket\" which was released on a 12\" single on Groove Production GP 109. It debuted at no. 48 in the Record Business Disco Top 50 chart on the week of September 21. On the week of October 5, it had moved up to no. 31.\n\n\n=== 1982 ===\n\"Body Shake\" by T.C. Curtis made its debut at no. 14 on the Record Business Twelve Inchers chart on the week of January 11. It was also at its fourth week in the magazine's Disco Top 50 chart and had moved up from no. 45 to no. 23.\nIt was noted in the February 8, 1982 issue of Record Business that Chris Palmer had returned to the UK from Midem where he had set up world-wide licensing deals for Linda Taylor's new album Taylor Made which hadn't yet been completed.\nIt was reported in the April 19, 1982, issue of Record Business that Groove Productions formerly known as Groove Records had stopped using Pinnacle as their distributor and were now using PRT. The first album to come through the new distributor for the 23rd of that month was the Taylor Made album.\nLinda Taylor's \"You and Me Just Started\" did well for the label. It peaked at no. 8 in the Record Business Disco Top 50 on the week of May 24. It also peaked at no. 5 in the Twelve Inchers chart that week, It spent a total of eleven weeks in the Disco Top 50. It was also a success in the United States on the Dance / Disco Top 80 chart, spending a total of fourteen weeks on the chart, where it peaked at no. 13.\nAccording to James Hamilton in the September 28 issue of Record Mirror, The Evasions were following up on their previous release with \"The Passage\". It was reviewed in the October 16 issue of Record Mirror. It was released on Groove Production GP 114 T in 12\" format.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs - Groove Production\n45Cat - Groove Production - Label Discography",

As of July 2023, the disease had spread to all 77 districts, more than a million cattle had been infected and more than 48,000 of them had died. Economic losses among the farming community was high, resulting from cattle deaths, decrease in milk production which is often permanent in dairy cattle, and loss of oxen used for ploughing. The growth of agricultural sector as a whole is expected to slow down due in part to the severity of the outbreak.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dolly’s Toys was a 1901 British trick film, directed by Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. It may have used stop-motion animation, or a variant of the stop-action technique previously used by Walter R. Booth. Cooper would start producing animated films in 1904, starting with The Enchanted Toymaker. \nMelbourne-Cooper directed the 1908 film His Dreams of Toyland, where toys were brought to life through use of stop-motion animation. Dolly's Toys is a lost film, but if featured a similar plot. This has fueled speculation that it was an early animated film by Melbourne-Cooper. But it may have instead used techniques pioneered by Walter R. Booth in Dreamland Adventures (1907), the techniques of stop-action and double exposure. \n\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl falls asleep. She sleeps with her doll. She dreams that her doll comes to life. \n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1901, Melbourne-Cooper's father died and his photographic studio at Osborne Terrace shut down. At this point, Melbourne-Cooper formed his own companies, the Alpha Trading Company and the Alpha Cinematograph Works. He set up premises at Bedford Park, St. Albans. His film studio included its own film laboratory, workshops, and dressing rooms for its acting cast. \nThe role of the dreaming girl in 'Dolly’s Toys was probably played by the child actress Nellie Dewhurst, who lived in St. Albans. She gave an interview about this role in her later life. \nThe film was a simple short film with tho shots, 80 ft (24 m) in length, and a running time of 1 minute and 20 seconds. The first scene was in live-action, while the scene with the living doll was probably animated shot by shot.     In an interview with Audrey Wadowska (Melbourne-Cooper's daughter), she reported that only one doll was used in the film. She was certain that the film used animation. \nThe film was listed in Robert W. Paul's catalogue of Animatograph pictures. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCrafton, Donald (2015), \"The Trickfilm Tradition\", Before Mickey:The Animated Film 1898-1928, University of Chicago Press, ISBN 978-0226231020\nde Vries, Tjitte; Mul, Ati (2009), \"Stubborn and Ineradicable\", \"They Thought it was a Marvel\": Arthur Melbourne-Cooper (1874-1961) : Pioneer of Puppet Animation, Amsterdam University Press, ISBN 978-9085550167\nStewart, Jez (2021), \"Signing In and Signing Up\", The Story of British Animation, Bloomsbury Publishing, ISBN 9781911239727\n\n\n== External links ==\nDolly's Toys at IMDb",

The magazine featured drawings and writings of Caravaggio, Giorgio de Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, and Ardengo Soffici. Soffici's book Primi principi di una estetica futurista (Italian: First principles of a futurist aesthetic) was serialized in the magazine between June and August 1918 before its publication by the publishing house Vallecchi in 1920. The book was also serialized in other Italian magazines, including La Voce and Valori plastici.\nLa Raccolta aimed at reviving cultural activities immediately after World War I. The magazine opposed the dominant avant-garde perspective adopted in the pre-war Italy and attempted to develop a new approach towards Italian art based on the national tradition. It supported the art movement Return to order or the \"Italian plastic renaissance\" through the metaphysical artists of which the notable example was Caravaggio.\nLa Raccolta folded on 15 February 1919 with the publication of the double issue numbered 11–12. It would be a model for two magazines: Valori plastici and La Ronda.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Edward Haynes (8 July 1855 - 29 October 1935) was an officer in the Royal Engineers and an association footballer, who played in the 1878 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Hampstead in Middlesex (now Greater London), on 8 July 1855, the son of a successful builder named William Haynes, and his wife, Mary Ann (formerly Spragg).  Haynes attended the Royal Military Academy and was commissioned as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in July 1875, having scored the second highest marks on passing out for the year; future football team-mate Oliver Ruck had the fifth-highest score.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nSoon after joining the Engineers at Chatham, he played for the Sappers' second XI in a defeat at home to Rochester.  He scored his first goals for the seconds in a 4–0 win over the obscure Gore Court club of Sittingbourne in January 1876, and stepped up to the firsts for a win over the Gitanos a week later.\nHe made his competitive debut as a centre-forward for the Sappers in the first round of the 1876–77 FA Cup, in a narrow 2–1 win over the Old Harrovians at the Kennington Oval.  He played in all four rounds in which the Sappers took part that season, and missed out on the first two rounds of the 1877–78 FA Cup, scoring on his return to the side in a third round hammering of Druids.  He also scored in the last 6 stage replay against Oxford University, and played in the final, which the Sappers lost to the Wanderers.\n\n\n== Army career ==\nHis football career was cut short by army service; he was sent with the 2nd Field Company to South Africa in December 1878.   He particularly distinguished himself by using a shaving-mirror to develop a system of heliograph signals for transmitting messages to the garrison at Ekowe.  He was twice mentioned in dispatches for conduct in the Zulu War, and also took part in the Bechuanaland Expedition in 1884.\nHe was commissioned as captain on 28 January 1886, major on 1 October 1894, lieutenant-colonel on 15 November 1901 (when he was sent to Ireland), and colonel on 15 November 1904. He seemed to have ended his army career as Chief Engineer of the Eastern Coast defences in 1912, when he reached retirement age.  However he was recalled for service in the First World War before his final retirement.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1890 he married Elizabeth Maude, the daughter of Sir Henry Edward Williams KCB. They had three sons.  He was appointed Companion of the Military Order of the Bath in the 1911 Coronation Honours.\nHis home was at Roborough House on Furze Hill Road in Torquay, and he died at the Mount Stuart Nursing Home in the same town on 29 October 1935.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gelu Voican-Voiculescu (born February 8, 1941, in Bucharest, Romania) is a Romanian politician and former dissident who served as deputy prime minister in the provisional government of Romania (1989–1990). He was also a senator of Buzau in the 1990-1992 legislature, elected on the lists of the National Salvation Front, as well as ambassador to Tunisia and Morocco.\n\n\n== Life in Communist Romania ==\nGelu Voican-Voiculescu is a member of the Sturdza family and a descendant of Michel Sturdza, foreign minister in the national-legionary government. He graduated from \"I.L. Caragiale\" Highschool from Bucharest in 1957 and enrolled at the Petroleum Research Institute of the Faculty of Geology, from which he was expelled in 1959 being considered \"a reactionary\". His expulsion took place in the context created by the wave of repression against youth, which followed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He was incriminated for wearing a cross around his neck and making non-figurative, modernist painting.\nAfter his expulsion, he worked for a year as a probationer at the Bucharest Forage Company, after which he was allowed to re-register at the Faculty of Geology of the University of Bucharest, whose courses he graduated in 1963, obtaining the diploma of geologist engineer. After graduating from the faculty, he worked for 3 years as an engineer in Videle, after which he transferred as a researcher to the Institute of Geological Research for Hydrocarbons where he worked until 1970.\nIn 1970, he was arrested and investigated for violating state security through treason of service secrets and economic espionage, being considered a dangerous agitator among young people. Gelu Voican argued as true reasons for his arrest that he was involved in the students' demonstration on Christmas Day 1968, being related to Ana Șincai, who led this demonstration. He was released from prison after three months without a conviction due to lack of evidence.\nWith the help of some friends, he was hired as a proofreader at the magazine Viața Româneasca where he worked until 1973, when he was allowed to work as a geologist at a design workshop within IPROMIN, the main mining design institute in Romania. Although the institute was disbanded in March 1974, the geotechnical workshop where Voican worked remained in Bucharest in the form of a branch belonging to other institutes in the area. Here he worked on the elaboration of geotechnical studies of the Rosia-Poeni mining objective.\nIn July 1985 he was arrested again and sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in prison on the basis of article 166 of the Criminal Code at that time - „propaganda against the social order“, being accused of broadcasting anti-communist manifestos. Subsequently, according to his own confessions, Gelu Voican Voiculescu was also the actor of a common law process, being accused of cheating at the expense of the public had by falsifying some statements and appropriation of money for some trips. The alleged reasons for his arrest are, according to Gelu Voican, the fact that he owned copies of dozens of books on topics related to esotericism and the initiatory aspects of secret societies.\nHe carried out his sentence at the special section of the Rahova penitentiary, despite the reduced punishment, being released after only one year following an amnesty. During October 1988-August 1989, the Securitate bodies raided his home several times and confiscated his „books and letters“.\n\n\n== Romanian Revolution and after ==\nGelu Voican Voiculescu actively participated in the events during the Revolution of December 1989. He participated as a delegate of the National Salvation Front, along with Victor Atanasie Stănculescu and Virgil Măgureanu, at the trial of Nicolae Ceaușescu on December 25, 1989, and at the execution of the communist leader. He also took care of the burial of the Ceausescu spouses.\nAfter the Revolution of December 1989, he served as deputy prime minister in the first provisional government and in charge of the control of secret services (28 December 1989 - 28 June 1990).\nBy a decree signed on December 26, 1989, by Ion Iliescu, the Department of State Security was included in the Ministry of National Defence. On December 31, 1989, immediately after the arrest the Securitate head Iulian Vlad and his close associates, National Salvation Front Council chairman Ion Iliescu appointed Gelu Voican Voiculescu, at that time deputy prime minister in the Provisional Government, as commander of the former \"structures \"Department of State Security\".Starting January 2, 1990, Nicolae Militaru, together with Gelu Voican Voiculescu, coordinated the takeover by MApN of the Securitate, passing to the analysis of its organizational chart and to the creation of future information structures of Romania. They were based on Security personnel and logistics. Until March 1990 (when the Romanian Intelligence Service was established), Gelu Voican managed the former Securitate archive.\nFollowing the elections of May 20, 1990, he was elected senator de Buzau on the lists of National Salvation Front. As a senator he was part of the Validation Committee. He resigned from the Romanian Parliament on March 19, 1992.\nIn 1994, Gelu Voican was appointed as ambassador in Tunisia by President Ion Iliescu. He was recalled from office two years later, after declaring that he could not represent abroad the new president, Emil Constantinescu.\nAfter the elections in November 2000, Voiculescu returned to diplomacy. He was accredited as ambassador of Romania to Morocco. He returned to Romania in January 2005, after the end of his term as ambassador.\nFor a period of time, he held the position of first vice-president of the Organisation for the Defence of Human Rights.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nFormer Securitate Officer Liviu Turcu stated in a November 2006 interview on the show \"Marius Tuca Show\" at Antena 1 that \"in the final phase of the events of December 1989\", Gelu Voican Voiculescu took a team of armed soldiers \"under extremely delicate and uncertain conditions\" and he put up a military unit of the Foreign Intelligence Service, urging them to give him the network of Romanian informers from the West. Turcu also mentioned Gelu Voican Voiculescu the famous „Turcu list” of the dignitaries who collaborated with the Securitate, stating that there is an information at the Bucharest branch of Securitate about it. Voican defended himself by stating that Liviu Turcu wants to compromise him as an active „participant in the 1989“ revolution, adding that he was not a collaborator of the Securitate, and he had no ties with it.On June 13, 2017, he was indicted alongside Ion Iliescu, Petre Roman, Virgil Magureanu and Miron Cozma for crimes against humanity, in the case of June 1990 Mineriad. The trial was suspended during the declared state of emergency following the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 10, 2020, the court decided to restart the case.In 2019 he was indicted alongside Ion Iliescu and Petre Roman for alleged crimes against humanity, in the Revolution File.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Road Apples is the eighth episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on March 12, 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are hitchhiking in the desert and play roadkill to catch a ride in the RV of the perpetually clueless couple, Mr. and Mrs. Pipe. The Pipes provide Ren and Stimpy a collection of disgusting food. Mr. Pipe warns the duo about \"the Phantom\"-a serial killer who first bores people with his tales of his show business in the 1930s and then dismembers them. \"The Phantom\" arrives who turns out to be Wilbur Cobb. Everyone fells asleep while the RV is driving. Ren wakes up, but the RV crashes into a lake. As the RV sinks to the bottom of the lake, Ren, Stimpy and Cobb escape.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMrs. Pipe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nWilbur Cobb-voice of Jack Carter\nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nHoward Baker, who directed Road Apples, joined the newly founded Games Animation studio in October 1992. Baker was one of the few Games artists who had not worked for the  Spümcø studio and was treated as outsider except by the showrunner, Bob Camp. Baker was promoted to a director by Camp in 1993. Baker recalled that directing Road Apples was a difficult experience, saying: \"I wished there was more help from the crew, who didn't want to help me for some reason. Despite the wonderful, talented artists, Games was a strange place with a lot of odd ego trips going on. I was hoping to have a longer relationship with the show, but the angst after it left Spümcø was too caustic for me\". Camp felt sorry for Jack Carter, a once prominent comedian of the 1960s who had fallen on hard times, and tried to write in the Wilbur Cobb character as often as possible to give Carter work. Camp had insisted on adding Cobb to the script of Road Apples, which other Games artists felt to be shoehorning him in, and took the story on an \"inexplicable tangent\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowksi rated Road Apples as a bomb, stating the story was entirely unfunny and unamusing. Komorowski wrote: \"Road Apples itself represents everything that went wrong in the Games era of Ren & Stimpy. The storylines took on a regular formula: downtrodden Ren and Stimpy stumble into some inescapable circumstance in which a third party takes center stage, subjecting the duo to wacky abuse that angers Ren and entertains Stimpy\".\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

Due to his bravery in combat, he was promoted to major general and brigade commander of the 478th Brigade of the 160th Division of the 66th Army. Two months later, he was ordered to lead the troops to participate in the defense of Nanjing. On 5 December, in Tangshan, outside Nanjing, he fought with the Japanese army for three hours with only one regiment left. He was shot several times, but he continued to urge his subordinates to resist the enemy without risking his own life. He bled excessively and fainted. The soldiers carried Yu Yingqi into the city of Nanjing, and were protected and rescued by doctors from the American Red Cross Drum Tower Hospital. Then he traveled to Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital via Shanghai for half a year. After treatment, the bullet was still lodged in his right knee and left numerous scars on his back, hence the name Nine-spotted Dragon. After the defense of Nanking, Chiang Kai-shek summoned Yu Yingqi to Wuhan, asked him about his injuries in the battle, and awarded him 10,000 silver dollars as a consolation. Yu Yingqi put all the money in his hometown of Baojing to establish \"Yingqi Primary School\".\nIn 1938, he was transferred to Major General of the 20th Independent Brigade and was stationed in Huizhou to fight against the Japanese on the Nanxun line in Jiangxi and Baoan in Guangdong. His goal was to intercept the enemy lines between Qingyuan and Fogang in northern Guangdong to prevent Guangzhou from falling.\nIn the autumn of 1939, he was ordered to move to the front line of Huiyang and attack the enemies on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, as well as the enemy's military strongholds, ammunition warehouses and granaries in Shenzhen, which made the Japanese army exhausted.\nFrom 1940 to 1942, Yu Yingqi went to Chongqing Army University to study in the fifth general class. In 1943, he entered the U.S. Military Officers' Tactical School in China, India and Myanmar for training. He rescued Allied pilots many times and received awards from the Allies. After graduation, he served as major general commander of the Hailufeng Garrison Area of the Republic of China. In the winter of 1944, he entered the General School Research Class of the Cadre Training Group of the Military Commission for training. In 1945, he served as major general and deputy division commander of the 209th Division of the Youth Army of the Republic of China until the end of the Anti-Japanese War.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War ===\nIn 1946, the Youth Army was demobilized, and Yu Yingqi entered the military service class of the Central Training Corps for training. After graduation, he was transferred to Major General Commander of Guangdong Hailufeng Garrison Area.\nIn 1947, he returned to Hunan from Guangdong and ran for the Hunan representative position at the National University, and was elected with a high vote. At that time, T. V. Soong was in charge of Guangdong and was appointed as the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District of Guangdong Province and the Commander of the Fifth Suppression District. More than a thousand young people from western Hunan admired him and went to Guangdong to follow Yingqi's example and enter the cadre training class. After training, the political team was engaged in intelligence, and the military team was responsible for clearing the guards of the district headquarters and the commissioner's office. At this time, the communist army in Dongjiang became increasingly active, and local security was no longer calm. After the communist army crossed the river, the National Revolutionary Army suffered successive defeats and the war situation continued to reverse. In early October, Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet at the official residence of Guangdong Provincial Chairman Xue Yue in Guangzhou. He summoned Yu and gave him face-to-face instructions on how to suppress communists. He also issued instructions to the Ministry of National Defense. Yu Yingqi was promoted to the commander-in-chief of the Fujian-Guangdong Border Region Bandit Suppression Headquarters, with the rank of lieutenant general, stationed in Songkou, Meixian County.\nFrom 1948 to 1949, he took up his post in Songkou. Less than half a year later, the national army's campaign to suppress the Communists failed successively, and the army retreated south one after another. After Hu Lien's 12th Corps broke out of the Huaihai Campaign, it moved to Guangdong and restationed in Meixian and Chaoshan areas. Yu Yingqi was ordered to hand over the task of suppressing the Communists in the area to Hu Lian's 12th Corps. Yu Yingqi's Fujian-Guangdong Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters was moved to Chao'an, leaving only one security brigade and an infantry division transferred from Taiwan by the central government, with a total strength of more than 10,000 troops. In order to undermine Yu Yingqi's prestige, the Communist Army used the incident of detaining Jieyang celebrity Wu Luxun to create public opinion in newspapers and magazines. Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily also called Yu Yingqi the \"King of Eastern Guangdong.\"\nIn 1941, when Yu Yingqi was studying at Chongqing Army University, he met Peng Siyan, a fellow student from Chongqing Jiangjin Normal College. Peng Siyan joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1938 and served as Secretary of the Baojing County Committee of the CCP in 1939. Yu Yingqi enthusiastically pursued Peng Siyan. This was the second period of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the CCP. According to the CCP's united front policy, Peng Siyan determined that Yu was the object of unity, and she agreed to marry Yu Yingqi. In 1948, Peng Siyan settled in Hong Kong and tried every means to find a party organization, and finally met Rao Zhangfeng, who later served as director of the United Front Work Department of the South China Bureau of the CCP. Rao knew all about Peng's experience and political situation, so he arranged relevant work for her. At that time, Yu Yingqi served as Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the Fujian-Guangdong Border Region. Peng Siyan traveled between Hong Kong and Chaoshan many times to collect information about the strength and equipment of the Kuomintang's Aodong troops and report to the Hong Kong underground party. She also risked her life to raise funds for the East River Column of the People's Liberation Army and assisted the party organization in instigating rebellion against Yu Yingqi.\nIn February 1949, the national situation was in complete turmoil, with inflation and financial chaos. In order to strengthen the military strength, Hu Lien's Twelfth Corps conscripted civilians in the Chaoshan area and used them as soldiers (later public opinion also attributed this account to Yu Yingqi). On 23 April, the government of the Republic of China moved the capital to Guangzhou. Wuhan fell, and the Communist army approached Guangdong along Hengyang, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou in Fujian. Yu Yingqi implemented two major methods of raising taxes. One was to allow public gambling in Shantou, and the other was to impose a per-piece escort tax on cargo loaded on incoming and outgoing ships at various river ports in eastern Guangdong. Hu Lian filed a lawsuit against the central government claiming that Yu Yingqi had allowed gambling in Shantou, and the gambling was therefore suspended. Only by relying on this escort tax can the armaments and salaries of multiple new regiments be self-sufficient. He was ordered to concurrently serve as lieutenant general and commander of the 321st Division of the Army.\nThe 321st Division evacuated Shantou on 8 October. When they arrived at Huangpu, the central government had decided to abandon Guangzhou and move to Chongqing. The troops of the 321st Division then turned around and retreated toward Leizhou Peninsula. Stationed in Shuidong Township, Dianbai County for a week to gather and replenish. The central government changed Yu Yingqi's Fujian-Guangdong Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters to the Guangdong-Guangdong East Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Yu Yingqi was appointed interim commander of the Fifth Army of the Republic of China to provide unified command for the retreat. Yu Yingqi's troops advanced in three directions to the south of Guangdong, and retreated in a unified manner along southern Guangdong. Including all the party, government, military, agencies, banks and associations in southern Guangdong; plus the small army of Bai Chongxi, the Central China governor who was defeated by Lin Biao, nearly ten thousand people also defected to Yu Yingqi. They retreated along the road and recruited local teams. When the troops arrived in Maoming County, there was a regiment of troops. Including party, government, and public education employees, the total number of troops exceeded 80,000. Under the offensive of the People's Liberation Army, on 31 October, Yu Yingqi led his troops to withdraw from Maoming County together with Wu Bin, Commissioner of the Thirteenth District, and Miao Renren, Magistrate of Maoming County. Soon, the People's Liberation Army occupied Maoming County on 2 November.\nOn 10 December, he arrived outside Lianjiang. Yu Yingqi visited Shen Fazao, commander of the Fourth Corps, who had been fighting hard for many days in Lianjiang, to discuss cooperation strategies against the enemy. Since the Communist Army was good at long night battles, the two sides agreed that all parties would hold their positions firmly that night and meet with support aircraft from Hainan Island the following morning for a joint land and air battle involving 100,000 troops. That night, because the troops had been marching for a long time and had not eaten for a long time, they asked Shen Fazao to hold a meal. Unexpectedly, during the meal, the Communist troops, who were delighted with the sneak attack at night, launched a lightning attack on the troops who were dining and surrounded the troops in an arc. And the circle is more than 40 kilometers long. Shen Fazao's 20,000 troops and Yu Yingqi's troops were caught off guard, and the whole army collapsed. Yu Yingqi was captured in Lianjiang the next day.\nAfter Yu Yingqi was captured, he was detained in Meihua Village, Dongshan, Guangzhou. The Communist Party Governor of Guangdong, Ye Jianying, and the Mayor of Guangzhou, Fang Fang, successively used conciliatory measures in the hope that Yu Yingqi would be loyal to the Communist Party, but he refused to surrender. In November 1950, Yu Yingqi was taken back to Shantou for public trial, locked in a wooden fence, and paraded through the streets. On 28 November, Yu Yingqi was shot to death by the Dongjiang People's Liberation Army. His body was exposed to the public and was not allowed to be buried. It was quietly buried by an unknown Buddhist charity a few days later. On 30 March 1951, the President of the Republic of China issued an explicit order praising Feng Zhun for entering the Martyrs' Shrine. In 1985, the Chinese Communist Party gained access to the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n《中華民國史事日誌》。\n《傳記文學》民國79年8月  第57卷第2期 145頁 ，  民國人物小傳喻英奇 。\n《潮州鄉訊》第二卷第十二期 民國三十七年(1948)8月1日 「 扣吳」与「除喻」(評論)。\n《潮州鄉訊》第二卷第十二期 民國三十七年(1948)8月1日 致陳副參議長公開信(喻英奇) ?。\n《潮州鄉訊》第七卷第五期 1950年10月16日喻英奇起解北京(特稿)。\n《潮州鄉訊》第四卷第四期 1949年4月1日 喻英奇叛變的來龍去脈。\n《潮州鄉訊》第五卷第二期 1949年9月1日 徵兵徵糧在潮汕（溫灑凡）。\n《潮州鄉訊》第七卷第八期 1950年12月1日 喻英奇成了「烈士」與「罪人」（中聲）。\n《中華民國史事日誌》1949—中華民國三十八年己丑 \"３﹐１７（二，一八）",

        "content": "William Beak  (15 January 1878 – 5 June 1966) was an Australian cattle breeder and local government politician.\nHe is best known for introducing the Poll Hereford breed of cattle into Australia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBeak was born on the family property \"Pennard\" at Mount Hedlow in 1878, and was the sixth child to his parents, Henry Beak and Essie Beak (née Matchett).\nHe attended Mount Hedlow State School, a local primary school which opened in 1880 and closed in 1920.\nAfter finishing primary school, Beak learnt cattle husbandry from his father, who founded the Henry Beak & Sons pastoral company in 1905 after acquiring a number of Central Queensland cattle stations following a severe drought. This included May Downs Station near Clermont which Beak managed in 1904.\nIn July 1908, Beak's father and mother both succumbed to influenza within a week of each other.\nBeak settled on a property called \"The Meadows\" between Nerimbera and Nankin.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Cattle breeding ===\nIn 1913, Beak purchased two \"freak\" hornless Herford bulls in an attempt to produce polled progeny.\nIn 1919, Henry Beak & Sons became the first Australian company to import Hereford cattle from the United State of America. One of the imported Herfords, Polled Gemnation, was mated with progeny from the \"freak\" hornless bulls which established the Polled Hereford breed.\nBeak is credited with helping establish the Australian Poll Hereford Breeders' Association in 1922 which later became the Australian Poll Hereford Society, becoming its patron in 1932.\nIn recognition of his work establishing the breed in Australia, Beak was elected as a life member of the American Polled Hereford Association.\nIn 1930, Beak's shipment of Poll Hereford beef to the Smithfield Markets in London received high praise, and was described as a \"serious competitor to Argentine chilled meat\" by the Corporation of London's chief meat inspector.\nIn 1936, Beak sold his property \"The Meadows\" situated between Nerimbera and Nankin to the Central Queensland Meat Export Company. Beak and his wife then relocated into Rockhampton where they moved to a house on the corner of Denham Street and Agnes Street in the suburb of The Range.\nWith an interest in stud cattle breeding and carcass judging, Beak published The Key to Divine Designs and their Guidance for the Improvement of Beef Quality in 1956, in which he endorsed the controversial theory of telegony. This was followed by 1957's Passing on more discoveries by a layman in which Beak claimed a person could judge the internal features of fat steers by tapping them with their fingers and listening for sounds.\n\n\n=== Local government and public office ===\nBeak served as a councillor on Livingstone Shire Council from 1904 to 1905, before serving on the Broadsound Shire Council from 1911 to 1919.\nHe returned to Livingstone Shire in 1919 where he again served as a councillor until 1927, six of those as the shire chairman after he was elected unopposed in 1921. He served as chairman until his defeat in 1927.\nHe again returned to Livingstone Shire Council in 1933, seeing out his last three years as a councillor, finishing up upon his defeat at the 1936 local elections.\nIn addition to his local government duties, Beak was also a chairman of the Rockhampton Harbour Board from 1924 to 1926. He also served as chairman of the Central Queensland Racing Association and as a member of the local hospital board.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nBeak married Flora McKenzie on 6 March 1913 at the homestead on Calioran Station at South Yaamba.\nBeak's wife Flora died on 26 September 1941, and was buried in the North Rockhampton Cemetery on 27 September 1941.\nBeak died in Rockhampton on 5 June 1966 and was buried in the North Rockhampton Cemetery on 7 June 1966.\nJust five days after his death, Beak was honoured in the 1966 Birthday Honours with an MBE in recognition to his service to the beef industry.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Delonegha Hot Springs are located in Kern County, California, United States, northeast of the city of Bakersfield and southeast of Glennville. Delonegha is one of several hot springs adjacent to the Kern River and State Route 178. The springs lie within the boundaries of Sequoia National Forest. Except for a brief period in the first years of the 20th century when there was a small resort at the site, the Delonegha springs have remained largely undeveloped.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe geothermally heated groundwater at Delonegha (also spelled Delonagha) was known to the indigenous people of the area, who reportedly used them \"for medicinal purposes\". The springs take their name from the Dahlonegah Mining District where gold was found in 1866. Dahlonegah was in turn named after Dahlonega, Georgia, itself the site of an early 19th-century gold rush. In the late 1860s, the first settlers of the springs district built a road to the top of Greenhorn Mountain \"to connect with Eugene and Burke Grades\" leading to Poso Flats and then into Bakersfield. A stage ran this road twice a week.Homesteader William Crawford took possession of the springs and surrounding land in 1886, and according to his daughter, \"Hot water poured out of the middle of big rocks and splashed into the river. I guess it still does. Papa built the bath house and the tubs on the edge of the river and piped water to it from a big spring up the mountain.\" The springs were remote, accessible only by a single terrible road, and the surrounding land was still almost entirely wild, and populated by native California fauna including mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, bears, rattlesnakes, and scorpions. A historian who interviewed Crawford's daughter Mae in 1965 wrote that \"Miners and homesteaders stopped by occasionally. Most took baths in the bath house built by Mr. Crawford, soaking in the concrete tub filled with hot spring water, then lying, blanket-wrapped, on the sweat-board for an hour or so. Some bought cheese, goat's milk, and goat meat, and the family income was further augmented by the sale of the tough little burros to sheepherders.\" After the Kern River flooded out the Crawford family for the third time, William Crawford \"mortgaged the Springs to H. H. Fish, the man he was driving a hack for in Bakersfield, so he'd have the money to repair things with\".  When Crawford defaulted on the mortgage, Fish evicted the family from the land. Fish then leased Delonegha to Simeon and Dell Hill in about 1898. The Hills built \"a hotel, boarding house, several dwellings, and a bath,\" and the resort flourished for a time, particularly in 1905 and 1906. According to a history of Kern County, \"Hotel guests paid by the week, ate at the boardinghouse and bathed in the effervescent waters of the mineral springs. In spring, the hillsides around the resort blazed with orange poppies, blue lupine, and stately waxen yuccas. The thick trees and mountain shrubs shaded the resort from the summer sun and in the damp, shadowed places near the springs grew a multitude of violets.\" However, in 1905, a new road was constructed between Bodfish and Democrat Hot Springs that bypassed Delongha and, over time, their resort business collapsed. A young visitor who was there in 1909 later recalled \"the steep ride down the mountain from the cow camp to the Springs, the handsome hotel with wide, shaded verandas, and the bustle of guests.\" However, business was already in decline and the hotel closed by 1912.\nLocal historians who visited the site in 1956 found that \"several dwellings remain intact and a small bathhouse is all that remains of the 'curative' pools, but the picturesque swinging footbridge across the Kern River that charmed a generation of years ago still spans the river, sturdy and exciting. Another item of nostalgia was the discovery of signs posted on nearby boulders in the heyday of the springs by early merchants in Bakersfield: the Toggery, Hochheimer's Department Store, Harrington's and C. N. Johnston's Blacksmith Shop, businesses that faded from the Bakersfield scene long ago.\"As of 1967, the property was owned by B. N. Kershaw but was \"not at present open to the public\". Today, springs lie within the boundaries of the Sequoia National Forest, and the old bath tubs were destroyed by U.S. Forest Service as a public safety measure in June 1977.\n\n\n== Water profile ==\nAccording to a U.S. government geologist in 1915, \"At the western edge of Kern River, about 6 miles below the Clear Creek Springs, is a group of three hot springs that are called after a prospector named Delonegha. These springs issue a few feet above the river surface from crevices in fractured, massive granite. The water is distinctly sulphureted, but it does not seem to be otherwise notably mineralized. In 1908 there was a resort here, consisting of a small hotel and two bathhouses. The flow of two of the springs was collected in cement basins and used in the bathhouses, which were perched on the rocks above the river. The third spring issues too close to the river to be easily available.\" A geothermal research project sponsored by NOAA found that the temperature of Delonegha water is 44 °C (111 °F) when it emerges from the source. Flow rate is approximately 95 liters per minute.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMiracle Hot Springs\nRemington Hot Springs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Home Safety Hotline is a 2024 video game developed by Night Signal Entertainment for Windows. The game is a horror-themed puzzle title in which players provide customer service for the Home Safety Hotline, locating and providing callers with the correct information on ordinary and supernatural household hazards. Creation of the game was led by independent developer Nick Lives, who created the game as an inspiration of the bestiaries from Dungeons and Dragons and the mythology of legendary creatures. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews, with praise directed to the uniqueness of the game's concept, visual presentation and narrative, with some critiques about the game's length and challenge level.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nHome Safety Hotline takes place on a simulation of a fictitious operating system. On the desktop, players can read emails, watch videos, and begin a shift operating the titular Home Safety Hotline. Players clock into shifts using the Hotline menu, where they take calls from the Hotline and hear audio clips from callers describing a household problem, and provide the appropriate response from a list of hazards from the menu. If the player provides a caller with an incorrect response, they will receive a returning call depicting the outcome of the player's failure to resolve a problem. The percentage of correct guesses is provided to the player at the end of a shift, although if players fall short of a number of correct guesses they will receive a disciplinary call, and if they continue to answer incorrectly, they will be terminated and the game will end. Players unlock more listed hazards over time. As the game progresses, the Hotline will begin to encounter network errors, which disrupt the players access to information about the various hazards. Upon completion of the game, players are able to access an art book created by the developer, featuring concept art and background information on the game's creation.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in 1996, players are recruited to be a responder on the Home Safety Hotline, a service that responds to callers enquiring about household hazards by providing safety instructions. They are onboarded by Carol, their manager. At first, callers report ordinary household annoyances, including household pests such as cockroaches and mice. The Hotline also receives prank calls and unrelated enquiries. Over the player's shifts, more supernatural hazards begin to be reported by callers including household Hobbs, boggarts and nymphs. After a number of days, the Hotline corporate invites the player character to undertake a trial as part of a process named the \"descension\", in which riddles are presented to the player. If the player is successful, Carol contacts the player and informs them they have received a promotion, transporting them to a forest, revealing herself to be a fae and crowning them as the new Junior Supervisor of the Home Safety Hotline.\n\n\n== Development ==\nHome Safety Hotline was created by Night Signal Entertainment, the studio of independent developer Nick Lives. Lives stated that the game aimed to recapture the experience of reading through the fictional bestiaries of the Monster Manual of the Dungeons and Dragons series of role-playing games. Following a series of abandoned prototypes, Lives revisited the concept upon discovering the analog horror subgenre, and decided to create a game under the working title The Lunar Archives inspired by the aesthetic of \"90s media formats\" including the user interface of the Windows 95 operating system. The monsters included in the game were a mixture of Lives' own creation and existing mythological entities, with additional inspiration from the SCP Foundation series of fiction and the horror artwork of Trevor Henderson Eduardo Valdés-Hevia. Lives created imagery for the game by importing source photography into Photoshop and transforming them into digital paintings, exporting the imagery at a reduced level of quality to meet the 90s aesthetic for the game. Home Safety Hotline was announced alongside the release of a demo in June 2023 at the Steam Next Fest, and showcased in late 2023 at the DreadXP Indie Horror Showcase and the Double Fine Day of the Devs. The game was released on Steam on 17 January 2024. Following release, the developers released an update to the game introducing a new \"endless score-based game mode\" titled Call Trainer unlocked after the completion of the main game.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nHome Safety Hotline was received with \"generally favorable\" reviews upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's visual presentation. Edge stated the game's interface, citing its \"grainy\" videos, \"green-tinged images\" and \"crackly sounds\" were a \"potent setting for horror\" and evocative of a \"haunted quality\". Describing the title as \"analog horor at its finest, Aaron Boehm of Bloody Disgusting enjoyed the game's \"stylistic flourishes\" and \"well-done\" videos. Kyle Leclair commended the presentation and interface to have a \"perfectly-captured old-school PC feel\", praising its \"low-tech\" simplicity as allowing the focus of the game to be on its narrative. Cass Marshall of Polygon found the subtle distortions of the interface and sound effectively conveyed a \"strong sense of wrongness and unease\" and helped \"ratchet up the tension.\nReviewers generally praised the game's horror concept and narrative. Cass Marshall of Polygon highlighted the game's \"deliciously unsettling\" and \"very effective\" premise, citing the reliance on \"slow, creeping realizations\" about the \"perfectly off and disturbing\" experiences of individual callers. Kyle Leclair of Hardcore Gamer commended the game's \"black comedy\" and \"stellar writing\", finding it to feature \"cleverly-designed supernatural phenomena\" and strike \"a perfect balance between comedy and horror\". Joshua Wolens of PC Gamer enjoyed the game's tone, stating that its \"off-kilter banality\" was \"well-done\". Whilst Aaron Boehm of Bloody Disgusting highlighted the game's \"clever\" concept and \"unique style and tone\", he also considered some of the narrative elements to be short of \"compelling or cohesive\" and did not \"connect in some way that revealed something about the world at large\". Similarly, Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun praised the \"brilliant framing\" and \"excellent\" writing style of the game's index entries, but found various plot threads to end unresolved.\nSeveral reviewers noted the gameplay's scope and difficulty were limited. Edge commented that the game had \"modest parameters\" and may have benefited from more \"mechanical variety\". Kyle Leclair of Hardcore Gamer noted that the game lacked challenge and was \"relatively short in length\", finding the difficulty to decrease over time due to the unique qualities of the supernatural entities. Aaron Boehm of Bloody Disgusting found the gameplay loop to be \"relatively simple\" and wished it had \"more polish\", stating that the game lacked features such as searchable terms or direct feedback on whether the player provided a successful answer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHome Safety Hotline at MobyGames",

        "content": "Bass Masters is the eighth episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on February 19, 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are the hosts of a sports games show, Bass Masters. The duo go fishing for the Foul-Mouthed Bass. Wilbur Cobb escapes from the prison where he is introduced in Stimpy's Cartoon Show. Cobb poses as the \"Indian guide\" for Ren and Stimpy's fishing trip on the lake. Ren fails to capture any fish while Stimpy captures hundreds of fish. Stimpy says he can \"speak fish\". Albert the Foul Mouthed Bass arrives to criticize Ren for not speaking fish. Ren jumps into the lake to learn the language of fish and is promptly eaten by Albert who tells Ren is \"the dumb bass\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nWilbur Cobb-voice of Jack Carter\nFish-voice of Bob Camp\nAlbert the Foulmouthed Bass-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was written in 1992 at the Spümcø studio by John Kricfalusi and Richard Pursel for the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. After Spümcø lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, the episode was assigned to the Games Animation studio, who held it over for the third season owning to production delays. The director of Bass Masters, Bob Camp changed the story by shoehorning in the character of Wilbur Cobb who was not in the Spümcø script. The voice for Cobb was provided by Jack Carter, a prominent comedian of the 1950-1960s who was struggling financially in his old age. Bill Wray of Games Animation stated: \"Cobb worked well for one cartoon when you first saw him. But Bob felt sorry for Jack, so he would cast him in as many cartoons as possible. So in a way there were two or three cartoons where he was just shoehorned in, just so Jack could get some work\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode an unfavorable review, writing that the story was unfunny and that Wilbur Cobb was an unnecessary addition to the story.  \n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Osvaldo Paladini (26 December 1866 – 25 March 1938) was an Italian admiral who served in the Regia Marina from 1882 to 1930. He took part in the Italo-Turkish War, where he was commander of the Red Sea Naval Division, commanding the Piemonte during the Battle of Kunfuda Bay. For this he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy. Promoted to Rear-Admiral during the World War I, he first commanded the Battle Division, and in 1918 the 3rd Naval Squadron. On 2 October 1918, he was awarded the title of Commander of the Military Order of Savoy and the honor of Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy.\n\n\n== Early military career ==\nOsvaldo was born on 26 December 1866 at San Marco Argentano where his father worked as a surveyor. In 1882 he enlisted in the Regia Marina, beginning to attend the Italian Naval Academy of Livorno from which he graduated with the rank of midshipman. He embarked successively on the battleships Italia, Sardegna and the ironclad steamer San Martino and from 1899 and 1900, he served within torpedo boats.As a lieutenant he distinguished himself for the design of a percussion ignition device for medium-caliber guns, being declared suitable for naval artillery service. In 1904, he was promoted to corvette captain, assumed command of the destroyer Aquilone, and was awarded the honour of Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. Serving as the commander of the battleship Vittorio Emanuele, in 1908 he received the bronze medal for Civil Valour for the relief brought to the populations of Reggio Calabria and Messina affected by the 1908 Messina earthquake.Promoted to frigate captain in 1909, in April 1911, on the eve of the Italo-Turkish War, he assumed command of the protected cruiser Piemonte, carrying out exploratory assignments in the Red Sea between Aden and Djibouti, and sending a report to the Ministry of the Navy on the socio-economic conditions of those areas and on the meetings with the local authorities, proposing to the Ministry suitable initiatives for future commercial settlements. In the same year the Bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society published an account of a trip to Nairobi and the French Congo.\n\n\n== Italo-Turkish War ==\nA few months after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, he became the protagonist of a feat that brought him widespread notoriety thanks also to an illustration by Achille Beltrame in the Domenica del Corriere. Upon victory at the Battle of Kunfuda Bay on 7 January 1912, he would send a telegram at 5:15 p.m. consisting of the following:\n\nCruiser Piedmont, destroyer Garibaldino and Artigliere encountered seven Turkish gunboats and an armed yacht. In spite of good Turkish artillery, our ships annihilated gunboats, captured yachts, and took part in the enemy's guns, flags, and trophies of war.\nThe action earned him the honors of Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy and Knight of the Military Order of Savoy because \"he directed and coordinated the search for enemy gunboats in locations fraught with hydrographic difficulties, he prepared and conducted the action with promptness and perfect military criteria\". Commander of the Maritime Defense of Messina, he was promoted to captain in 1913, and assumed command of the battleship Roma.\n\n\n== World War I ==\nDuring the years of the First World War he was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1917, commanding the Roma, before assuming command first of the Battle Division, and in 1918 of the 3rd Naval Squadron, also carrying out orders as Commander of Defense of the Regia Marina and director general of the Maritime Military Arsenal of Taranto. On 2 October 1918 he directed the attack on an Austro-Hungarian naval base in Durrës, earning the title of Commander of the Military Order of Savoy and, for his participation in the war, the honour of Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy.\n\n\n== Later military career ==\nAfter the end of the war he served as Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces in Albania in 1919 before holding the position of Maritime Military Commander of Ancona in 1920. In 1921, Paladini would get into the fishing industry as a profound connoisseur. In 1920, he was placed in the naval reserve, and in 1923 he was appointed Vice Admiral of the squadron and in 1926 he reached the rank of Squadron Admiral. Paladini retired on 26 December 1930 before dying on 25 March 1938 in Rome and his body was buried in the Campo Verano.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOrder of the Crown of Italy, Knight (9 June 1904)\nBronze Medal for Civil Valor for the relief of the populations of the earthquake of 1908 (28 December 1908)\nCommemorative Medal for the Italo-Turkish War 1911–1912\nOrder of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, Knight (30 May 1912)\nMilitary Order of Savoy, Knight (16 March 1913)\nOrder of the Crown of Italy, Officer (29 May 1913)\nOrder of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, Officer (23 September 1916)\nMilitary Order of Savoy, Commander (2 February 1919)\nOrder of the Crown of Italy, Commander (27 June 1920)\nAllied Victory Medal (Italy) (16 December 1920)\nCommemorative Medal of the Unity of Italy (19 January 1922)\nCross for Seniority of Military Service (40 years)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Biliography ===\nAlberini, Paolo; Prosperini, Franco (2015).

        "content": "The Wai-iti Dark Sky Park is an accredited International Dark Sky Park, located near the township of Wakefield in the Tasman District of New Zealand. It covers an area of 135 ha (330 acres) of Tasman District Council land, including Tunnicliff Forest and the Wai-iti Recreation Reserve. Wai-iti is the first International Dark Sky Park to be designated in New Zealand by DarkSky International.The park is located around 4 km (2.5 mi) from Wakefield, and 33 km (21 mi) from Nelson, and is adjacent to the Wai-iti River.The application for the dark sky park status was prepared by the Top of the South Dark Sky committee, a group associated with the Nelson Science Society Astronomy Section. Accreditation was announced in July 2020. The application reported that readings of night sky luminance in the park taken over a period of 5 years have a average value of 21.52 mag/arcsec2 (corresponding to Bortle scale 3), with a few individual readings of 21.84 mag/arcsec2 (Bortle scale 1).In July 2023, the Top of the South Dark Sky Committee warned the District Council that the Dark Sky Park accreditation was at risk because there had been a 150% increase in light pollution in the park over a period of three years. Factors leading to the increase in light pollution were thought to include the expansion of residential and industrial subdivisions within 25 km (16 mi) of the park, increasing street lighting, and the use of 4000k LED street lights. At the time of the application for accreditation, the District Council had agreed to a lighting management plan, but as of 2023, this had not been implemented. The advocates for the Dark Sky Park urged that luminaires in sensitive areas be refitted with 2200K amber phosphorus LEDs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Leng Xin (7 November 1900 – 6 February 1987), courtesy name Rong'an, was a Chinese lieutenant general and politician of the Republic of China.\n\n\n== Life ==\nXin was born in Xinghua, Jiangsu, on 11 November 1900. In 1944, he served as Director of the Military Affairs Department of the Chinese Army Headquarters and Lieutenant General Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army Headquarters in the Chinese Theater. After the war, he was awarded the Third Class Medal of Honor, the Medal of Loyalty and Diligence and the American Medal of Freedom. The first batch of graduates from Huangpu School.\n\n\n== Surrender of Zhijiang ==\nAt the Zhijiang surrender ceremony on 21 August 1945, Allied representative Xiao Yisu was in the center, Leng Xin was on the left, and Brigadier General Bodno, Chief of Staff of the US Army China Theater Combat Command, was on the right. The Japanese representative was Takeo Imai, who represented the Japanese commander Yasuji Okamura. On 9 September, Leng Xin presented Japan's letter of surrender to the commander-in-chief of the Chinese theater, Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n== Family ==\nIn the spring of 1947, in order to show that he would never forget his mother's upbringing, he returned to his hometown to bury his late mother. When he visited a teacher, he learned that Xinghua's education was backward, so he planned to establish Xinghua \"Private Nianyi Middle School\" to benefit his hometown.\n\n\n== In Taiwan ==\nIn September 1959, he retired with the rank of Army Lieutenant General. After retiring, he became active in the field of historical research. After 1964, he was appointed as a professor at Soochow University and Chinese Culture University, teaching modern history. Many of Taiwan's contemporary historians have deep friendships with him. He studies modern history, because many historical facts are based on personal experience, and there are many first-hand historical materials and original opinions, which are extremely authoritative. Therefore, he was appointed as a part-time lecturer at the National Defense Research Institute, and was appointed as Huagang Professor (tenured professor) at the Cultural University. In addition to the hourly fee, he also received a monthly research fee of 10,000 yuan as a courtesy, which Leng Xin was proud of.

        "content": "Sahyadrimetrus scaber is a species of scorpion endemic to India. It's common name is South Indian scorpion.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSahyadrimetrus scaber is distinguished by its vaulted carapace with steep lateral surfaces, converging margins posteriorly, granular interocular surface, granular posterolateral surfaces in females, short pedipalps in adult males, absence of dorsomedian patella carina in females, smooth intercarinal surfaces of chela manus in females, and specific setae morphology on leg basitarsi. It also exhibits granular mesosomal tergites and smooth ventral intercarinal surfaces of metasomal segment IV. Dorsolateral carinae of metasomal segment V are distinct and continuous.\n\n\n== Range ==\nSahyadrimetrus scaber is endemic to southern India. Specifically it has been recorded in Kerala, Karnataka and Goa.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nSahyadrimetrus scaber along with S.kanarensis are found to be occasionally harvested for exotic pet trade.\n\n\n== Venom ==\n\nSahyadrimetrus scaber venom exhibits low toxicity compared to other scorpion species. Its venom primarily causes local effects, unlike more potent neurotoxins found in species like Tityus and Centruroides. S. scaber venom contains various enzymes like acid phosphatase and ribonuclease, but lacks proteolytic activity. It also contains indole compounds, including 5-hydroxytryptamine, contributing to intense local pain. When administered, sublethal doses induce hyperglycemia in rabbits possibly due to increased adrenaline production. The toxic protein isolated from S.scaber venom is a glycoprotein with no enzyme activity, causing mortality in rats at a dose of 0.72 mg/kg when intravenously administered. However, it is less toxic compared to the venom of more dangerous scorpion species. There is ongoing research to understand its pharmacological actions. S.scaber is venomous to humans but poses lower risk compared to other poisonous scorpions.\n\n\n== References ==",

It peaked at No. 14 in the Polish top albums chart.\n\n\n== About ==\nLuna's album debut is her emotional portrait, an attempt to capture her feelings, complicated emotions, and, above all, the complexity of fear.  The title track of the album - \"Nocne zmory\" - was the fourth composition that the artist prepared for her album. – I knew right away that this song would be the leitmotif of the entire album. \"Nightmares\" was such a broad term for me, so symbolic and emotional, that it encompassed all my fears, says Luna. She emphasizes that \"night terrors\" are not only fears but also unfulfilled dreams, too high expectations, inappropriate desires and ambitions, love disappointments, and unrealities that we create ourselves and cannot get rid of. – Night terrors are not visible at first glance, because they lie deep inside us.Luna says that \"Nocne zmory\" is a forest song. – When I was writing it, an image of a cold and wet forest that pierces us from the inside came to my mind – says the artist. The song is accompanied by a minimalist, but refined in every detail, a video in which the main role is played by bodies spinning in dance. – The music video is organic and has a pure form because I didn't want to add any meaning to this story. Therefore, everyone can interpret it in their way. There is no single key here. The clip is sensual, close to the body, and in bright colors - adds Luna.According to Luna, she wrote this album about her fears:\n\nIt was while writing the description of the album that I realized that the material on the album was very personal and filled with me. On the other hand, when writing the songs, I did not talk about myself, but rather about my emotional states - fears. Night terrors are subcutaneous, unconscious fears. There are no events from my life here, no \"heartbroken\" experiences. The creative process was interesting for me because, contrary to appearances, it was not self-therapy. I created a completely different world. My stories are dictated by my imagination, my dreams, and not reality - how I am every day. That's why working on the album was so fascinating. It didn't make me tired, it didn't exhaust me emotionally. It's all because of this element of creation, not talking about my life, about myself.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll the songs are written by Luna and Hotel Torino (Dominic Buczkowski-Wojtaszek and Patryk Kumór), otherwise stated. \n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Personel ==\nAleksandra Katarzyna \"Ola\" Wielgomas (Luna) - vocals, writer (tracks 1–15)\nDominic Buczkowski-Wojtaszek - producer, writer (tracks 1–15)\nPatryk Kumór - producer, writer (tracks 1–15)\nJan Bielecki - producer (track 13), writer (track 13)\nBoleslaw Lesmian - writer (tracks 1 & 15)\nMichał Szczygieł - writer (track 13)\nSaszan - writer (track 13)\nThomas Leithead-Dochery - writer (track 10)\n\n\n== References ==",

The vehicle is planned to be reusable and will utilize next generation nuclear thermal propulsion technology, to be demonstrated in 2027.\n\n\n== History ==\nUtilizing nuclear energy for space travel reportedly has been discussed since the 1950s. Industry experts such as Freeman Dyson and Ted Taylor through their involvement in Project Orion aimed to create an early demonstration of the technology. Ultimately, the project received backing from Wernher von Braun, and reached the test flight stage of development, the project ended early due to environmental concerns.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nTabitha Dodson, DARPA program manager for DRACO says: “Unlike today’s chemical systems, which have reached a limit in how far they can evolve, nuclear technologies are theorized to evolve to systems such as fusion and beyond,” she says. “Spacecraft evolved to be maneuvered and powered by nuclear reactors will enable humanity to go farther, with a higher chance of survival and success for any mission type.”In the DRACO program, responsibilities include: \n\nGeneral Dynamics: Design of the NTP reactor including a blueprint for a propulsion subsystem\nBlue Origin and Lockheed Martin: design of the spacecraft, including the fission reactor which would use a special high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU).According to Lockheed, there are considerable efficiency and time gains from the in development DRACO vehicle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDARPA\nNuclear Thermal Rocket\n2027 in spaceflight\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that one-time construction grants to religious colleges and universities under Title I of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 do not violate the Establishment or Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment. Applying the effect prong of the Lemon test, the Court severs and strikes down one provision of the Act that limited enforcement of secular use restrictions to a 20-year period.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTitle I of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 provided construction grants limited to buildings and facilities that were \"exclusively for secular educational, purposes\".Federal taxpayers filed a lawsuit challenging five projects at four church-related colleges in Connecticut. The district court found that the act was constitutional.\n\n\n== Supreme Court ==\nIn a split 5-4 decision the Court upheld the constitutionality of the federal construction grants under the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses. Tilton was decided on the same day as Lemon v. Kurtzman and the Lemon criteria were applied for the Establishment question.\n\n\n=== Plurality decision ===\nWriting for the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger explained that theLemon criteria were \"guidelines with which to identify instances in which the objectives of the Religion Clauses have been impaired\".They found that the act had a legitimate secular purpose to accommodate \"rapidly growing\" numbers of students pursuing higher education. Citing Bradfield v. Roberts, Everson, Allen and Walz they rejected appellants \"simplistic argument\" that the Establishment Clause requires a blanket ban on financial aid to religious organizations: \"The crucial question is not whether some benefit accrues to a religious institution as a consequence of the legislative program, but whether its principal or primary effect advances religion\".In upholding the constitutionality of most of the federal statute, the court relied on the district court's finding that none of the schools involved in the Tilton case had violated the § 751(a)(2) restrictions prohibited the display of religious symbols and non-secular activities in federally funded buildings. In Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen the Court upheld a New York state law that provided textbook loans to parochial school students. In that case the Court would not assume that \"religiosity in parochial elementary and secondary schools necessarily permeates the secular education that they provide\" without evidence.The only provision that presented an Establishment concern was § 754(b)(2) placing a 20-year limit on enforceability of the recipient's obligations to not use the facility for religious instruction or worship: \"The restrictive obligations of a recipient institution...cannot, compatibly with the Religion Clauses, expire while the building has substantial value\". This provision was severed.The Court said inTilton that the \"minimal\" inspections required to enforce compliance with secular use restrictions will not result in excessive entanglements between government and religious authorities. College students \"are less impressionable and less susceptible to religious indoctrination\". The program does not subsidize teachers like the statutes in Lemon. The entanglement that would result from government surveillance over teachers would be excessive. There is less entanglement with a one-time construction grant than continuing payments of teacher salaries that require audits of school expenditures.The Court did not find there was any coercion directed to religious belief or activity that would infringe the Free Exercise rights of taxpayers.\n\n\n== Notelist ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Of the fifty elected members of National Assembly, two seats belong to the bloc.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe alliance was part of the opposition bloc elected on February 2012. After the annulment of the February 2012 session and the change of the electoral system, the alliance boycotted the following two elections on December 2012 and 2013. On 20 April 2016, they announced their intention to stop boycotting in the next election. On the 2020 election, three members of the alliance, Mohammed Hayef al-Mutairi, Bader Al-Dahoum and Osama Al-Menawer, won seats in the National Assembly. In March 2021, Bader Al-Dahoum’s membership in parliament was annulled by the constitutional court. The alliance’s efforts led to the segregation between the two sexes in Kuwait University on 2023.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The system will be constructed and operated by Chennai Metro Rail Limited. The stations will be at-grade and the line is planned to link the existing urban transit lines of Chennai Metro and Chennai Mass Rapid Transit System.\nThe system will be designed as per MoHUA's Metrolite specifications and will be cheaper to construct because of its lower speeds and carrying capacities compared to regular metros. In 2023, the feasibility study for the project was commissioned by the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority.\n\n\n== References ==",

Of whom, an 18-year-old student of English Philology at the University of Murcia, Patricia López, was named the first Miss Grand Murcia.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Murcia's annual editions since 2018.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Murcia representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) is a branch of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. It is tasked with managing over 1,350 recreation sites and 800 trails across the province of British Columbia, Canada. These sites and trails are part of a unique network offering safe and enjoyable public recreation opportunities for both residents and visitors from around the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of RSTBC can be traced back to 1939 when the British Columbia Forest Service established a Parks Division to manage public recreation on Crown land. After several transformations and the involvement of various ministries, the responsibility for these recreation sites and trails was assigned to the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations.\n\n\n== Mission and Operations ==\nRSTBC's mission is to enhance outdoor recreation opportunities and experiences by managing a sustainable network of recreation sites and trails. The management of these sites includes promoting environmental stewardship, public safety, and the educational values of outdoor recreation.\nRSTBC delivers its programs through a headquarters in Victoria, four regional offices, and 19 district offices across the province.

        "content": "The Kokubu Tile Kiln ruins (国分瓦窯跡, Kokubu kawara gama ato) is an archaeological site with the ruins of a Nara period kiln, located in the city of  Dazaifu, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1922.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nKawara (瓦) roof tiles made of fired clay were introduced to Japan from Baekche during the 6th century along with Buddhism. During the 570s under the reign of Emperor Bidatsu, the king of Baekche sent six people to Japan skilled in various aspects of Buddhism, including a temple architect. Initially, tiled roofs were a sign of great wealth and prestige, and used for temple and government buildings. The material had the advantages of great strength and durability, and could also be made at locations around the country wherever clay was available.\nThe Kokubu Tile Kiln ruins are located approximately 200 meters northeast of the Chikuzen Kokubun-ji ruins. More than nine noborigama-style kilns were built in a valley, but during the Edo period a dam was built and submerged the site. Two of the kilns have been excavated and were found to be 1.5 meters high, 5.5 meters deep, and 1.5 meters wide, and to be constructed of sun-dried bricks. It is constructed in an arched manner  and finished by painting clay on top. The kilns date from the Nara period, and were made to supply the roof tiles necessary for the construction of the adjacent Chikuzen Kokubun-ji monastery and Chikuzen Kokubun-niji nunnery as well as the temple of Kanzeon-ji. The tiles had a similar pattern to those which have been excavated from the Heijō Palace site.\nThe site is approximately a 15-minute walk from Tofurōmae Station on the Nishitetsu Tenjin Ōmuta Line; however, the kiln remains have been backfilled and are lso located under the surface of the reservoir.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCutural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism web (in Japanese)\nDazaifu Heritage (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Xanthosia scopulicola is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales. It is an ascending perennial subshrub with trifoliate juvenile leaves, later egg-shaped leaves with wavy edges, and white flowers in a compound umbel with 2 or 3 rays with up to 4 flowers in each ray.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthosia scopulicola is an ascending, perennial subshrub that typically grows to a height of up to 20 cm (7.9 in) and is covered with star-shaped, woolly hairs. Its juvenile leaves are trifoliate, the leaflets egg-shaped, the end leaflet 5–20 mm (0.20–0.79 in) long and 5–25 mm (0.20–0.98 in) wide, the edges wavy. Adults leaves are similar in size and dimensions to the end leaflet of juvenile leaves. The flowers are arranged in a compound umbel on a peduncle 5–25 mm (0.20–0.98 in) long, with 2 or 3 rays, each with up to 4 flowers per ray. There are petal-like yellow involucral bracts 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long at the base of the flowers. The sepals are 1.0–1.2 mm (0.039–0.047 in) long and the petals are white, 1.0–1.2 mm (0.039–0.047 in) long. Flowering occurs from November to January.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nXanthosia scopulicola was first formally described in 2000 by J.M.Hart and Murray J. Henwood in Australian Systematic Botany, from specimens collected on the Giant Stairway. The specific epithet (scopulicola) refers to the species' preference for cliff habitats.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of xanthosia is restricted to the Jamison Valley, where it grows in cracks and crevices of sandstone cliff faces or roocky outcrops above the cliffs.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nXanthosia scopulicola is listed as \"vulnerable\" under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species are habitat degradation, urban runoff and lack of information about its distribution.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Margaret Crawford is an urban planner, architectural historian and professor at the University of Berkeley. \nShe is a specialist in urban development in the United States and China, and she is one of the leading experts on the urban and social transformations of the suburbs in North America. In her studies, Crawford emphasizes the new uses and revitalization that these suburban areas have seen in recent decades, which is leading to a territorial rebalancing with respect to city centres, historically the main focal points of urban life. She has co-edited various monographs, including two editions of Everyday Urbanism (with John Chase and John Kaliski, The Monacelli Press, 1999 and 2008), which introduced and consolidated the concept of everyday urbanism, and Urbanization in China (with Marco Cenzatti, Routledge, 2017). She collaborated on the books Making Suburbia: New Histories of Everyday America (University Of Minnesota Press, 2015) and The Suburb Reader (Routledge, 2006). She is also the author of the book Building the Workingman's Paradise: The History of American Company Towns (Verso, 1995), a study of towns built by companies and factories to house workers from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries, and The Car and the City: Automobile, The Built Environment and Daily Urban Life (The University of Michigan Press, 1991). She was awarded with a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "9-Oxodecenoic acid (9-oxo-2(E)-decenoic acid, also called 9-ODA) is an unsaturated ketocarboxylic or fatty acid and a pheromone secreted by the queen bee of the honeybee species Apis mellifera. It functions as a sex attractant that stimulates the olfactory receptors of male drones. Additionally, this acid plays a crucial role in regulating the colony's social structure; it inhibits the development of ovaries in worker bees, which are sterile females. However, its inhibitory effect on the worker bees' ovaries is only fully effective when combined with another pheromone, 9-hydroxydecenoic acid. When the queen bee is removed from the hive, the worker bees initiate the construction of new queen cells and the previously inhibited drones develop functional ovaries. The exact biological mechanisms through which 9-oxodecenoic acid and related substances influence these processes are not fully understood, but they are thought to affect the nervous system in some way.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\n9-Oxodecenoic acid can be synthesized starting from azelaic acid.An efficient synthesis is possible starting from diethyl-3-oxoglutarate. This is alkylated by 6-bromo-1-hexene and magnesium ethanolate, then decarboxylated. The double bond is oxidized to the aldehyde with osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate in aqueous tert-butanol. The acid group is introduced by condensation with malonic acid.\n\n\n== References ==",

She served as President of the Florida State Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and the first Treasurer of the Professional Photographers' Association of Florida.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMinnie Elnora Neal was born at Gallipolis, Ohio. Her parents were John C. and Fannie R. (Farrand) Neal.\nShe was educated in the public schools of Terre Haute, Indiana, graduating from the high school in that city, and leading the class in general proficiency.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNeal enlisted early in the temperance cause. Removing to Florida, she was elected corresponding secretary of the Florida WCTU in 1893. In 1901, she became vice-president, and in 1904, was chosen president of that organization. At that time, there were but 35 Unions in the State, and about 600 members. Fourteen years later (1918), there were 175 Unions and a listed membership of 3,540.\nNeal, although in business as a photographer in Jacksonville contrived to spend considerable time at Tallahassee each winter when the Legislature was in session. The better elements of the population learned to rely on her as a shrewd and successful promoter of reform legislation. Besides her temperance work, Neal was active in church and missionary movements; and, during World War I, took a leading part in the activities of the Florida Women's Committee of National Defense.\nFor several years, Neal served as secretary of the Florida Christian Endeavor Union and was the editor of its State paper. She was the Governor for Florida of the American Woman's Republic. Neal was a member of the American Woman's League, Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, and the Equal Suffrage Club.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn religion, she was Presbyterian.\nMinnie E. Neal died in Jacksonville, Florida, August 29, 1945.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antônio Pedroso de Barros (died 1652) was a bandeirante, he was the brother of the bandeirante Pedro Vaz de Barros.\nHe died in 1652 with a will. He was boosted by the number of 600 Indians he had on his farms.\nIn 1650, there were already many farms in the region known as Caioçara, a name preserved to this day. The Caioçara de Jarinu and Atibaia neighborhoods are confined. The bandeirantes, going around the Cangica hill to the left, would have reached the highland where the Campo Largo station building on the Bragantina Railway was built. Nearby was the prosperous farm of Antônio Pedroso de Barros and from this property the movements leading to the exploration of the region began.\nThe appearance of the town of Atibaia dates back to 1665. In 1653, in the inventory of Antônio Pedroso de Barros, the boundaries of the region called Caioçara appear, whose lands today belong partly to the municipality of Jarinu and partly to Atibaia.\nIn the lands located before Juqueri (today Caieiras, Francisco Morato, Franco da Rocha and Mairiporã), for those leaving São Paulo, there were properties of Notable bandeirantes such as Antônio Pedroso de Alvarenga, Brás Cardoso, Paulo Pereira, Pedro Fernandes, Mateus Luís Grou, Francisco Rodrigues Velho and his brothers and other sertanistas .\nHis life is narrated in March to the West, a book by Cassiano Ricardo, where the author states: \"Other pioneers heading west and northwest were the Pedroso (Pedroso Xavier and Pedroso de Barros). Antônio Pedroso de Barros and Luís Pedroso de Barros, two brothers, penetrated the west of Mato Grosso by river, the first carrying a flag with 500 Indians and the second 1,200.\"\nThe flags were entire families. And the Mato Grosso flags were among the ones that fought the hardest: the objective was very distant and the indigenous tribes were among the most fierce and fearless. Through the rivers Tietê, Paraná, Pardo, Coxim and Taquari, 520 leagues had to be covered. And the Indians were the paiaguás and the guaicurus, the first were lords of the rivers (\"fish Indians\") and the second were the famous horse Indians. The \"paiaguás were the walls closing the mines of Cuiabá\" and \"terrible bugs, the more they killed, the more they wanted to kill\".\nSilva Leme tells about his family in Genealogia Paulistana. As stated in his inventory with will (Notary of Officials of São Paulo), he died in 1652, his will being written by his brother-in-law Francisco Dias Velho, as the testator was in death. In it he declared that he was the son of Luzia Leme, that he was the brother of captains Fernão Pais de Barros and Pedro Vaz de Barros, and that he was the son-in-law of Inês Monteiro de Alvarenga.\n\n\n== Marriage and posterity ==\nIn 1639 in São Paulo, he married Maria Pires de Medeiros, daughter of captain Salvador Pires de Medeiros and Inês Monteiro de Alvarenga, nicknamed \"the matron\". He left four legitimate children and four bastards:\nLegitimate children:\n\nPedro Vaz de Barros – born 10 April 1644 in São Paulo\nAntônio Pedroso de Barros.\nInês Pedroso de Barros.\nLuzia Leme de Barros.\nThe bastard children:\n\nSebastiana, daughter of little Maria.\nPaulo, son of little Mary.\nPascoal, son of the Indian woman Vitorina.\nVentura, son of the Indian woman Iria.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPaulistana Genealogy - Silva Leme - book III, page. 444, chapter II and page. 445",

        "content": "Pires against Camargo or Guerra dos Pires against the Camargo was a rivalry that took place in the town of São Paulo, between the 1640s and 1660s, in which the two families came into conflict for different reasons. Leading to assassinations between both sides. The Pires and Camargo had political and military leaders, owners of huge wheat farms in Serra da Cantareira, therefore they competed for supremacy in São Paulo. The rivalry in the dispute for command of the Chamber was the main reason for the conflict.The dispute began around 1640, when Alberto Pires murdered Leonor de Camargo Cabral, his wife, and also Antônio Pedroso de Barros, his brother-in-law. It is not certain whether Alberto wanted the murder or whether he had hit his wife by chance, and, without knowing how to justify his death, he also killed his brother-in-law and accused the dead of adultery.\n\n\n== The beginning of the rivalry ==\nThe historian Afonso E. de Taunay says about this war in Ensaios Paulistas, 1958:\n\nThese are the facts included in what is called the conflict between the Pires and the Camargos, named after the two great families whose irreconcilability resulted in a true civil war, similar to the devastating municipal struggles in medieval Italian cities and of which the best known is that of the Capuletto and Montechio families, from Verona, immortalized by Shekespeare.!\nThe truncation and lack of documentation does not allow the narrative to be written, as the facts are obscure, but it should not be linked to the acclaim of Amador Bueno or the expulsion of the Jesuits. Says Taunay: «Such a prolonged struggle, in fact intermittent, was born from mere rivalry between clan leaders, for no reason other than personalism, family spirit and the gregarious tendency so vehement in small agglomerations. According to the genealogist Pedro Taques, the conflict began in 1640 in a true battle causing many deaths and injuries that took place in the streets of São Paulo, between the two factions whose leaders they were João Pires and Pedro Taques on one side and on the other Fernão de Camargo, nicknamed the Tiger. They had engaged in a singular duel, helped by their followers. The following year, Taques was murdered in false faith by the contender\", it is said that behind his back and in a churchyard.\nMany Taques supporters left, settling mainly in Parnaíba. Debalde Salvador Correia de Sá e Benevides came to try to calm the situation, asking for peace from those living in São Paulo and for them to go into the backlands in search of mines. The situation worsened with the arrival on the scene of the town's bellicose new vicar, Domingos Gomes de Albernaz. He feuded with his parishioners and the Chamber and was visibly the agent in São Paulo of Salvador Correia de Sá e Benevides and the Rio de Janeiro authorities committed to restitution to the Jesuits to his college. He would end up expelled from the village in 1646 and in May of that year he solemnly excommunicated his parishioners and the Chamber reacted in a daring letter in which he accused him of being a slave of the Jesuits.\n\n\n== The Murder of Leonor de Camargo Cabral ==\nThere were very turbulent years, says Afonso E. de Taunay, “the warring factions did not lay down their weapons. And as a consequence, the pace of Bandeirantism decreased noticeably, as was to be expected. Alberto Pires' crime unexpectedly occurred on Leonor de Camargo Cabral, his wife and, as was said at the time, on Antônio Pedroso de Barros, a great bandeirante who Alberto also killed in an ambush. Now, it was later proven that Antônio perished at the hands of his rebellious Indians. Alberto Pires was murdered by the Camargos, in reprisal.\nThe Pires, led by Fernão Dias, then opposed Fernão de Camargo's brother, José Ortiz de Camargo, taking office in the São Paulo ombudsman's office. There was later an agreement negotiated by the Pires, on 12 May 1653, by which the Jesuits returned to their college with a formal promise not to shelter runaway Indians nor to publish the papal brief of Urbano VIII about the freedom of the Gentile. The two factions continued their fight until the agreement\nof February 9 of 1654, by which Ortiz took over the Ombudsman's Office, but did not fulfill what he promised, and also lost the support of the General Government with the departure of the Count of Castelo Melhor , replaced by a magistrate closely linked to Pires. The fight was reignited, but there are only details and details, largely obscure. An ecclesiastical intervention promoted yet another attempt at pacification, which resulted in representatives from both parties going to Bahia to come to an understanding with the new governor-general, Jerónimo de Ataíde, Count of Atouguia. From the mission came an ordinance on November 24, 1655 granting general amnesty.\nAtouguia was succeeded in the government by Francisco Barreto de Menezes who requested an expedition designed to “suppress the rushes of the gentiles through the Bahian backlands”. It was organized under the command of Fernando de Camargo and Domingos Barbosa Calheiros, both leaders of the Camargos faction. They arrived in Salvador in October 1658 but the expedition had an unsuccessful outcome.\nThe riots in São Paulo were renewed in 1659, with Fernão Dias Pais facing off against José Ortiz de Camargo. Francisco Barreto even talked about personally going to accommodate the situation, he ended up dispatching the ombudsman and he was successful: with the parties exhausted, the two opposing leaders signed the agreement of January 1, 1660 and returned to the activity of the sertanista companies. Other sources point to January 25, 1660, as the date of signing of the peace agreement.\n\n\n== Marriage and posterity ==\nSilva Leme studies his descendants in Volume I of his «Genealogia Paulistana».\nThe genealogist says:\n«Captain Fernão de Camargo, nicknamed the Tiger, held the position of ordinary judge in S. Paulo (we find him in that position in 1653) and was already married in 1630, when his mother died, with Mariana do Prado, daughter of the Spaniard João de Santa Maria, born in Castile (who came to Brazil as secretary of D. Francisco de Sousa) and Filipa do Prado (Tit. Lemes Cap. 1 § 9.º). With his brother José Ortiz de Camargo captain Fernão de Camargo was the head of the Camargos party, which rose up against the Pires party, led by João Pires and his son-in-law Francisco Nunes de Siqueira (the Redeemer of the Fatherland (Tit. Pires Cap. 10th). The author of Nobiliarquia Paulistana Pedro Taques de Almeida accuses Fernão de Camargo as the murderer (the false faith) of Pedro Taques in Largo da Sé (then the main church of S. Paulo) in 1641. See what we wrote about this crime in Tit Taques. 1st. , this is partly attenuated because it was the result of a conspiracy. We did not discover the date of death, nor the inventory of Captain Fernão de Camargo, however, we discovered the following 14 children;\n\nCaptain Fernando Ortiz de Camargo o Moço who was captain under the orders of the captain-general Domingos Barbosa Calheiros «in the expedition against the gentile barbarians of the backlands of Bahia in 1658 . He married Joana Lopes, daughter of Gonçalo Lopes, born in the parish of Santa Marinha, Portugal, and Catarina da Silva, born in São Paulo, paternal granddaughter of Pedro Lopes and Ana da Costa, maternal granddaughter of Cosme da Silva and Isabel Gonçalves ». He died in 1690 leaving 13 children. Reminded by the governor-general to fight the Anaiós Indians in the backlands of the São Francisco River, in 1677, he did not follow, due to agitated political issues.\nCaptain Francisco de Camargo Santa Maria; he was an ordinary judge by ordination in 1696 in S. Paulo, and was married to Maria de Siqueira e Albuquerque, daughter of Captain Duarte Pacheco de Albuquerque, from Portugal, and Simona de Siqueira, by this granddaughter of Aleixo Jorge and by Maria Nunes de Siqueira (Tit.

        "content": "The Oxford Forest Conservation Area is a protected forest area of 11,350 ha (28,000 acres) located in foothills near the township of Oxford in North Canterbury, New Zealand. The area is also an accredited International Dark Sky Park.\nThe forest is a remnant of extensive beech and podocarp forests that previously covered inland parts of North Canterbury. Species present in the forest include mountain beech and examples of the podocarps rimu, mataī, kahikatea, and tōtara. The forest is mainly black beech (Nothofagus solandri) at lower altitudes, with mountain beech (Nothofagus cliffortioides) above 600 m (2,000 ft). From around 1851 to 1909, logging took place in the Oxford Forest and the nearby Woodside Forest property. Several fires in the late 19th century destroyed much of the forest, and logging ceased in 1915. Some areas of beech forest regenerated following a major fire in 1898. Sheep were grazed in some places from 1914, but grazing reduced after the 1930s, allowing more land to revert to beech. By 1973, the area was being managed as a forest park, with increasing areas of regenerating beech and plantations of exotic species.The Oxford Forest Conservation Area is classified as stewardship land, under section 25 of the Conservation Act 1987. It includes walking and mountain biking tracks and is a recreational hunting area. The conservation area includes Mount Oxford, with a height of 1,364 m (4,475 ft).\n\n\n== International Dark Sky Park ==\nIn 2024, the conservation area was designated by DarkSky International as New Zealand's second International Dark Sky Park. Readings of night sky luminance in the park have a median value of 21.45 mag/arcsec2 (corresponding to Bortle scale 3), and in places are as dark as 21.76 and 21.80 mag/arcsec2 (Bortle scale 1). \nThe application for designation was prepared by the Oxford Dark Sky Group, with member organisations including the Department of Conservation, the Waimakariri District Council, local schools, the Oxford Promotions Action Committee, community groups and sports clubs. The accreditation of the Oxford Forest Conservation Area is an initial step towards a larger dark-sky preserve. There are plans to reduce light pollution from the township of Oxford and extend the area of the dark-sky preserve by ten times, with the conservation area as the central dark core.\n\n\n== References ==\n Media related to Oxford Forest Conservation Area at Wikimedia Commons Media related to Oxford Forest Dark Sky Park at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== External links ==\nMt Oxford Conservation Area Short Walks at Visit Waimakariri\nOxford Dark Sky Incorporated at NZBN",

        "content": "PoliticusUSA is an American left-wing website that publishes hyperpartisan clickbait. Its content has been described by academic studies and journalistic reports as \"unreliable,\" \"misleading,\" and \"fake\". It is among the most popular U.S. political websites. \nPoliticusUSA was established in 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nA digital native media outlet, according to PoliticusUSA it was established in 2009.\n\n\n== Content ==\nPoliticusUSA's editorial mission is to convey \"news, political commentary & analysis from a liberal point of view\" [sic].Various academic studies and journalistic reports have identified PoliticusUSA as a left-leaning publisher of hyperpartisan content; \"misleading,\" \"unreliable\" or \"fake\" news; and clickbait. Writing for Vice, Mike Pearl has described PoliticusUSA as \"so one-sided that it's hard to be fully informed if that's all you read\", while Slate's Ben Mathis-Lilley has characterized PoliticusUSA as a \"low-budget\" site \"loaded with browser-murdering junk ads\". Dante Ramos, a Boston Globe columnist, described a 2016 PoliticusUSA column titled \"“Obama Just Annihilated Donald Trump with the Whole World Watching\" as \"clickbait\" and noted it was among a type of story that \"never live up to their billing\".PoliticusUSA has published health and medical misinformation. For instance, a 2015 article on the site claimed that the National Institutes of Health discovered marijuana \"kills cancer\", an assertion rated as False by Snopes, while a 2020 article claimed that the entire population of Oklahoma who took a COVID-19 test, tested positive for the virus, which PolitiFact graded False.Other stories on PoliticusUSA have also been discredited by fact checkers and mainstream media. For example, in 2018, according to Bloomberg, the site \"misleadingly reported ... [Donald] Trump asked for the constitution to be changed so he can be president for 16 years\" The previous year, PoliticusUSA reported that \"Senior White House officials\" stated the 2017 Shayrat missile strike was \"intended to make Trump look strong\", a claim Snopes classified as False. Also in 2017, PoliticusUSA published a story that claimed \"the Russians\" had created a fake Bernie Sanders Facebook fan page, a story The Observer described as \"fake news\".In 2018, PoliticusUSA re-reported a story from The Guardian that alleged Paul Manafort met with Julian Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom, a meeting both Manafort and Assange denied taking place. The claims in the story were criticized by Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting for, according to researcher Benjamin Horne, \"relying on anonymous sources, not providing any verifiable details, and being, in general, unbelievable given the high level of surveillance in the area surrounding the embassy\". In a later investigation of the story, Slate described it as \"journalistic malpractice\" and riddled with \"serious problems\"; The Intercept concluded there was no reason to believe the story was true.\n\n\n== Influence and reach ==\nDuring the time period May 1, 2015 to November 7, 2016, posts on PoliticusUSA that were shared to Twitter and Facebook were among the most-accessed U.S. political content. A 2017 study by Harvard researchers found that PoliticusUSA articles received \"substantially more attention on social media than they receive inlinks from open web media\". In the summer of 2018, PoliticusUSA traffic coming through Facebook had fallen roughly 80 percent, year over year, after Facebook began demoting from newsfeeds sites \"repeatedly dinged by fact-checkers\".As part of a 2020 study, researchers from the Polytechnic University of Milan found that the virality on Twitter of posts by PoliticusUSA and Breitbart outweighed all other sources examined in their research for reach and impact.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGateway Pundit\nPalmer Report\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Young Chicago Authors is a non-profit organization that promotes young writers and performers in the greater Chicagoland area. YCA provides opportunities for young adults to engage in creative expression, lyrical education, and community building. They are known for their Rooted & Radical (R&R) youth poetry festival which was previously called Louder Than A Bomb (LTAB). Some famous names one may recognize that participated at YCA include poets like Chance the Rapper, Nate Marshall, Kevin Coval, Eve Ewing, and Jamila Woods.\n\n\n== History ==\nYoung Chicago Authors was founded in 1991 by Robert Boone, a former author and creative writing teacher from Winnetka, Illinois. YCA was established with the intent of inspiring the youth of Chicago to engage in creative writing to tell their stories. In 2009, Robert Boone was given an award at the Coming Up Tall Leadership Enhancement Conference in recognition of his work with YCA. This conference was hosted at the White House by former first lady, Michelle Obama, who has similar roots also a Chicago Native.\nIn 2013, sexual assault allegations were brought up against Kevin Coval, former artistic director. Kevin Coval was the founder of the Louder Than A Bomb poetry festival, now named Rooted & Radical, but was fired after YCA's executive board decided to have him removed due to the sexual assault allegations he faced. Rebecca Hunter, the executive director, consequently announced her resignation from YCA in response to how the allegations were handled. In an interview with the Sun-Times, Hunter mentions how she was first made aware of the allegations when a group of young poets formed a “safety council” with the intent of identifying sexual predators within their community. After reviewing the list of predators, Hunter came to find that one of the listed names was someone who had a contract with YCA at the time and therefore suspended the alleged abuser, Kevin Coval, and YCA went forward with investigations of the claims.\nActing on the previous executive director's sexual abuse allegations, Young Chicago Authors has a new executive director, Demetrius Amparan, as of March 2021. He is passionate about the success of young people and putting them first and center to watch them flourish and grow. One of his goals is to be a good person for the children to look up to and he wants to be a positive influence on them.\n\n\n== Internal programs ==\n\n\n=== Rooted & Radical (R&R) Youth Poetry Festival ===\nFormerly known as Louder Than A Bomb (LTAB), this festival brought YCA a lot of acknowledgment and recognition in Chicago's Poetry scene. This program is not possible without the Teaching Artist (TA) that aid in coaching and educating the youth about  poetry and how to hone in on the skill of creative expression through their workshops. Teaching Artists at YCA create personal curriculums based on their own strengths: visual language of poetry, expanded poetry, interpersonal dynamic and word choices.  These TA's also create their own legacy by either having participated in YCA's festivals before becoming a TA or creating their own name after being a TA, such as Matt Muse (rapper former TA of YCA) and Dominique James (former champion LTAB and former TA of YCA).\n\n\n=== Wordplay ===\nWordplay holds a significant value to the organization. This event is a weekly event that is a safe space for young and prospective poets to express themselves through creativity. Both Wordplay and YCA as an entity allow for the children to grow, learn, and prosper. They also both create a sense of community to bring people together.\n\n\n== External programs ==\nFollowing the Kevin Coval and others sexual assault allegation scandal, YCA hosted a community event to re-establish connections with in the community. While do so, they wanted to acknowledge the sexual assault allegation and take accountability. While doing so, YCA shared their plans to move forward with the program while taking extreme messures in order to assure the community that these misconducts will never  be accepted in their space.To do so, they had to reschedule their Louder than Bomb event and postponed to 2021. Instead, they created workshops and town hall meetings. Since at this time, Chicago Public School did pull from endorsement YCA had to think of various ways to restore and regain trust. In doing so, YCA did take full responsibility for their leadership member and took the precious sought necessary in order to show the community their dedication to development.\nTo take part in the Black Lives Matter Movement, Young Chicago Authors partnered and did a collaboration with Koio. Through the partnership, an agreement to create a sneaker with the poem name “Untitled 2018” written by Taisaun Levin felt the most appropriate between the two brands. This shoe would create awareness to black struggles, black mental health, and black communities. Her poem was inspired by the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, etc. Since 100% of the proceeds made from the sneaker go to GoodKids MadCity, Black Lives Matter, and Young Chicago Authors, this promoted the partnership to response to the BLM social movement and promote racial justice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Dom Jerónimo de Ataíde (Lisbon, 1610–August 16, 1665) was the 6th Count of Atouguia and the 21st governor-general of Brazil (1654-1657).\nFirstborn of D. Filipa de Vilhena and D. Luís de Ataíde (3rd Count of Atouguia), he was one of the two brothers whom his famous mother armed with knights, sending them to fight to defend the independence of the country, becoming one of the brave noble restorers who carried out the coup d'état on December 1, 1640, and it is even said that he was one of those who entered the Paço da Ribeira, who went to the room of the traitor Miguel de Vasconcelos to kill him.\nHe was commander of Adaúfe and Vila Velha de Ródão, in the Order of Christ.\n\n\n== Positions held ==\nHe was the nobleman of the Royal House; he would be governor of Peniche in 1640, governor of arms of the provinces of Trás-os-Montes in 1649 and 1652, governor and captain-general of the State of Brazil (appointed by charter of February 21, 1653, took office on 14 December 1654), governor of the Arms of Alentejo in 1659, captain general of the Royal Armada on 25 June of 1662, president of the Board of Commerce in 1664, war advisor in 1661, and of the council of state in 1662; gentleman from the Chamber of King D. Afonso VI of Portugal.\nWhile serving as Arms governor of the province of Trás-os-Montes, he repelled a Spanish invasion across the border of Chaves.\n\n\n== Governor-general of Brazil ==\nIn the general government of Brazil, he received the embassy of the São Paulo people who tried to put an end to the war between Pires and Camargos that was disturbing the captaincy of the south, writing the famous ordinance of November 24 of 1655 in which he granted general amnesty. It was determined that the votes in the portfolios for the election of aediles were organized by three Pires supporters, as many opponents, and one neutral. These organizers of the tickets would not be “the leaders of the gang, but men among the most zealous and timid.\" The constitution of the municipal chambers would be such that there would always be a judge and a councilor from each of the fighting parties, a neutral councilor, and the council's attorney. His provision was received with expressions of joy in São Paulo, and the king greatly appreciated his delegate's decision.It was up to him to celebrate the final victory of arms against the Dutch. He repressed acts of rebellion by the Indians («Nobreza de Portugal», volume II, page 335) and exercised a model administration full of honesty and balance, unfortunately almost limited to the captaincy of Bahia, because, from the death of Mem de Sá, the governors of the other captaincies were arrogating successive prerogatives, only theoretically recognizing the hegemony of the Governor-General. The difficulty of communications and the size of Brazil also contributed to these facts».\nHe was succeeded in the government of Brazil by Francisco Barreto de Menezes.\n\n\n== Marriages and descendants ==\nHe married twice.\nHis first marriage was in 1658, to his cousin D. Maria de Castro (d. 1661), daughter of Francisco de Sá e Menezes, 2nd count of Penaguião, and Countess D. Joana de Castro. She gave birth to D. Manuel Luís de Ataíde, 7th count of Atouguia.\nHis second marriage was to  D. Leonor de Meneses, widow of the 1st Count of Serém, daughter and heiress of D. Fernando de Meneses, commander of Castelo Branco, and D. Jerónima de Toledo (this daughter of D. Manuel da Câmara, 2nd Count of Vila Franca. D. Leonor de Meneses was heiress, among other ties, of the former morgado of Carvalho, which would thus pass to the house of Atouguia, remaining there until the execution of the 11th count in 1759, in the so-called Távoras process. Inventories of the House of Tavora, Atoguia, and Aveiro. After that, Carvalho's estate would pass into the possession of the family of the 1st Marquês de Pombal. The couple had numerous children, including D. Luís Peregrino de Ataíde, who would become the 8th count of Atouguia, as his brother, the 7th count, died without issue. Leonor published, under the pseudonym Laura Múrcia, the work El Desdichado mas firma (Lisbon, 1655).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPassionate about genealogy, he wrote «Nobiliario das Familias d'este Reyno», four volumes, a manuscript that was preserved in the bookstore of the convent of Graça, in Lisbon.\nHe is buried in the main chapel of the convent of Santa Maria de Xabregas, patronage of his house.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAtouguia (D.

During 1757–1762, he studied Civil and Canon law at the University of Pisa. He then moved to Florence to work under the jurist Pompeo Neri. He obtained a salaried position in the State department of the Grand Duchy, and in 1768 was appointed professor of Moral Philosopy at the University of Florence. In 1769, Riguccio, along with Carlo Bonsi and Ferdinando Fossi, was appointed by Grand-Duke Leopold with the gargantuan task of reorganizing the archives of the Secretary of State of Tuscany. He continued into the 1790s with various government posts. He wrote a history of the House of Medici up to and including the last of grand-duke of the family, Gian Gastone. The work was commissioned by Grand-Duke Leopold.However, during the occupation of Tuscany by the French Revolutionary armies, in 1798 he also joined the French-backed puppet government. He was subsequently forced to flee to Paris, only to return to Florence in 1801.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGori Pasta, Orsola (1998). \"GALLUZZI, Jacopo Riguccio\".

        "content": "The Suguokamoto Site (須玖岡本遺跡)  is a Yayoi period cemetery and associated village, located in the Okamoto neighborhood of the city of Kasuga,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1951 as the \"Okamoto Site\", with the area under protection expanded in 2000 and the name changed to its present designation.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the northern part of Kasuga Hills, which stretches to the west of Kasuga City, are a large number of ruins dating back to the Yayoi period. Based on the quality and quantity of ruins and artifacts in this area, it is assumed that this area is the center of the kingdom of Nakoku (奴国, Nakoku, Na-no-Kuni) , which appears in the Book of the Later Han and the Gishi Wajinden (魏志倭人伝, Records of Wei: An Account of the Wa).  In 57 CE, Emperor Guangwu of Han granted Nakoku an imperial seal engraved with the Chinese characters 漢委奴國王 (Kan no Wa no Na-no-Koku-ō, \"King of the Na state of the Wa (vassal) of Han\" which was discovered over 1500 years later, by an Edo period farmer on Shikanoshima Island,\nThe site has been known since at least the Meiji period. In 1899 a local landowner built a house next to a megalith measuring 3.6 by 2.0 meters, and recorded having to relocate other megaliths during construction, at which time he found a grave and various artifacts, including shards of bronze mirrors.\nArchaeological excavations conducted in 1979-80 uncovered 116 pot tombs, nine earthen pit tombs and wooden coffin tombs, and associated ritual remains from the mid-Yayoi period within a radius of 2 kilometers north-to-south and one kilometer east-to-west, centered on the highest point of the site, 36.3 meters above sea level. It is estimated that there are more than 300 graves, including those that were partially destroyed, and the remains of nine pit dwellings were discovered on a slightly lower flat land on the west side, and a mold for a small bronze bell made of gneiss was also unearthed. Some of the jar coffins are accompanied by grave goods such as about 30 bronze mirrors made during China's Western Han Dynasty, glass or jade beads, and magatama, as well as many Yayoi pottery earthenware items. Bronze swords have also been recovered from the wooden coffin tombs and bronze swords and spears from the site of the megalithic grave, is speculated to have originally been a large burial mound similar to that found at the Mikumo-Iwara Site in neighboring Itoshima, Fukuoka, which also had many bronze foundries.\nThe site has been developed into the Nakuni-no-oka Historical Park, and in the two dome-shaped exhibition halls, where parts of the coffin tombs and ritual remains in their original condition at the time of excavation can be viewed. It is approximately a 20-minute walk from Minami-Fukuoka Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nKasuga city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Rox De Luca (born 1963) is an Australian visual artist who makes sculptural objects and installations predominantly from found plastics. She lives on Gadigal Land, in Bondi NSW. Since the mid-1980s De Luca has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions, nationally and internationally.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDe Luca's parents came to Australia from Italy. She has three sisters. Her mother, Anna De Luca was an artist and has work in the National Gallery of Australia collection.\nDe Luca has a Bachelor of Arts (Visual) from Canberra School of Art/ANU (1985) and a Graduate Diploma in Arts Administration, University of NSW (1988). At the Canberra School of Art De Luca's peers included Stephanie Radok, Tony Ayres, Jennifer Higgie and EX de Medici.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nSince the early 2010s De Luca's practice has focused on the concepts of abundance, excess and waste, and involves collecting kilos of plastic waste debris from the shores of local beaches such as Bondi Beach or Rose Bay in Sydney. Her practice is guided primarily by colour. At her studio the plastics are sorted and threaded using strings of wire into sculpture works that speaks to consumption, abundance, plastic pollution and waste. She was inspired by a talk given by Dr Jennifer Lavers of Adrift Lab about the effect of plastic in the oceans on marine life.\n\nIn their 2022 book Contemporary Art and Feminism, Jacqueline Millner and Catriona Moore say of De Luca's practice:Recyling as play-power, problem-identification, creative method and readymade material also drives Sydney-based artist Rox de Luca to string subtle, colourcoded plastic waste which she collects on her daily beach walks into beautiful sculptural forms that spill and loop across gallery walls and floors. Whether worn, draped, suspended or inhabited, they reprise the cheap, industrial materials proclaimed by Soviet Constructivist corner-reliefs during a more utopian period of design history. This haptic return of the repressed within the heterotopic space of the gallery extends righteous anger about our throwaway culture and our concern with the ethics of living sustainably.De Luca's earlier practice was influenced by her migrant background. She investigated histories of migration and the cross-cultural impact of everyday objects like kitchen implements and personal items such as a collection of Italian needlework patterns her mother gave to her. In August 2001 De Luca's work was part of a group exhibition of textile artworks by female Italian migrants to Australia, held at the Australian Maritime Museum.\nPrior to working with plastic waste, De Luca painted portraits.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 2024 De Luca was the inaugural artist in residence at Orlebar Brown.\nIn 2022 De Luca contributed work to the artist's collective Project Vortex - Intercepting the Plastic Waste Stream.\nDe Luca has been a finalist in a number of art prizes including the Deakin University Contemporary Small Sculpture Award in 2018, and the Ravenswood Australian Women’s Art Prize in 2017. She was on the judging panel of the City of Ryde Sustainable Waste to Art Prize in 2020.\n\n\n== Residencies ==\nDe Luca has received multiple artist-in-residence opportunities including in 2022 at the Gunyah Residency Program, NSW, and at the Woollahra Gallery at Redleaf, NSW. In 2019 De Luca was artist-in-residence at the Fremantle Arts Centre.\n\n\n== Selected Solo exhibitions ==\n2021 - Chutespace, Canberra\n2019 - Gleaning for plastic, on the beach, Art+Climate= Change, Loop, Melbourne\n2013 - Sculpture by the sea, Sydney\n2012 - Saved, James Dorahy Project Space, Sydney\n\n\n== Selected group exhibitions ==\n2024 - Colour is enough, Arts Project Australia, Melbourne, forthcoming Beauty Runs the Gauntlet, Bondi Pavilion Gallery\n2023 - Plastic: Unwrapping the World, Wagga Wagga Art Gallery\n2022 - Plastic-free Biennale Kandos, collaboration with Plastic Free Biennale, (Lucas Ihlein, Kim Williams, First Nations Sister GlitterNullius), Wayout, Kandos, NSW\n2022 - Material Girl, China Cultural Centre, Sydney, Curated by Nicholas Tsoutsas Omnivores, Duckrabbit, Redfern\n2021 - Hundreds and Thousands, Fremantle Arts Centre, Western Australia\n2021 - On REvolution, Gallery Central, North Metro TAFE, Perth\n2020 - Contour 556, Curated by Neil Hobbs, Canberra\n2019 - The Art for the Wilderness, Queen Street Galleries, Woollahra, Sydney\n2018 - Sentient Visibility, Grace Cossington Smith Gallery, Sydney\n2010 - Más Razones, with Jo Darbyshire, Espacio Menosuno, Madrid\n2001 - Stitches - Fare Il Punto, Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney\n1999 - Family Ties, 24HR Art, Darwin\n\n\n== Collections ==\nArtbank, Australia\nDeakin University Art Gallery Collection, Victoria\nEdith Cowan University, Western Australia\nNew England Regional Art Museum, NSW\nRoyal Perth Hospital, Western Australia\nUniversity of Sydney Union, NSW\nPrivate collections Australia, Europe and USA.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Neal Protocol is a shotgun load that was used for ambushes during the Vietnam War. When implementing the \"Neal Protocol,\" the magazine tube is loaded with buckshot, and the chamber is loaded with one slug. This means that the first shot fired will always be a slug, and the followup rounds will all be buckshot.\nThe slug is chambered first because during an ambush, the shooter who initiates the ambush will have time to aim more carefully and direct a well placed shot at the leader of the enemy squad. Once there is a panic among members of the enemy squad and they start to flee, the remaining shells can be fired with less precision and haste due to the spread of the buckshot.\nAccording to unconfirmed Youtube comments, this protocol was developed by William Neal, who taught the protocol for nearly 50 years after it was developed during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cherry blossoms play an important role in the city of Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. Seattle has more than 1,000 cherry trees donated by Japan as a symbol of friendship. Christine Clarridge of Axios Seattle wrote, \"The annual bloom of cherry trees across Seattle symbolizes the end of the dark months and the beginning of spring, drawing residents and swarms of tourists to the city's most popular viewing places.\" The season's peak varies depending on weather conditions, but generally lasts from January to March.Cherry blossoms are used for beautification purposes and have been as a symbolic gesture of friendship between Japan and the U.S. for more than a century. In 2024, Time Out included Seattle in a list of the thirteen best places for cherry blossom viewing in the United States.\n\n\n== Viewing sites and associated events ==\nPopular sites for cherry blossom viewing can be found in the University District, at Seattle Center, at Seward Park, as well as a stretch of Lake Washington Boulevard north of the park. The annual Cherry Blossom and Japanese Cultural Festival, established in 1976, was originally held at the park before moving to Seattle Center. Eleven new cherry trees were planted at Seattle Center in February 2024. Other parks with cherry trees include Green Lake Park, Jefferson Park, and Washington Park Arboretum.The Seattle Japanese Garden has cherry trees. Pike Place Market in downtown Seattle also has cherry trees; eight trees were planted along Pike Street in December 2023. A stretch along 22nd Avenue, between East John Street and East Republican Street, has Chinese double cherry, Kwanzan flowering cherry (Prunus 'Kanzan'), and Yoshino cherry blossoms. Part of Condon Way West, has Kwanzan trees. An area near NE 55th Street and 12th Avenue NE is also known for blossoms.Outside Seattle, cherry trees can be found throughout the region, including Downtown Bellevue Park, the Washington State Capitol campus in Olympia, and Tacoma's Point Defiance Park.\n\n\n=== University District ===\nThe Quad, on the campus of the University of Washington, has 29 Yoshino cherry trees. According to an arborist with the university, \"Historically, peak bloom in the Quad typically begins during the third full week of March and goes into the fourth week of March.\"Peak viewing season at the Quad can result in increased traffic and limited parking. In 2024, approximately 80 businesses participated in the U District Cherry Blossom Festival, which features \"blossom-themed\" activities and food options. The Seattle Cherry Blossom Run goes through the campus and Burke-Gilman Trail.\n\n\n=== Chinatown–International District ===\nIn the Chinatown–International District, Little Saigon has cherry trees, and Mt. Fuji cherry trees can be found along the northeast edge of Kobe Terrace. In 2024, the Seattle Department of Transportation planted eleven new cherry trees outside the Japanese Cultural and Community Center.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHanami\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cherry blossoms in Seattle at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Vega Refinery is a Romanian oil refinery owned by Rompetrol and located in Ploiești, Prahova County. The refinery has a processing capacity of over 350,000 tons of feedstock/year. It is also the sole producer of hexane and bitumen in Romania with a production capacity of 66,000 tons of bitumen per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nOn 5 January 1905, the Vega Society was established by the German bank Disconto-Gesellschaft together with French investors. The bank had been interested in the Romanian oil industry since 1899, when it founded the Internaționala Română society in the Netherlands. In 1904, the same bank formed the oil transport society Creditul Petrolifer which built an extensive oil pipeline network in the Telega region.\nThe construction of the refinery began in May 1905, under the leadership of the administration council presided over by Titu Maiorescu. The refinery, located near the Ploiești–Vălenii de Munte rail line, was finished on 1 December 1905 and began production on 26 February 1906. It had an area of around 50 hectares (120 acres) and a processing capacity of 200,000 tons of crude oil per year. The transport of crude oil was initially done by carts and 300 tank wagons of which 246 were owned by Creditul Petrolifer. By 1935, the society operated some 1,200 tank wagons, as well as four locomotives, and 421 railway lines.\nThe refinery, with its automatic installations and electric pumps, could process 120 crude oil wagons per day and produce a variety of oil products, such as lubricating oils and asphalt. From 1908, while Lazăr Edeleanu was the director of the refinery, he developed a new method of oil refining, called the Edeleanu process.\n\n\n=== First World War and interwar period ===\nDuring World War I, with the advance of the Central Powers armies into Romania in November 1916, the majority of oil wells in Romania were destroyed as a precautionary measure as to not fall into enemy hands. A commission formed by several British officers and led by British Lieutenant-Colonel John Norton-Griffiths, together with Prince George Valentin Bibescu and several Romanian engineers conducted the plan on 5 December. While the damage sustained by Vega was significant, the refinery was not fully destroyed, which prompted the Germans to restart production in March 1917.\nAfter the war, the German-owned companies were taken by the Romanian state. At the insistence of other international companies, Vega and Creditul Petrolifer were taken over by the Belgian Petrofina company, while Concordia (another company previously owned by Disconto-Gesellschaft) was taken by the French Compagnie Française des Pétroles. In 1922, the Vega refinery came into the possession of Concordia after the company was merged with the Vega and Creditul Petrolifer under the Franco-Belgian Petrofina trust led by Léon Wenger. During the interwar period, Vega was ranked second among the Romanian refineries, after Astra Română.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nAfter the start of World War II, Concordia was placed under military jurisdiction on 11 December 1940, and until 1945 it was controlled by the General Staff and the Ministry of Endowment of the Army and War Production. Also in 1940, a Mobilization and Passive Defense Service was established with the role of camouflaging the refinery and constructing bomb shelters for the workers. Brick walls were also erected around tanks, and walls up to 10 m high were built for protection. With Romania's entry into the war, the Vega refinery was first bombed on 18 July 1941 by Soviet bombers. Only one oil tank was set on fire, while the anti-aircraft artillery shot down one bomber.\nWith America's declaration of war on Romania in 1942, and with the arrival of the Halverson Detachment equipped with B-24 bombers in Egypt, the refineries from Ploiești were targeted once again. Vega did not sustain any damage on the 12 June 1942 raid. Designated as target White 2 for the low-level raid code-named Operation Tidal Wave, the refinery was attacked on 1 August 1943 by the 376th and 93d Bomb Groups. In the aftermath of the raid, damage sustained by Vega amounted to just 15%, which was quickly repaired and the refinery increased its production by September.\nBetween April and August 1944, the Vega refinery was attacked several times. It suffered heavy damage in the 31 May raid, and by the end of the war damage caused to the refinery amounted to about 442 million lei with almost 90% of the refinery being affected. The four main oil processing installations did not suffer significant damage however.\n\n\n=== Post-war to modern day ===\nThe damages suffered during the war were fully repaired by 1948. In the same year, the Concordia society was nationalized and the refinery was transferred to the state, being renamed Refinery No. 2. Between 1949 and 1955, the refinery was under the control of the Sovrompetrol. Once it was transferred back to the state, the refinery was modernized and by 1981 it could be manufacture petroleum solvents for the chemical and petrochemical industry, as well as detergents, petroleum jelly, and special bitumens.\nIn 1990, after the revolution, the Vega Refinery became a joint-stock company. The company was privatized in 1998, and the majority stake was purchased by Rompetrol in 1999. Following a $7 million investment, a processing unit of polymer-modified road bitumen was finished in 2007. In 2014, a record 61.400 tons of bitumen and 64.000 tons of n-hexane were produced.\nCurrently, the Vega refinery is the only producer of bitumen in Romania, and the only producer of n-hexane in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPetrotel Lukoil Refinery\nPetrobrazi Refinery\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion is a 2024 documentary film directed by Eva Orner, focused on the business practices of clothing brand Brandy Melville. The film is based on Kate Taylor's reporting for Insider.\n\n\n== Background ==\nItalian clothing brand Brandy Melville was founded in the 1980s, and maintains 95 retail locations in more than 15 countries. It opened its first store in the United States in 2009, targeting Westwood, Los Angeles, near the campus of UCLA. In the 2010s, the brand became extremely popular among girls and young women in the United States, where it now has 36 stores.\nThe brand is associated with a beachy, Americana style of marketing and decoration, and with thin, blond models and staff. Employees are generally girls about 16 years old. Brandy Melville generally manufactures clothing marketed as one-size-fits-all, and has been criticized as exclusive of many body shapes; the branding was changed to \"one size fits most\" in response to public backlash. This one size roughly corresponds to a typical XS or S in the United States. The brand has also been accused of copying the work of independent clothing designers, and Forever 21 sued them for copyright infringement in 2016.\n\nAfter Kate Taylor published an article for Insider about Brandy Melville's alleged malpractice in 2021, the brand issued no apology and faced no financial repercussions. Its market has continued to expand, particularly in China, where its sizing is even smaller. A viral \"BM challenge\" in China encourages girls to lose enough weight to fit into a Brandy Melville skirt.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nBrandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion focuses on the business practices of Brandy Melville, detailing allegations of antisemitism, discrimination based on weight, inappropriate interactions with minors, racism, and sexual assault. Many of these accusations center on Brandy Melville's founder and chief executive officer, Stephan Marsan. The documentary includes interviews with various people affiliated with the company, including former employees. The allegations of bigotry are interspersed with discussion of the brand's fast fashion status.\nBrandy Hellville ends with a request for people to boycott Brandy Melville.\n\n\n=== Allegations of bigotry ===\nThe film describes allegations by journalist Kate Taylor and former employees that Marsan consistently acted in a racist and body-shaming manner toward employees. These include claims that white employees were commonly given public-facing roles in stores while people of color were assigned to tasks in the back, and Asian people were specifically assigned to work the register; Taylor states that two racism-related lawsuits have been filed against Brandy Melville.\nFormer employees also allege that they were made to feel bad about their bodies, that some employees were explicitly offered jobs or fired because of their body shape, and that employees were required to take full-body photos of themselves at the start of each shift and send them to Marsan and an assistant who ran the brand's Instagram page. One employee states that Marsan saved some of these photos in a file, and another reported having received requests for employees' \"chest and feet\" to be included in the full-body photos. A former vice president says in an interview that Marsan fired employees whose photos he didn't like. Multiple employees say that they had eating disorders while working for Brandy Melville. Multiple executives allege that Marsan viewed the brand's \"one size fits most\" policy as a way to maintain its exclusivity, and that he was happy that it was being criticized.\n\nTwo former associates of Brandy Melville state in interviews that antisemitic, misogynistic, and racist jokes were sent in a company-wide group chat called \"Brandy Melville Gags,\" including an image of Marsan dressed as Adolf Hitler and photos of him mocking Black people. A screenshot included in the documentary shows an emaciated woman wearing a sash with the words \"Miss Auschwitz, 1943.\" A former store owner states that store owners and members of the Italian manufacturing division were in the chat, as well as Marsan and his brother.\nIn the film, former employees also allege that Marsan, a self-described libertarian, discussed politics with his young female employees and routinely became upset when many of them supported Bernie Sanders. He also allegedly distributed copies of Atlas Shrugged, a novel by Ayn Rand that supports capitalism. A private label of Brandy Melville is named John Galt after a character in the book.\n\n\n=== Sexual assault allegations ===\nTaylor reports on an alleged sexual assault at the \"Brandy apartment\" in SoHo, Manhattan. Former Brandy Melville employees who stayed at the apartment state that men would unexpectedly enter and sometimes stay overnight. In a hospital report, a 21-year-old employee alleged that after being offered the apartment as a place to stay while in the United States on a visa, she went drinking with an older Italian man who was unexpectedly also staying in the apartment. After having two drinks, she reported that her memory lapsed and she woke up naked in the apartment. The hospital report stated that she had been \"raped by her boss and didn’t want to report it\" because she was afraid she would have to leave the United States if she lost her job.\n\n\n=== Fast fashion ===\n\nThe film additionally characterizes Brandy Melville as a fast fashion company. It alleges that while clothing \"Made in Italy\" is often considered luxurious in the United States, the brand's clothing is likely manufactured in fast fashion facilities in Prato. Matteo Biffoni, the mayor of Prato, says in an interview that there are several fast fashion factories in Prato, and that some use unethical labor practices. The documentary also states that the business model of Brandy Melville sometimes involves making near-exact copies of clothing purchased elsewhere by employees, and former employees allege that executives sometimes offered to purchase the clothes the employees were wearing so that the brand could copy and manufacture them. It also describes the way many items of fast fashion clothing end up in Accra where they are resold or dumped and end up in the ocean and on beaches.\nTaylor discusses the corporate structure of Brandy Melville, which Orner describes as unusually \"chaotic\". Taylor states that a different shell corporation owns each of the brand's stores, and the trademark is owned by a company in Switzerland, a structure Orner characterizes as \"not meant to be traceable\". Taylor also says that Marsan himself has virtually no presence on the Internet.\n\n\n== Production ==\nBrandy Hellville was directed by Eva Orner, based on reporting by Kate Taylor for Insider. Orner states that she had not heard of Brandy Melville until 2022, when producers suggested the brand as a topic for an investigatory documentary film.\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, Stephan Marsan declined to be interviewed for the documentary. Orner stated that it was difficult to find former employees to interview because many were afraid of potential repercussions, and because many employees worked for Brandy Melville when they were very young, meaning they are now \"young women embarking on careers or in their twenties\". Former employees are identified only by their first names.\nThe film premiered at South by Southwest and was released on HBO on April 9, 2024. It has a runtime of 91 minutes.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review in The New York Times noted that documentaries with similar topics have been made before, citing White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch as one example. However, the reviewer stated that the documentary was set apart by its engagement with the idea that Brandy Melville is in some ways cultlike, although they found that this was  \"underdeveloped\" over the course of the film.\nReviewing Brandy Hellville for NPR alongside two other \"eye-opening documentaries\", Linda Holmes summarized the narrative as \"the story of how social media helped make a juggernaut out of a whole lot of nondescript tiny shirts\". She expressed appreciation for the discussion of \"gross in-store culture\", also comparing the documentary to White Hot, but noted that she wished for more focus on the brand's involvement with fast fashion.\n\n\n== References ==",

His brother Giovanni (1779 – 1851) was a prominent astronomer and Catholic priest. His brother Marcello was a prominent alabaster sculptor. As a young man, Francesco fought in the Napoleonic wars in 1799. He then returned to Tuscany, where he began collecting mainly Etruscan antiquities. He founded a college at Fiesole. He published illustrations of some of his collections in his ten volume Monumenti etruschi (1820–1827), Galleria Omerica (also titled Raccolta di monumenti antichi esibita dal cav. Francesco Inghirami per servire allo studio dell'Illiade e dell'Odissea 3 volumes, 1829–1851), Pitture di vasi fittili (1831-1837), Museo etrusco chiusino (2 volumes, 1833), and the incomplete Storia della Toscana (1841-1845). He illustrated and engraved many if not most of the drawings for these texts.\n\n\n== Gallery of Illustrations ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The episode was hosted by Jimmy Savile, and featured a pre-recorded segment by Alan Freeman taped in London, that had him talking about next week's programme. The first solo artist and first act all together to appear on the show was Dusty Springfield, who sang \"I Only Want to Be with You\", and the first band to appear on the show was The Rolling Stones, who performed the song \"I Wanna Be Your Man\".\n\n\n== Featured artists ==\nThe songs featured on the episode were (in a partially correct order):\n\nDusty Springfield – \"I Only Want to Be with You\" (studio performance)\nThe Rolling Stones – \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (studio performance)\nThe Dave Clark Five – \"Glad All Over\" (studio performance)\nThe Hollies – \"Stay\" (studio performance)\nThe Swinging Blue Jeans – \"Hippy Hippy Shake\" (studio performance)\nGene Pitney – \"Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa\" (footage of audience dancing)\nCliff Richard and The Shadows – \"Wishing Well\" (promo)\nCliff Richard and The Shadows – \"Don't Talk to Him\"\nThe Beatles – \"She Loves You\" (played over chart rundown)\nFreddie and the Dreamers – \"You Were Made for Me\" (studio performance)\nThe Beatles – \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (promo)\n\n\n== Archive status ==\nThis edition of TOTP is no longer held in the BBC archives, as the footage was Wiped.

        "content": "The Watertown Daily Times is a daily newspaper publishing Monday through Friday in Watertown, Wisconsin. Along with the Daily Jefferson County Union, it is one of two major daily papers published in Jefferson County. The Watertown Daily Times also covers the southern portion of Dodge County, with the City of Watertown split between Dodge and Jefferson Counties.\nThe editorial operation of the Watertown Daily Times is located in downtown Watertown, though the paper's printing operations have been conducted at sister publication, The Gazette in Janesville since the paper's relocation in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Daily Times was founded November 23, 1895, when John W. Cruger and E. J. Schoolcraft formed a partnership to publish a daily newspaper in Watertown.

It was released on April 17, 2024, through EMI Records. Primarily a hip hop recording with gospel influences, \"Rise Together\" served as the image song for the Japanese release of the 2024 American monster film Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn April 10, 2024, Ai began to tease new music on her social media accounts. Singing a cappella, she shared a video online of her within a miniature constructed city. Two days later on April 12, Toho released a trailer for the Japanese dub version of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. On social media, Ai announced she recorded an image song for the film. Yaffle, who produced Ai's 2023 promotional single \"World Dance\", commented he \"called on Ai, who has a strong ability to grab listener's ears\". In regards to the lyrics and song title, Ai stated she was inspired by the film's original trailer, sublimating the trailer's catchphrase \"Rise together or fall alone\". Ai additionally stated her and Yaffle's musical styles \"matched really well\" in production of the song. Oricon reported \"Rise Together\" samples the musical theme of Akira Ifukube's \"Godzilla (Main Theme)\" alongside Ai's \"gospel-like roar\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nMusicians\n\nAi Carina Uemura – vocals, songwriter\nYaffle – production, songwriter\nOZworld – vocals, songwriter\nAkira Ifukube – songwriter\nTakezo Yamada – trumpet\nTechnical\n\nTsubasa Yamazaki – mastering\nMasahito Komori – mixing, immersive mixing\nAntoni \"Foux\" Kochanowski – vocal engineer\nTaisei Shiiba – assistant recording engineer\nYohei Kunii – vocal engineer\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The only placement they obtained was the top 10 finalists, won by Isabel Gigante in 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Vicente Gonzalez acquired the license for Miss Grand Spain in 2015, he began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name the provincial representatives to compete in the national pageant the following year. In the province of Ciudad Real, the competition license was granted to a local organizer, José Pineño, who then organized the first Miss Grand Ciudad Real competition at Sercotel Guadiana, Ciudad Real on April 23, 2016, with 21 contestants from different municipalities participating. Of whom, the representative of Villarrubia de los Ojos, Ana María Urda, was named the first Miss Grand Ciudad Real.\nSome municipalities, such as Valdepeñas and Villarrubia de los Ojos, also organized local preliminary pageants to select their representatives for Miss Grand Ciudad Real.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Ciudad Real's annual editions since 2016.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Ciudad Real representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Spain national pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Spain at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Spain official website",

        "content": "The Bruneian-Tundun War, also called the Bruneian Expedition to Luzon, was a military invasion and later occupation of Tondo in Luzon by the Bruneian Sultanate in the 15th century. The invasion resulted in the formation of the Kingdom of Selurong, the Brunei Sultanate chose to end the Dynasty of Tondo's monopoly in the China trade.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn c. 1500, prior to the Spanish reached in the Philippines, the Bruneian Empire, launched an attack on the Kingdom of Tondo, a significant trading city located on Luzon Island. Bolkiah, the fifth Sultan who controlled the Sultanate from 1485 to 1525, was in charge of the Bruneian Empire at the time of the assault. Given that Bolkiah supervised Brunei's rise to prominence as a powerhouse that swept over the Malay archipelago, his reign is perhaps best remembered as the empire's golden period. The first records of a Maynila and a Tondo date back to the Martín de Goiti voyage to Manila in 1570.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nSultan Bolkiah was renowned for frequently traveling overseas in an effort to get fresh perspectives and information that would aid in the development of his nation. But he really started to gather traction in 1500 when he made the decision to visit the Kingdom of Tondo in an effort to increase his power. Bolkiah founded the city of Selurong—later named Maynila, on the other side of the Pasig River shortly after taking over Tondo from its monarch, Lakan Gambang. \nFollowing the Sultan's victory in Tondo, the customary Rajahs, referred to as the Lakandula, kept their titles and possessions, but the House of Soliman, which housed the Manila Rajahs, gained control of them. Following this triumph, Brunei ruled over Borneo and the western Philippines for almost a millennium, until starting to decline in influence in the 18th century. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAs a result of this victory, Brunei had control over Borneo and the civilisations around the Manila Bay, it only truly begin to lose its holdings in the 1700s. Through Brunei, Tondo was connected to the international commercial network centered at Melaka. It wasn't until Bruneian traders moved in the Manila region at the beginning of the 16th century that Luzon started to become Islamic. Islam had spread as far north as Luzon by the time the Spanish came, and Rajah Sulaiman II governed Manila. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hihaizuka Kofun (日拝塚古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Shimohirasui Minami neighborhood of the city of  Kasuga,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1976.  \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Hihaizuka Kofun is located on a low terrace on the right bank of the Naka River in the Hakata Plain. This area was the center of the Yayoi period Kingdom of Na , which, according to the Book of the Later Han, was granted a gold imperial seal by Emperor Guangwu of Han in 57 CE  The kingdom is mentioned in vol. 30 of the Chinese Book of Wei from the Records of the Three Kingdoms,  titled \"The Account of the Easterners: A Note on the Wa\" (Chinese: 東夷傳‧倭人條), indicating that it continued to exist in the 3rd century.\nThe tumulus is a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above, and is orientated towards the west. It has  a total length of 41.2 meters, with a 22-meter diameter posterior circular portion with a height of 5.9 meters and a 34-meter wide anterior rectangular portion with a height of 5.4 meters. The tumulus was built in two stages, and no fukiishi or haniwa discovered.  Although it has disappeared now, there was once a moat surrounding it, and the total length including the moat was about 60 meters.  \nThe burial chamber is located in the center of the posterior portion and is a horizontal-entry stone chamber made of granite blocks that opens to the southwest. It is 3.6 by 2.6 meters, and four meters high with a 4.8 meter long passage that is only one meter wide by 1.5 meters high. When excavated in 1929 a large quantity of grave goods were discovered, including a bronze mirror,  earring with gold drape, four gold rings and other accessories, and one long iron sword with a ring pommel. Numerous pieces of horse fittings, including three sets of iron ring stirrups, and Sue ware pottery were also found. Based on the characteristics of the tumulus and excavated items, the tumulus was constructed in the 6th century. \nCurrently, the excavated items are stored at the Tokyo National Museum, and the Nakuni-no-Oka History Museum in Kasuga City preserves earrings with gold pendants. The tumulus is being maintained as a park. It is located approximately a 15-minute walk from Hakata-Minami Station on the JR Kyushu Hakata Minami Line.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nKasuga city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Jennifer DeSena (born March 12, 1969) is an American attorney and politician serving as the 38th Town Supervisor of North Hempstead, in Nassau County, New York, in the United States.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDeSena was born on March 12, 1969, in the New York City borough of the Bronx. She moved to Massapequa, New York when she was two, and was raised there for the rest of her childhood, eventually graduating from Massapequa High School. She attended Boston College, where she earned her bachelor's degree, majoring in economics and English. She then attended the St. John's University School of Law, where she earned her Juris Doctor degree. She then began practicing litigation law, before serving as a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney in Manhattan.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nDeSena began her political career in 2021, when she ran for Town Supervisor upon the retirement of then-incumbent Judi Bosworth (D–Great Neck). DeSena won the election over her opponent, then-Town Clerk Wayne H. Wink Jr. (D–Roslyn). DeSena, a registered Democrat, ran on the Republican and Conservative tickets, and her 2021 victory marked the first time in over three decades that a Republican-backed candidate won the position.DeSena was re-elected to a second term in November 2023, defeating her Democrat-backed opponent, former Town Supervisor Jon Kaiman, in a landslide victory.As Town Supervisor, DeSena has advocated for ending partisan politics in North Hempstead, reforming and improving the Town's building department, installing sanitary sewers along Plandome Road's business district in Manhasset, and improving services and maintaining the quality of life for residents. She has advocated against policies proposed by state lawmakers – including Governor Kathleen Hochul's attempts at overriding local control of zoning and cutting funds for schools, citing the unintended consequences from such policies, which would negatively impact the community and the environment.DeSena was also vocally against George Santos, following the news being made known of his scandals, and called for him to resign. Although she initially endorsed him for the election before his scandals were known, she became one of the first Republican politicians in the district to publicly denounce and condemn him after the allegations were confirmed; DeSena publicly rescinded her endorsement of him and expressed her anger, stating how she and many others were betrayed and deceived by Santos, and condemning him for his lies about being Jewish and exploiting the Holocaust. DeSena banned him from North Hempstead events and was one of several Republican leaders who were vocally against him serving in Congress.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDeSena resides in the Strathmore section of Manhasset, New York, having moved there with her husband, Ralph, in 2000; her husband is also an attorney. She and her husband have two children.Prior to being elected as Town Supervisor, DeSena had long been heavily involved in Manhasset's civic associations and with other local community organizations in the area. She also lead the Manhasset Coalition Against Substance Abuse and was the President of the Women's Club of Strathmore, Manhasset's North Strathmore Civic Association.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMay W. Newburger – A previous North Hempstead Town Supervisor.\nNorman Penny\nMichael J. Tully Jr.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSupervisor Jennifer S. DeSena – North Hempstead, New York",

        "content": "French Campaign, 1814 (French: Campagne de France, 1814, alternative title: 1814) is an oil on wood painting by French painter Ernest Meissonier, created between 1860 and 1864. It is part of his Napoleonic cycle of paintings, with 1807, Friedland and The Morning of Castiglione (unfinished). It represents Napoleon and his military staff during the French Campaign of 1814. It is widely considered Meissonnier's most famous work, and its sale in 1890 reached a record price for a painting by a contemporary artist. It is now held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNapoleon and his staff are depicted in the snowy and muddy Champagne countryside, after the defeat at the Battle of Laon, in 9–10 March 1814, to the Prussian army. Napoleon rides is white horse, with a resigned expression. Besides the Emperor, are shown Michel Ney, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Antoine Drouot, Charles de Flahaut and Gaspard Gourgaud. The painting atmosphere seems to predict Napoleon's upcoming defeat.\nThe painting is surprisingly small for a military subject. Charles Blanc wrote that Meissonier “paints greatly in small” scale. Indeed, the artist represents even smallest details such Napoleon's sprouting beard or the veins of the horses' legs.\nMeissonier approach to this and other historical paintings of this time was similar as possible to an historian. He consulted a vast documentation and talked with several eyewitnesses to achieve the most possible accurate depiction.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nExhibited at the Salon of 1864, the painting was purchased in 1866 by the banker Gustave Delahante for 85,000 francs. Sold by Delahante to an anonymous dealer in 1890 (known by his initials MB) for 500,000 francs, the dealer resold the painting to Alfred Chauchard for 850,000 francs, the highest price at the time for a painting by a living artist. Bequeathed by Chauchard to the Louvre, it entered its collections in 1909. In 1986, the work was assigned to the Musée d'Orsay, where its still held.\n\n\n== References ==",

He subsequently leaves Fraggle Rock and devotes his time to exploring Outer Space, sending back postcards to Gobo recounting his adventures. Matt is well-meaning but clumsy and completely oblivious to the world around him; his woefully incorrect perceptions of the human world provide much of the humor for his character.\n\n\n== Character biography and storylines ==\nAs a child, Matt was raised by his Uncle Gobo, who resembled an older version of himself. He dreamed of his following in his uncle's footsteps as an explorer, though Uncle Gobo did not approve of Matt's dreams. During a famine in Fraggle Rock, when the Fraggles run out of mushrooms, their primary food source, Matt inadvertently discovered radishes in the Gorgs' garden.By the start of the series, Matt is already a well-known and respected explorer in Fraggle Rock. The first episode begins with him exploring the last uncharted area in the Rock. Here, he discovers an entrance leading into the home of the human Doc. Matt, now choosing to go by the name \"Traveling Matt\", leaves Fraggle Rock, sending postcards back to Gobo in which he recounts his discoveries in Outer Space. Gobo must journey into Outer Space, and get past Doc's dog Sprocket, in order to retrieve these postcards.Matt remains in Outer Space for most of the series, only occasionally returning to Fraggle Rock. This changes in the episode \"Uncle Matt's Discovery\", when Matt discovers a cave he names the T. Matthew Fraggle Room, which contains a number of portals that lead to various locations in Outer Space. While he continues his explorations in Outer Space, Matt returns to Fraggle Rock more often from this point on, telling Gobo of his exploits in person instead of sending postcards.In a 2006 interview, Matt's performer Dave Goelz discussed the three character flaws that define Matt's personality: his misperception, his clumsiness (created by Goelz to make taping Matt's segments more interesting), and his denial of the first two flaws. As Goelz later said in a 2011 interview:\n“The original concept for him was that he went out and misinterpreted everything and then sent postcards back that we saw on video, where he described the outside world in a distorted way. I just didn't think it was very funny, so I started adding two other components. I started adding clumsiness so he was also physically an inept explorer. And then I added this emotional disconnect. So when he wrote back to his nephew, he would say, \"I decided to leave the shop.\" In actuality, you see him being drop-kicked out of the place and flying through the air and hitting a wall. That aesthetic started to become part of the material, and it was written in as we developed it.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nUncle Traveling Matt was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Tim Clarke. Dave Goelz, also the performer of Boober, was cast to play the character. Matt's name was derived from a traveling matte, a type of filmmaking technique.\n\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nUncle Traveling Matt has made several cameo appearances in Muppet productions, being the only Fraggle (although not the only Fraggle Rock character) to do so. He appeared as a guest at Kermit and Miss Piggy's wedding in The Muppets Take Manhattan, and also appeared in The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years. He also appeared, along with the other Fraggles, in the 1987 TV special A Muppet Family Christmas.\nDave Goelz vocally reprised his role as Matt for the 2020 short-form TV series Fraggle Rock: Rock On!, produced for Apple TV+, while John Tartaglia performed the puppetry. In Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, Goelz once again provided Matt's voice, with Frank Meschkuleit and Kevin Clash alternating the puppetry.\n\n\n== References ==",
