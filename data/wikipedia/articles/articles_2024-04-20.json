It has received new attention in the 2010s and early 2020s with the The 1619 Project.\nCommon points of contention include:\n\nThe extent in which American actions in the Cold War were justified.\nThis includes debates on whether McCarthyism was simply a matter of historical paranoia or justified, whether the nation's foreign policy was in contradiction to its stated principles, and how great a threat Marxist–Leninist states actually were.\nTopics surrounding race, gender, and sexuality, including the impact of slavery, historical persecution of Native Americans, and the Lavender Scare.\nWhether attempts to migrate past injustices, such as affirmative action, land acknowledgements, and the growing presence of \"DEI\" in many American institutions are counterproductive or beneficial.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian history wars\nCanadian history wars\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Elizabeth Hubbell Fisk (1859 – 1927) was a Vermont textile maker known for repopularizing a Colonial-era style of rug making and creating a cottage industry in northern Vermont. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFisk was born  second daughter of eleven children born to Margaret and John Hubbell of Chazy, New York.  In 1880, she married Nelson W. Fisk, the son of a quarry owner from Isle La Motte, Vermont. The couple spent winters in New York City where Fisk studied art and dye chemistry at Pratt Institute and studied art with the painter William Merritt Chase. \nShe began to create hooked rugs at home, getting taught the basics by the older women in the town, raising funds for the Methodist church and the town library. Some reports say she was inspired on to this path from finding an old loom in her home's attic. As her livelihood progressed, she was always looking for old looms and frames in the region's barns, sheds, and attics, many having been no longer used after the Industrial Revolution.\nFisk partnered with Anna Bailey Smith, the wife of Vermont governor Edward Curtis Smith. Smith introduced Fisk to other dyeing options and encouraged Fisk to experiment with colors and move on from simple rugs to more complex textiles. She also brought Fisk's work to a larger audience, writing about her in Ladies' Home Journal in 1923. Fisk branched out into creating other domestic household textiles primarily in linen including bedspreads, table runners, pillow cases, placemats, and curtains. Hand-woven linen was a rarity by the end of the 1800s. She created weaving techniques that produced designs on both sides of the woven fabrics so that \"[I]t was nearly impossible to tell the right from the wrong side.\" Her designs were \"symmetrical and centrally balanced and featured natural motifs like flowers, plants, and animals.\"\n\n\n== Elizabeth Fisk Looms ==\nFisk originally had encouraged other local women to create their own textile products which could bring in money. She created Elizabeth Fisk Looms, a cottage industry for a small group of women weavers. The company consisted of two studios, one in Isle la Motte and one in nearby St. Albans (run by Smith) beginning in 1910. Designs for patterns were always original and were create with a customer's specific color palette in mind. A sign outside the St. Albans studio read \"Linen Weaving. Original Designs in Color.\" The textiles were popular in their time, being exhibited around the United States. Fisk Looms created a Vermont coat of arms which was presented to the General Federation of Women's Clubs in Washington D.C. A duplicate of this weaving hung in the Vermont State House. The Chicago Art Institute awarded her a bronze medal along with a \"purse of gold.\".\nFisk died in 1927, leaving the looms to her workers who formed a guild and continued to work and publicize their techniques. Fisk Looms continued to thrive for another seven years, finally closing in 1935 after the death of Smith and the scarcity of raw materials during World War II. Textiles that these looms created are in collections such as The University of Vermont's Fleming Museum and the collections of the Vermont Historical Society.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Indy Eleven season is the current season for Indy Eleven, a professional soccer club based in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is also the club's eleventh season of existence, their eleventh consecutive season in the second tier of American soccer, and their seventh season in the USL Championship. The team also participated in the U.S. Open Cup.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe previous season was the second consecutive season where the USL played a 34-match schedule divided into two conferences with both conferences having a single table. While being the first where all sides from both conferences played against each other.\nThe 2023 season was seen as relatively successful for Indy, as they qualified for the USL Championship Playoffs for the first time since 2019 by finishing 6th in the Eastern Conference. The team lost to eventual finalists Charleston Battery in the Conference Quarterfinals on October 22, 2023. The team exited the U.S. Open Cup in the third round with a 1–0 away loss to MLS side Columbus Crew on April 26, 2023.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2023 season the club parted ways with head coach Mark Lowry, who later became the head coach for MLS Next Pro side Real Monarchs. The team announced the arrival of former Manchester United player and Minnesota United interim head coach Sean McAuley as their new head coach on January 8, 2024.\n\n\n== Roster ==\nAs of match played April 27, 2024\n\n\n== Non-competitive ==\n\n\n=== Preseason ===\nThe Eleven released their preseason schedule on January 19, 2024. Six games were announced, four home games and two away games. The Eleven faced clubs in the USL Championship, MLS Next Pro, USL League One, and one collegiate team.\n\nThe Eleven concluded their preseason games following a 3–1 victory over Detroit City on February 29. They ended their preseason series undefeated with five wins and one draw, and a +16 goal differential.\n\n\n== Competitive ==\n\n\n=== USL Championship ===\n\n\n==== Standings ====\n\n\n==== Match results ====\nThe league announced the 34 week regular season campaign for every club on December 18, 2023. Indy began their season away to Western Conference side Oakland Roots on March 9, with their home opener taking place in week three against Sacramento Republic on March 23.\n\nThe season consists of 34 matches, with the Eleven playing home and away against each Eastern Conference opponent. Indy will face expansion club Rhode Island FC for the first time ever on July 5, and will also play matches against North Carolina FC for the first time since 2020 on April 27. The top 8 teams in the Eastern Conference will qualify for the 2024 USL Championship playoffs.\n\n\n=== U.S. Open Cup ===\n\nAs a member of the USL Championship, Indy Eleven entered the U.S. Open Cup tournament in the third round. The Eleven qualified for the Round of 32 for the first time since 2016 with a 1–0 victory over the Chicago Fire FC II on April 17, the team's first away victory in the U.S. Open Cup and their first shutout of the season.\n\nThe draw for the Round of 32 took place on April 18, with the Eleven hosting fellow USL Championship club San Antonio FC at home on May 8. The winner of that match will advance to play either Detroit City FC or MLS side Houston Dynamo in the Round of 16. On April 18, the Eleven announced that the match against San Antonio will be played at the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Appearances and goals ===\nAs of as of match played April 27, 2024.\n\n\n=== Disciplinary record ===\n\n\n=== Clean sheets ===\n\n\n=== Goals ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== Kits ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndy Eleven\nList of Indy Eleven seasons\n2024 in American soccer\n2024 USL Championship season\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Swainsona paradoxa is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to inland Western Australia. It is a prostrate or ascending perennial or annual herb with imparipinnate leaves with up to 9 mostly broadly egg-shaped leaflets and racemes of 2 to 20 purple, pink or white flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona paradoxa is a prostrate or ascending perennial or annual plant, that rarely grows to a height of 20 cm (7.9 in) and has many stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 10–120 mm (0.39–4.72 in) long with up to 9 broadly egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, the side leaflets up to 25 mm (0.98 in) long and 15 mm (0.59 in) wide with stipules mostly 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, pink or white, arranged in racemes of 2 to 20, 50–250 mm (2.0–9.8 in) long, on a peduncle 0.5–3 mm (0.020–0.118 in) wide. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 1.5 mm (0.059 in) long, with lobes shorter than the tube. The standard petal is 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long and up to about 12 mm (0.47 in) wide, the wings 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) long and the keel about 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) deep. Flowering occurs in April or May, or from July to September, and the fruit is a pod 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long on a stalk about 1 mm (0.039 in) long, with the remains of the strongly curved style 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona paradoxa was first formally described in 1904 by William Vincent Fitzgerald and the description was published in the Journal of the West Australian Natural History Society from specimens he found near the margins of a salt lake near Nannine. The specific epithet (paradoxa) means \"unexpected\" or \"strange\", referring to the fruit.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of pea grows on the edges of salt lakes or salt flats in the Coolgardie, Gascoyne and Murchison bioregions of inland Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

The album contains 18 songs that were recorded during A-Mei's tenure at Forward Music, but were never released. It also contains a bonus CD of eight English cover songs. The album sold over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and 1 million copies in Asia.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis is a collection of unreleased songs from A-Mei's time at Forward Music. Reasons for not releasing these songs include: a song with a distinctly different style from the album, difficulty in choosing a song with the same style, or even the post-production period couldn't catch up with the release date. Forward Music had repeatedly emphasized that producing the Journey album for A-Mei was like making a graduation album, and watching A-Mei become a super diva from a novice in the singing world.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "May I Kill U? is a 2012 British black comedy film directed by Stuart Urban.  A horror-edged satire of British right-wing politics and the idea of a Broken Britain, the film follows a police constable and rogue vigilante cyclist (played by comedian Kevin Bishop) who gains social media fame serial killing \"scumbags\" and posting the videos on YouTube and Twitter.  The film debuted at the FrightFest film festival in 2012 before receiving a theatrical release in the United Kingdom in 2013 and a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2014, where it received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMay I Kill U? received largely scathing reviews from critics, with only a small number of less negative reviews.  The film holds a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7 out of 100 score (indicating \"Universal dislike or disgust\") on Metacritic.\nReviews from British critics were overwhelmingly negative.  The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw described May I Kill U? as \"one of those British indie films that come nowhere near the standard of the most ordinary telly drama.\"  A separate Guardian review from Philip French was one of the film's only positive reviews, describing the film as \"funny, sharp and ruthless.\"  Empire stated: \"Setting out to be a killer-cop satire for the social media age, the result makes Paul Blart look like Taxi Driver.  Unfollow immediately.\"  Total Film described May I Kill U? as \"a satire so blunt it makes an early - but compelling - case for most misguided film of 2013.\"  The List opined that \"There's little actual humour in May I Kill U?, just a grim view of police-work, deprivation, social media and modern life generally.\"  The Daily Telegraph stated that \"There may well be a worse film released this year than this unwatchable British black comedy, although it sets a terrifyingly low benchmark.\"  The Daily Express described the film as \"a tacky, low-budget film that is as blunt and obvious as the instruments Baz uses on his victims.\"  The Evening Standard stated that \"The joke barely lasts the film’s short running time, but that is mitigated by performances from Bishop, Frances Barber as his slovenly mum and Rosemary Leach as an old lady who beats him at his own game.\"  The Sun described the film as \"a dumb farce which is neither funny or scary.\"  Little White Lies described the film as \"A spoof of right-wing reactionary politics that feels better suited to television than cinema\" and stated: \"At times, it feels like a relative of superlative Belgian serial killer comedy, Man Bites Dog, though a rather toothless distant cousin.  Urban’s film trades in absurdist humour and knowing clichés but never ventures into the darker territory the material is calling out for.  May I Kill U? looks very much like it was made for Channel 4 as post-pub fodder.\"  Metro called the film \"a flat-footed satire of the London riots\".  Contactmusic.com awarded the film 3 stars out of 5, stating: \"A pitch-black sense of humour provides some strong laughs in this satirical British thriller, but the undercooked script never manages to hold onto our interest. Packed with coincidences and contrivances, the story is just too sloppy, even if there's a provocative point worth making in here somewhere.\"  On Kermode and Mayo's Film Review, BBC film critic Mark Kermode called the film \"one of the most ill-judged films of recent memory\".  Starburst gave the film one of its few positive reviews, saying \"May I Kill U? is not at all what you might expect it to be.  It’s witty, snappily directed, surprisingly dark and unexpectedly sad at times.  This very English Bad Lieutenant is a Trending Topic U really should keep your eye on.\"\nInternational critics were generally no more forgiving.  The Village Voice stated that \"Urban's stab at black-comedy satire is hobbled by the obviousness of his characters.\"  The Los Angeles Times opened its review of the film with \"The only real response to a thuddingly unfunny vigilante satire like 'May I Kill U' is, 'Well, I hope that filmmaker got something out of his system.'\"  A positive review came from Film Threat, which called the film \"a dark commentary on both the social media fed society at large, and a skewed, contemporary take on the superhero origin story\" and stated that \"the film is visually quite creative and fun to watch.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nMay I Kill U? at IMDb \nMay I Kill U? at AllMovie\nMay I Kill U? at Rotten Tomatoes\nMay I Kill U? at Metacritic",

        "content": "The Old Town Hall was a municipal building in the High Street in Rickmansworth, a town in Hertfordshire, in England. The upper floors have been demolished and the ground floor is now in retail use.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1860s, a group of local businessmen decided to form a company, known as the Rickmansworth Town Hall Company, to finance and commission a town hall for the town. The site they selected, on the south side of the High Street, was occupied by the old Market Hall, which had become very dilapidated. The site was donated to the directors by the lord of the manor, John Saunders Gilliat, whose residence was at The Cedars in Rickmansworth.\nThe new building was designed by Arthur Allum of Westminster in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick with Bath stone dressings at a cost of £1,200 and was officially opened in December 1869. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of two bays facing onto the High Street. The left-hand bay featured an arched doorway with an archivolt, surmounted by a lamp which projected over the pavement. The right-hand bay on the ground floor and both bays on the first floor were fenestrated by casement windows with stone surrounds. There was an additional storey in the left-hand bay at attic level, fenestrated by a small square window and surmounted by a stepped gable with a finial. Internally, the principal room was an assembly hall, which was 56 feet (17 m) long and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide and which featured a hammerbeam roof. It was used for dances, concerts, lectures, and monthly meetings of the Penny Reading Society.\nAn inquiry was held in February 1896 at the hall, to consider whether to establish an urban district. This proposal went ahead, and the first meeting of Rickmansworth Urban District Council was held at the Town Hall on 16 April 1898. In 1912, the assembly hall was converted into an auditorium to facilitate its use as a cinema known as the Electric Picture Playhouse, with a capacity of 300 people.  It was later renamed the Electric Palace, but it closed as a cinema in 1927.\nMeanwhile, the urban district council relocated to the former home of William Penn at Basing House, on the north side of the High Street in 1930. The auditorium behind the old town hall was later demolished, along with the upper part of the town hall facade. The lower part of the facade was altered to create two shop fronts, while a two-storey office block was built on the site of the auditorium behind.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Ashbourne took place, near Ashbourne, County Meath, during the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916. The Rising, also known as the Easter Rebellion, was an armed insurrection in Ireland during Easter Week in April 1916. The Rising was launched by Irish republicans against British rule in Ireland with the aim of establishing an independent Irish Republic. It was the first armed conflict of the Irish revolutionary period. The Battle of Ashbourne would be the only significant conflict to occur outside Dublin.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nIn north County Dublin, about 60 Volunteers mobilised near Swords. They belonged to the 5th Battalion of the Dublin Brigade (also known as the Fingal Battalion), and were led by Thomas Ashe and his second in command, Richard Mulcahy. Unlike the rebels elsewhere, the Fingal Battalion successfully employed guerrilla tactics. They set up camp and Ashe split the battalion into four sections: three would undertake operations while the fourth was kept in reserve, guarding camp and foraging for food. The Volunteers moved against the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks in Swords, Donabate and Garristown, forcing the RIC to surrender and seizing all the weapons. They also damaged railway lines and cut telegraph wires. The railway line at Blanchardstown was bombed to prevent a troop train from reaching Dublin. This derailed a cattle train, which had been sent ahead of the troop train.\n\n\n== The Battle ==\nOn Friday, about 35 Fingal Volunteers surrounded the Ashbourne RIC barracks and called on it to surrender, but the RIC responded with a volley of gunfire. A firefight followed, and the RIC surrendered after the Volunteers attacked the building with a homemade grenade. Before the surrender could be taken, up to sixty RIC men arrived in a convoy, sparking a five-hour gun battle, in which eight RIC men were killed and 18 wounded. Two Volunteers were also killed and five wounded, and a civilian was fatally shot. The RIC surrendered and were disarmed. Ashe let them go after warning them not to fight against the Irish Republic again.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAshe's men camped at Kilsalaghan near Dublin until they received orders to surrender on Saturday. The Fingal Battalion's tactics during the Rising foreshadowed those of the IRA during the War of Independence that followed.\nVolunteer contingents also mobilised nearby in counties Meath and Louth but proved unable to link up with the North Dublin unit until after it had surrendered. In County Louth, Volunteers shot dead an RIC man near the village of Castlebellingham on 24 April, in an incident in which 15 RIC men were also taken prisoner.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nThen President of Ireland, Seán T. O'Kelly, unveiled a memorial at Rath Cross Roads, Ashbourne, on Easter Sunday, 26 April 1959 to commemorate the Battle of Ashbourne. The story was covered on the front page of the Irish Times the next day. The memorial, designed by Con O'Reilly and Peter Grant, commemorates the battle and John Crenigan and Thomas Rafferty who were killed. The monument has two images: on one side the figure is in the form of Christ, and on the other side is a rebel.\nOn Easter Monday 2016, Rath Cross was the location of one of a number of 1916 centenary commemoration events.  In September 2016, the monument was expanded with the addition of two side figures; one representing the Volunteers in uniform, the other a family.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMcGarry, Fearghal (2010).

        "content": "Ward Clinton Swank (November 10, 1885 – June 2, 1949) was a Virginia lawyer and politician who served for a decade in the Virginia Senate, then for nearly a decade as mayor of Harrisonburg, Virginia during the Great Depression.\n\n\n== Early and family life ==\nBorn near Edom in Rockingham County, the youngest of at least ten children of the former Mary Elizabeth Horn (1847–1917) and her husband John Perry Swank (1833–1918). In the 18th century, Mennonite Swank (a/k/a Shank or Schwenk) ancestors had emigrated from Switzerland and various German states and established farms in then-developing Rockingham County, and for centuries had intermarried with other long-established Germanic families in the Shenandoah Valley including the Horns. His paternal grandfather, John  Swank had married Mary Acker. Although named only in postwar rosters, his farm laborer father, who clearly married his mother in 1863, may have renounced the Mennonites' pacifist teachings and served as a private in the 7th Virginia Cavalry late in the conflict.\nVirginia's public schools were established after the conflict, and Ward Swank attended the Rockingham County public schools, graduating from Harrisonburg High School in 1908. He then traveled to Charlottesville to attend the University of Virginia, from which he received a bachelor's degree in 1911, and also participated in the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the Imp society. He graduated from the University of Virginia Law School in 1913.\nSwank attended officer candidate school during World War I, then sat on the local draft board, and later became active in the American Legion. As 1918 ended, Shank married Elsie R. Miller (1894–1991) of Stephens City in Frederick County at the Shenandoah Valley's northern end, and who had graduated from the State Normal School (teacher's college) in Harrisonburg in 1917. She outlived him by decades, and bore two daughters during the marriage, Carolyn Miller (b. 1925) and Janice Newton (b. 1930).\n\n\n== Career ==\nAdmitted to the Virginia bar in 1913, he began a private practice which later caused him to become local counsel for the Federal Land Bank of Baltimore, the B&O Railroad, the Southern Railway Co., the Norfolk and Western Railway Co., the Virginia State Highway Department, Merck & Company, Inc. and The National Bank of Harrisonburg. He was also active in the Masons, Elks, Phi Kappa Psi and Presbyterian Church (although his grandfather was an early Lutheran settler in the area).\nBeginning in 1916, when Harrisonburg (the county seat for Rockingham County, which surrounds it) received its charter as an independent city in Virginia, through 1932, Swank served as clerk of the Harrisonburg City Council. He grew to know John Paul, the city attorney after 1919.\nA Democrat as had been his father (one of his brothers was named after Samuel J. Tilden), Swank became chairman of the Rockingham County Democratic organization, and in 1922 ran for the Virginia Senate after Paul (a Republican) resigned to run for the U.S. House of Representatives (although successful after an election contest, Paul failed to win re-election, and in 1929 would become U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, then in the waning days of the Republican Hoover administration through Massive Resistance, the judge for that district).\nAlthough Swank's senatorial district grew geographically following reapportionment after the 1920 census which added Clarke and Warren counties to the north, Swank won re-election and continued to win re-election until 1932, when he instead ran (successfully) for Mayor of Harrisonburg. Fellow Democrat and Warren County lawyer Aubrey G. Weaver succeeded Swank as state senator, and the city continued to support Democrats until 1944. Swank also won re-election as mayor until 1936, and again after 1938. However, John W. Morrison and Raymond Dingledine held the office for several months in 1937, then upon being re-elected in 1938 Swank appointed a special council committee which recommended appointment of a city manager. During his mayoral term, the city limits were extended and progressive government improvements made. He also cooperated with federal authorities in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a fellow Democrat, to arrange for public works projects to benefit the unemployed of Harrisonburg and the surrounding area.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSwank died in 1949.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kurdistan Society's Freedom Movement or Tevgerî Azadiyî (Kurdish: تەڤگەری ئازادیی کۆمەڵگەی کوردستان, romanized: Tevgerî Azadiyî Komelgeyî Kurdistan), is a registered political party active in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. It was founded in 2014 in Silêmanî and received an official license in 2018. In the Kurdistan Region, however, they applied for a license but didn't receive an answer from either the Silêmanî Governorate or the interior ministry of the region.\nThe party's slogan is \"Democracy, gender equity, environmental protection\". At the third party congress in July 2022 in Silêmanî, over a thousand members were reportedly present.\n\n\n== Assassinations of party members and repression ==\nThe party repeatedly faced assassinations and repression from authorities. On 25 October 2016, the party claimed that security forces in Zakho confiscated the house of Hesen Salih Zaxoyî, a member of the party leadership, and arrested him alongside two of his sons and a guest.\nIn November 2018, the Kurdistan Regional Government ordered the closure of all party offices in Silêmanî and Halabja Governorates, as well as in Raperîn and Germiyan. The decision was justified by the closure of any offices of parties without official license in the Kurdistan Region. The party criticized however, that they had handed in all required documents for receiving a license to the authorities, but not received any answer. The party also claimed that their members would be subjected to harassment from security forces on a daily base, including extrajudicial arrests.\nIn March 2019, the party offices in Silêmanî were reopened after talks between the party and security officials. In 2024 however, the party met for a talk with the chair of the Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council, Fayeq Zedan, because of the ban on its activities in the governorates Silêmanî and Erbil.\nIn September 2019, the party again criticized that the security forces of the Kurdistan Democratic Party have been arresting, interrogating and prosecuting its members in Bahdinan and Soran. They also claimed the KDP-controlled security would pressure members to leave the party and stop to criticize the occupation of Turkey in the north of the region. The party called this restriction of political freedoms as an alarming step towards dictatorship and sees it as an act of pandering to Turkey.\nIn 2022, Suheyl Xurşîd Ezîz, a member of the party's executive council and employee of the local agricultural authority, was shot dead with several bullets by an unknown assailant in front of his home in Kifri, a town in the Disputed territories of northern Iraq.\nOn 18 January 2024, the party member Feryal Silêman Xalid was assassinated in the city of Kirkuk. The woman, who was born in Syria, was killed by an unknown assailant on a motor bike. The following day, the party released a statement calling on the security forces to arrest the attacker and said that the Islamic State and Turkey had conspired to massacre Kurds, also referring to an assassination carried out by the IS against a police officer in Kirkuk a few days earlier.\n\n\n== Positions and statements ==\n\n\n=== Ideology ===\nAbout the relationship with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, co-chair Tara Husên said that Tevgerî Azadiyî is an independent party that does not receive decisions from any other party. However, Husên also confirmed that the party is influenced by the philosophy of Abdullah Öcalan.\n\n\n=== Domestic politics and societal issues ===\nAccording to co-chair Tara Husên, core values of the party are centered around gender equality and environmentalism. The party also wants to distance itself from most nationalist forces, as it considers a diverse society with different communities as a positive factor. The party also strives to achieve \"self-government\" of the people after the ideals of Democratic confederalism. It sees an important role of women and the youth in this political struggle, as these groups wouldn't get any leadership roles in the established parties and would instead only receive empty promises. Tara Husên also describes Tevgerî Azadiyî as not being a classical political party but rather a \"socio-political movement\".\nThe concluding statement of the party conference in Kirkuk 2022 included aims like the promotion of a system of democratic decentralization, combatting violence against women and supporting female leadership and self-organization as well as protection of the environment, historical monuments and holy shrines. Because of marginalization, joblessness and loss of hope among the younger population, causing many of them to emigrate, Tevgerî Azadiyî has a particular focus on reaching and organizing this milieu of people. The party also announced support for enlarging green spaces in cities and buying local to help the rural population.\nAt a congress by members in Europe in 2023, the party warned about the dangerous and growing societal influence of Islamism, which it sees as manifested by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic State and Salafism. It accuses these groups of fostering a hateful mentality in the society that targets women and the rights and freedoms of the people in general. The party also stated that it supports cooperation with all parties committed to freedom and democracy, the release of the imprisoned Abdullah Öcalan and the societal liberation of women.\n\n\n=== Regional conflicts ===\nIn March 2020, the party commemorated the Halabja massacre of 1988, which it sees as part of what it calls a genocide against the Kurds. The root causes of this it sees in the mentality of ethnocentrism fostered by nation states and argues that the same mentality also caused the Yazidi genocide in Şingal, the massacres in Cizre and the historical Sur district of Diyarbakir, the Turkish occupation of Afrin and marginalization of Kurds in Kirkuk.\nOn a speech at a party conference in Kirkuk 2022, Komel Sermed, co-chair of the party in the city accused Iraq of leading a policy of Arabization in Kirkuk, claiming that Kurdish villages in the surrounding land would be evacuated after threats and then settled with Arabs. He also accused Turkey and the Iraqi Turkmen Front of trying to turkify Kirkuk's historical landmarks.\nIn March 2024, the party released a statement in which it called the Turkish state fascist and criticized the Kurdistan Democratic Party as collaborators. It called on the Iraqi state to stop the crimes of Turkish forces and punish those who collaborate with it.\n\n\n=== Protests ===\nThe party announced support for the demands of the 2020 Kurdish protests in Sulaymaniyah Governorate and condemned the violent response of the security forces, accusing the KRG of unwise, undemocratic and neglectful to its people. It referred to the killed protesters as martyrs and said that it shares the grief of their families.\nEqually during the students' protests 2021, co-chair Tara Husên said on a press conference in Silêmanî that the party supports the protesters' demands. She accused the KRG of being responsible for the situation of the students and called on the authorities to release the detained protesters as soon as possible. Husên also lauded the tenaciousness of the students despite their economic misery and said that they are informed enough to insist on their demands because they know who is responsible. Tevgerî Azadiyî also demanded, that the student's grants should not only be kept but increased and that students should be allowed to form independent councils to represent themselves.\n\n\n== Electoral activities and alliances ==\nIn the 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election, the party had run on a list together with the New Generation Movement. This alliance was not repeated in the 2021 Iraqi parliamentary election. Yusra Receb Kemir, an MP who was expelled from the parliamentary faction of the New Generation in 2020, was running as an independent in the 2021 elections and along three other independent candidates was endorsed by Tevgerî Azadiyî.\nIn the 2023 Kirkuk governorate election, the party called on its supporters to vote for the united electoral list of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Communist Party - Iraq. It also stressed the importance that all would Kurds participate in the elections, as the elections also serve as a historical document of the ethnic makeup of the Kirkuk Governorate.\n\n\n== 1 September 2023 Erbil attack controversy ==\nOn 1 September 2023, a bombing in took place on a pedestrian bridge in Erbil. There were no casualties or wounded persons, but material damage occurred. The security council of the Government of Kurdistan Region called this an \"act of terrorism\" and claimed that Zalil Jalil Khalaf, a member of Tevgerî Azadiyî from Chamchamal would be responsible. The party however denied the accusations, stating that the perpetrator unknown to them and has nothing to do with them. In the statement, it also accused the KRG of trying to deflect from the ongoing protests by teachers and other public servants for receiving months of yet unpaid salaries. It stressed that it is a licensed party in Iraq that carries out its political and civil struggle for democratization within the framework of the law.\n\n\n== References ==",

It concerns the transparency of companies regarding their use of copyrighted work to train their generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. The legislation requires the submission of a notice regarding the identity and the uniform resource locator (URL) address of the copyrighted works used in the training data to the Register of Copyrights at least 30 days before the public release of the new or updated version of the AI model; it does not ban the use of copyrighted works for AI training. The bill's requirements would apply retroactively to prior AI models.\nViolation penalties would start at US$5,000. The legislation does not have a maximum penalty assessment that can be charged.\nThe bill by Schiff was introduced a few days after The New York Times published an article regarding the business activities of major tech firms, including Google and Meta, in the training of their generative AI platforms on April 6, 2024.\nThe legislation is supported by the Professional Photographers of America (PPA), SAG-AFTRA, the Writers Guild of America, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and others.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hu Hetao (simplified Chinese: 胡荷韬; traditional Chinese: 胡荷韜; pinyin: Hú Hétāo; born 5 October 2003) is a Chinese professional footballer who plays as a left wing-back for Chinese Super League club Chengdu Rongcheng.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Wanzhou, Chongqing, Hu Hetao attended Chongqing Yucai Secondary School until 2018, prior to starting a professional football career. In 2022, after spending the few years prior preparing for Gaokao, he was called up to the Chengdu Rongcheng first-team.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBefore the 2022 Chinese Super League season, Hu Hetao was named in Chengdu Rongcheng's 31-man first-team squad, to which Hu Hetao reacts as \"fulfilling his dream.\" He made his professional debut in the Chinese Super League on 4 June 2022 in a match against Shenzhen, playing 74 minutes as a starter at left wing-back. He scored his first senior goal a month later on 11 July 2022, providing an equalising goal after coming on as a substitute, to see Chengdu Rongcheng eventually turn the game around, winning 2–1 away against Meizhou Hakka. After putting in a good shift against Wuhan Three Towns on 23 December 2022, Hu Hetao was selected as the CSL's Player of the Round. After a successful debut season with Chengdu Rongcheng, he was shortlisted as a candidate for the club's player of the season.\nIn the 2023 season, Hu Hetao was regularly called up to the China U20 and the China U23 national teams, participating in months-long national team training camps. As a result, he could not find consistent game time at club level, and caused a steep dip in his form, only managing eight appearances in all competitions throughout the season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn February 2023, Hu was selected as part of the China U20 squad for the 2023 AFC U-20 Asian Cup. Throughout the year of 2023, Hu Hetao was called up to several months-long training camps at the U20 and the U23 levels.\nOn 5 April 2024, Hu was included in the China U23 squad for the 2024 AFC U-23 Asian Cup.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHu Hetao was a ball boy at the 2021 Chinese FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of 12 August 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHu Hetao at Soccerway",

        "content": "1272 in France\n1272 in France marked a period within the medieval era characterized by significant political and social developments under the Capetian dynasty. This entry provides an overview of the major events and notable figures of the year.\nEvents\nKingdom Leadership: The year saw Louis IX (Saint Louis) succeeded by his son, Philip III, who had ascended to the throne in the preceding year, 1271, following the death of Louis IX during the Eighth Crusade in 1270. Philip III's reign marked the continuation of Capetian authority and the consolidation of royal power.\nEconomic Developments: In 1272, France continued to develop its internal economy, with expansions in trade and agriculture. The ongoing growth of urban centers and the establishment of new market privileges reflected the deepening of economic networks across the kingdom.\nCultural Impact: This period was significant in the propagation of Gothic architecture, with the ongoing construction and enhancement of cathedrals and public buildings, which symbolized the growing influence and wealth of the French nobility and the Church.\nMilitary Campaigns: Philip III might have engaged in or planned for military campaigns to strengthen the French territories or to address conflicts with neighboring principalities, reflecting the ongoing feudal tensions of the period.\nSignificant Figures\nPhilip III (the Bold): Ruling from 1270 to 1285, his policies and leadership style continued to shape the political landscape of France. His reign was characterized by efforts to strengthen royal authority and manage the complex feudal loyalties and obligations.\nNotable Nobles and Advisers: The court of Philip III included several influential figures such as Simon de Clermont and Pierre de la Broce, who played pivotal roles in the administrative and military operations of the kingdom.\nCultural Developments\nLiterature and Learning: The influence of the University of Paris (Sorbonne) continued to grow, with an increasing number of scholars contributing to theological, philosophical, and scientific discussions, which were integral to the intellectual revival of the 13th century.\nArt and Architecture: Gothic art continued to evolve with notable advancements in stained glass techniques and illuminated manuscripts, which were prominent in religious and secular institutions.\nConclusion\nThe year 1272 was a year of consolidation and transition for France, laying down structures and systems that would define the late medieval period. Under the rule of Philip III, France continued to assert its dominance and cultural influence across Europe",

        "content": "Ella Virginia Aldrich Schwing (October 24, 1902 – February 21, 1982) was an American librarian, professor, and pioneer of library user instruction. She is known for her textbook Using Books and Libraries. She also served on the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors.\n\n\n== Early career and education ==\nElla V. Aldrich Schwing was born on October 24, 1902, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Lawson Burfoot Aldrich, a lawyer, and Ella Leonard (née Lanier) Aldrich. She attended Baton Rouge High School. She graduated with a B.A. in English and chemistry from Louisiana State University in 1923. Aldrich worked as an English teacher for one year in Brusly High School in West Baton Rouge Parish. She continued to work in Baton Rouge public schools for several years. In 1926, Aldrich served as the first director of the Baton Rouge Girl Scouts\nIn 1930, Aldrich received a B.S. in library science from Columbia University. In 1931, she received an M.A. in comparative literature from Louisiana State University. During her graduate studies, she worked part-time in the circulation department of Hill Memorial Library. In 1931, she worked briefly as a catalog librarian at Sara Lawrence College in New York before returning to Louisiana State University as part of the library staff in September of that year.\nIn 1935, she was one of ten recipients (and the only woman) of the American Library Association's traveling library fellowships to visit and study county regional libraries in the United States and Canada. As part of the fellowship, she spent a summer at Columbia University studying under Essae Martha Culver and Lyman Bryson.\n\n\n== Library user instruction ==\nIn 1936, after the fellowship tour, Aldrich began teaching a one-credit course, required for all freshman, in the use of libraries. To accompany the course, she authored the textbook Using Books and Libraries, modified in later editions for use in any academic library. One of the first of its kind, the textbook received positive reviews and saw wide adoption in first-year library instruction throughout the US.\nIn conjunction with her freshman course, Aldrich established the Department of Books and Libraries within the College of Arts and Sciences and served as its head from 1936 to 1947. She also was an assistant professor in the university's Library School.\nIn 1963, Aldrich coauthored with Thomas Edward Camp, a Librarian from The University of the South, the textbook Using Theological Books and Libraries, with much content adapted from Aldrich's previous textbook.\n\n\n== Professional service and recognition ==\nAldirch was active in the American Library Association Junior Members Round Table, including serving on the Committee on Library Information Leaflets. In 1936, she was appointed Southwest District Secretary for the Junior section. In the main organization, she was Chairman of the ALA Membership Committee during the early 1940s. Aldrich was President of the Louisiana Library Association from 1940 to 1941. She served on the American Library Association Council from 1946 to 1947 as well as the Library Committee of the World Trade Association. She also served as the regional director of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions. In 1959, she was State Vice Chairman of the Louisiana Heart Association and established a memorial heart research fund in honor of her late husband, Calvin K Schwing, who died of a heart attack on October 24, 1955. She was selected as an associate member of Theta Sigma Phi and named one of five patronesses in the Baton Rouge area at the 1960 Theta Sigma Phi Matrix banquet.\nIn 1952, Aldrich was appointed to the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University. She served early in her term during a controversial debate over a proposed enlargement of Tiger Stadium in 1953. Aldrich proposed that the board go on record in favor of allocating funds for a new library instead of the stadium project, which was facing widespread student and faculty opposition, but her motion was unsuccessful.\nAldrich made several monetary contributions to the university libraries including a $1,000 donation to the Friends of the LSU Libraries in 1963 and a donation of a $25,000 life insurance policy on herself with the main library as the beneficiary.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nElla V. Aldrich Schwing died on February 21, 1982, in Baton Rouge.\nIn 1981, the LSU Library Lecture series was renamed the Schwing Library Lecture Series. Aldrich had sponsored the series since 1966.\nIn 1990, Aldrich's one-credit freshman course in library usage was still being taught at LSU as a general elective and requirement for some departments.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tree of Jesse is an egg tempera painting by Victor. Victor was a Cretan painter active during the Late Cretan School from 1650 to 1697.  He traveled all over the Venetian empire and eventually settled in Zakinthos.  He represents the Late Cretan School and the early Heptanese School of painting.  The painter features an enormous amount of existing works. His catalog of art exceeds over ninety-five paintings.  He painted several versions of the Tree of Jesse and Christ the Vine. \nJesse of Bethlehem was the father of King David.  The Tree of Jesse is the original use of the family tree as a schematic representation of genealogy and originated in a passage from the biblical Book of Isaiah. The book describes the descent of the Messiah (Mashiach) and the tree is the depiction in art of the ancestors of Jesus Christ.  According to Luke's Gospel, chapter 3, Jesus is traced back, via Nathan to David and then on to \"Adam, which was [the son] of God.\". (Luke 3:23–38) Matthew's Gospel also says: \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" (Matthew 1:1).   \nThe Tree of Jesse (Ρίζα του Ιεσσαί) has appeared numerous times in Greek Italian Byzantine art and it depicts the ancestral Davidic line of Jesus Christ.  One of the earliest known sculpted versions of the Tree of Jesse was completed by Italian sculptor Lorenzo Maitani in the 14th century for Orvieto Cathedral Umbria, Italy.  Several illuminated manuscripts from the 12th century also feature the Tree of Jesse.  Northern European painters adopted the theme in the 15th century German painter Absolon Stumme completed his work entitled Tree of Jesse in 1499 and Dutch painter Jan Mostaert finished his work Tree of Jesse in 1500.  Both works feature Abraham as the root of the tree.  Cretan painters began to adopt the theme, Theophanes the Cretan finished his Tree of Jesse for the Agia Trapeza in the middle of the 1500s for the Monastery of Great Lavra in Mount Athos and by the 1600s dozens of Cretan painters began to depict the Tree of Jesse.  Theodore Poulakis completed his version of the Tree of Jesse in 1666 and Victor completed his work eight years afterward.  That same year in 1674 he also finished his rendition of Christ the Vine (Victor).  The current work of art is located at the Hellenic Institute of Venice in Venice, Italy.  \n\n\n== Description ==\nTree of Jesse is a tempera painting on gold leaf and wood panel. The height is 52 cm (20.4 in) and the width is 40.3 cm (15.9 in).  It is almost identical in size to Victor's Christ the Vine which was completed the same year.  The icon features the ancestral Davidic line of Jesus Christ and is the pictorial representation of the former Kings of Israel.  Luckily the painter labeled each figure with the Greek inscription of their names.  The biblical figures include from the top left Solomon (Σολομών) the central figure is King David with the traditional Greek symbols (ΑΔΑ) and Asa of Judah (Ασασ) is to our right of King David.  From the second row to the left, the first figure is Rehoboam (Ροβοάμ), he is seated next to Abijah of Judah (Αβιασ), across from the two figures are Jehoshaphat (Ἰωσαφάτ) and Jehoram of Judah (Ἰωράμ). The next row below features two figures, on the left Uzziah (Ὀζίας) is seated across from Hezekiah (Εζεκίας) to our right.  The next four figures below to our left are Ahaz (Ἄχαζ) next to Jotham (Ιωαθαμ), across from them to the right are Manasseh of Judah (Μανασσῆς) next to Amon of Judah (Αμών).  At the bottom of the tree at the root is Abraham (Αβραάμ).  The central figures are the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ.  The work also features branches symbolizing the True Vine.  The Virgin is in her traditional garb the red tunic and blue mantle.  The position of the Madonna and Child is the traditional Our Lady of the Sign also known as Platitera and in Italian Nostra Signora del Segno. Sometimes it is also referred to as the Nikopoios.  Only two Kings adorn crowns Solomon and David and Abraham is the root of the tree as seen in other renditions of the Tree of Jesse.  The work was signed (ΧΕΙΡ ΒΙΚΤΩΡΟΣ ΑΧΟΔ by the hand of Victor 1674)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Manuscripts ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nHatzidakis, Manolis (1987).

        "content": "Early Greek cosmology refers to beliefs about the structure (cosmography) and origins (cosmogony) of the cosmos (Greek kosmos) primarily from the 8th to 5th centuries BC before it was superseded by ancient Greek astronomy, which was demythologized and involved the systematic of the world. The main features of early Greek cosmography are shared with those found in ancient near eastern cosmology. The basic elements of the cosmos include (a flat) earth, heaven, the sea, and the netherworld (Tartarus), the first three of which corresponded to the gods Gaia, Ouranos, and Oceanus (or Pontos). \nSome primary sources for early Greek cosmology include the poetry of Homer (the Iliad and the Odyssey), Hesiod (the Theogony and the Works and Days), and surviving fragments from Mimnermus.\nIn the 5th century BC, Greek thinkers began to add new features to this cosmology. One, advocated by figures including Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Empedocles advocated the view that the kosmos as a whole (and not the Earth in particular) was spherical. Empedocles and Anaxagoras advocated for a notion called \"vortex\", which describes a rotation of the cosmos that explains the visible rotation of the stars. When the spherical model of the Earth was proposed, early Greek cosmology as a whole began to be replaced, although this was not immediate. Geographers like Ctesias and Ephorus rejected a spherical Earth in the 4th century BC. Among authors from the early Roman Empire, Strabo, Tacitus, and the Epicureans continued to accept a flat Earth. The last Greek author known to maintain this position was Cosmas Indicopleustes in the 6th century AD.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAll models of early Greek cosmology shared the following five elements:\n\nA solid sky (firmament)\nHigh ridges at the rim of the (flat) earth\nThe sun being close to the earth when it sets and rises\nThe sun feeds on favors from the earth\nThe sun and moon are both small compared to the earth\nAnother important element of early Greek cosmology that would distinguish it from the ancient Greek astronomy that would come to dominate in later centuries was the emphasis on the role of the gods in the past and ongoing history of man and the mythological nature of the surrounding world.\n\n\n== Earth, Oceanus, and Hades ==\n\nNear the edges of the earth is a region inhabited by fantastical creatures, monsters, and quasi-human beings. Once one reaches the ends of the earth they find it to be surrounded by and delimited by an ocean (Oceanus), as is seen in the Babylonian Map of the World, although there is one main difference between the Babylonian and early Greek view: Oceanus is a river and so has an outer bank, whereas the Babylonian Map does not have an outer rung beyond which the world geography extends. But for Hesiod, beyond Oceanus lies both Hesperides, the daughter of Night (Nyx), and the Gorgons. The only human or hero to traverse past Oceanus is Heracles on his journey where he finds the cattle of Eurytion. The sun does not illuminate the region beyond the river ocean as its circular revolution does not extend over these regions. Instead, according to Mimnermus, it lies during the night in a golden chamber by the banks of the ocean, or perhaps in a barque that had been made by Hephaistos. Oceanus is also overlaid by the rim of a shield that was fashioned by Hephaistos for Achilles. Related to Oceanus, as his sister and wife, is Tethys, who was associated with freshwater, rivers, and springs. Beyond the ocean is the realm of Hades: as such, the ocean separates the domains of the living and the dead. This spatial separation is conceived on a horizontal plain and not a vertical one, and it is reflected by the journey of Odysseus to the afterworld (in this system, the afterworld/Hades is distinct from the underworld/Tartarus). Odysseus crosses the river ocean, takes a long walk across the banks of the ocean, and then arrives at the place where the rivers Kokytos and Pyriflegethon join to form the Acheron. Hades is also spatially characterized by terms like erebos and zophos which designate a region of darkness unreached by the sun. Finally, the center of the Earth, the axis mundi, often is said to have a cosmic mountain or cosmic tree, similar to Mount Mashu in Mesopotamian cosmology. In Homer's Iliad, Mount Olympus reaches to heaven.\nThe island of Circe is a kind of gate that regulates passage into Hades, which one must go through if they wish to enter Hades from the inhabited region or return to the inhabited region from Hades. The island, which is called \"the dwelling of early Dawn and her dancing-lawns, and the risings of the sun\" at the beginning of Book 12 of the Odyssey, is close to both the places where the sun rises and sun sets. This leads to the description of a counter-intuitive topography where both east and west ultimately collapse into a single point. This leads to Odysseus being disoriented on the island where he says \"we do not know where East is, nor where the bright sun goes down under the earth\": Odysseus cannot tell apart east from west. Like in Egyptian literature, the exit and entry point of the sun into the inhabited world, circumscribed by Oceanus, lie side by side with each other as a double-gate. Likewise in Hesiod's Theogony (lines 750–756), the paths of the sun and moon are contiguous.\n\n\n== Heaven ==\nThe heaven is a flat and solid firmament supported by pillars. Embedded into the firmament was the sun, moon, and the stars. These astral bodies were personified as, themselves, being gods that could be worshiped or prayed to. According to the Theogony of Hesiod, 116–133:First of all Chaos came into being, and then broad-bosomed Earth (Gaia), a firm seat of all things for ever, and misty Tartaros, deep down in broadpathed earth, and Eros, the most beautiful among the immortal gods, he who loosens our limbs, and subdues the mind and thoughtful counsel of all gods and men. From Chaos, Erebos and black Night came into being, and from Night, again, came Aither and Day, whom she conceived and bore after having mingled in love with Erebos. Now Earth first of all brought forth starry Ouranos, equal to herself, so that it would cover her on all sides, to be a firm seat for the blessed gods forever. She also brought forth large mountains, the beautiful abode of the divine Nymphs who dwell in the woody mountains. She also bore the unharvested sea, seething with its swell, Pontos, without an act of delightful love. Then she slept with Ouranos and bore Okeanos with his deep eddies [...]Heaven is described once as bronze and twice as iron. One passage in the Iliad, where Zeus makes a cosmic threat against any god who dares to intervene in the Trojan War, provides more information on how heaven relates to the rest of the universe:I will seize him and hurl him down to Tartaros wrapped in mist, \nfar away, a place where there is a pit deeper than any other, \nwhere there are iron gates and a bronze threshold, \n\nas far from Hades as heaven is from earth.Zeus makes a cosmic threat that any such actor will be hurled downwards at an immense distance, whose distance downwards is similar to the distance upwards to the heavens. Later, lines 721–725 reiterate that the region is as far below earth as earth is from heaven: just as it takes ten days for an anvil to fall from heaven to earth, so it takes ten to fall from earth to the underworld. This suggests that the Greeks in this period conceived of the cosmos on a vertical axis, where planes of the cosmos from Tartarus, the earth, and heaven are successively located above each other. Furthermore, the equivalence between the immensity of the directions up and down may also indicate that humans lie on the central plane of this vertical axis.\n\n\n== Underworld (Tartarus) ==\n\nThe underworld in the writings of Hesiod is an immense, dark, and enclosed region called \"Tartarus\". Tartarus is not a part of the underworld but rather its whole. Three different images of Tartarus can also be painted, depending on the observer. The Titans, sealed into Tartarus by Zeus during the Titanomachy, view it as an inescapable walled enclosure. The entities of Night, Day, Sleep, and Death effectively experience it as a house: it can be entered into and left at will. (These entities all reside in Tartarus, and so Tartarus can be said to house the cyclical phenomena of night, day, sleep, and death.) Finally, from the viewpoint of human topography, it can be understood as a great gorge. These images are also not mutually exclusive: the Titans have an increased difficulty of escaping from Tartarus, such as to the earth, due to the depth of the gorge. Hesiod offers multiple descriptions of features of the underworld, and sometimes they come into tension with each other. According to Johnson, the proper way to read Hesiod so as to avoid encountering such tensions, according to Hesiod's own intentions, is to understand that \"Hesiod is not attempting to provide a map of the various structures within the underworld but is giving separate descriptions of the underworld as a whole\".\nHesiod refers to a fence enclosing Tartarus, as well as Poseidon's doors and an associated wall; Johnson believes that these terms are referring to the same barrier. Tartarus is a great windy chasm. Some passages locate Atlas in Tartarus but others place it in the far west with the Hesperides, past Oceanus. Other evidence also indicates that Tartarus is both located below the earth but is also to be found at its edges. Thus, Tartarus extends such that some regions of it can be found vertically below the earth whereas others can be found horizontally surrounding it. Hesiod also places in Tartarus a house of Sleep and Death. Finally, the river and goddess Styx, who is the offspring of Oceanus and Tethys, flows into the underworld. The direct source for the water of the Styx river is Oceanus: once Styx parts from Oceanus, Styx flows into much of the underworld in both horizontal and vertical directions. Styx may be visualized as a singular stream starting at the horizon and then parting into multiple individual streams downwards.\n\n\n== Relationship to Cosmogony ==\nCosmography is related to cosmogony, the original formation of the cosmos, insofar as the latter provides an etiology for the former. Chaos has always existed and is the primordial matter, and out of it creation arises. Cosmic guardians ensure that the creation does not slip back into a status of chaos, for example: \"Sun will not overstep his measures; otherwise the Erinyes, guardians of Dike, will fnd him out.\" Chaos gives rise to Ouranos, Gaia, and Pontos (heaven, earth, sea) who, by association or sexual union, bring forth the rest of the gods. Cosmic struggles between Zeus and the Titans threaten the order of the universe in what is called the Titanomachy: Zeus and the Hundred-Armed eventually drives the Titans, previously Earth-bound, into the netherworld, Tartarus. A wall and fence is also built around Tartarus with giant bronze doors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJewish cosmology\nZoroastrian cosmology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAlgra, Keimpe (1999). \"The beginnings of cosmology\".

In the fifth round, United travelled to the City Ground and defeated Nottingham Forest 1–0.\nIn the quarter-finals, United defeated rivals Liverpool 4–3 after extra time at their home ground, Old Trafford.\nIn the semi-final match, also held at Wembley, United defeated Coventry City 4–2 on penalties after a 3–3 draw, during which they squandered a 3–0 lead, to set up a Manchester derby final for a second successive season. Coventry's Victor Torp put the ball in the back of the net at the very last minute which nearly completed a remarkable comeback and would have made them the first team from outside the top flight to reach an FA Cup final since Cardiff City in 2008, but Haji Wright, who assisted the goal, was allegedly caught offside in the buildup and it was ruled out by VAR. This will be the first time United will have played in successive FA Cup finals since 2005.\n\n\n== Match ==\nThe FA confirmed that the 2024 final would begin at 15:00, as the previous FA Cup final did.\n\nMatch rules\n\n90 minutes\n30 minutes of extra time if necessary\nPenalty shoot-out if scores still level\nNine named substitutes\nMaximum of five substitutions, with a sixth allowed in extra time\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marvin Ramalepe was a South African record producer and DJ. He gained fame for co-producing DJ Mujava's, \"Township Funk\" as well as his pioneering work in bacardi house.\n\n\n== Eary life ==\nSpoko was born and raised in Tzaneen, Limpopo before relocating to Atteridgeville situated west of Pretoria. Himself and his brother made the move to Atteridgeville in search of their father.\nAs a child, DJ Spoko earned the nickname \"Ghost\" while residing in Ghost Town, the neighborhood which was home to the Atteridgeville cemetery. Thus, Spoko was meant to be interpreted as “spook”. \nAt the age of 12, Spoko began producing songs in his home utilizing pirated drum-loop software. \n\nI just banged those drums. Hard! No bass, just drums - bang... I hate soft music, I just love noise.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his move to Atteridgeville, he embarked on his musical career and initiated his studies in sound engineering under the tutelage of Nozinja, the innovator of Shangaan electro.\nIn 2008, he garnered critical acclaim for co-producing Mujava's \"Township Funk\" which was released on Warp. The song marked an unforeseen crossover, blending elements of kwaito with bacardi house. It was featured on BBC Radio 1 show Worldwide in July 2008, and it became a favorite on DJ Pete Tong’s Essential Selection. David Guetta included the song in one of his F*** Me I'm Famous mix sets. Additionally, it became one of the most frequently played tracks in Fabric’s mix series.\n\nA little over 10 years ago now, an obscure song from Pretoria, South Africa flipped dancefloors across the Northern Hemisphere on their ears. It was called “Township Funk,” and if you know it, you are probably hearing it in your head right now. The hook is like no other: a giddy, two-note riff that abruptly goes zig-zagging across the spectrum, with greased-up synths glowing fluorescent over snapping snares. The kind of tune that stops listeners in their tracks, “Township Funk” is not just an earworm but an earworm that has grown feet, learned to juggle, and taken up bungee jumping.\nIn 2010, DJ Spoko and  Mujava released, \"Mugwanti\".\nIn 2014, DJ Spoko, Spoek Mathambo, guitarist Andre Geldenhuys, drummer Michael Buchanan and Bhekisenzo Cele came together to form a collective known as Fantasma. Drawing from a diverse array of influences Fantasma combined maskandi, Shangaan electro, hip-hop, punk rock, electronica,psychedelic rock and other genres. \nSpoko performed at Okayafrica Presents: Black Coffee, DJ Spoko and Electrafrique on the SummerStage in, Central Park.\nIn 2015, Spoko performed at Nozinja's headline show during the Red Bull Music Academy festival's, Electronic Africa in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\nDJ Spoko made his debut in hip-hop by releasing the EP Falling Se'sfikile under the alias SycoKillah. Spoko referred to the genre of music as, \"kasi rap\".\nIn 2016, DJ Mujava and Spoko made a comeback making their return to music after years, with their first new release, releasing the bacardi house, I.M.I. (Intelligent Mental Institution) extended play on August 12, 2016, through True Panther Sounds.\n\n\n== Bacardi house ==\nIn the 2000s, DJ Spoko, DJ Mujava, House Station, Mzo Bullet and several others pioneered bacardi house, popularly referred to as \"sgubhu saPitori\" featuring tracks such as \"Township Funk\", \"Tobetsa\", \"Casablanca\" and \"Mugwanti\". Bacardi house is a subgenre of kwaito and house music that blends percussive elements with pop-synth melodies. Bacardi house was described as \"a fusion of martial military-style snares, wobbly, disorientated synth sounds and gruff call-and-response vocals\" by Dean Bein of Dazed. \n\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn October 2015, news reports surfaced that DJ Spoko fell ill during his European tour. Subsequently, he underwent treatment for tuberculosis at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland.\nSpoko passed away on March 14, 2018. Cause of death, unknown.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nDJ Spoko's fascination with music ignited during his time in Soweto. Upon hearing about Shangaanis experimenting with electronic sounds he delved into their world. Spending three years immersed in studying musical styles, audio engineering and production he honed his skills. Beyond pioneering the bacardi house movement Spoko ventured into hip hop, rap, house variants and electronic dance music. Moreover, Spoko embraced fusion music with Fantasma, the musical collective he was a member of.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGhost Town (2013)\nWAR GOD (2014)\nSpecial Edition (2015)\nFalling Se'sfikile\nI.M.I (2016)\nDirty Dancing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDj Spoko's documentary, trailer - (2016, TheTownship king, OkayAfrica TV, Ghetto Boyz Empire)\nSpoko & Mujava Boiler Room South Africa DJ Set - (2016, Boiler Room)",

        "content": "The Vaucanson Automat Flute Player is an android automaton playing the transverse flute, designed and produced by Jacques de Vaucanson and presented to the public in 1738. It faithfully recreates the playing of a flautist on an instrument identical to those in use at the time.\n\n\n== The automaton ==\nThe idea of an automated flutist came to Vaucanson while he was observing the statue of the Faun playing the flute, also known as the Shepherd Flutist, by Antoine Coysevox in the Tuileries Garden.\nBegun in 1735, the automaton was completed in October 1737. After a brief exhibition at the Foire Saint-Germain, it was put on a paid demonstration in January 1738 at the Hôtel de Longueville, where Vaucanson had his workshop. The public is divided between skepticism and admiration, and Voltaire describes the inventor as \"rival of Prometheus\". At first reluctant, but at the express request of Louis XV transmitted by his prime minister, Cardinal de Fleury, the members of the French Academy of Sciences went to the Hôtel de Longueville to examine the automaton. Vaucanson made a detailed presentation to them in his memoir of April 30, 1738, and the Academy returned a laudatory report signed by the perpetual secretary Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle, with approval for printing by Henri Pitot:\n\nThe Academy, having heard the reading of a Memoir by Mr. Vaucanson containing the description of a wooden statue, copied from Coysevox's marble faun, playing the transverse flute, upon which it performs twelve different tunes with a precision that has deserved the attention of the public, and of which a large part of the Academy has been witness, judged that this machine was extremely ingenious, that the author must have employed simple and new means, both to give the fingers of this figure the necessary movements and to modify the air entering the flute, by increasing or decreasing the speed according to the different tones, by varying the arrangement of the lips, and by moving a valve that performs the function of the tongue; finally, by imitating through art everything that man is obliged to do, and that furthermore, Mr. Vaucanson's Memoir had all the clarity and precision that this machine is capable of, which proves the intelligence of the author and his great knowledge in the various parts of mechanics.\nTo illustrate his article “Android», the Encyclopédie gives an extremely detailed description in 1751, largely taken from the memoir of 1738. The flutist, approximately 1.60 metres (63 in) high, resting on a 1.45 metres (57 in) pedestal hiding the mechanism, was a slightly reduced imitation of the Coysevox faun, dressed in savage clothing.\nFrom 1741, the Fluter was exhibited in several cities in France and in Italy with two other creations by Vaucanson, the Digesting Duck and the Provençal Tambourinaire.\nRented for a year to three Lyon merchants, including a certain Pierre Dumoulin, master glover-perfumer, the automatons were exhibited in London in 1742, then purchased in Vaucanson at the end of the lease. Dumoulin made them travel to the Netherlands, France, notably Strasbourg in 1746, and Germany, where, due to lack of money, their journey was interrupted in 1755 at a pawnbroker in Nuremberg. As a precaution, Dumoulin made the automatons unusable, reversing parts of the Flutor and the Tambourinaire. Having left for Russia, he died there without ever coming to reclaim his property.\nAfter thirty years of abandonment in Nuremberg, the automatons passed into the hands of several owners and repair mechanics, but it seems that, unlike the Duck, the Flutor and the Drummer never worked again. Gottfried Christoph Beireis, professor of medicine in Helmstedt and collector of curiosities, after purchasing the automata in 1784, called on Johann Georg Bischoff Jr. to restore them, and declared himself satisfied with the result; nevertheless, to modernize the flautist's repertoire, he had the cylinder replaced with a mechanical musical instrument performing one of his favorite tunes, taken from Carl Heinrich Graun's opera Brittanico, which he had previously heard on a musical clock. Abusing the credulity of the rich collector, a charlatan promises to improve the fluter by integrating a device that would allow him to play on sight any sheet that is presented to him, then he disappears without leaving an address; his intervention would have put an end to any possibility of further restoration. Goethe, who visited Beireis in 1805, wrote in his Tag- und Jahreshefte: \"Der Flötenspieler war verstummt\" (the flautist had become mute). Around 1840, automatons, including the famous Duck, were entrusted for repair to Johann Bartholomé Rechsteiner, but nothing indicates that he succeeded in putting the flute back in working order, if indeed he really had this automaton in his hands.\nThe last recorded exhibition of the Flûteur was that of September 1863 in Paris, organized by the automaton Blaise Bontems, which however remains uncertain. We don't know what happened to him afterwards; at the end of the 19th century, it would have been present in Vienna, mentioned then as the only authentic Vaucanson automaton still surviving.\n\n\n=== The flute and sound production ===\nRemovable and replaceable, the flute was in all likelihood, and unlike the galoubet of the Provençal Tambourinaire, the only part not built by Vaucanson and his watchmaking workers. The memoir of 1738 and the article Android of the Encyclopedia indicate that this flute is in D, that it requires the active role of three fingers of the left hand and four of the right hand, and, as is seen on the engravings of the Carnavalet museum and the National Library, it was in four parts.\n\n\n== References ==",

His pen name was Shoko Kadomatsu (門松暁鐘).\n\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born in Yanagawa, Fukuoka Prefecture. His birthplace was Asa District, Yamaguchi Prefecture (present-day Sanyo-Onoda). In 1946, when he was in the first year of junior high school, he joined the Democratic Youth League of Japan. In April 1949, he joined the Japanese Communist Party at the same time as he entered high school. When the Cominform criticized the JCP in 1950, he belonged to the Internationalists, and after the dissolution of the Internationalists' \"National Unification Conference\" in 1951, he did not return to the party and was active in the Zengakuren.\nAfter being expelled from Fukuoka Prefectural Densikan High School, he passed the university entrance exam and obtained the qualification to enter university. He entered Tokyo Gakugei University but dropped out and re-entered the Department of Philosophy at University of Tokyo. Initially, he was strongly interested in Ernst Mach, but on the recommendation of his supervisor, he decided to concentrate on the study of Kant. He then went on to graduate school at the University of Tokyo. In 1965, he completed the course requirements for the doctoral program and left the university.\nIn July 1955, he rejoined the party following the Sixth National Conference of the Japanese Communist Party, but left the party the following year after his co-authored book The Student Movement in Japan (日本の学生運動), was criticized. In December 1958, when the Communist League, which was hostile to the JCP, was formed, he continued to support it by writing theory. It is said that the journal Situation (情況), first published in 1967, was founded with 1 million yen in aid from Hiromatsu, according to its founder Susumu Koga. In 1990, when socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were collapsing, he was also involved in the launch of a civic organization, Forum 90s (フォーラム90s).\nFrom 1965 to 1970, he taught German language and philosophy at Nagoya Institute of Technology and Nagoya University. He joined Nagoya Institute of Technologyin 1965, became an associate professor in 1966, a lecturer at Nagoya University in 1967, and an associate professor in 1969. In 1970, he resigned from Nagoya University in support of the student movement. He was also a lecturer at Hosei University and a professor at the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo. He retired from the University of Tokyo in March 1994. He died of lung cancer on May 22, 1994.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\nHiromatsu's thought is based on Marxism and attempts to break away from modernity.\n\n\n=== Reification ===\nHiromatsu argued for a shift from the Marx's theory of alienation to \"reification theory\" (物象化論), criticizing the former's reliance on the \"subject-object\" dichotomy. He claimed the \"subject-object\" dichotomy is a modern construct, and behind the construct lies in the \"primacy of relations\" (関係の一次性). While alienation theory posits that a subject, through labor, imbues a product with \"value\" and consequently becomes alienated from it, Hiromatsu challenges this understanding of \"value.\"\nFrom the perspective of reification theory, Hiromatsu argues that the determinant of \"value\" lies in the \"social relations of producers to total labor.\" It is not the act of an individual's labor but rather the \"total labor\" (総労働) of individuals intertwined in a network of relations that paradoxically determines the \"value\" of individual labor. Thus, the value produced by an individual's labor is not directly attached to the product. Instead, the value of individual labor is assigned retroactively from the total labor, creating the illusion that a specific subject has imbued the product with value. Marx referred to this phenomenon as a \"quid pro quo\" and identified it as commodity fetishism.\n\n\n=== Co-Subjective Existential Structure of the World ===\nExpanding upon reification theory, Hiromatsu developed his unique concept of the \"co-subjective existential structure of the world\" (世界の共同主観的存在構造). He argued that the modern \"subject - object\" schema leads to a problematic 3-fold schema of \"act of consciousness - content of consciousness - object itself\", which has been invalidated scientifically by Gestalt psychology.\nInstead, Hiromatsu proposes the \"objective two factors and subjective duality\" (対象的二要因と主体的二重性) of phenomena. He argues that the phenomenal world we perceive inherently possesses a \"four-limbed structural relation\" (四肢的構造連関) where these  overlap:\n\nRegarding phenomenal objects, Hiromatsu states that they \"appear immediately, each time anew, as something more than mere sensory data.\" For example, when we see a pencil, we recognize it as a pencil. Objects are always cognized within the structure of \"as something\". This structure implies that the ideal \"Something\" (in this case, a pencil) is \"incarnated\" in the real given. Hiromatsu does not view the real and the ideal as mutually exclusive opposites; rather, he believes that the real and ideal are structurally unified in a dyadic manner within the object.\nRegarding the subject, Hiromatsu argues that phenomena can exist not only for me but also for others, and the phenomena vary by the subject. For example, when hearing the sound of a clock, a Japanese speaker might hear \"kachi kachi,\" while an English speaker might hear \"tick tock.\" In other words, the way the given \"Something\" is conscious is co-subjectivized by the community. Therefore, Hiromatsu believes that the subject to whom the object opens \"towards\" is not simply me as an individual but rather \"me as we.\" He argues that the subject to whom the phenomenal world opens \"towards\" possesses a dyadic duality of \"the who as someone\" (誰かとしての誰).\nCombining these respective dyadic qualities, Hiromatsu describes the tetradic structural relation as the mode of existence of the world where \"the 'given', as something more, is true to a 'someone as someone' (Gegebenes als etwas Mehr gilt einem als jemandem)\", that is, the world we experience is not simply an objective reality \"out there\" but is co-created with the given sensory data, our active interpretation, and our social and cultural context.\n\n\n=== Overcoming Modernity ===\nHiromatsu discusses the concept of \"overcoming modernity\" (近代の超克) as a summary of wartime thought. He specifically assesses the Kyoto School's theory of overcoming modernity from a Marxist perspective, noting that it addressed \"human alienation\" (人間疎外) and aimed to overcome this \"alienated\" historical situation. The Kyoto School's philosophical anthropology attempted to grasp human existence relatively, considering the \"reality of life\" (生の現実) and including \"emotional aspects\" (情意的な面) in contrast to the Enlightenment view of humans as merely \"rational beings.\" Hiromatsu criticizes the Kyoto School for remaining within the framework of modernity. He points out that philosophical anthropology is rooted in humanism, which corresponds to the horizon of modernity, often referred to as the \"age of anthropocentrism\" (人間中心主義の時代). Consequently, he argues that it is merely a form of typical modern philosophy and ideology.\n\n\n=== Marxism ===\nHiromatsu's political thought was heavily influenced by his mother, a member of the JCP. He developed a philosophy, engaging with Marx and Engels's theory of reification, as well as the ideas of Mach, Husserl, and Heidegger, in an attempt to overcome the subject-object dichotomy.\nRegarding The German Ideology, which Marx and Engels left as a draft and was later edited and published, the edition by Vladimir Adoratsky, by the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in 1932. Hiromatsu pointed out the problems with this edition. He subsequently published his independently edited New Edition of The German Ideology and other monographs. In The German Ideology, he developed his own view that Marx's thought underwent a shift from the alienation theory of his earlier Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 to the reification theory of his later period. At the time, many interpreted Marx and Engels's thought with alienation theory as the central axis, so Hiromatsu's interpretation, which attempted to understand Marx based on the later reification theory, caused controversy. He published his Marxist trilogy, The Formation of Marxism, The Horizon of Marxism, and The Logic of Marxism, (マルクス主義の成立過程, マルクス主義の地平, マルクス主義の理路) between the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMurthy, Viren (July 2023). \"Rethinking materialism and Asia: Miki Kiyoshi and Hiromatsu Wataru\".

These would then also include the best youth teams of the professional clubs from the Super League and the Challenge League. The Swiss youth U-20 championship was to be despanded, these teams would then be called U-21 and would be eligible to play in the third tier or fourth tier. The four top teams in this last U-20 championship would advance to the new 1. Liga. This all meant that the number of relegations this season was increased to twelve.\nIn the 1999–2000 season, the 1. Liga clubs were divided into four regional groups, each with 14 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their league position. The four group winners and the four runners-up then contested a play-off for the two promotion slots. The three last placed teams in each group were directly relegated to the newly named 2. Liga Interregional (fourth tier).\n\n\n== Group 1 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n=== Decider ===\nDue the fact that the club FC Bex had infrastructural deficiencies, they were not eligible to enter the play-offs for promotion to the Nationalliga B, this right was passed down to the third placed club in the division. Because the teams from Naters and Meyrin ended the season level on points they had to play a league positions decider. The match was played on a neutral ground and it took place on May 24, 2000, in Martigny.\n\n  Meyrin win the decider and advance to play-offs.\n\n\n== Group 2 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 3 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Group 4 ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Final league table ===\n\n\n== Promotion play-off ==\nFrom group 1 the group champions Chênois and decider match winners Meyrin, from group 2 the group winners Wangen b.O. and runners-up Wohlen, from group 3 champions Locarno and runners up Zug 94 played together with group 4 winners Vaduz and runners-up Red Star played in the qualification round of the play-offs. The winners here would advance to the finals. The two final winners would be promoted to the Nationalliga B.\n\n\n=== Qualification round ===\n   Wangen b.O. win 5–2 on aggregate and continue to the finals.\n  Locarno win 4–1 on aggregate and continue to the finals.\n  4–4 on aggregate, Zug 94 win on away goals and continue to the finals.\n  2–2 on aggregate, Wohlen win on away goals and continue to the finals.\n\n\n=== Final round ===\n  Locarno win 6–4 on aggregate and are promoted to Nationalliga B.\n  Wangen b.O. win 3–2 on aggregate and are promoted to Nationalliga B.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nGroup 1, group winners were Chênois, group 2 winners were Wangen b.O., group 3 winners were Locarno and group 4 winners were Vaduz. In the promotion play-offs Locarno and Wangen b.O. achieved promotion. Relegated were, from group 1: Renes, Visp and Signal, from group 2: Bümpliz, Stade Payerne and Lyss and from group 3: Küsnacht, Ascona and Cham. Finally from group 4: Wülflingen, Frauenfeld and Eschen/Mauren also suffered relegation.\nThe remaining teams in the division would be joined by Stade Nyonnais and FC Schaffhausen who suffered relegation from the Nationalliga B this season. They would also be joined by the four youth teams Servette U-21, Grasshopper Club U-21, St. Gallen U-21 and Lausanne-Sport U-21.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1999–2000 Nationalliga A\n1999–2000 Swiss Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSwitzerland 1999–2000 at RSSSF\nSeason 1999–2000 at the official website",

        "content": "Burhan Šaban (born October 8, 1970) is a Bosnian singer of Islamic divine and spiritual songs, nasheeds, and qasida.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nŠaban was born on October 8, 1970, in Skopje, SFR Yugoslavia. By the age of 14, he became a hafiz (someone who has completely memorized the Quran). This achievement earned him the nickname \"Little Hafiz\" (Mali hafiz) when he moved to Sarajevo at the age of 15. In 1987, he became the soloist in the choir of Gazi Husrev Bey's Madrasa, where he performed traditional Turkish ilahis. Subsequently, he began interpreting these chants independently.\nThe first albums of ilahi and qasida released in Bosnia and Herzegovina venues are recognizable by Burhan's solo interpretations. He published his first solo album with hymns in Turkish in 1990.\nIn 1991, he enrolled in Oriental Studies at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo.\nIn 1993, Šaban collaborated with friends in Zagreb to release a war album featuring his interpretation of Latić's text \"Puhnuće behar\". This album was significantly  influenced by the authorship of Zele Lipovača.\nDuring the Bosnian War, Šaban moved to Turkey. Utilizing his native Turkish fluency and his understanding of both Bosnian and the conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he worked in Turkish media, informing the public about the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHe attained a prominent position in the foreign policy newsroom of TGRT television, primarily due to his multilingual proficiency. Šaban was also active in the music department, where he recorded three solo albums spanning various musical genres: ilahia, art music, and arabesque.\nIn 1996, he participated in the project led by Yusuf Islam I Have No Cannons That Roar, which was published in London.\nAfter the release of the album Ja sam vjetar zaljubljeni, concerts that followed were Dođi najdraži, San o Bosni, Pogledaj nas ja Rabbi, Poruka, Mošus Pejgamberov, that were well received by the public.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nŠaban is married to Šejma Pašanović. In the fall of 2008, they had a daughter named Iman. He resides mainly in Sarajevo and works on a regular route between Sarajevo, Skopje, Istanbul, and Copenhagen.

        "content": "Angel Medical Center is a hospital located in Franklin, North Carolina certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The hospital is licensed for 30 beds, plus a 17-bed emergency department.\nIt is affiliated with Mission Health System, based in Asheville, N.C., and HCA Healthcare based in Nashville, Tennessee. The average inpatient stays three days at Angel.\n\n\n== History ==\nFranklin's first hospital opened on August 1, 1923, with four beds on the second floor of a small house on Palmer Street known as the Cunningham Building. It was opened by Dr. Furman Angel, a Macon County native who graduated from Franklin High School in 1913. In 1924, Dr. Angel bought the Cope Elias property and renovated Dr. W.A. Rogers' home to serve as a new hospital.\nIn June 1926, Dr. Angel opened the first permanent hospital in North Carolina west of Asheville. The 30-bed facility cost $25,000 to build. A 20-bed annex was added in 1927, making the hospital three stories high. Dr. Angel founded the first training school for nurses in western North Carolina to meet demand for the hospital. The Rogers home served as a residence for nurses until it was destroyed by fire a few years later.\nIn 1932, Furman's younger brother Edgar, who was also a doctor, joined the staff and the facility was renamed Angel Brothers Hospital. In 1940, Edgar Angel purchased the facility from his brother. The name was shortened to Angel Hospital and it began operating as a non-profit.\n\nIn 1957, a new $300,000 outpatient wing was built. In 1966, following the brothers' deaths, the hospital was sold to the community for $1 million. A $6 million addition to the hospital opened in 1974. The addition included the 24-bed Amelia Bauer-Kahn Psychiatric Unit, and brought the hospital to a total of 59 inpatient beds, or 84 overall.\nA two-story intensive care unit and surgical suite was built behind the hospital in 1991. In 1996, the hospital's front was renovated to make more space for its laboratory, cafeteria, business office, records, and administration. Two years later more space was added to the back of the facility for same-day surgery and outpatient medicine. In 2002, the radiology department emergency department moved to a new addition and the radiology department took the space it formerly occupied.\n\n\n=== Big healthcare and new campus ===\n\nMission Health System of Asheville began a management agreement with Angel Medical Center in May 2011. In 2016, Angel Medical Center announced a $4.3 million expansion of the labor and delivery unit to accommodate more births. In April 2017, however, the hospital announced that labor and delivery services would be discontinued at the hospital after 61 years. The following month Mission Health announced plans to entirely replace Angel Medical Center with a new campus built outside of downtown. It was then announced that Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA Healthcare had acquired Mission Health, and Angel Medical Center as a result. Since the medical center was acquired by healthcare giants, community members have expressed concern over decreasing services, excessive billing, and costly transfers. By 2024, HCA was facing lawsuits from multiple western North Carolina governments regarding alleged monopolistic practices.\nThe newly built, $70 million Angel Medical Center campus opened on the east side of Franklin on September 18, 2022. The complex includes three operating rooms and a 17-bed emergency department with two trauma bays. Despite the hospital decreasing in size from around 180,000 square feet to 82,500 square feet, the new campus offers five more inpatient rooms than the former campus did at the end of its lifespan. The 30 new inpatient rooms are also about twice as large as rooms at the former campus. Operating rooms have doubled in size as well.\nIn 2022, the Town of Franklin considered converting Angel Medical Center's former 16-acre downtown campus into senior residential living. In March 2024, Angel Medical Center CEO Clint Kendall said the old buildings will likely be demolished due to the facility's age and cost.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dolors Martí Domènech (1901–1970) was the only woman to have a public career and to hold a position of political responsibility with the Catalan Republican government in Tarragona, Spain in the 1930s. She died in exile in France in 1970.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDolors Martí Domènech was born in Tivissa in the Province de Tarragona, Spain in 1901, the daughter of Juliana Domènech Tost and Jaume Martí Jardí, a farmer. She was the youngest of ten siblings, six of whom died of diphtheria in childhood.\nHer father was a member of the Tivissa Republican Committee, led by Marcelino Domingo, a politician from Tortosa. Dolors' father was a great influence on her, and by the age of 13 she was accompanying him to political meetings. She showed an early talent for writing poetry (in both Catalan and Spanish) as well as political speeches and proclamations.\nAt the age of twenty, shortly after her father's death, she began working in a blinds factory near Tivissa, and later moved to Barcelona. She married teacher Adrià Broseta Merecenciano, of Valencia, and they moved around for his job, living in Cornellà de Llobregat, Vila-seca, Salomó, Renau and Tarragone). The couple had two children, Ferran and Maria Lluïsa Broseta Martí.\n\n\n== The Second Spanish Republic ==\nThe proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic took place while the Broseta Martí family was living in Reus. Shortly afterwards, they moved to Vila-seca, where Dolors Martí Domènech joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, successfully taking part as a speaker in the 1933 general election.\nWhen her husband was transferred to Salomó, Dolors Martí Domènech set up the Women's Group of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Agrupació Femenina del Partit Socialista Obrer Espanyol, PSOE) and developed significant trade union activity within the Unión General de Trabajadores (General Workers Union, UGT), which led to conflict and confrontations with the locals.\nShortly after the events of 6 October 1934, her husband was transferred to Renau, Tarragona, a village with a population of 82 people, and advised Martí Domènech to stay away from political conflicts and to go to Barcelona to train as a midwife instead.\nMartí Domènech began the preparatory courses for this training, but didn't continue with it as she wanted to fulfil her responsibilities as a mother and wife alongside her political interests. The parliamentary elections of 16 February 1936 resulted in a victory for the left-wing parties and the Spanish Popular Front, which led her to redouble her political passions.\n\n\n== The Spanish Civil War ==\nThe Spanish Civil War broke out in mid July 1936 by which time Martí Domènech had rejoined her husband. In Renau, she intervened when a Republican militia arrived to clear the village of suspected Nationalist faction supporters. Due to her intervention, no one was killed and the church was not burnt down, which did happen elsewhere. On 15 August 1936, her husband decided to take their family to Llíria in Province of Valencia, but at the end of September, Martí Domènech returned to Tarragona with her children, as she wanted to be more than a spectator to political events. She contacted David Valle Peña and Josep Catalán, leaders of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) and the General Workers Union (UGT), who recruited her as a speaker in the campaigns for the Republic. Her husband soon returned to teach in Tarragona.\nDuring the May Days protests in 1937, Martí Domènech was secretary of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC). She protested against the shootings which took place on the La Rambla street in Barcelona, and helped to look after the wounded at the General Workers Union headquarters.\nOn 4 November 1937, Dolors Martí Domènech was nominated as a Delegate to the government's Departament d'Economia de la Regió III de Tarragona, which covered the areas of Alt Camp, Alt Penedès, Baix Penedès, Garraf et Tarragonès, with a population of almost 175,000 inhabitants. During the months she held this post, she had to deal with major problems arising from the bombings of towns and cities which were a regular occurrence during the Spanish Civil War. She grappled with the supply problems caused by the scarcity of raw materials and the destruction of factories due to the bombings. Part of her role involved helping to organise the supply chains within the collectivisation implemented by the Republicans in the early months of the Civil War.\n\n\n== Exile ==\nTwo days before the occupation of Tarragona by Franco's Nationalist faction army, the Broseta-Martí family went into exile. As soon as they arrived in France, her husband was taken to Argelès-sur-Mer and then to the Bram concentration camp, and Dolors Martí Domènech and her children were transferred to Méry-sur-Seine. They would not see each other again for a year.\nOnce reunited the family managed to get to Bordeaux, with the aim of embarking for Mexico, but the planned boat never arrived. They stayed in Bordeaux, where her husband found work at the Mérignac submarine base.\nDuring the German occupation of France, Dolors Martí Domènech managed to maintain contact with her Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia comrades. The French police arrested her for taking in a Communist who had escaped from a police station.\n\n\n== Post War ==\nAfter the end of the Second World War, she hoped to return to Catalonia to play a political role in her native country, mistakenly believing that Franco's  regime would not be supported by the Allies of World War II. However, her support of Spanish Communist politician, journalist and writer Joan Comorera, led to accusations of deviationism. She was disqualified from holding party office and finally expelled from the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia on 27 October 1946.\nShe returned to Spain only once, in 1968, on a trip to Reus to say goodbye to her dying sister.\nDolors Martí Domènech lived in Bordeaux until her death in 1970 at the age of 69.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nThe Historical Memory Law of 2007 finally granted officia recognition to the victims of the Francoist Spanish dictatorship. Years later, Tarragona City Council, committed to remembrance and gender equality, decided to name one of the city's streets after Dolors Martí Domènech and to consider the names of other emblematic women in the future.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Teófilo Hayashi (April 15, 1980), best known as Teo Hayashi, is a Brazilian pastor and missionary, son and grandson of pastors. Teo Hayashi founded the Dunamis Movement in 2008, after returning from the United States, where he lived. In 2016, he participated in the event \"The Call: Azusa Now\" in Los Angeles, which would give rise to the movement \"The Send\" in 2019, of which Hayashi was one of the co-founders.\nTeo Hayashi's mother, Sarah Hayashi, founded the Monte Sião Church in São Paulo, in 1977. His maternal grandparents, Hiroyuki Hayashi and Kaoru Hayashi, were missionaries and came from Japan to Brazil in 1935, with the aim of serving Japanese immigrants living in Amazonas.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTeo Hayashi finished secondary school in Brazil and went to the United States to study psychology at Liberty University. It was while graduating that, according to him, he began to \"deviate from the ways of the Lord.\" However, at the end of this period, God would have directed him to Youth With A Mission (YWAM), which he claims he had to research about, as he did not know what the organization was about. Teo Hayashi then spent three years on missions at the YWAM base in Hawaii, where he became convinced that his work should be aimed at college students, due to his own negative personal experience. He also served as a YWAM missionary in Asia, and upon returning to the United States, spent another five years working at Kingsley Fletcher Ministries.\nIn 2008, he abandoned his plans to remain in the United States and returned to Brazil, to serve as one of the pastors in his mother's church, Comunidade Monte Sião. In April of this same year, he founded the Dunamis Movement, with the aim of working on Gospel among young university students. It was during one of these meetings that he met his wife, Junia, with whom he had two children, Zack and Koa.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\nTeo Hayashi has a more conservative view of what the believer's role and attitudes should be in society. According to him, discussing his rejection of \"hypergrace\" (translated as attitudes alien to Christian conduct),\n\n(...) relativism deconstructs and confuses the bases of faith and brings about the normalization of things that have always been absurd.\nHayashi condemns behaviors such as \"consulting psychics, fortune tellers, astrology\" among other things prohibited by the Bible. It also includes \"listening to and dancing to music with immoral lyrics, using foul language, agreeing with abortion.\"\nStill according to his view, the lack of a clear line separating believers from non-believers, could give rise to the \"stoner Christian, the mugger Christian, the clubbing Christian, the polyamory Christian, the Christian who doesn't believe in Christ\" and the like.\n\n\n== The Send ==\nAfter his participation in \"The Call: Azusa Now\", in 2016, Teo Hayashi became one of the organizers of the \"The Send\" movement, preaching and mobilizing large masses of young people. Initially, the event was only held in the United States, but from 2020 onwards, it came to Brazil on the initiative of then minister Damares Alves. According to Hayashi, \"The Send\" is not a gospel entertainment proposal, but,\n\n(...) a mobilization that will push young evangelicals to commit to actions. Some will embrace their school or university as a mission field, some will consider adopting an orphan and others will dedicate their lives to being sent as missionaries to a nation that has not yet been reached by the Gospel.\nHayashi does not deny that \"The Send\" is more than a revival movement, and that it also has an undeniable political dimension:\n\n(...) in my way of seeing it, I believe that seeing the growth of the Evangelical Church in Brazil, seeing what the Church managed to do in favor of the transformation in Brazil's political scenario, and thinking that we are not in the revival... It's kind of like not wanting to look at what God has already started to do.\n\n\n== Zion Church ==\nIn January 2020, the Monte Sião Church where Teo Hayashi is pastor, underwent a rebranding and was renamed \"Zion Church\". The global aspirations of its leadership probably explain this name change, which is highlighted on its official page welcoming the new name:\n\nSince its foundation, the Monte Sião Church has had a calling that does not restrict this transformation to Brazil alone, but reaches out to nations and different cultures.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNuvem de glória (2016) - With Sarah Hayashi\nNext level (2017)\nO Reino inabalável (2018)\nUm Poder em Movimento: Uma história do fluir Dunamis tocando gerações (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Hniliczki affair, Hniliczki conversion or Hniliczki case was a political-religious scandal that took place in Galicia in the first months of 1882.\nIn late December 1881, 129 peasants, residents of the village of Hniliczki Małe, legally converted from Greek Catholicism to Orthodoxy. Their motive for making this decision was a dispute with their parson and the desire to establish a separate Greek Catholic parish. The leading Russophile activist, Father Ivan Naumovich, inspired them to change their religion, without fully realizing the consequences. However, the political nature of the conversion was quickly detected, and the decision to change religion was reversed.\nThe Hniliczki conversion prompted the Austrian authorities to take decisive action against the Russophile movement in general. According to researchers, Austrian politicians were concerned about the development of Russian pan-Slavism, and when relations between Austria and Russia deteriorated due to conflicting interests in the Balkans, they decided to use the entire affair as a pretext to suppress the movement advocating for Galicia's unification with Russia. Father Naumovich and a group of nine other Russophiles were accused of treason, espionage, and disturbing public order. These charges were clearly exaggerated and, according to historians, exceeded the defendants' real capabilities. Ultimately, probably due to pressure from the Russian diplomacy, the trial ended with low sentences imposed only for disturbing public order.\nThe Hniliczki Affair is considered a watershed event in the history of the debate over the cultural and national consciousness of Galician Ukrainians. The Hniliczki trial prompted leading Russophiles to emigrate to Russia, and the Vatican to replace the Greek Catholic Metropolitan of Lviv, Joseph Sembratovych, with a pro-Polish and pro-Latin Sylwester Sembratowicz.\n\n\n== Conversion of Hniliczki residents ==\n\n\n=== Circumstances of the event ===\nAccording to Włodzimierz Osadczy, the entire situation was the result of the involvement of Russophile activists in the conflict between the parson of the Greek Catholic parish in Hniliczki and the residents of the village of Hniliczki Małe. Since 1877, the Greek Catholic population living in this village had been requesting the establishment of a filial parish due to their insufficient number according to the Church regulations (800 people). The former parson in Hniliczki, Jan Herasimowicz (Harasimowicz), advised submitting a request on this matter to the county authorities and the consistory.\n\n\n=== Conversion ===\nAt the turn of 1881 and 1882, the Galician press reported that 129 inhabitants of the village of Hniliczki Małe in the Zbarazh district submitted a request to convert from Eastern Catholicism to Orthodoxy. The application addressed to the county administration was dated 25 December 1881, and was signed by 21 individuals. They declared a change of faith from Greek Catholicism to Orthodox on behalf of themselves and their underage children. A longer letter was sent to the Greek Catholic consistory, in which the same individuals accused the Pope of violating the provisions of the Union of Brest, imposing it by force, and destroying churches. Latin rite priests working in Galicia were also accused of having a negative attitude towards the Ruthenian population. Particularly negative statements were made against the Jesuits, likening them to Pharisees and wolves in sheep's clothing. The application ended with a declaration of loyalty to the Emperor of Austria. A separate letter was addressed to the parish priest of the Orthodox parish of St. George in Lviv.\nThe investigation conducted by the Greek Catholic consistory in Lviv showed that the residents of Hniliczki Małe were unaware of the consequences of the conversion. They did not understand the word \"Orthodoxy\" and believed that the applications they submitted were only about establishing a separate Greek Catholic parish in the village. They had never read the letter to the consistory, which was written by either Father Naumovich or his son Mykola. After a visit from a commission of the Greek Catholic consistory to Hniliczki Małe, they revoked the decision to change their faith. The commission was satisfied with this declaration and did not conduct a deeper investigation to find the inspirators of the conversion. They accepted the version that the transition to Orthodoxy was suggested to the peasants by a local landowner, Count Della Scala, whose mother belonged to that faith.\nThe change of faith itself was not a crime under Austro-Hungarian law. However, in the case of the Hniliczki conversion, the authorities concluded that the authors of the applications were not motivated by religious reasons but by political ones. They also found that the consistorial commission did not sufficiently investigate the circumstances of the case. It was acknowledged that the accusations against Catholicism in the application indicated that the text was not written by the peasants of Hniliczki but by a well-known Russophile activist, the parson of the Greek Catholic parish in Skalat, Ivan Naumovich. Further investigation allowed for the identification of the host Ivan Szpunder as the actual leader of the group of converts. Szpunder maintained close contacts with Father Naumovich and shared his political views. Another important figure in the case was Oleksa Załuski, also a Russophile and a friend of Father Naumovich, who was in conflict with the Hniliczki parson due to his repeated articulation of unequivocally anti-Orthodox views. Seeing the dissatisfaction of the inhabitants of Hniliczki Małe with the lack of a church in their village, Szpunder began to promote the idea of ​​adopting Orthodoxy, which was passed on to him by Father Naumovich. Ultimately, he convinced the residents of Hniliczki Małe when they learned about the plans to build a new Greek Catholic church in Hniliczki Wielkie; as parishioners, they would have to financially contribute to the investment. The clergyman himself, according to Włodzimierz Osadczy, wanted to show the consequences of the policies of the Austrian authorities, intervening in the religious life of the Galician Ruthenian population, and thus to force the authorities to choose: promoting the Latin rite or agreeing to the spread of Orthodoxy.\n\n\n=== Reaction of the Galician authorities and the press ===\n\nThe district administrator of Zbarazh, in a report to the High Imperial and Royal Governorship in Lviv, stated that the events in Hniliczki were a long-planned act of anti-state activity, as well as that:This attack is only an outburst of the widespread Russophile agitation to disturb the minds of peasants, to disrupt peace and order, and to incite hatred against nationalities.At the same time, this administrator, like the Greek Catholic priest of Hniliczki, claimed that there had never been any Russophile propaganda in the village, and the population did not express particular sympathy for Orthodoxy. In contrast, the gendarmerie from the town of Nowe Sioło, in a report to the district command in Zbarazh, stated that:Hniliczki had long suffered poverty and distress because they did not have their own local priest, which they had requested, and the authorities could not delegate one to them, so they sent a declaration to the authorities that they would convert to Orthodoxy.The Lviv press extensively covered the Hniliczki affair, accusing Russophiles of an anti-state conspiracy. Dziennik Polski stated that the agitation conducted by this group had become dangerous for the Austrian state and required a decisive counteraction. Similar comments appeared in other Polish newspapers. Kraków Czas interpreted the conversion as evidence of the internal decline of the Greek Catholic Church. Similar remarks were made in Gazeta Narodowa, Przegląd Lwowski, Gazeta Krakowska, Gazeta Kościelna, and Kurier Poznański.\nThe Greek Catholic Church itself sought to defuse the situation. Metropolitan Joseph Sembratovych issued a letter in defense of Catholicism on 31 December 1881, and two days earlier condemned the Russophile newspapers Prolom and Wicze. He also claimed that the critical opinions about the Church he led were exaggerated. However, after conducting preliminary investigations, which unequivocally established that the converts from Hniliczki were not motivated by religious reasons, the Austrian authorities decided to take decisive action against the Russophiles. This constituted a radical change from the previous attitude of the authorities towards this movement. Throughout the 1870s, Russophilia had been tolerated because it did not undermine the loyalty of Galician Ukrainians to Austria. The authorities only began to perceive it as dangerous at the end of the decade, with the development of the Russian pan-Slavic movement. Bernadetta Wójtowicz-Huber emphasizes that at the time of the scandal, Austro-Russian relations were particularly tense due to conflicting interests of both states in the Balkan region. Therefore, the Austrian authorities decided to use the entire affair as a pretext to eliminate the movement promoting the unification of Galicia with Russia.\nIn late January 1882, Father Ivan Naumovich, the editors of Russophile publications Josyf Markov and Wenedykt Płoszczański, court counselor Adolf Dobrianski (Dobrzański) and his daughter Olha Hrabar, as well as Ivan Szpunder and Oleksa Załuski, were arrested. Ultimately, Father Mykola Ohonowski, Russophile activist Apołon Nyczaj, and journalist Isydor Trembycki also stood accused. According to Stefan Kieniewicz, the Governor of Galicia, Andrzej Kazimierz Potocki, who had hitherto tolerated Russophile activities, now decided to repress them. The police searched the homes of the arrested individuals, finding a number of their letters and writings in which they expressed even more radical criticism of the Union of Brest and the Catholic Church in general than in their published texts, openly expressing their pro-Russian views. These materials were considered sufficient evidence to bring the most serious charges, including treason.\n\n\n=== Reaction of church authorities ===\nProvincial of the Jesuit Order, Henryk Jackowski, in a letter to the papal nuncio in Vienna, Serafino Vannutelli, described the Greek Catholic Church as \"riddled with schism\". This letter prompted Vannutelli to inform the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, whose prefect, Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni, was perplexed by the attitude of Greek Catholic clergy professing Russophile views. Vannutelli also contacted Metropolitan Joseph Sembratovych, urging him to take decisive action.\n\n\n== Trial of the Russophiles ==\nThe indictment against the Russophile group included charges of treason, espionage, and aspirations to detach Bukovina, parts of Hungary, and Eastern Galicia from Austria. The prosecutor accused the defendants of spreading Slavophile concepts in cooperation with the Slavic Charitable Committee, thereby engaging in activities favoring Russia. The involvement of some of the accused in the ceremonial movement in Galicia was also considered part of pro-Russian propaganda. According to Włodzimierz Osadczy, the charges were entirely unbelievable, and the alleged intentions of the accused went beyond the capabilities of the Russophiles. John-Paul Himka expressed a similar view.\nThe trial of the Russophiles, also known as the Olha (Olga) Hrabar and companions trial, began before the Regional Criminal Court in Lviv on 12 June 1882. The presiding judge of the tribunal was Lew Budzynowski, a Ukrainian nationalist.\nThe accused treated the trial as an opportunity to publicly express their political views. Testifying in court, Father Ivan Naumovich claimed that he acted out of \"humanism, religion, love\", convinced of the negative influence of the \"Jesuits\" on the Ruthenian population. He argued that Galician Ruthenians did not differentiate between their religion (Greek Catholicism) and Orthodoxy, regarding both as one \"Ruthenian faith\". He presented the view that fascination with Russian culture did not undermine loyalty to the Austrian state. He emphasized that he was not the organizer of a broader movement for conversion to Orthodoxy but merely hoped that such an act by the inhabitants of one village would prompt the Metropolitan of Lviv to convene a provincial Synod and the Pope to withdraw Jesuit and Resurrectionist orders from Galicia, which, in his opinion, contributed to the Polonization of the Ukrainian population. He also referred to issues not directly related to the trial, claiming that Polish-Ukrainian cooperation in Galicia would be possible if Ukrainians were guaranteed 47 seats in the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria, giving them a real opportunity to defend their own interests.\nThe Russophile press referred to the defendants as martyrs suffering from Polish intrigue. Even newspapers aligned with Ukrainian Russophile factions, usually hostile to Russophiles, expressed solidarity with the defendants and emphasized that the trial concerned the problems of the entire Ruthenian community in Galicia (this support waned after the trial). In some Polish circles, the case was also seen as artificially inflated. The Russian press and diplomacy protested strongly against the trial of the Russophiles. Konstantin Pobedonostsev, Ober-Procurator of the Most Holy Synod, personally lodged a protest letter at the Austro-Hungarian embassy. According to Czesław Partacz, it was only after the Hniliczek trial that the Austrian government realized the significant support the Russophiles received from Russia, the extent of pro-Orthodox and pro-Russian propaganda in their press, and the substantial support the movement received from the Greek Catholic Church hierarchy.\nAccording to Osadczy, the stance of the Russian diplomacy, and thus Austria's fear of worsening bilateral relations with Russia, may have influenced the final low sentences in the trial. On 29 July 1882, the court acquitted the defendants of the charge of treason. The evidence of their Russophile views did not support the prosecution's thesis of the existence of a widespread conspiracy to detach Galicia from Austria. Only M. Dobrianski was found guilty of collecting information about Ukrainian nationalists and socialists operating in Galicia. The court upheld the charge of disturbing public order. As a result, Father Naumovich was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment, Płoszczański to five, Szpunder and Załuski to three. The convicted were also burdened with court costs. The Supreme Court in Vienna confirmed the verdict of the lower court.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAccording to Włodzimierz Osadczy:The apostasy to Orthodoxy of the Galician community of Hniliczki in the Zbarazh district shook not only the province but also resonated loudly in the high offices of Vienna and the apostolic halls of Rome. (...) Vienna and Rome took a series of decisive steps to radically influence the condition of the Ruthenians and the Church, or rather the Greek Catholic rite.Pope Leo XIII, who closely monitored the situation in Galicia, removed from office the Greek Catholic metropolitan of Lviv, Joseph Sembratovych. He left Lviv in October 1882. He was replaced on the cathedral by his nephew, Sylwester Sembratowicz, a supporter of Polish-Ukrainian understanding and Latinization of the Greek Catholic rite. Together with Joseph Sembratovych from the chapter and consistory of Lviv, two canons with similar views also left, which contributed to the Church adopting a new political course, in line with the views of the newly appointed metropolitan.\nUnder the influence of the Hniliczki trial, the activity of the Russophiles also weakened. Some of them left for Russia, while others decided to temporarily limit their activities. The ritual movement also weakened, i.e., the activity of those Greek Catholic clergy who sought to remove Latin elements from the Greek Catholic liturgy. According to the Galician prefects, the Hniliczki affair caused the expected, i.e., deterrent effect. According to Czesław Partacz, Olha Hrabar's trial weakened the Russophile movement for the next twenty years. Despite the weakening of the Russophile movement, in the elections to the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria in 1883, its representatives obtained seven mandates, while Ukrainian nationalists only got four.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWójtowicz-Huber, Bernadetta (2008). \"Ojcowie narodu\".

        "earliest_creation_date": "2013-01-24 15:06:18",
        "content": "Fiorinia theae, the tea scale, is a polyphagous scale insect which is native to Asia and has been introduced into the Americas. It is widely distributed on both continents, especially in warmer regions. Apart from tea (Camellia sinensis), the host plants include a range of trees and shrubs, both ornamentals and crops. For example, other Camellia species, Citrus or Ilex (holly) species are part of the host range. Infested plants turn yellow and might die after heavy infestation.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFiorinia theae was originally described from tea plants in India and has been recorded also from various other countries in southern Asia, ranging from Sri Lanka in the west to the Philippines, Taiwan and southern China in the east.\nIt was introduced into the U.S. in the beginning of the 20th century and in 1908 was already recorded as a pest of ornamental camellias in South Carolina. It is now widely distributed in the Americas and has been recorded in most eastern and south-central states of the U.S., up to Texas and Kansas in the west and Indiana, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in the north. There are also reports from California. It is further found in Central America and in Argentina in South America.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe first instar larvae (crawlers) of Fiorinia theae are yellowish. The 2nd instar female is elongated with a dark brown scale cover, between 1.0 and 1.5 mm long. Immature males are smaller, less elongated and have a white scale cover. During heavy infestations, white wax secretions become abundant, giving the infected leaf a whitish appearance. Like in other scale insects, adult males are wasp-like with 1 pair of wings, one pair of halteres, and non-functional mouthparts.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFiorinia theae is a polyphagous scale insect of woody plants, infesting the underside of the leaves. Apart from tea plants in Asia, ornamental Camellia and Ilex species are the main hosts. Many other plants are infested less regularly. ScaleNet lists more than 20 genera from 18 plant families as hosts, including various crops and ornamental trees.\nThe development time and number of generations per year depends on the temperature. For example, in Florida, there are multiple, overlapping generations and all stages can be found throughout the year. In contrast, there are fewer generations in the northern states. The eggs laid by female scales hatch after 1–3 weeks and the crawlers disperse by moving to other parts of the host plant or spread by wind. After about one week, they become sessile, start feeding and after 10 more days moult to the 2nd instar stage. Second-instars start to develop a scale cover. Female scales moult only one more time and the adults remain within the second-instar exuviae. Male scales moult 3 more times. The total development time from egg hatching to adult females lasts 3–4 weeks. The development of males is slightly longer. There are several generations per year in the southern U.S. with one generation lasting 45 to 65 days.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nIn North America, ornamental Camellia and Ilex species experience the most serious damage from Fiorinia theae infestations. These plants are widely used in landscaping and the tea scale is a key pest of ornamentals in the south-eastern U.S. In other regions, damage on tea, citrus, dogwood, bottlebrush, kumquat, mango, and olive trees can be also significant. Extensive infestations by the scale insect causes yellowing of the leaves, premature leaf drop and branch dieback, up to death of the host plant.\nHowever, there is a range of susceptibility among ornamental Camellia and Ilex species. For example, in the south-eastern U.S. several non-native species like Camellia japonica or Ilex cornuta are highly susceptible to the scale insect and are often heavily infested. On the other hand, some native species like Ilex vomitoria and Ilex opaca are fairy resistant.\n\n\n== Management and biocontrol ==\nFiorinia theae infests the lower leaf surface of its host plant, making spraying with pesticides less effective. In addition, chemical pesticides can harm natural enemies and might not be able to penetrate the hard scale cover. The use of horticultural oils is less destructive to beneficial insects, but might not be able to control heavy infestations. Pruning of camellias in spring before the application of pesticides has been suggested for making these more effective.\nIn south-eastern North America, several wasps like Aphytis diaspidis have been recorded as parasitoids of F. theae. A variety of natural enemies has been reported from India. In 1976, Aphytis theae was released in Florida from India, but did not survive the winter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blackbird Bakery is a bakery on Bainbridge Island, in the U.S. state of Washington. Established in 1999, the business is owned by Jeff Shepard and Heidi Umphenour. The menu includes various pastries and desserts, as well as coffee and other drinks. Blackbird has garnered a positive reception.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBlackbird Bakery's shop is on Winslow Way East, on Bainbridge Island. The bakery has window seating and serves cakes, cookies, muffins, scones, pies, tarts, and other pastries and desserts, as well as quiches and soups. Blackbird also offers coffee and espresso drinks, as well as tea.\nAccording to Seattle Metropolitan, \"Downtowners, rolls of croissant dough dipped in vanilla sugar, have become a signature.\" The Helen's French Roll has been described as a \"minimalist-chic cousin\" to coffee cake. The shop serves toast with jam, and bakes various kinds of bread, including oatmeal and multigrain varieties.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlackbird opened in 1999. It is owned by Jeff Shepard and Heidi Umphenour, and has a \"sister\" establishment, Fork & Spoon. Umphenour's foot broke in multiple places when an oven exploded at Blackbird.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nLonely Planet Seattle recommends Blackbird for food when visiting Bainbridge Island. Allison Williams and Allecia Vermillion included the business in Seattle Metropolitan's 2021 list of ten \"sweet bakery day trips\" from the city. In 2023, Vermillion said Blackbird \"is basically the old guard in Bainbridge\". The Seattle Times called the bakery \"a big hit with islanders and tourists\" in 2022.\nFrommer's has called Blackbird's cookies and pastries \"good\". Northwest Travel & Life has recommended the Brioche Cinnamon Roll, and Seattle Magazine has recommended the quiches. In 2024, Aimee Rizzo and Kayla Sager-Riley of The Infatuation called the Helen's French Roll among the best pastries in the Puget Sound region, and said the blueberry scone with a lemon glaze \"is also a non-negotiable\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bakeries\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Blackbird Bakery at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

Launched in November 2023 as a YouTube Premium feature, the feature was released to select few countries to both desktop and mobile users.  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Playables feature was introduced in November 2023, initially available only in select countries and regions. Users within these specific regions who had the YouTube Premium subscription gained access to the Playables feature. In April 2024, the Playables feature was launched globally, eliminating the requirement for a YouTube Premium subscription to access the feature.\nUpon its release, YouTube provided users with the option to deactivate the platform on March 28, 2024, if they were dissatisfied with the feature. However, as of April 2024, the feature remains active on the platform.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTo access YouTube Playables, users have to click on a compass icon located on the YouTube interface. A sidebar will appear on the left side of the screen. Users then have to scroll down to the bottom of the recommended menu apps showcased on the sidebar that appears after clicking the compass. When users click on the Playables icon, users will be directed to a page of interactive embedded games.\nIf users stop playing a certain game on YouTube Playables, the application saves a file on the user's device. Users can access their game file through the YouTube application settings and delete their progress if desired. However, once the progress is deleted, users will need to restart the game from the beginning.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 123, is a cello sonata by Camille Saint-Saëns. It was composed in 1905 during the composer's stay in Biskra, Algeria, and was written nearly 30 years after his first cello sonata. The sonata was dedicated to Jules Griset, a long-time friend of the composer, and was first performed privately by cellist Joseph Hollmann and Saint-Saëns himself before receiving its public premiere by Auguste Tolbecque and Aline Riffaud.\nThe work features contrasting themes, intricate interplay between the two instruments, and a range of expressive and technical demands. The first movement, Maestoso largamente, presents two distinct musical ideas, while the second movement, a Scherzo con variazioni, consists of eight variations on a lively theme. The third movement, a lyrical Romanza, focuses on the cello's expressive qualities, and the finale, Allegro non troppo grazioso, concludes the work with a graceful and playful dialogue between the instruments.\nDespite Saint-Saëns's efforts to promote the sonata and its positive reception among critics and performers, it did not achieve the same level of popularity as his first cello sonata during his lifetime.\n\n\n== History ==\nCamille Saint-Saëns composed the sonata in March 1905 while staying in Biskra, Algeria, where he found ideal working conditions due to the quietness and mild weather. He had been reminded by his cellist friends and publisher Auguste Durand to write a second cello sonata, having composed his first, the Cello Sonata No. 1 in C minor, Op. 32, nearly 30 years earlier. On March 4, 1905, Saint-Saëns informed Durand that he had begun work on the new sonata. In subsequent letters, he described the work's concept and style, writing on March 16, \"The Sonata is almost finished. I am in the finale which constitutes the fourth paw of the quadruped; the second is a Scherzo con Variazioni, the third a Romanza that will make the cellists happy.\" Two days later, he reported, \"It is finally finished, this accursed sonata! Will it please or not? That is the question. It is rather difficult, but not unduly so.\"\nThe sonata was first performed privately on April 13, 1905, at the home of Albert Blondel, the director of the Érard piano factory, by cellist Joseph Hollmann and the composer himself. Saint-Saëns later recounted how, the day before the performance, Hollmann appeared to him, visibly distressed, and confessed that he had forgotten his score in a carriage. Saint-Saëns, undeterred by the predicament, offered to rewrite the entire sonata, and spent part of the night and the following day on the task, and the performance took place as scheduled. Saint-Saëns reflected that the unfortunate incident had a positive outcome, as the new copy, although created under time pressure, turned out to be superior to the original.\nThe public premiere was given by Auguste Tolbecque and pianist Aline Riffaud on October 27, 1905, in Niort, before the dedicatee, Jules Griset, performed it with Saint-Saëns in Paris on November 7. Griset was a long-time friend of Saint-Saëns who owned a private theatre and occasionally played the piano accompaniment at the musical society La Trompette. Griset expressed his gratitude for the dedication in a letter dated September 3, 1905: \"Yesterday, your publisher sent me your – oh, what am I saying – my Sonata. [...] It is superb, full of poetry and delectable surprises, and I thank you for the great honour that you have bestowed upon my humble self by placing my name above it.\"\nThe work was published by Durand in July 1905. Saint-Saëns continued to promote the sonata, performing it with various cellists during his concert tours. In a letter to Jacques Durand on July 13, 1906, he wrote, \"Enormous success yesterday at Hollmann's concert. The first appearance of the new sonata could not have been better received; Hollmann played it admirably as well as the [First Sonata], where I finally heard the phrase of the finale rendered as it should be. [...] Decidedly, if there is no mistake, the Second [Sonata] is very superior to the first.\"\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe sonata consists of four movements.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe sonata received positive reviews following its premiere. The critic from Le Ménestrel wrote of the work, \"The work, which deserves a lengthy analysis, is one of his most beautiful productions. The themes are of a rare freshness and originality, and the developments dazzling.\" However, despite Saint-Saëns's efforts to promote the sonata through his concert tours and reports of enthusiastic responses from audiences and critics, it did not achieve the same level of success as his first cello sonata. This may be attributed to a general preference for his earlier works from the 1870s and 1880s, which were favored even during the composer's lifetime. Additionally, the technical demands placed on the performers in the second sonata, despite its abundance of rhythmic and harmonic refinements, may have contributed to its lesser popularity compared to the first sonata. Saint-Saëns himself acknowledged this in a letter to his publisher on March 16, 1905, stating, \"Naturally the Second Sonata will not be worth the first; when La Fontaine published his second collection of fables, everyone by common agreement declared it inferior to the first. One must resign oneself to the inevitable.\"\nDespite these factors, the sonata was appreciated by those who performed it. Cellist Pierre Destombes, who played the work with Saint-Saëns on April 27, 1908, at Salle Pleyel, was praised by the composer in a letter to Jacques Durand on December 27, 1912: \"Destombes plays the Romance of my Second Sonata as one dreams of hearing it. The sound, the charm, the style, it is ideal.\" Watson Lyle described the sonata as \"an elaborate and musicianly brilliant, rather than an emotionally intense, work. It demands technique of a high grade from both performers, throughout.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCello Sonata No. 2 (Saint-Saëns): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project",

        "content": "Ștefan Buchiu (pronounced [ˈʃte.fan ˈbu.kʲu]; born March 27, 1953) is a Romanian Orthodox cleric and theologian known for his work in Orthodox dogmatic theology. He is an emeritus professor at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Orthodox Theology and currently serves as an Honorary Diocesan Vicar at the Archdiocese of Bucharest within the Romanian Orthodox Church. He served as the dean of this faculty from 2008 to 2018.\nHis academic work draws extensively on the theological insights of the prominent Romanian theologian Father Dumitru Stăniloae, focusing on the comprehension and communication of Orthodox theology.\n\n\n== Early Life and Education ==\nBorn in Pitești, Argeș County, Ștefan Buchiu was raised in a family deeply ingrained in the Orthodox faith, being the son of priest Piru Buchiu and presbytera Viorica Buchiu. The family environment emphasized religious service, with Ștefan being the youngest of five children, four of whom pursued clerical careers.\nȘtefan Buchiu began his theological studies in 1968 at the Theological Seminary in Craiova, graduating in 1973. He continued his education at the University Theological Institute in Bucharest from 1973 to 1977, where he distinguished himself academically, graduating as valedictorian. His pursuit of advanced theological studies led him to undertake doctoral research at the same institution from 1977 to 1980, with further studies at the Bossey Ecumenical Institute, University of Geneva, Switzerland, during 1983–1984.\nIn 1993, Buchiu defended his doctoral thesis, titled Incarnation and Unity. The Restoration of the Cosmos in Jesus Christ at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology, University of Bucharest. This work was supervised by Fr. Prof. Dumitru Popescu and is noted for contributing to the field of Orthodox Dogmatic Theology.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nIn 1990, Ștefan Buchiu began his tenure at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology at the University of Bucharest, initially serving as a university assistant. Throughout the years, he progressed through academic positions, from lecturer to associate professor, and was appointed as a university professor and doctoral advisor in Orthodox Dogmatic Theology in 2007. During his professorship, he worked on enhancing the theological curriculum to offer a comprehensive education in Orthodox studies.\nFrom 2008 to 2018, Buchiu served as the Dean of the Faculty of Orthodox Theology, and from 2009 to 2013, he also took on the role of Director of the Doctoral School. Similar to graduate programs in the US, this school oversees the research and studies of Ph.D. students.\nIn 2015, the 'Patriarch Justinian' Faculty of Orthodox Theology added a new level to its building, increasing the number of classrooms and advancing the restoration of its century-old building. These developments, which occurred during Fr. Prof. Buchiu's tenure as dean, aimed to improve the faculty's infrastructure. His role in these projects was acknowledged with the Diploma of Honour of Saint Andrew the Apostle during the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the Romanian Orthodox Church's elevation to Patriarchate status.\n\n\n== International Collaboration and Impact ==\nDuring his tenure, Fr. Ștefan Buchiu actively engaged in fostering international collaborations, expanding faculty collaborations with Orthodox theological institutions globally. His efforts were directed towards facilitating academic dialogues, exchanges, and cooperative projects, contributing to a more interconnected Orthodox academic community.\nBuchiu was involved in establishing partnerships with various Orthodox theological academies and universities around the world, including Kyiv, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Athens, Balamand, and Fribourg. These collaborations aimed to enhance academic dialogue and support unity within the global Orthodox theological education network.\nUnder his direction, a collaboration was initiated with Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in the US, starting in 2013. This partnership included student and faculty exchanges, alongside joint dialogues and publications, and was aimed at contributing to theological education and fostering understanding between Orthodox communities in Romania and the United States.\nIn 2017, under the guidance of Patriarch Daniel of Romania and with significant contributions from Buchiu, the \"Patriarch Justinian\" Faculty of Orthodox Theology at the University of Bucharest initiated an educational extension in Rome, Italy. This initiative was designed to meet the interest of the Romanian diaspora in pursuing Orthodox theological studies in their native language. Buchiu was instrumental in establishing this extension, which offers a curriculum similar to its parent institution in Bucharest, thereby facilitating theological education for Romanian Orthodox students living abroad.\n\n\n== Contributions and Scientific Activity ==\nFather Ștefan Buchiu has authored more than 100 academic studies and articles in the field of Orthodox theology, engaging in theological discourse and exploring complex theological concepts.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nIncarnation and Unity (Intrupare și unitate), 1997, ISBN 973-9016-50-2\nOrthodoxy and Secularization (Ortodoxie și secularizare), 1999 ISBN 973-9016-89-8\nApophatic Knowledge in the Thought of Father Staniloae (Cunoașterea apofatică în gândirea Părintelui Staniloae), 2002,  ISBN 978-606-8495-30-9\nChristian and Social Apostolate of the Romanian Orthodox Church 1925-2005 (Apostolatul creștin și social al B.O.R. 1925-2005), co-author, 2005,  ISBN 973-7737-45-8\nDogma and Theology, vol.

As one who has closely studied under Stăniloae, Buchiu has extensively engaged with and built upon his mentor's theological concepts, underscoring their importance for both the Romanian Orthodox tradition and the broader Christian community.\nIn discussions on theological perspectives, Buchiu has highlighted Stăniloae's shift from theoretical academic study to a theology that is more experiential and personal. This approach emphasizes a direct and personal encounter with Christ, aiming to foster a living faith within the community of the Church.\nFather Ștefan Buchiu contributed to honoring Father Dumitru Stăniloae's legacy through the \"Rev. Academician Dumitru Staniloae\" Theology Contest. This annual contest, targeting theological students, promotes the study of Stăniloae's theological works, encouraging a new generation to explore his profound contributions to Orthodox theology. For example, in 2015, the winners were recognized by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, highlighting Buchiu's role in connecting Staniloae's teachings with contemporary theological scholarship.\nProf. Buchiu's anthology, Father Dumitru Stăniloae, the Theologian of Divine Love gathers 20 articles that delve into Stăniloae's significant theological contributions. This collection not only highlights Buchiu's engagement with Stăniloae's theology but also its application to modern Christian life, promoting an experiential faith deeply rooted in the Holy Tradition of the Orthodox church.\nOn the 30th anniversary of Stăniloae's death, Buchiu underscored the ongoing relevance of his work for today's theological discourse and Orhtodox practice. He encourages engagement with Stăniloae's writings as a pathway to deepen theological understanding and enhance faith practice, reflecting on Stăniloae's approach to theology that encompasses contemplation as well as social engagement.\n\n\n== Awards and Honors ==\nHe has received recognition both from academic institutions and the Church for his contributions to theology and higher education. For his commitment and exceptional contributions in the theological field, Fr. Ștefan Buchiu has received multiple distinctions and recognitions throughout his career.\n\nThe Cross for Priests, awarded by Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of the Armenians, Echmiadzin,  Armenia, 1996\nElevation to Archpriest, awarded by Patriarch Teoctist of Romania, 2005\nHonorary Citizen of Corbu, Olt County, since 2011\nPresident of the College of Deans of the Faculties of Orthodox Theology of the Romanian Patriarchate (2012 – 2018)\nThe Order of Holy Great Sovereigns Constantine and Helen, 2017\nVice President of the International Association of Orthodox Dogmatists, continuously serving since 2018, participating in various international conferences to contribute to the global Orthodox theological dialogue\nThe title of emeritus professor conferred by the Senate of the University of Bucharest, 2018\nThe rank of Honorary Diocesan Vicar granted by His Beatitude Patriarch Daniel of Romania, 2018\nRight to wear the Patriarchal Cross of Romania, the highest ecclesiastical distinction in the Romanian Orthodox Church, awarded by His Beatitude Patriarch Daniel of Romania\nThe Order of Holy Brâncoveanu Martyrs, 2020\nThe title of Doctor Honoris Causa awarded by the University of Craiova, 2022\n\n\n=== Commemorative events ===\nProf. Buchiu's 70th birthday was marked by a commemorative event at the \"Patriarch Justinian\" Faculty of Orthodox Theology, University of Bucharest. This event celebrated the launch of a festschrift titled In the Light of Christ: Homage to Fr. Prof. Ștefan Buchiu, featuring contributions from academic scholars and ecclesiastical officials. Notably, Patriarch Daniel of Romania provided a foreword, stating: \"For over three decades, Father Professor Ștefan Buchiu has conducted an extensive teaching tenure... demonstrating considerable rigor, seriousness, and generosity. He has supported the development and recognition of multiple generations of theologians... [and] exemplifies diligence, enthusiasm, and selfless dedication to the welfare of the Church, thorough scholarship, and academic earnestness in the advancement of Romanian theological education.\"\n  This endorsement highlights Prof. Buchiu's significant role and reputation within the field of Orthodox theology. The event was attended by bishops, prominent academics, and students, reinforcing the professor's esteemed standing in the theological academic community. Additional accolades included a blessing from Archbishop Casian Crăciun and the delivery of Patriarch Daniel's message by Vicar Bishop Timotei of Prahova.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFather Professor Ștefan Buchiu - University of Bucharest\nInternational Association of Orthodox Dogmatic Theologians - Official website \nEditorial Team of the International Journal of Orthodox Theology - University of Bamberg, Germany\nȘtefan Buchiu publications indexed by Google Scholar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adela Peralta Leppe (13 November 1929 - 22 March 2018), also known by her stage name Tiki Tiki, was a Mexican actress, singer, dancer, journalist, clown and union activist. Throughout her career spanning several decades, she stood out as one of the pioneering female clowns in Mexico, while also actively advocating for labour rights within her profession.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAdela Peralta Leppe began her career in 1948 when she joined the artistic company \"México Lindo\" in Acapulco, and then toured Mexico and Central America with them. She later formed her own ballet company called \"Las Leppe Sisters\", which performed alongside artists such as Damaso Pérez Prado and Bill Haley & His Comets in Mexico and in Europe. The composer Luis Arcaraz composed the song \"Dulce\" specifically for her company to perform.\nIn the 1950s, Peralta Leppe began visiting primary schools to provide entertainment, as many families couldn't afford to hire a clown privately. The singer and composer Daniel Santos gave her the nickname Tiki Tiki, a name she adopted for her six-decade-long career as a clown. She affirmed: \"Tiki Tiki was born as a result of my social work.\" Her dedication to this role earned her the title of \"Senior Clown\" by the Latin Clown Brotherhood.\nIn addition to her acting career, she actively promoted labour rights within her industry. She was voted a union delegate and was a lifelong member of the National Association of Actors (ANDA) – specifically, the “Tent, Circus, and Children's Parties\" section of the union. Alongside Dolores del Río, she was an ardent campaigner for the construction of childcare centres for women affiliated with the ANDA.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPeralta Leppe was a world champion angler, having won the 1956 International Tarpon Fishing Tournament in Tampico. She caught a 76 kg (168 lb) Atlantic tarpon measuring 3 meters, the largest caught by a woman.\nPeralta Leppe was a victim of the 2017 Mexico City earthquake when the building where she lived collapsed. She remained trapped for 30 hours until being rescued and was hospitalized for several months as a result. She died on 22 March 2018, in Mexico City.\n\n\n== References ==",

Following the duo's unveil, twelve dates for their tour were announced by their record label Avex Trax. On October 23, Avex announced the tour's supporting album With. Due to high demand, two additional dates were announced for the Fukuoka Dome and Kyocera Dome Osaka on November 1. On December 10, the official tour logo was revealed along with the announcement that two more dates were added in April for the Tokyo Dome, extending the With Tour to sixteen shows. The tour's official website and merchandise were launched on January 8, 2015.\n\n\n== Recordings and broadcast ==\nThe final two shows at the Tokyo Dome on April 1–2 were filmed and released as a DVD and Blu-ray concert film on August 19, 2015, through Avex Trax in Japan. The DVD and Blu-ray were commercially successfully, debuting at number one on the Oricon chart. The DVD charted for sixteen weeks, while the Blu-ray charted for fourteen weeks. Five songs from the setlist were made available for download as a live EP, which was also released on August 19.\nThe tour's final show on April 2 in Tokyo was also streamed live in various cinemas across Japan. The show was broadcast as a television special on June 13, 2015, airing on Fuji Television. It featured exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and an interview where Tohoshinki reflect on their ten years since debut in Japan. The broadcast re-ran through 2016.\n\n\n== Setlist ==\nThis setlist is representative of the first show in Fukuoka.

        "content": "Ameer Al-Zalaam or Ameer Al-Thalaam (Egyptian Arabic: أمير الظلام, lit. 'Prince of Darkness') an Egyptian film that debuted on June 22, 2002, shines a light on the resilience and strength of the human spirit amidst adversity. Directed by Ramy Imam, the movie features a cast that includes Adel Emam, Sherine Saif al-Nasr, and Youssef Dawoud. Distributed by Al Arabia Cinema Production & Distribution, the film achieved notable success in the Egyptian market. The Egyptian Air Force assisted the crew in several scenes. Some critics said that the movie's idea was taken from Scent of a Woman (1992).\nAt its core, Ameer Al-Zalaam unfolds the gripping tale of Saeed Al-Masry (Arabic: سعيد المصري) (portrayed by Adel Emam), a former pilot haunted by the scars of the October War. Blinded by the trauma of his past, Saeed finds himself confined to a home for the visually impaired, where bureaucratic oppression reigns supreme. Refusing to succumb to the limitations imposed upon him, Saeed embarks on a transformative journey, igniting a spark of hope within the confines of his seemingly bleak reality. His quest for freedom and redemption paves the way for an inspiring narrative that transcends physical boundaries and celebrates the power of human connection.\nAmidst the darkness that pervades Saeed's world, rays of light emerge in the form of newfound relationships and unexpected allies. Encountering Alia (played by Sherine Saif Al-Nasr), a compassionate artist with whom he shares a profound connection, Saeed discovers solace amidst the chaos. Together, they navigate the tumultuous waters of love and courage, confronting external threats and inner demons alike.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrative of the film centers around Saeed Al-Masry (Adel Emam), a valiant pilot who served during the October 1973 war. Tragically, his sight is taken from him when his aircraft is engulfed in flames during combat. As a consequence, he finds himself confined to a residence for the visually impaired, overseen by a domineering figure who transforms the sanctuary into a stifling prison (Youssef Dawoud). Despite the oppressive atmosphere, Saeed staunchly refuses to yield to his perceived limitations. Instead, he embarks on a mission to impart newfound perspectives to his fellow residents, delving into the intricacies of color and the essence of freedom.\nWithin the confines of this unlikely community, bonds of familial love flourish, uniting Saeed and his peers in a shared journey of discovery and resilience. Amidst this backdrop, fate leads Saeed to Alia (Sherine Saif al-Nasr), a talented visual artist whose empathy resonates deeply with him. Their chance encounter at a local disco sparks the beginning of an emotional connection, as Saeed finds solace in confiding his story to Alia, who offers unwavering support.\nHowever, tranquility is shattered when a ruthless terrorist faction descends upon the residence, wreaking havoc and devastation. In a harrowing turn of events, lives are lost, and the sanctity of the home is violated as the terrorists pillage its resources. With the threat escalating to a potential attack on a presidential convoy, Saeed finds himself thrust into a dire situation. Returning to the scene of chaos, he confronts the grim reality of his fallen comrades and springs into action to thwart the impending catastrophe, ultimately emerging as a beacon of hope in the face of darkness.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAdel Emam: Said Al-Masry\nSherine Saif Al-Nasr: Alia\nYoussef Dawoud: Zulfi\nTawfiq Abdel Hamid: Hashem (police officer)\nDonia Abdel Aziz: Nada\nDiaa Abdel Khaleq: Azzam\nKhaled Sarhan: Saadoun\nTamer Abdel Moneim: Ashraf\nJarir Mansour: Marcus\nAbdullah Saad: Alberto\nAhmed El-Tohamy: Max\nAlaa Zeinhom: Employee at the house\nReda Hamed: Ebadah (Al-Tayyar)\nSaeed Saleh: Guest of honor (coach of the opposing team)\nYounis Shalabi: Referee of the bell ball match\nRagaa Al Geddawy: Guest of honor\nEnas Makki: Guest of honor\nSaeed Abdel Ghani: Guest of honor\nMahmoud Azab: Match commentator\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmeer Al-Thalaam at IMDb \nAmeer Al-Thalaam at Letterboxd.\nAmeer Al-Thalaam at Kinopoisk.",

        "content": "Dave Letterfly Knoderer (born 1953) is an American artist known for his versatile talents with sign painting, airbrush artistry, gold leaf gilding, and pinstriping, and is also a classic horseman and entertainer. Letterfly – a word coined in 1976 by artist Dave Knoderer to use as his brush name, was officially registered as a business trademark in 1988 and legally became part of his name in 2022. The moniker Letterfly was an upgrade from his teenage alias Krazee Davee.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nDave grew up on the Wittenberg University campus as the son of a mezzo-soprano opera singer mother and a Lutheran minister father. Creativity began at an early age when little David began to imitate the themed homecoming displays built by the fraternity and sorority houses each fall with clever versions of his own. Imprinted with his father's love for the circus and inspired by the annual visit of the Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros Circus, Dave produced his backyard circus each summer. Although majoring in music and art throughout school, frustrations at home forced his decision to trust a hunch and at sixteen he launched himself into a life of adventure.\nDave took his set of drums and a few paintbrushes and spent the summer on a touring tent circus that made one-day stands. His creative drum licks enhanced the audience experience of the Clark & Walters Circus. Painting artwork on the fleet quickly evolved into other creative outlets in this interesting culture. As a nineteen-year-old animal training understudy, he created and learned how to perform with his six-pony liberty act. His performing palominos toured most of North America and half of Canada for many seasons.\nIn 1973, Dave officially began his career hand painting signs for the community of Clarklake between circus tours. Commissioned work expanded when Jim Elliott, manager of the W. G. Wade Shows in Michigan, hired him to create a pattern of their masthead to use to decorate the fleet. Later, in the role of show painter for the Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros Circus, and the Elliott Amusement Company, Dave's innovative decorations rocketed his reputation.\nIn 1979, he became an apprentice in the sign painting trade, enhancing his lettering and composition skills while working on various projects. Dave's association with the Letterheads, a group of sign painter tradesmen, expanded opportunities to exchange information about gold leaf gilding, specialty brush techniques, faux painted effects, and historic aspects of the sign trade.\nRemaining passionate about the performing artform that utilized specialty-trained horses, Dave continued developing and performing with a series of three dancing horses over three decades. A picture of him astride his second horse, Class N Sass, is on display at the Museum of the Horse in Kentucky Horse Park. His horsemanship career evolved into having a command of the highest form of classic horsemanship – the Haute E ‘Cole or high school horse. Astride the American Saddlebred, he trained to the highest level, Dave on Souveran secured first place at the Sarasota International Circus Festival and Talent Competition in 1989. He also developed and performed many admirable antics with his jet-black mule in their comedy routine as \"Gold Dust and the Old Cuss.\"\n\n\n== RV’s and motorcycles ==\nThe advent of the computer introduced the demise of the hand-lettering sign man. Fortunately, Letterfly was in the right place at the right time and discovered an emerging trend - the RV industry had begun producing large diesel-pusher motorhomes in the mid-eighties. Ma and Pa USA wanted their motor coach to look like a country music tour bus with airbrushed murals of stagecoaches, eagles flying over the mountains, wolves in the desert, underwater coral reef scenes, and custom images of all kinds. Since Dave, having performed with the circus, knew how to travel, he was able to capitalize on this roving market and thrive. While chasing the work all over the country for nine years solid, Letterfly became the most prolific of all the artists on the RV scene. Becoming the premier producer of custom murals attracted the attention of Don Wallace, who was busy building the Disney of RV dealerships in Tampa. Don wanted everything that an RVer could want on his property. Having the best artist in the country was part of his vision. In 1995 Letterfly began his notable residency at Lazydays and thrived there for fifteen years.\nAs technology introduced a new way for RV exteriors to be painted, and digitally printed images took over the market, Dave adapted by responding to demands for murals in the emerging upscale Harley-Davidson retail facilities. In that environment, Dave discovered another market for his unique skillset - pinstriping for bikers by hand with paint. Today he enjoys a route of customer-dedicated motorcycle dealerships from Philadelphia to Chicago where he adds to the fun of motorcycling.\n\n\n== Author and motivational speaker ==\nWriting started with creating marketing content at the brink of the RV trend and evolved into a series of entertaining anecdotes, philosophical interludes, magazine articles, and published essays - many of which are parked on his blog entitled LetterflyWrites. Dave also sends out a bi-monthly e-mail newsletter entitled \"Tales of a Traveling Airbrush.\" Soon the author had enough material for a book, and then two, and then three. With the help of his creative writing professor friend, Dave became a published author with his first memoir \"Speedy Hurled through Havoc\" which reveals part of his interesting life. Other titles include - \"Hit the Road and Thrive,\" - \"The Galloping Snapper,\" - \"Kinker Circusing the Seventies,\" - and \"Rolling Art, Why a Mural?\"\nFuture books in the works include - \"Red Sorrel on the Road Home,\" - \"Responsible RVing,\" - \"One Man Show,\" and \"Rolling Motorcycle Art.\"\nAs a member of Toastmasters International Letterfly ongoingly develops and delivers speeches of hope and inspiration to his audience. Dave produces informative seminars, encouraging keynote talks, and entertaining workshops for various clubs, artist's guilds, civic groups, and fellowships. Letterfly remains dedicated to encouraging his audience to transform challenges into opportunities using stories from his colorful life and career that proves to be a heartwarming example for his audience.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThanks to the design for living introduced through the AA recovery community, Letterfly remains dedicated to being of service to his fellows. Through maintaining a connection with God, Dave continuously seeks inspiration to help others transform their challenges one heart-warming story at a time.\nDedicated to the promotion of environmental health, the practice of regular meditation, exercise, mindfulness, and finding ways to benefit his community, Dave fills his time with creative fabrication projects for several circuses, writing about his interesting life, ballroom dancing, painting artwork, and gardening during the winter months at his home called ArtPark in Florida.\nDuring the summer months, you will find him enjoying the RV lifestyle along his seven-month route of Harley-Davidson stores east of the Mississippi where he serves customers with hand-painted pinstriping, lettering, and pictorial images of all kinds along with gilded effects. A relentless showman, these designs are created right before your eyes as a value-added attraction and form of entertainment.\n\n\n== Awards and preservation ==\nDave received accolades during his role as a sign painter in Jackson, Michigan when he won the Signs of the Times annual design competition for a storefront he conceived and painted in 1986.\nVisitors to the Jackson County Historical Museum learn about the rich history of Brownstown, Indiana thanks to the special fabricated works of stylized art created to pay homage to the artist's humble beginning that also tells the story of the family, the elephants, and the circus that called the Hoosier state home.\nLetterfly donated all the framed marketing artwork used during his residency at Lazydays and other curiosities that celebrate the brief era of rolling artwork on RVs to the RV Heritage Museum of Elkhart Indiana.\nDave remains dedicated to preserving and promoting various aspects of historical value by creating special sign work and examples of pinstriping on motorcycles to benefit visitors of Laugerman's Memories Museum in York, Pennsylvania.\nA dedicated renaissance man fond of outdoor show business, Letterfly remains uniquely qualified to create nostalgic sign work to celebrate the old-time circus banner painter and carnival ride decorator. The artist is ongoingly creating new examples of the show painter's art to expand personal collections. Plus, his old portable airbrush T-shirt booth is now on display at the Showman's Museum in Gibsonton, Florida.\n\n\n== Seminars, workshops, podcasts and publications ==\nLetterfly teaches all aspects of the old-school artisan once a year at his home in Florida. During the week-long training called Custom Paint Workshops, Letterfly provides instruction with hand lettering, pinstriping, airbrushing, pictorial painting, and gold leaf gilding during the first week of February.\nHis Udemy online course entitled Stuck No More – Turning Dreams into Plans is designed to encourage everyday people bored with routine, lacking helpful direction, and a desire for the courage to step fearlessly forward into the unknown.\nLetterfly regularly participates as a guest on Podcasts and broadcast television and radio shows of all kinds. Articles about the artist and his horses have appeared in American Saddlebred Magazine, Auto Art Magazine, Family Motor Coach Magazine, RV Business, Circus Report, Amusement Business, and Bus Conversion Magazine. Dave also writes informative and entertaining articles for publications and magazines including Born to Ride, RV Living, and Western Horseman.\n\n\n== Partnerships ==\nLetterfly remains available with an imaginative vision for a better tomorrow to partner with like-minded conservation groups, spiritual individuals, avid horsemen, and dedicated healing fellowships who desire contribution, encouragement, instruction, and direction.\n\n\n== References ==",

The creek skirts Lake Waxahachie, flowing under U.S. Highway 77 before flowing into Lake Bardwell  near Ennis.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest settlers of the area were the families of William Alden Hawkins and Larkin Newton, who moved to the area in 1848. For Hawkins to claim his 640 acres (260 ha) of land from the Peters Colony group, he was required to build a house on the property he chose along the mouth of Waxahachie Creek before July 1, 1848. The structure was built before the required deadline, and the land near the present-day Hawkins Spring went to the Hawkins family.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Artybius (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτύβιος) was a general of ancient Persia during the reign of Darius the Great (that is, around the 5th or 6th centuries BCE). After the Ionian Revolt had broken out, he sailed with a fleet to Cyprus to conquer that island.\nIn 497 BCE, the general Onesilus of Salamis, the head among the chiefs of Cyprus, asked to face Artybius in combat. Artybius accepted the offer, and rode out on his horse to face Onesilus and his attendant, who were on foot. The historian Herodotus relates an anecdote that Onesilus believed Artybius to have trained his horse to rear up and attack on command, and, after discussion with his attendant, when Artybius's horse did in fact make such an attack, Onesilus engaged Artybius and then he (or his attendant) chopped off the rearing horse's leg with his sickle. The horse fell on top of Artybius, allowing him to be slain easily.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Schmitz, Leonhard (1870). \"Artybius\".

He took an active part in the Orlovian revolution after the unfortunate outcome of which he escaped on a Russian ship to Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Ioannina in 1720. He was metropolitan of Old Patras during the periods 1750-1756 and 1759–1770. He replaced Gerasimos the Theraeus both times. He possessed great education and was an excellent connoisseur of the Ancient Greek language.\nIn 1766 he built the church of Faneromeni in Aigio. In Orlov revolt, being in Aigio he raised the flag of the revolution and expelled the Ottomans from the city and then campaigned against the Kalavryta. Then the abbot of Mega Spilaio holding a cross and together with the monks with threats and Christian admonitions managed to break the siege of the city under Parthenios, to enter and receive all the Turkish families with the their sacred relics and to transport them safely to Crissian Gulf or Gulf of Itea.\nAfter the failure of that revolution, Parthenios fled first to Zakynthos, under the protection of the Russian fleet, and later to Saint Petersburg begging at the court of Catherine the Great. There the Tsarina granted him some land for his livelihood, since he could not return to his seat due to his deposing.\nHe died in 1786 and was buried in Moscow in the Donskoy Monastery where his tomb still exists today.\n\nThe Mega Spilaio, for the help it had provided to Turkish families, was especially honored by the Sultan by granting a permanent guard of honor from Albanians, while the Kalavryta did not have any adverse impact.\n\n\n== Legends ==\nDuring his tenure, there was a great drought in Patras, so it was decided that all the denominations and religions of the city should pray. First the Muslims came out but nothing happened, then the Jews, again nothing. When it was the turn of the Christians, who gathered in the temple of the Prophet Elijah and began the litany, before they could complete it a torrential rain came.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nΣτέφανος Θωμόπουλος, Ιστορία της πόλεως των Πατρών, Τόμος Α΄, έκδοση τέταρτη, Αχαϊκές εκδόσεις 1998, ISBN 960-7960-10-6.\nΚ.

        "content": "RSEA Engineering Corporation (RSEA; Chinese: 榮工工程股份有限公司) is a Taiwanese construction company. Founded as a sub-agency under the Veterans Affairs Council in 1956, it was known as the Retired Servicemen's Engineering Agency or Ret-Ser Engineering Agency (Chinese: 榮民工程事業管理處). It was reorganized as a state-controlled company in 1998 then privatized in 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1956, the RSEA was formed as a government agency that employed retired soldiers. The agency's first major project was the Central Cross-Island Highway, which was completed in four years \"at the cost of one hundred dead and another two hundred men badly injured.\" In the 1970s, the agency was fully or partially responsible for eight of the Ten Major Construction Projects, namely China Steel in Kaohsiung, Port of Suao in Yilan County, National Freeway 1.\nIn 1965, the agency expanded its projects overseas and opened an office in Saudi Arabia in 1972. As of 1982, it had been awarded more than $1.23 billion of contracts in Saudi Arabia. Notable projects included the Sha'ar descent from Abha to Jizan.\nAs of 1986, the agency generated NT$25.1 billion (US$830 million) in revenue but only 0.72% in net profit margin, far below the 8% benchmark set by the Ministry of Finance. With the liberalization of the economy and increased competition, calls to transition the agency into a corporation started growing.\nIn 1991, RSEA negotiated a pilot project to build the Hsuehshan Tunnel and other drives on National Freeway 5. Construction started in July 1991, was initially expected to complete in 1995, but lasted 12 years instead.\n\n\n=== Privatization ===\n\nIn 2021, RSEA and its contractors faced fines of NT$300,000 (approximately US$10,800) for a scaffolding collapse on a work site that led to three deaths. Jointly with Samsung C&T Corporation, RSEA won the contract to work on Taoyuan International Airport's Terminal 3, slated to be completed in 2026.\n\n\n== Baseball sponsorship ==\nIn 1971, under the leadership of Yen Hsiao-chang (嚴孝章), RSEA established a U-12 youth baseball program in Hualien County. Three years later, the core team of the U-12 team formed the senior league team. The big league team was formed in 1977. The next year, the three teams moved to Banqiao in Taipei County.\nIn 1979, the RSEA senior league team defeated Taipei's Huaxing High School (華興) in the northern regional championship, ending Huaxing's 7-year championship streak. RSEA then defeated Pingtung County's Meihe Senior High School (美和) in the national tryout tournament. In doing so, RSEA became a third dominant force in high school baseball, disrupting the \"Huaxing in the North, Meihe in the South\" (北華興、南美和) rivalry.\nAs of 2004, RSEA no longer operated its own youth baseball team but instead supported Qiangshu High School's baseball program through an annual donation of NT$5 million (approximately US$150,000). Despite signing a 3-year deal, the prospect of continuing the sponsorship was in question due to the privatization process of the company.\nNotable alumni of the RSEA programs include Chin-Feng Chen, Chien-Ming Wang, Yeh Chun-chang, among others.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average lifespan of a population.\nIt differs from maximum life expectancy, known as \"potential longevity\", in that it varies according to the age at which it is measured. Moreover, the value of life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the infant mortality rate.\nIt is used for living organisms,with human life expectancy and that of plants and animals, but also for objects, instruments or organizations, only when it is possible to attribute an age to them, and thus to know the date of creation, appearance or first use, and to identify an event comparable to death for living organisms (destruction, disappearance, definitive breakdown, etc.).\n\n\n== History of human life expectancy ==\n\n\n=== Eighteenth-century mortality tables ===\nMajor advances in life expectancy and its estimation were made from the middle of the 18th century, thanks to the mortality tables successively published by Antoine Deparcieux (1746), Théodore Tronchin (1748), Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin (1749), Thomas Simpson (1752), Johann Peter Süssmilch (1761), and Daniel Bernoulli (1763), according to whom vaccination against smallpox increased overall life expectancy by three years.\n\n\n=== Stagnation and setbacks at the end of the 20th century ===\nSince the end of the 20th century, life expectancy has begun to fall or stagnate in some countries (in France in 2012, for example), and for the first time in 250 years (excluding wartime periods); it has stagnated for men and fallen slightly for women. According to INED (by its French acronym) and the harmonized  European indicator calculated by Eurostat: \"In 2012, life expectancy did not increase...It stagnated for men (78,4 years) and even fell by 0,2 points for women (84,8 years)\", while life expectancy in good health (or \"life expectancy without activity limitation\") is declining in many countries.\n\n\n=== The respective roles of genes and behavior ===\nGeneticists are also seeking to understand the extent to which our genes influence our life expectancy. According to a recent study based on a family tree constructed by crowdsourcing for 13 million people, these genes are of little importance compared to environmental and behavioral factors: 16%, compared with around 25% previously thought on the basis of previous studies carried out on twins in Scandinavia (this difference could be explained, according to Kaare Christensen (Director of the Danish Twin Registry in Odense), by Scandinavia's history and peaceful environment, which may have given genetics a more important role than the world average).\n\n\n== Semiology of the term \"life expectancy\" ==\nThis expression is polysemous and can refer to:\n\nHuman (or animal) life expectancy, with no indication of age, is generally life expectancy at age zero (birth, onset of function, etc.). We may also refer to life expectancy after the onset of a serious illness, or after surgery or chemotherapy. In the latter cases, we can also refer to \"life expectancy at five years\", in other words in the years following the first five years after;\nlife expectancy in good health (Eurostat statistics) anddisability-corrected life expectancy (WHO statistics);\nthe life expectancy of a population of objects subjected to given stresses (shear, thermal, mechanical, etc.).\nHowever, it does not reflect \"potential longevity\", defined as the maximum lifespan that a living creature of a given species, an object, a machine, etc., is expected to reach.\nIn statistics, \"expectancy\" is a neutral mathematical term (equally applicable to desirable and undesirable events) denoting an average.\n\n\n== Mean or median ==\nIn some cases, \"service life\", or \"mean running time\", is calculated as a median rather than a mean.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of countries by life expectancy\nLongevity\nPlanned obsolescence\nLife\nHalf-life\nHealth\nSustainable development\nForce of mortality",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Vita Haroldi (English: Life of Harold) is an anonymous Latin work, written around the year 1205, which claims to relate the life of king Harold Godwinson.  It asserts that Harold was not killed at the Battle of Hastings but survived for many years, first journeying on the continent of Europe and then living as a hermit in various parts of England and Wales.  It survives in only one manuscript, copied in Waltham Abbey, and it may have been composed there.  Harold was certainly a patron of Waltham Abbey and was in all likelihood buried there.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn the Prologue, the writer accepts from his ecclesiastical sponsors the commission to write about Harold, a devotee, like them, of the Holy Cross.  The Vita proper begins with some account of Harold's father, Earl Godwin, in particular detailing a mission to Denmark in which he escapes a treacherous attempt to kill him and marries the King of Denmark's sister.  It then moves on to Harold and his Welsh wars, in the course of which he contracts a paralytic illness which baffles doctors.  He is miraculously healed by the Holy Cross of Waltham, gratefully builds a new church there to house it, and endows it with many treasures.  It is later refounded by Henry II.  Harold is raised by God to the throne of England and defeats Norwegian invaders, but is struck down by his Norman enemies.  The writer of the Vita names his authority for much of the foregoing as Sebricht, a former servant of Harold who subsequently became a most holy pilgrim and hermit.\nHarold is left for dead by the Normans, but is healed by a Saracen woman in Winchester as he lies concealed there for two years.  He then visits Saxony and Denmark, but finds no help for his cause.  Seeing at last that God has turned against him, he adopts a life of humility and devotion and becomes a pilgrim, just as he had in former days, before he ascended the throne, made a perilous pilgrimage to Rome.  The writer praises Harold's piety, then discusses the oath Harold swore to support William of Normandy's claim to the English throne.  Some condemn him as a perjurer, citing the fact that God stripped the oak under which he swore the oath of all its bark.  Others, including the writer, justify his perjury on the grounds that his oath was given under duress and that complying with it would have been disastrous for the English people.  God, the writer argues at length, showed his approval of Harold's decision by this same miracle, by giving him victory over the Norwegians, and by another miracle in which the figure of Christ on the Holy Cross bowed to him.\nReturning home after many years abroad, Harold adopts the name of Christian, becomes a hermit in a cave near Dover and lives there for ten years.  Then he journeys to Wales and lives incognito there, tormented by the brutal natives but returning good for evil until he has won them over.  In his old age he moves to a hermitage at St John's Church in Chester, still concealing his identity.\nHere the writer breaks off to consider other accounts of Harold's end, censuring William of Malmesbury for writing that he had died at the Battle of Hastings, but commending Aelred of Rievaulx for allowing the possibility that he survived it.  Waltham Abbey's claim that Harold was buried there is mistaken, another body on the battlefield at Hastings having been misidentified as Harold's.  This fact was confirmed by Harold's brother, Gyrth, when he met the Abbot of Waltham during the reign of Henry II.  The writer takes issue with his source, a hermit, as to the motives of Harold's actions, before quoting at length that hermit's account of Harold's life after the Battle of Hastings, which recapitulates the events summarised above.\nThe writer ends with a brief account of Harold's last days, during which he reveals his real identity to his confessor and at last dies.\n\n\n== Manuscript ==\nThe Vita Haroldi survives in a single manuscript, British Library Harley MS 3776, which was copied some time between 1345 and c. 1370 by a scribe apparently little acquainted with Latin.  The Vita forms the first article in this manuscript, being followed immediately by the De Inventione Crucis de Waltham [On the Finding of the Cross of Waltham] and then by several other works, some relating to Waltham Abbey and its Holy Cross.\nThe manuscript was kept at Waltham Abbey until its dissolution in 1540.  It then came into the hands of the Dukes of Norfolk, being kept by them at Naworth Castle.  In 1720 it was in the possession of the antiquary and herald John Warburton, and was sold by him then to Humfrey Wanley, librarian to Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, whose collection was later sold to the British Museum.\n\n\n== Date and authorship ==\nThe Vita Haroldi is believed to have been written around the year 1205.  The name of the its author is not known.  It has been surmised that he was a canon at Waltham Abbey; or, since it contradicts that abbey's claim to have the grave of Harold, a canon who had been expelled from it; or perhaps someone associated with Chester rather than Waltham.  A suggestion that he was the hagiographer Jocelyn of Furness has not found favour.\n\n\n== Themes and genre ==\nThe Vita Haroldi has since the 19th century been dismissed by historians as a mere romance, and indeed it does have features in common with the chivalric romances of the time, dealing as it does with the adventures of a swashbuckling warrior favoured by God.  But it also has all of the typical characteristics of a saint's life apart from a list of his miracles and a specified burial site.  His life is shown as being Christlike in that he endures injury and humiliation from lesser people and transcends these sufferings to reach final redemption.\n\n\n== Analogues ==\nThe whole of the Vita Haroldi’s account of its hero's life after Hastings is universally agreed to be fictional, but it was not all invented by the Vita’s author.  Medieval legends of English and British kings surviving their supposed deaths are not uncommon, Edward II, Richard II, and of course King Arthur being examples.  In Harold's case, two 12th-century works, Aelred of Rievaulx's Life of St Edward (c. 1163) and Gerald of Wales's Journey Through Wales (1191), report rumours of his survival, Gerald specifying that he is supposed to have ended as an anchorite in Chester.  After the Vita Haroldi was written similar stories appeared in the works of Gervase of Tilbury, Ralph of Coggeshall (who reports that Harold was still alive in 1189!), Ranulf Higden, John Brompton, and Henry Knighton.  It is also referred to in at least two Icelandic works, Játvarðar Saga and Hemings þáttr Áslákssonar.\nSimilarities have been detected between the Vita Haroldi and works in which Harold does not figure.  One Latin version of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar gives an account of the supposed life of its hero, Olaf Tryggvason, after the Battle of Svolder which has many points of resemblance with the Vita, but it is not clear whether the saga's author, Oddr Snorrason, drew on the Vita or on traditional lore which could perhaps also have influenced the Vita.  One episode in the Vita tells how Harold's father, Godwin, is sent by king Canute to Denmark bearing messages which, when Godwin reads them en route, prove to be instructions to their Danish addressees to kill him; Godwin rewrites them to the effect that he should be welcomed and given the king's sister in marriage, and this ruse succeeds.  There are very similar stories to this one in the early 13th-century Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus (and in Shakespeare's Hamlet, which drew on Saxo), in Hemings þáttr Áslákssonar, and in a number of Classical and Eastern sources.  There are more general parallels with the Middle English poem Sir Orfeo, which also deals with a king's prolonged exile in his own former kingdom after a dreadful personal loss.  Also with the Anglo-Norman romances of Gui de Warewic, the story of an English warrior who becomes first a pilgrim and then a hermit, and Boeve de Haumtone, which features a Saracen woman aiding another English knight.  Among English hagiographies, Reginald of Durham's Vita et miracula Sancti Godrici and John of Ford's Vita Wulfrici anchoretae Haselbergiae have been singled out as showing particular similarities to the Vita Haroldi.  All three concentrate not so much on the moment of conversion as on the progressive deepening of religious conviction; they also all feature the wearing of armour for penitential reasons.\nThe Vita Haroldi was the inspiration for at least one modern work of literature, Rudyard Kipling's tale \"The Tree of Justice\", collected in his Rewards and Fairies (1910).   Harold, a supposedly \"witless man\" constantly on pilgrimage in England, is discovered by Henry I's jester, Rahere, and brought before the king.  He dies at the moment his identity is recognised and his royal status honoured by king and courtiers.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nMichel, Francisque (1836). Chroniques anglo-normandes.

        "content": "Ephraim \"Efi\" Nave (born 15 December 1968) is an Israeli lawyer who served as chairman of the Israel Bar Association between 2015 and 2019. He previously served as chairman of the Bar Association's Ethics Committee in the Central Israel district, as well as the district's chair.\nOn 13 June 2017, Nave was elected to serve on the Judicial Selection Committee by the Bar Association. He served between January and December 2018, when he resigned after being indicted for illegally smuggling a female acquaintance out of the country. Nave was convicted of the crime in September 2022.\nOn 16 January 2019, Nave was arrested and investigated for allegedly receiving sexual bribes in exchange for a judicial appointment. Following the arrest, Nave resigned as chairman of the Israel Bar Association. On 21 March 2021, Israel's Deputy State Attorney decided not to indict Nave over the scandal.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEfi Nave was born in Ashkelon to Iraqi Jewish parents. In 1987, Nave enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces, serving in the Armored Corps. Nave was reassigned to Mamram after experiencing a road accident.\nIn 2006, Nave became chairman of the ethics committee of the Israel Bar Association's Tel Aviv and Central Israel district. In June 2011, Nave was elected the district's chairman.\n\n\n=== Chairman of the Israel Bar Association ===\nIn June 2015, Nave was elected Chairman of the Israel Bar Association, defeating the incumbent Doron Barzilay and lawyer Tally Gotliv.\nIn January 2017, Nave sued journalist Sharon Sphurer for defamation after she published articles alleging that Nave gave preferential treatment to his allies and former donors while choosing lawyers for arbitration cases that were referred to the Bar Association. The court ruled in Sphurer's favor in September 2019 and ordered Nave to pay Sphurer NIS 70,000.\nNave resigned as chairman in January 2019 and was replaced by Avi Himi. In June 2023, Nave ran for another term as chairman. He received 19% of the vote, losing to Amit Becher.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Criminal convictions ===\nIn 2018, Israeli police launched a criminal investigation against Nave on suspicions that he committed Fraud and smuggled a female acquaintance, Bar Katz, through Israeli border control. Nave confessed to the crime during an investigation, and was indicted alongside Katz on 25 December. That day, he announced his intention to resign from Israel's Judicial Selection Committee, of which he had been a member. Nave claimed the indictment was politically motivated, and stemmed from his opposition to the appointment of State Attorney Shai Nitzan.\nIn September 2022, Nave and Katz were convicted of Fraud and Illegal entry and departure, and in November, Nave was sentenced to two months of probation and an NIS 2,000 fine. The Central Israel District Court denied an appeal by both Katz and Nave.\n\n\n=== Corruption charges ===\nIn January 2019, Nave was arrested on suspicions of accepting sexual bribes in exchange for Judicial Appointments. In December 2019, Nave and judge Eti Kraif were indicted on charges of bribery by the State Attorney.\nFollowing his arrest, Nave filed a complaint with Israeli police for breach of privacy after it was discovered that the investigation started from evidence taken from a cellphone belonging to Nave, which was acquired by Army Radio journalist Hadas Shtief and unlocked with the help of a private investigator. Nave additionally sued Army Radio and Shtief for NIS 7 Million for the breach. In May, he requested an additional NIS 141,000 in compensation from Shtief for defamation, alleging she used derogatory language in her stories on Nave, including referring to him as a \"Garbage worm\".\nOn 21 March 2021, Israel's Deputy State Attorney decided to avoid indicting Nave over the scandal, stating that the evidence acquired by Shtief was acquired improperly and was therefore inadmissible in court.\nIn March 2024, Haaretz published recordings of Nave in which he agreed to support Eitan Orenstein's bid for the Presidency of a District Court in exchange for judicial favors and appointments. In April, additional recordings surfaced in which then Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked agreed to promote Orenstein's appointment in exchange for favors from Nave.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNave is married, resides in Tel Aviv and has eight children, two from his current wife and six from the previous.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Avadai Dhanam Lakshimi (1925 – April 18, 2005) was a Singaporean former politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) representing Moulmein SMC from 1963 to 1953 and the 3rd Spouse of the President of Singapore from 1981 to 1985.\nDhanam became the first female MP of Indian origin, when she was elected as the MP for Moulmein SMC in 1963. In her role as an MP she was known for her public health advocacy.\nServing in the role for 5 years, she retired in 1968, continuing to serve in the public service. She married Devan Nair in August 1953, who later became the President of Singapore.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in 1925, Dhanam was a fourth-generation Singaporean, the daughter of a contractor, both her parents died before she was 11. She was brought up by her mother's brother and her maternal grandmother along with her five siblings. Her grandmother later died during the Japanese Occupation.\nDue to her family's poverty, she was only educated up to primary three.\nDuring World War II, she took up sewing and farming to support her family.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nDhanam met her husband during childhood at Rangoon Road School. Her husband, then an anti-colonial protestor, was detained in prison from 1951 to 1953. Upon his release, they married in August 1953. During that period, she gave birth to two children, including journalist, Janadas Devan. During her husband's second political detention, from 1956 to 1959, she raised her children and managed her family by herself.\nDuring her political career, she and her husband served as Members of Parliament (MP) in two different countries, with Devan Nair serving as the People Action Party's sole MP in the Malaysian Parliament for Bungsar Constituency until 1969.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Member of Parliament (1963–1968) ===\nDhanam was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Moulmein SMC in 1963, representing the People's Action Party. She became an MP to stand for her husband as he had not gotten Singaporean citizenship yet. During her tenure, she was known for her advocacy in Singapore's Public Health Service, launching an X-Ray campaign in her constituency, in order to combat tuberculosis. She stepped down from Parliament in 1968.\n\n\n=== Public life ===\nAfter her retirement from the Public Office, Dhanam continued to keep a public profile, representing her husband at public events.\n\n\n=== First Lady of Singapore ===\nAfter her husband was elected as president in 1981, she became the 3rd First Lady of Singapore, continuing to advocate for health related causes, supporting organisations such as the Singapore Red Cross Society.\nShe served in this position until her husband's unexpected resignation in 1985.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter his resignation, Dhanam and her husband migrated first to the United States in 1988 where they settled in Gaithersburg, Maryland. They later moved to Bloomington, Indiana. The couple later moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where they lived for the rest of their lives. She died on 18 April 2005, in Hamilton, from pneumonia, 8 months before her husband.\n\n\n== References ==",

They are part of universities and are associated with one of France's 29 university hospital centers (CHU). But they are traditionally called \"Facultés de médecine\". They are responsible for training students for the medical profession or for other medical professions (midwifery) or paramedical professions (speech therapist, orthoptist, occupational therapist, etc.). \nWith the Faure Law of 1968, medical faculties became part of a university. They ceased to exist as legal entities, becoming teaching and research units, then training and research units in 1984.\n\n\n== Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes ==\n\n\n== Bourgogne-Franche-Comté ==\n\n\n== Brittany ==\n\n\n== Centre-Val de Loire ==\n\n\n== Grand Est ==\n\n\n== Hauts-de-France ==\n\n\n== Île-de-France – Paris region ==\n\n\n== Nouvelle-Aquitaine ==\n\n\n== Normandy ==\n\n\n== Occitanie ==\n\n\n== Pays de la Loire ==\n\n\n== Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nListe des facultés de médecine - Conseil national de l'Ordre des médecins\nWorld Directory of Medical Schools",

        "content": "Borea (\"Boreas\") was an Italian Nembo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1903, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign until she was sunk in 1917 during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\nBorea was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, on 2 October 1899. She was launched on 12 December 1902 and completed on 6 October 1903. She was commissioned in 1903.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Borea′s took place in 1910. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. Sometime between 1914 and 1917, Borea underwent additional modifications in which minelaying equipment was installed aboard her.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. Nembo was assigned at the time to the 2nd Squadron's 4th Division along with her sister ships Aquilone, Nembo, and Turbine when the war broke out. On 12 July 1912 she deployed to the Aegean Sea, where at 04:00 on 14 July 1912, she got underway from Stampalia in the Dodecanese with Borea and the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani to provide support to the torpedo boats Astore, Centauro, Climene, Perseo, and Spica as they conducted a reconnaissance of the Dardanelles. The ships first steamed to the Italian-occupied island of Leros in the southern Aegean Sea, where the torpedo boats were prepared for the incursion. They then proceeded to Strati (also known as Bozaba), where they arrived on 17 July 1912 and the officer who would command the torpedo boats during the operation joined the force. Delayed by bad weather, the force left Strati on the afternoon of 18 July bound for the Dardanelles. While Borea, Vettor Pisani, and Nembo remained off the coast out of sight of land, the torpedo boats penetrated the Dardanelles, noting the location of Ottoman ships and the defenses of the strait. Suffering only slight damage and no casualties, the torpedo boats returned to Vettor Pisani during the predawn hours of 19 July 1912. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Borea, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Pontremoli, as well as Aquilone, Nembo, Turbine, and their sister ship Espero made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto. On the night of 23–24 May 1915, the first night of Italy's participation in the war, Borea towed the submarine Nereide across the Adriatic Sea to the coast of Austria-Hungary so that Nereide could lay in ambush off the major Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Cattaro.  \nOn the afternoon of 6 December 1915 Borea, now under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Arese, the protected cruiser Quarto, the scout cruiser Guglielmo Pepe, the auxiliary cruiser Città di Catania, the minelayers Minerva and Partenope, and the destroyers Francesco Nullo, Giuseppe Cesare Abba, and Ippolito Nievo got underway from Taranto to escort a convoy consisting of the troopships America, Cordova, Dante Alighieri, and Indiana and the military transport Benghazi carrying 400 officers, 6,300 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, and 1,200 horses from Italy to Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in the Principality of Albania. The convoy reached Vlorë at 08:00 on 7 December 1915.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\nIn October 1916 Borea, Nembo, the destroyers Ascaro and Garibaldino, and four torpedo boats provided protection and support to a landing force consisting of the armored cruiser Francesco Ferruccio and the steamers Ausonia, Bulgaria, Choising, and Polcevera sent to occupy Sarandë (known to the Italians as Santi Quaranta), in Albania. At 05:15 on 2 October 1916, four platoons of sailors, a unit of miners, and a unit of personnel from Francesco Ferruccio landed on the beach and quickly occupied the area, the 32 members of the Greek garrison at Sarandë having no option other than to retreat after protesting the Italian operation. After disembarking an infantry battalion and a cavalry squadron, the steamers departed at 16:00 on 2 October for Vlorë, where they embarked more troops. On 3 October, Ausonia and Polcevera landed a pack artillery battery and a second cavalry squadron, and on 4 October the operation was completed when Bulgaria and Choising put another infantry battalion and a third cavalry squadron ashore.  \n\n\n==== Battle of the Strait of Otranto ====\nAt 10:00 on 14 May 1917 Borea departed Gallipoli to escort a convoy made up of the steamships Bersagliere, Carroccio, and Verità to Vlorë. At around 03:30 on 15 May, shortly after the convoy turned to a heading of 310 degrees to proceed toward Vlorë, Borea sighted two unidentified destroyers. The ships Borea sighted were the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Balaton and Csepel, which had been sent to attack Allied convoys as a diversionary action in support of an Austro-Hungarian Navy attack by the light cruisers Helgoland, Novara, and Saida on the Otranto Barrage, an antisubmarine barrier in the Strait of Otranto. Balation and Csepel had sighted the Italian convoy at 03:06 Austrian time (which differed from Italian time), and were steering to attack it. After closing the range to around 1,000 metres (1,100 yd), Borea, still uncertain about the identity of the two ships, made recognition signals. In response Csepel opened gunfire. Borea maneuvered to make a torpedo attack against Csepel, but Csepel scored a hit that burst one of Borea′s steam pipes, immobilizing her. Csepel then hit Borea with two shells which struck near her waterline, and Borea began to list. Borea then took a shell hit on her bow. In the meantime, Balaton attacked the merchant ships of the convoy. Carroccio and Verità caught fire and their crews abandoned ship; Carroccio sank later, but Verità remained afloat and eventually reached port. Bersagliere suffered only slight damage and escaped.\nThe clash, a part of the larger Battle of the Strait of Otranto, the largest naval action of the Adriatic Campaign of World War I, ended at 03:45 when the two Austro-Hungarian ships withdrew. Borea′s crew abandoned ship, and she sank 05:20 on 15 May 1917. Her crew suffered 11 men killed and 12 wounded.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W. H.

        "content": "James W. Bell (1841/1853-28 April 1881), also referred to as \"Long\" Bell, \"Lone\" Bell or Jim Long, was a Deputy Sheriff of the United States Marshals Service. He was shot and killed by Billy the Kid during his escape from Lincoln County jail on 28 April 1881.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBell was born in Georgia in 1853 with both father from Virginia, but some historians claimed he was born in Maryland in 1841. He was a miner and Texas Ranger. It is also claimed he was a private in Company D., Frontier Battalion, of Captain Dan W. Roberts, but according to Bill Reynolds he was Joseph William Bell, who was born on 17 May 1849 in Ohio.\nOn 13 December 1873 he enlisted as private in G. W. Campbell's Montague County Rangers and was discharged on 13 February 1877. In the spring of 1879 Oscar W. Williams, Bell's mining companion, organized a mining party from Dallas, Texas to New Mexico and Leadville, Colorado, and included Bell to take part in mining ventures. They travelled northwest across Staked Plains and arrived on 5 July 1879 at Tascosa, a small settlement in the Texas Panhandle. There were a strike twenty-four miles south of Santa Fe, in Carbonateville, near present-day Cerrillos, New Mexico, and when they arrived there, they were disbanded.\nWilliams and Bell remained together there and they set up camps, staked out some mining properties and made forays. White Oaks offered better promise and Bell drifted alone and arrived in 1880, being actively engaged in mining activities in Nogal and Jicarilla Mountains, where he had a fine prospect alongside R. D. Lypard.\nOn the evening of 22 November 1880 someone tried to steal his horses, and the next day he rode with a posse headed by Deputy Sheriff Will Hudgens to Blake's sawmill, gang's camp, near town, but it was deserted. They trailed the gang to Coyote Springs where several horses but no men were killed after a gunfight. They scaped and posse returned to White Oaks. At that night the gang rode into White Oaks and shot Jim Redman in front of Will Hudgens saloon, and in response Jimmy Carlyle and Bell shot but failed. Bell and Carlyle trailed Billy the Kid, Billy Wilson and Dave Rudabaugh forty miles north to Jim Greathouse-Fred Kuch ranch, also called Greathouse ranch or tavern, where Carlyle was killed.\nIn 1881 he became one of Pat Garrett's deputy sheriffs in Lincoln County, and they became friends. He later was titled as United States Deputy Marshall, but no mention was found in United States Marshall archives, so he may have been employed on an \"as-needed\" service. On 15 December 1881 Pat Garrett and his pose headed to Puerto de Luna in pursuit of Billy the Kid hideout. Leaving Alexander Grzelachowski ranch, they followed them to Los Ojitos, Fort Sumner, where Tom O'Folliard was shot and killed, to Wilcox and Brazil ranch, the edge of the Llano Estacado, and finally to a rock hut in Stinking Springs, where they surrendered the next morning.\nBell joined the contingent as Garrett guard and they sett of toward Las Vegas. On 26 December 1881 he helped load the prisoners aboard a wagon, where a large angry crowd was waiting, and while the posse were waiting to start the trip to Santa Fe, they gathered and intended to snatch Rudabaugh, who previously killed Las Vegas jailer during his scape.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSubsequently, Billy the Kid was sentenced to hang for the murder of Sheriff William Brady at Old Mesilla, and he was brought back to Lincoln. Bell and Robert Olinger were assigned as jailers and to guard him. Billy found a previously hidden revolver under the toilet seat or he wrested from Bell when they backed up the stairs to walk down, and on 28 April 1881 he shot Bell twice and killed him. Bell ran into Gottfried George Gauss, caretaker of the courthouse at that time, and expired the same moment.\nGeorge Washington Mitchell was appointed administrator of pitifully small Bell's state and property, which consisted of 7.75 dollars owed to I. N. Bell and 2.20 to J. Tomlinson.\nBodies of Olinger and Bell were sent to Fort Stanton, where Olinger was buried in the cemetery there, but it is uncertain where Bell was buried. He was sent to White Oaks, where his family lived, or Lincoln. In any case, on 19 July 2003 the White Oaks Cemetery Association, headed by Bessie Leslie, and cooperated by New Mexico Sheriffs' and Police Association, erected a monument to Bell. They chose Cedarvale Cemetery, White Oaks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGarrett, Patrick Floyd; Nolan, Frederick W. (2000). The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid.

        "content": "Thomas John Bateman (30 December 1908 – 4 February 1993) was a motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBateman, born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, was a well known grasstrack rider before moving into conventional speedway. He began his British leagues career riding for Nottingham during the 1937 Provincial Speedway League and helped the team win the league title. Later that season he travelled to Australia to race.\nHe was coveted after an impressive first season by various clubs, including Wimbledon, Norwich and Belle Vue. He eventually signed for Hackney Wick Wolves, which turned out to be fortunate because he won the league title again.\nBateman started riding for Middlesbrough in the top division during 1939 before they withdrew from the league after just eight matches. He found consolation with the Belle Vue reserve team but the season was cut short by World War II.\nAfter the war, Bateman joined the Sheffield Tigers recording a solid 8.00 season average and helping Sheffield into second place. The team won the British Speedway Cup in 1947, with Bateman improving his average to 9.11.\nBateman's last season was the 1950 Speedway National League Division Two, when he moved to ride for the Newcastle Diamonds averaging an impressive 9.67.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kaba Rougui Barry (23 September 1953 - 13 March 2016) was a Guinean politician and entrepreneur.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBarry was born on 23 September 1953 in Mamou to the local noble family. She is the second child of 10 siblings. She then moved to Conakry in an unknown year and attended primary education at school in the Coléah neighborhood of Conakry from 1962 to 1968. Afterward, she enrolled at CER de Coléah and received the Certificate of Secondary Education (BEPC) with honors in 1972. She then studied at Lycée 02 octobre and earned a Baccalauréat certificate in Mathematics and Physics in 1975.\nBarry continued her higher education by taking a pre-training course in civil engineering. After that, she enrolled at Paris-Panthéon-Assas University and earned a degree in economics in 1981.\n\n\n== Entrepreneurial career ==\nShe began her career as a businesswoman. In 1986, she became the first female coffee exporter in Guinea. Her entrepreneurial career continued while she served as the Mayor of Matam. In 1993, she founded a battery manufacturing plant that employed 400 workers.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Mayor of Matam ===\nIn 1990, Barry decided to run for the Matam mayoral election after being persuaded by a group of young people. She was elected mayor of Matam in 1991, making her the first female mayor in Guinea. She was re-elected in 1996. However, Lansana Conté did not endorse Barry and prevented her from being inaugurated as a mayor for seven months. In 2000, she joined the opposition party, URF, after the passing of a regulation stipulated that mayoral candidates had to become members of a political party. Nevertheless, she could not participate in the 2000 Matam Mayor Election after Lansana Conté invalidated her mayoral candidacy for being part of the opposition.\nUnder her tenure, she constructed footbridges overlooking the Fidel Castro highway. Apart from that, she encouraged women to take jobs in dyeing and soap making and created a framework that allowed the jobless youth to encounter business leaders. While serving as mayor, she also joined the African Managers Club from 1991 to 2000.\n\n\n=== Post-mayoral era (2000-2009) ===\nUpon stepping down as mayor in 2000, Barry moved to Saint-Denis and worked as a trader by erecting her business company. She also got involved in several humanitarian actions. She founded NGOs that provided jobs to the youth. She became the leader of the NGO Aid for Sustainable Development (ADD) in 2006. On 29 March 2004, Barry was arrested and put into detention for 44 days under the accusation of conspiracy to overthrow the government. During the detention, she went on a nine-day hunger strike to protest the injustice. Previously, she was banned from leaving the country when she boarded a plane to Paris on 24 March. She announced her candidacy for the commune election in 2005. Nevertheless, the government rejected it. \n\n\n=== Political career (2019-2016) ===\nIn January 2009, Moussa Dadis Camara appointed Barry as the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Transport for two days, then promoted to Minister of Pre-University, Technical, Vocational Education, and Civic Education, replacing Aisha Bah. Barry was requested to participate in the preparation for the 2010 Guinean presidential election on 8 March 2010. She announced her presidential candidacy from the Guinean Party for Renaissance and Progress for the 2010 presidential election. She was then appointed the National Coordinator of the RPG leader election in November 2010. \nCondé assigned Barry as the minister delegate for Guineans Abroad on 30 December 2010. Guinean deportees from Libya who had arrived in the country accused Barry of embezzling the Saudi and Belgium-funded integration assistance of $300,000 as the fund never reached them. Apart from that, a computer merchant named Moussa Diallo denounced Barry for not paying the debt of computers and laptops that she purchased for the Ministry of Guineans abroad office equipment. However, she denied that the ministry purchased the computer with Moussa Diallo but with Joly Decor company instead, and she claimed that the ministry had paid the purchase to the company.\nIn 2014, she stepped down from the ministerial position when she was designated as the president's advisor on 4 February. Conakry faced violence during the 2015 Guinean presidential election campaign and she called the Guineans to \" remain calm and show restraint.\"\n\n\n== Death ==\nBarry died in Morocco on 13 March 2016 due to an illness. Her body was flown to Guinea, and the funeral was held on 18 April 2016. She is buried in Cameroon Cemetery, Conakry.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBarry belongs to Fulani and she was a Muslim. She got married in 1988 to the deputy director of customs in Conakry, Mamady Kaba and had five children. \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2018, a foundation named after Barry was founded, MME Kaba Rougui Barry & Babies Foundation aiming to assist the poor and needy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1984 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1984 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1983–84 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Tennessee Lady Volunteers and the USC Trojans. The game was played on April 1, 1984, at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California. After trailing by two points at halftime, No. 5 USC defeated No. 15 Tennessee 72–61 to capture back-to-back NCAA national championships. USC's Cheryl Miller was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player once again.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Tennessee Lady Volunteers ===\n\nThe Lady Volunteers, who represented the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, were led by head coach Pat Summitt, in her 10th season at the school. Tennessee opened the season ranked No. 5 in the AP poll. Playing one of the toughest schedules in the country, a program trademark, the Lady Volunteers saw their ranking slowing decline through the season and landed at No. 15 in the final poll.\nIn the NCAA tournament, Tennessee defeated Middle Tennessee State, Alabama, and No. 3 Georgia to reach their second NCAA Final Four in three seasons. They won 82–73 over No. 9 Cheyney State in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game with a 23–9 record.\n\n\n=== USC Trojans ===\n\nThe Trojans, represented the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, were led by head coach Linda Sharp in her 7th season at the school. They began last season's title defense ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll, a spot they would hold for the first seven rankings. After losing three games in a 5-day span, to No. 6 Texas, No. 2 Louisiana Tech, and No. 7 Old Dominion, the team fell to No. 5. USC would peak at the No. 3 spot for five straight weeks before falling back to No. 5 – after a loss to No. 6 Long Beach State – for the final two polls of the season.\nUSC was the top seed in the West region of the NCAA tournament and defeated BYU, Montana, and Long Beach State to reach their second straight Final Four. In a rematch of the 1983 National championship game, the Trojans avenged a midseason loss and defeated No. 2 Louisiana Tech, 62–57, to move to 28–4 and set up the championship game matchup with the Lady Vols.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johnny Carter is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders and he is played by Charlie Suff. Johnny makes his first appearance in episode 4771, originally broadcast on 26 December 2013. Johnny has been played by three actors since being introduced in 2013. Sam Strike first portrayed the role from 2013 until he exited in 2014, his final appearance on 25 December 2014 via a Skype call on Christmas Day. In February 2016, it was announced that Johnny would return, played by Ted Reilly who made his first appearance on 11 April 2016. Reilly announced his departure from the role in December 2017, making his final on-screen appearance on 29 January 2018. In December 2023, it was announced that the character would be returning, played by Charlie Suff. Johnny returned on 9 February 2024.\nJohnny's storylines have included coming out as homosexual which his mother Linda (Kellie Bright) initially struggles to accept, his relationship with Gianluca Cavallo (Gabriele Lombardo), supporting Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) after his boyfriend Paul Coker is murdered in a homophobic attack, being injured in a robbery at the Queen Vic and discovering that his brother Lee (Danny Hatchard) was responsible, being shot by Ted Murray (Christopher Timothy), helping his mother and her friends with the cover-up of the murder of Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters).\n\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2014 ===\nJohnny makes his first appearance on 26 December 2013, moving into The Queen Victoria public house with parents, Mick (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). He soon meets Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), and his parents tease him about being attractive to women. However, after Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy) compliments Johnny on his looks, Johnny asks if he meant it, leading to them kissing, which his grandmother Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) witnesses.\nJohnny lets his parents assume he kissed Whitney, though Shirley advises him against this. When Johnny's sister Nancy (Maddy Hill) arrives in Walford, she outs Johnny as gay to her family during an argument. Eventually, Johnny breaks down and comes out to Mick after denying his sexuality previously. They are unaware, however, that Linda has overheard their conversation. Linda finds it extremely difficult to come to terms with Johnny's sexuality, which leads to numerous arguments with Mick and Shirley. Johnny eventually reveals his sexuality to Whitney, who is hurt as she feels that Johnny has been using her. She soon forgives Johnny and even offers for him to move in with her and her family if his relationship with Linda does not improve. Johnny later threatens to leave The Queen Vic, so Mick forces Linda to sort things out. Linda seems to have finally come round to the idea of Johnny being gay, but she later breaks down over the situation. Johnny realises that Linda is not fully accepting of his sexuality when she invites Whitney, who she thinks is pregnant, over and tries to set them up, Johnny feels hurt and betrayed and a huge argument ensues. Mick then tells Linda to fully accept his sexuality or risk losing him forever. Whitney tells Johnny that he needs to get a boyfriend so that everyone can accept it and move on with their lives. \nJohnny manages to secure a job as a barman in Sharon Rickman's (Letitia Dean) new bar, The Albert. When Sharon is attacked by two masked intruders, Johnny hides upstairs and later phones for help. His family assumes he scared the intruders away but Johnny is forced to admit he hid upstairs and did nothing. Johnny fails some of his exams and Linda interferes by going to see his tutor behind his back. Furious, Johnny rows with his mother, calling her a \"stupid bitch\", and decides to leave Walford, ashamed of what he said. Johnny's great-grandfather Stan Carter (Timothy West) takes Linda and Nancy to see him at Stan's unoccupied flat. Johnny and Linda apologise and Linda gives him her blessing to attend Pride London, where he meets Gianluca Cavallo (Gabriele Lombardo). He tells his siblings he has met someone, and Lee encourages him to invite Gianluca to Linda's birthday party. Johnny loses his virginity to Gianluca, and after the party, Linda tells Johnny she approves of Gianluca and he is welcome to come back.\nJohnny shows brief interest in Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) when he is released from prison. Ben has told his father Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that his homosexuality was a phase, but confuses Johnny by flirting with him at times and rejecting him at others. Johnny realises that Ben is desperate to prove himself and criticises him for dating Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), but Ben continues to deny that he is gay. Ben later tries to kiss Johnny, but he rebukes him. Johnny announces that he is going to go travelling with Gianluca. Initially, Linda finds this hard to accept, but she soon relents, and Johnny leaves with her blessing, after telling Ben to stop denying who he is.\n\n\n=== 2016–2018 ===\nJohnny (now played by Ted Reilly) returns amid a family crisis in April 2016. He avoids talking about Gianluca and realises Linda is hiding something from him. During a heart-to-heart talk, he admits he and Gianluca have split up, and Linda tells him she was raped by his uncle Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Johnny cannot deal with everything that has happened to the family since he left, and tells Mick he blames him for it all. He apologises the next day and persuades Mick to stop blaming Nancy for the accident that has left their brother Ollie Carter with possible brain damage. Johnny decides to not return to Italy and convinces his university tutor to let him take his second year exam. His tutor reluctantly accepts; Johnny takes and passes his exams.\nWhen Ben's boyfriend Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) is murdered in a homophobic attack, Johnny supports Ben and encourages him to tell the police that the crime was motivated by homophobia. Linda worries Johnny is developing feelings for Ben, but he insists he is merely being a good friend. In November Ben, still grieving and feeling rejected by his father, gets drunk and tries to kiss Johnny, but Johnny refuses to take advantage of his vulnerable state.\nWith Lee due to marry Johnny's close friend Whitney, Johnny discovers Lee has got into debt with a payday loan company. He encourages his brother to come clean, but Lee forces himself to go ahead with the wedding. The Carters then later become victims of a burglary. Johnny attempts to fend off the robbers but is injured in the process, after one of them attacks him with a baseball bat. It is later revealed that Lee was responsible for the burglary and a result Johnny becomes hostile towards him.\nAfter Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) move to their own flat, Johnny attends Ben's their housewarming party, which is also Ben's 21st birthday party. After Abi and Jay both try to set them up, they have a one-night stand after getting drunk.

Soon after this, he forms a friendship with older gay neighbour Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender), after Derek berates Johnny for standing idly by during a homophobic incident. Johnny learns that Derek has a criminal conviction due to having a 20 year old boyfriend when the gay age of consent was still 21. Johnny encourages Derek not to leave the Square after his past incarceration is discovered. Following a gas explosion in the Square, Johnny tries to check on Ted Murray (Christopher Timothy) and his wife Joyce Murray (Maggie Steed), but Ted accidentally shoots Johnny after believing him to be a burglar, although Joyce later takes the blame. The ambulance that Linda and Johnny are travelling in is hit by a truck and falls over, killing the paramedic attending to him. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), who is following in the car behind, manages to get into the ambulance and keep Johnny alive via advice from the ambulance driver until a hospital helicopter arrives. Mick and Linda visit Johnny in hospital where he will make a full recovery. After he is discharged, Johnny writes a letter to the judge in Ted and Joyce's defence, which helps to avoid a conviction.\nThe Carter family are stunned when they discover that they are being evicted from The Queen Vic thanks to Max Branning (Jake Wood). However, they are later offered a chance to keep the pub when they have to pay £150,000 to retain ownership of the pub. In an attempt to raise the cash, Mick joins Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) in a robbery. However, the stolen money goes missing and Mick becomes the prime suspect due to his desperation to save The Queen Vic. Unbeknown to Aidan, the Carters pawn a stolen ring from the robbery and are able to keep The Queen Vic. Johnny is offered a contract with a law firm in Manchester and on the day of his departure, Aidan tries to intimidate him. Johnny lies that the money came from his ancestor's war medals. Using one of Johnny's school history projects, the Carters are able to fool Aidan into thinking that the money is legitimate. Johnny leaves Walford for Manchester in a taxi cab after bidding farewell to Mick and Linda.\n\n\n=== 2024–present ===\nJohnny returns to Walford in February 2024, after his grandmother Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe) contacts him to help Linda who has been drinking heavily. He is furious when Elaine reveals that Dean is back in Walford. Johnny punches Dean and warms him to stay away from Linda. Whilst drinking, Linda later reveals to Johnny that she murdered Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) to protect Sharon, and helped bury his body under the floor of Bridge Street café with Sharon, Kathy Cotton (Gillian Taylforth), Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Suki Panesar (Balvinder Sopal).\n\n\n== Creation and development ==\n\nSam Strike's casting as Johnny was announced on 29 October 2013, on which the actor said: \"I'm really excited to be joining EastEnders and the Carter family. They're all really strong characters and I can't wait to see what EastEnders has planned for us all. I've grown up watching Danny [Dyer] and Kellie [Bright], both of whom are lovely, so to be playing their son is kind of surreal.\" Johnny is described as a 19-year-old \"mummy's boy\". He is the youngest of three siblings, is a university student and is called \"a gentle boy who's happy to let the rest of his family be the centre of attention\", though it was said he has a secret that will \"place him right at the centre of a family storm\". This was the fact that Johnny is gay. \nOn 14 November it was announced that Strike had decided to leave the show as he did not feel that the character was necessary to the current storylines and that he had already filmed his final scenes. His character departed on 23 December 2014 but made a special appearance on 25 December episode.\nIn February 2016, it was announced that the role of Johnny was being recast and the character would return later in the year, but that the casting process was still ongoing at that point. Later on, it was announced that Ted Reilly would be taking over the role. Reilly's first episode was broadcast on 11 April 2016. It was announced on 19 December 2017 that Reilly had finished filming with the show and would depart \"within the next few weeks\". A show spokesperson confirmed the news. Reilly later confirmed that it was his choice to leave the serial and said he would miss his on-screen family. On his departure, the actor commented, \"It was a really tough decision to leave, but at this stage in my career it's very important to keep being challenged & experience new things!\" Reilly made his last appearance on 29 January 2018.\nOn 5 December 2023, it was announced the character would be returning in 2024, with Charlie Suff assuming the role. Johnny's return scenes aired on 9 February 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSam Strike's portrayal of Johnny was met with critical praise, specifically the scenes where Johnny came out to his father, Mick (Danny Dyer). Both Strike's and Dyer's sensitive performances during this scene were praised. with The Guardian's Paul Flynn referring to his coming out as gay to his dad as “an exceptionally moving scene”. \nOn this particular scene, Strike said, \"With that scene where Johnny comes out to Mick, I was really nervous the night it aired, because you want it to look convincing but then you want to do justice by the people that have been there and done it. It was a real proving ground for me, because it was the first time I actually had to do any proper drama acting.\" In an online video on the official website, Strike said, \"I've had letters and Danny's had letters saying that we'd helped people to come out, and it makes things worth it.\" Strike's scenes as Johnny coming out to Mick were later nominated for the Spectacular Scene of the Year Award at the 2014 British Soap Awards and won a Media Recognition Award at the 2014 Attitude Awards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of EastEnders characters (2013)\nList of soap operas with LGBT characters\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lake Grundlsee is situated at the southern foot of the Totes Gebirge in Austria, in the Styrian part of the Salzkammergut. It lies at an altitude of 708 m above sea level. The municipal seat of Grundlsee is located on the northwest shore. The outflow of the Grundlsee is the Grundlsee Traun, which drains into the Danube via the Traun. With an area of 4.22 km2, Grundlsee is the largest lake in Styria. Its location, situated in a beautiful setting, has made it an important tourist destination and a popular bathing lake, as well as a diving and sailing area. The Daffodil Festival, Austria's largest flower festival, occurs every third year at Grundlsee. A professional fisherman manages the lake. The most prevalent fish species is the lake char (Salvelinus umbla), which is marketed as the Lake Aussee lake char.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLake Grundlsee is situated entirely within the municipality of Grundlsee. The settlement center of Grundlsee is located on the northwestern shore. The lake is encircled in a horseshoe shape by the mountains of the Totes Gebirge. A karst plateau begins in the north-west with the Trisselwand (1754 m above sea level), which extends over the rugged Backenstein (1722 m above sea level) to the Reichenstein (1913 m above sea level) and the Siniweler (1907 m above sea level) in the north-east. On the eastern bank is the district of Gößl with the Gößler Wand. To the south, the Ressen (1303 m above sea level) rises. The hilly landscape of the Aussee basin begins in the west.\nThe lake, which extends from west-southwest to east-northeast, has a length of 5.8 km and a maximum width of 917 meters. Its surface area is approximately 4.14 km2, with an average depth of 35 meters. The lake basin exhibits steep slopes, particularly on the northern and southern shores. On the eastern and western shores, shallower areas with gradually increasing depths are observed. The deepest point of the lake is situated approximately in the middle of the lake, with a depth of approximately 62 meters. The total volume of water in the lake is estimated to be 145 million cubic meters.\n\nThe lake can be reached via Grundlseer Straße L703, which runs along the northern shore to the village of Gößl in the east.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\nThe hydrological catchment area of Lake Grundlsee has a total area of 125 km2 and lies entirely within the Totes Gebirge. The lake is primarily fed by the Toplitzbach, which drains the Toplitzsee, and the Stimitzbach. Toplitzbach and Stimitzbach flow into the eastern part of Grundlsee near each other. The village of Gößl is situated on the alluvial cone of the Toplitzbach. The district of Gaiswinkel was constructed on alluvial deposits of the Mühlbach. Like the Zimitzbach stream, the latter created a small, now populated delta into the lake in the vicinity of the district of Schachen. The Grundlsee Traun leaves the lake in the west at the lake lodge, where a bridge crosses the outflow. The discharge is 5.94 m3/s. The theoretical lake retention time is 0.9 years.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\n\n=== Tectonics ===\n\nThe Grundlsee is located on the southwestern edge of the Toten Gebirge formation, which is part of the Northern Limestone Alps. This overlying unit consists mainly of Mesozoic limestones and dolomites of the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basin of Grundlsee lies along a geological disturbance running from west-southwest to east-northeast. This line, known as the Toplitzsee Fault, extends through the Toplitzsee and Kammersee lakes into the Tote Gebirge mountain range. There are remnants of terminal and lateral moraines around the lake. Tressenstein and Plassen limestones dominate the north of the lake, while Hallstätter limestone dominates the south. The eastern part, and thus the main catchment area, is formed by Dachstein Formation. The Haselgebirge mountains also occur on the southern shore near Vienna, where Saint-Gobain Rigips Austria mines the largest gypsum deposit in the Eastern Alps.\n\n\n=== Former glaciation and formation ===\nThe ice-age Grundlsee local glacier, which originated from the high plateau of the Totes Gebirge and flowed into the Aussee basin, also followed the fault-induced zone of weakness. This widened the valley and excavated the tongue basin of Lake Grundlsee. At its western end, the glacier left behind a terminal moraine wall, which is several tens of meters high. This dammed off the lake. The first lake was formed at the edge of the ice body at the same time as the over-deepened basin became ice-free. The high edge of the debris formation around the basin of the Grundlsee indicates this phase with the ice body in the lake basin. The lake area was originally larger and extended from the Toplitz to the Kammersee during the late Würm glacial period. After the final disappearance of the ice, the alluvial cone adjusted to today's lake level. In the post-glacial period, the lake basin underwent constant change due to sedimentation, and it will likely have disappeared again in a few tens of thousands of years.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nThe Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Bad Aussee, situated 3 km away, provides precise data for Lake Grundlsee. The climate data indicates a temperature and precipitation distribution typical of the northern Limestone Alps, characterized by cool summers with high precipitation, with a maximum of 15.6 °C and 208 mm in July, and winters with low precipitation, with a minimum temperature of -2.7 °C in January. Precipitation exhibits a secondary maximum from December to January. The annual precipitation amount was 1566 mm, with an average annual temperature of 7.7 °C. Due to the frequent accumulation of clouds on the edge of the Totes Gebirge, above-average precipitation falls in the area of Lake Grundlsee. A comparison of the annual precipitation in Bad Mitterndorf (803 m above sea level) on the south side of the Totes Gebirge, with a value of 1222 mm, demonstrates the barrier effect of the Totes Gebirge at a similar altitude and a distance of only 10 km. The duration of winter snow cover is approximately 126 days.\n\n\n== Limnology ==\n\n\n=== Circulation ===\n\nLake Grundlsee is a dimictic lake. Following the melting of the ice in spring, the water body undergoes mixing, resulting in the influx of oxygen-rich water into the depths. During the summer months, a thermocline forms, with only the surface layer warming up. This is followed by renewed mixing in the fall, leading to the formation of ice. There are pronounced stratification conditions in Lake Grundlsee. The epilimnion is only approximately five meters thick. The uniformly tempered hypolimnion begins at a depth of 30 meters. Following the spring circulation, the water temperatures at the surface begin to rise, reaching a surface average of 17.5 °C during measurements in August between the years 2000 and 2006. The highest recorded water temperature of 22 °C was observed during the summer of 2003. Below a depth of 30 meters, temperatures average 4.2 °C. Before the onset of the summer stagnation phase, the hypolimnion warms by an average of only 0.1 °C. The lake is covered by a layer of ice on an average of 64 days per year.\n\n\n=== Trophic ===\nThe lake has a low concentration of nutrients, which results in an oligotrophic state. Measurements conducted between the years 2000 and 2006 revealed an average phosphorus content of 5.7 µg/l for Lake Grundlsee. Due to the discharge of untreated wastewater, a trend towards eutrophication was observed in the 1960s, with the oxygen saturation above ground already showing signs of decline. Consequently, remediation measures were implemented, which were concluded in 1980 with the construction of a regional wastewater treatment plant with a third treatment stage in the Bad Aussee municipal area. The oxygen situation improved rapidly, and the oligotrophic state of the lake could be maintained in the long term. Due to the low phytoplankton concentration and low algae growth, the average summer visibility depth is 8.5 meters.\n\n\n=== Plankton ===\nAccording to studies of chlorophyll, the growth of algae in Lake Grundlsee is minimal. The phytoplankton is primarily composed of cryptophyceae and diatoms, with species of the genus Cyclotella being particularly prevalent. Notably, Cyclotella styriaca is a distinctive feature, as this species has thus far been observed exclusively in Lake Altaussee and Lake Grundlsee. In contrast, the zooplankton exhibits significantly greater biomass. Of the rotifers, Kellicottia longispina, Keratella cochlearis, and Keratella hiemalis were frequently observed. The crustacean plankton of Lake Grundlsee is largely composed of the species Eudiaptomus gracilis, Cyclops abyssorum, Daphnia hyalina, and Eubosmina longispina.\n\n\n== Flora and vegetation ==\n\nThe aquatic flora of the lake is particularly diverse due to the alternation of stony and sandy-muddy, richly structured shore areas. At the Gößl dam, for example, there are dense stands of graminaceous pondweed (Potamogeton gramineus) and shimmering pondweed (Potamogeton × nitens). Other vascular plants include Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), spiked milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), Berchtold's dwarf pondweed (Potamogeton berchtoldii), and curly pondweed (Potamogeton crispus), reflecting pondweed (Potamogeton lucens), floating pondweed (Potamogeton natans), and crested pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus), and hairy water crowfoot (Ranunculus trichophyllus). Brackish algae include the following species: Chara contraria, Chara globularis, Chara strigosa, and Chara virgata.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nOriginally, only the following eight fish species were native to Lake Grundlsee: burbot (Lota lota), chub (Squalius cephalus), minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), lake trout (Salmo trutta), Danube bleak (Alburnus chalcoides), and lake char (Salvelinus alpinus). The following fish species also occur as a result of artificial stocking or introduction Eel (Anguilla anguilla), Perch (Perca fluviatilis), Pike (Esox lucius), Bullhead (Cottus gobio) and Coregonus (Coregonus sp.).\nThe most conspicuous bird species at Lake Grundlsee and the other Salzkammergut lakes is the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor), which was first recorded at Lake Traunsee in 1875. It has been recorded at Grundlsee since the 1950s. Other common annual birds are the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the Coot (Fulica atra). Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula), Pochard (Aythya ferina) and Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) are less common. The cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) is native to Lake Grundlsee and feeds on the fish in the lake as well as the fish from the surrounding breeding grounds, which is why it is also hunted there.\n\n\n== Nature conservation ==\nThe Grundlsee is not a nature reserve, but the Totes Gebirge and Altausseer See European Nature Reserve no. 35, designated as part of the Natura 2000 network under the Habitats and Birds Directives, begins on the eastern shore. The Danube bleak (Chalcalburnus chalcoides), which lives in the lake, is a protected species under the Habitats Directive and migrates to the Toplitz and Stimitz creeks during the spawning season. To create additional spawning grounds for this and other species, the Stimitz estuary was renaturalized in 2016 and an oxbow was opened to restore the connection to the lake.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Shipping ===\n\nIn 1879, Albin Schraml founded a steamboat company and opened the small wooden steamboat Archduke Johann on June 14, 1879. The Grundlsee shipping company changed hands several times. In 2015, Tauroa GmbH took over the company from Dietrich Mateschitz. From the end of April to the end of October, scheduled and excursion boats operate on the lake with three motorboats (Rudolf, Traun and Gössl) as well as flatboats. The scheduled boats ply a north–south course between the western and southern shores. There are also several rental stations for electric boats. On Grundlsee, as on all lakes in the Inner Salzkammergut, internal combustion engines are prohibited. Exceptions are made for commercial fishing, regular shipping, and rescue and firefighting vehicles.\n\n\n=== Fishing ===\n\nThe Grundlsee lake has been used for fishing since the 13th century. Fishing is mentioned in the general urbarium of Duke Albrecht from 1280 to 1295. In 1425, a document issued by Frederick III listed the names of those who had the right to fish in the lake. Professional fishing flourished in the Middle Ages and net fishing was already highly developed. In the Middle Ages, live fish were still transported to the court in Graz in wooden barrels. In the 16th century, arctic char was delivered to the court in Vienna. Due to the long distances involved, they were often transported fried, salted, or pickled.\nToday the fishery is professionally managed by a professional fisherman from the Austrian Federal Forests. The main fish species is the lake char (Salvelinus umbla). The annual catch is about 3000 kg of fish. Similar to the nearby Hallstätter See, the catch should correspond to the annual natural growth in the water. The perch (Perca fluviatilis) was not originally native to the lake but was introduced at the end of the 1980s for unknown reasons. As an alien species, it changed the aquatic ecosystem and damaged the population of minnows and arctic char, on whose spawn it feeds. To restore the balance, attempts are being made to reduce the perch population. One way to do this is to sink spruce branches on which the perch spawn. The branches are retrieved and the fish eggs are destroyed. Since then, the main task of the Grundlsee fishery has been to rebuild the typical fish fauna of the area, especially the native Grundlsee char and the lake trout. The latter fish species reaches large proportions in the Grundlsee. The largest lake trout ever caught weighed 27 kg and is on display in the Grundlsee town hall.\nIn 2005, a mass infection of lake char with the tapeworm Triaenophorus crassus was detected for the first time. The tapeworm causes cysts in the flesh of the fish, making them unfit for human consumption. Whitefish are usually the intermediate host and pike the final host. In order to protect the char population, efforts have been made to remove pike from the lake. This is done through targeted fishing and catch bonuses. In order to rebuild a good population of lake char and brown trout in Lake Grundlsee, three year-round protected areas have been established where fishing is prohibited.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLake Grundlsee is a popular destination due to its beautiful location. The surrounding villages have a well-developed tourist infrastructure with accommodation and catering facilities. There is a campground on the eastern shore. Most of the shore is freely accessible. There are several public natural bathing areas and bathing jetties around the lake. There is an outdoor swimming pool in the village of Archkogl. The Grundlsee is also suitable for ice skating and ice stock sport, as it often freezes over in winter. During the Daffodils Festival, which lasts several days at the end of May/beginning of June, there is a boat parade on the lake every third year. Sculptures decorated with star daffodils are displayed.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nDue to the good wind conditions, the Grundlsee is a popular sailing and surfing area. The Styrian Yacht Club Grundlsee, located in the Bräuhof district, was founded in 1954. Grundlsee is often the site of a typical thermal, which can develop due to its topographical location. Under stable, fair weather conditions, the warming of the mountain massif in the northeast creates a vertical current in the early afternoon, which is fed by cool air from the western outflow into the basin in the east. This creates a constant fresh breeze even when the high pressure is stable. Because of the usually excellent visibility, the Grundlsee is a popular diving area. There is a diving school at the bathing area in Gößl.\nGrundlsee is the starting point for several hiking trails:\n\nPath 213: From Schachen via Gößler Alm to Wildgößl\nTrail 214: From Gößl via the Lahngang Lakes to the Pühringer Hut\nTrail 235: From the Grundlsee area via the Almbergweg to the Albert-Appel-Haus\nTrail 272: From Gößl to Schneckenalm\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThe Enns Valley was a settlement area of the Alpine Slavs and many place names are of Slavic origin. Grundlsee was first mentioned in 1188 as \"Chrungilse\" and goes back to the Old Slavic krǫglo jezero (round lake). The name was Germanized early on, as the Old Slavic nasal has been preserved. The hydronym was later adapted to the Middle High German grundel (gudgeon). The name of the stream that flows into it, the Toplitzbach, comes from the Slavic toplica, meaning warm spring water. Since it is the largest lake in Styria, the locals also call it the \"Styrian Sea\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAs with all the lakes in the inner Salzkammergut, there was also a splash dam for timber rafting at the outlet of the Grundlsee, where large quantities of water could be stored with relatively few resources. It was mentioned for the first time in the forest survey of 1561. At that time it was made entirely of wood. The average lifespan of a hermitage was 30 years. To reduce the high consumption of wood due to the frequent construction of new buildings, important hermitages were rebuilt with stone blocks in the middle of the 18th century as part of the reforms of Salzamtmann Freiherr von Sternbach. This was the case with the Grundlsee Lake Lodge in 1754. It was renovated in 1883. There was an outer rake to collect the flooded wood, which was probably built around 1300. An outer rake was probably built in the Grundlseetraun around 1500. After the brewery in Markt Aussee was closed in 1867, the rakes were no longer in use. The hermitage was probably destroyed by a flood in 1899. The last remains of the rakes were removed during the damming up of the river after the catastrophic floods of 1897 and 1899.\nThe lake lodge is a listed ensemble of buildings dating from the 16th century. It includes a fish cold store. It stands on stilts in the water and keeps fish in underwater cages.\nDuring World War II, Ausseer Land and Grundlsee were part of the Alpine Fortress and a retreat for the National Socialists. Villa Roth, used as a summer residence by Joseph Goebbels and his family, is located on the northeastern shore. From 1943 to 1945, the villa was the official office of the Chemical and Physical Research Institute of the Navy (CPVA), which maintained an experimental station on Lake Toplitz. At the end of the war, the Villa Castiglioni housed parts of the Führer Library, which had been created as part of the Linz Special Mission.\n\n\n== Lake Grundlsee in art and literature ==\n\nThe lake is the subject of the legend of Der Wassermann vom Grundlsee. The legend tells of fishermen who caught a merman. Out of pity, they released him and the water sprite revealed the salt deposits in the Sandling to them. The merman adorns the coat of arms of the municipality of Grundlsee.\n\nYou know! My sweet element turns sour and gives acquisition to you all! In your mountains lies the kernel; it runs salty and smokes at the two sea traunas!During the Biedermeier period, landscape painters came to the Salzkammergut and Lake Grundlsee. Rudolf von Alt, Conrad Kreuzer , and Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller created paintings of the lake and its surroundings. Views from the western shore to the Backenstein were particularly popular motifs.\nGrundlsee is the title of a novel by the Austrian writer Gustav Ernst.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOffice of the Styrian Provincial Government, Department of Water Supervision (ed.): 1.

        "content": "Erith Football Club was an association football club based in Erith, Kent, active in the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first records for the club are from the 1886–87 season; indeed the club was the first opponent for the Royal Arsenal club (after its renaming from Dial Square), at Plumstead Common in January 1887, which the home side won 6–1.\nIn early 1892, a number of clubs in the south of England discussed the formation of a new league competition.  Erith was one of the unsuccessful applicants, but one of the proposals was that the clubs with the fewest votes would take part in a subordinate competition.  The main competition did not in fact take place, but seven of the \"subordinate\" clubs, including Erith, set up the Southern Alliance.\nErith had a significant boost before the 1892–93 season started, by taking over the Maxim-Nordenfelt club, and it joined the Football Association.  Its league season was promising; although not every club played all 12 fixtures, Erith was second when the season ended, four points behind Old St Stephens (with one game in hand), but ahead of Tottenham Hotspur having played a game more - a 4–1 defeat at Old St Stephens in the final match played made Erith's last remaining match redundant.\nThe same season the club entered the FA Cup for the only time, but it lost 3–2 at Ilford in the first qualifying round.\nHowever the Southern Alliance did not survive to the 1893–94 season; although the Southern Football League did belatedly start, there was no room for Erith.  Without a league competition to join, and not having renewed its Football Association membership, Erith arranged a set of 29 friendly fixtures, with room for further fixtures.  There was still some interest, with 2,500 attending an 8–3 home defeat to Dartford in October.  However, before the end of the season, the club was dissolved; the reserve XI reconstituted itself as Erith Villa.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club played in blue and white shirts.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club played at the Erith Cricket Ground.  In 1892 it moved to a new ground at Lower Road.\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nJ. M. Bates (former Arsenal player) was the club captain in 1892–93.\nJimmy Meggs, another former Arsenal player who was also one of the founders of Royal Ordnance Factories F.C., who played for the club in its final season.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Magdalena Hinterdobler is a German operatic soprano, based at the Oper Frankfurt, where she has performed leading roles including Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Elisabetta in Verdi's Don Carlo and Grete in Zemlinsky's Der Traumgörge. She appeared as Anna in the world premiere of Gerd Kühr's Paradiese.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nHinterdobler was born in Straubing. She attended a gymnasium focused on music and was a member of its chamber choir, conducted by Gerold Huber, the father of the pianist. She took part in oratorio performances, with tours to Italy, and in opera productions, performing more and more demanding roles as a soloist. She was enrolled at the University of Music and Theatre Munich as a young student already when still going to school, and the studied voice there, together with several former members of the Tölzer Knabenchor, who influenced the class towards team spirit. She also studied at the Bayerische Theaterakademie August Everding, voice with Andreas Schmidt and Lied with Helmut Deutsch. She appeared on the stage of the Prinzregententheater in Mozart's La finta giardiniera in a student project with the academy.\nHinterdobler became a member of the ensemble of the Leipzig Opera in 1914, and remained until 2022. She appeared there in title roles in Dvořák's Rusalka and Marie in Smetana's The Bartered Bride. She performed as Micaëla in Bizet's Carmen, in Mozart roles and as Puccini's Mimì in La bohème and Liù in Turandot. She performed in 2017 as Ännchen in Weber's Der Freischütz, and a reviewer described her aria as a \"delicious account\". She appeared as Anna in the world premiere of Gerd Kühr's Paradiese, and a reviewer from the Süddeutsche Zeitung noted that she was an \"erotic elemental force ... with a colorful, sensual soprano\".\nHinterdobler appeared at the Oper Frankfurt as Eva in a new production of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg in 2022, directed by Johannes Erath and conducted by Sebastian Weigle. She became a member of the ensemble in 2023, and appeared there as Elisabetta in Verdi's Don Carlo and Chrysothemis in Elektra by Richard Strauss. She was cast as Grete in Zemlinsky's Der Traumgörge (Görge the Dreamer) in 2024, directed by Tilmann Köhler and conducted by Markus Poschner. Zemlinsky's work was not performed when it was composed in 1907 at the Vienna State Opera as planned by Gustav Mahler, then the music director, and was revived only in 1980. While the title character Görge is an outsider as a bookworm, dreamer and intellectual, Hinterdobler portrayed Grete whom he is supposed to marry  but she is unable to comprehend him. A reviewer noted that she took \"a more straightforwardly bold, sassy approach to the role\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMagdalena Hinterdobler discography at Discogs\nMagdalena Hinterdobler / soprano Operabase\nMagdalena Hinterdobler (management) Hartmut Haase\nBeyond the stage, zu \"Der Traumgörge\" | Mit M.

        "content": "Tenrin-Ō Meisei Kyōdan (天輪王明誠教団) is a Shinto-based Shinshūkyō (Japanese new religion) founded in 1881. It was founded by Oku Rokubē (奥六兵衛) as a confraternity (講, ko) of Tenrikyo in Kyoto.\nIt is currently based in 616 Arai-chō, Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama in the Kanagawa Prefecture.\n\n\n== History ==\nEarly Tenrikyo missionaries in the Kyoto region and its vicinities such as Tatekawa Wasuke (立川和助) and Yamanoto Genshichi (山本源七) were active due to the relative proximity from the founding place of Tenrikyo to the particular missionary areas in the early Meiji era. Oku Rokubē later became involved in Tenrikyo and became acquainted with one of the two, Tatekawa Wasuke. Oku had a different view on how the Terikyo doctrine, particularly in the name of the deity. Oku believed the name of God is Tenrin-Ō-no-Mikoto (天輪王命), in which it is a much more Buddhist-oriented term, while mainstream Tenrikyo doctrine expresses that the name of God is Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto (天理王命). Oku's other influence was his additional background in Onmyōdō.\nOku received the name of his confraternity in Kyoto from the Tenrikyo foundress, Nakayama Miki, as Meisei (明聖). \nThe name coined by the foundress symbolized the core Tenrikyo theology of the underlying natural causality as shown via the moon and the sun (月日, Tsukihi). There were disputes with the Tenrikyo headquarters during his tenure as a head of the confraternity. However, despite the uncomfortable relationship, he managed to preserve the legacies of the Tenrikyo's foundress.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Forum of the Democratic Right (Polish: Forum Prawicy Demokratycznej, FPD) was a conservative political party in Poland from 1990 to 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nIn July 1979, the Young Poland Movement (RMP) split off from the Movement for Defence of Human and Civic Rights. The Movement was a rightwing anti-communist opposition group founded in July 1979, setting the reclamation of total sovereignty as its primary goal.\nOn 15 September 1989, the radical National Democratic, National Catholic branch of RMP took part in the creation of the Christian National Union. Their departure from RMP deprived the Movement of a large part of its members, and quickly led to its collapse. The moderate, centre-right branch established the Polish Political Movement (Ruch Polityki Polskiej (Polish), RPP).\nA precursor to FPD, the short-lived \"Democratic Christian-Liberal Forum\" (Polish: Demokratyczne Forum Chrześcijańsko-Liberalne) was founded on 15 June 1990. It existed as a member of the Kraków-based Alliance for Democracy (Polish: Sojusz na rzecz Demokracji).\n\n\n=== FPD as a party ===\nThe Forum was founded on 27 June 1990, by representatives of different political groupings - members of RPP, several economic, commercial, and industrial councils, academic unions, newspaper editors, representatives of several sejmiks, as well as several major political figures: Senators Stanisław Somma and Jerzy Dietl, Minister Tadeusz Syryjczyk, Deputy Minister Michal Wojtczak, deputy editor-in-chief of Życie Warszawy Tomasz Wołek, Henryk Woźniakowski, Sejm Representative Michał Chałoński and, as a guest, Minister and future FPD leader Aleksander Hall. Therein it declared its intentions of creating a \"big-tent Alliance for Democracy\" and support for Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his government.\nThe Forum often cooperated with the Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action (Polish: Ruch Obywatelski Akcja Demokratyczna, ROAD). The two were crucial allies in Mazowiecki's political battle against Solidarność leader Lech Wałęsa, and supported the Prime Minister's candidacy in the 1990 Polish presidential election. Mazowiecki decisively lost the election, falling third behind dark horse candidate Stanisław Tymiński. ROAD and FPD reluctantly endorsed Wałesa in the second round, which led to his election as the President of Poland with a decisive 74.25% of the vote. The humiliated Mazowiecki would resign from the office of Prime Minister on 12 January 1991, which cast FPD and ROAD into de facto parliamentary opposition.\nDuring the first Congress of the FPD on 3–9 November 1990, it elected Hall as its leader, and declared an intention to co-found a larger political formation with ROAD.\n\n\n=== Dissolution ===\nOn 11 May 1991, the FPD came into agreement with ROAD to form a new political party, the Democratic Union (UD), wherein they would contend the 1991 Polish parliamentary election together. The Democratic Union would win 62 seats, becoming the largest party in the First Sejm, until FPD's members left UD later in the First Sejm's term.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe party was compared to Christian democratic, conservative, liberal and nationalist formations. It espoused the rule of law, strong executive powers and reformism. It claimed to be based on Christian values.\nEconomically, it supported free market economics, private ownership, privatization and reprivatization, seeking to replicate the Spanish or Italian economic models. It also supported privatizing and demonopolizing the insurance system. It also advocated for European integration.\nIn terms of foreign policy, it supported reconciliation with reunited Germany and the Soviet Union (later Russia).\n\n\n== Electoral results ==\n\n\n=== Presidential ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leonia Nastał (born Maria Nastał; 8 November 1903 – 10 January 1940) was a Polish Catholic nun from the Congregation of the Sisters Handmaids of the Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate, a mystic, religious writer, the Venerable of the Catholic Church, and advocate of the idea of mystical spiritual infancy. She entered the Congregation of the Sisters Handmaids of the Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate in Stara Wieś in 1925 at the age of 22. In the 1930s, she claimed to have mystical revelations of Jesus Christ, during which she was shown a way of life based on humility and unlimited trust in God. In her final years, afflicted by illness, she spent time receiving treatment in Szczawnica. She died in January 1940 in Stara Wieś, regarded for her holiness. The process of her beatification is currently underway.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nMaria Nastał was born in Stara Wieś, a village near the town of Brzozów in the Dynowskie Foothills in the Outer Subcarpathia. Her parents, Franciszek Nastał (born 1879) and Katarzyna née Jopów, were smallholding peasants. Church records indicate that Maria's father was an unbalanced man prone to drinking and quarreling. He ruled the family with an iron fist and demanded absolute obedience. Her mother, on the other hand, was balanced, cheerful, and very devout; Maria learned about religiosity from her through shared prayers and reading religious books. Maria Nastał had an older sister, Stefania, and a younger brother, Stanisław. Two other siblings died in childhood. Due to the poverty prevailing in Galicia, her father emigrated to America for work for 18 years in the early 20th century. The family made a living from a small farm, odd jobs for others, and money sent by the father.\nShe received the sacrament of baptism on 9 November 1903. The godparents were Jan Cichoń and Anna Leń. She received her First Holy Communion on 15 June 1911, and on November 18 of the same year, she was confirmed by Bishop Karol Fischer. In Maria's hometown, there are still Jesuit monasteries and convents of the Handmaids of the Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate. Maria attended the village primary school from 1910 to 1916. At home, she helped with cattle herding.\nThe outbreak of World War I worsened the family's already difficult financial situation and led to a break in contact with her father. Maria Nastał's mother, Katarzyna, seeing her younger daughter's abilities, did not want her to interrupt her education and sent her for private English lessons in Brzozów. When the front moved away from the family's area, and her father sent a written permission, Maria continued her education at the 6-grade Queen Jadwiga Public School in Brzozów from 1917 to 1919 and completed the fifth and sixth grades. In 1919, she applied to join the Congregation of the Sisters Handmaids of the Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate but was not accepted due to her father's opposition.\nDuring her youth, the Jesuit priests leading the parish had a significant influence on her, especially Father Kutyba, who was her confessor and taught her about sacrificial love for Jesus Christ and striving for perfection. Maria Nastał inherited a deeply religious foundation from her mother through conversations about God, reading the Bible together, and prayer. She received Holy Communion every day. The conviction of her religious vocation appeared very early, at the age of only three. At the age of 18, she secretly burned the name of Jesus on her chest with a hot nail, which became infected. Her father Franciszek, who returned from America in 1921, vehemently opposed her desire to enter the convent, but due to his daughter's act with the nail, he stopped trying to change her decision, although he did not reconcile with it. On 8 November 1921, Maria Nastał left her family home and went to the Benedictine convent in Staniątki to study at the local teacher training college, but she did not feel comfortable there. After the school year ended, she went home for vacation and stayed there. In 1923, her older sister got married, but her brother was born, so she was not the only heir to her parents' farm.\n\n\n=== Religious life ===\nFinally, Franciszek Nastał announced to his daughter that he did not want to see her in his house, and after 8 years of efforts, Maria entered the Congregation of the Sisters Handmaids of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a religious order founded by Father Edmund Bojanowski, on 31 December 1925. She first underwent a 3-month postulant; she attended Holy Masses, participated in spiritual exercises, and prayed together with the sisters. On 18 April 1926, the ceremony of investiture took place; Maria Nastał received the name Leonia and henceforth wore a habit and veil. Then Leonia Nastał began a 2-year novitiate, under the guidance of Sister Zofia Szmyd. She was well-liked by other novices. She knew how to play the pump organ and sometimes replaced the organist.\nIn July 1927, after completing her first canonical year of novitiate, she went to Wyżniany near Lviv for a mission, where she was to become more acquainted with the works of the Congregation and the duties of her vocation, and also to discern whether she would be capable of receiving religious vows. In Wyżniany, Sister Leonia took care of orphans from the local preschool. After three months, she was assigned for three weeks to Biłka Szlachecka as an organist. Then, on the orders of her superiors, in November 1927, Sister Leonia went to Przemyśl to continue her education. From there, she returned to the motherhouse of the congregation to prepare for her three-year vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, which she took there on 23 April 1928. Her immediate family, except for her father, attended the ceremony.\nAfter taking her vows, she remained in Stara Wieś and for 9 months studied English in preparation to go to the United States, where the Congregation had had missions since 1926, and work for the American-Polish community. However, she did not get the visa from the American consulate, so she did not leave. In November 1928, she went to Przemyśl to continue her studies, and she lived there until December 1932. On 20 April 1931, after completing her first profession, she renewed her religious vows for the second three-year period in Stara Wieś. On 30 November 1932, she externally passed the maturity exam at the X Male State Humanistic Gymnasium in Lviv.\nIn December 1932, she went to Stara Wieś and for several weeks gave history lectures to novices, and in January 1933, she went to Poznań, where she took care of sisters participating in a 6-week pedagogical course. She also taught them Polish and German there. At that time, due to poor living conditions, she experienced the first symptoms of tuberculosis, which was a fatal disease at that time. In March 1933, she went to a congregation facility in Łódź and helped in educational work at the orphanage. On 13 April 1934, Sister Leonia made her perpetual profession to Mother General Eleonora Jankiewicz, in the presence of a chaplain and her parents. In September 1934, Father Kazimierz Schmelzer became her spiritual director. With his permission, she began to write down her spiritual experiences in September 1935. From 1935 to 1937, she stayed in Poznań, where she managed the convent and took care of the sisters who were studying, totaling 74. Her mystical experiences during her time in Poznań are documented in her writings.\n\n\n==== Stay in Szczawnica and death ====\n\nIn the second half of the fourth decade of the 20th century, her health began to deteriorate. After being diagnosed with infiltrations and tuberculosis lesions in her lungs, she went for treatment to Szczawnica on 29 October 1937. The illness aroused her joy and hope for a swift reunion with Jesus Christ. While undergoing treatment, Sister Leonia devoted herself primarily to literary work, but also served as a sacristan in the convent chapel, helped the sisters with daily tasks, and corresponded with her superior. She also assisted during Holy Mass. Her health condition continued to worsen, and the disease attacked her digestive tract. In December 1939, sensing her impending death, Sister Leonia, with the consent of the Mother Superior, moved from Szczawnica to Stara Wieś. In mid-December, at the direction of the Mother Superior General, she began writing her autobiography, which she completed on 2 January 1940.\nShe passed away around 4:30 PM on 10 January 1940, in her hometown. She was buried in the local cemetery on January 13. In 1979, her remains were exhumed and placed in the crypt of the congregation's motherhouse in Stara Wieś.\n\n\n== Beatification process ==\nIn 1962, the Congregation of the Handmaids began efforts to beatify Sister Leonia. In December 1969, Bishop Ignacy Tokarczuk of Przemyśl submitted a votum to the Holy See to initiate the cognitional process. On 9 January 1976, the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints announced the decree Nihil obstat, allowing the process to begin in the diocese, which commenced on 8 December 1976. After the conclusion of the cognitional process on 15 September 1980, the documents were sent to the Holy See on 31 October 1980. On 13 March 1998, the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints issued a decree validating the cognitional process. In late June and July 2006, the drafting of the document Positio concerning the Venerable Leonia Nastał was completed and submitted to the Secretariat of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in Rome. On 2 December 2016, the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, at the direction of Pope Francis, published a decree on the heroic virtues of Sister Leonia. Henceforth, she holds the title of the Venerable.\n\n\n== Spirituality ==\nWhile in Poznań, Leonia Nastał experienced mystical encounters in which Jesus Christ allegedly revealed to her the path to holiness based on humility and unlimited trust in God. Initially, Leonia Nastał drew inspiration from St. Thérèse of Lisieux and her spiritual childhood. However, later the main idea of her mysticism, as described in the book Uwierzyłam miłości, became what is known as spiritual infancy. It was characterized by humility, awareness of one's own weakness and inability to act without God's help, sincerity, simplicity, gentleness, sweetness, and innocence. In one of her letters, she wrote that, in her opinion, spiritual infancy is the shortest way to heaven. She believed that submitting to God's will as a spiritual infant was more valuable than voluntary martyrdom. She consulted everything in her inner life that the voice of Jesus commanded her with her confessor.\nLeonia Nastał reportedly experienced periods of spiritual \"dryness\" and ecstasies. She would sometimes burst into tears uncontrollably. She voluntarily undertook ascetic practices: she fasted several times a week, used disciplines, slept on wooden planks, and whipped herself. She also mortified herself by enduring humiliations and quarrels from her father in silence, giving up minor pleasures, and refraining from eating favorite dishes. She did this to compensate God for her own imperfections and to obtain grace for others. She considered prayer, which she defined as the soul's being with God, to be the most effective means of sanctification. In her youth, she mainly prayed using the rosary. Everyday, she did examination of conscience. She made a private vow to maintain chastity even before entering the convent.\nLeonia Nastał exerted a significant influence on the sisters of the Congregation. According to the testimony of Mother Eleonora Jankiewicz, her presence and behavior contributed to raising their level of religious life. The nun's father, although initially categorically opposed to his daughter's vocation, embittered by her decision, did not participate in the ceremony of investiture and vows, but under her influence, he converted and began to attend Mass and receive communion daily.\nAmong the saints, she particularly revered the Mother of God and Saint Joseph, the two patrons of the Congregation. She was also inspired by St. John of the Cross and Piotr Semenenko. The motto of her life was I Believed in Eternal Love. Her favorite book was The Story of a Soul by St. Thérèse.\nAccording to Cecylian Niezgoda of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual, Leonia Nastał made at least two mistakes in her mystical spiritual life. In a letter to her spiritual director, Father Kazimierz Schmelzer, she wrote: The Lord Jesus will heal Rev. Spiritual Father; he promised me this, and I thanked Him in advance, but Father Schmelzer did not recover. In a letter a month later, she wrote that Jesus promised to heal Father Schmelzer, but he postponed the fulfillment of his promise. In another instance, before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was convinced that the war would not happen. In one of her letters to her spiritual director, she expressed doubts whether she was adding something to what her \"inner voice\" told her. However, Father Schmelzer was convinced that Leonia Nastał's prayer was a Christian mysticism.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\nLeonia Nastał wrote poems, plays, speeches, stage works, and essays; they were used for educational purposes as well as in various church ceremonies and the educational activities of the Sisters of the Congregation of the Sisters Handmaids of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate. She wrote on commission, most often for the sisters or individuals involved in educational work. Her literary work was a source of religious knowledge, addressing issues of moral education as well. In her works, she taught love for one's neighbor, kindness, respect for the elderly and disabled, as well as patriotism and the search for God in nature and in other people. She also wrote for Róża Duchowna, a Lviv magazine dedicated to the rosary brotherhoods.\nThe writings of Leonia Nastał can be divided into three groups: various educational works in terms of genre, letters, and notes concerning her inner life. The third group of writings includes Notatki rekolekcyjne covering the years 1926–1934, conducted at the request of her confessor, Father Wojciech Trubak; Dziennik duchowny in eight consecutive notebooks covering the years 1934–1939; and Historia powołania, an autobiographical essay written shortly before her death at the request of Mother General Eleonora Jankiewicz. Her literary legacy consists of 1,620 pages of manuscript. Personal notes of Sister Leonia, depicting her inner life, cover 391 pages of manuscript. Letters written to her confessor, fellow sisters, and other individuals cover 505 pages of manuscript.\n\n\n== Publications and works ==\nShe is the author of several publications, also translated into other languages:\n\nNastał, Leonia Maria; Jaroszewska, Wincenta Jadwiga (1981).

        "content": "Truckin' with Albert Collins is an album by the American musician Albert Collins, released in 1969. It was originally released as The Cool Sounds of Albert Collins, in 1965. It was reissued by MCA Records in 1991.\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduced by Bill Hall, the album was recorded at Gold Star Studios, in Houston, Texas. Nine of the tracks, recorded in 1962 and 1963, had already been released as singles; \"Icy Blue\", \"Kool Aide\", and \"Shiver 'n Shake\" date to April 1965 sessions. The initial Blue Thumb release was channeled for stereo sound. Many of the tracks employ a horn section. Collins used open D-minor and F-minor tunings and played without a pick. He sings on \"Dyin' Flu\", perhaps his first recorded vocal performance.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Detroit Free Press opined that \"the dynamic levels, moods, metronomic speeds, and rhythms ... are so very similar that it's practically impossible to tell one selection from another.\" The Province said that Collins has \"striven for an instrumental approach that, while acknowledging the profound influence of [T-Bone] Walker and [Albert] King, is an immediately recognizable, wholly personable mode of expression.\" The Edmonton Journal praised the \"hard-drivin, fast-rollin contemporary blues... Easily the best modern interpreter of old-style 'truckin'' blues.\"\nThe San Francisco Examiner stated that the 1991 reissue \"restores a crucial classic of the literature.\" AllMusic wrote that \"his trademark sound is in place—his leads are stinging, piercing and direct.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide noted the \"eerie tone clusters.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Santa Maria Assunta is a mixed Romanesque and Gothic-style, Roman Catholic parish church, with the facade on Piazza San Bernadino da Siena in the town center of Camaiore in the province of Lucca, Tuscany, Italy. The church is near the city hall of the town.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nA church titled Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Burgo Campi Majoris is documented here since 1260. It appears to have been consecrated in 1278. The stone bell-tower was completed in 1356.\nIn 1387, the church was granted by pope Urban VI the privilege of celebrating baptism. In 1515, the church was granted the title of Collegiata, and in 1796, as collegiata insigne.\nWhile the robust walls of stone with rounded portals recall Romanesque construction, the facade is tall and has a its top a rose window. The church has been modified over the centuries; in 1448 the building was widened, and the facade only completed in 1458. A major refurbishment took place in the 18th-century under the architect Tommaso Pezzini, The interior was adapted to late-baroque fashion and reconsecrated by the Archbishop of Lucca Filippo Sardi on 1799. The refurbishment in 1915 removed some of the baroque elements, and attempted to restore the structure to its Romanesque origins.\nThe nave is roofed with a barrel vault, while the aisles are surmounted by rib vaults. The side altars date to the 17th and 18th centuries, while the 19th-century main altar was designed by Vincenzo Santini. The 14th-century bastismal font at the entrance of the church contained sculpted reliefs depicting the Good Shepherd, Adam and Eve, the serpent with the apple, and the archangel guarding paradise. The other font has a relief representing a baptism with an inscription: “Venite filii audite me timore Domini docebo vos”. On both the sides of the relief are the Guinigi coat of arms and the emblem of Camaiore\nThe church has a 15th-century pipe organ restored by Benedetto and Luigi Tronci in the 18th-century and again in the following century. Of the works of art in the church is a 13th-century painted wooden crucifix on the first altar. In the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, is a depiction of the Communion of the Apostles by Pier Dandini. In the chapel of the Virgin of the Annunciation, there is an altarpiece on this topic (1805) by Stefano Tofanelli. The church once had a Madonna statue by the 15th century sculptor Matteo Civitali, but that is now sheltered in the Museum of Sacred Art of Camaiore. In the apse are four canvas by the Benedetto Brandimante from Lucca: an Assumption of the Virgin; Saints Peter and Paul at the Coronation of the Virgin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBellato, Franco, La Chiesa Collegiata di Santa Maria Assunta.

        "content": "Mary S. Cummins (née, Slemons; 1854–1904) was an American educator. She was the leader of various religious, social reform, and teachers' organizations, serving as president of the Synodical Missionary Society, the Montana State Teachers' Association, and the Montana State Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Stuart Slemons was born in Jonesborough, Tennessee, May 31, 1854. She was of Pennsylvania Dutch origin, but her ancestors, both maternal and paternal, were for a long time residents of the South. Her father, William C. Slemons (d. 1887), a native of Tennessee, married Miss Maria Dosser, also of that State. They reared a family of seven children, Cummins being the fourth born. The father was by trade a tanner and was engaged in that business all his life. He was an Elder in the Presbyterian Church.\nCummins was reared and educated to graduation at 16 years of age in her native town. Ambitious to go beyond the academic course, she pushed her way, by her own efforts, to graduating with a full diploma from the Augusta Female Seminary (now, Mary Baldwin University), Staunton, Virginia.\n\n\n== Career ==\nReturning to Tennessee in 1874, she began teaching, and for nine years, was principal and teacher of the Knoxville High School, remaining in Knoxville until 1886. Finding time to enter other fields, a very large mission Sunday school became a part of her work. She also served as president of the Synodical Missionary Society and a State member of the executive board of Home Missions of New York for the Presbyterian Church. An effort was made to place her in charge of school interests in Mexico, but that did not seem to be compatible with her other duties.\nIn 1886, partly for a change of climate and partly to embrace the business opportunities afforded in a rich new place, she came with her husband to Montana Territory. They settled in Helena, where Mr. Cummins became engaged in the real estate business, both on his own account and for others, and also had interests in various mining enterprises.\nSoon after their coming to Helena, Mary Cummins accepted the position as principal of Helena High School, in which she served for five years, and which she resigned in order to accept a position as preceptor in the Montana Wesleyan University in September 1891. There, she was in change of the young ladies' department and professor of Latin and modern languages. Cummins, together with Prof. Joseph C. Templeton, also a professor in Montana Wesleyan, handled the inside management of university affairs.\nDuring her residence in Montana, she attained a high standing among the educators of the State, and was chosen by them successively as vice president and president of the Montana State Teachers' Association. She also served as a member of the state board of charities and reforms for Montana, being confirmed in 1895.\nIn temperance work, she took a leading part, including serving as president of the Montana State WCTU. In 1891, she was commissioned by Frances Willard as national organizer for the vacation months, to work in Montana, and she traveled over a large part of the State, organizing new unions. Partly as a result of that tour, the banner presented by Willard for the largest percentage of gain in membership in the Western States was given to Montana in 1891.\nOn June 22, 1897, Cummins filed an application for a patent, under the mining laws of Congress, for 1,467.4 feet (447.3 m) of the Lizzie lode and 835.4 feet (254.6 m) of the Brandon lode, designated as Surveys No. 4858 and 4859, situated in (unorganized) mining district, Jefferson County, Montana.\nIn her later life, Cummins served as lady principal of Occidental College, at Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1877, she married W. F. Cummins, a merchant of Knoxville.\nMary Stuart Slemons Cummins died in Los Angeles, October 1, 1894. She was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Mary Stuart Cummins at Wikisource",

        "content": "The 2024 LPL season is the 12th and ongoing season of the League of Legends Pro League (LPL), a Chinese professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. Similar to its previous yearly splits, the 2024 LPL season will be divided into two splits: Spring and Summer. The Spring Split began on 22 January and will end on 20 April 2024 for the Grand Finals. Meanwhile, the Summer Split will begin in the latter part of 2024 following the conclusion of the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) 2024.\nBilbili Gaming was crowned the 2024 Spring Champions after defeating Top Esports 3–1 in the Grand Finals rematch of the Upper Bracket Finals. This was Bilibili Gaming's first organizational title under the name Bilibili Gaming in the LPL. The team previously defeated Top Esports in the Upper Bracket Finals 3-2 and Top Esports defeating defending MSI champions JD Gaming 3–1 in the Lower Bracket Finals. Bilibili Gaming is set to qualify for MSI 2024's Group Stage alongside the champions of the LCS, LCK and LEC, while Top Esports will be pooled with the runner-up teams to qualify for the play-in tournament as per the new MSI rules.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe Spring Split will have seventeen (17) competing teams during the Regular Season. Each team will participate in the single Round-robin tournament where all matches will be played in best-of-threes. Similarly to its previous seasons, the top ten (10) teams will advance to the playoff bracket with the Top 2 seeded teams advancing to the four-team Double-elimination tournament bracket while the remaining eight (8) teams will be competing in a single-elimination king-of-the hill tournament with only the top two teams from these competitions advancing to complete the four-team double elimination bracket. The champion for Spring 2024 will qualify for the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational's group stage while the runner-up will qualify for the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational's play-in stage.\n\n\n== Spring ==\n\n\n=== Regular Season ===\nSpring 2024 is the second-consecutive season where the Top seed only lost one game during the entirety of the regular season. Moreover, Bilibili Gaming is the first organization thus far to go back-to-back 15-1 records in two different splits. BLG went 15–1 in the Summer Split and finished Spring 2024 with another 15–1 record.\n\n\n=== Playoffs ===\nDefending Mid-Season Invitational champions JD Gaming was eliminated during the Lower Bracket Finals over Top Esports and will not be able to defend their title in London. However, two of their former players, 369 and knight, will defend their title when MSI comes to Chengdu. Furthermore, Bilibili Gaming will return to MSI 2024 as one of the four group-stage qualifying teams. Top Esports' defeat means their qualification to MSI 2024 will be through the Play-In stage where they are group alongside the 2023 League of Legends World Champions T1.\n\n\n==== Bracket ====\n\n\n== References ==",

The app is a built in platform inside of the Amazon app which allows users (mainly Internet influencers) to upload videos showcasing or promoting personal or sponsored products. The app was created to compete with TikTok Shop, a similar shopping platform integrated into the TikTok application.\n\n\n== History ==\nAmazon started testing a beta version of the platform in August 2022. The platform was then officially released in December 2022 to the public.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nUsers can access the Inspire feature at a sparkle icon in the navigation bar on the bottom of the app. Once clicked, users are able to browse through videos showcasing various products tailored to their interests. They can interact with these posts by liking them. An algorithm then analyzes the user's interactions and tailors the content further to match their preferences, providing a personalized browsing experience.\nUsers have the option to upload a video promoting a product, along with a description and relevant tags. Upon upload, the video undergoes a moderation process to ensure compliance with Amazon's terms of service and appropriateness standards. This process helps maintain the integrity of the platform and ensures that only suitable content is shared with the community.\n\n\n== References ==",

Copies were sent to purchasers on 8 April 2013, the day of death of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The band had split up in 2012.\nIt was labelled on the album sleeve with \"On the death of Lady Margaret Hilda Thatcher\" and described by the band as \"a small and perfectly-formed segment of the celebrations\".\nThe album's full-length tracks are 1940s-inspired \"So Long, So Long\", and folky \"Waiting for Margaret to Go\". They are interspersed with shorter tracks, quotes and samples including \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" from 1939's The Wizard of Oz. Electronica-themed track The Day the Lady Died credits Czech electro band Midi lidi, who later released an extended version on their own Soundcloud identifying it as a reworking of their track \"Je toho hodně co říct\".\nThe band accompanied the release with a statement on their website:\n\nThis is a cause to celebrate, to party, to stamp the dirt down. Tomorrow we can carry on shouting and writing and working and singing and striking against the successive governments that have so clearly followed Thatcher’s Slash & Burn policies, none more so than the present lot. [...] If we must show a little reverence and decorum at this time, then so be it. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families of all Margaret Thatcher’s victims.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bligh Bros. or Bligh Brothers of Canterbury was a British coachbuilder initially producing carriages and, in the 20th century, bodies for automobiles. Among the most famous creations by Bligh are the unique race cars known as Chitty Bang Bang, which inspired the book Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang by author Ian Fleming and the later film adaptation, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\n\n== Company History ==\n\nBligh was based in the southeast English city of Canterbury. The company was founded in 1812 by William Bligh, who initially worked as a wheelwright. By the mid-19th century, his sons William, John, Jasper, and Henry took over the business. Around 1860, the company started producing complete carriages. Initially, Bligh mainly served local clients from the county of Kent, but around 1870, it expanded to London. The Bligh brothers opened a showroom in the city center at Covent Garden. In the British capital, the company achieved several successes; Bligh's designs won awards at national and international exhibitions multiple times.\nWith the increasing popularity of automobiles at the beginning of the 20th century, numerous British carriage manufacturers shifted their production to automobile bodies. Examples include Barker, Maythorn, and Rippon Brothers. Whether Bligh Bros. also followed this path in the first decade of the 20th century is unclear. However, it is certain that during this period, Bligh faced financial difficulties, had to give up the showroom in London, and was bankrupt by 1913.\nAfter the end of World War I, Bligh was taken over by the Polish Count Louis Zborowski, who lived at the Higham Park estate near Canterbury. Zborowski, a passionate amateur racing driver, constructed four race cars, which he named Chitty Bang Bang. Some of them were equipped with airplane engines. Bligh produced the bodies. At the same time, Bligh produced bodies for road vehicles from Aston Martin and Hispano-Suiza, unique pieces which were commissioned by Zborowski.\nAfter Zborowski's accidental death in October 1924 at the Italian Grand Prix, Bligh ceased coachbuilding. The company focused on repairing automobiles and car trading. Over the following decades, numerous branches were added to the main headquarters in Canterbury, throughout eastern Kent. The business eventually closed in 1974.\nThe building on Radigund Street in Canterbury, where Bligh Bros. had its headquarters, still exists.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nNick Walker: A–Z of British Coachbuilders 1919–1960.

        "content": "The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music is a 2021 autobiography by American rock musician Dave Grohl, founder of Foo Fighters and formerly drummer of Nirvana. The book consists of a selection of short stories and anecdotes, which Grohl likened to the songs on an album. The Storyteller was praised as upbeat and enjoyable, but criticized for being sparing on subjects such as Nirvana.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Grohl opened an Instagram account @davestruestories, in which he told short stories from his life. Several of these, such as being hit with a golf club as a child, are featured in the book. Grohl likened the compilation of stories to making an album, as he had to choose the right stories to open and close the book, as well as have appropriate sequencing in between. Grohl said that parts of the book were cut by publishers for being offensive.\nThe book was announced in April 2021, to be released on October 5. In November 2023, Grohl released an extended paperback edition of the book, featuring essays on creativity, details of the creation of four Foo Fighters songs, and an account of meeting Paul McCartney that was previously exclusive to the audiobook.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nGrohl narrates his life, from his childhood in suburban Virginia when he practiced drumming on his own teeth, to dropping out of high school to play in the punk band Scream. He then joins the ascendant Nirvana, initially sleeping on singer Kurt Cobain's couch and living in squalor. Nirvana's rise ends with Cobain's 1994 suicide, following which Grohl founds Foo Fighters, playing every instrument on their eponymous debut album.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSeveral reviewers found The Storyteller to be upbeat and enjoyable, but to be brief or lacking on several subjects, including Nirvana, Cobain's suicide, Grohl and bassist Krist Novoselic's prolonged legal conflict with Cobain's widow Courtney Love, Grohl's first marriage and the frequent rotation of members of Foo Fighters. The use of an unorthodox font for emphasis was criticized.\nGrohl did a one-man show titled The Storyteller in which he told monologues of stories from the book, along with performances of his songs. Ian Gittin praised the performance in The Guardian, but found both the book and the show to be too long.\nThe book went straight to number one on the hardcover non-fiction charts in the United States, and remained there for a second week.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stronghold (foaled January 24, 2021) is a multiple-Grade winning American Thoroughbred racehorse. In 2024, as a three-year-old colt, he won the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby at Santa Anita Park.\n\n\n== Background ==\nStronghold is a bay colt who was bred in Kentucky by Eric and Sharon Waller. They also own the horse. The Waller family have been involved with lineage from the fourth dam One Stop. The third dam, Swiss Diva, died while giving birth to the second dam, Diva's Tribute. Also Stronghold's dam, Spectator, died in 2021 while giving birth to him. Spectator went on to win the Sorrento Stakes and finished second in the Grade 2 Santa Anita Oaks to Midnight Bisou. \nStronghold's sire is Ghostzapper, the 2004 Horse of the Year and a member of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In October 2020, Ghostzapper was relocated to Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Kentucky where he stands for $75,000 (2024).\nStronghold is trained by Philip D'Amato.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old season ===\nStronghold made his debut on August 27, in a maiden special weight event over 6 furlongs at Ellis Park. From post six in a field of eight, he broke well and prompted the speed three wide. He battled with the eventual winner Awesome Road through the midstretch but with about 100 yards to run was turned away to finish 2+3⁄4 lengths in second place but 10 lengths ahead of the third-place finished.\nIn his next start on at Churchill Downs on October 1, in maiden special weight event over one mile Stronghold started as the 11/20 odds-on favorite and defeated Resilience and Track Phantom.  The quality of the field was commendable as all three place-getters would win Graded stakes and all three would qualify for the Kentucky Derby the following year.\nAt his first attempt in graded company Stronghold face three other horses in the Grade 3 Bob Hope Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack. Chosen as the 9/2 second favorite Stronghold was soundly defeated by the odds-on favorite Nysos by nearly nine lengths in a time of 1:21.71 for the 7 furlongs.\nIn his last of the year Stronghold faced four other juveniles in the Grade II Los Alamitos Futurity at Los Alamitos Race Course. Starting as the 4-1 third choice in the field Stronghold jumped out of the gate unhurried. At field approached the second turn Stronghold  challenged from the rail and as they entered into the stretch, the race came down to longshot Wynstock and Stronghold. Stronghold got the advantage, but Wynstock wrested the lead back bumping each other before Wynstock pulled away to win by a half-length in 1:43.53. The stewards posted the inquiry sign following the race because of the contact. However, they ruled that there would be no change, determining that both horses contributed to the incident.\n\n\n=== 2024: three-year-old season ===\nStronghold started his three-year-old campaign away from his base in California traveling to New Mexico and running in the Grade III Sunland Park Derby at Sunland Park on February 18. Stronghold dueled with local hero Lucky Jeremy through a first quarter in :23.69 and a half-mile in :47.45. Putting a head in front at the three-quarter marker, Stronghold then showed his dominance, pushing clear in the stretch despite a valiant effort from Lucky Jeremy for a 2+1⁄2 lengths victory in a time of 1:42.64 setting a new stakes record for the 1+1⁄16 miles.\nIn his next start on April 6, Stronghold returned to California and started as the 11/5 second favorite in the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby at Santa Anita Park. Facing the Bob Baffert-trained even-money favorite Imagination, jockey Antonio Fresu had Stronghold in fourth behind a first quarter-mile in :22.72 and a half-mile in :46.73. Stronghold didn't get a completely trouble-free trip, lacking room at the quarter pole before splitting rivals at the top of the stretch. From there he took on Imagination for a stretch battle that could have gone either way. Neither colt gave in, and at the wire, Stronghold bravely stuck his neck out in front, in a time of 1:49.98. Antonio Fresu won his first Grade I in the US and Stronghold earned 100 qualification points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby and easily qualified for the first leg of the Triple Crown.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Corteiz Rules The World (CRTZ) is a London-based streetwear brand founded in 2017 by British-Nigerian entrepreneur Clint, popularly known as Clint 419. The brand's logo features the Alcatraz the former prison island. The clothes also feature the tagline \"Rules The World\".\n\n\n== History ==\nCorteiz was founded in 2017. It first launched a limited collection of screen-printed t-shirts and crewnecks featuring the Alcatraz logo. The logo is symbolic of the brands main message which is rebellion against convention. The brand has since then expanded its product offering including tracksuits, shoes and bags.\nCorteiz has gained popularity in the fashion industry due to its use of guerilla marketing strategies.\nIn 2021, Nike sued Corteiz and the owner Clint. The lawsuit was because the brand's name was similar to the Nike Cortez sneaker. Clint was ordered to pay £1,850 GBP. In 2023 however, two brands collaborated on a sneaker release.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nIn 2021, Corteiz launched their tshirt in Soho. Customers would exchange their metro tickets for the limited Corteiz Tshirt. Videos of hundred of people participating in the exchange were shared on social media, generating hype for the brand\nIn 2022, the brand's founder Clint communicated via Twitter that the brand would swap the Corteiz Bolo Jacket with other jackets from high-end brands such as The North Face, Moncler, Supreme, Canada Goose, Stüssy, Arc'teryx and Palace. The campaign generated buzz for the brand on social media. The founder, via X (formerly Twitter) communicated that the jackets collected would be donated to the homeless.\nIn 2022, the brand held the 99p Market Stall pop-up to sell their new cargos for 99 pence. The requirement was that buyers show up with exactly 99p. On the day of the sale, the brand dropped the coordinates of the location and  over two thousand customers show up to the location.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nIn 2023, Corteiz collaborated with Nike to release the Nike Air Max 95. The sneaker was released in three colorways, Gutta Green, Pink Beam and Aegean Storm, which were exclusively released in London, New York and Paris. The collaboration will also be rereleased in 2024.\nIn 2023, Corteiz collaborated with the streetwear brand Supreme, to launch a collection of t-shirts and hoodies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ma'dikarib Ya'fur (Arabic: معد كرب يعفر, romanized: Ma'dikarib Ya'fur) was a king of Himyar who reigned for six to seven years before Dhu Nuwas. Only two archaeological inscriptions mentioning him which date to the year 521 exist. In Arabian folklore, Ma'dikarib Ya'fur does not exist and is instead replaced by a person named Dhu Shanatir.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nMa'dikarib Ya'fur succeeded Marthad'ilan Yanuf, and he was also a Christian like his predecessor. He was appointed as the ruler of Himyar by the Aksumite Empire.\nDuring his reign, the Lakhmid ruler al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man led invasions against several Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula to assert his influence on the region; these tribes subsequently requested help from Ma'dikarib Ya'fur. In June 521, he and several Arab tribes including what remained of the Sabaeans marched against the Lakhmids. Syriac sources also mention that he loaned a large sum of dinars from a Najranite Christian merchant, Rahum bint Azma, due to a financial crisis the Himyarite Kingdom was suffering from at the time. He died in 521–522, and Dhu Nuwas took the throne after the sixth year of his rule. There is an inscription that attests to Ma'dikarib Ya'fur in Wadi Massal, 200 kilometres west of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Identification with Dhu Shanatir ==\n\nIn the Arabian legends, Dhu Shanatir is the king which precedes Dhu Nuwas, ruling for a period of 27 years after the death of Sharhabil Yafar. However, his name is not attested in the archeological inscriptions. Some scholars have suggested that Dhu Shanatir took up the throne name Ma'dikarib Ya'fur to resolve this. However Dhu Shanatir is described as being adherent to South Arabian polytheism, while Ma'dikarib Ya'fur was clearly a Christian.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDhu Shanatir\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Sena-Gahadavala Conflicts were a series of frequent expeditions of the Sena Dynasty into the dominions of the Gahadavala dynasty, after the death of the Gahadavala emperor Govindachandra.\n\n\n== Sena Expeditions on Gahadavala Dominions ==\n\n\n=== Lakshmana Sena's Early Campaigns ===\nThe Madhainagar inscription of Lakshmana states that as a prince he captured Gauda and then he defeated the king of Kashi, this suggests that he gained success during two occasions, one being as a prince, while another after his coronation.\n\n\n=== Sena Invasion of Magadha ===\nThe Gahadavala power in Magadha was a threat to the Senas, earlier Vallalasena's campaigns into magadha didn't carry much success but it was a short lived success which probably gave the Gahadavala power to annihilate the Pala power in Magadha. The struggle for power of Magadh which began during the reign of Vallalasena was continued by his successors, there's Lakshmana Sena managed to drive the Ghadavalas from Magadh and would later raid the heart dominions of the Ghadavalas.\n\n\n=== Sena invasion of Gaya ===\nThe King of Kashi, which is mentioned in the records of Lakshmana Sena, which clearly mentions the Gahadavala king and by putting a defeat upon the emperor he ousted the Gahadavala king from Magadha.The evidences of the Sena Conquest of Gaya comes from the two records of Ashokachalla found in Gaya.\nAlthough the correct interpretation of the dates is open to dispute but there is a general consensus of opinion that the expression used in these two records undoubtedly proves that Gaya was included within the dominions of Lakshmana Sena . Another notable mention is that the laudatory verse of Umapatidhara, referred to above, includes Magadha among the conquests of his hero, none can be more the more plausible hero than Lakshmana Sena here .The conquest of the Gaya region, if not the whole of Magadha, was evidently only the first stage in the successful campaign of Lakshmana Sena against Jayachandra. According to the interpretation of Asokachalla's records suggested later, the Gaya district remained in possession of Lakshmana Sena till it was it was captured by the Ghurids.\n\n\n=== Lakshmana Sena's Expedition of 1157-1158 ===\nLakshmana Sena shortly after his coronation led an expedition to the Gahadavala dominions, the temporary success of the Senas can be justified by the death of Govindachandra and the Ghurid invasions upon the Gahadavalas.\n\n\n=== Sena Raids on Benares and Allahabad ===\nThe planting of the pillars of victory in Benares and Allahabad, referred to in the records of Lakshmanasena's sons, represents the succeeding stages in the same campaign, which led him into the far Gahadavala dominions.His advance up to Benares and Allahabad was probably more likely of a  raid than a conquest. Which might have resulted in weakening of the Gahadavala power, and keeping him busy at a time when he required peace and his full strength to join the confederacy against the Ghurids.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite Lakshmana Sena's temporary success, Senas did not attempt for annexations of the dominions of the Ghadavalas however the Gahadavala kingdom suffered enormous setbacks and possibly their capital was occupied by the Sena forces.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Slivenski Mineralni Bani (Bulgarian: Сливенски минерални бани) is a spa resort of national importance in central Bulgaria. It is located on the territory of the village of Zlati Voyvoda in Sliven Municipality, Sliven Province. It lies on the second class II-66 road 12 km southeast of Sliven and 5 km northeast of Zlati Voyvida. The administrative status is that of a settlement entity of local importance as per a 2006 decision of the Sliven Municipal Council.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSlivenski Mineralni Bani is situated at an altitude of 245 m just south of the river Tundzha in the Sliven Valley between the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora. It is easily accessible via the first class I-6 and I-7 roads.\nThe climate is temperate continental with Mediterranean influence. Winter is moderately cold, summer is warm and autumn is long, sunny, dry and warmer than spring. The average temperature in January is in the range from −2 °C to 5 °C and in June — between 16 °C to 25 °C. The highest annual precipitation falls in May, reaching 171 mm.\n\n\n== Mineral springs ==\nThe mineral springs at Slivenski Mineralni Bani are two and spring from highly cracked and calcined Triassic limestone, covered by Late Cretaceous marl and tuff. They were captured as early as 1898. In 1957, a 90 m-deep borehole was drilled, which discovered self-flowing thermal waters. Further drills were conducted in 1961. The mineral springs have a total discharge of 18 L/sec and temperature of 48 °С.\nThe water has low mineralization (1.986 g/L) and is slightly fluorine (4.2 mg fluorine per liter) with sodium, calcium-sulfate and hydrocarbonate. It contains 27 mg of colloidal metasilicic acid per liter, but has a neutral reaction (pH 6.8) due to CO2 content (287 mg/L). The water contains over 19 minerals and has a broad prophylactic and healing effect. It has a general strengthening and anti-inflammatory effect on the body, improves blood circulation and removes toxins. It is suitable for the treatment of diseases of the musculoskeletal system, the peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal, biliary-hepatic and renal-urological diseases.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

Noir sur Blanc was\ncreated in Romandy, then in Paris in 1990 and Warsaw in 1991. One of the first texts published was Proust contre la déchéance, a short essay written by the painter Józef Czapski between 1940 and 1941 when a prisoner in the Starobyelsk camp in the Soviet Union.\nSubsequently, the (now married) couple acquired several publishing houses that were later brought together under the Lausanne-based holding group Libella. The holding now includes Noir sur Blanc, Les Éditions Phébus, Buchet-Chastel and Le Temps Apprivoisé, among others. They published in Polish books by Umberto Eco, Charles Bukowski, Henry Millar, Blaise Cendrars and many others. Polish authors, such as Sławomir Mrożek were translated into French and English and sold in their Librairie Polonaise book store, located on Boulevard Saint Germain in Paris, which still exists. Subsequently, in 2000, they founded the Libella editorial group.\n\n\n== Jan Michalski Foundation ==\nIn 2002, following the premature death of Jan Michalski at age 49, Hoffmann continued the project which resulted in the creation of the Jan Michalski Foundation in 2004. The Jan Michalski Foundation, inaugurated in 2013, offers a large multilingual book library of 80,000 volumes, an auditorium, an exhibition hall, a literary café and cabins used as writing residences. The foundation awards an annual prize, the Jan Michalski Prize for Literature.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFondation Jan Michalski",

It replaced a bridge next to it built 1896, considered too weak for increasing train weights and too low for electrification, which after 1957 is a narrow road bridge, still remaining as it was then. It is one of four railway bridges over this river.\n\n\n== Collapse in 2023 ==\nIn August 2023 the Randklev railway bridge collapsed during a flood, because a pillar in the river lost its foundation.\nAfter this repairs started. The pillars in the river have been replaced with new pillars. The truss was lifted to a place by the river by a crane capable of 1300 tonnes, where is being repaired. The bridge will accept railway traffic again in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe bridges carries the main line and only electrified railway between Oslo and Trondheim. When closed some freight trains and some passenger trains used the Røros Line, while most passengers were transported by bus past the bridge, and some freight carried by truck.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Norway\nList of bridges in Norway by length\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mina Fazel is a British psychiatrist, Professor of Adolescent Psychiatry and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford. Her research considers the mental health of children and young people, and how to design effective mental health interventions. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFazel studied medicine at the University of Cambridge, and completed her clinical training at the University of Oxford. She remained in Oxford for her specialist training in psychiatry.  She was a National Institute for Health and Care Research postdoctoral researcher, where she developed a mental health toolbox for front-line workers to use in educational institutions. \n\n\n== Research and career ==\nFazel is a Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Oxford Children's Hospital. She studies how to improve the mental health of children and young people, with a focus on child refugees. Her research group, Team Intervene, look to develop and deliver mental health interventions that benefit young people, and identify the barriers young people face when accessing mental health support.  At Oxford she coordinates the OxWell Student Survey, which she uses to assess the needs to students and to identify what type of support they find the most useful. Fazel coordinates data collection, analysis and reporting of the OxWell Student Survey. She explores how multiple adversities can impact young people's mental health, and the causes of school exclusions. MindKind, a Wellcome Trust programme led by Fazel, looked to create a global mental health databank. It encouraged young people with a smartphone to share information about their mental health. Her project Emotional Competence for Well-being (ECoWeB) create a mobile application to help young people understand their emotions.  \nShe has explored the epidemiology of mental health challenges in refugee children, and the psychological impacts of immigration detention. She has investigated narrative exposure therapy, which can be used to treat refugee children with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIn April 2024 Fazel was appointed Chair of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nMina Fazel; Jeremy Wheeler; John Danesh (1 April 2005). \"Prevalence of serious mental disorder in 7000 refugees resettled in western countries: a systematic review\".

        "content": "Haji Musa bin Haji Adnin or sometimes referred to as Haji Musa Adinin, is a Bruneian businessman and diplomat who became the first and only Mexican Honorary Consulate in Kuala Belait since 2000. Additionally, he is the managing director of Adinin Group (AG) of Companies since 1991, Adinin Works & Engineering (AWE), Straits Central Agencies and director of AEGIS Secure Solutions.  \n\n\n== Education and early life ==\nOut of eight children, Musa is the third. He received his education in Brunei, Singapore, and Malaysia. He obtained his experience through entrepreneurial pursuits and a broad range of domestic and international courses, seminars, and conferences on topics related to entrepreneurship, management, technology, health, safety, and the environment.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nMusa has been a manager and business owner since the 1980s. Along with these, he owns shares in a number of other businesses that are engaged in manufacturing, waste management, logistics, travel, marine vessel chartering, real estate, foodservice, education and training, engineering, procurement, onshore and offshore construction and commissioning (EPCC), IT solutions, and operation and maintenance. Along with two other people, Ahmad Morshidi and his cousin Ahmad Isa, he founded AEGIS Secure Solutions.\n\n\n=== Adinin Group ===\nHis father started carefully buying assets from foreign businesses who choose to leave the Sultanate as soon as Brunei gained independence in 1984. These assets were mostly in the hardware and petroleum services industries. Soon after Musa's graduation, he and his father jumped at the chance to take part in an initiative launched by the Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) and the Bruneian government to support regional companies. Due to Musa's perseverance and his father's negligence, the AG grew to include about 20 businesses that specialise in IT, tourism, advertisements, paint products and interior design. Together, they absorbed a number of sister companies that strengthen AG. Adnin gave over his position as the group's managing director to his son in the middle of the 1990s, at which point he took on the chairmanship.\nAG pledged to help the Bruneian government's efforts to stop the coronavirus from spreading throughout the nation by contributing B$200,000 to the COVID-19 Relief Fund, as given by its managing director Musa. In 2022, he stated that ASEAN need to enhance the lives of the rural population in ASEAN, safeguard the environment, and get ready for the digital future.\n\n\n=== Other positions ===\nIn addition, Musa holds the positions of Vice President of the National Chamber of Commerce & Industry's (NCCIBD) executive committee and Vice Chairman Il of the Brunei Darussalam Malay Chamber of Commerce & Industry's governance committee. He was named the ABAC's national representative, a member of the China-ASEAN Business Network for Brunei Darussalam and Universiti Brunei Darussalam's (UBD) council. In addition, he has the titles of first honorary president of the French Bruneian Business Association (FBBA) since 2005, first Honorary Consul of Mexico in Brunei Darussalam and the interim general manager of Anson International.\n\n\n== Personal views ==\nMusa highlighted that the official ratification of the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, which establishes the region's dedication to the expansion of the digital economy, and the ASEAN QR Code Financial Integration are supported by the business industry, including ASEAN Business Advisory Council (ABAC). To build confidence and draw investment, issues like cybersecurity and digital security are handled actively. Additionally, he stated that in order to embrace the economy of digital media, we must foster an innovative and cooperative culture that will propel Brunei toward an efficient technological future.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMusa is the son of the late businessman and nurse, Haji Adnin (1932–2023). He is also the grandson of the first Menteri Besar of Brunei, Pehin Dato Haji Ibrahim. As of 2021, he is married and has four children, including Muhammad Luqman Hakeem. \n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nMusa has earned the following honours;\n Order of Setia Negara Brunei Fourth Class (PSB; 2011)\n Meritorious Service Medal (PJK; 2006)\nASEAN BAC Legacy Award for Brunei Darussalam (6 September 2017)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Loin des yeux de l'Occident is the seventh studio album by French singer Daniel Balavoine, released in October 1983.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe album was another change in style for Balavoine, with the notable presence of synthesisers and programming. After listening to Peter Gabriel's latest album, he bought the revolutionary synthesiser Fairlight CMI and became one of the first French musicians to experiment with it. At his home in Colombes, he built a home studio, comprising the Fairlight as well as two other synthesisers, an Oberheim and a PPG Wave 2. He then spent several months experimenting with this technology before being ready to record the album.\nBalavoine chose to record at Strawberry Studios in Dorking due to its reputation and technical capabilities. He also moved recording to Highland Studios in Inverness for a change of scenery and due to its peacefulness.\nBalavoine also took inspiration, both musically and in the lyrics, from Africa. In 1983, he was invited to participate in the Paris-Dakar Rally as a co-driver. However, after breaking down in the first stage, he followed the rally in a caravan. This consequently opened his eyes to life in Africa, as he saw the poverty and famine there. Again, also inspired by the world music albums by Peter Gabriel, Balavoine made use of African percussion on the album.\nThe album covers a range of different topics, which Balavoine described as being a succession of ideas, meaning that there isn't a unifying theme or concept to the album. The only link on the album is that Balavoine wrote the lyrics to one song per day according to a strict schedule so he did not spend hours trying to perfect each song.\nThe first single released from the album was \"Pour la femme veuve qui s'éveille\", released in October 1983. The song criticises the living conditions of women (the song refers to widowed women) caused by war and policies and how they have to continue on and be the pillars of their families. First of all, he makes reference to a woman in China having to work to feed her sons, implicitly criticising the one-child policy that had been introduced there in 1970. The song then goes on to reference the labour camps in the USSR and then the Maasai people in Africa. \n\"Les petits lolos\" was released as the second single in February 1984 and describes a man's attraction to teenage girls, similar to Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.\nElsewhere on the album, \"Supporter\" looks at friendship and affection through the theme of football, and \"Poisson dans la cage\" looks at the effects of a drug overdose. \"Partir avant les miens\" looks at his death and burial before those close to him so he doesn't have to deal with the pain of losing them. This is prophetic given that less than three years later, Balavoine died in a helicopter accident. Two songs look at torture in South America: the first, \"Frappe avec ta tête\" was dedicated to pianist Miguel Ángel Estrella and tells the story of a writer who, after having his fingers cut off and his tongue cut out, the only way to express himself is to hit with his head. The second, \"Revolución\" describes the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo in Argentina who demonstrated against the disappearance of their children and those close to them during the country's military dictatorship, National Reorganization Process.  \nLoin des yeux de l'Occident was re-released in 1989, and along with it a remixed version of \"Frappe avec ta tête\" was released as a single. \n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nDaniel Balavoine – vocals, backing vocals (1, 3, 5–9), keyboards (4, 8), piano (4, 8)\nAlain Pewzner – guitar, backing vocals (1, 3, 5–9)\nYves Chouard – guitar, backing vocals (4, 9)\nChristian Padovan – bass, backing vocals (1, 3, 5–9)\nPatrick Moraz – keyboards (6)\nPhilippe Patron – keyboards, backing vocals (1)\nJean-Hervé Limeretz – keyboards\nJoe Hammer – drums, percussion, backing vocals (1, 3, 5–9)\nJean-Paul Batailley – percussion\nRon Aspery – saxophone\nTechnical\n\nDaniel Balavoine – producer, artwork\nAndy Scott – producer, engineer\nBen Kape – engineer\nLéo Missir – executive producer, supervisor\nJean-Paul Théodule – artwork\nGérard Rancinan – photography\nPatrick Cosse – photography\nRichard Schroeder – photography\nSygma – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

The match was in round 11 of the Maryborough Castlemaine District Football League (MCDFL) season, and saw the highest ever score in a senior Australian rules football match, with Campbells Creek winning by 616 points.\nAlthough this is the highest senior score, a 1983 Victorian Football Association thirds match saw Williamstown defeat Geelong West 110.27 (687) to 2.0 (12) − the highest score in any grade.\n\n\n== Match summary ==\nRuck-rover Reg 'Butch' Sartori kicked Campbells Creek's 100th goal (and his 18th of the day) with 20 seconds left in the match.\nSartori led the goalkickers, with forward pocket Craig Ginnivan (father of future Collingwood and Hawthorn player Jack Ginnivan) kicking 17, half-forward flanker Kelly Stevens kicking 14, while centre half-forward Alister McGibbon and half-forward flanker Craig Pietsch both had 13 goals each.\nAll of Primrose's three goals game in the final quarter.\nBecause of time-on due to the amount of goals, the match is believed to have gone for 3 hours and 5 minutes.\n\n\n=== Scoreboard ===\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nCampbells Creek again heavily defeated Primrose three years later in 1993, kicking 76.43 (499), which itself is the third-highest Victorian senior score.\nPrimrose folded the following year in 1994.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWilliamstown vs Geelong West (1983 VFA season)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The mass media is recognised as playing a significant role in the war on terror, both in regard to perpetuating and shaping particular understandings of the motivations of the United States and its allies in undertaking the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq, as well as sustaining cultural perceptions of the global threat from terrorism in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\nPolitical theorist Richard Jackson argues that \"the 'war on terrorism' [...] is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse\". Jackson notes that such political discourses only rise to prominence when other social actors, like the media, reproduce the language across wider society and that, following the September 11 attacks, the media reproduced official discourse \"in a relatively unmediated fashion, while at the same time silencing and marginalising alternative narratives\".\nSimilarly, David Holloway states the \"idea of a war on terror was itself a representation of events, a rhetorical construction, a series of stories about 9/11 and about America's place in the world\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe war on terror, officially the Global War on Terrorism, is a global military campaign initiated by the United States following the September 11 attacks. The main targets of the campaign are militant Islamist movements like Al-Qaeda, Taliban and their allies. Other major targets included the Ba'athist regime in Iraq, which was deposed in an invasion in 2003, and various militant factions that fought during the ensuing insurgency.\nIn October 2001, an Entertainment Industry Task Force was secretly formed, bringing together prominent Hollywood figures with high-level military members, to discuss potential attack scenarios in the hope these might expose vulnerabilities in the US's counterterrorism capabilities. According to attendee James Korris, several scenarios that were posited in these meetings ended up in films.\nA month later, in November, Hollywood executives met with George W. Bush's senior advisor Karl Rove, to discuss entertainment industry cooperation in the war on terror, though Rove denied the government intended to shape the content of movies or television shows specifically.\nIn the music industry, however, a number of instances did demonstrate explicit curtailment of content. For example, the Clear Channel memorandum was a list of songs among US radio stations deemed \"questionable\" following the September 11 attacks, with the suggestion that stations did not play them.\n\n\n== Media framing of the war on terror ==\nResearchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the \"war on terror\" is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict. Jim A. Kuypers illustrates how \"the press failed America in its coverage on the war on terror\". Kuypers labelled the mainstream news media an \"anti-democratic institution\" in its uncritical approach to the administration's discursive framing of the war. Indeed, studies of corporate news coverage of the September 11 attacks demonstrated the extent to which the media contributed to a significant narrowing of public discourse by neglecting to provide an outline of the wider political motivations of the attackers.\nDouglas Kellner identified the post-September 11 media coverage's \"exceptionally impoverished understanding of the historical context of terrorism and war\". Jackson concurs, stating the media responded to the attacks \"with a great deal of patriotism, self-censorship, oversensitivity to public opinion and deference to authority\".\nOthers have suggested press coverage contributed to public confusion and misinformation about both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. Ian Lustick claims the media \"have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response\". Lustick alleges the war on terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized war on terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, before taking on a life of its own, fueled by such media coverage. Similarly, Scott Atran writes that \"publicity is the oxygen of terrorism\" and that rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that \"perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many\".\nLooking at the role of online bloggers in resisting and countering official narratives about the war, Stephen D. Cooper analysed several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the war on terror. He observed four key points:\n\nMainstream reporting of the war on terror has frequently contained factual inaccuracies. In some cases, the errors go uncorrected: moreover, when corrections are issued they usually are given far less prominence than the initial coverage containing the errors\nThe mainstream press has sometimes failed to check the provenance of information or visual images supplied by Iraqi \"stringers\" (local Iraqis hired to relay local news)\nStory framing is often problematic: in particular, \"man-in-the-street\" interviews have often been used as a representation of public sentiment in Iraq, in place of methodologically sound survey data\nMainstream reporting has tended to concentrate on the more violent areas of Iraq, with little or no reporting of the calm areas\n\n\n== Media influenced by the war on terror ==\nSome scholars have observed the way in which the war on terror shapes terrorism in the public social imaginary. Holloway looks at narratives of trauma relating to the September 11 attacks, arguing how the saturation, repetition and amplification of the events in the media in the weeks after underscored the extent to which \"journalists themselves helped construct the event as trauma\".\nMichael Frank notes the public discourse on terrorism, particularly sub-state, has \"spawned numerous terrorist plots in literature and film\". He explores the way in which literary and cinematic narratives overlap with wider discourse on terrorism, arguing both draw on and contribute to a common imaginary. In the process, he argues, \"the discursive boundary between the factual and the non-factual can become difficult to discern, as public discourse both feeds on, and feeds back into, fiction – and vice versa\". Observing how \"terrorism systematically exploits the anticipatory nature of fear\", Frank observes how the imaginary of terrorism may premeditate events in the world, shaping expectations and the construction of meaning.\nLikewise, Holloway writes that - from the start - the events of September 11 and subsequent 'war on terror' became so indivisible from their representations in political rhetoric, mass media spectacle, as well as films, novels, photographs, paintings, and TV dramas, that they came to feel pervasive. He notes the \"rapid accommodation of modish post-9/11 themes within established drama series\" like ER and The West Wing and proliferation of new television dramas incorporating the same themes.\n\nCataloguing a series of allegorical references to the attacks in movies like The Village and War of the Worlds, he shows how the latter in particular tapped into and exploited popular anxiety, simultaneously reproducing it as a \"palpable and insistent reality in everyday life\". He notes the film's multiple signposted references to the September 11 attacks:A panicked crowd in a city street fled a gigantic debris cloud. An aeroplane crashed into a house, leaving bits of its undercarriage prominently displayed to the camera in the wreckage. American refugees flooded roads usually choked with vehicles, while collages of photos and cards mounted on streetlamps, hydrants and booths showed images of the 'missing'. Other scenes evoked the horror of 9/11 more allusively. Corpses drifted down the Hudson River. The white ash remains of pulverised buildings and human bodies, and the empty clothes of dead Americans, floated from the sky.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Orlando Jeremias Gomes (17 January 1925 – 5 August 2003), was an Indian theatre critic and writer known for his work on the Konkani stage. While employed by The Times of India, he contributed to English and Konkani language publications such as Evening News, The Goa Times, Gulab, and The Goan Review. His contributions included previews, reviews, and free advertisements of Konkani tiatrs.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOrlando Jeremias Gomes was born on 17 January 1925 in his ancestral Gomes building, Vijaywadi (formerly Dukhorwadi), Chira Bazaar, Bombay, which was part of Bombay Presidency during British India (now Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), into a Goan Catholic family. Gomes' ancestral roots can be traced back to Gomes Vaddo in Majorda, Salcete, Goa, then part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire (now located in India). His father, Joao Francisco Gomes, hailed from the village of Majorda, whereas his mother, Maria Paula Estifania Rodrigues, hailed from the coastal village of Anjuna, Goa. \nDespite his birth in Bombay, Gomes' birth was later registered in his parents' home state of Goa in 1949. From an early age, Gomes developed a deep appreciation for tiatrs, a form of Goan musical theater. He had a clear recollection of the well-known tiatrists from previous times and their commitment to the Konkani theater. Gomes pursued his education in Bombay, completing both his schooling and graduation there.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGomes embarked on his professional journey in the advertising department of The Times of India publications subsequent to his education in Bombay. Ascending the ranks, he eventually assumed the position of senior advertisement officer before retiring. Gomes harbored an affinity for tiatr, a form of Goan musical theater, and undertook a significant role in its propagation within Bombay. Through his critical assessments and advance coverage of tiatrs in The Times of India and Evening News, he introduced the art form to a broader audience, extending beyond the Goan community. During the zenith of the tiatr movement, spanning from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, Gomes made substantial contributions to the advancement and popularity of Konkani tiatrs in Bombay. He upheld an inclusive stance, supporting both commercial and non-commercial tiatrs, as well as related forms like khell-tiatrs and non-stop shows. Gomes exhibited impartiality, refraining from discriminating between various genres. In his assessment of Goan art, he showed a positive interest while maintaining an impartial stance, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of tiatrs and khell-tiatrs in a manner that appealed to a broad range of viewers. Leveraging his position as a member of the staff of the English daily in India, The Times of India, Gomes strategically utilized his influence to bolster the Konkani tiatr scene.\nGomes played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Man of the Year award, an annual accolade presented to the outstanding tiatr performance held in Bombay for a period of time. This recognition was made possible through the collaborative efforts of influential figures such as Murli Deora, the former Mayor of Bombay and ex-Congress MP, and Nolasco da Gama, a former Goan corporator in Bombay. Gomes, in addition to his involvement with tiatr, made contributions as a writer, regularly contributing articles on tiatrs and various other Goan subjects of interest to Konkani publications including The Goa Times, Gulab, and The Goan Review. Beyond Gomes, there existed a cadre of journalists who undertook the regular review of tiatrs. Among these individuals were those who not only reviewed the scripted and directed performances but also displayed their acting prowess. Their multifaceted involvement played a significant role in the advancement of tiatr. Among these influential figures were Dr. Simon C. Fernandes, Evagrio Jeorge, Elliot de Elly, Anthony Fernandes, Zito Almeida, Ervell Menezes, Alfred D'Cruz, John Gomes (Kokoy), and Fr. Lactancio Almeida SFX, among others. The contributions of these artists to the evolution of tiatr have been documented in the 125th Tiatr Commemorative Volume book. Writer Wilson Mazarello aptly acknowledged Gomes' dedication to the Konkani tiatr in his capacity as a journalist for the English newspaper, The Times of India, stating that his contributions surpassed those of any other individual during that time.\nGomes played a significant role in bolstering the presence and reputation of tiatrs in Bombay's theatrical landscape. His contributions were inclusive and impartial, extending support to both established and aspiring actors, as well as to tiatrists and khell-tiatrists alike. Gomes' assiduity to the Konkani stage was evident through his proactive efforts, such as organizing previews, securing free advertisements, and generating favorable reviews for these performances. His influence transcended regional boundaries, as his previews and reviews served as a gateway for non-Goans to discover and appreciate the Konkani tiatr. In his writings, Gomes exhibited a marked positive inclination towards this form of theater, ensuring that his previews were filled with enthusiasm and his reviews offered constructive criticism. His goal was to highlight the tiatr's strengths while providing suggestions to address any shortcomings, all delivered in a manner that was respectful and non-detrimental. Author Wilson Mazarello aptly noted Gomes' affection for the Konkani tiatr, emphasizing that his previews and reviews consistently reflected this sentiment. As of 1995, despite retiring from The Times of India, Gomes continued to support his cause by collaborating with the media to offer insights and critiques for every tiatr performance in Bombay.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGomes was an advocate and enthusiast of the Konkani tiatr, a theatrical art form. He displayed an ardor for the genre and actively contributed to its development and welfare. Gomes willingly extended his support and guidance to aspiring tiatrists, offering them insights into the ethical aspects of pursuing a successful stage career. Gomes was also an admirer of several tiatrists, who were performers in the Goan traditional theatre form known as tiatr. In 1995, Gomes resided with his family in Vijaywadi, situated off Girgaum Road in Bombay. On 5 August 2003, Gomes died at the age of 78 in his ancestral Gomes building located in Chira Bazaar, Mumbai.\n\n\n== References ==",

Currently most of the territory that comprised that region is known as Rioja Alavesa, although this has lost, by its current administrative delimitation, other municipalities that historically and geographically formed a whole one with the current wine region.\nThe name Sonsierra derives from the term subserra, already mentioned by the monks of the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla in the 12th century.\nFor more than five centuries it formed a region within the merindad of Estella, of the ancient kingdom of Navarre that included the towns of San Vicente, Laguardia, Labraza, Viana and all their villages.\n\n\n== Territorial division ==\nCurrently its enclaves belong to three different autonomous communities, but during medieval times and until the beginning of the Renaissance, they were a socio-geographical and even administrative unit, from its beginnings called \"comunidad de villa y tierra\" until its last dates under the denomination of principality of Viana.\n\n\n=== Geographical demarcation ===\nThe geographical limits are clearly defined in the north by the Toloño or Cantabria mountain range, from the shells of Haro in the west to the Linares river in the east, in the south and west by the Ebro river, and in the east by the valley of the Linares river in the municipalities of Bargota and Lazagurría to the border between Viana and Mendavia, opposite the mouth of the Leza river in the Ebro.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First written references ===\nIn 934 the Castilian Count Fernán González granted the document known as the \"false vows of Fernán González\". Within the extensive list of inhabited nuclei cited in the document, some place names that could be considered the first data that appear in a written document in medieval times about these lands can be found: \"Tabuerneca, tota Subserra, tota Berrocia, Marangone, Punicastro, Moreta...\". The term \"Subserra\" also appears in the document that contains the confirmation of the Charter of Nájera that King Alfonso VI of Castile made in the year 1076.\n\n\n=== Community of \"Villa y Tierra\" ===\n\nIn its beginnings, this region was called \"La Guardia\" since in 1164 Sancho VI of Navarre gave a charter to the town of Laguardia and marked its jurisdiction between Salinillas de Buradón, to the west, and the Soto de Íñigo Galíndez (today known as Soto Galindo in Viana), to the east. The northern and southern limits are marked by the Cantabria mountains and the Ebro River respectively. The conflicts of the Navarrese king with Castile meant that in a few years, the Ebro river valley had new towns. Thus, in 1172 San Vicente de la Sonsierra de Navarra was founded, in 1195 a foundation charter was granted to San Cristóbal de Labraza, and in 1219 the first stone was laid for the concentration of towns in Viana.\n\n\n=== Charters granted by the kings of Navarre ===\nThe charters of these four towns are a copy, if possible improved, of the charter of Logroño, a town granted to its inhabitants by King Alfonso VI of León in 1095.\nIn 1164 Sancho VI of Navarre gave a charter to the town of Laguardia.\nAlso Sancho \"the Wise\" in 1172 granted the charter of Laguardia to San Vicente de la Sonsierra.\nHis successor, Sancho VII granted a charter to the town of Labraza, renaming it San Cristóbal de Labraza, in September 1196.\nIn February 1219, Sancho VII \"the Strong\" re-founded Viana, granting it a charter.\nThe Castilian Ferdinand III granted the Charter of La Bastida in 1242.\n\n\n=== Demography in the Sonsierra around the second quarter of the 15th century ===\nAround 1427 the town with the largest number of houses was Laguardia with 444, followed by San Vicente with 379 and Viana, with 349 houses. Grouped by villas plus their hamlets, Laguardia had 1906 houses, San Vicente 554, Labraza 55 and Viana 437. This must have been a very bloody period, both because of battles and the Black Death, since of the total of 2,138 houses in the four villas, only 1,014 were inhabited.\n\n\n=== Principality of Viana ===\nIn 1423 the Navarrese King Charles III the Noble established the principality of Viana, which included the whole of the Sonsierra of Navarre as well as other places. Shortly after, during the civil wars of Navarre, a part of this principality fell into Castilian hands, never to return to the Pyrenean kingdom again.\n\n\n=== End of Navarrese rule ===\nIn 1461, Henry IV, cousin and brother-in-law of the Prince of Viana, helped the latter to recover the throne of Navarre; he obtained the surrender of Laguardia, San Vicente, Viana and Los Arcos, which Gonzalo Saavedra occupied with the Castilian army. In the arbitral sentence of Bayonne, of Louis XI of France, in April of 1463, to settle the questions arisen between Castile and Aragon, the Sonsierra and the party of Los Arcos, were in pledge to no longer return to the crown of Navarre the first of them while Los Arcos would take almost four centuries (until 1753).\nIn 1462, the Count of Foix, husband of Doña Leonor in Navarre, taking advantage of the Castilian crisis, seized Calahorra and tried to penetrate into Alfaro, to demand the return of Los Arcos and the Sonsierra; he arrived at the gates of Alfaro without success and finally had to evacuate Calahorra.\nIn 1466, Enrique IV ordered the inhabitants of the Sonsierra to accede to the Brotherhood of Álava to fight against the thieves and thieves that took refuge, jumping to this part from Álava.\nAlthough the kings of Navarre repeatedly claimed the lands of the Sonsierra from Don Enrique and later from Isabella and Ferdinand, not only they, but all of Navarre, would be occupied by Ferdinand in 1512 and annexed to the crown of Castile.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and the end of the border line ===\nAfter the Castilian conquest and the last attempts of reconquest by the Navarrese monarch, from 1521 the region enjoyed a long period of peace, since the border was moved to the Pyrenees. From then on, the towns underwent transformations that modified the defensive character with which they were born, towards another more oriented to the economy, where the cultivation of the vine and the passage of the road to Santiago marked the new orientation of the populations. From the 16th century onwards, vineyards and wine, together with olive oil, clearly marked the economy of the region, and the name by which the region was known began to decline and was superseded by the more commonly used names of La Rioja and Rioja Alavesa for the western part, and Tierra Estella or Vianaldea for the Navarrese part.\n\n\n=== Rioja in the 18th century ===\n\nIn some maps published on behalf of the Academy of San Fernando in Madrid, such as one drawn up by Tomás López in 1769, La Rioja appears. In it, La Rioja Alavesa is mentioned, together with its denomination of Sonsierra de Navarra.\nAccording to the map: Map of La Rioja divided into Upper and Lower Rioja, with the part of the Sonsierra, which is commonly called Rioja Alavesa. The territory covered by the map was, at that time, assigned to the intendancies of Burgos, Soria and Álava, as a result of the administrative division of Spain into intendancies carried out by Floridablanca in the 18th century.\nIn the northeastern part, it is shown as bordering the kingdom of Navarre, since it remained as such, under the Hispanic Monarchy, governed by a viceroy until 1841, when it was considered just another province. It should also be noted that this map should not be considered a political map of La Rioja, since this region was not given a provincial administrative framework until 1821, and was given its current demarcation in 1833. It should also be noted that the aforementioned map of Tomás López was criticized by illustrious people of the time for having several inaccuracies, such as not including some parts of the region of La Rioja.\n\n\n=== Provincial division in the first decades of the 19th century ===\nAt the end of the 18th century, the first complaints began to be heard about the situation in which La Rioja found itself and voices began to be heard demanding, in their own words, the administrative reunification of La Rioja region, with the creation of a province for it. These came especially from the Sociedad Riojana, which was a society of friends of the country, from the Junta de Rioja, made up of representatives of the municipalities of La Rioja, and from enlightened Riojanos of the time such as Martín Fernández de Navarrete. They demanded that La Rioja should be united with the establishment of boundaries equal to those that the ancient inhabitants of this land had known before the different administrative divisions of the Spanish State took place from the middle of the 18th century onwards, with the creation of the intendancies and the consequent division of La Rioja region into several of them. These claims had a clear identity component. In order to achieve the union, various arguments were put forward, such as those presented by the enlightened Martín Fernández de Navarrete in his Carta de un riojano a un señor diputado en cortes, which argued ethnographic, economic, geographic and historical criteria.\n\nThus, in 1821 it was proposed to modify the provincial distribution of the Spanish State and, due to the claims of La Rioja, a province was formed for La Rioja, to be called \"province of La Rioja\", which would also include all the Sonsierra of Navarre, including Viana and La Rioja Alavesa. However, the proposed division of the Spanish State remained without effect due to the absolutist reaction of Ferdinand VII and the situation returned to the previous one. In 1822, during the liberal triennium, the creation of a province for the Rioja region was again proposed, this time to be called the province of Logroño due to the obligation to give each province the name of its capital and in which the whole of the Navarrese Sonsierra was also included. However, in 1833 the boundaries of the province were rectified to leave them as are known today.\n\n\n== Current administrative division ==\nThe lands of the former Sonsierra of Navarre are currently divided into three Autonomous Communities:\n\nBelonging to the Basque Country are the population centers of: Assa, Baños de Ebro, Barriobusto, Cripán, Elciego, Elvillar, Labastida, Labraza, Laguardia, Lanciego, Lapuebla de Labarca, Leza, Laserna, Moreda, Navaridas, Oyón, Páganos, Salinillas de Buradón, Samaniego, Villabuena, Viñaspre, Yécora.\nBelong to La Rioja: Ábalos, Briñas, Peciña, Rivas de Tereso and San Vicente de la Sonsierra.\nBelong to Navarra: Aras, Bargota, Lapoblación, Lazagurria, Meano and Viana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCarrasco Pérez, Juan (1992). \"El Principado de Viana\".

        "content": "Bhutan does not recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions. A gender-neutral marriage bill was under discussion in the Parliament of Bhutan in 2018, but has since stalled.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBhutan decriminalised same-sex sexual relations in 2021. Legislation to this effect passed the Parliament of Bhutan in December 2020, and received royal assent and came into force in February 2021. This was hailed as a \"big stride forward\" for LGBT rights in Bhutan. The Himal Southasian reported in November 2023 that \"these two developments [the other being the crowning of Tashi Choden as Miss Bhutan in 2022] have encouraged [LGBT] Bhutanese, making them feel seen, recognised and included in a country where traditional values had earlier rendered them largely invisible. The community now hopes to capitalise on the momentum of the last few years to campaign for marriage equality, legal gender recognition and other crucial protections.\" Activists had hoped that Supriyo v. Union of India, a court case seeking to legalise same-sex marriage in India at the Indian Supreme Court, would \"bring a positive outcome that would also nudge Bhutan in the right direction.\" However, the court dismissed the case as a matter for the Parliament to decide. Nevertheless, activists hope that \"formal dialogue among community bodies and policymakers [...] will help bring clarity on issues like marriage equality\".\n\n\n== Legal situation ==\nBhutanese laws do not provide for same-sex marriages or other form of relationship recognition such as civil unions or domestic partnerships. The Marriage Act of Bhutan, 1980 (Dzongkha: གཉེན་འབྲེལ་གྱི་ཁྲིམས་ཡིག ༡༩༨༠, gnyen 'brel gyi khrims yig 1980) states that \"a person has the right to marry any other person, irrespective of status, caste, wealth or appearance, provided the persons contracting the marriage thereof have expressly consented to their marriage.\" However, the Act generally refers to married spouses as \"man and wife\". It states that to receive a marriage license the couple \"shall have to present before the Court as sureties a male person for the bridegroom and a female person for the bridge\". If no provisions are contravened, then the couple \"shall be recognised as a man and wife\". The Constitution of Bhutan does not explicitly address marriage or same-sex marriage, but states that \"the State shall endeavour to promote those conditions that are conducive to co-operation in community life and the integrity of the extended family structure.\"\nA marriage bill with gender-neutral language was discussed during the 2018 summer parliamentary session, but was deferred due to the 2018 parliamentary election. A progressive government led by Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa was elected in that election, and LGBT activists expressed their belief that the conversation around the bill would be revived. However, no discussion on the bill took place before the 2023–24 election. Due to their inability to marry under Bhutanese law, same-sex couples do not enjoy the rights, benefits, obligations and responsibilities of marriage, notably they are not permitted to adopt, to inherit or to enjoy marital tax benefits.\nWhen asked by a reporter in September 2022 if repealing the articles that criminalised same-sex sexual relations would be \"only the first step\", Prime Minister Lotay Tshering responded that \"now, everything will be easier.\", including same-sex marriage. MP Dorji Khandu was also vocal about the legalization of same-sex marriage during discussions on the bill decriminalizing homosexuality.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBT rights in Bhutan\nRecognition of same-sex unions in Asia\nRecognition of same-sex unions in India\nSame-sex marriage in Nepal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sanja Miladinović (Serbian Cyrillic: Сања Миладиновић; born 8 November 1980) is a Serbian politician. She was the president (i.e., speaker) of the Merošina municipal assembly in 2012 and served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2022 to 2024. Miladinović is a member of the Democratic Party (DS).\n\n\n== Private career ==\nMiladinović has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in education and has worked as a primary school teacher. She is the author of the book, Ekološko obrazovanje u osnovnoj školi (English: Environmental Education in Primary School).\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\n\n=== Local politics in Merošina (2004–2020) ===\nThe 2004 Serbian local elections resulted in an extremely fragmented local assembly in Merošina, with the municipality's thirty-seven seats being divided among ten political groupings. The Democratic Party won two seats and afterward participated in the local coalition government. Miladinović was one of her party's assembly representatives. Available online sources do not confirm the point, but is likely that she served a second term following the 2008 local elections, in which the DS won three seats in the municipality.\nThe Democratic Party won eight seats in Merošina in the 2012 local elections, finishing a close second against the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). The SPS, DS, and United Regions of Serbia (URS) formed a coalition government after the election, and Miladinović, who was by this time the leader of the local DS organization, became speaker of the assembly. Her term in office was relatively short; in December 2012, a new local coalition of the URS and the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) came to power, and she was removed as speaker by a vote of twenty-one to fifteen. The local government remained unstable, and the DS briefly returned to power in April 2016 in coalition with a dissident group of local Progressives.\nMiladinović led the DS's electoral list for Merošina the 2016 local elections and was re-elected when the party won two seats. The Serbian Progressive Party formed a new government after the election, and the DS served in opposition. Her term ended in August 2019, when the local assembly was dissolved and an interim administration was established.\nThe DS and other opposition parties began boycotting Serbia's political institutions in 2019, charging that the Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić and the SNS were undermining the country's democratic foundations. The DS did not participate in the 2020 Serbian local elections.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian (2022–24) ===\nMiladinović appeared in the 159th position on the Democratic Party's Choice for a Better Life list in the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election. This was too low a position for election to be a realistic prospect, and she was not elected when the list won sixty-seven seats. She later appeared in the seventy-second position on the DS's list in the 2014 parliamentary election and the 125th position in the 2016 parliamentary election; the party's coalitions won nineteen and sixteen seats in these elections, respectively, and she was again not elected. The DS boycotted the 2020 parliamentary election.\nFor the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election, the DS joined United for the Victory of Serbia, a broad coalition of opposition parties. Miladinović appeared in the forty-fifth position on the coalition's list and was not immediately elected when the coalition won thirty-eight mandates. She was, however, awarded a mandate on 25 October 2022 as a replacement for Olivera Lazović, who had resigned. Her term formally began the following day. The SNS and its allies won the 2022 election, and Miladinović served in opposition. She was the only delegate from Merošina in this sitting of the assembly and one of a comparatively small number of delegates from the south of Serbia generally. After receiving a mandate, she said that she would advocate for decentralization, the direct election of mayors, an end to closed list proportional representation, the annulment of a recent decision to shut down the JKP Hammeum in Prokuplje, and an end to the \"alienation\" of Niš's airport. She was the leader of Serbia's parliamentary friendship group with South Sudan.\nMiladinović was not a candidate in the 2023 parliamentary election, and her term ended when the new assembly convened in February 2024.\n\n\n=== Return to local politics (2023–present) ===\nMiladinović led the Democratic Party's electoral list for Merošina in the 2023 Serbian local elections and was elected when the party won four mandates. The SNS and its allies won the election, and the DS serves in opposition.\nIn early 2024, Miladinović played a leading role in re-establishing a local branch of the Democratic Party in Niš.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Burn Bullock is former public house in Mitcham, in the London Borough of Merton, England (at the time of its construction, the area was part of the county of Surrey). Parts of the building are thought to date to the 16th century. It was badly damaged by fire in April 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe King's Head Hotel was built as a  coaching inn. \nThe Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers was founded in the pub in 1953.\nIt was Grade II listed in 1954, giving it legal protection from unauthorised alteration or demolition.\nIn 1975 the pub was renamed for its former manager, the cricketer Burnett Bullock, who ran it from 1941 to 1954.\nThe pub was closed in September 2009 because of ongoing anti-social behaviour. Around that time, it was sold for £450,000 to Phoenix GRP Investments Ltd., a newly-formed company.\nIn 2014, concerns were raised abut the building's use by squatters. The same year, it was added to Historic England's \"Heritage at Risk Register\".\nOn 19 April 2024, the empty building was badly damaged by fire. The fire was attended by twelve fire appliances, including a 32-metre turntable ladder, and about 80 firefighters.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe three-storey building's entry on the National Heritage List for England notes its features as including a five-bay front built in the early to mid 18th century, using yellow brick with red dressings, with a wing built in the 16th or 17th century, featuring panelling from the same era. The front has a central doric porch and sash windows with glazing bars. The second and fourth windows of the upper floor are blind.\n\n\n== Nearby ==\nAdjacent to the pub is Mitcham Cricket Club's pavilion, which is under the same ownership as the pub. Unusually, the pavilion and the club's ground are separated by a road.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Teemu Tanner (b. 1985) is a Finnish former indie rock singer and guitarist living in Helsinki.\nBands and TV Appearances\nTanner has been the frontman for bands like Kynnet and Hopeajärvi. He has also been part of bands such as The Munchies, Lady Escape, Love Sport, and Teksti-TV 666. Tanner has appeared on the Yleisradio television show Sohvaperunat. In 2017, Tanner was fined for defamation after calling Pertti Nykänen of the Suomi Ensin movement a racist while Nykänen was filming the band's performance at the Vantaa Tikkurila Block Party.\nSexual Assault Allegations and Rape Conviction\nTanner announced in the fall of 2021 that he would be ending his career due to the controversy surrounding him on Instagram's Punkstoo channel, where he was accused of sexual violence. It involved unprotected intercourse without consent, which Tanner himself confessed to and announced he would stop performing. Additionally, Love Sport's former bandmate Max Mäkinen revealed Tanner's manipulative behavior. Charges were brought against Tanner for sexual assault in the Helsinki District Court in the summer of 2023. In March of the following year, Tanner was convicted of rape and sentenced to one year of probation, and ordered to pay the victim €2,000 in compensation for mental suffering.",

        "content": "Secours catholique (French for \"Catholic relief\"), also known as Secours catholique - Caritas France, is a French not-for-profit organisation. It works to alleviate problems of poverty and exclusion of all sections of the population and seeks to promote social justice. Secours catholique is a service of the Catholic Church in France.\nIt is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis.\n\n\n== History ==\nSecours catholique was established in 1946 on the occasion of the Lourdes pilgrimage, with the return of 100,000 prisoners and deportees. It was founded by the French priest Jean Rodhain, former chaplain to prisoners of war, with the approval of the Assembly of Cardinals and Archbishops of France. His goal was to work with volunteers to support persons experiencing poverty without distinction of race, religion or nationality. In 1954, the organisation created its first \"Cité\" providing accommodation for the workers from Maghreb. Later, many other such establishments were created for people in precarious situations, the homeless, disabled people and migrants.\nIn 1962, Secours catholique received the \"reconnu d'utilité publique\" status (recognised as being of public interest) which brought with it certain advantages related to donations.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, in the context of rising unemployment and new precariousness, Secours Catholique urged the public authorities to initiate social justice policies to combat the causes of poverty.\nSince then, the organisation has also provided national and international support to the people impacted by large scale emergencies in France and abroad, including to the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the most vulnerable persons impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the Ukrainian refugees arriving in France after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Structure and work ==\nIn France, Secours Catholique covers the whole country through to its 3,500 local teams divided into 72 local offices called \"delegations\". It carries out its activities with the help of 900 employees and 59,000 volunteers.\nIn addition to its work in France, Secours catholique also work internally by supporting the development cooperation and humanitarian relief efforts of its partners organisations around the world. The organisation is one of the NGO partners of DG ECHO.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Website (in French)\n\n\n== References ==",

It was common practice to add leather to make a weapon's handle. Jawbone war club's were delicately painted in symbols, these symbols referenced tribal significance. Despite jawbone war club being a relatively primitive weapon, it was considered highly effective. In pre-historic times, jawbone war club were used all over North America. The weapon was primarily for close combat, and was able to penetrate through enemy's chest.

        "content": "The 2024–25 Australian federal budget will be delivered on budget night at 7:30pm on Tuesday, 14 May 2024 by Treasurer Jim Chalmers. The budget will dictate how the Australian Government will allocate an estimated A$715 billion across the federal government, and to state and territory governments. It will be the third federal budget handed down by the Labor Party since their victory in the 2022 Australian federal election.\nWhile the exact details of the federal budget have not yet been released, the consultation period described the budget as focused on support for Australians and creating a \"stronger, more inclusive and more sustainable economy\" with several individual items announced. It is expected that the budget will provide a surplus for the second year in a row.\n\n\n== Pre-budget ==\n\n\n=== Predictions and commentary ===\nWith global inflation decreasing and markets stabilising, the ABC predicts that the budget will focus less on mitigating the impacts of inflation and instead address \"trouble in China, sluggish growth, and the ever-present pressures on government spending.\" All three 'threats' to the budget have been raised by the International Monetary Fund, with a property-driven slow-down effecting the Chinese economy and its import-export markets and the anticipated recommendations from a number of inquiries across the health and aged care, education and social services sectors. Global consulting firm KPMG anticipates the budget will focus on cost of living challenges, investment in infrastructure, and emission reduction initiatives. During a press conference with the Committee for Economic Development in Australia, Chalmers said there would be no \"big cash splashes\", in part due to declining iron ore prices and \"softening labour market\", and that much of the leading items had already been announced including an expansion of the NDIS, university reforms and aged care changes.\n\n\n==== Political importance ====\nPolitical reporter Brett Worthington surmised in his analysis that the federal budget will likely deliver an overall surplus for the second year in a row with massive political significance. The Australian Labor Party is frequently criticised by the opposing Liberal Party for what is seen as financial mismanagement, however Worthington highlights that the Liberal-led coalition had failed to deliver a single surplus budget during its nine years of power until 2022. The 2023–24 budget was the first federal surplus in 15 years, with a final surplus of more than A$22 billion, an improvement of more than A$100 billion since Labor won the 2022 federal elections from the coalition.\n\n\n=== Announcements ===\nOn Wednesday 17 April, defence minister Richard Marles announced more than A$50 billion of extra funding for the Australian Defence Force over 10 years, bringing total military spending to 2.4% of the national GDP. Marles also announced the budget would include the re-allocation of an additional A$72.8 billion in planned spending, and an immediate A$1 billion injection to \"accelerate long-range missiles and targeting systems, as well as lethal autonomous systems.\" Included in the conference at the National Press Club was a renewed focus on sea passages throughout South-East Asia and projecting Australia's defence capabilities throughout the region.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Chiu Sin Hang (Chinese: 趙善恆; born 11 March 1984) is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter, film director and actor. Debuting as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the rock band ToNick, Chiu gained public recognition with the band's first album Let's Go and their non-album single \"Last Christmas\" in 2010. He made his onscreen debut with a guest role in the HKTV drama series Second Life (2015), and ventured into film directing with the horror film Vampire Cleanup Department (2017). Continuing his pursuits in both film and music, Chiu directed and starred in the sports film One Second Champion (2021), earning a nomination for Best New Director and winning Best Original Film Song as the singer and composer of the theme song in the 40th Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2023, Chiu made his television directorial debut and starred as the male lead in the ViuTV drama series Beyond the Common Ground.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChiu was born in 1984 in Hong Kong. He became interested in music and started learning guitar after watching Back to the Future. He attended the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and joined the music clubs and bands at the university. He also met his future bandmates Ryan Chan, Siugwai Wu, and Yip Sen Hei at PolyU. Chiu transferred to the School of Film and Television of the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts a year later and majored in sound system design. He also began directing short films in his freshman year at HKAPA and befriended Anthony Yan, his future frequent collaborator, while working on a project for a directorial course. Chiu graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2007. He formed the rock band ToNick alongside his PolyU friends Chan, Su, and Yip after watching a concert by Mayday in the same year. He worked as a full-time screenwriter for several years before the band's official debut and the release of their first single \"Mochi Ice Cream\" in 2010. Chiu then spent most of his time composing and performing with the band and took on several part-time jobs, including teaching guitar, stage management, working at a cha chaan teng, and working for a renovation company to make a living. The band received public recognition after releasing their first album Let's Go and an non-album single \"Last Christmas\" on YouTube in 2010. Chiu, still intending to participate in film projects, also wrote several screenplays with Yan but failed to pitch them to distributors. However, he secured a guest role in the 2015 HKTV drama series Second Life as the younger version of Wilfred Lau's character. In 2016, Chiu became one of the co-hosts of the ViuTV music program Canton Lyrics Lovers.\nIn 2017, Chiu made his directorial debut alongside Anthony Yan with the horror romance film Vampire Cleanup Department. Although the film was not able to be released in China due to censorship, it was positively received in Hong Kong and grossed over HK$6 million at the local box office. \"Stay Together\", the theme song of the film which was composed and performed by ToNick, also went viral on the internet and won numerous music awards that year, including a nomination for Best Original Film Song in the 37th Hong Kong Film Awards. He also starred in the 2019 action thriller film The Fatal Raid and the 2021 romance film P.T.G.F..\nIn 2021, Chiu directed his second feature film One Second Champion and starred in a lead role as Yip Chi Shun, an heir to a boxing gym and a boxing fanatic, alongside Endy Chow and Lin Min Chen, the lead actress from Vampire Cleanup Department. He was nominated for Best New Director and won Best Original Film Song as the co-performer and composer of the film's theme song \"Origin of Time\" in the 40th Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2023, Chiu made his television directorial debut with the ViuTV drama series Beyond the Common Ground, while also taking on the lead role as Yip Chi Fan, a former barrister who became disillusioned with the corruption and manipulation of the law in the legal system, starring alongside Ivy So and Vincent Kok.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nChiu was in a relationship with singer Hana Tam for over ten years, and they had plans of getting married. However, they ultimately broke up in February 2023. After their breakup, Chiu was diagnosed with depression and struggled with it for a year.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChiu Sin Hang at IMDb",

In May 1877 she became an orphan. Her father who was a master mariner was the captain of the brigantine Emily Smith at Kangaroo Island when it ran aground. Her parents, her three siblings, and about sixteen others drowned when the boat was wrecked. She was daughter of her father's second marriage and she went to live in Adelaide with her elder six half-siblings. She trained as a nurse at Adelaide hospital. \nWhen the First World War started she had been a member of the Australian Army Nursing Service for ten years. She was working as a district nurse, but she one of the first nurses to be sent abroad. She was posted as a sister to Egypt arriving at the end of 1914. In 1916 she was working in Cairo when her service was recognised with a second class Royal Red Cross. In 1917 she was posted from France to Italy as a temporary matron. In the New Years Honours in 1918 she was mentioned in despatches and awarded a first class Royal Red Cross.\n\nOn 3 June 1919 Sister Davidson was made a CBE in the King's Birthday Honours before she returned to Australia. From then until 1933 she was the matron of the military hospital at Keswick and in 1924 she became the Principal Matron for the area.\nDavidson died in 1939 in Semaphore and she was buried in South Australia's West Terrace Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

He was captain of the Crescent College XV that won their first ever Munster Schools Senior Cup title in 1947, then got his start in senior rugby with Old Crescent RFC, serving as their inaugural captain.\nBerkery was named by All Black Bob Scott as the best fullback he saw over the course of their 1953–54 tour, after facing his opposite number playing with Munster. He subsequently broke into the Ireland side, winning 11 caps between 1954 and 1958. His Ireland career included a win over the Wallabies. He captained Lansdowne in the 1956–57 season.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPaddy Berkery at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Protection Mountain is a mountain in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada.\n\n\n== Description ==\nProtection Mountain, elevation 2,972 metres (9,751 feet), is located in the Sawback Range immediately north of Castle Mountain in Banff National Park. The peak is situated 12 kilometres southeast of Lake Louise hamlet and five kilometres east of the Bow Valley Parkway. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Bow River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,470 metres (4,823 feet) above Bow Valley in four kilometres (2.5 miles). The mountain was so named in 1911 by James F. Porter (1871–1939) because the mountain is said to protect an especially beautiful valley to the north which he called Wonder Valley. The mountain's toponym and position was officially adopted on October 20, 1983, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The summit is unofficially called \"Television Peak\" and it ranks as the sixth-highest peak in the Sawback Range.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Protection Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nLike other mountains in Banff Park, Protection Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nGeography of Alberta\nAlberta's Rockies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeather: Protection Mountain\nParks Canada web site: Banff National Park",

It spans over 390 acres around the Ousteri lake.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\nThe lake is home to around 200 species of birds. About 40 species of migratory birds visit the sanctuary after November everyear including golden oriole, openbill stork, tailor bird, painted stork, white ibis, white-breasted water-hen and spotted owlets. The vegetation ranges from small herbs to trees, which supports migratory avifauna as well as native birds during summer and winter.\nHowever, bird poaching poses a significant threat to the sanctuary. In 2022, the Wildlife Department in Puducherry seized 57 bird carcasses, which had been poisoned and killed by poachers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Glabridorsum stokesii is a species of parasitoid wasp belonging to the family Ichneumonidae first described by Peter Cameron in 1912, known to be a generalist parasite of species including crop pest species such as the codling moth and Grapholita molesta. The species is native to southeastern Australia, and has been introduced to New Zealand.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was originally named Gambrus stokesii by Peter Cameron in 1912. The species was reclassified as Ischnus stokesii by Henry Keith Townes, Marjorie Chapman Townes V. K. Gupta in 1961; reclassified a second time as Glabridorsum stokesii in 1970 by Henry Keith Townes.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe species is native to southeastern Australia. It was introduced to New Zealand between 1969 and 1974 as a measure to combat moth species that impacted fruit growing, and successfully established in Auckland and Hawkes Bay. By the 2020s, the species had become common across both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand, and identified in the Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.\nBetween 1932 and 1939, attempted introductions of Gambrus stokesii were conducted in the United States as a part of pest control programmes, however the species failed to establish.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBelow is Cameron's original description:\n\nBlack; abdominal petiole red except at apex; face, clypeus, basal half of mandibles, palpi, the orbits all round, more broadly on the malar space, the yellow there extending to the base of mandible, a broad line on sides of pronotum, inwardly extending to shortly beyond the base of the parapsidal furrows, a mark on apex of middle lobe, twice longer than wide, the base round, the apex transverse, scutellum, the apical slope of metanotum, the top gradually narrow from the outerside, tubercles, a longish triangular line on lower basal half of proplevirae, a large spot on base of mesopleurae, the top bluntly rounded, thence becoming, on the apical side, gradually widened to near the bottom, which projects into a square, the usual mark below the hind wings, a large triangular mark, the narrowed end above, on the metapleurae and the apices of all the abdominal segments, whitish-yellow. The eighth to fourteenth antennal joints white. Wings hyaline, stigma and nervures dark fuscous, the former darker in front, areolet narrowed in front, as wide there as that bounded by the recurrent and second transverse cubital nervures, the recurrent received at the base of the apical third. Pro- and mesothorax smooth, furrows crenulated, the parapsidal weakly so, sternal more strongly, the part immediately below tegulae to the yellow mark striated, the striae continued down the upper half of the furrow. Base of metanotum weakly, sparsely punctured, the rest rather strongly, weakly reticulated; second transverse keel weaker than the basal. Abdomen smooth and shining, except the second segment, which is opaque and aciculated.\nCameron's female holotype measured 7 mm (0.28 in) in length, and was found in Glen Innes, New South Wales in January, laying eggs in weevil larvae.\n\n\n== Behaviour ==\nGlabridorsum stokesii is a generalist parasite, known to be a parasite of the codling moth and Grapholita molesta, the oriental fruit moth.\n\n\n== Parasites ==\nGlabridorsum stokesii is a host to two species of parasitoid wasp, Gelis cinctus and Gelis tenellus.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a shrub with egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped leaves and white, tube-shaped flowers with bearded lobes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia tecta is a shrub that typically grows up to 30 cm (12 in) high and has a thick, woody trunk has many thick stems. The leaves are egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, almost overlapping, 13–19 mm (0.51–0.75 in) long with a short, sharply-pointed tip. The flowers are scarcely longer than the leaves, with bracteoles nearly 4 mm (0.16 in) long at the base. The sepals are 8.5–11 mm (0.33–0.43 in) long, and the petals are white, 13–15 mm (0.51–0.59 in) long and joined at the base forming a tube with bearded lobes.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Astroloma tectum in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 1824, Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel transferred the species to Styphelia as S. tecta. The specific epithet (tecta) means \"hidden\" or \"concealed\", referring to the inconspicuous flowers.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species grows in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee bioregions of southern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia striata is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

The available Kannada inscriptions can be found in Bugle rock park and Dodda Basavana Gudi or Big bull temple.

        "content": "\"Due note\" (English: Two notes) is a song recorded by Italian singer Mina. It was written by Bruno Canfora, Antonio Amurri, Raffaele Sposito, and the arrangement for the song was prepared by Tony De Vita. The song became the final theme of the 1960 television broadcast of Canzonissima, and the following year it was included in the album of the same name.\nThe song was released as a single in November 1960, its peculiarity is that on the reverse side a song performed by another artist was used — \"Uno spicchio di luna\" performed by Mario D'Alba. The single will soon be re-released, and the song \"Non voglio cioccolata\" will be used as the B-side, already performed by Mina. The song was a success on the Italian charts, reaching number three, and by December 1960 sales exceeded 10,000 copies.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7\" single\nA. \"Due note\" – 3:34\nB. \"Uno spicchio di luna\" (Ida Frugoni, Pesce, Mario Quargnenti) – 3:18\n7\" single\nA. \"Due note\" – 3:34\nB. \"Non voglio cioccolata\" (Mario Panzeri, Jack Morrow) – 1:50\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCastaldo, Gino, ed.

First built in 1704, the church was later expanded in 1860 by adding a transept and surrounding it with a wall and watchtowers for defense against pirates. It survived the tidal wave that hit Tanauan in 1897.\nThe National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) declared the church a national historical landmark in 1949.\nDuring Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, it served as an evacuation center for the locals.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Tanauan Church (Leyte) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Jakub Surovec, more commonly known in Poland as Jakub Surowiec (born in 1715 in Tisovec, died on 11 October 1740 in Brezno) was a Slovak outlaw, one of the most famous in the country. Along with his group, he engaged in banditry across significant areas of the Central and Inner Western Carpathians. Challenging the feudal system, he gained considerable recognition among the impoverished population. After capturing Surovec, Austrian authorities sentenced him to death. Tales of him made their way into fiction; he is portrayed in a significant number of Polish and Slovak works of art depicting outlaw themes. He is often mistakenly believed to be associated with Juraj Jánošík.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJakub Surovec was born in Tisovec as the son of a poor shepherd named Ondrej. Already in childhood, he stood out for his developed sense of justice and sensitivity to social inequalities. In his youth, he worked as a shepherd in Tisovec, near Muráň and in Horehronie. He had reddish hair and dark mustache. He was twice caught stealing sheep, resulting in a punishment of two hundred lashes the first time and a year's imprisonment in Rimavská Sobota the second time.\nIn 1739, he met Martin, known as \"Poliak\" due to his Podhale origin, a bandit leader who allowed him to join his group. Thanks to his strength and courage, he distinguished himself enough that when the bandits gathered again the following spring, he became the leader, and Martin Poliak settled for the role of deputy. The formed group consisted of eleven (sometimes erroneously reported as nine or ten) members. In addition to Surovec and Poliak, they were: Pavol Gajdoš, also known as Poliak, Tomaš Greguš from Kubachy in Spiš, who previously worked as a shepherd on Čierny vrch, Juraj Klanica from Krásna Hôrka (today a district of Tvrdošín), Juraj Lukáč from Dúbrava, Ján Oravec, Matej Pijak-Hajduch from Chlebnice, Ondrej Ponický from Poniky, Juraj Turčan, and Michał Tylka, who, like Martin Poliak, came from Dzianisz.\nThe group assembled in full around 24 June 1740, in a hut near Valaská, from where, between late June and early July, they set off on a banditry journey, following Poliak's advice and heading towards Orava, the Tatras, and Podhale. They robbed, among other places, the church in Valaská, a dyeing workshop in Slanica, a customs office in Mýtna, as well as numerous travelers on the roads and shepherds. They turned back south after a raid near Nowy Targ (depending on the source, it could have been an attack on a nobleman's manor, a wealthy peasant's farm, a tavern, or even looting the town itself, which would have been Surovec's greatest achievement, but it is known that the loot obtained was relatively small). The group's range of activity was exceptionally wide: from Horehronie (the forests between Brezno and Tisovec served as the main base) through Gemer and Novohrad to Liptov, Orava, and the Tatras, all the way to Nowy Targ.\n\nThe members of the group mostly came from the poorest layers of society, which is why the fact that Surovec undertook to provide his subordinates with free clothing played a significant role in recruiting them. They all wore bark shoes, which they preserved with lard for greater durability. Their weaponry consisted of muskets, hand cannons, pistols, and shepherd's axes, purchased or acquired in battle depending on the specific case. They also treated wounds with puppy fat. The goods obtained were partly used for current needs (food, ammunition, alcohol, clothing, gaining the support of the population), and partly placed in mountain hideouts known to them. Strict discipline and the repeated swearing of the bandit oath played a crucial role in Surovec's organization of bandit life: I swear to the eternal God, the Holy Trinity, and all God's saints that I will never betray, lie to, abandon my companions in good or bad fortune. Matej Pijak-Hajduch testified that he had to renew the oath seven times a year. Surovec focused on attacks on the nobility and wealthy merchants, trying to maintain friendly relations with the rural population, which made it much easier for the group to disperse and escape pursuit; sometimes he is attributed the intention of inciting an anti-feudal uprising.\nFrom August 1740 onwards, the Austrian administration organized a large-scale hunt against Surovec's group. Late in the evening on September 16, during a brawl at a tavern in Pohronská Polhora, the bandit and only one of his companions (Greguš) were surprised by six members of the citizen guard. Both were captured after a fierce fight in which Surovec suffered serious gunshot wounds and blows from an axe. After torture, both bandits were sentenced to death. Surovec's execution took place near Brezno, on a hill called Viselnice, by breaking wheel from above on October 11 (some sources mention beheading and other dates, such as September 20, November 10 or 11). Shortly thereafter, most of the remaining group members were also captured and sentenced.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nReception of Jakub Surovec serves as an example of \"moderately approving\" attitude of the population towards banditry. There is a tradition that after the execution (and shortly before her coronation as Queen of Hungary), Maria Theresa visited the parents of the deceased to offer condolences and listen to stories about him. Legend made him a companion of Juraj Jánošík, which is impossible for chronological reasons (Surovec was born two years after the execution of the most famous Carpathian bandit). However, the description of his acceptance into Jánošík's band became a popular motif in Gorals' folk tales, penetrating into regional reverse glass painting as well. Out of 459 glass paintings preserved in the collections of the Tatra Museum, only thirteen have secular themes, but nine of them repeat the motif called \"the reception of Surowiec\". Already in 1862, Kazimierz Łapczyński described how a Goral from Szlachtowa presented him with such a painting along with a story.\nBohuslav Tablic published a poem in Czech in 1809 titled Jakub Surowec Loupežnjk Orawský – it was a translation from an anonymous Slovak manuscript (the manuscript has survived; its creation is dated between the fifth and eighth decades of the 18th century) and one of the earliest known examples of banditry themes in literature. This poem, consisting of 348 lines, takes the form of an elegiac self-portrait, with the lyrical subject being imprisoned Surovec. It frequently uses a motif of a bandit betrayed by his lover, which is often employed but contradicts the facts. Jakub Surovec is also mentioned by Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, albeit superficially and not in accordance with the current state of historical knowledge. However, there is also a folk song criticizing him for gluttony, and the word surowiec began to be used in a common sense of \"thief, bandit, rascal\".\nToday, the name of Jakub Surovec was given to an educational trail in the Muránska planina National Park, and on the Zbojská pass (as of 2019), an old small-leaved lime tree still grows, under which – according to legend – the bandit often rested; the nearby mountain hut gladly uses this story for advertising.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The elections were held for the role of Mayor of Porirua plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors, also elected triennially. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe incumbent Mayor, Whitford Brown, sought re-election for a sixth term. In 1975 Brown had been caught and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. He spent time afterward, including during the election campaign, in treatment for alcoholism at Hanmer Springs. Four councillors challenged him including two official party candidates from Labour and the Values Party. Brown had been an active Labour member in the past and was endorsed by Labour in all previous elections. Two other former Labour ticket councillors (Ted Taylor and Rex Willing) also challenged Brown. For standing as an independent against the official Labour ticket, Willing was later expelled from the party.\n\n\n== Mayoral results ==\n\n\n== Councillor results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mulligan Family Fun Center, often referred to as Mulligan, is an amusement park franchise in Southern California specializing in miniature golf, currently operating in Murrieta, Riverside County.\nMulligan was founded by Georgia Claessens, daughter of South Bay real estate developer Walter Storm, in 1991. Built in Torrance, California, the initial property was repurposed from a private Storm family tract, used to store recreational vehicles, into a driving range. The site expanded around the driving range, which operated until 2007, adding two miniature golf courses, an arcade, a batting cage, and an indoor restaurant. Proving successful in coming years, the business grew further through the 1990s and 2000s, adding more attractions, such as kart racing and laser tag. Two Mulligan locations were franchised elsewhere in the region: Murrieta in 1996 and Palmdale in 2005.\nClaessens died in 2016 at the age of 60, following a fatal horse riding accident. After her death, a series of closures occurred: the original Torrance location closed its doors in February 2020 and burnt down the next year while the location in Palmdale closed in July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the Murrieta location stands as the sole remaining franchise.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Typical Reasons (Swing My Way)\" is a song by American hip hop group Prince Markie Dee and the Soul Convention from their studio album Free (1992), released on September 15, 1993, as the album's second single. It is Prince Markie Dee's most successful song as a solo artist.\n\n\n== Composition and critical reception ==\nIn regard to style, the song has been considered similar to that of rapper Heavy D's music. Steve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews wrote of the song, \"Listening to the song you can't help but think of Bobby Brown, Teddy Riley and Keith Sweat – it's classic 1990's new jack swing all the way. Given the contentious relationship between Chris Brown and Rihanna, the lyrics from the suave and seductive Markie Dee seem apt even today.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Washington County Historical Society (WCHS) is a non-profit organization founded in 1934. Its mission is to collect, preserve, and share the history of Washington County, Minnesota.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn article in the Stillwater Daily Sun of December 17, 1881, first proposed the idea of a Stillwater Historical Society, emphasizing the importance of establishing it promptly to facilitate its future work. It highlighted the potential contributions of local residents in documenting the settlement of the St. Croix Valley and urged the formation of a historical society, suggesting it could extend beyond Stillwater to encompass Washington County or the St. Croix Valley.\nOn April 11, 1934, with about 75 people attended a meeting at the Stillwater Public Library to officially established the Washington County Historical Society. The Washington County Historical Society operated from a room at the Stillwater Public Library, collecting county-wide documents, photos, and family histories.\nIn 1941, the Society purchased the Warden's House Museum in Stillwater from the state, one of the state's oldest buildings and its second oldest continuously operating house museum. The Society also acquired the Hay Lake School in 1974, the Johannes Erickson Log House in the early 1980s. All three buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic family-owned Boutwell Cemetery was purchased in 1978.\nIn 1996, the Society undertook the reconstruction of the Carriage House that originally stood behind the Warden's House. By 2001, climate control had been added, allowing for the safe storage of the textile collection and archives in the new facility.\nThe most recent project involved the opening of the new Washington County Heritage Center in Stillwater, Minnesota.

The Heritage Center explores both the history of Stillwater and the broader story of Washington County and the St. Croix Valley.\nWhile not itself a historic structure, the repurposed building offered the expansive space needed for exhibits and visitor amenities. The transformation involved renovations to create galleries, a research center, an education center, and a retail store within the existing framework. Notably, the new location boasts climate-controlled storage, allowing for proper preservation of the Society's vast collection, including a 28-foot long bateau used for lumber transport in the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Warden's House Museum ===\n\nLocated at 602 North Main Street, the Warden's House Museum was built in 1853.

In 1941 it became the second house museum in Minnesota upon acquisition by the WCHS . Visitors can explore the lives of wardens and their families through preserved furnishings and exhibits throughout its14 rooms.\n\n\n=== Hay Lake School Museum ===\nLocated near Scandia, Minnesota, the Hay Lake School Museum was built in 1872 and served as a one-room schoolhouse for over 80 years.  Preserved in its original condition, the schoolhouse offers visitors a chance to experience a typical rural classroom setting from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Furnishings include student desks, a teacher's desk, and educational materials from the period.\n\n\n=== Johannes Erickson Log Home ===\n\nAlso located near Scandia, the Johannes Erickson Log Home was built in 1853 by a Swedish immigrant family.

He was exported to Australia in April 2004. \n\n\n== Racing record ==\nNotable performances by Maldivian include:\n\n1st in the 2007 Easter Cup (Group 3, Caulfield), beating Duoro Valley and Spinney\n1st in the 2007 JRA Cup (listed race), beating Pacino and Master O'Reilly\n1st in the 2007 Yalumba Stakes (Group 1), beating Miss Finland and Anamoto\n1st in the 2008 Cox Plate (Group 1), beating Zipping and Samantha Miss\n1st in the 2009 C F Orr Stakes (Group 1), beating Alamosa and Theseo.\nMaldivian was the short priced favourite in the 2007 Caulfield Cup but was a late-scratching due to badly gashing his head in the barrier stalls. \nMaldivian retired from racing after suffering a tendon injury during trackwork.  He lived out his final years at Victoria's Cityview Farm.\nMaldivian died in July 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

Bejaouti was critically injured, and none of the hostages were harmed during the assault. Following the intervention, all hostages were taken to a crisis center where parents awaited news of their children. The crisis, which lasted 28 hours, sparked national and international attention, prompting scrutiny of police tactics and the handling of hostage situations. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Defacing God is a melodic death metal band from Aarhus, Denmark, formed in 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2015, singer Sandie Gjørtz and drummer Michael Olsson formed Defacing God. Two years later, the line-up was completed by guitarists Signar Petersen and Christian Nielsen, as well as bassist Rasmus Munch Nielsen. Except for Gjørtz and guitarist Nielsen, the other musicians played in various groups.\nIn 2019 and 2020, two singles, The Marked Ones and Succumb the Euphoria, were released by the group without a label. On 12 August 2021, the Austrian label Napalm Records announced that it had signed the group. The contact with Napalm Records came from the musicians who contacted the label shortly after the release of the music video for Succumb the Euphoria. Napalm Records was interested in the group's concept and eventually began working with the band.\nOn 2 September 2022, the band released their debut album The Resurrection of Lilith via Napalm Records. The original plan was to release The Resurrection of Lilith as an EP. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of releasing the work in two to three EPs in quick succession was discarded and a full-fledged album was produced instead. The band played at Copenhell for the first time in summer 2023. A European tour followed in November as opening act for Krisiun.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nIn an interview with Stefan Popp for the online magazine Metal1.info in 2022, Gjørtz explained that they initially experimented with different styles of music, but mainly focused on melodic death metal. According to Popp, the music on The Resurrection of Lilith sounds like a mixture of Dimmu Borgir, Naglfar, Satyricon and Arch Enemy.\nJannik Kleemann from Metal.de also recognizes musical similarities to Arch Enemy and identifies them based on the singer Sandie Gjørtz. According to Kleemann, there is also an orchestral and symphonic level, which, however, has a more supportive effect. Based on this, Kleemann also identifies groups such as Fleshgod Apocalypse and Ex Deo as musical references.\nWhen asked about the inspiration for her lyrics, Gjørtz replied that she is influenced by films, books, occult, history, folklore and witchcraft. They also visit abandoned places, cemeteries or museums with grotesque or dark themes. Kleemann writes that the songs are, among other things, about occult female power, with the mythological figures of Lilith, Jezebel and Abyzou being brought to the fore, which ultimately results in the song Rise of the Trinity. Florian Blumann sees a feminist message in some texts, for example in the song Resurrection. According to Blumann, the themes of occultism and the burning witches can also be perfectly transferred to today.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2022: The Resurrection of Lilith (Napalm Records)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Mitanni Letter is a term used in historiography to refer to a document written in the Hurrian language by the Mitanni king Tushratta, dating from the first half of the 14th century BCE. The letter was discovered in 1887 in Amarna. Originally, it consisted of 494 lines, but only 466 lines have been preserved either in whole or in fragments. The content of the letter pertains to matters related to the marriage of Tushratta's daughter, Tadukhipa, to Amenhotep III. The Mitanni Letter is one of the primary sources for the analysis of the Hurrian language.\n\n\n== Research status ==\nThe document was discovered during excavations at Tell el-Amarna in 1887. Alongside it, archives of the pharaohs Amenhotep III and Akhenaten were found, containing diplomatic correspondence. Several letters originated from Mitanni, from King Tushratta. They were written in Akkadian, which was commonly used as the diplomatic language at the time. An exception was a document whose language was initially unidentified, so it was preliminarily referred to as Mitanni – from the name of the state ruled by the author of the letter. The term Hurrian came into use several decades later, after the discovery of documentation from Hattusa, although earlier the language of Tushratta's letter was also suggested to be called Subartian, derived from Subartu – the Babylonian term for Upper Mesopotamia, inhabited by Hurrian peoples. The document itself was named the Mitanni Letter.\nEven before the concept of Hurrians entered historiography, the presence of foreign words was noted in Akkadian texts. Friedrich Delitzsch, in his Akkadian synonym list, annotated these words with su(-bir4ki), speculating that they contained a variation of the name of the land of Subartu. The Mitanni Letter was published by Hugo Winckler and Ludwig Abel two years after its discovery. In 1890, Henry Sayce published the results of research on non-Semitic and non-Sumerian proper names and common words found in Akkadian texts in correspondence from Tell el-Amarna and Tunip. He correctly assumed that they bore similarity to the texts of rock inscriptions from Lake Van and probably belonged to the same linguistic group (later this group was named the Hurro-Urartian languages).\nThe Mitanni Letter was studied by scholars such as Peter Jensen, Rudolph E. Brünnow, Ludwig Messerschmidt, and Ferdinand Bork. Peter Jensen observed that the text contained words identical to those marked with the su(-bir4ki) note from Delitzsch's list. He documented his findings in a work from 1891. Ludwig Messerschmidt in 1899 and Henry Sayce a year later published analyses of one of the Akkadian documents from Tunip, dating from the Amarna period and containing foreign glosses. The researchers noted their similarity to the words marked by Delitzsch and classified them as belonging to the Mitanni language. In 1906, Ferdinand Bork added numerous proper names to this group, discovered in texts from Old and Middle Babylonian periods.\nDuring the study of the Mitanni Letter, most scholars employed a combinatory method. They compared the text to other documents of Tushratta written in Akkadian and found in Tell el-Amarna alongside the Mitanni Letter. All the letters from the Mitanni king followed a consistent pattern, using identical phrases, and addressed similar matters. This facilitated the creation of a quasi-bilingual Akkadian-Hurrian dictionary.\n\nThe Mitanni Letter under the designation VAT 422 (EA 24) is housed in the Amarna collection of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Since its discovery, depending on the publication, it has been numbered as WA 27, VS 12 or Kn 24. In 1902, the first transcription of the text was published by Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon, with a reissue in 1964. In 1915, Otto Schroeder published the cuneiform autograph of the Mitanni Letter in his work Die Tontafeln von El-Amarna, assigning it the number 200. According to Maciej Popko, the copy made by the researcher is considered the best in the scholarly community, although Johannes Friedrich considered it not very good. In 1932, Johannes Friedrich published a transcription of the letter in his work Kleinasiatische Sprachdenkmäler. In 1982, Gernot Wilhelm included fragments of the letter's translation into German in his publication Grundzüge der Geschichte und Kultur der Hurriter. Ten years later, William L. Moran translated the document into English.\n\tAutography of the Mittani Letter, published by Otto Schroeder in 1915\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nAt the end of the 15th century BCE, Thutmose IV, seeking an ally in the Near East to support his control over Syria, established political relations with Artatama I, the ruler of Mitanni. These were sealed by the marriage of the pharaoh to Princess Mutemwiya. The alliance was also beneficial for Artatama I, who feared the growing power of the Hittites. The successors of both rulers – Amenhotep III and Tushratta – continued the policies of Thutmose IV and Artatama I. Two marriages of the pharaoh served as guarantees of good relations: with the Mitanni princess Gilukhipa – Tushratta's sister, and later in his life, with Tadukhipa – the daughter of the king of Mitanni. Agreements between the two states were preceded by the exchange of diplomatic correspondence. Shortly after Tadukhipa's arrival in Egypt, Amenhotep III passed away. Therefore, the princess became the wife of Akhenaten.\nThe passive approach of Amenhotep III's successor to Asian politics contributed to the weakening of Mitanni. Assyria and Hattusa took advantage of this situation. The rulers of both cities formed a military alliance against Mitanni. Tushratta perished as a result of the conflict with Šuppiluliuma I, and his successors acknowledged the supremacy of the Hittite kings.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe document was written on a clay tablet in cuneiform script. The text is divided into four columns and originally contained 494 lines. Apart from the Akkadian introductory formulas, it was written in the western dialect of the Hurrian language: the text in Hurrian comprised 478 lines, while in Akkadian – 16. Most fragments of the text are well preserved.\nThe first column contains 115 lines. 13 lines – from 28 to 40 inclusive – are completely destroyed. The second column contains 125 lines, with 12 lines destroyed – from 37 to 48 inclusive. Columns 3 and 4 are on the reverse side of the document. The third column consists of 124 lines. None are destroyed, but several are fragmented. The last column contains 127 lines, preserved in whole or in part. After line 81, three (though possibly more) lines are broken off. At the level of line 85, the space between the fourth and third columns is filled with loose fragments. In total, 466 lines have been preserved in whole or in fragments: 102 in the first column, 113 in the second, 124 in the third, and 127 in the fourth.\nThe recipient of the letter is Amenhotep III. The letter contains matters concerning the marriage of Tadukhipa to Amenhotep III, mentions of her dowry, with references to previous letters listing items given to Tadukhipa as dowry, references to building good political relations between Egypt and Mitanni, information about the exchange of envoys along with their names – the Egyptian Mane and the Mitannian Keliya, assurances of friendship between the two states, and Mitanni's loyalty to Egypt.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFriedrich, J.

        "content": "The planned law on self-determination with regard to gender entry (German: Gesetz über die Selbstbestimmung in Bezug auf den Geschlechtseintrag, SBGG), unofficially also called the Self-Determination Act (German: Selbstbestimmungsgesetz) is intended to make it easier for transgender, intersex and non-binary people in Germany to have their gender entry and first name changed.\nA draft bill of the law has been available since May 2023, which, after detailed changes, was passed as a government draft on 23 August 2023 and, after further changes, was adopted by the German Bundestag on 12 April 2024.\nThe law stipulates that the gender entry and first name can be changed by simply making a declaration at the Standesamt; A three-month waiting period must be observed beforehand. Medical measures are neither regulated nor mandated by the SBGG.\nWith the entry into force of the Self-Determination Act (planned for 1 November 2024), the 1980 Transsexuals Act (German: Transsexuellengesetz, TSG), which prescribes a complex expert procedure and judicial recognition of the changes for changing the gender entry and name, will no longer be in force. In addition, it amends the 2018 Third gender law, which previously only allowed intersex people to legally identify as a third, non-binary gender.\n\n\n== Details ==\nIn the version of the government draft of 23 August 2023, the SBGG provides for a standardized regulation for trans and intersex people. To change the gender entry and first name, all that is necessary is a declaration to the registry office (§ 2 Para. 1), as well as the assurance that the chosen gender entry or first name best corresponds to the gender identity (§ 2 Para. 2 and 4). For minors over 14 years of age, the consent of a legal representative (or the family court) should be necessary (Section 3 Paragraph 1), for minors under 14 years of age the legal representative should be able to make the declaration themselves (Section 3 Paragraph 2). According to the draft, the declaration must be announced to the registry office three months in advance (§ 4). After the change, a blocking period of one year (§ 5) will apply. Documents that still contain the old first names or the old gender entry should have to be reissued upon request (§ 10).\nDomestic rules (Section 6 Paragraph 2) and sport (Section 6 Paragraph 3) should be independent of gender entry. Medical measures should also not be regulated by the SBGG (Section 6 Paragraph 4).\nIn the event of tension or defense, the previous assignment to the male gender should remain in place with regard to \"service with weapons\" (military service) (§ 9). This should apply to changes in gender entry that were declared at the earliest two months before the defense case was established.\nThe SBGG contains a ban on disclosure, according to which it should be forbidden to reveal or research the previous gender entry and previous first names (§ 13). \"For special reasons of public interest\", e.g. B. for criminal prosecution, this ban is suspended (Section 13 Paragraph 1 Sentence 3). Anyone who violates the ban on disclosure and thereby intentionally harms the person concerned should commit an administrative offense and be liable to a fine of up to €10,000 (Section 14).\nThe federal government should be obliged to review the law within five years and report on it to the Bundestag.\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nThe law was initiated by the progressive traffic light coalition and voted upon in the Bundestag on the 12 April 2024. It was adopted with 372 votes in favour, 251 against, 11 abstentions and 100 absent.\nQueer associations criticised the draft for the 3-month waiting period, which did not previously exist in TSG and para. 45b PStG. Furthermore, trans people with legal guardians (due to impairments or disabilities) would not get self-ID under the draft. Legal guardians should be there to protect vulnerable people from things like giving away their possessions, but not to prevent them from coming out as trans, the association Queer Handicap argued.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransgender rights in Germany\nLegal recognition of non-binary gender\nThird gender law (Germany)\n\n\n== References ==",

It is probably gravitationally bound to IC 5338, the brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 2626. IC 5337 is a jellyfish galaxy, mainly due to dynamic stripping pressure. Star-forming gas are thrown about, as the galaxy penetrates through the thin gas layer and causing them to drip from the galaxy's disc, giving it its unique appearance of a cosmic jellyfish. In the image, other galaxies can be seen in the background.\nIC 5337 was discovered by French astronomer, Stephane Javelle on November 25, 1897. It has an active galactic nucleus according to SIMBAD and considered an emission-line galaxy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIC 4141\nPGC 2456\nJellyfish galaxy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Grande Conquista 2 is the second season of the Brazilian reality television series A Grande Conquista, which premiered on Monday, April 22, 2024,  on RecordTV. Under the direction of Rodrigo Carelli, The show is commanded by Lucas Selfie and Ju Nogueira on digital platforms and hosted by Rachel Sheherazade, (replacing Mariana Rios, who left the show after one season) she who makes her debut as the new host of the series.\n\n\n== Format ==\nUnlike the first season, the second has undergone some changes in format, now reducing the stages to just two.\n\n\n=== Stage 1 ===\nIn the Villa, the 100 candidates live in three houses (starting with 47 in the Orange house, 33 in the Blue house and 20 in the Green house), having to share beds and limited supplies for 19 days, while facing a series of challenges and mass evictions. The last 20 to survive in the Villa compete in the final challenge, in which the public decides whether the winner secures a place in the next stage of the game. Then, the remaining candidates face the final public vote for the last spots in the Mansion.\nThe new thing on this season is that the Villa's owners, when they win the challenges, get a bigger advantage Whether of which house they end up in, the leader is sent to a house of a different color (or the same one if that's the case) and receives missions from the production and the external audience The main goal is to convince the contestant to stay in the show through mental games, and if any contestant gives up, the house where the owner is (whether it's the opponent's or not) gets punished.\n\n\n==== Mansion spots competition ====\n\n\n=== Stage 2 ===\nThe 20 selected contestants move into the Mansion on week 3. Each week, two contestants become the Mansion's owners and delegate the weekly tasks, while three contestants are voted into the Risk Zone (the Owners' nominee, the Secret vote nominee between the two Owners and the Mansion's face-to-face vote nominee among all eligible contestants), where they compete in the Safety challenge to escape eviction.\nThe Safety winner is exempt from nominations, however, they must replace themselves with another contestant of their choice in order to determine that week's set of nominees who would face the public vote.\n\n\n==== Display scheme ====\nMonday: Discord Activities\nTuesday: Risk Zone (live)\nWednesday: Safety Challenge (live)\nThursday: Eviction (live)\nFriday: Mansion's owners Tasks of the Week\nSaturday: Interaction + Party (live flashes)\nSunday: Party\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Two contestants with health problems and Ysani Kalapalo's entrance ===\nBefore starting the show tasks, 98 out of the 100 contestants entered, as two competitors (known as villagers until they are promoted to the mansion) needed to be isolated due to health reasons. Host Rachel Sheherazade had not revealed who the two absent contestants were, but shortly after, the scene of Vinícius de Paula joining his colleagues in the orange house aired. Vinigram, as he is known, had tested positive for H3N2 flu but managed to recover in time.\nThe second undisclosed competitor was indigenous influencer Ysani Kalapalo, who tested positive for COVID-19. Ysani ended up being disqualified from the show for recovery, never entering the other contestants, and was replaced by Lara Costa. But was reintegrated into the cast after Gaby Fontenelle's withdrawal.\n\n\n=== Fellipe Villas' disobedience ===\nOn April 25, 2024, it was reported by external news portals that the contestant Fellipe Villas had his license request denied by the Military Police of Espírito Santo. Villas, who is a military police officer, would have signed up to enter in the show and when he was called by the production, he requested his request for temporary dismissal, which was not accepted by the corporation.\nEven so, Fellipe entered the show, which led the PM-ES to open an administrative proceeding against the contestant for disobedience, but it was not revealed if there would be any dismissal.\n\n\n=== Ricardo Costa's ejection ===\nIn the early hours of April 26 to 27, 2024, Ricardo Costa and Fábio Gontijo had a strong argument in the bedroom of the orange house. The incident began when singer MC Mari found a wet red swim trunk on her bed. The singer had asked to change beds with Fábio after asking who the piece of clothing belonged to. Then, the pair start a quick argument, which would extend after Gontijo threw his wet swim trunks at Ricardo, who soon after start an argument. The gourmet chef leaves the room after the altercation with the dermatologist and goes towards the kitchen and grabs a knife, but is restrained by other contestants. While those outside created a barrier to prevent him from entering, those inside the room locked and requested the ejection of the contestant, announcing to the camera that the situation has crossed the line. Ending the fight, Vinigram complained about living with the gourmet chef, as well as the other contestants.\nOn the morning of the 27th, Ricardo left the program, but without the production clarifying to the public if he was ejected or if he gave up, leaving even the team of the then contestant without a position on the matter, since the exclusive cameras of PlayPlus did not film that moment. Soon after, Record confirmed the gourmet chef's ejection and made available an excerpt of the scene of the moment when Costa went to the kitchen to get the knife and was prevented from entering the room, leaving to air the moment of his departure and a clearer explanation, with the right to the reaction of the confinement colleagues with the warning,  only on the evening edition of television.\n\n\n== Contestants ==\nOn March 13, 2024, RecordTV announced that applications for the second season of the show were open. Below is the cast of 20 official contestants for this season, with the occupations listed by the official show website and their respective ages at the start of filming.\n\n\n== The game ==\n\n\n=== Owner selection's results ===\n\n\n=== Tasks ===\n\n\n=== Voting history ===\n\n\n==== Notes ====\n\n\n== Ratings and reception ==\n\n\n=== Brazilian ratings ===\nAll numbers are in points and provided by Kantar Ibope Media.\n\nIn 2024, each point represents 253.273 households in 15 market cities in Brazil (73.279 households in São Paulo).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Grande Conquista 2 on R7.com",

        "content": "A Workers' District (Munhwaŏ: 로동자구, romanized: rodongjagu in North Korea, Pyojuneo: 노동자구, romanized: nodongjagu in South Korea) is a third-level administrative division of North Korea, meaning it lies below a city or county. They are a special type of village characterized by high density residential areas located adjacent to industrial sites or special farms.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWorkers' Districts were first introduced with the administrative reform of December 1952. They are established in areas where there are 400 or more adult residents and where the proportion of workers exceeds 65%. A Workers' District will have an administrative agency, the Workers' District Office, and an administrative organization, the Workers' District Accounting Committee.\nTypically, they are established under a county, and there are only a few worker districts that belong to a city, such as Hamhung City's Raeil Workers' District (Korean version).\nAccording to reports from the Republic of Korea Statistics Office, the total number of Workers' Districts is 314 as of 2022, an increase of 16 from 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

He then made three more starts with the team that year, this time in the No. 40, where he got a best finish of sixteenth at Elko Speedway. Meunier then made four more starts the following year, spitting time between Kimmel Racing and C2M, getting a best finish of eighteenth at the season ending race at Kansas Speedway.\nIn 2015, Meunier ran half of the schedule, this time solely driving for Kimmel Racing, where he was running at the end in one race, that coming a Kentucky Speedway, where he finished in eighteenth. He then made only three starts the following year, running for Kimmel at Berlin Raceway, where he finished 21st due to brake issues, and two for Wayne Peterson Racing, finishing 27th at Kentucky due to brake issues, and 33rd at Kansas due to vibrations in the car.\nIn 2017, Meunier ran thirteen races, with a majority of the starts he made that year coming with Wayne Peterson Racing. He finished only four of those races, getting a best finish of eighteenth at Toledo Speedway. He then made only four more starts for Peterson the following year, getting a best result of 22nd at Gateway Motorsports Park.\nIn 2019, it was revealed that Meunier would attempt to make his debut in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at Iowa Speedway, driving the No. 17 Chevrolet for Rick Ware Racing in collaboration with Mike Harmon Racing. After failing to set a time in the first practice session, and setting the slowest time in the second session, he ultimately failed to qualify for the race after suffering a crash in qualifying. This was his most recent attempt as a driver, as he has not raced since then.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMeunier worked as an employee for the Richard Petty Driving Experience from 2013 to 2017, and is the owner of Advantage Roofing and Construction, LLC.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

        "content": "The equites equo publico (\"equestrians with the public horse\") was an ordo, or status group, of elite citizens in the Roman Republic, and later the Roman Empire, who were provided money from the state treasury (12,000 asses) to purchase and maintain a horse. During the republic there were only 1,800 of equites equo publico; by the late republic, only men with property worth some 400,000 sesterces were enrolled.\nThey differed in status from the equites equo suo (\"equestrians with their own horse\") who in the middle republic served in the cavalry and had a similar wealth qualification but were not enrolled in the prestigious equestrian centuries of the comitia centuriata and did not receive public subsidies. Prior to 129 BC, senators were also equites equo publico; after legislation that came into effect that year, all senators were required to give up their public horses.\n\n\n== Details ==\nEquites equo publico were men who met a proper qualification of 100,000 asses and received 10,000 asses from the state treasury to purchase a horse and a further 2,000 to maintain it. This emerged early Rome's need for cavalry and equites equo publico were expected to serve in that role for the city for a period of 10 years. Over time these cavalrymen, proximate in wealth and status to the senators, became a social and political elite, binding wealthy men (eventually across Italy) to the republican system.\nAfter 403 BC, the 1,800 men with the public horse were joined on horses by any other men who met a similar property qualification who were called equites equo suo (\"equestrians with their own horse\"; also equites equo privato). The equites equo suo may have had the same property qualification as those with the public horse but some scholars have argued that their property qualifications were somewhat lower. By the middle republic the equites equo suo outnumbered those on the public horse dramatically: in 225 BC there were 23,000 cavalrymen but only 1,800 of them were equites equo publico.\nThe equites equo publico were highly prestigious both socially and politically, endowed with the social prestige of enrolment in the elite equestrian voting centuries with their disproportionate voting power as well as perks such as reserved seats at games and theatres. The eighteen equestrian centuries in the comitia centuriata, with 100 men each, were made up only of the equites equo publico, with the equites equo suo relegated to the first census class. Magistrates, including old ones, retained the public horse even though they were not expected to serve in the cavalry again. Although the late republic saw the decline of military service among the rich, some equites equo publico continued to serve in the army. \nIn 129 BC senators were required by law to give up their public horses, separating them cleanly from the equites equo publico and after 123 BC equites equo publico without senatorial relatives were called to serve on juries for the permanent courts (quaestiones perpetuae). After the passage of the lex Aurelia in 70 BC, the juries on those permanent courts – according to a common modern reconstruction – was made up in three equal parts by senators, equites equo publico, and the tribuni aerarii who were also equites equo suo.\nDuring the imperial period, the public horse became a title bestowed by the emperor for good service or to bolster loyalty from provincial elites; actual cavalry service did not occur. Modern scholars including Theodor Mommsen and TP Wiseman believe that over the course of the first century AD, the equites equo suo gradually merged into the equites equo publico. The title disappeared in the early 3rd century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Villa Bellavista is a Baroque-style villa located outside of the town of Buggiano in the province of Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nFrancesco Feroni (1614–1696) was a merchant from Livorno, who was sent to Amsterdam as a trader and agent for the Florentine senator Lorenzo Buonaccorsi. By 1652 he became an agent for the Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand-Duke of Tuscany, mediating trade with the English and the Dutch. In 1662, he greatly enriched himself while playing a role for Tuscany in facilitating slave trading between the Protestant countries and Spanish American colonies. By 1672, he had left Amsterdam with most of his riches to return to Tuscany. Back in Tuscany, he gained entrance to the nobility as a senator and minister of finance.\nWith his wealth, in 1673 Feroni purchased this and other lands in Valdinievole. In 1696, Fabio, his son commissioned the present villa from the architect Antonio Maria Ferri. Feroni also built an aqueduct to bring water from the mountains to the valley.\nThe villa facade has a convex layout with corners resembling castle-towers. The interior was extesnsively frescoed by Pier Dandini, depicting scenes that evoke the defense of the Catholic faith. Niccolò Nannetti frescoed two rooms on the ground floor. Giovan Battista Ciceri created the stucco decoration of the chapel and the panels in the central hall.\nOver the past two centuries, the villa has had a number of owners and it no longer contains the original furniture or art collections obtained by the Feronis. The villa is being restored for public use.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n43.87086°N 10.72891°E﻿ / 43.87086; 10.72891",

        "content": "PGC 2456 known as KAZ 364 and JO201, is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation of Cetus. A member of Abell 85 galaxy cluster, it is located 617 million light-years away from the solar system and is considered a jellyfish galaxy due to the fact the tendrils are seen drifting downwards from its core. This mainly occurs when such galaxies like PGC 2456, moves through high speeds across the galaxy clusters, causing ram pressure to stripped gas, thus forming tendrils full of star formation. It is listed as a Seyfert galaxy by SIMBAD, meaning it has an active galactic nucleus. PGC 2456 lies 360 kiloparsecs from the brightest cluster galaxy, Holmberg 15A. \n\n\n== See also ==\nPGC 29820\nPGC 1228197\nJellyfish galaxy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Short Mountain is a mountain-sized monadnock that is the highest point in Cannon County, Tennessee and the Nashville metropolitan area. It is surrounded by the Highland Rim to the north, east and south but is an outlier of the Cumberland Plateau, evidenced by its sandstone caprock reaching over 2,000 feet (610 meters) in elevation; this makes it the westernmost part of Tennessee with an elevation over 2,000 feet (610 meters). Nearby Little Short Mountain to the east and Sugar Tree Knob to the west also stand well over 1,400 feet (427 meters) above sea level, and Little Short Mountain is even still high enough above nearby river valleys in the Nashville Basin to qualify as Class 6 mountain, but they don't have sandstone caprock nor reach the height Short Mountain does.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\nThe headwaters of Mountain Creek drain out of a valley along the eastern slopes of Short Mountain, passing Little Short Mountain to the southwest and heading east to the Collins River, which in turn drains into the Caney Fork, Cumberland, Ohio and Lower Mississippi Rivers. This horseshoe-shaped mountain valley is the site of the Headwaters Wildlife Management Area, which was seized and repurposed by the state government after an illegal marijuana farm's owners were arrested. Dry Creek flows out of the north side of the Gap of the Mountain, the col between Short Mountain and Little Short Mountain, towards the Smith Fork, another major tributary of the Caney Fork River. A tiny tributary of Mountain Creek flows down the southern slope of the Gap of the Mountain. The Clear Fork of the Smith Fork also begins along the northern slope of Short Mountain, as do some of its tributaries; some other tributaries of the Clear Fork begin along the north slope of Sugar Tree Knob.\nThe East Fork Stones River and some of its tributaries begin along the southern slope of Short Mountain; some other tributaries of the East Fork Stones River begin along the southeastern and southwestern slopes of Sugar Tree Knob. The Stones River drains into the Cumberland River but, unlike Mountain Creek, Dry Creek and the Clear Fork, does not drain into the Caney Fork.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe summit of Short Mountain was in USDA Hardiness Zone 6b in 2012 and 7a in 2023 while the surrounding plains and hills and Sugar Tree Knob were in Zone 7a in 2012 and 7b in 2023, indicating a cooler climate on the mountain summit. Little Short Mountain remained in Zone 7a in both recent publications.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nA Bible camp is located a little over 200 feet (61 meters) below the summit of Short Mountain on its northwestern slope. Almost directly north of and downhill from the Bible camp is the Short Mountain Sanctuary for the Radical Faeries. The locally owned Short Mountain Distillery is also nearby.\n\n\n== Access ==\nGunter Hollow Road goes up the eastern slope of the mountain from Tennessee State Route 146; it is paved with chipseal. Firetower Road reaches the summit of the mountain and has a cul de sac at a tower but is an unpaved gravel road.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Women Hunger for Justice was a direct action protest in support of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment in Illinois in 1982. The fast received significant attention in the press and included the participation of Sonia Johnson, Sister Maureen Fiedler and Zoe Nicholson.\n\n\n== Background of the fast ==\nThe deadline set by Congress to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment was during the summer of 1982. The amendment expired on June 30 of that year so a fast was planned by seven women's rights activists to raise attention for the need for the Illinois state legislature to pass the amendment.\n\n\n== Overview of the fast ==\n\nThe fast began on May 18, 1982. During the fast there was both taunting by onlookers and concern in the press for the health of the women who participated. Comedian Dick Gregory came by to visit the women for three days and participated in the fast. The fasters were quoted in the press as saying they were symbolic of the \"suffering of women that has remained invisible.\" Documents and images of the fast are held in the archives at Smith College and the Schlesinger Library.\n\n\n== Support from Gloria Steinem ==\nGloria Steinem paid for a van, known as the \"Gloriamobile\" to transport the women during the fast.\n\n\n== National Organization for Women involvement ==\nThe National Organization for Women paid for rooms for the fasters at a Ramada Inn.\n\n\n== Heath of the fasters ==\nSonia Johnson was very sick during the fast and collapsed on two different occasions. At times she was unable to walk without assistance. Johnson's supporters were worried she was willing to die in support of the ERA.\n\n\n== Participants ==\nEight women ultimately participated in the Women Hunger for Justice fast. Zoe Nicholson wrote a book about her participation in the fast titled A Hungry Heart: A Woman's Fast for Justice.  Women who participated in the fast included\n\nMary Barnes\nDina Bachelor\nSonia Johnson\nSister Maureen Fiedler\nZoe Nicholson\nMary Ann Real\nShirley Wallace\n\n\n== See also ==\nA Group of Women\nGrassroots Group of Second Class Citizens\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Alternative Social Movement (Polish: Alternatywa Ruch Społeczny, ARS) was coalition of Polish political parties formed on 18 March 2001 in Warsaw for the 2001 Polish parliamentary election. The grouping was formed from a merger of Confederation of Independent Poland - Patriotic Camp (Polish: Konfederacja Polski Niepodległej - Obóz Patriotyczny, KPN-Ojczyzna) led by Michał Janiszewski, Tomasz Karwowski, and Janina Kraus, together with a group of politicians originating from the Christian National Union (ZChN), including Henryk Goryszewski and Mariusz Olszewski. The coalition was also joined by the  Free Trade Union 'August 80' Confederation, led by Daniel Podrzycki and Bogusław Ziętek. The Alternative Social Movement was registered as a political party, and its members mainly became the activists of August 80.\nIn the 1997–2001 term of the Polish Sejm, ARS was represented by a parliamentary circle Alternative (Polish: Alternatywa), which included Michał Janiszewski, Tomasz Karwowski, Janina Kraus and Mariusz Olszewski (all elected in 1997 from the Solidarity Electoral Action lists). Henryk Goryszewski (also elected from the Solidarity Electoral Action list) was an unaffiliated MP at the time and remained a member of the Christian National Union. The party was a coalition of various political parties, such as Catholic nationalist ones, national conservatives, ecologists, nationalists socialists and lastly various left-wing activists and trade unionists. Ideologically, it was committed to both Catholic nationalism as well as national left, with the latter ultimately prevailing. The party then became a far-left, socialist and anti-capitalist Polish Labour Party - August 80.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Alternative Social Movement came first from the circle of the Polish Green Party, that ran from the lists of the social-democratic, post-communist Democratic Left Alliance in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election. Elected green activists then established the Polish Ecological Club, and started cooperation with the liberal Christian-democrat Democratic Union, which was an anti-communist, post-Solidarność formation.\nAfter the liberal Freedom Union was formed in 1994, the greens formed the Freedom Union Ecological Forum, a faction within the party which set itself the task of promoting ecological slogans. Greens continued to work with post-Solidarność parties through the Solidarity Electoral Action, a conservative, centre-right coalition of all parties related to Solidarity.\nIn 2000, the greens along with other future founders of the Alternative Social Movement formed the \"People's National Bloc\" (Polish: Blok Ludowo-Narodowy) with the far-left Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samobrona) along with the trade union WZZ 'August '80' and the nationalist Polish Front. However, the new formation was unable to agree on whom it should field as its candidate in the 2000 Polish presidential election. As a result, the bloc was dissolved and the leader of Samoobrona, Andrzej Lepper, ran independently, capturing 3.05% of the popular vote. Samoobrona presented a Catholic socialist and an agrarian socialist program, and called for a return to socialism, with Lepper arguing that Polish socialism \"had not yet reached full maturity\". Despite its failure, the People's National Bloc was an important inspiration for creating a similar alliance for 2001.\nThis green-conservative cooperation then ended with 2001, where green activists decided to cooperate with various political circles, including nationalist and left-wing ones, to form the Alternative Social Movement, which became a conglomerate of numerous, ideologically distant political formations. It comprised, on the one hand, Catholic-nationalist circles led by the Confederation of Independent Poland and, on the other, the left-wing Free Trade Union 'August '80' . The unifying factor between the various elements of the committee was criticism of the policies, particularly neoliberal economic policies, pursued by Jerzy Buzek's government.\nThe party emerged in 2001 in opposition to the government of Jerzy Buzek led by the centre-right Solidarity Electoral Action. Evoking the disastrous economic situation and the financial policies of the government that further aggravated the crisis, the MPs representing the Alternative Social Movement demanded that Buzek resings from his position of Prime Minister and dismisses his cabinet.\nWhile the party was already registered in March 2001, Polish Electoral Commission revoked the previous decision to recognize the Alternative Social Movement as a registered party in August 2001. The leaders of the party lodged a complain to the Supreme Court against the State Electoral Commission, and stated that they will seak to annul the parliamentary elections through legal means if their deregistration was to upheld. The party also sought to turn to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\nThe Polish Electoral Commission justified its refusal to register the electoral committee of the Alternative on the grounds that the committee does not have a valid court decision on the registration of the Alternatywa Social Movement party. The court's decision on registration in the register of political parties held by the Alternative Social Movement has not become final, as an appeal by the party from Kraków has been submitted to the Regional Court in Warsaw.\nThe party then alleged that its sudden deregistration after 5 months of existence was an attempt of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) to suppress its political opponents. Tomasz Karwowski, one of the leaders of the party, stated: \"The AWS, using the procedure for registering electoral committees, through hired people, led to a situation in which attempts were made to deny the existence of our electoral committee in order to - not because of a failure to meet the requirements of the electoral law, but because of procedural tricks and violations of the law in Poland - lead to the fact that our committee would not stand in the elections.\" The accusation was spread through the media, and it was also noted that the Alternative Social Movement was polling between 2 and 8%.\nIn July 2001, during the 2001 Polish floods, the MPs of the Alternative Socialist Movement donated their deputy salaries to flood victims. One of the leaders of the party, Mariusz Olszewski, also set up a special telephone line to coordinate transport of aid to the flood victims. The telephone line was run by the members of the party and would pick up aid packages from those who wanted to help the flood victims but had no time or were located too far away to do so in person.\nOn 14 August 2001, the Supreme Court of Poland ruled that the Polish Electoral Commission had no right to deregister the party, and ordered the commission to accept the electoral committee of the Alternative Social Movement, ruling that the registration in the register of political parties does not have to become final in order for a political party to be able to register an electoral committee. This day also coincided with the deadline for registering electoral committees for the 2001 election, which meant that the party had to register its committee within 9 hours.\nThe Alternative Social Movement presented itself as the movement for dissatisfied and frustrated voters, and built its support amongst trade unions as well as groups of striking miners and steelworkers. It was defined by its harsh criticism of the AWS government as well as the European Union, opposing the Polish membership in the EU on the basis of perceived looming wealth inequality and poverty. It was considered populist and utilized anti-establishment slogans, and visited impoverished regions.\nThe ARS electoral lists included candidates of the following parties:\n\nConfederation of Independent Poland - Patriotic Camp (Polish: Konfederacja Polski Niepodległej - Obóz Patriotyczny): National Catholic party;\nPolish Ecological Party - The Greens (Polish: Polska Partia Ekologiczna – Zielonych): environmentalists;\nThe Poor of Poland (Polish: Biedota Polska: left-wing anti-austerity activists;\nNational Association of Pensioners of the Republic of Poland (Polish: Krajowe Porozumienie Emerytów i Rencistów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej): left-wing pensioner activists;\nNational Revival of Poland: ultra-nationalists;\nMikołajczykowski's Polish People's Party (Polish: Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe Mikołajczykowskie): left-leaning agrarians;\nPolish Front: right-wing nationalists;\na small number of parties (Christian National Union, National Party, Christian Democracy of the Third Polish Republic, Organisation of the Polish Nation - Polish League, most of whose members ran from other committees.\nThe Victoria Party, the Polish Enfranchisement Movement party and other organisations were also associated with the coalition: Free Trade Union \"August 80\", the Polish Western Union, the Kontra Trade Union, the Alliance of New Forces, the National Self-Government Agreement - Ojczyzna, the National-Robotniczy Front or the Association 'No to the European Union'.\nIn total, the Alternative Social Movement was supported by as many as 37 organisations, which had a combined membership of more than half a million. The party focused on the criticism of the Solidarity Electoral Action and the Polish prime minister Jerzy Buzek. The criticism that was directed at Buzek and his government mainly concerned the state of the economy, and the deregulation and privatization measures that the cabinet pursued.\nWith so many members and parties involved, the Alternative Social Movement had a contradicting political position defined by Euroscepticism, anti-Atlanticism, National Catholicism and left-wing nationalism. It even involved far-right parties. As the campaign continued, the party would noticeably shift to the left, with the factions representing the 'national left' gradually dominating the party and its rhetoric.\nThe party hoped to capture 10% of the popular vote. The polls placed the party anywhere between 2% and 8%. Ultimately, in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election on 23 September 2001, it received 54,266 votes, or 0.42%, and did not receive any parliamentary seats.\nOn 11 November 2001 it transformed into a unified political party - the far-left Polish Labour Party - August 80, headed by Daniel Podrzycki from the trade union WZZ \"August 80\", with the vice-presidents then being: Tomasz Karwowski previously from KPN-Ojczyzna, Marek Toczek from the Polish Front, and Bogusław Ziętek from the WZZ \"August 80\". The court re-registered ARS as APP by a decision of 28 February 2002. The core of the new party consisted mainly of activists of the WZZ \"August 80\", who had previously formally been members of the ARS party. In addition, APP was co-founded by parties such as KPN-Ojczyzna and Front Polski. APP renamed itself in 2004 as the Polish Labour Party and PPP in 2009 as Polish Labour Party - August 80.\nThe Polish Labour Party - August 80 became a far-left party, with a socialist, anti-liberal and anti-capitalist program, which reappropiated the demands of the Alternative Social Movement, such as its hostility towards the European Union and the United States. The nationalist rhetoric of the Alternative Social Movement then gave way to radical, anti-capitalist slogans.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== Sejm ===\n\n\n=== Senate ===\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Alternative Social Movement criticised the activities of the Jerzy Buzek. It advocated against Poland's membership in the European Union, and particularly stressed its opposition to the conditions that the Polish government agreed to. The party also opposes Polish membership in NATO structures, as well as being opposed to any cooperation with the United States. The party argued that the Polish membership in the European Union will lead to financial ruin and wealth inequality, and wanted a second referendum in Poland that would decide the issue of European integration.\nIn its opposition to the European Union, the party mixed various criticisms, but the prevailing theme was that of wealth inequality. The Alternative Social Movement stated that Poland has a much weaker economy than the Western countries that dominate the European Union, which will lead to the Polish economy being completely outcompeted by other members of the European Union. The party presented itself as the party of the disattisfied and frustrated, and pursued connections with trade unions as well as invidual groups of striking miners and steelworkers.\nThe party had a conflicting ideology, as the coalition it formed included Catholic nationalists, national conservatives, environmentalists, trade unionists, nationalist socialists as well as left-wing activists. The main ideologies of the Alternative Social Movement were described to be National Catholicism as well as leftist nationalism. Over the course of the campaign, the party's positions veered further to the left, cementing it as a left-wing movement. After the election, the Alternative Social Movement was re-registered as Polish Labour Party - August 80 (PPP). The new party reappropiated the nationalist, anti-European rhetoric of the Alternative Social Movement into radically socialist and anti-capitalist slogans; the party promoted itself as the \"true left\", as opposed to the \"caviar left\" embodied by the Democratic Left Alliance.\nIdeologically, it was also compared to other nationalist parties with distinct programs in Polish politics, such as the far-right League of Polish Families as well as the far-left Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona). Alternative Social Movement was a mixture of Catholic nationalist and left-wing nationalist circles, and sharply criticized the cabinet of Buzek for its neoliberal policy. League of Polish Families was a purely Catholic nationalist party and likewise attacked the government, taking an anti-capitalist stance. Lastly, socialist Samoobrona presented the interests of all impoverished social groups, especially the farmers, pensioners and unemployed - similarly to the Alternative Social Movement, Samoobrona opposed Polish membership in the EU on the basis of the European Union's neoliberal policies and wealth inequality.\nAs PPP, the party describes itself as a socialist grouping, with anti-liberal and anti-capitalist slogans. It party calls for a complete halt to privatisation, advocates free education and health care as well as a welfare state, a 35-hour working week and a minimum wage of 68% of the national average wage. It opposes the introduction of a flat tax, the reinstatement of the death penalty and condemns pro-American and pro-EU policies. It also calls for abolition of income tax for the poorest and an economic program that would redistribute the national income from the richest to the poorest, arguing that under the capitalist economy, the opposite process takes place, where the rich are getting wealthier at expense of the poor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSelf-Defence of the Republic of Poland\nLeague and Self-Defence\nNational Party \"Fatherland\"\nConfederation of Independent Poland\nLeague of Polish Families\nSocial Justice Movement\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "Matti Milius (November 10, 1945 – June 3, 2015) was an Estonian art collector. He lived in Tartu and was one of the biggest collectors of Estonian and Baltic contemporary art and a curator of art exhibitions. Milius owned a large collection of bookplates, graphics, and paintings consisting of more than 1,200 works. From 1968 onward, Milius exhibited works from his collection at exhibitions in Estonia and abroad.\n\n\n== Education and early years ==\nMatti Milius attended Tartu High School No. 1 for Young Workers (now Tartu Adult High School), where he graduated in 1967. He attended the Viljandi School of Cultural Education, where he majored in librarianship, and he graduated in 1969.\nThe Milius art collection started in 1962 thanks to a classmate's mother, Helene Ivask-Kulpa, who was the daughter of the literary scholar and bookplate researcher Udo-Nestor Ivask. She gave Milius a bookplate every time the young man got a good grade in science, English, or Russian. In 1966, Milius met the art collector Mart Lepp, at whose initiative he became interested in older Estonian graphics. Peeter Urbla sparked Milius's interest in contemporary art in 1968.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1970 to 1980, Milius was engaged in samizdat, copying and distributing the works of several authors on a typewriter, and publishing self-published collections, including the almanacs Karjamaa (Pasture) and Sõna (Word). He was under constant surveillance by the KGB.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Matti Milius also worked as a performance artist and poetry performer, being one half of the poetry duo Matti Moguči and Matti Moguchi (Priidu Beier wrote poetry for Moguči and Albert Trapeež for Moguchi).\nIn 2006, Matti Milius organized an exhibition festival in Tartu and Kaunas, where the works of dozens of Kaunas artists were shown in Tartu and those of Tartu artists in Kaunas. Before his death, Milius mainly focused on contemporary art from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Armenia.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nMatti Milius was a member of the Tartu Artists' Association and Estonian Artists' Association.\n\n\n== Recognitions and awards ==\n2003: Honorary title of Tartu Bearer of Culture in the producer category\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia capillosa, commonly known as hispid velleia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is native to inland areas of Western Australia and South Australia. It is an annual herb with covered with soft hairs, and has narrowly egg-shaped to narrowly elliptic leaves with toothed or lyre-shaped edges, and yellow flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia capillosa is an annual herb with erect stems up to 16 cm (6.3 in) long. Its leaves are narrowly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, or narrowly elliptic, 50–80 mm (2.0–3.1 in) long and 12–20 mm (0.47–0.79 in) wide with toothed to lyre-shaped edges. The flowers are yellow with bracteoles up to 20 mm (0.79 in) long with the lower sepal 5 mm (0.20 in) long. The petals wings are about half as long as the lower sepal. Flowering mainly occurs from July to November and the fruit is a more or less spherical capsule containing seeds about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) in diameter with wings about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1904 by William Vincent Fitzgerald who gave it the name Velleia hispida in the Journal of the West Australian Natural History Society. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd transferred it to the genus Goodenia. As the name Goodenia hispida (now known as Goodenia auriculata) was unavailable, the new species was given the name G. capillosa in the journal PhytoKeys.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGoodenia capillosa grows in drier communities from near Laverton to Meekatharra and the Great Victoria Desert, in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison and Yalgoo of Western Australia and in the Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area in South Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Descanse is a corregiment in the south of the department of Cauca in the region known as Media Bota Caucana, municipality of Santa Rosa located near the borders of Cauca with the department of Putumayo. Descanse has a population of 1,326 inhabitants including the rural area. The town was settled around year 1560. Despite its antiquity (around 460 years), it is one of the most isolated towns of the department of Cauca due to its location in the Colombian Massif and the lack of access roads since it is only connected to other population centers through horseshoe tracks.\n\n\n== History of the name ==\nEarly anonymous colonial reports from around year 1560 report the existence of the town of Descanse, the town was also referred to as Discanzé or Discancé. In 1582 Fray Jerónimo de Escobar reported the existence of this population with the name of Yscanzé, name which according to oral tradition referred to an Inca chief who lead a group of Inca people through Colombian Massif around year 1560. The most recent reports refer to this town as Descanse or Descansé. The name Descansé is formed from the distortion of the word Yscansé which was also written Iscancé or Iscansé and which then became Discancé or Discansé and finally Descanse.\n\n\n== History ==\nDescanse is one of the oldest towns in the region, its existence begins to be recorded between 1550 and 1566 in anonymous reports with the name of Yscansé with a population of 5,000 indigenous people, By year 1572, during the Hispanic fundation (attributed to Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca and Captain Bartolomé Ruiz) the population had already been reduced to 2,000 people, of whom a part were later taken to work in the gold mines. Between 1730 and 1780 the town depended administratively on Almaguer. In year 1756, when the Franciscan Father Juan de Santa Gertrudis arrived at the place, Yscansé was renamed San Juan de Trujillo, by this time, the population had already been reduced to 12 families; Starting in 1820, with the withdrawal of the Spanish missionaries due to the independence of New Granada, Descanse, as well as Santa Rosa, fell into abandonment, until the discovery of cinchona trees and its trade attracted numerous settlers from Cauca. The arrival of Fray Isidoro de Montclar in 1904 was an important moment due to his contribution to the development of the community. Around 1915, the town was moved to its current location with the name Descanse and the site that was left uninhabited was called Pueblo Viejo (Old Town)\". Descanse began to prosper and be repopulated; its first buildings, which are still preserved, have a colonial style, the houses are very large with two floors with balconies and large backyards almost the size of a city block.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe population of Descanse dedicate themselves to agriculture and livestock farming as well as gold panning in the Cascabel River, located 5 kilometers from the town which is very rich in gold.\nDescanse is traditionally an agricultural and cattle region; due to its mountain climate diversity, the lands are very productive; Almost everyone have their farm where they cultivate at ease. They cultivate tapioca, banana, beans, corn, peanuts, chontaduro, arracacha, pumpkin, yota, cocoa, sugar cane, among others; There is also a variety of fruits that include orange, avocado, lemon, mandarin, caimarón grape, soursop, guava, lulo, tree tomato, custard apple, papaya, guama, pineapple, piñuela, blueberry, arbutus, arazá and borojó among others.\nThe agricultural products are obtained for self-consumption and barter, as its commerce is hindered by the lack of the roads. However, the products of livestock farming and mining are well established and are sold directly in the capital of Putumayo, which generates a form of income to the locals.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nDescanse is located in the region known as Bota Caucana region, which is one of the most biodiverse destinations of Colombia and attractive for the practice of birdwatching and other ecotourism alternatives.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the inhabitants belong to the Inga and Yanacona ethnic groups. The Inga or Inganos inhabit the San José reservation, which is located two hours away from the center of the town. There are also peasant settlers who arrived in the region in the 1950s.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAdministratively, the corregiment of Descanse is divided in 10 veredas (rural settlements) with Descanse as its capital.\n\nLa Cristalina\nEl Encanto\nLa Primavera\nSanta Clara\nLa Isla\nEl Cascajo\nResguardo San José\nLa Esperanza\nSanta Rita\nDescanse\nDescanse is located on a small plateau surrounded by mountains with an altitude of 900 meters above sea level, and an average temperature of 25 degrees.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cometh the Storm is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band High on Fire, released on April 19, 2024, through MNRK Heavy. It marks their first album with Coady Willis of Big Business on drums since the departure of co-founder Des Kensel in July 2019. It follows a five-year gap from Electric Messiah and mixes the band's previous sludge metal and stoner metal genres with Turkish folk music. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting at Blabbermouth.net, Dom Lawson rated this album an 8.5 out of 10, stating that High on Fire \"deliver the punishment that their admirers crave\". In Kerrang!, Nick Russell scored Cometh the Storm 4 out of 5, summing up, \"when [High on Fire] stampede at you like this, when you can hear their blood pumping and smell their breath, there are few bands on Earth who can match them\". Max Morin of Metal Injection rated this release an 8 out of 10, stating that the music \"avoids the pitfalls that many of High On Fire's imitators have stumbled into, mainly letting the music relax into a slow motion dirge\" and it \"keeps the momentum going with drum fills, crashing cymbals and an absolutely ripping guitar solo\". Another 4 out of 5 came from Mandy Scythe of MetalSucks who wrote that \"there really isn't a dull moment on this album, as it almost acts as a retrospective of what the band has done so far and takes you through a lot of different crucial eras of their development\". Online retailer Qobuz named this Album of the Week and critic Eli Enis ended that the band \"sound as heavy, gnarly, and gloriously sludgy as they ever have\". Editors at Stereogum chose this as Album of the Week, where critic Chris DeVille stated that \"stoner metal is... rarely so dynamic\" and summed up that \"it's right in this band's sweet spot: grotesque enough for the most dedicated hesher, but bracingly immediate enough to sweep up the heavy metal dilettante in its current\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Lambsbread\" – 5:45\n\"Burning Down\" – 6:13\n\"Trismegistus\" – 5:37\n\"Cometh the Storm\" – 6:12\n\"Karanlık Yol\" – 3:47\n\"Sol's Golden Curse\" – 4:52\n\"The Beating\" – 2:29\n\"Tough Guy\" – 3:44\n\"Lightning Beard\" – 3:34\n\"Hunting Shadows\" – 5:41\n\"Darker Fleece\" – 9:59\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nHigh on Fire\n\nJeff Matz – bass guitar, guitar, baglama, Mellotron, percussion, audio engineering, production\nMatt Pike – guitar, vocals, production\nCoady Willis – drums, percussion, vocals, engineering, production\nAdditional personnel\n\nKurt Ballou – recording, mixing, production\nRich Doucette – dilruba on \"Karanlik Yol\"\nAlan Douches – audio mastering\nBrandon Eggleston – engineering\nZach Weeks – engineering\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 in American music\n2024 in heavy metal music\nList of 2024 albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCometh the Storm at Discogs (list of releases) \nCometh the Storm at MusicBrainz (list of releases) \nEntry at Encyclopaedia Metallum",

After auditioning, Miyata joined Johnny & Associates on February 4, 2001. Wataru Yokoo and Takashi Nikaido, who would later become members of Kis-My-Ft2, also participated in the same audition.\nAfter joining several groups as a trainee (Johnny's Jr.), he was selected as a member of Kis-My-Ft2 in 2005 and made his CD debut with \"Everybody Go\" on August 10, 2011, seven years after their formation.\nIn April 2012, he made his first appearance in a drama series on Nippon Television's \"Shiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō\", and in October of the same year, he made his first film appearance in its film version, \"Shiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō — The Movie(劇場版 私立バカレア高校)\".\nIn May 2013, he played his first starring role on stage in \"Adventure in the Land of Kifsham\"(キフシャム国の冒険). \nOn December the same year, Busaiku was formed from Kis-My-Ft2 with Kento Senga, Wataru Yokoo and Takashi Nikaido produced by Masahiro Nakai who was a member of SMAP.\nEven before his debut, he professed his love of anime (anime geek: \"otaku\"), which is unusual for an idol at the time.

Sandoval is a 1974 opinion by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York that \"trial court must balance the 'probative worth of evidence of prior specific criminal, vicious or immoral acts on the issue of the defendant's credibility on the one hand, and on the other the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant'\". (Court citations: People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (N.Y. 1974)). \nSandoval pre-trial hearings (the procedure is unique to New York state) allow the accused to make an informed decision as to whether to testify given that it sets the scope of cross-examination.  A presumably probative result of a Sandoval hearing has been termed \"a Sandoval\".   \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeople vs. Sandoval at nycourts.gov",

        "content": "The 2023 MPL Philippines season was the sixth year of professional Esports competitions for the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League of the Philippines (referred to as: MPL Philippines). The 2023 season features two seasonal splits: MPL Philippines Season 11 and MPL Philippines Season 12. It was during this year that the inaugural Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Development League was introduced to the Philippines with MDL Philippines Season 1 occurring as the preceding event prior to MPL Philippines Season 11.\nMPL Philippines Season 11 was the first season for the year 2023 and was the first professional season for the league after the MLBB M4 World Championships. Defending champions Blacklist International were beaten by the M4 World Champions ECHO Philippines during the Season 11 Grand Finals and was the first sweep by a team in the Finals since Season 1 between Aether Main and Digital Devils Pro Team. ECHO and Blacklist would qualify as the two teams of the Philippines to the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Southeast Asia Cup (MSC 2023) in Cambodia. Blacklist International would boast the best performance by a Filipino team in the aforementioned competition as the team loss 4–2 to Indonesian team ONIC Esports with two Filipino imports in Kairi Rayosdelsol and Yeb Miranda. ECHO Philippines finished in third place, defeating home-team BURN x FLASH, 3–2.\nMPL Philippines Season 12 began in September 2023, 4 months after the Grand Finals match of MPL Philippines Season 11. Season 12 was the qualifying tournament for the Philippines to the MLBB M5 World Championships that will be played on home soil. Defending world champions and MPL champions ECHO Philippines failed to defend their world title and MPL title after losing to Blacklist International, who has included the services of Renejay \"Renejay\" Barcase to the roster, 3–1 in the Lower Bracket Finals to qualify for M5. Blacklist International is the only team in the Philippines to qualify for three-consecutive world championship series, appearing since the M3 World Championship which the team won. AP Bren would defeat Blacklist International in the Grand Finals 4–1 to give the organization its second MPL title. Furthermore, AP Bren would win the M5 World Championships on home soil as they defeat Indonesia's ONIC Esports 4–3 in the Grand Finals, making them the only organization thus far to win two world championships.\nDuring the 2023 season, Filipino teams have won one M-World Series titles and one MPLI Invitational titles with RSG Philippines defeating ECHO in an all-Filipino Grand Finals.\n\n\n== Season 11 ==\n\n\n=== Participating teams ===\nMPL Philippines Season 11 features the same eight (8) franchise teams that have previously competed during MPL Philippines Season 10.\n\n\n=== Regular season ===\n\n\n==== Format ====\nAll participating teams will participate in a double round-robin tournament format in the eight-week duration of MPL Philippines Season 11.

(Bren Esports' 4–0 record over Blacklist International denotes that in the two matches that both teams have faced off against each other, AP Bren has won 4 matches and lost 0 to Blacklist).\n\n\n==== Playoff bracket ====\nMPL Philippines Season 11 was ECHO Philippines' first MPL title since the team rebranded from SunSparks to AURA Philippines to simply ECHO Philippines. This is also the first season where the defending champions were defeated in their attempt of a back-to-back campaign.\n\n\n==== Final standings ====\n\n\n== Season 12 ==\nMPL Philippines Season 12 was the succeeding professional season following MSC 2023. Season 12's regular season began on 8 September and concluded with the Grand Finals on 29 October 2023.

        "content": "Wrists Tied is a 2023 American comedy short film co-written, produced, and directed by Joseph Jeavons. It stars Beckett Nichols as the protagonist alongside Sam Teague, Calvin Lewis, and Hank Holbrook. The story sees Melvin, a recent college graduate, help an odd crew of criminals execute a poorly planned heist so that he can afford to start up his dream business.\nThe film premiered in Dallas, Texas on July 30, 2023.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMelvin and Doug are two college graduates who are struggling financially. Melvin takes the steps needed to start up his dream business, \"Paint Cinema,\" where audience members can paint while they watch movies, but he fails to obtain sufficient funds to pay off his property expenses. Rather than finding a reasonable solution to this issue, Melvin goes behind Doug's back and joins a crew of criminals led by Dagwood and accompanied by Leg Hair Nelson.\nThe three of them execute a bank heist that goes wrong when the cops show up unexpectedly and Leg Hair Nelson's uncontrollable urge to start plucking out their leg hairs kicks in. Melvin and Dagwood escape and Dagwood is now suspicious about how the cops could have caught onto their plans so swiftly. Once the two regroup, Melvin is surprised to see the whistle-blower tied to a chair with a bag over his head. Dagwood reveals the culprit to be Doug and gives Melvin the choice to either kill Doug or be killed.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBeckett Nichols as Melvin, a college graduate with a dream to revolutionize art itself.\nHank Holbrook as Doug, Melvin's best friend and ladies' man.\nSam Teague as Dagwood, a criminal mastermind.\nCalvin Lewis as Leg Hair Nelson, a peculiar member of Dagwood's crew who has an uncontrollable urge to pluck people's leg hair.\n\n\n=== Voice Cast ===\nJoseph Jeavons as Patrick, a former member of Dagwood's crew whose face was beaten with a brick.\nAnna Winslow as Margo, Melvin's real estate agent.\nSavannah Wells as the female police officer\nHoward May as the male police officer\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film began development in June 2023, with a writing team composed of Owen Swift and Joseph Jeavons. Writing began just three months after the team's release of The Big Pelvis earlier that year. In an interview with Ashalia Dawkins of The Student World Impact Film Festival, Swift and Jeavons explained that once they finish wrapping a project they get straight into brainstorming their next.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWrists Tied garnered mixed reviews given that its ultra-low budget indie quality clashed with the twenty-two-minute story. Richard Propes of The Independent Critic wrote, \"If you're expecting studio quality filmmaking here, look elsewhere. If you're looking for solid storytelling from a filmmaker still figuring things out then you should be absolutely happy with this fun little story, engaging characters, and microcinema spirit.\"  The film was given the Award of Recognition in the September 2023 round of the Best Shorts Competition as well as the Best Short Film Award at the Creative Vision Film Festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWrists Tied at IMDb",

UGC 4881, the brighter, is a peculiar spiral galaxy. It has been heavily documented by the Hubble Space Telescope, and is cataloged in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nUGC 4881 was first given the nickname \"The Grasshopper\" by astrophysicist Dr. Boris Vorontsov-Velyaminov in a 1977 paper due to its resemblance to a grasshopper larva. It has also been informally called the \"Shrimp galaxy\" due to the curvature of the arm resembling a shrimp.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe two galaxy cores are the two brightest regions in the object. The cores of each merging galaxy are separated and distinct, but the disks of the galaxies have started to merge. Intense star formation is occurring, as seen by the bright blue line of clusters along the grasshopper's \"tail\". Three other faint galaxies are visible near UGC 4881 and form a group with it.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nUGC 4881 is believed to be in the process of merging, but the discs of the parent galaxies are overlapping while the cores are separated. A supernova exploded inside of UGC 4881 in 1999 and the galaxy is in the beginning of star formation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHalton Arp\nStarburst galaxy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Swanson (born April 26, 1980) is an American professional stock car racing driver who has previously competed in the ARCA Menards Series, with a majority of his starts being with Wayne Peterson Racing. He has also competed in the ASA National Tour.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 2012, Swanson made his ARCA Racing Series in 2012, driving the No. 0 Ford for Wayne Peterson Racing at Berlin Raceway, finishing 26th due to a rear-end failure. He would make three more starts that year, with his best finish out of those starts being 18th at Madison International Speedway.\nIn 2013, Swanson ran all but one race (that being the season opener at Daytona International Speedway) for Wayne Peterson, primarily driving the team's No. 0 and No. 06 entries. He only finished four of those races and earned a best finish of sixteenth at Winchester Speedway, although he failed to finish that race due to a multi-car crash late in the event. He finished thirteenth in the final standings.\nSwanson remained with Peterson for the 2014 season, driving in all but three races on the schedule. He occupied the same rides as he did last year, and earned a best finish of twelfth at Madison and Salem Speedway, and finished ninth in the final points standings. In the final race of the year at Kansas Speedway, Swanson was involved in a multi-car accident on lap 72, where he drove into the side of the car of Austin Wayne Self at near full speed whilst trying to slow down. Both drivers were able to escape without serious injury.\nIn 2015, Swanson ran the full schedule, starting the season with Wayne Peterson Racing for the first five races before moving to James Hylton Motorsports as a replacement for Brad Smith, who was injured in a crash at Talladega Superspeedway, for all but New Jersey Motorsports Park, where he drove for Kimmel Racing. Through his time with Hylton, Swanson achieved three top-tens with a best finish of eighth at Winchester Speedway, and finished ninth in points again. Swanson and Hylton had originally planned to run again in 2016, driving in the fall race at Salem Speedway and potentially more races pending sponsorship, although nothing would materialize, and Swanson would not run any ARCA races in 2016. He then returned to the series in 2017, driving in three events, with the first being at Berlin Raceway driving for Fast Track Racing in the No. 10 Dodge, and the other two at Chicagoland Speedway and Kentucky Speedway, driving for Wayne Peterson Racing.\nAfter not racing from 2018 to 2022, Swanson entered the ASA National Tour race at Wisconsin International Raceway, driving the No. 7NJ entry, where he started and finished in 27th after running only eighteen laps due to mechanical issues.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Racing Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time. Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time. * – Most laps led.)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJames Swanson driver statistics at Racing-Reference",

        "content": "Lampo (\"Lightning\") was the lead ship of the Italian Lampo-class destroyers. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1900, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1920.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nDardo was laid down at the Schichau-Werke in Elbing in the German Empire on 6 May 1899 as the lead ship the Lampo class destroyers. She was launched on 7 October 1899 and completed and commissioned on 23 June 1900.\nLampo and her five sister ships formed the first class of destroyers built for the Regia Marina, their only predecessor, Fulmine, having been a one-off. Designed by the German Schichau-Werke shipyard, they were seaworthy, robust, fast, and reliable, although they were afflicted by serious problems with seakeeping. \n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nLampo participated actively in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the outbreak of war, Lampo was part of the 2nd Squadron's 1st Division, which also included her sister ships Euro, Freccia, and Ostro.  On 31 October 1911, she and the armored cruiser Carlo Alberto bombarded Ottoman-held Fort Hamidje, which had been shelling Italian positions at Tripoli in Ottoman Tripolitania, and silenced its guns. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Lampo, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Castiglioni, Euro, Ostro, and their sister ships Dardo and Strale made up the 4th Destroyer Squadron, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) F. Gambardella. Lampo and Ostro were based at Tripoli in Italian Tripolitania when Italy declared war.\nBy 1915, the Lampo-class destroyers were of antiquated design and had only limited military usefulness. During World War I, however, they were modified, having equipment installed to carry and lay 12 mines, drop depth charges, and tow explosive paravanes. The Lampo-class ships spent the war on escort duty.\nLampo took part in no significant actions during her World War I service. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nLampo was stricken from the naval register on 18 March 1920.  She was discarded the same day and subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of destroyers of Italy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W. H.

        "content": "Rural Resistance in the Land of Zapata: The Jaramillista Movement and the Myth of the Pax Priísta, 1940–1962 (2008) is a non-fiction book by Latin Americanist historian Tanalís Padilla. It was published by Duke University Press.\nThe book covers leftist militant Rubén Jaramillo, follower of Emiliano Zapata, under the Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) one-party state. Dissatisfied by the PRI's poor adherence the ideals of the Mexican Revolution, principally land reform, Jaramillo raised a movement.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIt was widely praised for its bibliography, including original interviews and official documents. Its analysis is recognized as influenced by the theories of Antonio Gramsci.\nHistorian Benjamin Smith underscored its importance for countering the narrative of peace under the PRI, centering women's participation in resistance, and contextualizing rural revolts in their national and international leftist space. However, he questioned the accuracy of Padilla's depiction of how frequently the state resorted to violence, but recognized cross-verifiability would be difficult since Mexican historiography has prioritized the post-revolutionary period (c. 1920–1940). He concluded it was a revisionist or neo-Gramscian work.\nHistorian Helga Baitenmann also commended Padilla's inclusion of women in the movement and illuminating resistance to the PRI in a period where its influence is typically described as \"hegemonic\". However, she deemed Padilla's depiction of the ejido and general society-state relations regarding agriculture as \"simplistic\", citing page 41 when summarizing her position as beneficiaries being \"clients of the state and, by extension, of the newly emerging official party.\" Baitenmann contrasted it to the \"nuanced\" position of Jonathan Fox and Gustavo Gordillo, wherein ejidos served as a mechanism of state control but occasionally one for independence. Overall, she regarded the work as valuable and its flaws potential for further inquiry rather than major faults.\nHistorian Paul Gillingham contends that despite Padilla's self-description as post-revisionist, she centers revisionist analysis of \"social, political, and economic structures\". As such, he claimed it corroborates Jeffrey Rubin's (1997) rejection of mid-century stability as a corporatist myth. He underlined her application of Neo-Gramscian give-and-take analysis in state-society relations, with Padilla recognizing it diminished in the 1940s and calling President Miguel Alemán Valdés \"authoritarian\". However, he saw her positions occasionally simplistic, depicting Jaramillo against the state in a \"David and Goliath\" manner. He stated she was part of a \"vanguard of scholars\" who center violence for the period. He further rejected his reduction to solely resistant, citing Jaramillo's job grant after amnesty; that his integration of women was unique for the time, and the characterization of his militant mobilization as forming focos, reaffirming Eric Hobsbawm's (1952) thesis that it was \"collective bargaining by riot\" rather than \"guerrilla warfare\".\n\nOther reviews:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAgrarianism in Mexico\nHistory of Mexico\nZapatismo\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAt Internet Archive\nAt Project MUSE",

She is currently employed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is the author of Rural Resistance in the Land of Zapata (2008) and Unintended Lessons of Revolution (2021).\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe was born in Mexico City, but spent most of her childhood in Tapaxco. Her parents were Marxists and her mother was a teacher. After finishing elementary school, her family immigrated to Culver City, California.\nIn 1995, she got her bachelor's degree at Pomona College; entering her undergraduate program there expecting to pursue political science or international relations, her history classes under Sidney Lemelle and Miguel Tinker Salas at Pomona and Cindy Forster at Scripps College shaped her worldview. Consequently, she switched her major to history. In 1998, she achieved her master's degree at the University of California, San Diego, obtaining her PhD from there in 2001. She then taught as a visiting professor at Pomona, became a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, tenured professor at Dartmouth College, and now has been working at MIT since 2015.\nShe is currently writing a book on Cuban medical internationalism, which she previously commented on when praising the vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAdditionally co-editing the 2013 special issue of the Journal of Iberian and Latin American Research and contributing to Mexican newspaper La Jornada, her bibliography includes:\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistoriography of Latin America\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHer articles at La Jornada\nHer articles at Janata Weekly",

The neon sign stands in front the YMCA in downtown Fargo, North Dakota.\n\n\n== History ==\nStarting in 1959, fundraising began for the Fargo-Moorhead Family YMCA and contributions totaled $1.2 million. This was the first time over a million dollars had been donated for a project in the history Fargo. The new branch opened in 1962 with 801 members. \n\nThe Cook Sign Company constructed the sign in 1962, just after the building opened. In the subsequent years, Cook increasingly shifted toward producing similar electric signs because the 1965 Highway Beautification Act sharply reduced their sale of billboards. The local Fargo business lasted much longer than most signage companies, operating from 1897 to 2009.\nIn 2009, the YMCA of Cass and Clay Counties changed the name of the branch to the \"Fercho Family YMCA\". This honored Dr. Cal and Doris Fercho, two long-term benefactors.\nIn 2022, the national YMCA issued new branding guidelines to chapters which disallowed leaving up any exceptions. In order to preserve the non-conforming sign, the local YMCA successfully applied for listing it on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe aluminum sign is representative of 1960s Americana and consists of a \"Y\" on a post. The serif font letter is 16 feet wide and 18 feet tall. The sides are cherry red, the faces are white, and a neon tubing runs along the edges.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of YMCA buildings\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cass County, North Dakota\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Romance de la negra rubia is a novella by Argentine writer Gabriela Cabezón Cámara, published in 2014 by publishing house Eterna Cadencia. The plot follows the story of a poetess who sets herself on fire to avoid being evicted from a building by the police, a fact that makes her famous and allows her to help her community and then launch an international tour as a performance artist.\nThrough parody and irony, the novella explores themes such as power relations, political demagoguery, and traditional ideas of romantic love. It also addresses popular religiosity as a transgressive force in society and the value given to sacrifices and the dead as a bargaining chip to obtain favors or benefits from groups in power.\nAccording to Cabezón Cámara, the book is part of a sort of \"dark trilogy\" along with her two previous works: La Virgen Cabeza (2009) and Le viste la cara a Dios (2011). The idea of referring to her work as a \"dark trilogy\" was suggested by the author herself and then picked up in various interviews and reviews.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nGabi is a poetess within a commune of artists who are living in a building as okupas (squatters). When the police try to evict them, she decides to set fire to herself as a form of resistance, an event that is captured by television cameras. Gabi manages to survive the burns and becomes a popular heroine. At first, she is used as a symbol by political groups, but she later learns to utilize her power with the media to obtain benefits for her community.\nShe soon launches an international tour as a performance artist, in which her disfigured body is the main attraction. Thus, she arrives at the Venice Biennale, where she meets Elena, a Swiss millionaire who buys the installation in which Gabi was traveling and who begins a love affair with her. Some time later, Elena dies due to an illness and leaves Gabi the skin of her face so that she can transplant it onto hers. Thanks to the power she has gained, Gabi manages to gift her former housemates with houses of their own and she is later elected governor of Buenos Aires Province. Once her term ends, she decides to retire and lead a quiet life in the city of Tigre, where she writes this story and lives with two European men in a polyamorous relationship.\n\n\n== Main characters ==\nGabi: she is the protagonist of the story and the negra rubia of the title. According to Montes, the character embodies the social construct of a powerful, lower-class woman who gives her life for her people, not unlike Eva Perón, a negra rubia just like her. Montes adds that comparisons can also be drawn between the narrator and the stories surrounding Argentine political leader Milagro Sala and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the former president of Argentina. In this sense, being negra implies having working-class origins, while becoming rubia is to gain political power. Gabi is a poetess that sets herself alight to avoid being evicted from a building she had arrived at because there were people there offering whiskey and cocaine. Due to the severity of the burns, she spends a year in the hospital. Upon her release, she becomes a leader in her community and starts to gain favors for herself in negotiations with the authorities. Gabi is constantly observing the events that surround her from a cynical point of view with which she identifies the hypocrisy of the people with whom she interacts, although, at the same time, she gets carried away by circumstances with a passive attitude, summed up by the phrase da igual, nada tiene sentido Among the characters to whom she is compared in the novel due to either her physical appearance or the power she achieves are: Darth Vader, Eva Perón, and Marina Abramović. In an interview, Cabezón Cámara described Gabi's character as follows:\nEs una especie de descerebrada, está pasada de rosca, reloca y va aprendiendo cómo construir poder político para beneficiar a su comuna y a sí misma con el tiempo.\nElena: she is an art collector, originally from Switzerland, who buys the art installation in which Gabi was participating and who becomes her lover. When she dies of cancer, she leaves part of her fortune to Gabi along with her face, so she can have it transplanted onto her own face. Gabi falls in love with her por alta, por rubia, por musculosa, por llevar la ropa de lino con elegancia and describes her as a woman who is ligera y fuerte.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\nThe original idea for the book was born in February 2002, when Cabezón Cámara read a press article published in Argentine newspaper Clarín in the context of the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The article included a photograph of a man who had set himself on fire. The man's name was Rubén Arias and he was a 31-year-old newspaper delivery man, a resident of Neuquén, who had threatened to set himself alight if the police tried to evict him from the subsidized housing in which he lived. The police had dismissed his threat, and so Arias set fire to himself and caused everyone around him to flee, a moment that was captured in the photograph.\nArias remained hospitalized for about 15 days before dying. This incident sparked clashes between the police and the remaining people who were evicted, but days later the local authorities decided to provide them with housing on the condition that couples living together had to get married. This piqued Cabezón Cámara's curiosity and made her think that Arias's death had served as a sort of sacrifice that had been accepted by the authorities in Neuquén to provide those evicted with houses, in the style of the Greek gods.\nThis idea was one of the two that Cabezón Cámara later submitted to Diana Bellessi, who suggested that she first work on the one that would become La Virgen Cabeza, published in 2009 by Eterna Cadencia. Years later, Cabezón Cámara took up again the idea for Romance de la negra rubia and wrote a first version of the novella, narrated in the third person, which she ended up discarding as she considered that the prose she used was too rough and violent. The second version of the manuscript was the one that eventually became the final version of the book.\nThe novella is written in the first person and is made up of brief chapters of no more than three pages each. It also has an epilogue and a coda.\n\n\n== Central themes ==\n\n\n=== The social role of sacrifice ===\nOne of the central themes of the book is the social role of sacrifice as a record of the struggle in favor of communities, although it also criticizes the negative impact it has had throughout history and its exploitation by political actors. At the beginning, Gabi's sacrificio fundante serves as the primordial act that creates her community's shared identity and provides them with a sense of belonging. The sense of nosotros that they had managed until then becomes a nuestro in relation to the community ownership of the building in which they live. This social movement created around the figure of Gabi also allows her to gain political power and thus pressure the judge who had previously evicted them into providing them all with the title deeds of the building.\nHowever, Gabi observes with skepticism the meaning of her own sacrifice and realizes that it has been appropriated by groups in power as a way to increase their political capital. She specifically calls out the Justicialist Party as one of the sectors attempting to take advantage of her condition of being medio muerta in a similar manner as had been done with the victims of forced disappearance during the military dictatorship in Argentina, whose memory is identified by Gabi as one of the foundations of the political power of Peronism:\n\nMe usaba bastante el juez y quiso usarme el Pejota para sumarme a la masa, nunca yerta ni acabada, de su mayor capital: el plantel de muertos vivos.\n\nMoreover, Cabezón Cámara analyzes Gabi's situation and makes a historical overview in which she identifies the symbolic power of sacrifices to bring benefits to the community to which the sacrificed party belongs. Among the examples she mentions are the sacrifice of Iphigenia at the hands of her father Agamemnon to secure the blessing from the gods, the birth of agriculture after Cain killed Abel, and even the Holocaust which, among its immediate effects, led to the creation of Israel. In short, the author identifies a sort of general law in which the dead have been used throughout history as a bargaining chip to obtain benefits for their respective communities. And even more than that, Cabezón Cámara claims that the people who have been tortured the most they themselves later victimize others under the pretext of the exchange value in the number of dead they have accumulated. As some examples, she mentions the abuses perpetrated by the Israel Defense Forces in Palestine and the crucifixion of Jesus, which centuries later would wreak havoc through the evangelism that took place during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The author asks herself the question ¿Llama la herencia del mártir al martirio de los otros? regarding this point.\nThe novella also points out that these foundational sacrifices have served to normalize pernicious aspects of present-day societies. In the case of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Agamemnon's victory legitimizes the gender violence she is subjected to, and grants men a symbolic right over the lives of their wives and daughters. The fact that Iphigenia was burned alive does not go unnoticed in Cabezón Cámara's writing, as she makes a reference to it in the case of Gabi herself and in the case of the women murdered in Argentina by burning.\n\n\n=== Popular religiosity ===\nReligion is another major theme in the book, especially the concept of popular sainthood. Throughout the novella, Gabi takes on the role of martyr, and her self-immolation is repeatedly described using religious terms, such as mito del origen and sacrificio fundante. The second chapter, which is precisely titled Cómo me hice santa, narrates the exact moment in which Gabi's sacrifice becomes the symbol of struggle for her community. The fact that all of the building's inhabitants manage to be given housing after the sacrifice is later considered a miracle, while Gabi's screams at the police telling them they would never enter the building are interpreted as a prophecy that is fulfilled when they are killed due to their own criminal actions.\nThe establishment of Gabi as a popular saint allows her to turn into an opposing force to political power by positioning herself, first, as a defender of the community of bohemian artists, and later, of the dispossessed classes that take part in the squatter movement, even if that was never her original goal. This concept of a transgressive popular religiosity is a recurring theme in Cabezón Cámara's narrative, also present in her previous works: La Virgen Cabeza (2009) and Le viste la cara a Dios (2011).\nThe author also criticizes several aspects of traditional religious institutions, including hierarchical structures and power relations where los de arriba (referring to the upper classes) are los que están cerca del cielo, los más cercanos a Dios. When Gabi starts to be considered a saint, she herself is elevated by her followers and goes on to live in the top floor of the building, from where she rarely comes down and from where she can talk with powerful people as an equal. The novella also suggests that the religious idea of the sagrado is intrinsically linked to these power relations and the need for sacrifice, by claiming that [lo] que lleva de Cristo al Vaticano are los muertos que llevamos en la espalda.\n\n\n=== Romantic love and sexism ===\n\nThe love affair between Gabi and Elena is constantly depicted in the novella in terms of a parody. From the moment they meet, and Gabi is lovestruck by Elena, her attraction is described with irony, such as when she says that what has happened to her is exactly what happens lo que a tanto negro, that is, falling in love with Elena's features that are specific to her condition as a white, wealthy European woman. Once they begin their relationship, they live for a few months in Venice, which Gabi describes as having come out of romantic postales, in which she stresses the luxury and money that Elena surrounds her with, referring to her as her princesa. According to Professor Agnieszka Flisek, Gabi's relationship draws a queer analogue to the classic fairy tale of Cinderella, in which a lower-class woman falls in love with a wealthy prince who fits the social standards of what is considered attractive.\nMoreover, the scene in which they meet is narrated using terms inspired by telenovelas, with exaggerated references to atardeceres, poema rosa, and the expectation built by capítulos y capítulos towards what would eventually be an intercambio de fluidos. The melodramatic nature of the story is emphasized when Elena reveals to her that she will die soon of her illness. Faced with Gabi's exaggerated reaction, it is Elena herself who reprimands her:\n\n\"Cáncer\", me dijo, \"no se cura\". Y yo que en asado había mutado muté en mujer de Lot (...) me desmoroné y mientras caía hice mierda medio pabellón argentino: ahí sí me desplomé, caí en picada, me rompí. Elena miró, quieta, callada hasta que terminé de caer y me dijo que me deje de joder con exuberancias de latina pelotuda.\nThe author parodies the romantic idea of soulmates to the extreme in light of Elena's illness, when she offers to give Gabi her face to transplant it onto her own once she is dead, so they can be together forever.\nAccording to Agnieszka Flisek, the parody made by Cabezón Cámara about the idea of romantic love criticizes its aspect as a cultural construct based on the oppression of women. In several passages, Gabi describes Elena using masculine or military terms, such as tigre, Napoleona, and tanque ultraliviano. The author also draws a parallel between the dominance Elena exerts over Gabi, due to the power she has, and the act of penetration, such as when Gabi describes Elena as un misil que atraviesa la atmósfera or when she recalls their first kiss with the phrase Me entró en la boca como le entraba a todo, como si fuera la dueña.\nGabi's own transformation into a subject with political power also highlights the phallogocentric nature of Latin American societies, by claiming that power had made her grow como una pija, a metaphor of sexism in systems that believe only men can fulfill roles in the political sphere. Likewise, the author again compares dominance through power with the active role in a sexual relationship by having Gabi say Me cogí a medio país and describing her power as tremenda envergadura envidia de mucho macho.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRomance de la negra rubia was well received by critics. Author Nora Domínguez, in a review published by Argentine newspaper Clarín, referred positively to the novella, which she described as [una] apuesta barroca, fundamentalmente irónica, and highlighted its exploration of political power and social resistance. On the other hand, the review by magazine Otra Parte praised the author's style, especially the moments of fuerte tempo poético and its tono de locuacidad barriobajera. Walter Lezcano, from newspaper Página 12, also praised this aspect, referring to the author's narration style as lúdica, humorística y despiadada, highlighting the mixture of colloquial and academic language, apart from the constant use of irony.\nProfessor Natalia Brizuela was equally praising of the novella, referring to it as [una] perla irregular, opaca, con esa inevitable opacidad que va construyendo el pliegue, como en los mejores versos de Góngora. She particularly mentioned the baroque nature of the narrative and the complex transformation of the protagonist, apart from claiming that the work confirmed the idea that Cabezón Cámara's writing es revolucionaria, es emancipadora, es radical.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLe viste la cara a Dios\nGabriela Cabezón Cámara\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Additional bibliography ==\nDomínguez, Nora (2018). \"Entre lo singular y lo colectivo\" (PDF).

        "content": "Erik Larsson Sparre (born Erik Larsson; also known as Erik Gyllensparre, Eric Sparre, or Erik Sparre of Rossvik; 13 July 1550 – 20 March 1600) was a Swedish noble, statesman, diplomat, and political theorist who served as Privy Councilor from 1575 or 1576 until 1590 and Lord High Chancellor of Sweden from 1593 until his execution in 1600.\nAn esteemed orator and rhetorician, Sparre was considered the spokesman for the well-organized aristocratic opposition who advocated for parliamentary sovereignty in the Swedish government and is largely remembered for his contributions to Swedish law. His major written work – Pro lege, rege et grege ('For the Law, the King, and the People') – remains highly regarded as an early defense of contractualism and earned him the reputation as the \"father of Swedish constitutional law\". Sparre's ideas were initially backed by John III of Sweden in order to check the ambitions of his brother, Duke Charles, but relations between Sparre and John soured when the nobility was able to overrule the king's prerogative during a stand-off in Reval.\nSparre's diplomatic career was long and varied. He had early successes negotiating with the Danes in border disputes and helped to secure Sigismund III Vasa's accession to the Polish throne. During the discussions of Sigismund's election, Polish and Swedish tensions heightened after a misunderstanding about the annexation of Estonia, a fault that was blamed on Sparre. Following the death of John III in 1592, Sparre backed Sigismund's attempt to secure the Swedish crown from Charles, but failed to secure significant material gain from potential allies abroad. After Sigismund's defeat, Sparre was convicted of treason during a show trial and beheaded during the Linköping Bloodbath.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nErik Larsson was born on 13 July 1550 to Lars Siggesson of the noble family Sparre and Britta Turesdotter of the noble family Trolle. His father was well-regarded, holding a strong reputation and friendship with king Gustav I, serving as his top general. Records of his youth are scarce and often contradictory, but it is likely that he studied abroad between 1569 and 1573; a 1570 record at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder lists a student as Ericus Sparr, nobilis, Suecus ('Erik Sparre, noble, Swede'). He likely furthered his education in Padua, Italy. During his time abroad, Sparre developed exceptionally strong language skills, particularly in Italian, French, and Latin. At some point in 1574, he returned to Sweden. On 30 November of the same year, he proposed to Ebbe Brahe, daughter of Per Brahe the Elder, who was first cousin to John III of Sweden and a highly influential figure in the Swedish court.\nIn 1575 or 1576, Sparre was appointed Privy Councilor (Swedish: Riksråd) and had a special interest in the organization of the National Archives. Largely uninvolved in the everyday operations of the office, he was used by the court as a functionary and diplomat. He was effectively utilized as commissioner of negotiations with the Danes in March 1575 regarding the Swedish–Danish border before later being dispatched to the courts of the Count of East Frisia and the Holy Roman Emperor in the summer of the same year. Despite these early successes, Sparre was party to several power struggles between the Crown of Sweden, the Duke, and the high nobility, particularly with regards to the distribution of power. In March 1576, Sparre and other members of the nobility submitted new proposals for the liturgy on behalf of the King and the appointment of higher officials to Duke Charles, which he rejected. On 11 February 1577, Sparre, Brahe the Elder, and two other nobles from Uppland met in Stockholm with the clergy and the king, which affirmed the previous liturgical changes, which drew Sparre in the middle of the power struggle between the king and the duke.\nIn 1578, Sparre married Ebbe Brahe at the dowager queen Catherine Stenbock's house on Svartmangatan in Stockholm. John III and his first wife, Catherine Jagellonica, were present as guests for three days, while Catherine Stenbock – along with the Margravine of Baden and the Duchess of Mecklenburg – stayed for four or five days; both the margravine and the duchess were cousins of the king. In August 1580, Sparre served as commissioner for another meeting with the Danes in Knäred and, the following year, he and Hogenskild Bielke traveled to the Duchy of Mecklenburg to negotiate a marriage between the king's sister, Elizabeth, and Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg.\nIn 1582, Sparre was made ståthållare of Västmanland, Bergslagen, and Dalarna. On 1 March of the following year, one of John III's officials, a Scotsman named Andrew Keith, honored Sparre with the title of baron. Despite the honor, Sparre never requested the title nor petitioned the king to have it recognized as legitimate.\nSparre is considered one of the most learned men of his time, particularly in Sweden. He kept correspondence with many well-known scientists and historians of the era, most notably Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, and served as one of Rostock historian David Chytraeus' patrons in Sweden. Sparre's patronage included part of the printing costs of his work, most notably his history of the Nordic countries, Chronicon Saxoniae et vicini orbis arctoi ('The Chronical of Saxony and [Those] Near the Arctic World'), published in 1590.\n\n\n== Pro lege, rege et grege ==\nSparre was a strong advocate for legislative primacy in Sweden, arguing that the Privy Council of Sweden held a special place in society as the \"keystone\" of the legal system. Sparre's most famous work is his pamphlet Pro lege, rege et grege ('For the Law, the King, and the People'). The date of its publication is of some debate; it is generally accepted that Sparre wrote the Pro lege in 1582, though most sources cite its publication in either 1585 or a more vague \"the 1580s\". Some sources estimate the date of publication as late as 1586 or 1587.\nIn the pamphlet, Sparre wrote that the duke was beholden to the laws of the nation and had no sovereign authority; wherever the rights and duties of the Crown interfered, ducal rights were to be subordinated. Sparre further sought to distinguish the office and rights of the king from the office and rights of the Crown, arguing that the possessions of which were not to be minimized in any way, irrespective of any circumstance or sovereign. He argued that the Crown and the king had disparate natures; the king, who is mortal (Swedish: som dödelig är), should not be able to infringe upon the rights and duties of the immutable Crown, which is immortal (som odödelig achtas). Thus, royal titles were issued by the eternal political force of the Crown which could not be tread upon by any mortal king; stately institutions and – most importantly – the nobility were therefore an extension of the immortal Crown. However, dukes served simply as a dominium utile, an extension of the rights and privileges of the king without the same claims to sovereignty, which applied only to \"accidents and conveniences\" (Swedish: tillhörigheter och nyttigheter). Consent of the Estates, particularly the \"leading Estates\", was the cornerstone of the legal process, which bound \"all Swedes, present and absent, those who swear and those who do not swear, those born and unborn\" to rights and duties. Under the law, the king, as a mortal Swede, was himself beholden to it; the supremacy of law applied to all kings irrespective of their hereditary or elected claims of absolutism. The work is lauded as an early appeal to contractualism and orthodox ideas of constitutional doctrine, comparable to the works of Jean Bodin and James Madison. The success of Sparre's rhetoric, which advocated for common welfare and navigated the differing class interests of the era, has earned Sparre the title as \"the father of Swedish constitutional law\".\nSparre stated that he wrote the pamphlet at John III's request and historians believe this was likely true; John III sought to limit Duke Charles' ambition to concentrate power and saw a strong anti-absolutist nobility as a means to that end. For John at the time, it appears that the risk of usurpation by Charles was of more concern than a conglomeration of power in the legislature. The work was also influenced significantly by Sparre's father-in-law, Per Brahe the Elder, who himself had quarrels with Duke Charles and shared the ideas and sympathies of both Sparre and Hogenskild Bielke, especially in being concerned about the loss of privileges by the nobility and holding a sympathetic view of the Catholic Church.\nSparre is commonly associated with Bielke's political thought. Both held the high nobility as key to the future of Swedish law and sought to use their knowledge of history and law to further that end. The primary difference between them is the source of their jurisprudence; Bielke's sourcing and arguments tended to stem from a pragmatic, German-based legal system, while Sparre's tended to appeal to Roman and contemporary Italian law, citing both the Corpus Iuris Civilis and the Liber Extra – among others – in the Pro lege. Together, Bielke and Sparre had drafted a statute on 27 January 1582 in the Riksdag that interpreted the law decisively against Charles, forbidding him from nominating bishops without the king's consent, trying nobles accused of serious crimes, expanding taxes other than agreed upon for the kingdom, restricting the privileges of the nobles, and much more, though its stipulations were largely ignored by Charles.\n\n\n== Mission to Poland ==\nIn April and May 1587, Sparre, Hogenskild Bielke, Erik Stenbock, and Sten Banér were invited to develop a plan of governance in the event John III's son Sigismund III Vasa were elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and inherited the throne of his father, making him king in both realms. In August, Sparre and his brother-in-law Erik Brahe were dispatched to the Commonwealth to act as Sigismund's agents. The discussion continued through the summer, but the agreement – now known as the Statute of Kalmar (Swedish: Kalmare stadgar) – was signed and sealed by John and Sigismund on 5 September. The Statute provided sweeping guarantees to Sweden's independence, secured a prohibition against Polish interference, and unequivocally defined Estonia as \"a Swedish province\" Sparre contributed to it significantly, though John was responsible for the final draft, as Sparre was not actually present in Kalmar when it was signed and sealed.\nDespite the preparation, it was not until January 1588 that it became clear that Sigismund's accession was secure. During the course of negotiations with the Commonwealth, the Poles insisted that lands conquered by the Swedes in Estonia should be handed over to the Commonwealth. Sparre and Brahe were expressly forbidden from accepting any deal that required the surrender of Estonia into Polish hands. A well-regarded orator and rhetorician, Sparre was able to cinch the election of Sigismund without explicitly promising Estonia, but – according to John III – when the pacta conventa was signed, Sparre made verbal promises \"in excess of his instructions\". These promises were later rescinded from the official compact after negotiations between John and Sigismund, the latter declaring at his coronation that Sweden would never be forced to cede any territory to the Commonwealth, though Sparre continued to be blamed for being willing to sacrifice Estonia for the rest of his life.\n\n\n== Conflict in Reval and charges of treason ==\nThe election of Sigismund was fraught with issues, but Sparre and his allies saw a political union with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a way of getting aid to Sweden, which was then at war with Russia. By 1589, Sigismund was looking to abdicate – assuming he could find a suitable candidate to take his place – and John III was losing interest in legal power, seeking to reestablish a familial relationship with his son and return him to Sweden. Nevertheless, both agreed that they could use the union to frighten the Russians into accepting a peace deal; the two hoped that a strong show of military numbers at a meeting in Reval (modern-day Tallinn, Estonia) would cause the Russian leader, Boris Godunov, to accept a permanent peace. Instead, the forces assembled were underwhelming; the nobility had shirked their usual duty in procuring soldiers.\nOn 5 August, eight Privy Councilors – including Sparre – accompanied John to Reval with a small entourage of reluctant Polish senators following three weeks later, with no significant armed force. The Privy Councilors agreed that Sigismund could not be allowed to abdicate and that peace should be attained in the war with Russia at all costs and as soon as possible, fearing that the unhappy Poles might ally themselves with Russia if they were badly treated. When the events in Reval turned out to be a disaster, it remained difficult to dissuade John, who had become obsessed with reestablishing a filial relationship with Sigismund. On 5 September, fifty members of the nobility and eight army commanders signed a petition \"castigating his failings as a ruler in terms of extraordinary harshness\", appealing to him to abandon the plan. When this failed, ten days later the Privy Councilors attempted again to dissuade John, adding in large text in all capital letters to the bottom VINCAT AFFECTUM RATIO (\"May reason triumph over passion\"). Both the Swedish and Polish entourages became enraged as John refused to back out. The Polish entourage exhorted Sigismund to return to Warsaw as an invasion of Podolia was underway by the Tartars and the Privy Councilors of Sweden were threatening to leave Reval as well. On 30 September, Sigismund relented and started towards Warsaw. Two days later, John began his return to Sweden.\nThe events in Reval turned John away from his support of legislative strength and pushed him away from Sparre and his allies; the king had never theretofore capitulated to the nobility. John began seeking out a closer alliance with Duke Charles and – in a desperate attempt to curtail such an alliance – Sparre, Sten Banér, and Ture Bielke all signed an apology, admitting wrong and promising the king that they would not oppose the cession of Estonia if it meant that Sigismund could abdicate the Polish Crown. The attempt, however, was in vain; Charles and John had reached an agreement. In 1590, Sparre, Ture Bielke, Hogenskild Bielke, Gustav Banér, Sten Banér, and Erik Stenbock were displaced from the Privy Council, dismissed from their offices, deprived of their fiefs in the presence of the Estates, and imprisoned. John and Charles charged the members of the Privy Council whom they stripped of their rights and privileges with prolonging the war by sabotaging the events in Reval, fomenting disagreement between John and Charles, and attempting to remove Charles from the succession. Sparre in particular was charged with offering Estonia to the Poles. The evidence for this claim was the Statute of Kalmar, which – since it had not been issued to the Riksdag for approval – was considered to be a secret deal to keep Charles from the throne.\nSigismund repeatedly intervened in defense of Sparre and his allies and even Anne of Poland attempted to clear him of all charges relating to the abandonment of Estonia. John accused Sparre and his father-in-law Per Brahe the Elder of conspiracy and accused Sparre alone of having rallied the men in Reval to oust him. Despite these intercessions, Sparre was imprisoned in Stockholm Castle. While in prison, he complained in letters that he had been unable to attend his father-in-law's funeral, that his brother had been imprisoned, and that he was not a heretic in spite of accusations to the contrary. Still more, Sparre's Scottish baronial title was now the object of suspicion, though Sparre never requested the title nor petitioned the king to recognize it as legitimate under Swedish law and indeed denied wanting it. Regardless, on 6 January 1591, John demanded the baronial certificate and destroyed it, though a copy still survives in the Palmskiöldska Collection.\nSoon thereafter, Sparre was tried in court. While on the stand, he defended himself with an intensity that caused John to draw his sword in anger, but Charles stopped him. No judgement was passed; Sparre and his associates were neither convicted nor acquitted. In February and March 1592, Sparre escaped custody twice.\nOn 17 November 1592, John III died, forgiving all the men who opposed him in Reval on his deathbed in exchange for their promise to remain faithful to Sigismund. Before the end of the month, Charles reached out to Sparre and his colleagues with an offer of reconciliation, but a riot started by Axel Leijonhufvud to convince the locals in Västergötland that Charles was attempting to lead a usurpation of the throne led Charles to accuse Sparre of being behind it. Sparre was able to convince Charles of his innocence in the matter and Leijonhufvud was driven beyond the Danish border.\n\n\n== Accession of Sigismund III ==\nA mutual distrust remained between Sparre and Charles, but Sparre was reinstated as Privy Councilor and appointed Lord High Chancellor of Sweden. On 8 January 1593, they established an interim government whereby Charles was recognized as the \"leading personage\" in Sweden. The rising prominence of the Pro lege became a source of increasing distrust from Charles. When Sparre was late to the Uppsala Synod, arriving in February, it reignited suspicions of heresy, despite his signing of the declaration, which in part banned Catholicism.\nSigismund moved quickly to secure the throne; in February, he dispatched Sparre's brother, Johan, from Poland to secure oaths of allegiance from fortress commanders in Finland. Sigismund himself arrived in Danzig in August, his tardiness blamed on the political situation in Poland as the Polish nobility believed he would use the opportunity to abandon the Polish throne. Sparre and Klas Bielke arrived from Poland the following month, escorting Sigismund to Sweden aboard Klas Fleming's fleet. Sparre and Bielke attempted to convince Sigismund to allow the agreement at the Uppsala Synod to be enforced and to confirm the election of a Protestant, Abraham Angermannus, as Archbishop of Uppsala, making him Primate of Sweden. Sigismund, a devout Catholic, refused.\nPrior to Sigismund's accession, the nobility and Protestant clergy of Sweden made certain demands, called the Postulata nobilium (literally, 'petitions of the nobility'), to which Sigismund ultimately relented. Sparre served as the spokesman for the nobility and gave a lengthy speech – now known as the Oration of the Nobility (Swedish: adelns oration or adels oration) – which cited Hesiod, Salic law, the Bible, and English history, among others in addressing what he had promulgated in his Pro lege, rege et grege. The Oration itself was largely an appeal for the rule of law. During it, Sparre commented:\n\nWhere is the great treasure, which could indeed be reckoned at many millions, which existed when King Gustav died? It is all consumed. Where is now the rich and powerful nobility, the ornament and glory of the kingdom, which aforetime could ride its hundreds to court, to the service and honor of king and country? They too are seen no more: a great part are fallen upon the edge of the sword during so many years against so many and various enemies; some has the aforsaid tyrant [Erik XIV] persecuted and done to death; and they who survive are much impoverished. [...] For us in particular and in general, we ask for nothing more than what Sweden's described law and the old freedom of the country allow. \n\nWhen Sigismund became king, Sparre administered the coronation oath. Sparre was reportedly so tired that his upraised arm became limp during the oath, prompting Charles to forcefully command him to hold it firm until the oath had been fully administered. With Sigismund on the throne, Sparre was reinstated as ståthållare and lawspeaker of Västmanland, Bergslagen, and Dalarna. A period of détente between Sparre and Charles followed; Sparre stood as godfather to Charles' newborn son, Gustavus Adolphus. A short time later, Sparre named his newborn son after Charles.\n\n\n== Preparations for war and defeat in Sweden ==\n\nSigismund's rule in Sweden was extremely unpopular; he was perceived to have walked back several promises, such as installing Catholics in the government – which served to further alienate him from an increasingly Protestant nation – and failing to institute the agreements made in the Postulata. Charles, on the other hand, was becoming increasingly popular and secured guarantees of authority as riksförestådare in Sigismund's absence with the Arboga Resolution. Sparre initially considered an armed revolt to disrupt Charles' rise to power, but quickly determined that this was an untenable option.\nOn 20 March 1597, Sparre and Erik Stenbock fled for Denmark before making their way to Poland, with Sten Banér and Jöran Posse following them in May. By the summer, Sparre had convinced Sigismund that war was inevitable to maintain the crown. In December, Sparre was dispatched to visit the Dukes of Mecklenburg and Pomerania to secure their neutrality in the upcoming conflict before heading to Denmark to persuade Christian IV to invervene on behalf of Sigismund. Although he had supported Sparre when Charles attempted to have him extradited, Christian refused to supply armed assistance, at least partially at the behest of his council who believed Sigismund would easily crush Charles' forces. Further, Christian agreed to allow Polish troops to pass through if it became necessary and offered to serve as a mediator who would appear impartial, but ultimately side with Sigismund.\nAfter a protracted conflict, now known as the War against Sigismund, Charles became the decisive winner at the Battle of Stångebro on 25 September 1598, forcing Sigismund to hand over several of his loyalists, including Ture Bielke, Gustav Banér, Sten Banér, Jöran Posse, and Erik Sparre.\n\n\n== Trial and execution ==\n\nAfter the Battle of Stångebro, Sparre was taken into custody and imprisoned at Nyköping Castle. While imprisoned, Sparre wrote a defense which was later published in Poland. In an undated letter to Nils Gyllenstierna shortly before his death, Sparre complained that no one visited him, wrote to him, or gave him advice or comfort. He lamented that his parliamentary colleagues did nothing to help intercede on his behalf and thus failed him.\nCharles organized a show trial in the nearby town of Linköping with over 150 judges, some of whom were then serving as Privy Councilors. The court was impannelled by Axel Leijonhufvud and Sparre's brother-in-law Erik Brahe, who was a respected Catholic in the country and former ståthallåre. Sparre was charged with treason, attempting to overthrow Protestantism in Sweden, and not recognizing the legitimacy of Charles' position as riksförståndare. Sparre read out a final defense in the hopes of influencing the verdict. When the judgement was read, Sparre tore up his speech in protest and attempted to console his fellow condemned with another speech. Professing his innocence from the scaffold, in the market square of Linköping on 20 March 1600, Sparre was executed by beheading. His body was taken to Peder Stiernfelt's house, where it was wrapped before being interred at the Linköping Cathedral. His body was later exhumed and moved to the church in Öja, where his wife Ebba was also buried after her death.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

Established in 2000, they are owned and operated by Chatham Area Transit (CAT), and run at no cost to the public. The ferries run between 7.00 AM and 10.00 PM, seven days a week.\nThe vessels are named for four noteworthy women from Savannah's history: Juliette Gordon Low, Susie King Taylor, Florence Martus and Mary Musgrove.\nIn both 2019 and 2020, CAT was awarded two grants from the Federal Transit Administration for a new ferries, increasing its total to six.\nIn July 2023, CAT temporarily stopped calling at the Savannah Convention Center dock on Hutchinson Island, instead using the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort and Spa dock.\nBetween 2001 and 2011, passenger boardings increased from 289,000 to 539,000. They operate 362 days a year (not on Christmas Day, Thanksgiving or New Year's), but cannot operate in fog or lightning.\n\n\n== References ==",

Capped twice, Moffett had a starring role on debut against England at Lansdowne Road, kicking two penalties and a difficult conversion in a 11–8 Ireland win, to retain his place for the next match against Scotland at Murrayfield.\nMoffett immigrated to New Zealand in 1963 and captained the Hastings rugby club. He worked as a science teacher at Lindisfarne College, then set up a 500-acre orchard in Hawke's Bay, which grew into a family business.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJonathan Moffett at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Goldene is a 2-dimensional allotrope of gold. The thinnest commercial gold leaf is some 400 times thicker than goldene. It features 9% lattice contraction compared to bulk gold.\n\n\n== History ==\nGoldene was first synthesized as a free-standing material in 2024 by a team at Linköping University in Sweden. A 2022 claim by a team at New York University Abu Dhabi has been disputed as actually containing multiple layers.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\nThe team used a material containing silicene between layers of titanium carbide. Gold layered on top of this combination diffused into the structure and replaced the silicon. Etching away the titanium carbide released free-standing goldene sheets that were up to 100 nanometres wide. The etching was performed using Murukami's reagent, in a 100-year-old technique used to decorate ironwork by Japanese blacksmiths. Surfactant molecules formed a barrier between goldene and the surrounding liquid — to stop the sheets from adhering.\nThe team is exploring the potential for preparing goldene from other non-van der Waals Au-intercalated phases, including developing etching schemes.\n\n\n== Graphene comparison ==\nForming 2D allotropes of metals such as gold has been difficult because metal atoms tend to cluster together and form nanoparticles instead of nanosheets.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe material displayed Au 4f binding energy increase of 0.88 eV. The material is a semiconductor, with the valence band maximum 50 meV below the Fermi level.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nPotential applications included sensing and catalysis.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSingle-layer materials\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Quercus donnaiensis is a critically endangered species of oak trees, endemic to central Vietnam.  This species belongs the Asian sub-genus of Quercus within the family Fagaceae: which have acorns with distinctive cups, characterised by growing rings of scaly protrusions; it was considered a synonym of Quercus langbianensis, but now included by Binh, Ngoc et al. (2018)  in the \"Q. langbianensis complex\".\nIts habitat is broadleaf evergreen montane forest, with the original description locating \"Province du Haut-Donnaï; 1000-1700 m\", so the species name almost certainly relates to the French spelling for the upper Đồng Nai river region rather than the modern province.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe original description states that the tree grows to 25 m and a distinguishing feature of Quercus donnaiensis is the yellow/golden tomentum covering the whole young tree: including young twigs, which later become glabrous and dark brown.\nThe leaves are 100-160 x 40-50 mm, oval-lanceolate in shape, with a few peripheral teeth in upper 1/3; they are densely tomentose at first, becoming hairless, but with a persistent tomentum along midrib. this is nearly flat above, prominent beneath, with 9-14 pairs of secondary veins, at an angle of 60° from midrib; tertiary veins are not visible. The petiole is tomentose and 10-20 mm long.\nFemale catkins  are 25 mm long, with 5-6 flowers on a tomentose rachis; there are typically 4 styles with stigmas that are thick and dark.  The acorns are 15-17 mm long x 12 mm wide, loosely pubescent and rounded at tip.  They are in groups of 4 to 5 on a 70-80 mm rachis and take 2 years to mature.  The cupule is half-round and 15 mm in diameter, with 5-6 concentric scaley rings, enclosing 1/2 of the nut.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Quercus at Wikispecies\n Media related to Quercus at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Selman's Scouts, also called The Rustlers, the Wrestlers and later Selman-Evans gang, was a gang formed by brothers John and younger brother Tom Cat Selman in 1878 in Lincoln County, New Mexico, during the Lincoln County War, when they coalesced with the Murphy-Dolan faction. Sometimes they called themselves simply as Scouts because they claimed they were under the authority of Sheriff George Peppin.\nThey were notorious for their brutality and they robbed stores, rustled cattle and horses, ransacked villages, raped women and murdered men and boys. They were active in Seven Rivers, New Mexico, and it was composed by Texas desperadoes, including Augustus M. \"Gus\" Gildea, Reese Gobles (rumored that his body was found in a drift down the Pecos River), John Gross, Rustling Bob Irwin (he was found dead in the Pecos River, killed by his own party because he was involved in activities outside the gang), Charles Snow, John Nelson, Bill Dwyer, Bob Speakes, V. S. Whitaker, Jake Owens and Marion Turner. Edward \"Little\" Hart, who was also a member, was killed by Selman in a dispute over who should be leader, and by 1880 his brother Tom was apprehended and lynched by the Tin Hat Brigade.\nIn September 1878 the gang went on a three-week rampage through Lincoln County killing, raping, robbing anyone and destroying anything in their path. On 28 September 1878 they demolished Will Hudgen's saloon outside Fort Stanton after threatening and insulting his wife and sister. In Lincoln they ransacked houses, but were repulsed by gunfire when they attempted to take over Issac Ellis' store, and in the south they continued their depravities at José Chavez y Sanchez ranch shooting and killing two of his sons, Clato and Desiderio. They raped two women at Bartlett Ranch, in Rio Bonita they shot and killed three young boys, and they rided the George Coe ranch on the Hondo River, where they mortally wounded Martin Sanchez son.\nIn October 1878 the gang encamped on the Pecos River, they were playing poker game, an argument broke up and John shot and killed the chief on the spot. A larga posse led by Lincoln resident Juan Patron chased the gang and killed several of them in a gun battle in the limit of Fort Sumner.\nIn March 1879 some of the gang members appeared in a most-wanted list made by New Mexico Governor Lew Wallace, including John and Tom Selman, Reese Gobles, Bob Speakes,Gus Gildea, Jake Owens and Rustling Bob Irwin. All were indicted in April for the murders on September 1878, but none came to trial. He left New Mexico and signed up 175 recruits renagades for a large-scale rustling operation in western Texas, but they schemed and began to fall apart and broke the association. John caught Mexican black smallpox,which wasted his body and pitted his face, and almost died.\nWhen he recovered himself he reorganized the gang with Jesse Evans to terrorize between Fort Davis and Fort Stockton, Texas area. He really planed to organize it along John Kinney Gang or The Cowboys. He assumed the name Captain John Tyson and stayed on Fort Davis (he previously assumed the alias of John Goss/Gross and John Gunter/Gunther). They opened a butcher shop to expand their rustling and holdup operations. Local residents, unabled to cope called on Texas Rangers for help and Sergeant L. B. Caruthers recognized him as a fugitive from Shackelford County.\nOn 28 June 1880 he was arrested and imprisioned into the jail at Fort Davis. Jesse Evans and other gang members were later arrested and sentenced in October to the Huntsville Penitentiary after a gun battle in which one gang member and ranger were killed. John was not brought to trial and returned to Shackelford County to answer for his crimes. In August Rangers took him to Comanche County to await court, he was later moved to Albany, but guards, by prearrangment, removed his manacles, gave him a horse and reached Old Mexico.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDeArment, Robert K.

        "content": "Maria Eugênia Simi Villarta Cardoso, best known as Maria Eugênia Villarta (born January 25, 1958), is a businesswoman, plastic artist and former model. She was the model who has made the most magazine covers in Brazil to date, has had her face on approximately 300 of them, in addition to being exclusive to the brand Marcelo Beauty and L'Oréal for many years.\nAn award-winning visual artist, in addition to two honorable mentions, she also received first and second place medals (two silver and one bronze). Her works are part of the artistic collections of the Legislative Assembly of the State of São Paulo, the Municipal Chamber of Santarém, Portugal, and the City Hall of Vinhedo, State of São Paulo.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nMaria Eugênia began her career in 1977, at the age of 18, when she decided on her own initiative to go to an agency to try her hand at modeling. After some photos, a book and some contacts, she was soon called by Editora Abril for her first job, the January 1978 cover of Claudia.\nAlthough she was not tall – 1.63 meters tall – her unusual beauty, along with a harmonious face from any angle, combined with great photogenicity, immediately opened the doors to the world of fashion, making her grace covers and editorials for several magazines, including Nova, Manequim and Vogue, as well as important work as an exclusive model for Marcelo Beauty and for L'Oréal. Called by Hans Donner, she participated in the opening of the eight o'clock soap opera on TV Globo Champagne, which was shown between October 24, 1983, and May 4, 1984, which brought her great national prominence. Her career as a model also took her abroad, having lived for months in New York City, United States.\nRegarded as the model who has made the most magazine covers in Brazil to date, she has had her face printed on approximately 300 magazines. 250 of these photos were exhibited by Taubaté Shopping in 1994, in the exhibition As mil e uma faces de Maria Eugênia (The Maria Eugênia's One Thousand and One Faces) — among the photos, those of the opening of the soap opera Champagne, from TV Globo, various posters, catalogues, advertisements in magazines, editorials and even billboards of makeup campaigns.\nIn 1980, she made a small appearance in the soap opera Água Viva, by Gilberto Braga, playing the character Cristina.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nIn 1992, after fifteen years of career, Maria Eugênia decided leave the fashion and open a painting studio in São Paulo, becoming a recognized plastic artist.\nGraduated in 1978 by the Pan-American School of Art and Design in São Paulo and in 1990 by the Armando Álvares Penteado Foundation, between 1992 and 2002 she exhibited in several national art exhibition halls, in cities such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and São Bernardo do Campo. In 2004, the artist was invited and exhibited in Santarém, Portugal.\nHer works are part of the artistic collections of the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo, the Municipal Chamber of Santarém, Portugal, and the City Hall of Vinhedo, State of São Paulo.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2004, recognized as a Taubatean personality for her artistic contribution to local and Brazilian culture, she was awarded the city's highest honor: the Jacques Félix Commendation. On September 26, 2022, the businesswoman received the title of Cidadã Paulistana from the Municipal Chamber of São Paulo for her services provided to the city.\nThe businesswoman has been married to engineer Jomar Cardoso since 1976, with whom she moved permanently to São Paulo in 1978 and has five children.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The battle of Melilla took place in February 1860, during the Spanish-Moroccan War, when the Spanish garrison of Melilla suffered a fiasco caused by Riffian fighters outside the city.\nOn February 6, the Spanish Melilla garrison was disturbed by the Riffian attacks. The governor of Melilla, Manuel Buceta del Villar, decided to confront the Riffians. The Spanish general, Leopoldo O'Donnell, warned Manuel of any reckless attack, but Manuel disobeyed him. He led a force of 1,200 men to pursue the Moroccans after their defeat at Tétouan.\nManuel believed that the Moroccan forces were low in morale and that the Moroccan commanders wouldn't dare to face him. This proved to be wrong. On the night of February 8–9, he established a camp outside the vicinity of Melilla. The Moroccans, with a large army of 15,000 men, focused on their efforts to attack the Spanish camp. The Spanish were taken by surprise and routed. The Riffians chased the Spanish to the walls of Melilla.\nThe Spanish suffered 370 casualties in this fiasco, while the Riffian casualties were negligible. O'Donnell was furious when he learned of the disastrous sortie and ordered the Spanish navy to bombard several coastal cities to save his face but these did not bring any results. Meanwhile, the news of this victory spread throughout Morocco, and exaggerating the victory did nothing to force Sultan Moulay Muhammad to ask for peace.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJason Lyall (2020), Divided Armies, Inequality and Battlefield Performance in Modern War.[1]\nHenri Mordacq (1908), La guerre au Maroc : enseignements tactiques des deux guerres Franco-marocaine (1844) et Hispano-marocaine (1859–1860) (2e édition).[2]\nFrench Africa Committee and Morocco Committee (1925), French Africa: monthly bulletin of the French Africa Committee and the Morocco Committee.[3]",

        "content": "Xanthosia tasmanica is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and is endemic to southern Australia. It is an erect or ascending perennial herb with trifoliate leaves with elliptic leaflets, and white flowers in a compound umbel with one flower per ray and sometimes another flower between the rays.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthosia tasmanica is an erect or ascending perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 20 cm (7.9 in) and has a few long spreading hairs on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are trifoliate, the leaflets elliptic or wedge-shaped, 4–15 mm (0.16–0.59 in) long and 3–8 mm (0.12–0.31 in) wide on a petiole up to 30 mm (1.2 in) long. The flowers are arranged in a compound umbel with up to 4 rays with one flower per ray and someimes one flower between the rays. There are up to four linear, leaf-like bracts 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long at the base of the flowers and leaf-like green bracteoles 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long at the base of the peduncles. The sepals are green, 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) long and the petals are white, shorter than the sepals, about 1.2 mm (0.047 in) long. Flowering occurs in most months with a peak in spring.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nXanthosia tasmanica was first formally described in 1907 by Karel Domin in Repertorium Specierum Novarum Regni Vegetabilis, from specimens collected between George Town and Circular Head.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of xanthosia grows in coastal heath or forest from the south coast of New South Wales, southern Victoria, the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island of South Australia, the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia and Tasmania.\n\n\n== References ==",
