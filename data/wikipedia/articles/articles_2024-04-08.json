        "content": "\"Alienated\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Zayn. It was released on 12 April 2024 through Mercury and Republic Records as the second single from his upcoming fourth studio album, Room Under the Stairs. Zayn wrote the song by himself and produced it alongside American record producer Dave Cobb.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Zayn, via X, \"'Alienated' was the first song I wrote for the album, so it kind of set the tone for the whole project - it shaped the way I wanted to approach the sound of my own voice, the styling of the guitars and the overall sonic direction.\" He revealed on social media that he wrote the song six years ago. The idea first came up while Zayn was living in Philadelphia when he \"wanted to write something that was a little bit more elevated, and a little bit more insightful than the music that I'd been putting out at that point.\" He also stated that it was his favourite off the album as it \"comes from a place of sheer honesty and vulnerability.\"\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Alienated\" was written by Zayn and produced it with Dave Cobb. The track strays away from Zayn's early R&B sound and focuses on a more soulful sound inspired by artists such as Chris Stapleton and Willie Nelson. Speaking about the sound, he stated \"you can't really put them in a genre,\" as he noted that the song was \"influenced by other music.\" He described it as his version of blues.\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nOn 12 April 2024, Zayn uploaded a live performance video of the song onto his YouTube channel, which marks his first live performance since 2016.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

However, it collapsed on 1 June 1887. It was replaced by a new government consisting of the People's Radical Party and Liberal Party and led by Liberal Jovan Ristić. The new government's first action was to dissolve the National Assembly. A decree on 13 August set the election date as 17 September.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe People's Radical Party won 81 seats and the Liberal Party 61, with the Progressives failing to win a seat. Not all seats were filled and supplementary elections were held later. The king appointed 36 Liberals and 16 Radicals to balance the result.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nTodor Tucaković was appointed president of the National Assembly and Paja Vuković as vice president.\nThe coalition government led by Ristić remained in office until December, when it was replaced by a Radicals-only government headed by Sava Grujić. A decree on 11 January 1888 dissolved the National Assembly and set early elections for March 1888.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Old Rectory is a historic building in Brandsby-cum-Stearsby, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe rectory was originally built in 1565, by Reverend Robert Wilson.  It was a long, low building, with a T-shaped plan, and originally had a thatched roof.  In 1809, Reverend William Smith commissioned an extension, at right-angles to the original building.  The building was sold as a private house in 1938, and it was grade II* listed in 1952.  In 2012, it was marketed for sale for £3.25 million.  At the time, it had six bedrooms, three reception rooms and three bathrooms, plus two two-bedroom cottages, stables, a former coach house housing a swimming pool, and 18 acres of land.The house is built of sandstone.  The original part has a red and blue pantile roof, two storeys, seven bays, and a rear outshut.  It contains double-chamfered mullioned windows with four-centred arched lights and sunken spandrels.  The later range, containing the main front, has a hipped Westmorland slate roof, two storeys and five bays.  It is on a plinth, and has a floor band, a cornice and a parapet.  In the centre is a portico with Tuscan half-columns and a pediment, and a doorway with a traceried fanlight.  The windows are sashes with cantilevered lintels and keystones.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Brandsby-cum-Stearsby\n\n\n== References ==",

The event is scheduled to take place on May 18, 2024, at the OC Theatre in Forney, Texas. It will be the seventh iteration of the Crockett Cup.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Crockett Cup is a tag team tournament first held in April 1986. National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) member Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), headed by Jim Crockett Jr., hosted the Crockett Cup, held in honor of Crockett's father, JCP founder Jim Crockett Sr. and saw participation of teams from various NWA territories. JCP held the tournament again in 1987 and 1988, before JCP was sold to Ted Turner later that year. In July 2017, the Crockett Foundation, with Classic Pro Wrestling, held the \"Crockett Foundation Cup Tag Team Tournament\" in New Kent, Virginia, which was not affiliated with the NWA. Bobby Fulton, The Barbarian, and The Rock 'n' Roll Express, all former Crockett Cup participants, took part in the event as a link to the original tournaments.\nThe original concept of the Crockett Cup was a single elimination tag team tournament, with the storyline prize of $1,000,000.00 given to the winning team along with a large trophy. The 1986 and 1987 tournaments featured 24 teams, while the 1988 version had 22 teams competing. Each tournament was split over two shows to encompass all 23 tournament matches as well as non-tournament matches; in 1986, JCP held a show in the afternoon and another in the evening, while the 1987 and 1988, the tournament was spread out over two days instead.\nOn March 21 2024, it was announced that the Crockett Cup would return and would be held in on May 18, at the OC Theatre in Forney, Texas.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event will feature a number professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as either heels (those that portray the \"bad guys\"), faces (the \"good guy\" characters), or tweeners (characters that are neither clearly a heel or a face) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches as determined by the promotion.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 in professional wrestling\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helosciadium repens commonly known as creeping marshwort, is a species of plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It occurs in Western and Central Europe, being rare throughout its range. It grows in wetland areas where it does not have to compete with taller plants due to grazing by animals, periodic flooding during the winter-spring seasons, or mowing. It is considered a species of near-threatened status at the continental level, critically endangered and legally protected in Poland. It is subject to protection within the European Natura 2000 network.\n\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nThe creeping marshwort is a subatlantic species. It grows in Western Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the British Isles and Denmark in the north, as well as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, and Montenegro in the east. Isolated occurrences outside its core range are found in Turkey, Morocco, and the Canary Islands. As a naturalized species, it has been reported from the Czech Republic, North America, and even from the Swartland region in the Western Cape province of South Africa.\nThroughout its range, the species is rarely encountered, influenced by both its specific ecological requirements and its poor ability to spread over long distances. In the southern part of its range, it grows in mountainous areas (e.g., in Spain and Morocco, at altitudes above 2300 meters above sea level).\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\n=== Habit ===\nThe naked, shiny perennial with creeping stolons typically reaches 10–20 cm in terrestrial habitats, sometimes up to 50–60 cm, and when growing in water, even up to 1–1.5 m in length. In the nodes, the stolons root and develop leaves, which are sometimes absent in the node from which the flower stalk emerges. There are no erect and leafy stems. The roots are filamentous. The stem is light green, smooth, and naked.\n\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThey grow from the nodes of the stolons, reaching up to 10 cm, sometimes up to 20 cm in length (in plants submerged in water, even up to 40 cm), but most often only up to 5 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. The leaf sheaths are inconspicuous. The leaf blades are attached to long petioles and are individually, odd-pinnately compound. The leaflets, numbering 3–6 pairs, are sessile, ovate to rounded, with unevenly and coarsely toothed margins. They reach up to 1 cm in length. One of the notches between the teeth, especially on the third pair of leaflets from the bottom, is distinctly deeper, which is a significant diagnostic feature distinguishing this species from terrestrial forms of fool's watercress. The leaves are usually yellowish-green, lighter underneath, and naked.\n\n\n=== Flowers ===\nGathered in umbellules arising from the node of the creeping stem, the umbels, along with their peduncles, reach a height of 1–3.5 cm, maximum up to 10, sometimes 15 cm. The umbel consists of 2–7 umbellules, each supported by numerous, white-bordered, elliptic, and three-veined bracteoles. The pedicels of the umbellules are usually longer than the pedicels of the flowers, although they may be strongly shortened on heavily grazed pastures. At the base of the umbel peduncle, there are usually 3 to 7 quickly shedding, lanceolate bracts. The flowers are small, with white (sometimes cream or pinkish) corolla petals reaching about 0.5 mm in length, mostly with a pointed and inwardly bent tip. Sepals are absent. There are 5 stamens with white filaments and pale yellow anthers. The pistils are two, bent in two directions. The stigma is small and capitate. The pistils are seated on a stylopodium reaching half their length.\n\n\n=== Fruits ===\nThe spherical schizocarps have a length of 1–1.3 mm and a width of 1.1–1.4 mm (the schizocarp is slightly wider than it is long), with persistent styles bent at the apex. The size of the fruits is influenced by the plant's growth conditions – they are larger under optimal conditions. Individual schizocarps are bluntly 5-angled in cross-section with weakly marked ribs. The fruit mass is 0.27 ± 0.04 mg.\n\n\n=== Similar species ===\nThe creeping marshwort can be confused with common young specimens of the lesser water-parsnip (Berula erecta) and the great water-parsnip (Sium latifolium), which grow in similar habitats. However, the flowering stems of these species are erect and leafy, with the inflorescences almost sessile (in contrast, the stems of creeping marshwort are always prostrate, and the inflorescences are elevated on stalks several centimeters long). Very similar is the fool's watercress (Helosciadium nodiflorum), which, however, has a maximum of two bracts and shorter stalks of umbels compared to the stalks of umbellules. This species, in its terrestrial form, can coexist with creeping marshwort in meadows and can be almost indistinguishable to such an extent that genetic research is necessary to determine the taxonomic affiliation of the plants. Another similar species, Helosciadium inundatum, lacks bracts altogether, and its leaflets have wedge-shaped bases, not rounded as in creeping marshworts.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Biology ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe creeping marshwort can be classified as a hemicryptophyte, helophyte, or hydrophyte depending on the habitat conditions. Among plants with a molecular cloning type, creeping marshwort is included in the Fragaria vesca group characterized by the predominance of spreading through stolons with relatively short individual ramet lifespans. Flowering occurs from June to October, with self-pollination playing a significant role. Fruits ripen from August to October.\nIn Central Europe, it is assumed that the species primarily reproduces vegetatively through stolons. On the other hand, studies on seed germination ecology suggest that, contrary to previous beliefs, at least in northern Germany, there are no significant problems or limitations for the species to spread via seeds. A complicating factor for generative reproduction may be excessive turf density and the lack of initial microsites free from vegetation.\nThe seeds have the ability to float in water for at least 50 days without losing their germination capacity, which is significant for their dispersal (hydrochory). They can be carried by water over long distances (in lake basins or along streams), but they can also be moved on a smaller scale within grassland communities during periodic floods, for example, after heavy rains. Outside of water, the fruits are transported by wind and animals, both attached to fur and hooves (epizoochory) and consumed (endozoochory).\nSeeds partially germinate in the same season they mature, even those floating in water. The seeds form a persistent soil seed bank, retaining the ability to germinate when buried in the soil (even up to 70 years). The density of seeds on species' habitats is recorded at about a thousand seeds per square meter. Seed germination occurs under a wide range of abiotic conditions. In terms of temperature, germination is limited only by high temperatures, which rarely occur in habitats wet and humid enough for the species. It thrives in variable temperatures, although it is not necessary. Good light conditions are necessary for germination. Seeds germinate well on moist substrate, even when flooded for two weeks, which usually limits competition from other species (in places where water stagnates, seeds of most species enter a dormant phase).\nCreeping marshwort populations exhibit large fluctuations in the number of individuals depending on prevailing water conditions or other interactions, such as grazing. In locations on pastures, plants may seemingly disappear during periods of intense cattle grazing, only to quickly recolonize gaps in the sward during breaks in grazing. Naked patches of soil exposed by the trampling of wet soil by cows' hooves are significant for maintaining creeping marshwort on pastures. Due to the length of the stolons, these plants utilize gaps in the sward up to 10–15 cm away from them. For creeping marshwort to persist on pastures, grazing frequency is important – too infrequent grazing results in strong development of vegetation competing with this species and, consequently, its decline.\n\n\n=== Genetics ===\nThe chromosome number is 2n=22. A low genetic diversity within populations was observed, particularly in the lowland (northern) part of Germany, while in the southern part of the country (Bavaria), the differentiation between populations was slightly higher.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\nCreeping marshwort is a light-demanding pioneer species on wet, nitrogen-rich soil. It occurs along water edges, especially lakeshores, in communities of low vegetation flooded outside the growing season, and in gaps in reed beds. Another primary habitat is small depressions in the terrain, flooded in the spring and later drying out, in the Netherlands also interdune depressions on the seaside. In places flooded in winter and spring, the bare soil surface is exposed after the water level drops, enabling the development of light-demanding creeping marshwort. Grazing by animals also favors its growth by chewing up competitive vegetation. Secondary habitats are pastures, usually extensive (over 50 ha), where cattle are extensively grazed, sometimes also horses, as well as places trampled on the edges of waters, e.g., on beaches and boat launching sites, and within recreational areas, including those landscaped as lawns. However, excessive trampling and grazing by animals can eliminate this species.\nThese plants inhabit fertile, moderately fertile, and poor soils, rich in nitrogen compounds, neutral to slightly acidic or slightly alkaline. The mechanical and chemical composition of soils varies at different sites. A constant feature of habitats is the near-neutral soil pH and high humidity (although often with a significant drop in water level by the end of summer). The species' habitats are periodically flooded or inundated with water for a longer period. In particular, places flooded in winter are preferred. While these plants tolerate winter flooding well, prolonged submergence in the summer can lead to plant death (plants die when flooded for more than 56 days or repeatedly inundated for shorter periods). These plants can tolerate shorter and less frequent floods, losing their roots and floating on the water surface. However, creeping marshwort growing in water does not flower. Submergence of the species' habitats in the summer stimulates seed germination. However, these plants wither when watered with saltwater, although sometimes they grow on slightly saline coastal alluvia.\nDue to the pioneer character of the species, a constant feature of its occupied sites is the high frequency and intensity of interactions leading to the limited development of competitive vegetation. The habitat characteristics conditioning the development of creeping marshwort include low vegetation height (optimally not exceeding 20 cm) or at least the presence of gaps (e.g., in reed beds), lack of shading caused by trees and shrubs, and absence of competitive expansive species (strongly growing ones).\nThe plants tolerate frosts down to -20°C.\n\n\n=== Phytosociology and interspecies interactions ===\n\nCreeping marshwort grows in Central Europe in communities of floodplain meadows from the Lolio-Potentillion anserinae association (Agropyro-Rumicion crispi), usually species-poor, as well as in richer communities of Triglochino-Agrostietum stoloniferae and Ranunculo-Alopecuretum geniculati. The most common accompanying species of creeping marshwort (growing with them on over 50% of sites in northern Germany) include: creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), silverweed (Potentilla anserina), water mint (Mentha aquatica), jointleaf rush (Juncus articulatus), hairy sedge (Carex hirta), white clover (Trifolium repens), common marsh bedstraw (Galium palustre), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis).\nIn the British Isles, creeping marshwort is recorded in grass communities dominated by creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) and water foxtail (Alopecurus geniculatus) and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), as well as in trampled grasslands of annual meadow grass (Poa annua) and broadleaf plantain (Plantago major). Alongside dominants in these communities, the most common species include: water mint (Mentha aquatica), common marsh bedstraw (Galium palustre), true forget-me-not (Myosotis scorpioides), great yellow-cress (Rorippa palustris), and marsh speedwell (Veronica scutellata).\nIn France, the species is indicated as associated with the association of Hydrocotylo vulgaris-Baldellion ranunculoidis communities, with vegetation typical of the shores of oligotrophic reservoirs. On the Iberian Peninsula, creeping marshwort grows on the banks of mountain streams accompanied by Glyceria declinata.\nGrazing of creeping marshwort by herbivorous animals (e.g., cattle in pastures) may affect the condition of plants, hinder their development, including fruit formation, but it benefits the population and ensures its sustainability by limiting the development of competitive vegetation and creating microhabitats optimal for this species. This, in turn, enables the spread of creeping marshwort in pastures independently of microhabitats shaped solely by the influence of water conditions – without grazing, creeping marshwort retreats, and its distribution is limited only to local depressions.\nCreeping marshwort leaves are readily consumed by snails and ducks. In Morocco, they are fed upon by Barbary macaques. Plants are also sometimes seriously attacked by aphids feeding on both leaves, root necks and roots. In Polish sites, no feeding on plants by invertebrates or signs of disease affecting the population have been observed.\n\n\n== Systematics and variability ==\nThe species represents the genus Helosciadium, which includes all European species formerly classified in the genus Apium except for its type species –  celeriac (Apium graveolens). Traditionally, the genus Helosciadium was classified as a section within Apium for much of the 20th century, resulting in widespread use of the scientific name attributing it to this genus in the literature. However, the separate genus Helosciadium is well supported by molecular, morphological, and chemical analyses. This genus belongs to the tribe Oenantheae, closely related to Berula and Sium, while the Apium genus represents another tribe – Apieae.\nWithin the genus, the species is most closely related to fool's watercress (Helosciadium nodiflorum), with which it forms a sister group relative to three species: Helosciadium inundatum, Helosciadium crassipes, and Helosciadium bermejoi.\nUnder the name Apium × longipedunculatum, a hybrid with fool's watercress (Helosciadium nodiflorum) has been described, confirmed in genetic studies. This hybrid differs from Helosciadium nodiflorum in having a creeping and more strongly rooting stem at the nodes. In some locations where parent specimens grew together, only this hybrid remained after creeping marshwort disappeared. Earlier, based solely on morphological observations, such a hybrid was also described (as Apium × riddelsdellii Druce), but the diagnosis from 1917 is considered doubtful (at the site, a morphologically very similar intergeneric hybrid between Helosciadium nodiflorum and lesser water-parsnip (Berula erecta) – × Beruladium – was also observed contemporarily, in addition to similar parent taxa).\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe species was first scientifically described as Sium repens by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in his work Flora Austriaca, published in 1775. Subsequently, Mariano Lagasca y Segura described the species as a representative of the Apium genus under the name Apium repens (Jacq.) Lag. (1821), and three years later, it was classified by Johann F.W. Koch as Helosciadium repens (Jacq.) W.D.J. Koch (1824), a classification currently considered appropriate from a systematic standpoint. However, in 1867, Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach again placed species from the genus Helosciadium within the genus Apium, and this generic name was subsequently established in the literature of the second half of the 19th century and the entire 20th century.\nThe name Helosciadium is derived from the combination of the Greek words hélos and skiás, meaning \"swamp\" and \"canopy\" respectively, inspired by the habitat occupied by these plants and the type of inflorescence. The specific epithet repens comes from the Latin word repo, meaning \"creeping\" or \"trailing\".\n\n\n=== Synonyms ===\nThe species has been described under the following names currently recognized as synonyms:\n\nApium repens (Jacq.) Lag.\nApium nodiflorum subsp. repens (Jacq.) Thell. in Hegi\nHelodium repens (Jacq.) Dumort.\nHelosciadium palatinum F.W.Schultz ex Nyman\nLaoberdes repens (Jacq.) Raf.\nSium repens Jacq.\n\n\n== Threats and protection ==\nThe species has not been globally assessed for its endangerment status, but almost its entire geographical range is within Europe, where it has been considered near threatened (NT) at the continent scale. It is protected by the Berne Convention and the Habitats Directive. It is a subject of protection in 167 Natura 2000 sites in the European Union. In all countries where the species occurs, it is listed on red lists of threatened species. Among the threatened species of European plants, it ranks third in terms of distribution (measured by the number of countries where it grows).\nThis plant has been under strict protection in Poland since 2001. Since 2004, it has been under species protection with the reservation that the species requires active protection, and since 2012, legal protection also applies to activities related to conducting rational agricultural, forestry, or fishing management.\nThe main reasons for the decline of the species at its habitats include the cessation of meadow and pasture use, which leads to the development of tall, competitive meadow vegetation that displaces this heliophilous, low species. Another significant problem is the drainage of such habitats, especially eliminating winter water stagnation. Excessive grazing can also lead to the disappearance of the creeping marshwort. Destruction of lake shores due to tourism and recreation and displacement due to natural ecological succession by meadow, marsh, or forest vegetation are also considered threats. In the British Isles, populations of this species may be threatened by invasions of the alien species Crassula helmsii, and in Central Europe, locally, sweet flag (Acorus calamus) poses a problem. In Western Europe, potential threats also include hybridization of the species with fool's watercress (Helosciadium nodiflorum).\nFrom climate change models, it follows that a significant area of the current range will be reduced due to forecasted climate changes in the coming decades (global warming). Outside the climatic optimum of the species, extensive areas will be found in southern Europe, but also in lowlands from France through Germany to Poland. Favorable conditions for the species will arise in higher mountain areas (mainly the Alps and the Carpathians) and in areas under the influence of an oceanic climate in Northern Europe (the central part of Great Britain, the Jutland Peninsula, the central part of the Scandinavian Peninsula). In Poland, the conditions for the occurrence of the species will worsen in lakeland areas but will be maintained or improved in mountainous and upland areas and on the coast.\nConservation actions include, among others, creating gaps in dense vegetation patches within the species' habitats, facilitating the germination of its seeds (germination is stimulated by access to light and can occur at different times of the year except winter). Due to the long viability of creeping marshwort's seeds in the soil seed bank, it is possible to restore this species to its habitats if habitat conditions improve (the species has been successfully restored to some sites in Great Britain in this way). Key to the species' conservation is maintaining floods in the winter-spring period and extensive grazing. Effective in creating surrogate sites and reintroductions is introducing seedlings to new locations with suitable habitat conditions.\nProtective measures involving the collection of plants from nature, their multiplication, and reinforcement of threatened populations, as well as the restoration of vanished sites, have also been successfully carried out in Poland in Gniezno and in the Przemęt Landscape Park.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Edible plant ===\nDue to the traditional, albeit erroneous, inclusion of this species in the Apium genus, this species (and others in the Helosciadium genus) have likely been attributed with similar nutritional and medicinal properties as celery root, which is a popular vegetable. On the other hand, determining the true relationship and systematic position of this species may not change much in assessing its edibility (lesser water-parsnip (Berula erecta) from the closest related genus to Helosciadium, is also edible). The leaves of creeping marshwort have a pleasant, mild taste reminiscent of parsley.\nThe long-standing recognition of creeping marshwort as a species closely related to celeriac has led to initiatives aimed at protecting this species as a genetic reserve for celery.\n\n\n=== Ornamental plant ===\nDue to its prostrate growth habit and its ability to form dense mats in favorable conditions, the plant is used as ground cover in sunny areas along pond banks.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\n\n=== Propagation ===\nPlants of this species can be propagated by division and from seeds. Vegetatively, they can easily be multiplied by dividing the stolons. In an experiment, stolons cut into pieces (each including at least one node) rooted and produced new shoots on average in 86%.\nIn the case of cultivation aimed at increasing the species' resources in nature, especially for creating new replacement habitats, it is recommended to propagate plants from seeds obtained from different populations. This allows increasing the genetic diversity of populations at the established habitats. Stratification is recommended, involving storing the seeds in darkness and cool temperatures for two months (e.g., on moist substrate at 4°C). The seeds are then sown on standard horticultural substrate and kept in a moist greenhouse. For obtaining as many seedlings as possible, vegetative division of the obtained plants is recommended. After planting at the target habitats, particularly in areas grazed by animals, it is advisable to fence the newly planted plants in the initial period to allow them to establish well (shortly after transplantation, they are easily pulled out of the ground by foraging animals). It is also optimal to remove competitive plants by planting the creeping marshwort in strips of bare soil. The best results are achieved by planting during humid weather, preferably at the beginning of autumn. In case of drought, significant losses may occur among freshly planted plants. Since losses are usually expected in the first year of cultivation, to obtain a sustainable population, it is recommended to use as much plant material as possible when creating replacement habitats.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nTo maintain the species, it is necessary to limit competitive vegetation through grazing or mowing and to maintain disturbances in the vegetation at the species' occurrence site (e.g., trampling by animals, flooding, and water stagnation during the winter-spring period).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSzafer, Władysław (1960).

        "content": "Entoloma conferendum is a species of agaric (gilled mushroom) in the family Entolomataceae. In the UK it has been given the recommended English name of Star Pinkgill, based on its distinctive basidiospores. The species is widespread throughout Europe, occurring mainly in agriculturally unimproved grassland, and has also been reported from North America.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was first described by German mycologist Max Britzelmayr in 1881 as Agaricus conferendus. Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred it to the genus Nolanea in 1887 and, when Nolanea was synonymized with Entoloma, Dutch mycologist Machiel Noordeloos transferred it to the latter genus in 1980. For many years the species was known as Nolanea staurospora, now considered a later synonym. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nBasidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 80 mm (3 in) tall, the cap conical becoming convex with age, up to 60 mm (2.5 in) across. The cap surface is smooth, striate at margins when moist, grey-brown to ochraceous brown. The lamellae (gills) are white becoming pink from the spores. The stipe (stem) is smooth, slender, and conspicuously silvery striate, the striations often slightly twisted, lacking a ring. The spore print is pink, the spores (under a microscope) multi-angled and stellate, inamyloid, measuring about 7.5 to 13 μm across.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe Star Pinkgill is common and widespread in Europe. Like many other European pinkgills, it typically occurs in old, agriculturally unimproved, short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns), but may sometimes occur in woodland and bogs. The species has also been reported from North America. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On the Titanic, the navigation bridge (or command bridge) is a superstructure where the ship's command is exercised. From this location, the officer on watch determines the ship's geographical position, gives all orders regarding navigation and speed, and receives information about everything happening on board.\nThe bridge is composed of various compartments: a navigation shelter where watch is kept, and the wheelhouse where a wheel is located, known as the helm in maritime language, which steers the rudder and transmits orders to the engines, also called a chadburn. On either side to starboard and port of the navigation shelter, two exterior wings allow for maneuvers. There is also a chart room and the captain's watch room. The bridge is also connected to officers' cabins, which vary in comfort according to rank. It is also close to the wireless telegraphy room. Six officers take turns on watch duty on the bridge, accompanied by quartermasters and other members of the deck crew. The second officer and the captain may also be present if the situation demands it.\nOn April 14, 1912, around 11:40 p.m., decisions to attempt to avoid the iceberg were made from the bridge. After the collision, the order to evacuate the ship was also decided on the bridge. Crushed by the fall of the first funnel, then by that of the foremast, little remains of the bridge when the wreckage of the Titanic is discovered in 1985.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe bridge is the \"brain\" of the liner and is located in the most appropriate place, in line with the ship's direction of travel, i.e. forward of the boat deck. Situated sixty metres from the bow, the navigation bridge rises some twenty-three metres above the waterline. This gives officers a clear view of the front of the ship and the horizon.\nThe bridge is accessible from the boat deck on the port and starboard sides. Staircases located forward allow access from either side of promenade deck A. It also communicates with the officers' wardroom, located aft of the wheelhouse, at the level of the first chimney. However, access is reserved for the officers in charge of navigation and the crew members on watch at sea.\n\n\n== Infrastructures ==\n\n\n=== Gangway shelter ===\n\nAt the forward end of the boat deck, there is a shelter and two manoeuvring fins. A railing connects them, lining the front of the deck. The bridge shelter is airy and open on both sides to the officers' promenade. Nine windows give the helmsman and navigation officers an unobstructed view of the foremast and bow.\n\n\n==== Auxiliary helm and course compass ====\nUnder the bridge shelter is an auxiliary steering wheel from the Titanic's rudder. It is used at harbour entrances and exits, so that the helmsman, working in open space, can more easily hear the successive orders of the manoeuvring officers. The auxiliary helm is also used along the coast, in good weather or hot conditions. It is mechanically connected to the main rudder.\nA course compass, manufactured in Glasgow, is located opposite the auxiliary helm, so that the helmsman can see it at all times. The instrument consists of a wooden base (cockpit) topped by a magnetic compass, fitted with an internal oil light. It indicates the ship's course. In addition, a rudder angle indicator (axiometer) is fixed to the ceiling of the bridge shelter. This electrical indicator tells the helmsman the precise angular position of the rudder in relation to the ship's axis. The third officer, Herbert Pitman, was in charge of checking the compass, correcting the compass course with the help of the deviation curve. The officer relied on the bearing compass, located on a platform on the boat deck, between the second and third funnels, in the centre of the liner. Navigation can be astronomical, using the stars and the sun. An identical compass and the main helm are located in the wheelhouse.\n\n\n==== Order transmitters ====\nThe bridge shelter contains five telegraphs. These transmit orders to various installations on the liner. Two of them are connected to the engine room, two others to the gangway. The last is an emergency telegraph, which also communicates with the engine room. It is only used if the other two fail.\nThe telegraphs connected to Titanic's engine room are used by the officer of the watch or the commanding officer to communicate any orders concerning forward and astern speed.\nForward, the possible orders are, in ascending order of power, Dead Slow, Slow, Half, Full.\nThe \"STOP\" command instructs the engine room to stop propeller rotation.\nThe Stand By command means that the machine must be ready. The Dead Slow, Slow, Half and Full commands indicate different levels of propeller revolutions per minute (i.e. power required).\nTowards the rear, the power commands are identical.\nThe Finished With Engines command indicates that the machines are no longer required.\n\n\n=== Wheelhouse ===\n\n\n==== Operation ====\nThe wheelhouse was an innovation in ship steering at the beginning of the 20th century. On the Titanic, it enabled the helmsman to steer the ship at night, or in cold temperatures. The wheelhouse has five windows arranged so that the view can be extended through the nine windows in the bridge shelter. The helmsman is raised by a small platform to maximise his view of the course compass in front of him and the bow of the ship.\nAt night, the wheelhouse is completely closed, the blinds on the five windows are lowered and the helmsman relies on the course compass and the orders of the officer of the watch. The purpose of this total closure of the wheelhouse is to enable the quartermaster to concentrate on the course compass, not allowing himself to be distracted by any outside light. Similarly, the order transmitters are designed to be lit from inside at night, but this lighting is deactivated when the ship is on the high seas, as orders are less common.\n\n\n==== Telephone system ====\nThe wheelhouse is equipped with a set of four horn telephones. These are used to communicate with four of the ship's installations, to ensure smooth navigation. The forecastle, crow's nest, engine room and docking gangway were all linked to the wheelhouse. On the evening of the collision, the watchman Frederick Fleet used the telephone in the crow's nest to warn the bridge of the presence of the iceberg.\nIn addition to these telephone installations, Titanic was equipped with a switch to close the watertight doors. On the night of the sinking, this switch was operated by First Officer William Murdoch, closing the compartments. There could have been an indicator, but only the testimony of a sailor confirms this.\n\n\n==== Other installations ====\nIn addition to the telephone system, the wheelhouse also includes an underwater signal receiver, capable of warning the ship of the approach of a dangerous area. This system works by means of two boxes, each containing a microphone, placed inside the hull, below the waterline, on the port and starboard sides. Connected to the receiver in the wheelhouse, these boxes receive noises identified by bells of different tones, over a distance of up to 20 miles. This indicator is useful when approaching a dangerous place, but also for navigating in fog, as it allows the liner to be located in relation to the signals picked up.\nTitanic's wheelhouse was also equipped with a speed indicator and a clinometer to measure the ship's angle of heel. Lastly, it was equipped with two pendulums, sextants, marine chronometers, thermometers and barometers.\n\n\n=== Officers' accommodation ===\n\nAt the back of the wheelhouse, at the level of the first funnel and accessible from the boat deck, are arranged the accommodations for the eight navigating officers. The entirety of these accommodations is designated as the \"officers' quarters.\" The captain has the most luxurious apartments, a set of three rooms, a personal bedroom, a lounge, and a bathroom, located on the starboard side. The apartments of the fourth officer and a smoking room are situated on the same side.\nOn the port side, a corridor provides access to the apartments of the second officer, the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth officers. The navigation room is a meeting space for the captain and his officers for all matters concerning navigation. The chart room, located just behind the wheelhouse on the port side, contains numerous map portfolios and nautical documents, as well as the two master clocks. These clocks control the forty-eight clocks distributed throughout the entire ship. These two main clocks (or marine chronometers) require daily evaluations of their running, as they are never reset to protect their delicate mechanism. For example, while sailing towards America, the clocks gain half an hour each day of navigation. Every day at noon, the fourth officer Joseph Boxhall records the time discrepancies in the \"chronometer log.\" The chart room also contains the International Code of Signals, as well as the Titanic's logbooks and navigation charts. The harbor pilot's cabin adjoins the chart room on the starboard side. It is used during port entries and exits. When the pilot boards the liner, they go to this cabin with the captain to advise on the maneuvers to be carried out.\nFinally, the officers have at their disposal a bathroom located opposite radio room.\n\n\n=== Radio room ===\n\nThe radio room, whose radio operators are Jack Phillips (chief operator) and Harold Bride (assistant operator), is located about 12 m from the forward end of the boat deck, behind the first chimney. It communicates with the bridge via a passageway to port of the officers' quarters. It consists of three rooms.\nThe room furthest to port is known as the \"salle sourde\", which contains the radio transmission equipment and an emergency transmitter. From the roof of the \"salle sourde\" emerges the 50 m high vertical radiating radio wire linking four horizontal wires to form the T-shaped antenna. This is where the radio receiver and control equipment are located. Finally, the room furthest to starboard is a rest room, equipped with a bunk. During the voyage, the two radiotelegraph operators took it in turns to ensure a permanent listening watch by wireless telegraphy on the 600 metre wavelength from the Titanic. At night, Jack Phillips, the chief operator, was on watch from 8pm to 2am, while his colleague Harold Bride was on watch from 2am to 8am. During the day, the men took turns for mutual convenience, but in such a way as to ensure a continuous watch. The operators shared the toilets and showers with the navigation officers. They also had a small lounge on C deck.\n\n\n=== Radiotelegraphic correspondence ===\nNormally since 1903 for the exchange of radiotelegraphic correspondence with ships at sea: ships such as the Titanic transmitted on a wavelength of 300 metres (1,000 kHz) and listened on a wavelength of 600 metres (500 kHz). (Coast stations normally transmitted on a wavelength of 600 metres and listened on a wavelength of 300 metres). Ships and coast stations were able to transmit and receive on the same wavelength; for example a ship contacting another ship on the 600 metre wavelength or a ship broadcasting weather information or iceberg positions on the 600 metre wavelength.\n\n\n=== Docking gangway ===\nOverlooking the third-class promenade deck, the Titanic's stern bridge is a facility for manoeuvring the ship to dock or handling it in confined spaces. It is arranged transversely to the stern deck and, unlike the main bridge, is not sheltered. It has several facilities, similar to the wheelhouse.\nIt is equipped with two telegraphs linked directly to two of the order transmitters on the navigation bridge, so that they operate in pairs. One pair is used to communicate orders to the engine room, while the other transmits manoeuvring and steering orders. It also includes Titanic's third steering wheel (along with the one under the bridge shelter and the one in the wheelhouse), used in the event of failure of the main wheel's remote control motor. Finally, the stern bridge has a course compass.\nThe petty officers were responsible for taking it in turns. On 14 April 1912, George Rowe was on watch. He spent the evening walking and talking to the passengers to keep active and warm, when at around 11.40pm he was surprised to see an iceberg pass alongside the ship. Remaining at his post, it was only three-quarters of an hour later that he was informed of the situation, when he telephoned fourth officer Joseph Boxhall to tell him that he had just seen a canoe leave. He then returned to the ship's bridge where he helped fire distress rockets until 1:25 am. Then, at 1:40 am, he was put in charge of folding raft C, and survived the sinking.\n\n\n== Command of the ship on its only crossing ==\n\nThe crew assigned to command the ship consisted of eight navigation officers. Captain Edward John Smith, in command of Titanic, and his second-in-command Henry Wilde supervised a team of six navigation officers, who were responsible for navigating the ship according to their watch.\nThe captain reported directly to three \"senior\" officers, who were responsible for the navigation of Titanic according to their watch. The three most senior officers designated for these tasks were the Executive Officer, Henry Wilde, First Officer William McMaster Murdoch and Second Officer Charles Lightoller. William Murdoch was to have been Titanic's second in command, but at the last minute Henry Wilde was imposed, demoting Murdoch to first officer and Charles Lightoller to second officer. All three men had already sailed on the Titanic's sister-ship, the Olympic; this last-minute change had the advantage of assigning to the Titanic three sailors already experienced in manoeuvring such a ship. David Blair, originally second officer, left the liner.\nThese three men took turns every four hours 13, and had under their command two 'junior' officers, who worked in pairs. Depending on the watch, the two junior officers supervised by a senior officer are Herbert Pitman, third officer and Harold Lowe, fifth officer; or Joseph Boxhall, fourth officer  and James Paul Moody, sixth officer.\nThe officers were also responsible for reporting important events in the bridge diary, located in a small room at the back of the wheelhouse, the chart room. Wilde was generally in charge of this task Titanic's helm was entrusted to one of the seven petty officers of the deck crew, who reported to a senior officer.\n\n\n== The night of the sinking ==\n\n\n=== Collision ===\n\nOn the evening of 14 April 1912, at 11.40pm, while the Titanic was travelling at 22.5 knots, an iceberg was spotted by the crow's nest watchmen Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee. The senior officer of the watch was William McMaster Murdoch; the junior officers were Joseph Boxhall and James Paul Moody. Frederick Fleet immediately rang the crow's nest bell three times, then telephoned the wheelhouse. The sixth officer, Moody, took the call: Fleet alerted him to the presence of an iceberg less than 500 metres in front of the ship.\nMoody immediately informed First Officer Murdoch, who ordered the helmsman in the wheelhouse to turn to starboard: \"Hard a'starboard \". With this order, Murdoch tried to turn the ship to port. Using the order transmitters, he also ordered the engine room to go astern: \"Full astern\". However, after the sinking, the chief engineer stated that the order transmitter was indicating \"STOP\". The Titanic finally hit the ice. The Titanic finally hit the iceberg, which blew the rivets of the hull below the waterline over five compartments, opening up an ingress of water. Using the control in the wheelhouse, Murdoch closed the ship's watertight doors. Shortly afterwards, the captain, who was in his quarters, was woken up by the shock and asked First Officer Murdoch for a report. He also asked for the engines to be completely shut down and for Fourth Officer Boxhall to assess the damage. However, Boxhall did not notice anything unusual. The captain then ordered a survey of the ship by the Titanic's architect, Thomas Andrews. Andrews drew up a prognosis after going down with the captain and his first officer Henry Wilde to the lower decks to see the damage. The captain asked Fourth Officer Boxhall to warn Officers Lightoller and Pitman, who had remained in their quarters. All the officers gathered in the navigation room with Thomas Andrews, who announced that the ship was doomed.\n\n\n=== Assignment of officers to lifeboats ===\n\nOrders were given to lower the lifeboats and to send radio messages from the station near the officers' quarters.\nThe evacuation of the passengers in the lifeboats was organised as follows: First Officer William Murdoch was in charge of all the lifeboats on the starboard side (i.e. all the odd-numbered lifeboats plus the A and C lifeboats) and Second Officer Charles Lightoller was in charge of all the lifeboats on the port side (all the even-numbered lifeboats plus the B and D lifeboats). The other officers had to assist Murdoch and Lightoller in their tasks. At 0:55 am, Third Officer Pitman helped to fill the No 5 lifeboat and then boarded it to take command.\nSecond-in-command Henry Wilde was carefully involved in loading the boats, but Charles Lightoller took control of operations, having had experience of a previous shipwreck. At around 1.30 am, Wilde ordered fifth officer Harold Lowe, who had come to help fill canoes 14 and 16, to board canoe 14. James Paul Moody, the sixth officer, assisted fifth officer Lowe but declined the offer of a place in the boat. The fourth officer, Boxhall, boarded lifeboat No. 2 at around 1:45 am.\nOperators Jack Phillips and Harold Bride sent distress messages until water flooded the radio room shortly after 2:10. Two hours and thirty minutes after the collision with the iceberg, the water reached the bridge shelter and the wheelhouse at around 2:15am.\nCommander Smith and his second-in-command Wilde, as well as officers Murdoch and Moody, disappeared in the wreck; their bodies were never recovered. Charles Lightoller survived by joining folding raft B, a few minutes before the Titanic disappeared beneath the waves. He was in the company of Archibald Gracie. He was the most senior officer to survive the sinking.\nAt around 4.10 am, the first lifeboat was picked up by the RMS Carpathia. It was standard lifeboat no. 2, under the command of Joseph Boxhall. Dinghy no. 12 was the last boat recovered. Charles Lightoller was the last survivor to board.\n\n\n=== State of the installations on the wreck ===\nAfter sinking, the Titanic crashed violently to the bottom of the ocean at a depth of almost 3,700 metres. The bridge shelter and wheelhouse were damaged by the fall of the first funnel, then destroyed as the ship fell to the ocean floor. The foremast collapsed onto the port gangway railing.\nThe crow's nest, shown in the 1986 photographs, has now disappeared, probably having fallen inside the hull. The bronze control formerly attached to the main helm is still present. The officers' quarters and adjacent rooms are in better condition, particularly Commander Smith's cabin. However, the roof of the radio room is pierced in several places, having been used as a landing platform for submersibles. In 2000, an expedition made it possible to refloat the foot of the wheelhouse bar. In 2017, a study published by the BBC revealed that the entire wreck could disappear within twenty years. In 2020, an American survey confirmed that the walls of the navigation bridge, the officers' quarters and the radio room had been completely dissolved.\n\n\n== On the Olympic and the Britannic ==\nTitanic is the second of the three Olympic class ships. In fact, it benefited from improvements over its predecessor, the Olympic, and the lessons learned from the sinking led to a rethink of the gangways on the two surviving sister ships.\nOn board the Olympic, the officers' quarters were organised differently and were smaller. The change in organisation came from Joseph Bruce Ismay's idea of adding a few first-class cabins on the deck of the Titanic's boats. The shape of the wheelhouse also differed from those on Titanic and Britannic. However, it was later modified. A platform for a compass was also placed on top of the wheelhouse following the redesign.\nThe Britannic, which was still under construction when Titanic sank, had its gangway redesigned. The panel for the watertight bulkheads no longer indicates whether they are closed or open, but clearly indicates their position. The order transmitters have also been improved, and a device indicates the precise number of revolutions of the ship's engines. As on the Olympic after her refit, the bridge roof houses a compass. Communication between the bridge and the radio room, which had been lacking on board the Titanic, was improved by means of a pneumatic tube linking the two installations. On the Olympic, this link was made by telephone.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Related articles ===\nTitanic\nSinking of the Titanic\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBrewster, Hugh; Coulter, Laurie (1999).

It is currently unreleased and unnamed.\n\n\n== Speculation ==\nWhile 311’s 14th studio album is currently unnamed, unreleased, and has yet to be announced, it has been confirmed by most band members that recording has finished.\nBassist P-Nut confirmed via X that Scotch Ralston and Colin Brittain will be producing Album #14. This will mark six 311 albums produced by Scotch Ralston. Judging by past albums MOSAIC and Voyager, Album #14 will most likely be another split album, having two producers, as Mosaic and Voyager were split between Scotch Ralston and John Feldmann.\nA new song called “You’re Gonna Get It” was performed as a live debut at 311 Day 2024 in Las Vegas, NV.You’re Gonna Get It will be the first single from the album along with a music video being filmed on April 9, 2024. This was confirmed by lead singer and guitarist Nick Hexum on a Twitch livestream.",

The highest placement obtained by them is the 5th runner-up finalist; won in 2024 by Emma Martini.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2016, after Miss Grand Thailand began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name seventy-seven provincial titleholders to compete in the national pageant, the license for Satun province was purchased by a local entrepreneur, Janrob Rukwijit (เจนรบ รักวิจิตร), who organized the first Miss Grand Satun competition on 12 April of that year, as a sub-event of an annual charity fair \"Mother of the Land Fund\" (กองทุนแม่ของแผ่นดิน), in which Nittiya Daokrajai was announced the winner. \nJenrob lost the competition license in early 2017 after sending the Miss Grand Satun 2017 winner, Punyaporn Ratcharit, to compete at another regional pageant, which violated the rule of the national organizer not to allow all provincial titleholders to participate in other pageants without completing the year of reign. The 2017 provincial contest was then held again by new licensees, Sittichai Wangklin and Siptheeratham Yingyong, to determine the replacement representative.\nThe pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\n\nWinner gallery\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Satun's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Satun representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Satun at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

It was equipped with drone jamming equipment that could jam drones that were operating on different frequencies. It was captured by the Azov Brigade on 5 April 2024 near the Ukrainian village of Terny.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn early 2024, Russian forces launched an armored assault on the Ukrainian village of Terny with the village becoming hevily contested. On the night of 5 April 2024, the  Azov Brigade attacked a Russian tank convoy. The Azov Brigade claimed to have killed 50 Russian soldiers during the ambush. They also showed images of a heavily modified T-72B3 obr.2022 tank they had captured named Tsar. They reported on their telegram that Tsar's drone-jamming had been notably effective and included the ability to counter large numbers of drones with guidance systems operating on different frequencies. They also reported that the Tsar was in drivable conditions and that it's crew had abandoned it. Afterwards members of the Azov Brigade painted a Wolfsangel on the tank and took a picture with it. The captured tank was later repaired and integrated into the Azov Brigade's tank battalion.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was bishop of the New York and Philadelphia Synod in the Reformed Episcopal Church (REC) and also served as presiding bishop of the church.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHerter was born to John and Agnes Herter on June 5, 1913, in Kessab in present-day Syria. John Herter was the director of a German-run orphanage in Kessab. He received his B.A. and his M.A. from Haverford College in 1945 and 1947, respectively; his M.A. thesis was on Anglican and Presbyterian clergymen of Philadelphia during the American Revolution. Herter also obtained an M.Div. from Reformed Episcopal Seminary in 1943 and a Th.M. and Th.D. from Westminster Theological Seminary, where his dissertation was entitled \"The Abrahamic Covenant in the Gospels.\" The dissertation was published under the same title in 1972.\n\n\n== Ordained ministry ==\nHerter was ordained by Bishop Howard David Higgins to the diaconate on February 16, 1943, and to the presbyterate in the Reformed Episcopal Church on November 29, 1944. He began his ordained ministry as rector of St. Matthew's REC in Havertown, where he spent 17 years. He also taught New Testament studies at Reformed Episcopal Seminary starting in 1948, where he spent 36 years, the last 21 as professor of New Testament studies.\nIn 1965, Herter was elected assistant bishop in the REC's New York and Philadelphia Synod and later bishop coadjutor, succeeding Higgins as bishop ordinary in 1972. He was elected presiding bishop of the REC in 1975 and served for four three-year terms. He retired as bishop ordinary in 1984 and stepped down as presiding bishop in May 1987, shortly before his death on June 2.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHerter married the former Ruth Birbeck (1910–2003) on June 14, 1941, and they were married until his death. They had one son, Philip, and two grandchildren.\n\n\n== References ==",

Kgosikwena became regent of the Bakwena for Kgari Sechele III, the underage Bakwena kgosi, in March 1996 upon the death of the previous regent, Moithali Sechele II. Kgari Sechele III became chief on 1 February 2002.\nKgosikwena also served as president of customary court of appeal. He has remained out of public view in his later life. He was accused of stealing a goat in 2009, and he was sentenced to prison in 2010 for stock theft. He was initially sentenced to four years, but it was increased to five on appeal. He was released after a second appeal in 2012.\nKgosikwena was widowed. He remarried on 16 September 2018 to MmaMosweu. He was charged with assault against his wife on 13 January 2023, but he was acquitted later that year after the prosecution failed to appear in court.\nKgosikwena spoke at an event for the Botswana National Front in 2022, of which he is a member.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Robert Elwyn Bradbury (1929–1969) was a British social anthropologist who conducted studies on the art, history, and culture of Benin. He worked with Peter Morton-Williams at the University College, University of London (UCL), contributing to the understanding of the Edo and Yoruba societies of southern Nigeria.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBradbury's research initially focused on the political and ritual organisation within villages, forming the basis of his Ph.D. fieldwork from 1951 to 1952. He later studied the institutions of the Oba from 1952 to 1954, conducting ethnographic surveys of the Benin Kingdom. He was a research fellow under the Benin History and Culture Research Scheme led by Onwuka Dike at the University of Ibadan, working with historians Alan Ryder and art historian Philip Dark.\nDuring his fieldwork, Bradbury lived with Chief Omoruyi, the Ezomo, and later in Benin City near Edo College with his family from 1957 to 1961. His wife, Rosalind, taught biology at the University of Birmingham, and their children, born in Benin City, were given Edo forenames by the Ezomo and the Oba. Bradbury lectured at UCL until 1964 before moving to the University of Birmingham to assist in the development of the Center of West African Studies. He last visited Nigeria in 1967.\nBradbury was proficient in the Edo language and experienced in both rural and urban settings. His published essays focused on the complexity of history and indigenous cultural categories, as well as societal change. Morton-Williams described Bradbury's method as a combination of anthropology and history.\nBradbury's work had an impact on Benin studies, despite the small number of his publications. His field notes at the University of Birmingham are a resource for Benin specialists. Bradbury and Morton-Williams used photographic film advancements in the '50s to document material culture.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nBradbury died on 23 December 1969 at the age of 40. He was known for his expertise on the Edo-speaking communities of Nigeria and his papers on Benin's political organisation, religion, art, and history. The R. E. Bradbury Memorial Fund was established in his honour, awarding annual prizes in Nigeria and Britain for excellence in historical and social sciences.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarbara Blackmun\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "Paschal Salibury, OP (born Donald Hughes Salisbury; 6 June 1928 – 18 August 2023) was an African-American Catholic priest who became the first African-American member of the Dominican Order in the United States.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nDonald Hughes Salisbury was born on 6 June 1928 to Protestant parents in Lawrence, Kansas. He grew up at a time when there were strict segregation laws and very limited employment opportunities for African Americans. Hi grandparents were born into slavery in Missouri and after earning freedom moved to Kansas.\n\n\n=== Military service ===\nIn 1946, he graduated at the Liberty Memorial High School and immediately enlisted himself in the United States Army, which was segregated at the time. While serving in the military, though a Protestant, he enjoyed listening to the The Catholic Hour, a popular weekly radio program hosted by Bishop Fulton Sheen, which gave him an interest in Catholicism and that influenced his whole life. After serving in the Army for his whole tenure, he joined the air force soon after President Harry S. Truman issued the executive order outlawing racial segregation in the armed forces. He was later promoted to staff sergeant while serving at Williams Air Force Base, a jet pilot training facility in Maricopa, Arizona.\n\nDuring Protestant services at the base chapel, Salisbury played the organ. He was keen to get more time to practice the organ, so a friend recommended that he use the late-night hours of the base's Catholic chapel. After getting to know the chaplain, he started to play the organ during mass. With his frequent involvement with Catholic activities, he converted to the faith and was baptized in 1948. His friend, Fr. Joseph Sergott, a fellow Dominican, explained the influences that made Salisbury embrace Catholicism, saying: \"One influence was Father Fulton Sheen, who he listened to on the radio. But his experience playing the organ for Mass went deep within. He became Catholic. He was proud of his Catholic faith and eager to live it.\"\n\n\n=== Religious life ===\nAfter leaving the Air Force, Salisbury moved to California. He studied business at the University of San Francisco and graduated in 1957, becoming second in his class. Salisbury had a good education, but had trouble finding employment. While pursuing his profession, he attended masses regularly and joined the choir at St. Dominic's Catholic Church, where he began discerning priesthood. He made several attempts to join religious communities, but due to discrimination, he was either told to become a lay brother or denied entry.\nSalisbury was finally accepted to the Dominican Order of the Western Province in 1961, taking the name of \"Paschal\". After six years of religious formation, he was ordained a priest on 16 June 1967 by Bishop Floyd Lawrence Begin, becoming the first African-American priest of the Dominican Order in the United States.\nHe was first assigned at St. Dominic's Catholic Church where he was well-received, and afterwards, after completing a clinical pastoral education, worked as a hospital chaplain and hearing confessions in different hospitals in the states of Washington, D.C., New York, Minnesota, Oregon and California.\nIn 2008, Salisbury retired from his hospital chaplaincy and moved to the Holy Rosary Priory in Portland, Oregon. He devoted his last years gardening, celebrating masses and hearing confessions until the point where he found it difficult to climb stairs and a fall left him bedridden and in a wheelchair.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn late July 2023, Salisbury became very ill and was sent to the hospital on August 9, being entered to hospice care for the final weeks of his life. He died on 18 August 2023, at the age of 95.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn Memoriam: Fr. Paschal Salisbury, OP\nDeath of Fr.

        "content": "The Fogheraccia di San Giuseppe (Romagnol: fugaràza 'd San Jusèf, also fugaréna, fugaràcia, or fugaròina), also known as the Focarina, is an annual public bonfire lit on the evening of 18 March, the vigil of Saint Joseph's Day, in the historical region of Romagna, northern Italy, and San Marino.\nThe tradition is believed to be of Roman or Celtic origin. The bonfires, which are accompanied by music and food stands, are especially popular in Rimini, where they extend the length of the city's coastal conurbation from Cattolica to Cesenatico. Inland, the bonfires are sometimes anticipated in the similar tradition of Lòm a Merz (transl. Lights of March), held between late February and early March.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn Rimini, the bonfire is called fugaràza 'd San Jusèf in the Romagnol language; the variant fugaràcia is found further south and fugaròina further north. In the rest of Romagna, the bonfire is called fugaréna. The name derives from the upwind (al fugarèn) with which the bonfires are lit.\n\n\n== Distribution and Lòm a Merz ==\nThe Riminese fugaràza extends the length of the city's coastal conurbation from Cattolica to Cesenatico. Bonfires are also lit across San Marino.\n\nWhile bonfires are also lit on 18 March outside of the coastal settlements, in some inland settlements, they are anticipated in the peasant tradition of Lòm a Merz (transl. Lights of March). Held in the last three days of February and the first three days of March, the festival also features bonfires and traditional music. According to a local superstition, on those six days, collectively konwn as the dé dla Canucéra, a mysterious and ominous influence could wreak havoc at an unknown and unpredictable hour, so that agricultural workers should abstain from work.\nIn some inland settlements, the bonfires intersect with the segavecchia , a mid-Lentern tradition in which an effigy of an old woman, who is stuffed with dried fruit, sugared almonds, or coins, is paraded, torn apart, and buried.\n\n\n== History and customs ==\nThe fogheraccia likely derives from customs for the spring equinox. The event may be linked to the Celtic occupation of Romagna, and share cultural roots with the Celtic festival of Beltane. The bonfires may have been intended to warm the Sun after winter, or they may have been intended as a purification ritual for fire or agriculture. The Lòm a Merz especially coincides with the beginning of the early Roman calendar: the bonfires may have symbolised the start of the new year, and honoured Mars, the Roman god of agriculture, whose month was March, in preparation for the agricultural season.\nLarge bonfires would be erected in each village, while remote houses would construct their own smaller bonfires. In the 1950s, villages would compete to erect the highest and longest-lasting bonfire. In the countryside, the bonfires typically used stubble, pruned olive tree branches, and harvest waste, while in the coastal regions, the fires included wood washed ashore during the autumn and winter, locally known as the almadìra. Old furniture and wood scraps would then be added to the fire. Combustible materials would sometimes be stolen from construction sites and homes. During the lighting of bonfires, fishermen would sing a nursery rhyme relating the fogheraccia to the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March:\n\nFogheraccia, fogheraccia, Saint Joseph is made happy,and the Madonna is raised.\nVillagers would commonly visit other local bonfires after staying some time with their own. Once the fire was extinguished, heifers and adolescent girls walked over the bonfire's smoking embers to encourage them to breastfeed.\nIn contemporary celebrations, the bonfires are accompanied by cultural celebrations, including traditional music and food stands selling piada, doughnuts, and wine. The exact date of the celebration is liable to postponement due to bad weather.\n\n\n== Outside Romagna ==\n\nBonfires are lit for Saint Joseph's Day in several places in Italy outside Romagna, such as in Bobbio, Emilia-Romagna, on which an effigy of an old woman is also burned; in Matera, Basilicata; in the Val Trebbia, where the bonfire is konwn as fuiè ad San Giusèp; and in Serracapriola, Apulia, where the bonfire is known as ù féòn. Zeppole are traditionally fried on the bonfires in Itri, Lazio.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA fogheraccia features in the opening scenes of Federico Fellini's 1973 film Amarcord. Depicting a moment in shared village life, a segavecchia is set alight at the top of the fire, with the words: \"And with this fire, my old lady, the winter and frost takes you away.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nKupala Night – an Eastern Slavic festival featuring bonfires on Saint John's Eve\nList of Celtic festivals\nScheibenschlagen – a Central European Lenten festival featuring bonfires\nWalpurgis Night – a Christian festival in Northern and Central Europe featuring bonfires in late April\n\n\n== References ==",

The party is led by Mam Xidir.\nThe party is part of the so-called Joint Working Committee of the Left of Kurdistan, alongside the Communist Party of Kurdistan – Iraq and the Kurdistan Toilers' Party. Said committee released a statement in August 2022, calling on the elimination of \"absolute centralism\" in Iraq, as well as the adoption of a separate constitution for the Kurdistan Region and the elections for the Kurdistan Region Parliament and the regional councils to be held on time. Furthermore, the statement calls on the government to stop further privatizations, to provide the salaries of public servants on time and to adopt reforms that improve the economic and social development of the people of Kurdistan.\nThe declared aims of the party are freedom, social justice, a multi-party democracy, peace and prosperity for Kurds and all peoples of Iraq. Furthermore, the MDPK supports the independence of Kurdistan and criticizes, that the division between Kurdish forces would have caused societal crises that are most felt by the working people. The Ba'athist Iraq of Saddam Hussein is referred to as \"fascist\" by the party.\nTogether with the Kurdistan Toilers' Party, the MDPK announced a boycott of the 2023 Kirkuk governorate elections. As reason for the boycott, they stated the lack of a unified Kurdish list, which would cause the Kurdish votes to be scattered.\n\n\n== References ==",

They have met several times in the latter competition including a Leinster victory in the 2009 final; as such, a healthy rivalry has developed between the two clubs. Since the first match in 1996, the sides have met 15 occasions with Leinster winning 10 and Leicester winning five. Several players have played for both clubs including Tony O'Reilly, Eric Miller, Leo Cullen, Shane Jennings, Owen Finegan, Brad Thorn, and Jimmy Gopperth. \n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Overall ===\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

They are the smallest sized among deltatheroideans, suggesting that it was a small, shrew-sized mammal.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nGurbanodelta kara nests deeply within Deltatheridiidae. Its closest relative is the largest known deltatheroidean, Nanocuris.\n\n\n== Size reduction ==\nDeltatheroideans are relatively large carnivorous mammals. By contrast, Gurbanodelta kara is a small sized species. This indicates a size reduction that potentially allowed it to survive the KT event, likely switching to an insectivorous diet.\n\n\n== References ==",

Educated in Colombia and Germany, she works in England as associate professor in exoplanets at the University College London Department of Space & Climate Physics, affiliated with the university's Mullard Space Science Laboratory.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nPinilla is originally from Bogotá, and was inspired to go into astronomy following the interest of her older brother, and by watching the television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.\nAs a student at the University of the Andes (Colombia), Pinilla earned a bachelor's degree in physics with a minor in mathematics in 2007 and a master's degree in physics in 2009. She went to Heidelberg University in Germany for doctoral study in physics, completing her Ph.D. there in 2013. Her dissertation, Testing models of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks with millimeter observations, was supervised by Cornelis P. Dullemond.\nAfter postdoctoral research at Leiden University in the Netherlands and as a NASA Hubble Fellow at the University of Arizona in the US, in 2018 she won a Sofia Kovalevskaya Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, funding her research for a five-year term as a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. She moved to her current position as associate professor at University College London in 2022.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nPinilla was a 2024 recipient of the New Horizons in Physics Prize, jointly with her coauthors Laura M. Pérez, Nienke van der Marel, and Til Birnstiel, \"for the prediction, discovery, and modeling of dust traps in young circumstellar disks, solving a long-standing problem in planet formation\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page",

Usually being held on the last week of June or early July, it provides weeklong festivities leading up to the main road parade on a Saturday. The parade will start in downtown George Town and work it’s way up the Seven Mile Beach corridor on West Bay road, eventually finishing at public beach where a post-parade celebration will take place into the night called AfterMAS, with food, concerts and many more festivities. The festival, despite only being around for 7 years, as burst in popularity and continues to grow each year.\nIt recent years, CayMAS has become a staple of a “Cayman Islands summer,” and a showcase of the island nation’s diversity and cultural heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\nCayMAS carnival began recently, in 2017; and was born out of its split from the Cayman Islands’ other main carnival event, Batabano.\nCayMAS Carnival has said on their website that they choose their dates due to many factors: summer is high tourism season in the Cayman Islands, so it will inevitably attract more jumpers (term used for parade participants) and onlookers, as well as to attract Caymanian university students studying overseas who may have missed Batabano in May. \nThe organization has also stated that they are completely non-profit, and that the “People of the Cayman Islands” own CayMAS Carnival.",

        "content": "The Rutasoka Clinic (French: Clinique Rutasoka) is a women's clinic strategically situated in Uvira within the Uvira Territory of the South Kivu Province in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The clinic specializes in providing expectant and postpartum mothers with a safe and healthy environment for childbirth, as well as medical care services. It was established in 2017 by Rebu Burubwa, a Congolese-born Swedish businessman who is also the founder of Rutasoka Coffee.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women, and sexual violence and vulnerability are widespread. Given these conditions, Rutasoka Clinic's mission is to provide women with optimal conditions for an excellent start to their motherhood and access to helpful healthcare to mitigate child and maternal mortality rates across the country.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of the Rutasoka Clinic dates back to the early 2010s when Rebu Burubwa, a Congolese-born Swedish entrepreneur, embarked on building a medical center in Uvira, the administrative hub of the Uvira Territory within the South Kivu Province, which was suffering from poverty and persecution due to the ongoing Kivu conflicts in the region. In 2015, Burubwa initiated Rutasoka Coffee, an import enterprise based in Uvira, as a pivotal component of his strategy to fortify the clinic's infrastructure. With the necessary resources in place, construction of the clinic began in 2016, and it was officially opened in 2017. It became one of the region's self-sustaining institutions, providing care for expectant and new mothers and offering a safe place for children to be born.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe Rutasoka Clinic has 15 employees and 22 rooms. Since its inception, it has provided care to over 600 patients. In addition to providing healthcare services, the clinic also offers job opportunities to the local population.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Spider  (Latvian: Zirneklis) is a 1992 erotic horror film directed by Vasily Mass, based on the 1987 story of the same name by Vladimirs Kaijaks. The film is considered a joint Soviet-Latvian work: started during the USSR, and released in independent Latvia.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nModern times. The priest commissions the artist Albert to depict the Virgin Mary. For the painting, the artist invites Vita, a young girl on the threshold of adulthood, to pose. The artist's workshop terrifies her from the very beginning   the artist's hellish paintings come to life in front of Vita, the nakedly sensual, deformed world of the canvases frightens her, and at the same time awakens her unconscious sexuality. After posing sessions, she begins to have strange mystical dreams, opening a window into the other world, full of evil and vice, where a terrifying spider wants to take possession of her. Her life is turned upside down, now populated by hallucinations, unconscious sexual desires causing a feeling of fear and helplessness. The darkness consumes and sucks in. The psychiatrist recommends sending the girl to the village, but the spider pursues Vita there too.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAurēlija Anužīte as Vita\nLiubomiras Laucevičius as Albert, artist (voiced by Timofey Spivak)\nMirdza Martinsone as Vita's mother\nSaulius Balandis as Juris\nRomualds Ancance as Aivars\nOlgerts Kroders as Arsts, psychiatrist\nAlgirdas Paulavičius as priest\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nAwarded a special mention for the screenplay at the Lielais Kristaps 1994.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nIt is believed that the film “Spider” is the first and only erotic horror film in Latvian cinema.Dmitry Karpyuk (RussoRosso) noted: A sticky web of sexual darkness, visions and dreams better than Lucio Fulci, and a fight in a bathhouse with a giant monster made no worse than David Cronenberg. A stunning and undeservedly forgotten movie.Dr. Svet Atanasov: During the Cold War era government censorship undoubtedly prevented a lot of very ambitious and talented directors in the Soviet Bloc from realizing their dreams, but the truth is that it also inspired many to be creative in some very special ways. Vasili Mass' Spider is a perfect example of a bold and very original film that exists only because it essentially tried to outsmart the people that were going to determine its fate. Unsurprisingly, it has multiple identities, though stylistically it fits somewhere between Sergei Parajanov's The Color of Pomegranates  and Andrzej Zulawski's Possession.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpider at IMDb \nSexy Latvian creature feature: The Spider (1991) // Obskura, 31 October 2012",

        "content": "Agnes Kimball (October 1881 – January 5, 1918) was an American soprano. She was a highly popular recording artist in the United States during the 1910s, and is best remembered for recordings she made during the first half of that decade with the Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, and Edison Records. A classical vocalist, her repertoire encompassed opera, operetta, musical theatre, art songs, and popular ballads; all genres which were in demand among American consumers during that period in history. Many of these recordings are included in the collection of the Library of Congress, and the Discography of American Historical Recordings has catalogued her work. \nIn live performance, Kimball spent the majority of her career working as a paid church singer. Born in Indiana, she began her career as a professional church vocalist in the early 1900s at Tabernacle Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis. When her husband took a position with Carnegie Steel she became a paid singer at Third Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh. By 1910 she had moved to New York City and was working as a singer at Brick Presbyterian Church where she was a highly paid vocalist for several years.  While she recorded pieces from operas and musicals, she never appeared in stage productions during her career. However, she did spend two seasons touring with Victor Herbert and his light opera orchestra in concerts in 1911-1912. She also toured and recorded with the Croxton Quartet, and worked as an oratorio singer on the concert stage as a member of the Oratorio Artists Quartet. At the time of her death in 1918 she was a resident singer at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Princeton, Indiana, to Bayless Grigsby and Carolyn Grigsby (née Snyder), Agnes Kimball was born Agnes Grisby in October 1881 She began performing as an amateur vocalist at public events in Princeton in 1899. In March 1899 she was a founding member of the Ladies Musicale in Princeton; an organization that was both an amateur women's choir and a group which provided its members opportunities to perform in public concerts as soloists. Performances by Kimball and the group's other members were covered in the local paper, the Princeton Clarion-Leader. In December 1899 she traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, where she performed as a guest singer with two churches. She was active as an amateur soprano soloist at the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in Princeton in 1900.\n\n\n== Vocal training and early career ==\nWhile the Indiana, U.S., Marriage Index, 1800-1941 states Agnes Grigsby married Charles F. Kimball on 12 June 1901, the public wedding ceremony for the couple took place a week later on June 19, 1901. The couple settled in Indianapolis where Agnes studied singing for several years under Franz Bellinger. Bellinger was a baritone who had studied under the famous singing teacher Giovanni Battista Lamperti, and was a respected voice teacher known for teaching from a vocal pedagogy rooted in Lamperti's methods.\nWhile studying with Bellinger, Kimball became a paid resident soprano soloist at the Tabernacle Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis, and made her professional concert debut at the Bloomington, Indiana May Festival in 1906. She then moved with her husband to Pittsburgh where she was the resident soprano soloist at Third Presbyterian Church. Her husband worked as an auditor for Carnegie Steel. They had one daughter and divorced in 1913. Kimball was by that point a well known singer, and the divorce was widely reported in the American press.\nIn 1909 Kimball was the soprano soloist in Gioachino Rossini's Stabat Mater which she performed with members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under conductor Charles S. Cornell at the graduation ceremony for California State Normal School (now Pennsylvania Western University, California). That same year she was the soprano soloist in a concert of Joseph Haydn's The Seasons in Pittsburgh. In the summer of 1910 she gave a concert at the convention of the Indiana Music Teachers Association.\n\n\n== Career in New York City and on the national concert stage ==\n\nBy March 1910 Agnes Kimball had left Pittsburgh, and had moved to New York City by herself to pursue her singing career. Her daughter, Eloise, was placed into the care of Agnes's sister, Mrs. Olive G. Lewis, at this time. She was hired as the resident soprano soloist at Brick Presbyterian Church, beginning her employment there on May 1, 1910. Kimball commanded one of the highest salaries for a church vocalist in the country while she was singing at Brick Presbyterian, and was a resident singer there from 1910-1914. She also worked as a singer periodically at Temple Beth-El among other Jewish synagogues in Manhattan.\nOne of Kimball's fellow paid singers at Brick Presbyterian was bass Frank Croxton. Croxton was also the director of the Chautauqua Chorus at the Chautauqua Institution's summer concert series, and he hired Kimball to perform as a soloist with the choir in the summer of 1910. Conductor and composer Victor Herbert, who was a leading force in American operetta, attended one of the Chautauqua concerts in which Kimball was a soloist. Impressed with her singing, he offered her a position as the lead soprano in a concert tour with his professional light opera orchestra. \nIn 1911-1912 Kimball toured the United States singing mainly excerpts from operettas in two seasons of concerts with the Victor Light Opera Orchestra. Herbert's orchestra diverged from its normal repertoire in April 1911 when they were invited by the Raleigh Choral Society to perform with them in a concert of Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah at the Sixth Annual North Carolina Festival in April 1911. Herbert conducted and Kimball sang the role of the Widow. The Hyecha Club of Tulsa sponsored Kimball, Herbert, and the orchestra when it toured to Tulsa for performances at Tulsa's sixth annual music festival in 1912. Kimball also made several recordings with the orchestra which was billed as the Victor Light Opera Company on record.\nKimball's career was also aided by Frank Croxton when he invited her to join his vocal quartet, the Croxton Quartet. The other members of that quartet included tenor Reed Miller and his wife, contralto Nevada Van der Veer. With this group, Kimball performed in concerts both in New York City and on tour, and made several recordings for a variety of record labels in 1911-1912. In 1913-1914 she was a member of the Oratorio Artists Quartet whose other members included tenor Reed Miller, bass Frederick Wheeler, and contralto Elsie West Baker (1886–1958). This group was supported by the International Lyceum Association of America; an organization part of the lyceum movement in the United States who sponsored a series of concerts across the nation featuring the Oratorio Artists Quartet.\nKimball was also active as a guest artist with other organizations. In 1911 she was the soprano soloist in George Frideric Handel's Messiah with the Apollo Chorus of Chicago at the Auditorium Theatre. In 1913 she performed in a benefit concert in St. Louis that was organized and conducted by composer George Balch Nevin. In 1915 she performed at the very first music festival organized in the city of Bowling Green, Ohio. That same year she gave a recital at Aeolian Hall in Indianapolis sponsored by the Aeolian Company.\n\n\n== Later life in Ohio and death ==\n\nIn 1914 Kimball married a second time, this time to businessman and manufacturer Edward T. Affleck. At the time of their marriage, Affleck was vice president of Electric Autolite in Toledo, Ohio. She spent the last years of her career as a paid soprano soloist at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Toledo.\nShortly before Christmas Day in 1917, Agness Kimball became seriously ill and was hospitalized at Flower Hospital in Toledo, Ohio (now ProMedica Flower Hospital in Sylvania, Ohio). She died there on January 5, 1918. At the time of her death, the Detroit Free Press described her as a \"singer at the forefront of church soloists\" who had \"sung for all the prominent record companies\" and earned a \"national reputation\".\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nAccording to musicologist Leo Riemens and music biographer Karl-Josef Kutsch in their biography on Kimball in the Großes Sängerlexikon, Kimball was a very popular recording artist in the United States during the 1910s and she recorded music with wide appeal to Amercan audiences of that period.  Although she never appeared as a singing actress on the stage, her recorded repertoire encompassed music spanning from operettas and musical theatre to ballads and excerpts from operas and oratorios. She made numerous recordings for a variety of American record labels from 1910 to 1913.\nWith the Croxton Quartet, Kimball recorded \"Te sol, te sol quest'anima\" (sung in English as \"Praise ye the Lord\") from the third act of Giuseppe Verdi's Attila (1910, Edison Records);  \"Gypsy love song\" from Victor Herbert's The Fortune Teller (1911, Edison Records); and \"Medley of Christmas carols\" (1911, Columbia Records). With the Victor Light Opera Company (VLOC) she made several records in 1911 for the Victor Talking Machine Company (VTMC). The first of these was \"Gems from Florodora\" which consisted of selections from the opera of that name by Leslie Stuart; among them the famous double sextet, \"Tell me pretty maiden\". This was followed by similar records of operetta selections: \"Gems from The Sultan of Sulu\" by composer Alfred George Wathall; \"Gems from Rob Roy \" by composer Reginald de Koven; and \"Gems from A Runaway Girl \" with music by composers Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton. \nKimball was a member of the VTMC's \"Victor Opera Quartet\" with whom she recorded several solo arias as well as works for multiple singers. These included  the arias \"Un bel dì, vedremo\" (sung in English as \"Some day he'll come\") from Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly (1911), and \"Spring Song\" from Herbert and Joseph Redding's Natoma (1912); and the quartet \"Bella figlia dell'amore\" from Act III of Verdi's Rigoletto. For Victor she also recorded the aria \"Hear ye, Israel\" from Mendelssohn's Elijah in 1911, and in 1912 the art songs \"Far off I hear a lover's flute\" from Charles Wakefield Cadman's song cycle Four American Indian Songs, Op. 45.; \"Die Loreley\" by Franz Liszt; and \"O komm mit mir in die Frühlings-nacht\" (sung in English as \"O come with me in the Summer night\") by Frank Van der Stucken.\nFor Columbia Records, Kimball recorded the song \"Adele\" from the musical of that name by Jean Briquet and Adolf Philipp in 1913. She recorded several more songs that year with Columbia, including \"Love is a story that's old\" from Victor Herbert's operetta The Madcap Duchess; the duet \"You're here and I'm here\" from Jerome Kern's musical The Laughing Husband (sung with tenor Charles W. Harrison); and the duet \"Come on over here\" from the Leo Fall and Harry B. Smith musical The Doll Girl (also sung with Harrison).\nIn reviewing Kimball's singing on her recordings of \"Hear ye, Israel\" and \"Far off I hear a lover's flute\", Riemens & Kutsch stated that Kimball \"showed a beautifully controlled and technically excellent soprano voice.\"\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAndrews, H.

        "content": "The Korg Sigma KP-30 is a monophonic analog synthesizer released by Korg in 1979. The Sigma features two synthesizer engines – Synthe and Instrument, which can be adjusted and then mixed and layered together. Designed for live performance, it includes two modulation joysticks and an aftertouch-sensitive keyboard. The Sigma was released alongside the Korg Delta, a hybrid string machine and polysynth, and the Lambda ES50, a preset keyboard that combined string and piano voices. The Sigma was used by Rick Wakeman, who substituted his Minimoogs with four Sigmas, as well as Keith Emerson.\n\n\n== Sounds and features ==\nThe Sigma is a preset synthesizer with two independent sections: 'Synthe' and 'Instruments,' which are mixed at the output stage and also feature separate audio outputs. Preset sounds are chosen using organ-style switches, with 11 grey switches for Instruments on the right side of the front panel and eight white switches for the Synthe section in the centre. Each switch is paired with a single knob that adjusts a specific parameter for its corresponding sound.\nThe 11 Instrument presets are arranged by pitch and span from a 32' Electric Bass to a 4' Hammered Percussion, each with adjustable parameters like Tone, Filter Cutoff, Attack, Decay, or Pulse Width, tailored to the specific preset. The Synthe section features waveforms including sawtooth and pulse waves across multiple octaves, complemented by envelope controls for decay on certain waves and combined attack and release on others. It features a pulse wave with pulse-width modulation (PWM) as well as a white noise generator with adjustable attack and release times. Both Synthe and Instrument signals can feed into a ring modulator to create metallic sounds, and the Synthe can be detuned relative to the Instrument section to create subtle chorusing. Multiple presets can be activated at once, enhancing presets that may seem weak individually by combining them for a fuller sound.\nThe Sigma features two joysticks for modulation control: the left joystick adjusts LFO modulation (vibrato), noise modulation, and pitch bend. The right joystick controls the Sigma's high- and low-pass filter cutoff frequencies, with low-pass modulation from left to right and high-pass from front to back. The keyboard's aftertouch capability also allows for pitch bend and vibrato control, with customizable sensitivity and bend direction as well as the ability to modulate the Instrument or Synthe sounds separately.\n\n\n== Software ==\nIn 2017, Full Bucket Music released Stigma, a free digital emulation of the Korg Sigma, enhanced with modern capabilities including 64-voice polyphony, a chorus effect and preset management.\n\n\n== References ==",

The name Shëmri is thought to derive from it, with the Albanian translation for Saint Mary being Shën Mëri.\nShëmri was recorded as Shinmiri in three different 16th-century Ottoman censuses, and as Shën Mëri by Frang Bardhi and sq:Shtjefën Gaspri in 1638 and 1671 respectively.\nFrom the 18th century onwards it is recorded as Shëmri.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

He made his debut in the Biathlon World Cup in  2020.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOscar Lombardot began his international career in the IBU Junior Cup races close to his hometown in Les Rousses towards the end of 2018. Subsequently, he participated in the 2019 Junior World Championships in Osrblie the following year, achieving top ten placements twice. Following another top 10 finish in the 2019/20 Junior Cup, Lombardot selected to the IBU Cup in January, also held in Osrblie. His debut in the World Cup races in Hochfilzen by the end of 2020 led to finishes of 81st and 86th place. Shortly after, he secured podium placements in the relay and mixed relay at Arber, and clinched his first gold medal at the 2021 Junior World Championships in Obertilliach alongside Sébastien Mahon, Éric Perrot, and Émilien Claude. During the winter of 2021/22, Lombardot attained his highest individual ranking, securing seventh place in the short individual race in Osrblie, which he then surpassed with a fourth-place finish in the individual race at the European Championships. He later secured his second relay gold at the 2022 Junior World Championships, this time with Rémi Broutier, Paul Fontaine, and Jacques Jefferies. Following a promising start to the 2021/22 season, Lombardot achieved his first two individual podium finishes in Ridnaun. He also replaced Éric Perrot at the Pokljuka World Cup, earning his first World Cup points with a 38th-place finish in the pursuit. This was surpassed by a 35th-place finish in the pursuit in Antholz. While the World Championships and the end of the season didn't yield success in individual competitions, Lombardot competed in his first World Cup relay in Östersund, finishing second behind the Norwegian team with Antonin Guigonnat, Éric Perrot, and Fabien Claude. Following his strong performances during the previous winter season, Oscar Lombardot has been selected for the first time to the A team for the 2023–2024 season.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Championships ===\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n==== Relay podiums ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Operated by the Bank of Montreal as one of its current branches, it is located on 2 King Street, at the southeast corner of King and Prince William Streets. Built in 1878 and used by the Bank of Montreal since its completion, it is a Second Empire style structure built using sandstone. The Domville Building is located within the Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Domville Building was built in 1878. Named after Canadian Parliament member James Domville, it was one of Saint John's first major commercial buildings following the Great Fire in 1877. On August 5, 1878, the cornerstone for the Domville Building was laid and presented to Domville himself. It was set to be occupied by the Maritime Bank and the Bank of Montreal, but it would also be used as offices for the Canadian Pacific Railway, an insurance office, and as a bar and restaurant. The building has also been used to host political meetings. On March 18, 1982, the Domville Building was recognized as a historic building under New Brunswick's Municipal Heritage Preservation Act, with architecture featuring a Second Empire style built using sandstone. The building continues to be used by the Bank of Montreal as one of its branches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of historic places in Saint John County, New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Saint Nicholas, Theodor and Stylianos Church is one of the two Orthodox churches in Balotești, Ilfov County, Romania.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was constructed in 1763 by the custodian of the princely mines, the Greek nobleman Zamfirache, and his wife Elena. The church is dedicated to Saints Nicholas, Theodore Tiron, and Stelian. Constructed in the shape of a cross, it features two domes on the roof, one serving as a bell tower until 1944 when the bell was hidden to prevent seizure by German forces. The church walls are a meter thick, and the interior is illuminated by five windows, each with a round vent covered by a filigree stone rosette for ventilation. Over time, renovations were made, including enclosing the church porch with doors and windows, and adding two smaller windows to the altar area.\nThe church bell, cast in 1906 with the assistance of Minister of Agriculture Ioan Lahovary, has since fallen into disrepair despite several attempts at welding. The church underwent various repairs over the years, including consolidations in 1822, 1868, 1965, and major renovations in 1982–1984.\nRestoration works, including the painting, were carried out in 1992–1993, with support from local authorities, private firms, and the Romanian Orthodox Church. The names of parish priests since Stan are inscribed on the wall near the Prothesis.\nThe church's frescoes, last restored in 1993 by the painter Romeo Andronic, faithfully adhere to the original artwork. The iconostasis, made of stone, was also painted and restored in fresco.\nDespite its historical significance, the church does not possess any national heritage objects.\nThere is a cemetery where Balotești citizens are buried.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

        "content": "19th century glass categories in the United States include types of glass and decoration methods for glass. A simplified category version appropriate at the beginning of the century is glassware, bottles, and windows. As the century progressed, glass production became more complex and made necessary more categories and subcategories. An 1884 United States government report used glassware, bottles, windows, and plate glass as major categories—although plate glass accounted for only four percent of the value of all glass made.\nAlthough window glass was made using the Crown method or the Cylinder method at the start of the century, the cylinder method was dominant by mid-century. By the 1870s, glassware could be lead crystal or made from soda-lime, with crystal including lead as a key additive while soda-lime glass excludes lead. Glassware could also be decorated by cutting, engraving, or etching. Bottles continued to be made with low–quality green glass, but some bottles were made with high–quality glass and decorated.\nDuring the last decade of the century, wire glass was being produced in addition to window and plate glass. One government report used the category \"building glass\" to represent window, plate, and wire glass. Shatter-resistant glass was invented in Europe and would be introduced by an American manufacturer in 1915. Research was being conducted in the United States and Europe that would dramatically change the way window glass was manufactured in the next century. In France, Émile Fourcault was developing the Fourcault process for making window glass. In the United States, Irving Wightman Colburn would later be joined by Michael J. Owens to develop a similar window making process.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nPrior to the American Revolution, there were three types of glass made in the British colonies that would become the United States. Those categories were green glass, soda glass, and lead glass. In 1800, the United States was thought to have no more than ten operating glass factories. Most of these factories produced window glass or bottles made of green glass, and very little high quality glassware was made. Despite the War of 1812 and a trade war with Britain, the United States had at least 33 glass factories by 1820. The Tariff of 1824, which was a protective tariff, helped the American glass industry grow to nearly 70 glass factories over the next two decades. By the middle of the century, the United States had 94 glass works producing various types of glass—including glassware. Leading glassware manufacturers in the 1870s were Bakewell, Pears, & Company; Boston & Sandwich Glass; J. B. Dobleman; J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company; Mount Washington Glass; and New England Glass Company.\nIn 1884 the Census Office of the United States Department of the Interior released Report on the Manufacture of Glass by Joseph D. Weeks. This report, which contained over 100 pages, used four \"general varieties\" to classify glass plus additional \"sub–varieties\". For the 1880, 169 establishments produced glass products in the United States. Glassware was produced at 73 facilities, while green glass was made at 42. Window glass was made at 49 glass works, while plate glass was made at five establishments. The total value of all glass products produced was $21,154,571 (equivalent to $667,900,869 in 2023). Glassware accounted for 45 percent of the total value of glass products made in 1880; while green glass, window glass, and plate glass had percentages of 27, 24, and four, respectively.\nThe total value of all glass products produced in the United States grew to $41,051,004 (equivalent to $1,392,085,158 in 2023) in 1889, and for 1899 it was $56,539,712 (equivalent to $2,070,710,412 in 2023). Bottles and jars accounted for about 38 percent of the 1899 total, while building glass (window, plate, wire, other building) and pressed & blown glass (mostly glassware) both accounted for about 30 percent. (The other two percentage points are rounding plus an \"All other products\" category.)\n\n\n== Major categories of glass ==\n\nFlint glass is usually glassware, although it can be bottles and lamp chimneys. The glass composition could either include lead (usually called crystal) or soda and lime (soda–lime glass). In the 21st century, flint glass refers to crystal.\nGreen or \"bottle\" glass has a clear greenish (sometimes brownish) color because of impurities such as iron in the sand used in the batch—and a lack of additives used to remove the greenish tint or add a more pleasing color. In the English colonies that would become the United States, most glass produced was green glass until the 1760s when one glass works began producing high quality lead crystal. Green glass of the 19th century is different from green glass, such as Uranium glass, deliberately colored green by using additives.\nPlate glass was made by pouring molten glass onto a table, and then polishing it after it hardened. Plate glass is generally thicker than window glass, takes longer to anneal, and undergoes intensive grinding and polishing to produce its finish. It is used for mirrors, tabletops, and large windows.\nWindow glass production during most of the 19th century involved a glassblower making a long hollow cylinder that was cut lengthwise and flattened—known as the Cylinder method. By the end of the 19th century, the Lubbers glassblowing machine was created to eliminate the need for glassblowers in the window glass process, and work began early in the next century that would radically change the entire production method.\n\n\n== Other categories of glass ==\nBorosilicate glass was created between 1887 and 1893 in Germany by Otto Schott. This type of glass is less likely to shatter because it is tolerant to sudden changes in temperature. Borosilicate glass was not made in the United States until 1915, when Corning Glass Works introduced its Pyrex glass.\nCrystal glass (sometimes called flint glass) is a high-quality clear glass that needs an additive known as red lead. In the British colonies that would become the United States, crystal began being produced right before 1770 by a works led by Henry William Stiegel in the Province of Pennsylvania. The Stiegel works ended production in 1774. Glass works such as New England Glass Company, and Pittsburgh's Bakewell glass works, were producers of crystal early in the 19th century. The Seneca Glass Company was one of the few glass works still making lead crystal glassware late in the 19th century, and it continued using 19th century technology through much of the 20th century.\nSoda–lime glass (a.k.a. lime–soda glass or lime glass) was re–discovered in 1864 by William Leighton of the J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company glass works in Wheeling, West Virginia. The glass made using his formula had good enough quality that the company could compete in the high-end of the glassware market. The ingredients used to make the glass were lower-cost than those used to make lead glass. In addition, the glass hardened faster, meaning the workforce was forced to shape or press it quicker. Professor Warren C. Scoville of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in an essay titled Growth of the American Glass Industry to 1880, considered the new soda-lime formula second only to mechanical pressing among the five outstanding American glassmaking innovations up to that time.\nWindow glass, crown method was made by having a glassblower blow a gob of glass until it was shaped like a hollow globe. The globe was transferred from the glassblower to a worker where the globe would be cut open and twirled with a rod as it flattened into a large disc. When the worker removed the rod used for twirling, it would leave a \"bullseye\" in the center of the glass. The disc would be annealed in a kiln for two to three weeks. A cutter would then cut the flattened glass into the desired dimensions. In the United States, the few window glassmaking companies that used the crown method ended production using that process shortly after 1850, although some crown glass was made at the end of the century for decorative purposes.\nWindow glass, cylinder method starts like the crown method, only the gob of glass is blown into a large hollow cylinder. The cylinder is cut on both ends, and then cut lengthwise so it can be flattened in a flattening oven. Although window glass made using the cylinder method did not have as good of a finish as that made using the crown method, it had a more uniform thickness of the glass which caused fewer distortions. It also could be cut into bigger pieces with less waste. This method was the only one used to make window glass in the United States during the last half of the 19th century. By 1920 it was mostly replaced by radically different methods for making window glass. In the United States, the last window glass company to use the cylinder method was the LeFevre Glass Company in 1926.\nWindow glass, Fourcault process was invented in 1901 by a Belgian glassmaker named Émile Fourcault. This process uses a machine to draw molten glass vertically, and has no need for a glassblower or glassblowing machine. By 1925, as many as 14 drawing machines had been placed over one furnace in some cases. Annealing is also quicker than the cylinder method. The process was finalized in Belgium, and was not used in the United States until 1923 when it began being used by the Blackford Window Glass Company in Vincennes, Indiana.\nWindow glass, Libbey-Owens process (also called the Colburn process) began being developed by Irving Wightman Colburn after he observed a paper–making machine in 1905. After running out of funding, his patents were sold at auction in 1912. The patents were purchased by the Toledo Glass Company, which was owned by Edward Libbey and Michael Owens. Colburn and Owens continued work on Colburn's process, and by 1917 it was improved enough to produce window glass. In this process, glass is melted in a tank furnace before moving into a trough where it is drawn. The glass is drawn vertically, but after it reaches a bending roller it is drawn horizontally. Annealing is conducted in a lehr that is 20 feet (6.1 m) long.\nWire glass, a variation of plate glass made after 1892, uses wire within the glass as reinforcement. Frank Shuman developed the process for embedding wire in glass.\n\n\n== Decorating glass ==\n\nCased glass consists of at least two layers of different colored glass. Also known as overlay glass, this technique did not see extensive use until the 1850s, and peaked in production during the 1860s.\nCut glass has been decorated by cutting groves or depressions in its surface. The process involves making the cut, smoothing, and then polishing. The work was done by a glass cutter holding the glass against a wheel on a lathe. The Romans are known to have cut glass, and glass cutting was rediscovered by Germans in the 17th Century. The technique spread to the British Isles before it was brought to the Unite States during the late 18th Century. Pittsburgh's Bakewell and Company was an early 19th century glassmaking firm that became known for its cut glass.\nEnameled glass has been decorated by enamel paint. The enamel typically contained lead, tin, and a metallic oxide ground into a powder. It was mixed with an oil and fused to the glass. It may have been practiced in New Amsterdam by Dutch glassmakers, and was definitely used in Pennsylvania by Henry William Stiegel's Manheim glasshouse during the 1770s. The Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company, the largest producer of lamps and shades in the United States in the 1890s, produced as many as 400 dozen hand–painted lamps per day.\nEngraved glass in the 19th century United States was made using copper wheels on a lathe. It is a more exacting method of decoration compared to cutting glass. It was introduced to the English colonies (eventually the United States) by German glass workers during the last half of the 18th century.\nEtched glass has been decorated by using chemicals. The glass is covered with an acid-resistant wax, portions of the wax are scratched off, and the acid is applied. This technique was used mainly in the late 19th century.\nGilded glass has been decorated with gold paint. The gold is paint consists of brown oxide of gold or a gold salt mixed with oil or water. Firing the paint onto the glass leaves it dull until it is polished. Gilding was probably not practiced in the United States until about 1820.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== References ===",

Its only crewed flight was conducted in 1976 with Soyuz 22 of the Soyuz programme. \n\n\n== Design and flight ==\n\nThe one craft of the Soyuz 7K-MF6 was modified from the original Soyuz 7K-TM/Soyuz 7K-T with the addition of observatory platform.  The Soyuz 7K-MF6 flew once on Soyuz 22. Soyuz 7K-MF6 propulsion was from a KTDU-80, liquid rocket engine. Soyuz 7K-MF6 was the second Soviet manned space observatory, the first was Soyuz 13/Soyuz 7K-T-AF. Soyuz 7K-MF6/Soyuz 2 housed the MKF-6 multi-spectral camera. The spectral camera was used for photography of Earth. The multi-spectral camera was manufactured by Carl Zeiss-Jena in East Germany. The universal docking port was removed and a multispectral camera was installed in its place. The observatory equipment was added to the top of nose cone of the spacecraft. Soyuz 7K-MF6 started as the back up spacecraft for the Apollo–Soyuz project, a Soyuz ASTP craft # 74. The Soyuz ASTP was modified in 1976 to become 7K-MF6, after it was not need for the Apollo–Soyuz project that ended in 1975, which used spacecraft Soyuz 19 and Apollo CSM-111. \n\n\n== See also ==\nComparison of crewed space vehicles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRSC Energia: Concept Of Russian Manned Space Navigation Development\nMir Hardware Heritage\nDavid S.F.

The  premiere of the film took place on April 7, 2024.\n\n\n== Рlot ==\nThe author's monologue addressed to his little son Alyosha. An almost plotless series of sketches about nature and loss, guilt and childhood trauma. Great tragedies here coexist with simple joys, a walk through the forest brings back memories of saying goodbye to an arrested father, the cry of a child during a nap becomes a parting with infancy. The flow of thought, the alternation of images turns the story into an attempt to either reconstruct or build a world of childhood happiness and understand why and at what moment each of us loses this little paradise.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nIvan Urgant as father\nLeonid Bichevin\nPolina Agureeva\nAlyona Kuchkova\nNadezhda Markina\nLev Ruzanov as Alyosha\nYevgeny Zharinov as narrator\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in St. Petersburg and the Novgorod Oblast, and was produced by the Alexander Sokurov's Foundation.\n\n\n=== Attempts of a ban ===\nThe head of the Russian Federal Project on Security and Anti-Corruption, Vitaly Borodin, appealed to the Ministry of Culture with a request not to issue a distribution certificate for the film,  which was directed by Nikolay Solodnikov, the husband of Katerina Gordeeva, recognized as a foreign agent in Russia. Borodin also called Urgant, Solodovnikov and Sokurov “Russophobes”.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The battle of Bonefield (Hungarian: Csontmezei csata) in other sources battle of Bone Hill (Hungarian: Csonthegyi csata) was fought between the army of John Corvinus and an army of the Kingdom of Hungary (the party of queen Beatrice of Naples) under Pál Kinizsi and Stephen V Báthory after the death of Matthias Corvinus king of Hungary, on 4 July 1490, in the Bonefield, a part of Tolna county near the extinct village Szabaton (nowday Kölesd in Hungary.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKing Matthias never had children from his legal marriages. Because of this, he wanted to inherit the kingdom to his illegitimate son John Corvinus. After father's death the Hungarian rule quickly collapsed in the Habsburg lands (Styria, Carniola, Lower Austria). The Bohemians (Vladislaus Jagiellon) and Poles (John I Albert and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I also claimed the Hungarian throne. Due to the foreign wars of Matthias in Austria and Bohemia and his extraordinary taxes, the lords (just like Kinizsi) did not support his son.\n\n\n== The battle ==\nThe 17-year-old John did not inherit his father's brilliant talent. His stepmother Beatrice was also against him. Báthory and Kinizsi, Matthias's great generals, also supported the queen. John was supported only by two ecclesiastical dignitaries and two lords.\nJohn was in 13 July 1490 induced formally to resign his claims to the throne, on the understanding that he was to be compensated with the royal title of Kingdom of Bosnia and title of Ban of Croatia. A some days later John's supporters, Sigismund Ernuszt bishop of Pécs, Lawrence of Ilok and Bertalan Beriszló recruited an army and entered Buda. John changed his mind, but did not stay in the capital. His supporters suggested John that he march to the Southern land and fill your own army with other supporters of the Corvin-party. John also took with him the stock of the king's treasury.\nBáthory and Kinizsi immediately pursued John's army. Their troops catch up John's forces in Tolna county. During that time, John hesitated and wanted to return to the capital, but his supporters blackmailed him and forced him to fight the battle with Kinizsi and Báthory.\nThe troops of Kinizsi and Báthory (6–7 thousands men) discovered John's army (7000 men) by the river Sárvíz on the Bonefield (Csontmező). John's troops tried to initiate on the battlefield, but the inexperienced peasant soldiers were easily repulsed by the experienced troops of Kinizsi and Báthory.\nLawrence of Ilok rescued John from the battle. The enemy no longer pursued them, but he was busy robbing the vagons.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the losing battle John lost all chance of getting the throne of Hungary. He was also recognized as duke of Slavonia and Opava, but compelled to relinquish both titles five years later. In 1498 he was created perpetual Ban of Croatia and Slavonia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCorvin János vereséget szenved a csontmezei csatában – Rubicon Online (Hungarian)\nAz apa árnyékában: az ismeretlen Corvin János – Magyar Nemzet (Hungarian)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKubinyi, András (1991): Két sorsdöntő esztendő (1490–1491).

        "content": "Bertram Mitford Heron Rogers (25 August 1860 – 10 February 1953) was an English footballer who played in the 1880 FA Cup Final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRogers was the second son of Thorold Rogers and was born at 4 Wellington Place in Oxford.  He attended the School of Art in Oxford and Magdalen College School in Oxford, before going up to Westminster School.  He represented Westminster at cricket, averaging 10 with the bat over 15 innings in 1877.\nIn 1876, Rogers discovered the body of his older brother, Henry, who had hanged himself, at the family home in Oxford, and gave extensive evidence at the inquest.\nRogers went up to Exeter College, Oxford in January 1880, and took his Bachelor of Arts in 1883.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nHis first known football match was for the North Oxford club against Newbury in February 1880, as a forward; although Westminster was known as a footballing nursery, he never represented the school.\nHowever Rogers was a late bloomer, as his appearance for North Oxford led to him being chosen the following month for the Oxford University side as a half-back in the 1879–80 FA Cup quarter-final tie with the Royal Engineers; by coincidence, the captain at the start of the season had been another Rogers (Percy John Mackarness), but he was no relation.  Rogers' first three competitive matches came inside a week - the original tie with the Sappers, the replay after the original match was drawn, and, in between, the Varsity match against Cambridge.  He played as half-back in all three matches, which were all played at the Kennington Oval.  Oxford beat the Sappers in the replay, but lost the Varsity.  \nRogers kept his place in the win over Nottingham Forest in the semi-final, and, in the final against Clapham Rovers, \"greatly distinguished\" himself, but the Rovers clinched the game with a late goal.\nRogers only appears in two more matches, a 4–0 win over Maidenhead in October 1880, and again on the losing side in the Varsity in February 1881.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRogers became a doctor of medicine, living in Clifton, Bristol, and on 2 October 1891 married Agnes Fletcher at Carfax.  The couple had two daughters.\nHe was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a licenciate of the Royal College of Physicians, and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, being appointed Lieutenant in 1908.  By 1921 he was a lieutenant-colonel and was made an Officer of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in October 1927.\nHe was an author of a number of medical papers, and edited a handbook to Bristol for the British Association in 1898, contributing a chapter on meteorology.\nHe returned to Oxford in retirement, where he died on 10 February 1953, with his daughters being granted probate; his estate was worth over £27,800.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reverse parliamentarism (Portuguese: Parlamentarismo às avessas) was the political system in force in the Brazilian Empire during the Second Reign. This system consisted of the Conservative and Liberal parties alternating at the head of the executive branch, based on the choice of the Moderator.\nIn 1847, Decree No. 523 created the position of President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister), who became head of the Executive Branch and organized the government cabinet. Thus, the Emperor no longer appointed all the ministers, but only the President of the council, who, in turn, chose the other members of his ministry, in agreement with parliament, removing an element of political wear and tear from the monarch, without diminishing his authority, in a system mirrored in British parliamentarism.\n\n\n== British and Brazilian parliaments ==\nThe hierarchy of classical parliamentarism and Brazilian parliamentarism was inverted, hence the name \"reverse parliamentarism\".In the UK, the Crown, based on the majority of parliament and who they advise, chooses the prime minister. Parliament then approves or disapproves this decision. This person will be the country's head of government, running and managing the UK. Although appointed by the monarch, taking into account the composition of the legislature, the prime minister must account for his actions only to parliament, which, if it deems it necessary, can remove him from office.In Brazilian parliamentarianism, the monarch waited for the legislative elections and chose the President of the council from the party with the majority in parliament. However, according to the 1824 Constitution, he was not obliged to do this and could choose any politician, from any party, for the post. Therefore, as a rule, the head of government's name was chosen or nominated before the elections, and it was up to him to organize the ballot. As the electoral system was largely based on fraud and the influence of local political bosses, the party in power usually achieved a majority in the Chamber, confirming the Emperor's choice and maintaining the fictitious alternation of power.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCarvalho, José Murilo de (1996).

        "content": "St Andrew's Church is the parish church of Langley Mill in Derbyshire, England. It was built in 1911 by J S Brocklesby and was dedicated to Saint Andrew in 1912 by the Bishop of Southwell. In 1926, the church became part of the Diocese of Derby. The church is an active place of worship and community hub. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1988 by Historic England.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was originally built between 1911 and 1913. The original place of worship was in a small room above a builder's workshop on Elnor Street. It soon proved too small and builder J S Brocklesby was asked to build a new church for the congregation. At a cost of £8,000 (£780,056.08 in 2024 with inflation). The church was built in an unusual Arts and Crafts style which was quite unusual for a church at the time as they were often built in Gothic Revival and Victorian Style. The church was finally built in 1913, a year prior it was consecrated by the Bishop of Southwell. In 1926, it became part of the Diocese of Derby. It became a joint Methodist and Anglican church in 1987. A year later, it was listed as Grade II by Historic England. The listing entry quotes the following:\n\n\"Double chamfered rubble tower arch on ashlar double half shafts with scalloped capitals. To either side at junction with nave walls there are small squinches supporting the tower buttresses. Inside the tower has a ribbed groin vault. Nave and chancel have double purlin roofs with boarded ceilings. East and west and south aisle windows all have Neo-Norman colonnettes with scalloped capitals. Neo-Norman circular stone font in aisle and similar style triple sedilia and piscina to chancel. Gothic style timber pulpit, timber screen into south transept bay from crossing and choir stalls. Painted reredos to chancel and turned baluster altar rails. Stained glass window to some northern and the east window.\" - Historic England, 1988\nToday, it remains an active place of worship and lies close to Derbyshire's border with Nottinghamshire. The Erewash Valley Line passes by the church and serves the nearby railway station at Langley Mill.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade II listed buildings in Derbyshire\nListed buildings in Derbyshire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to St Andrew's Church, Langley Mill at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "We Sang, Therefore We Were is the solo debut album of Deerhoof drummer Greg Saunier, set for release on April 26, 2024, by Joyful Noise Recordings. Saunier wrote, played, and recorded the whole album himself. It was preceded by one single.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nPer Saunier, he was convinced to make a solo record by his Deerhoof bandmates \"as a way to cope with the restlessness I've been feeling\", in conversations in early December 2023. Saunier started on the album soon after, and found that \"With no one to please but myself, it came together way faster than usual. It was basically done by the holidays.\" Saunier wrote, played, and recorded the whole album himself.\n\n\n== Release ==\nWe Sang, Therefore We Were was announced on April 8, 2024, with a release date set for April 26, by Joyful Noise Recordings. The announcement came with the release of lead single \"Grow Like a Plant\", which came with a music video featuring dancer Sophie Daws. The song was described by BrooklynVegan's Bill Pearis as \"funky, skronky and glammy at the same time\". On the song, Saunier said: This song addresses that annoying quirk of the homosapien mind where it thinks it's made of higher quality molecules than the rest of the universe. For millennia civilizations managed to temper this suicidal arrogance with ritual. Until 500 years ago, when a handful of self-appointed experts invented the Enlightenment, proposing that men can solve any problem given enough brooding and/or physical violence; that the cosmos is actually nothing but an inert blob of matter for us to buy and sell. What if this is all wrong? What if it's humans who are really the mindless instinct-machines, competing for territory, food, and mates, and it's the plant and animal kingdoms that secretly know how to think and have fun?\n\n\n== Influence ==\nAt first intrigued by the Rolling Stones's 2023 album Hackney Diamonds being described as \"angry\", he was disappointed to find the album sounded \"more like cotton candy than punk rock\". Subsequently, he turned to Nirvana, saying that he \"always loved the catchy melody over massive distortion, the way their songs refused to conform to simple major or minor scales, the dark sarcasm which still resonates in this age of phony blue-check-washing of fascism.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGreg Saunier – vocals, all instruments, producer, recording, mixing, mastering\nRyan Hover – cover art, layout\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 SpeedyCash.com 250 was the 7th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and the 26th iteration of the event. The race was held on Friday, April 12, 2024, at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, a 1.5 miles (2.4 km) permanent asphalt quad-oval shaped intermediate speedway. The race took the scheduled 167 laps to complete. Kyle Busch, driving for Spire Motorsports, would take advantage of the lead on the final restart, and held off a fast charge from Corey Heim in the final few laps to earn his 66th career NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series win, and his second of the season. Busch would also win the race in dominating fashion, winning both stages and leading a race-high 112 laps. With his win, he ties Todd Bodine for the most Truck Series wins at Texas Motor Speedway with six. To fill out the podium, Nick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, would finish 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nTexas Motor Speedway is a speedway located in the northernmost portion of the U.S. city of Fort Worth, Texas – the portion located in Denton County, Texas.

        "content": "The Cut is an online publication that, as part of New York magazine, covers a wide range of topics, such as work, money, sex and relationships, fashion, mental health, pop culture, politics, and parenting, with a specific lens for women. Launched in 2008 as a fashion blog, it became a stand-alone vertical in 2012 and shifted its focus from fashion to a broader range of topics. Stella Bugbee, who launched the site as editorial director in August 2012, became editor-in-chief in 2017, the same year the site unveiled a mobile-first redesign and new site sections: Style, Self, Culture, and Power. Since 2018, the Cut has had Spring Fashion and Fall Fashion print issues that run on the flip side of New York Magazine’s own biweekly edition. In 2019, the Cut’s then-parent company, New York Media, merged with Vox Media. In 2021, Lindsay Peoples became the publication’s second editor-in-chief. Under Peoples, the site’s mission is “to be the thing you share in your group chats, because we want to be that community. We’re not trying to preach or be judgmental; we just want to have a conversation.” To meet advertising and subscriber demand, the Cut expanded its editorial team in 2024 to continue to grow its coverage and readership. Cover stars for the Cut under Peoples’s leadership have included Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Naomi Campbell, Simone Biles, and the women of Euphoria.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2015, the Cut published a New York Magazine cover feature by Noreen Malone that included interviews with 35 women who had accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. The cover image and photo portfolio by Amanda Demme included portraits of all the women seated and an empty chair to symbolize those unable to come forward. In 2018, the Cut published an essay by Moira Donegan in which she revealed herself as the creator of the “Shitty Media Men” list that contained rumors and allegations of sexual misconduct by men in the magazine world. Later that year, Lindsay Peoples’s essay “Everywhere and Nowhere,” about the challenges of being a Black voice in the fashion industry, came out, sending a “ripple of waves through the industry.” An excerpt from E. Jean Carroll’s book What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal ran in 2019 on the Cut and on the cover of New York’s print magazine, in which she first shared her story of being sexually assaulted by then-President Donald Trump. In 2022, the Cut ran a special package that highlighted resources for accessing an abortion nationwide following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. \nThe Cut is known for a number of columns, including Madame Clairevoyant’s weekly horoscopes; as-told-tos in “Sex Diaries”; and the “How I Get It Done” series, highlighting the routines of influential women. The Cut has published widely read personal essays including Emily Gould on the “Lure of Divorce,” Grazie Sophia Christie on “The Case for Marrying an Older Man,” and Charlotte Cowles’s “The Day I Put $50,000 in a Shoe Box and Handed It to a Stranger”. \nIn 2018, the Cut launched a T-shirt shop at Amazon. The Cut expanded into e-commerce with the Cut Shop, a digital boutique giving readers shopping recommendations spanning fashion, beauty, wellness, and home products. In 2023, Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin? podcast joined New York.\n\n\n== Film and television ==\nThe 2015 story “The Hustlers at Scores” was released as the 2019 blockbuster Hustlers. The May 2018 story “Maybe She Had So Much Money She Just Lost Track of It” chronicled Anna Delvey’s rise and became the basis of the Netflix limited series Inventing Anna. In November 2018, the Cut published “The Watcher,” which was later adapted into a Netflix limited series of the same name, created by Ryan Murphy. The Cut’s “Sex Diaries” column, which started in 2007 and asks anonymous city dwellers to record a week in their sex lives, was the basis of a 2022 docuseries on HBO.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2015, the New York Magazine cover story on Bill Cosby’s accusers, which ran on the Cut, won the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting. In 2017, Lindsay Peoples won an ASME Next Award for her work as an editor at the Cut. In 2018, the Cut was named Website of the Year on Adweek’s “Publishing Hot List” and was part of New York’s submission for its 2018 National Magazine Award win for Best Website. The Cut and New York writer-at-large Rebecca Traister also won the National Magazine Award for Columns and Commentary that year. The Cut on Tuesdays, its first podcast, won the 2020 Gracie Award for Best Podcast (Lifestyle), and in 2022, Peoples was honored with the Pratt Fashion Visionary Award. In 2023, Peoples and writer Morgan Jerkins accepted the National Magazine Award for Single-Topic Issue for the package “Ten Years After Trayvon Martin.”\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 1 February 1973, 52-year-old Karuppan Velusamy, a one-armed jobless man, was brutally murdered while sleeping along a five-foot way street in Jalan Berseh, off Jalan Besar in Singapore. Velusamy's killer was not arrested until less than a week after his death, when 26-year-old labourer Ismail bin U. K. Abdul Rahman was caught as a suspect in killing Velusamy. Ismail, who earlier confessed to committing the murder due to a misunderstanding between him and the victim, denied in court that he was the perpetrator and put up a defence of alibi, claiming he was sleeping at his girlfriend's home at the time of the offence. After some deliberation, the High Court found Ismail guilty of murdering Velusamy and sentenced him to death, after rejecting his alibi defence and accepting both his confession and the evidence of two men who saw or heard Ismail killing Velusamy. In the aftermath, Ismail's appeals were dismissed, and he was hanged on 28 February 1975.\n\n\n== Murder investigation ==\nOn the morning of 1 February 1973, an elderly one-armed man was found dead at a PUB quarters in Jalan Berseh, off Jalan Besar in Singapore.The deceased old man, identified as 52-year-old Karuppan Velusamy, was first discovered at a five-foot way with several open wounds on his body, either caused by slashing or stabbing, and a bloodstain shaped like a palmprint was discovered nearby. Residents living nearby the area reportedly heard a commotion from the ground floor of the quarters at around 4am, and Velusamy's death was first reported five hours after the supposed commotion, which was likely an attack initiated on Velusamy's life. Velusamy's death was believed to be caused by a group of men armed with deadly weapons, based on speculations and theories that the police considered during investigations. Velusamy, whose wife and son were living in India, was jobless for many years and he spent at least ten years on social welfare financial schemes, and he lived with his relatives in Singapore. Velusamy was revealed to have lost his right arm due to a bombing during World War II. His relative Adimoolam Vadivelu also told the press that Velusamy was good to people around him and he never had any grudges with anyone.Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, a senior forensic pathologist, conducted a post-mortem examination (or autopsy) on Velusamy, and based on his autopsy findings, Professor Chao found that Velusamy sustained traumatic head injuries on his body, and two major fractures (measured 4 cm and 6 cm respectively) were located on the lower side of his skull, and another two skull fractures were inflicted below his right eye, and these injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.On 8 February 1973, a week after Velusamy was murdered, it was reported that the police arrested a suspect behind the murder at Serangoon Road, and he was thereafter held in remand while pending further investigations by the police. On that same day itself, another man was also apprehended for a separate murder case that had no relation to the Velusamy case.\n\n\n== Ismail's murder trial ==\nOn 8 October 1973, the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Ismail bin U. K. Abdul Rahman, was officially brought to trial at the High Court for murdering Karuppan Velusamy some six months back. G. Gopalan represented Ismail during the trial while the prosecution was led by Alan Wong, and the trial was presided by two veteran judges: Justice Frederick Arthur Chua (F A Chua) and Justice Tan Ah Tah.The trial court was told that due to a past misunderstanding that occurred between Ismail and the victim Velusamy, whom Ismail accidentally banged onto before it escalated into an argument between the two men, and due to the past dispute, Ismail had attacked Velusamy and therefore fatally assaulted him. In fact, in a statement dated 17 February 1973, which was written after he was arrested and charged for Velusamy's murder, Ismail had admitted to using a changkol to hack Velusamy three times on his head and hence battering him to death. During the stage of the prosecution's case, one of the prosecution's witnesses was Muthu Kamaru, who was sleeping nearby Velusamy at the time of the attack, and he witnessed Ismail attacking and assaulting Velusamy with a changkol, and Muthu alleged that Ismail threatened him in Tamil if he wanted to meet the same fate as Velusamy. Another key witness for the prosecution was Mohammed Micha, who testified that on the day of the murder, after the crime was committed, Ismail had admitted to him that he had beaten Velusamy and caused his death.On 12 October 1973, Ismail elected to put up his defence after the close of the prosecution's case. In his defence, Ismail claimed that he was sleeping at his girlfriend's home at Sam Leong Road, and he was never at the scene of crime, and he only read about the crime on the paper a day after it happened. Ismail also claimed his confession to Inspector Michael Won was not given voluntarily and the police investigator had threatened him to confess. The defence also tried to raise doubts over the validity of the testimonies given by the two key prosecution witnesses during the trial.On 15 October 1973, Justice Tan Ah Tah and Justice F A Chua delivered their verdict, with Justice Chua pronouncing the sentence in court. In the joint judgement, which was made 90 minutes after the stage of closing submissions, Justice Chua stated that they rejected Ismail's alibi defence and opted to accept that Ismail indeed killed Velusamy since he confessed to committing the murder in his cautioned statement, and there were also witnesses who knew about his involvement in the crime, one having witnessed Ismail at the scene of crime while the other hearing Ismail telling him that he killed Velusamy. Justice Chua also said that the judges were inclined to accept the prosecution's arguments that Ismail had mercilessly battered Velusamy to death and believe that Ismail's statement was truthful and voluntarily made, and they thus ruled that Ismail should be held fully culpable for the merciless slaying of Velusamy on that fateful day of 1 February 1973.As such, Ismail was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Prior to 2013, the death penalty was classified as the mandatory sentence for all four degrees of murder under the Singaporean Penal Code.As of February 1974, Ismail was one of 17 people held on death row in Changi Prison, and the number dropped to 15 by October 1974, with Ismail and the remaining 14 people convicted of murder still awaiting their executions.\n\n\n== Appeal process ==\nWhile he was incarcerated on death row at Changi Prison, Ismail appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence. His defence counsel R Murugason argued that there was barely any evidence against Ismail to prove the murder charge except for his cautioned statement in which he admitted to murdering Velusamy, and also raised a defence of alcohol intoxication on behalf of Ismail. On 25 April 1974, the Court of Appeal dismissed Ismail's appeal and upheld both his murder conviction and death sentence. The three appellate judges - Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin and two Supreme Court judges Choor Singh and A V Winslow - rejected the defence's arguments and they also cited that apart from Ismail's statement that he was drunk, the defence did not bring forward any other evidence to substantiate it.After losing his appeal, Ismail filed a motion for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council in London for a review of his case, and Queen's Counsel Dingle Foot argued on behalf of Ismail that his statements should not have been admitted and he raised doubts over the validity of the two prosecution witnesses who claimed to hear or saw Ismail killing Velusamy. However, on 5 December 1974, Ismail's application was rejected by the Privy Council, which dismissed the defence's case.As a final recourse to escape the gallows, Ismail petitioned to the President of Singapore for clemency, with hopes to commute his death sentence to life in prison. However, then President Benjamin Sheares rejected his final death row plea for clemency, and therefore confirmed the death penalty in Ismail's case.\n\n\n== Execution ==\nOn the Friday morning of 28 February 1975, 28-year-old Ismail bin U. K. Abdul Rahman was hanged in Changi Prison. Ismail was one of the eight criminals to be executed during that same morning; the remaining seven convicts were a pair of brothers Andrew Chou and David Chou, and another five youngsters who were all found guilty of murdering three gold smugglers to rob them of 120 gold bars in 1971. The case, known as the Gold Bars triple murders, was committed by the seven condemned and three other accomplices, two of whom were minors and thus imprisoned under the President's Pleasure rather than facing execution, and a third man turned state evidence against the nine others and therefore detained indefinitely without trial under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.Reportedly, over 200 friends and relatives, consisting of those of Ismail and the seven Gold Bar killers, gathered outside the jail to reclaim the bodies of the eight men, who were all put to death within 20 minutes; the first six of the eight men were hanged in batches of three before the remaining two were executed altogether. The State Coroner, several doctors and prison officers were present at the gallows when the eight men's death sentences were officially carried out.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Þóra Finnsdóttir (1408 – around 1460) was the prioress of the Benedictine convent named Reynistathir Abbey (Reynistaðarklaustur) in Iceland, serving since the death of the previous prioress, Þórunn Ormsdóttir. She became the abbess on August 25, 1437, when she was ordained by bishop of Skálholt Gozewijn Comhaer. An exemption had to be made for Þóra because she was only 29 years old when her predecessor died, and abbesses had to be at least 30 years old to be ordained.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nÞóra came from a wealthy family. Her parents were Finnur Gamlason, a lawyer in Ysta-Mói in Fljót, and his wife Valgerður Vilhjálmsdóttir. Her uncles were Jón Gamlason, abbot of Þingeyrar, and Marteinn Gamlason, county magistrate in Ketilsstaðir of Vellir.\nÞóra was one of the eight nuns who Jón Vilhjálmsson Craxton ordained at Hólar on February 4, 1431. Around the same time that she became prioress, the convent received a windfall. Margrét Bjarnadóttir, widow of the lawyer Hrafn Guðmundsson, joined the convent and brought a substantial amount of wealth. In addition, she gave land to the church of Hólar to lay to rest her husband, who was excommunicated when he died.\nIt iss likely that Þóra had taken the saint's name of Barbara when she was ordained because sources from the 1440s and 1450s refer to Barbara the Abbess but no sources mention her ordination or Þóra's death, so it seems that they are the same person. In fact, it is not entirely certain when Þóra/Barbara died. She was alive in 1459 but a new prioress, Agnes Jónsdóttir, had arrived by 1461.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"Reynistaðarklaustur\".

Early musicians were appeared MCs including Algorash, Mad Boys, Abyssinia Boys and Afaris. Furthermore, Teddy Yo and Lij Michael popularized this genre, becoming one of the most iconic rappers in the genre. \nEthiopian hip hop music often deals with social and political issues, hard work, youth culture and romantic relations, usually sung in Amharic language. Addis Ababa is considered the regional scene of the genre where many musician blossom. The hip hop genre has been criticized by many conservatives of \"disrupting the Ethiopian culture\". Indeed, many musicians compromise with Ethiopian music genres such as Kassmasse, who blends his music with Northern Ethiopia highland music tizita and ambassel.\n\n\n== History ==\nEthiopian hip hop music is relatively new phenomena emerged in early 2000s. Combining traditional music with modern one, the Ethiopian hip hop usually sung in Amharic language. Teddy Yo and Lij Michael often credited as the pioneer of the genre.  Addis Ababa is the regional and cultural scene of Ethiopian hip hop music with pioneering artists citing their influences such as Tupac, Eminem, Jay-Z and LL Cool J. Inspiring youth culture, the rapid growth of rap music often supposed to dismay among conservatives in the Ethiopian society and disrupt Ethiopian culture. Teddy Yo dismissed this claim by saying \"We didn’t steal hip hop from America,” he says. “It came up from our own culture.\" He noted that the old play of \"shilela\" and \"kererto\" could be combined into rap form before engaging to warfare in order to improvise \"essentially battle rap\".  \nLyrics of Ethiopian hip hop music often focus on theme of hard work and social and political issues such as poverty, materialism and education while other tracks value glamour of beautiful woman. Early pioneering MCs for this genre includes Algorash, Mad Boys, Abyssinia Boys and Afaris. Teddy described them \"basically, they just took the music from the US and made mixtapes.”  \nIn 2020s, the genre gained wide popularity due innovation of Kassmasse, bringing a unique style and perspective to the scene. He often mixed with  jazz, funk, soul and more prominently tizita and ambassel sounds. Jemberu Demeke is another example of this feature whose genre described as \"dynamic\" with \"youth optimism\" along his use of hip hop with traditional Ethiopian music such as jazz funk, and soul music. His debut album interpolated Mulatu Astatke, who was regarded as the \"father of Ethio-jazz\". \n\n\n== List of musicians ==\nTeddy Yo\nLij Michael\nMC Mike\nSkat Nati\nAmine\nNOS\nMC Siyameregn\nLola Monroe\nHahu Beats\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nancy Usero is a retired Spanish rhythmic gymnast, member of the national group. She was also national head coach from 1998 to 2001.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nUsero took up the sport at Escuela de Gimnasia Rítmica of Zaragoza. In 1982 she won bronze in the 2nd category of the Spanish Championships in Palencia. She became part of the Spanish national group, she would train at the Moscardó Gymnasium in Madrid under the orders of the national team coach Emilia Boneva and the group coach, Ana Roncero, Georgi Neykov was the team's choreographer. In 1984 she won the bronze medal in the all-around competition at the European Championships in Vienna along Pilar Domenech, María Fernández, Virginia Manzanera, Eva Obalat and Graciela Yanes, with Rocío Ducay and Ofelia Rodríguez as substitutes. After this achievement, they were all awarded the Medal of Gymnastic Merit of 1984 from the Royal Spanish Gymnastics Federation that was given to them in 1985 in a ceremony presided over by Alfonso de Borbón y Dampierre, Duke of Cádiz, then president of the COE.\nAt the 1985 World Championships in Valladolid the group was 7th in the All-Around along Pilar Domenech, Eva Obalat, Ofelia Rodríguez, María Fernández and Graciela Yanes, in addition to Ester Domínguez, Rocío Ducay, Laura Manzanera and Estela Martín as substitutes.\nAfter her retirement, she served as technical director of the Aragonese Gymnastics Federation and prepared gymnasts at her childhood club, eventually training Esther Domínguez from 1994 until she was called by the individuals national coach Mar Lozano.\nIn 1997, Nancy was selected as head of the national junior group. In September 1998, she was named national head coach for groups, replacing María Fernández Ostolaza. She had Dalia Kutkaite as assistant and coach of the junior group, and Cristina Álvarez as choreographer the first year. During 1999 and 2000, the two exercises were with 3 ribbons and 2 hoops and the one with 10 clubs, in the first they used \"Zorongo gitano\" and \"Babelia\" by Chano Domínguez, Hozan Yamamoto and Javier Paxariño for the second, as music during 1999. That year the group was made up of Sara Bayón, Marta Calamonte, Lorena Guréndez, Carolina Malchair, Beatriz Nogalez and Paula Orive. At the end of May at the European Championships in Budapest, they were 7th in the All-Around, due to a poor score in the 10 clubs exercise. In the 3 ribbons and 2 hoops competition they won the bronze medal. In August the team won the silver medal in the mixed event at the DTB-Pokal in Bochum. At the end of September at the World Championships in Osaka they were 7th overall competition, which gave them qualification for the Sydney Olympic Games the following year. Subsequently, they took 6th place in both event finals.\nIn 2000 they had two new routines, now with music by Los Activos and Vicente Amigo and, for the 10 clubs exercise, with a medley by The Corrs and Loreena McKennitt. The Spanish team, made up of Igone Arribas, Marta Calamonte, Lorena Guréndez, Carolina Malchair, Beatriz Nogalez and Carmina Verdú, had the opportunity to revalidate the gold medal won four years before in Atlanta in the same competition. However, a series of errors in the execution of the two exercises, such as a knot in a ribbon and two falls of clubs, caused the Spanish group to be placed in the 10th and last position in the qualification phase, therefore who could not participate in the final.\nIn October 2000 Nancy Usero was renewed as head coach, position she would keep until March 2001, date on which she was replaced by Nina Vitrichenko, who would be the head coach between March and September of that year.\nAfter Boneva's death on 20 September 2019, Nancy and other former national gymnasts gathered to pay tribute to her during the Euskalgym held on 16 November 2019. The event took place before 8,500 attendees at the Bilbao Exhibition Center de Baracaldo and was followed by a dinner in Boneva's honor.\n\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\nThe bronze medal at the European Championships in Vienna in 1984 was the first for the Spanish group since 1975, and then began a long period of winning international medals. In an interview in 2016, María Fernández highlighted the importance of that medal for Spanish rhythmic gymnastics:\n\nAt that time, what we wanted was to overthrow the Eastern countries [...] As the medals were always Russia, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, ours was a great milestone and the bronze in the European Championship was indeed a feat for the team . It was the start of something.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John F. Boyle Jr., a former doctor from Mansfield, Ohio, was convicted for the murder of his wife Noreen in 1989. His case became highly publicized due to the nature of the crime, where he suffocated his wife and then entombed her body inside a home he owned in Erie, Pennsylvania. Despite the gruesome nature of his crime, Boyle's children have expressed support for his parole. However, Noreen Boyle's family has argued against it.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\n\n== The crime ==\nDr. John Boyle was convicted in a highly publicized trial for the murder of his wife, Noreen, on December 31, 1989. Their son, Landry, and daughter, Elizabeth, provided key insights; Landry recounted a scream and thump he heard, while Elizabeth, only three, described seeing her father hit her mother. Noreen's body was found under the basement of a new home in Erie, Pennsylvania, in January 1990, following a lead from the children's accounts.\n\n\n== Investigation and arrest ==\nThe investigation into Noreen Boyle's disappearance began when her friends alerted police, leading to the discovery of her body under the basement of John Boyle's new Erie home in January 1990. Key testimony came from their children, especially son Collier. Boyle was arrested, and during the trial, evidence such as the rental of a jackhammer used to bury Noreen's body was crucial. Boyle's conviction followed, highlighting a meticulously planned crime that shocked the community.\n\n\n== Trial ==\n\n\n== Conviction and incarceration ==\nDr. John F. Boyle Jr. is currently incarcerated at the Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, Ohio.\n\n\n== Appeal ==\nJune 2, 1994, Dr. John F. Boyle Jr., serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife, Noreen, appealed for habeas corpus relief, citing insufficient evidence, denial of corpse examination by defense experts, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the district court's denial of the writ, finding the evidence sufficient and the claims of trial and prosecutorial errors unfounded, thereby upholding Boyle's conviction.\n\n\n== Parole hearings ==\nDecember 6, 2010: The Parole Board denied parole for Boyle's first hearing stating, \"Release at this time would not further the interest of justice and would demean the seriousness of the brutal crime.\"\nDecember 2, 2020: The Parole Board denied parole for Boyle's second hearing stating, \"There is substantial reason to believe that due to the serious nature of the crime, the release of the inmate into society would create undue risk to the public safety, or that due to the serious nature of the crime, the release of the inmate would not further the interest of justice or be consistent with the welfare and security of society.\"\nOctober 1, 2025: Parole Board hearing scheduled.\n\n\n== Impact on community and media coverage ==\nThe John Boyle trial captivated Mansfield, Ohio, becoming a significant part of local history. It drew extensive media coverage, akin to a soap opera, with the community closely following each development. This attention reflected the trial's impact on the collective consciousness and discussions within Mansfield, underscoring the profound effect of high-profile legal cases on small communities.\n\n\n=== \"A Murder in Mansfield\" ===\n\"A Murder in Mansfield\" is a documentary that centers on Collier Landry, who grapples with the aftermath of his mother Noreen Boyle's murder by his father, Dr. John Boyle. The film chronicles Landry's journey of confronting his past, his testimony against his father, and his quest for healing and understanding. Through Landry's personal story, the documentary addresses broader themes of justice, the impact of crime on families, and the path to forgiveness.\n\n\n=== \"Moving Past Murder\" ===\n\"Moving Past Murder\" is a podcast created by Collier Landry that delves into his experiences following the murder of his mother, Noreen Boyle, by his father, Dr. John Boyle, in 1989. The podcast serves as both a personal therapeutic journey for Landry and a support platform for listeners navigating similar traumas, emphasizing resilience and the process of healing from profound betrayal.\n\n\n== Later developments ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Puy Griou is a summit at an altitude of 1,690 meters in the Mounts of Cantal, located on the ridge line between the valleys of the Cère and the Jordanne, partially situated in the municipalities of Saint-Jacques-des-Blats and Mandailles.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe summit is called \"Puei Griu\" in Aurillac Occitan. In this dialect, griu comes from griea, which means \"difficult to climb.\" In the Occitan auvergnat spoken further north of the mountain, it is called Puei de Grion.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nDue to its position in the center of the Monts du Cantal and its very slender conical shape, Puy Griou was long considered to be the eroded chimney of the Cantal volcano. However, it has since lost this status, and geologists now consider it to be a phonolite dome occupying a central position similar to other peaks in the massif such as Roc d'Hozières. It is believed to have formed approximately 6 million years ago, following the paroxysmal eruptive phases experienced by the Cantal between 8.5 Ma and 6.5 Ma. During the cold periods of the recent Quaternary, repeated freeze-thaw cycles fractured the rock into slabs, forming a scree mantle.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe GR 400 follows the ridge line between the Col du Pertus and the Col de Rombière, near the ski resort of Le Lioran. At the foot of the dome, a trail veers southward, allowing for the ascent of the final 200 meters of elevation gain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "King is a restaurant in the South Village neighborhood of Manhattan, in New York City. King opened in September 2016. King serves French and Italian food.\n\n\n== History ==\nJess Shadbolt, Claire de Boer, and Annie Shi founded and own King. Shadbolt and de Boer met while they both worked at The River Café in London, and later met Shi, who was then working at The Clove Club. Before opening King, Shi and de Boer managed a \"supper club\" together, first in London and then in New York. The restaurant's interior was designed by de Boer's mother. King's operators originally searched for a space in Chinatown. King opened in September 2016, in a location previously occupied by the restaurant Mekong.de Boer has compared the challenges of operating her upstate New York restaurant, Stissing House, to the challenges associated with operating King, saying that King has \"no room\" but a large number of potential diners, while Stissing House has \"loads of room\" and a much smaller pool of potential diners.Shadbolt, de Boer, and Shi opened a second restaurant, Jupiter, in 2022.\n\n\n== Menu and offerings ==\nThe menu at King changes daily, and staff determines what the restaurant will serve each morning. Many dishes do not contain protein, focusing instead on vegetables. Shadbolt, de Boer, and Shi have said they source ingredients from Union Square Market. The restaurant consistently features panisse on its menu, which de Boer attributed partially to the fact that the staff enjoys eating it with \"a cold drink\".\n\n\n== Reviews and accolades ==\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\nShauna Lyon, in a review published by The New Yorker, praised the restaurant's service and food.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nJordana Rothman, writing for Food & Wine, included Shadbolt and de Boer on her 2018 list of the best new chefs in the United States. de Boer was nominated for the 2018 James Beard Award for \"Rising Star Chef of the Year\".Pete Wells, the restaurant critic for the New York Times, included King on his 2023 and 2024 lists of the one hundred best restaurants in New York City. Wells emphasized King's interpretation of French and Italian cooking as his reason for including the restaurant on the lists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Alfred \"Red\" Barr (August 14, 1908 – June 12, 1971) was an American Hall of Fame swim coach for Southern Methodist University (SMU).  He coached the Southern Methodist swimming team for twenty-four years from 1947 through 1971, where he led the Mustangs to seventeen Southwestern Conference Championships, including fifteen consecutive championships from 1957 through 1971.Barr was born on August 14, 1908, to Bertha May Walker and William James Barr in the small community of Avon, Ohio, outside Cleveland, where he attended Avon High School and graduated in 1926.  Demonstrating a high level of academic achievement, he was the valedictorian of his High School class.He attended Oberlin College, graduating in 1930 with an A.B. degree.  Though he was not involved in competitive swimming, he lettered in the sports of both basketball and baseball, captaining Oberlin College's 1929-30 basketball team, and playing third-base on the 1930 baseball team. He received a master's degree from New York University in 1937.\n\n\n== Naval service ==\nAfter coaching Track and Swimming at Connellsville High School, in the greater Pittsburgh area, Barr began in the US v-5 Naval Program in November, 1942, and remained in the service through Feb. 1, 1946 primarily with the rank of Lieutenant.  While coaching at SMU, he remained in the Naval reserve until 1963, reaching the rank of Commander.  Barr served as an Assistant Physical Instructor during his early years with the Navy in Athens, Georgia, and his responsibilities included teaching swimming techniques to naval flight cadets.  While in the Navy in the early 1940's, Barr served under Matty Bell, a Hall of Fame S.M.U. football coach, at the Georgia Pre‐Flight School, and Bell later helped in the process of bringing Mr. Barr to S.M.U. in 1946.  After his high school coaching stint and service in the US Navy, Barr returned to Ohio in Spring, 1946 where he married Philadelphia's Helen Paula Cleaver, whom he met during his Naval service.\n\n\n== Coaching ==\n\n\n=== Connellsville High ===\nAfter completing Oberlin College, he taught Physical Education while coaching at Connellsville High School for 12 years from 1930-1942.  The School is now known as the Connellsville Area High School in Connellsville, Pennsylvania.  His Coaching career began at Connellsville in 1930 as an Assistant Football Coach, and he also coached field events for the Track Team, and served as a trainer for the basketball team during his twelve-year tenure at the school.Beginning in 1936, when it first became a varsity sport, he coached swimming at Connellsville, with considerable success, winning the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) Championships five times between 1938 and 1942. In their WPIAL championship win in 1939, the team set an all time WPIAL league scoring high mark with 49 points.  An outstanding swimmer in 1942 included Harold Stefl, 200-yard freestyle champion.  Another 1942 standout swimmer was Bob Munson, who set a school record in the 100-yard backstroke of 1:05.6 when the team won their fifth WPIAL championship that year.  One of Barr's outstanding swimmers was Grant Buttermore, who swam a state record 100-yard breast stroke time of 1:12.6 at the WPIAL Meet in Pittsburgh in February, 1941, leading Connellsville to their fourth consecutive WPIAL championship. Outstanding swimmers in 1942 included record holder in breaststroke James Dwire, and Harold Stefl, 200-yard freestyle champion.  The team's 1942 WPIAL championship win was close, with Vandergrift High School's swim team coming within seven points of Connellsville's 49 point total.  The team also performed well in the 1943 WPIAL championship under new interim coach W.L. Lewis with most of Barr's former swimmers in competition. During one period near the end of Barr's tenure, Barr's Connellsville swim team won 40 consecutive dual meets. In the 1956-7 season Connellville dropped varsity swimming as a sport, but resumed WPIAL swimming in the 1970-71 season.\n\n\n=== SMU coach ===\nAfter completing his successful high school swim coaching career, and active Naval service, Barr was SMU Head Coach from 1947 to 1971, where he led his teams to 17 Southwestern Conference Championships, the most of any coach in the conference to that date.  Fifty of Barr's swimmers and divers received All-American honors, and as outstanding swimmers they led SMU to finish in the top 10 in the NCAA eight times in Barr's tenure as coach between 1962 and 1971, his last nine years. He coached the US men's swimming team to a win at the Pan Am games in 1963.  Olympic swimmers he coached included Doug Russell and Ronnie Mills.  Barr also coached Richard Quick, an SMU Team Captain in his Senior Year around 1965, and a 400-IM medley winner in a Southwestern Conference Championship.  Quick would go on to an exceptional career as both an Olympic Coach and University of Texas and Stanford women's coach, leading his two women's teams to twelve NCAA championships, after serving as an SMU Assistant Coach from 1971 through 1975 under Barr's successor, SMU Hall of Fame Head Coach George McMillion.In his last ten years of coaching, Barr's SMU teams lost only two meets in dual competition, and while dominating their region won 15 consecutive Southwestern Conference Championships from 1957 through 1971.  At one point in his career, Coach Barr's SMU swim teams had 75 consecutive dual meet wins.In 1966, Barr along with Walter Kaspareit started the Junior Mustang Swim Team.  An outstanding youth program, by the late 60's, the team would begin to send a few of its swimmers to the Olympic trials every four years.  The Junior Mustangs would be later known as the Dallas Swim Club, under Coach Richard Quick in 1971, and would practice at both the SMU pools and the Highland Park High School pool.\n\n\n== Service to the swimming community ==\nBarr was Chair of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) swimming rules committee, served on the committee for the Pan American Games for swimming, and significantly served as a Chairman of the Southwestern Amateur Athletic Union swimming committee from 1950 through 1971, and as President from 1969 through 1971.  He managed the 1958 Women's AAU Indoor Championships, the 1960 NCAA Championships, the National Indoor AAU meet in 1967, and the February 1971 National AAU Championships at Loos Pool in Dallas.  He conducted swim clinics in South Africa in 1969 and in Israel in October 1970.Barr died of a heart attack around 6:30 AM on the morning of June 12, 1971 in the company of his wife Paula, at a hotel in El Paso, Texas while in town to coach a Junior Olympic meet for the Dr. Pepper Swim Club of Dallas.  He was 62.  He had had a prior heart attack in July 1963 but returned to coaching.  He was replaced by George McMillion, who had been one of his swimmers at SMU and had served as one of Barr's Assistant Coaches.  Barr was survived by his wife Paula, two sons and two daughters.  His sons both swam for the SMU team.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nHe was inducted into the SMU Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011, the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame in 2013, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1975 and the Texas Swimming & Diving  Halls of Fame in 2008.  Late in his career, Barr received the Big D Award of the All-Sports Association of Dallas in 1971.  After Barr's death, SMU named its new outdoor Olympic size 50-meter pool, the Red Barr Pool, which included a diving well in his honor.  The pool has since been replaced by the new Robson & Lindley Aquatics Center and the Barr-McMillion Natatorium, whose name honors both Barr's legacy and that of George McMillion, the SMU coach that succeeded him.\n.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame, Red Barr\nSMU Athletic Hall of Fame, Red Barr",

        "content": "Boikanyo Ramathlakwane Komane (born 28 November 1992) is a South African soccer player who plays as a defensive midfielder for Richards Bay in the Premier Soccer League.\nFollowing stints at United and Royal Eagles, he spent one and a half season in Thanda Royal Zulu. In 2017, Thanda Royal Zulu sold their league license to AmaZulu and wrapped up their operation. Both Royal Eagles and Richards Bay claimed to sign the player. A DRC tribunal ruled in favour of Royal Eagles.\nKomane went on to Chippa United in 2018 and was a regular in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 South African Premier Division. Sports magazine wrote about Komane as a possible replacement for Kaizer Chiefs's Willard Katsande or SuperSport United's Dean Furman. However, he went to the Lamontville Golden Arrows and only played one match during a two-year stay. A good year in the First Division with All Stars earned him a move back to the Premier Division in summer 2023, signing for Richards Bay.\n\n\n== References ==",

Adapted from his own semi-autobiographical stage play of the same name, the film stars Olson as a fictionalized version of himself, a bisexual actor who goes on a difficult emotional journey toward self-acceptance after suffering a relapse in his prior struggle with an eating disorder.\nThe cast also includes Koumbie, Sam Vigneault, Josh MacDonald, Oliver Boyle, Jessica Barry, Thom Payne, Jeremy Smith, Matthew Lumley, Frietzen Kenter, Varun Guru, Emily Jewer, Beth Amiro, David Light, Kathleen Dorian, Peter Sarty, Richie Wilcox and Stephanie MacDonald in supporting roles.\nOlson has called the film a \"fictional autobiography\", clarifying that while the film is based on his own personal experiences, some parts of it were fictionalized for the purposes of making the story more dramatically compelling. His original play was a one-man show, with the other characters added for the film.\nThe film premiered at the 2024 Slamdance Film Festival. It had its Canadian premiere at the Canadian Film Festival, where Olson won the award for Best Performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLook at Me at IMDb",

        "content": "Inglasco Inc. is a Canadian manufacturer of hockey pucks that has operated since 1976. Styled originally as InGlasCo, the company was founded in Sherbrooke, Quebec, by Denis S. Drolet (1951–2023), the son of Sherwood Hockey founder Léo Paul Drolet (1919–2001). Inglasco was created as a fibreglass manufacturing company, and in 1980 entered the hockey business. Since 1991, Inglasco has been the official puck supplier of the National Hockey League, although its pucks have been used in the league since the early 1980s. Along with pucks, the company produces water bottles, mini sticks, hockey bags, and novelties.\nBetween 1994 and 2008, Denis Drolet's holding company, the Groupe Drolet Inc., owned Inglasco and Sherwood-Drolet. After Sherwood-Drolet went bankrupt in 2008, Carpe Diem Growth Capital acquired it and Inglasco. In 2014, the Gracious Living Corporation acquired Sherwood and Inglasco from Carpe Diem. Gracious Living sold Sherwood in 2018, but retained ownership of Inglasco. The company is based in the original Sherwood factory in Sherbrooke.\n\n\n== History ==\nInGlasCo was founded in 1976 by Denis S. Drolet as a die-cut fibreglass company. The name is a portmanteau of \"industrial glass fibre components.\" In 1980, the company entered the hockey puck business. While Inglasco designed and marketed its pucks, it contracted out the manufacturing. Its main contractors were Vegum a.s. in Dolné Vestenice, Slovakia, and Soucy Barron Inc. in St-Jerome, Quebec. The company hired ex-NHL player Sean McKenna as vice-president for sales and marketing.\nPrior to 1991–92 NHL season, individual teams were responsible for providing pucks for their home games. As long as its pucks met the league's physical specifications, a team could use any puck it wished. For the 1991–92 season, the league's 75th anniversary, the NHL's manager of retail and licensing, Fred Scalera, decided the league should have an official puck. Scalera polled teams on which puck they wanted, and the overwhelming choice was Inglasco. He said, \"it seemed to make a lot of sense on the marketing side to have an official puck. There's an official baseball, an official football and, now, an official puck.\" Although most teams were already using Inglasco, some used Viceroy pucks also.\nAfter a fire at his factory in 1969, in 1970 Léo Drolet sold a majority stake in Sherwood-Drolet to Figgie International of Cleveland. In late 1994, Denis Drolet formed the Groupe Drolet Inc. and reacquired Sherwood-Drolet from Figgie. After the acquisition, Drolet placed Inglasco's operations within the Groupe Drolet as well.\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Inglasco laid off around 25 of its 40 employees. However, during the summer of 2005, it was able to rehire all its employees.\nIn May 2008, the Sherwood-Drolet Corp. filed for bankruptcy, and a month later its assets were acquired by Carpe Diem Growth Capital. That September, the reorganised Sher-Wood company, owned by Carpe Diem, acquired Inglasco. In 2014, the Gracious Living Corporation, a plastic injection furniture manufacturer based in Woodbridge, Ontario, acquired Sherwood and Inglasco from Carpe Diem. In 2018, Gracious Living sold the Sherwood trademarks to the Canadian Tire Corporation while retaining ownership of Inglasco.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hannah Louise Wessling (May 26, 1873 – January 18, 1960) was an American chemist, billed as \"Uncle Sam's Bread Maker\" during World War I.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWessling was from Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of John Henry Wessling and Mary Dorothea Rabbe Wessling. Her father and her maternal grandparents were born in Germany. She graduated from Woodward High School in 1894.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWessling taught chemistry in Cincinnati as a young woman. In the 1910s and 1920s, Wessling worked for the United States Department of Agriculture in Chicago and later in Washington, D.C. She was a food scientist, testing flours and creating optimal recipes and equipment for home baking, using alternative ingredients or varying pan sizes. \"Miss Wessling has devoted considerable time--thirteen years--in the work of making bread, jellies, preserves, and canning fruit, and later analyzing them as a chemist,\" explained one 1910 newspaper report. Her work took on particular relevance during World War I, when food conservation required some substitutions in traditional recipes, and working women sought more efficient and economical ways to bake.\nWessling was a home economist for the Northwest Yeast Company from 1922 into the 1940s. She spoke at the American Home Economics Association meeting in Buffalo in 1924.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Use of Wheat Flour Substitutes in Baking\" (1918)\n\"The Chemical Analysis of Wheat-flour Substitutes and of the Breads Made Therefrom\" (1920, with Joseph Arthur Le Clerc)\nBaking in the Home (1921)\n\"Home-Breadmaking is Simple\" (1931)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWessling lived in California in her later years. She died in 1960, at the age of 86.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Moiramora Doul or Moiramora Than is a historical site in India located at Khamtighat in Mancotta Mouza of Dibrugarh district. Presently, only the ruins of the Moiramora Doul or Than have been discovered. Now, Moiramora Satra is situated at the site of the ruins. The Moiramora Ruins are situated on the bank of the Dihing at Khamtighat. The site features stone sculptures of various postures and attitudes dating back to the early and late medieval period, characterized by native ethnic texture. The Archaeological Department of the Government of Assam has recognized the Moiramora Doul as a State Protected Monument.\n\n\n== History ==\nBor Jadumoni, a prominent disciple of Gopal Ata, the founder of the Kaal-Sanghati Satra of Ekasarana Dharma\nintroduced by Srimanta Sankardeva and Sri Sri Madhavdeva, founded the Moiramora Satra at Kalaulwa on the banks of the Burhi Dihing River. The Ahom king Sujinphaa (1675-77 AD) and the Premier Atan Burhagohain converted to Nam Dharma and became disciples of the Moiramora Satra. The daul and pond of the satra were dug and dedicated under the patronage of the Ahoms. The earthquake caused the foundation of the daul of Moiramora Satra to collapse due to floods and erosion of the Burhi Dihing.\nThe satra was damaged by natural disasters and later became uninhabited due to internal uprisings in the Ahom kingdom and the third invasion of the Burmese. Later, the Moiramora Satra was established at Kujibali in Hahchara Mouza of Sivasagar district. Subsequently, the Budhidihing River changed its course, deviating from the area where the satra daul was located and taking a straight course to the north of the satra. Later, new settlers discovered the ruins of the Moiramora Satra in the jungle and built a \"Than Ghar\" for worship. The family of the satradhikar of the satra arrived later and established a satra here again, continuing the responsibility of spreading Nam Dharma.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe area is currently being conserved and enhanced by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Assam under a scheme initiated in 2010. The archaeological department, along with the Dibrugarh district administration and local youth organizations, has constructed a fence, a concrete museum, and an altar covering around 7 bighas of land. Within the site, there are 13 rock-cut idols and fragments of several idols preserved in the gardens and local galleries of the Moiramora Than archaeological site. Excavations conducted in 2018 revealed evidence of two different periods of cultural civilization. The museum showcases altars of ancient temples made of bricks, copper coins from the British era, silver flowers, stone sculptures, and clay bricks of various shapes. Notably, the granite stone sculptures found here date back to the 8th to 9th centuries CE, while the sandstone sculptures are relatively more recent.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Moiramora Daul is situated on the banks of the Burhidihing River, approximately two kilometers west of Khamati Ghat in Mancotta Mouza of Dibrugarh district. It is well connected to Dibrugarh city, with the Dibrugarh railway station around 20 km away and the Dibrugarh Airport about 27 km away. The Moiramora Satra is situated in the former Langeri Mouza, which is now known as \"Jakai Napam Than Gaon.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Shutdown of ERT took place in Greece from June 11 until November 7, 2013. The ND/PASOK/DIMAR coalition government closed the then public broadcaster as part of its transformation to New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT). The decision was very controversial, and caused national and international outrage, and caused Democratic Left to leave the government. The majority of fired employees continued to broadcast from the headquarters of ERT, while after their expulsion from the Radiomegaron, a minority continued broadcasting through ΕRT Open while others took part in the new public broadcaster, NERIT.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nOn June 11, 2013, Minister for the Press and Mass Media and Government Spokesperson Simos Kedikoglou announced that by midnight of the same day, ERT would shut down and that its 2.656 employees would be laid-off. According to his statements, after a short but undefined period of time, a new public broadcaster with a staff of less than 1,000 people would begin operating.\nERT was dissolved by a joint ministerial decision issued under Article 14B of the Law 3429/2005 (on the dissolution, merger and restructuring of public enterprises) as amended by an Act of Legislative Content (Government Gazette 139/11.6.2013, Issue A'). Despite the existence of a budget surplus thanks to the contribution fee, Kedikoglou described ERT as a \"waste shelter\" that cost more and had fewer viewers than private media.\nShortly before dawn on June 12, the transmission of the signal from the broadcasting antennas throughout Greece was interrupted by the intervention of the MAT on some transmitters. Το αναλογικό σήμα διεκόπη στις 22:54, το ψηφιακό στις 23:12 και το ραδιοφωνικό στις 23:22. At the same time, the signal of other TV channels using the same transponders was cut off. Using satellite services, some offices and other places that had not yet been closed, ERT journalists continued their broadcasts online.\nIn turn, the state, which had already directly assumed the management of ERT, requested the suspension of the retransmission of ERT's television programming by television stations and internet providers on the grounds that it was not legal and licensed.\nOn June 12, the official websites ert.gr, ert3.gr and voiceofgreece.gr were removed from the Greek online register. Other assets and websites registered by ERT were in danger of being shut down (because the managers decided to cancel and change the contact address), in particular the official Facebook and Twitter pages. ERT Live began broadcasting on other websites and blogs.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe closure of ERT triggered a wave of protests and reactions throughout Greece, with citizens gathering outside the ERT Radiomegaron in a show of support and solidarity throughout the evening, while the ESIEA, the GSEE and ADEDY went on a 24-hour strike. A wave of reactions was also caused abroad with the beginning of the television coverage of the events at the Mesogeion Avenue Radiomegaron by foreign television networks. The EBU was quick to criticise the closure of ERT, issuing a statement expressing \"deep disappointment on behalf of the entire public media in Europe\" and calling on Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to reverse the decision.\nOn June 12, the Belgian channel \"Télé Bruxelles\" (now \"BX1\") broadcast the ERT logo with the word \"Solidarité\" meaning \"solidarity\" underneath.\nDespite the announcement of the closure, the majority of ERT employees remained at their workplaces. After the closure of the transmitters and the website, broadcasting continued via satellite with EBU equipment. The EBU also allocated a frequency for the live streaming of ERT's broadcast on the internet. In addition, ERT employees reopened the analogue transmitters in most areas of Greece in order to continue broadcasting its programme.\nOn 21 June 2013, the Democratic Left, the then third government partner, withdrew from the ND-PASOK coalition, citing as a reason the way the government chose to reorganise public broadcasting.\n\n\n=== Council of State decision and creation of Dimosia Tileorasi ===\nOn June 12, 2013, the government announced the entity that would replace ERT, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT). Five days later, the Council of State ruled that the closure of ERT was legal but at the same time demanded the continued operation of a public broadcaster for the period until the establishment and operation of a new broadcaster. In order not to reopen ERT, the government created a temporary body, Dimosia Tileorasi, which was under the Ministry of Finance, which had undertaken the management of ERT's assets and liquidation. The broadcaster began its experimental operation on July 10.\n\n\n=== POSPERT appeal to the European Court of Justice ===\nIn April 2018, the European Court of Human Rights accepted and examined the application of POSPERT, which, among other things, argued that \"the total closure of a public service broadcaster amounts to a violation of freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the ECHR\".\n\n\n== Continued broadcasting and evacuation of the Radiomegaron ==\nThe majority of the workers refused to leave the ERT building and continued broadcasting their radio, and television broadcasts as well as through the internet. On 24 October 2013 the EBU stopped transmitting ERT's programme via its satellites, which affected terrestrial broadcasting in some parts of Greece. At dawn on Thursday 7 November 2013, riot police and in the presence of a prosecutor entered the Agia Paraskevi Radiomegaron, evacuated it and arrested four employees. In this way, they put an end to five months of radio and television broadcasting from the Radiomegaron. This was followed by clashes and limited use of tear gas outside the building where people gathered after a call by the workers.\nA minority of ERT employees continued to broadcast programmes through the ERT Open project, which continued television broadcasts from ET3's frequencies and radio broadcasts from various regions of Greece.\n\n\n== Re-opening of ERT ==\nThe SYRIZA and the ANEL, the two parties that formed the coalition government that emerged from the elections of January 2015 had in their programme the reopening of ERT. On 28 April 2015, the relevant bill was passed by a majority vote which provided for the reopening of all ERT's television and radio stations and the Radiotelevision magazine, with a maximum planned staff of 2,500 employees.\nSo ERT came back together with the channels: ERT1, ERT2 and ERT HD and the radio stations: Proto, Second and Third Programme, Kosmos 93.6, ERA Sport, Voice of Greece, ERT3's radio station Macedonia (102 FM, 95.8 FM) and its 19 regional radio stations on 11 June 2015 with a renewed programme, 95.8 FM).\nERT's third channel, ERT3, which did not stop broadcasting from the day of the operator's closure, reappeared on ERT's nationwide frequencies with a new programme on 29 June 2015. On 12 October 2017, the Radiotelevision magazine was re-released. The radio programmes Filia 106.7, Trito Programma Vrahea and the foreign language programmes of the Voice of Greece did not resume. On 5 March 2018, the ERT building at the corner of Muroouzi and Rigillis streets was reopened and fully reopened.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Espresso\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sabrina Carpenter. It was released as a single on April 12, 2024, through Island Records. She wrote the song along with Amy Allen, Steph Jones, and Julian Bunetta, with the latter producing it. A Dave Meyers-directed music video for \"Espresso\" was released on the following day. Carpenter performed the song at the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn January 16, 2024, Sabrina Carpenter was confirmed as part of the American festival Coachella, held in Indio, California. She teased a new song, ahead of her performance at the festival, via billboards that read: \"She's gonna make you come... to her Coachella set!\". Carpenter announced the release of \"Espresso\" on her social media accounts on April 8, 2024, along with its release date and cover artwork. She captioned the post with: \"Just wanted to put out a little song before Coachella\". Island Records released the single via streaming and digital download, while Polydor Records released it through vinyl and cassette formats.\n\n\n== Writing and composition ==\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Carpenter confirmed that she wrote the song in France in a \"very quick process\", and that inspired \"how the song ended up feeling\". The lyrics of the song are about self-confidence. Speaking to American magazine Vogue, she stated that the song is about \"seeing femininity as your super power and embracing the confidence of being 'that bitch'\". Music journalists described the song's genre as pop, with elements of synthpop, disco, and funk.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nAn accompanying music video for \"Espresso\" was released on April 12, 2024, one day after the song. It was directed by Dave Meyers. About the video, Carpenter expressed: \"Since the day I heard the song, I saw a beach atmosphere—and more specifically this kind of old school [and] modern environment. [I wanted to capture] the playfulness that I like to use throughout all of my videos. I also just wanted a pool car, to be frank\".\nThe video begins with Sabrina and another man in a speedboat. As the man leans close behind Sabrina, she makes a sharp turn that leads to him falling out of the boat. She retrieves his wallet and pulls his gold credit card out of it, and as she makes land, she meets with some other girls and engages in various activities such as reading a book, receiving massages and pedicures, and sunbathing while being fanned by leaves. Right before the second verse, another vintage car shows up with a bunch of other men, who hold up a surfboard that she dances on top of. They continue to party together, and the car is eventually filled with water as Sabrina and one of the men lounge in it like a hot tub. However, she is then spotted by the man at the beginning of the video along with the police, who apprehend Sabrina and recover the man's wallet and gold credit card. She waves goodbye before being shoved into the cop car, which the police officer cannot start up. Music plays from the horn on top of the car, presumably setting a cliffhanger for a future track.\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nCarpenter performed \"Espresso\" live for the first time at the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, held on April 12.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n7-inch / cassette\nSide A\n\n\"Espresso\"\nSide B\n\n\"Espresso\" (On Vacation)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Widjiatno Notomihardjo (30 December 1940 – 23 July 2000) was an Indonesian businessman, best known for being the father of seventh President of Indonesia Joko Widodo. He was a successful wood merchant in Surakarta, who shortly prior to his death had begun to enter politics through the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNotomihardjo was born on 30 December 1940 in the village of Kragan, in what is today Karanganyar Regency of Central Java. He was the son of Lamidi Wirjo Mihardjo, who was the lurah (village chief) of his home village. Mihardjo married thrice, and Notomihardjo was born from his first wife. Mihardjo's father, Mangun Dinomo, was also a lurah at a different village in Boyolali. Notomihardjo studied until high school, and on 23 August 1959, at the age of 19, he married Sudjiatmi. Sudjiatmi was 16 at the time.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter marrying Sudjiatmi, Notomihardjo moved to Surakarta. Sudjiatmi's father Wirorejo worked in the lumber trade, and helped Notomihardjo in starting his own business, CV Roda Jati. The couple also traded in bamboo. During their time in Surakarta, Notomihardjo and Sudjiatmi had four surviving children: Joko Widodo, Iit Sriyantini, Ida Yati, and Titik Relawati, in addition to a stillborn son, Joko Lukito. As there were few competitors in Surakarta trading in teak wood, Notomihardjo's business gradually expanded, sourcing wood from more remote areas. During the purges against the Indonesian Communist Party, although Surakarta was heavily impacted, Notomihardjo was not arrested or investigated as he lacked any connection to the Indonesian Communist Party. Several of his neighbors, however, were arrested by soldiers.\nIn the 1970s, Notomihardjo along with his family were displaced from their home by a market and bus terminal expansion project. He moved to a new house, and his workshop along with him. Later on, Sudjiatmi handled more of the day-to-day aspects of the business, while Notomihardjo focused on sourcing raw materials. Following the fall of Suharto in 1998, Notomihardjo began to participate in politics, joining the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle and becoming a local party official in Surakarta under the leadership of F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo. \n\n\n== Death and burial ==\nNotomihardjo died on 23 July 2000 in Jakarta. He had been suffering from hernia, and intended to go to Singapore for a surgery, but passed away while at a hospital in Jakarta. He was buried in Gondangrejo village, Karanganyar, at Sudjiatmi's family burial site. His funeral drew large crowds in Surakarta.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuring his youth, Notomihardjo owned a Birmingham Small Arms motorbike, which he was known for riding around in his home village. He was also a fan of kroncong music, which, according to a family housekeeper, he had requested on his deathbed. He also sponsored a kroncong group in Surakarta.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hmong Cultural Center Museum, situated in Saint Paul, Minnesota, is an institution operated by the Hmong Cultural Center dedicated to preserving and promoting the heritage, history, and experiences of the Hmong people. It is one of the few museums in the US dedicated to this specific culture. \n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Twin Cities has the highest concentration of Hmong residents in America, with over 70,000 individuals belonging to this community, predominantly residing in and around St. Paul. The museum is part of a larger organization, the Hmong Cultural Center, which was established in 1998. The museum originally operated out of three rooms in the Cultural Center on the second floor of the office building it was not until 2021 that a formal museum space was launched in a storefront in the same building to for more space and better accessibility serve school and other groups coming in to view the exhibits. Vandalism to the storefront delayed the museum's grand opening by several weeks. In the early morning hours of September 8, 2021 vandals spray-painted the museum's storefront with white paint, obscuring existing messages about Black Lives Matter and poetry. They also stenciled, \"Life, Liberty, Victory,\" a slogan affiliated with the fascist white supremacist group Patriot Front on a window. Surveillance footage captured images of three people believed to be involved in the vandalism. The incident sparked outrage and community support. Donations from individuals and corporations helped cover most of the repair and security costs.\n\n\n== Exhibits and Displays ==\nThe museum's core mission revolves around fostering public understanding and appreciation for Hmong traditions, history, and ongoing contributions to American society which it achieves this through curated collection of exhibits that incorporate interactive elements to engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds. These exhibits delve into various aspects of Hmong culture, including:\n\nDetailed panels offer a deep dive into the complexities of the Secret War and the vibrant tapestry of Hmong history. Panels highlighting Hmong sports, such as the exceptional accomplishments of Olympic gold medalist Suni Lee, along with insights into Hmong culinary traditions, cultural practices, significant milestones, and more.\nA theater display features three documentaries, including a segment from \"60 Minutes\" in 1979 that discussed America's Secret War in Laos and the role of the Hmong community.\nEmbroidered story cloths and traditional flower cloths are showcased alongside detailed explanations. Story cloths originated as a contemporary art form after the Hmong community's settlement in the U.S., while the symbolic significance of the flower cloths, deeply rooted in Hmong artistic heritage, is elaborated upon.\n\n\n== Additional Resources ==\nThe Hmong Cultural Center Museum also shares the Hmong Resource Center Library, which houses an extensive collection of Hmong-related literature and scholarly materials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota",

His father was Marcus Popilius Laenas, consul in 173 BC.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 154 BC, Laenas was sent as an ambassador to Liguria to investigate the accusations of the residents of the allied city of Massalia against the Ligurians of depredations and raids. In 146 BC, as part of an embassy to Corinth, Laenas was beaten up by a seditious crowd. This prompted Lucius Mummius to sack the city later that year in the Achaean War.\nIn 139 BC, he was elected consul together with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso as his colleague. He took the province of Hispania Citerior and remained proconsul until 137 BC.  There he unsuccessfully attempted to end the insurrection led by Viriathus, a Lusitanian chieftain that had defeated his consular predecessor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Colin Jones (born 1934) is an English artist and sculptor whose work has been regarded as a constructive and systematic one. His works have been exhibited and preserved in several public collections in England, including the Arts Council and the Tate gallery.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJones was educated at Rudolf Steiner School, where he was influenced by the colour theories of Goethe and Kandinsky. He proceeded to Goldsmiths' College of Art under Kenneth Martin and Mary Martin. Jones taught at Leicester Polytechnic.\nJones exhibited with the Systems Group and showed alongside fellow systems and constructivist artists in a series of important exhibitions during the 1960s and 1970s including the Arts Council Touring Exhibition, Construction England (1963); Unit Series Progression, Arts Council Gallery Cambridge (1967); Systems at the Whitechapel Gallery and tour (1972). At Systems, Jones exhibited a three-part relief: Rotation, Reflection, Progression Structure, developing a light modulating structure \"including relief elements of tone, colour and reflected light.\" While the Tate gallery holds the White Rotation relief, Jones subsequently destroyed the other two: Reflection and Progression.\nJones also worked on a number of commissions, including an open-air sculpture for Leicester city centre (1970); a wall relief for Leicester University (1981–82) and a neon sculpture for Sharespace Shopping Arcade in Nottingham. His Relief Construction (1983), made of aluminium, mild steel and cellulose paint, adorns the Charles Wilson Building at the University of Leicester.\nArt historian Alan Fowler discusses Colin Jones's systems work in his 2006 PhD thesis \"Constructive Art in Britain 1913 – 2005\".   Jones is also mentioned in Alastair Grieve's 2005 book \"Constructed Abstract Art in England After the Second World War: A Neglected Avant-Garde\".\n\n\n== Group Exhibitions ==\n\n\n== Works in Public Collections ==\nArts Council Collection London\nTate Britain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] Constructivist Art in Britain 1913–2005 by Alan Fowler (2006)\n[2] Tate Gallery Collection",

        "content": "Stop Time: Live at Prince Street, 1978 is an archival live album by drummer Barry Altschul, double bassist David Izenzon (whose name is misspelled as \"Izenson\" on the cover), and clarinetist Perry Robinson. It was recorded on October 14, 1978, at 131 Prince Street in New York City, and was released in 2023 by NoBusiness Records. The album captures a one-off session, organized by Izenzon, at a time when all three musicians were important and active participants in the New York-based loft jazz scene.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe wrote: \"While all three musicians are such accomplished improvisers that they are quite capable of extemporizing the repeated motifs and simple folky refrains which adorn each number, there are also sufficient well-turned phrases and shared recurring snags to suggest an overseeing mind; who that might be, though, is lost in the mists of time. However, that is irrelevant to the joy to be had in these playful exchanges from a threesome, at the top of their game, who illuminate the interplay with their individual brilliance.\"\nThe editors of The New York City Jazz Record declared the album an \"unearthed gem,\" and reviewer Stuart Broomer remarked: \"There are few sounds as heartening as a lost recording by a previously unknown band possessed of collective and individual brilliance. This 45-year-old tape is an exceptional showcase... The cumulative effect of the three musicians is as impressive as some great saxophonists' minimalist trios, just as virtuosic but more egalitarian too.\"\nPoint of Departure's Michael Rosenstein commented: \"listening to the masterful collective interplay... one would easily assume that this was a long-running ensemble... What strikes the listener immediately is how fluid the roles of the musicians are. From the first notes, they eschew any notion of a traditional reeds/bass/drums trio.\"\nIn his contribution to the 18th annual Francis Davis Jazz Critics Poll, Ken Waxman of Jazz Word selected the album as one of the top archival releases of 2023. In a review, he praised Altschul's ability to provide \"sympathetic, sophisticated yet strong accents,\" noting he had \"perfected the melding of hard bop power with free jazz multiple tempos.\" Waxman stated that Robinson \"unites the four untitled improvisations with melodic trills and flutters, interjected squeaks and circular squeals and miniature reed bites,\" while Izenzon's \"arco variations are often tinged with melancholy and confidently work up the scale, while his pizzicato work expands with triple stopping pattern.\"\nWriting for the Downtown Music Gallery, Bruce Lee Gallanter wrote: \"Everything flows here freely with a stream... The rhythm team here are locked in together... Altschul's playing here is consistently inspired and inventive, occasionally kicking up a storm of rhythmic eruptions.\"\nIn an article for WJCT's Jacksonville Music Experience, Daniel A. Brown called the album \"an impressive time capsule of high-potency NYC free jazz,\" and stated that the recording \"finds the trio putting their instruments through the paces, yet never allowing their collective virtuosity to hinder the elemental shapes they release.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Untitled I\" – 12:19\n\"Untitled II\" – 6:39\n\"Untitled III\" – 14:29\n\"Untitled IV\" – 19:45\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerry Robinson – clarinet\nDavid Izenzon – double bass\nBarry Altschul – drums\n\n\n== References ==",

He subsequently named his backing band the Real Deal. The Real Deal was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for best \"Traditional Blues Album\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Mike Vernon, who had signed Primer to his label. Vernon thought that Primer came closest of the contemporary blues musicians to the sound of 1950s and 1960s Chicago blues. Billy Branch contributed on harmonica; David Maxwell played piano. \"Good Understanding\" is a cover of the Willie Dixon song. \"Come Back Baby\" is a cover of Ray Charles's version of the tune. Primer played slide guitar on \"I Called My Baby\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Indianapolis Star praised the \"simple four-piece band that shuffles, boogies, rocks and wails its way through a strong slate of songs.\" Stereo Review wrote that Primer's \"assertive voice and buoyant guitar are propelled in just the right groove\" by his backing band. The Chicago Tribune noted the \"tough, no-nonsense swagger of his classic Chicago blues sound,\" writing that \"Primer never wastes a note, never seems particularly eager to show off.\"\nThe Springfield News-Leader determined that the album \"smoothly blends contemporary and traditional blues.\" The Richmond Times-Dispatch concluded that \"the extensive guitar technique and emotive vocals are shadowed and embellished by Primer's band.\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that Primer's \"gritty vocals and stinging guitar carry the genuine trademark of this swaggering Chicago music.\"\nAllMusic called the album \"long on intensity and devoid of pretension.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Quratul-Ain Bandial known as Ain Bandial is a journalist and media entrepreneur in Brunei. She co-founded and became the editor of \"The Scoop\" in 2017. It is the first newsdesk run by women in Brunei. It has launched its own magazine and it has more readers than the population of Brunei.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShe began work as a journalist for the Brunei Times in about 2010. She worked on news concerning Brunei and south-east Asia. In 2016 the Brunei Times gave its readers 24 hours notice that the newspaper was to cease publication. The reason given was competition and continuing financial losses although it was also noticed that the paper had published a news story that it had redacted about the cost of tickets to Mecca for pilgrimages. It was said to be a \"forced closure\". In 2017 Bandial helped create a new and independent news source. The website cost $1,700. The Scoop is the first newsdesk in Brunei led by women and it was self funded and founded by four people: Ain Bandial, Hadthiah Hazair, Rachel Thien, Rasidah Hj Abu Bakar. Ain Bandial and Rasidah Hj Abu Bakar served as the editors in an organisation that is lean. There are many contributors but only a small number of employees.\nBandial joined the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) Women's Leadership Academy in 2017.\nShe has written about free speech for the Brunei Times. She believes that censorship in Brunei is not a result of the law but of self-censorship by the country's journalists. She accuses them of becoming \"merely stenographers for government officials\". They can be jailed for three years and news outlets can be stopped if the authorities believe there has been \"false of malicious\" news. This judgement is arbitrary so journalists stay clear of stories that might be sensitive. Bandial believes that the government is failing to gain the advantage of valid criticism.\nBrunei has a very high proportion of its population using social media. It was reported that Brunei was the highest in south east Asia with nearly 70% of citizens using social media. The Scoop had a difficult time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bandial saw that they had a significant role keeping the public informed and to counter misinformation. On the other hand they had new restrictions due to COVID-19 and their advertising revenue was falling. Over five months they lost 90% of their advertising. The Scoop created videos to inform about progress with vaccinations. Staff worked for over 100 days continuously without a day off or holiday.\nBandial said that the number of people reading the Scoop exceeded the population of Brunei with the majority of readers between 18 and 34. By 2019 The Scoop had created its own internet radio and YouTubes and it was available in print as a colour magazine. Advertising and sponsored content was paying for six staff. By 2020 The Scoop had 70,000 followers on social media and 80,000 people read The Scoop per month.\nShe is a fellow of the Earth Journalism Network.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Santuario di Maria Santissima della Fontenuova, or Sanctuary of the Holiest Mary of the New Fountain/Spring, is a Marian shrine (church) in piazza Giusti #305 in Monsummano Terme, Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 16th century, the region where the church stands was fallow swampy land, only frequented by shepherds. In 9 June 1573, a simple shepherdess, Jacopina Mariotti, lost he flock near here, and prayed to a series of images painted on a small wall at this spot. Putatively a Marian apparition or vision informed the girl of where her flock was found. \nThis prompted the locals to erect this Marian shrine dedicated to the Madonna of the Planes (Madonna del Piano). Initially this was a small chapel, but putatively increasing miracles, including during a 10 June 1602 service by the town rector Simone Casciani, after a long drought, a spring burst at the spot, this prompted the enlargement of the sanctuary under the patronage of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I de’ Medici in a building designed by Gherardo Mechini.\nConstruction began on 30 December 1602, in a ceremony attended the court including the prince Cosimo and the wife of Ferdinand, Maria Cristina di Lorena. In 1607, the Grand Duke commissioned erection of a Hostel for pilgrims, adjacent to the Sanctuary. In 1607, Ferdinand donated a bejeweled crown by Cosimo Latini to the sanctuary. A number of artists helped decorate the sanctuary including Bronzino, Cosimo Rosselli, and Domenico Passignano. The ceiling paintings in the nave are an Virgin of the Assumption by Matteo Rosselli; an Annunciation by Gregorio Pagani and a Coronation of the Virgin by Donato Mascagni. The ceiling frieze contains a Veduta di Monsummano Alto (1607) and Prophets, attributed to Vanni da Vellano (1607), while the Sibyls were painted by Giovanni Valeriani. The next register has Saints Sebastian, Jeromy, Francis, and Carlo Borrromeo painted by Matteo Rosselli. He also painted an altarpiece depicting the Adoration by the Magi. An altarpiece depicting the Presentation of Mary at the Temple is attributed to Cristofano Allori and the Mary, St Anne and John the Baptist byPier Dandini. A Crucifix in the sacristy is attributed to Giambologna. Giovanni Mannozzi, also called Giovanni da San Giovanni, frescoed starting in 1630 the 14 lunettes under the loggia. The central lunette has a bust of Maria Cristina flanked by moderately damaged frescoes by Ventura Salimbeni.\nThe sanctuary is still the goal of pilgrimages (Peregrinatio Mariae) and processions. They crypt, built in 1962 still has the spring coursing through it, feeding an immersion pool meant to heal the sick. In 1962, the Madonna of Fontenova was proclaimed the patron of the diocese of Pescia. In 1974, cardinal Paolo Bertoli, Camarlengo of the vatican, announced that Pope Paul VI had elevated the sanctuary to a minor basilica.\nIn the space in front of the church is a Monument to the poet Giuseppe Giusti, sculpted by  Cesare Fantacchiotti.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Savage Tooele Railroad is a shortline railroad under construction along the former Western Pacific Railroad Warner Branch, to the Lakeview Business Park in Grantsville, Utah. The railroad is approximately 11 miles long. Authorization from the Surface Transportation Board to build the railroad was given in April 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Western Pacific Railroad originally built the Warner Branch (also referred to as the \"Tooele Branch\" in some timetables) in 1917 to connect the Western Pacific to the Tooele Valley Railway, accessing the traffic from the International Smelting and Refining Company plant in Tooele, Utah. An interchange with the Tooele Army Depot was built in 1943 providing further traffic along the branch. Following the merger between the Western Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad the branch would be deemed surplus, and was largely abandoned. Rails were removed from Tooele to the unincorporated community of Marshall, Utah in 2003. A significant portion of the right of way on the Tooele to Grantsville portion of the Warner Branch exists presently as the Mid-Valley Trail.\nIn 2020, the Romney Group (owned by Josh Romney, son of Utah senator Mitt Romney) and NorthPoint Development broke ground on the Lakeview Business Park, north of the Utah Motorsports Campus. The Savage Tooele Railroad was founded as a common carrier railroad under parent company Savage (who operate the nearby Savage Bingham and Garfield Railroad in Salt Lake County) to restore and operate the Warner Branch to the business park and filed an appeal in 2021 with the Surface Transportation Board to begin construction of the railroad line. The project was backed by Utah governor Spencer Cox and representatives John Curtis and Chris Stewart, but concerns were raised by the Environmental Protection Agency due to the railroad's proximity to wetlands near the Great Salt Lake. Tooele County agreed to replace a segment of the Mid-Valley Trail right of way with a bypass segment, to clear the right of way for the Savage Tooele Railroad. Motions to begin construction on the railroad were denied in 2021 and 2022, pending the completion of an environmental report which was finished in 2024, after a draft environmental report had been issued in 2023.\nIn February 2024, the STB granted permission to the Union Pacific Railroad to restore the upper portion of the Warner Branch to service for interchange with the Savage Tooele Railroad. BNSF Railway had appealed for lengthier STB proceedings to allow access to interchange with the Savage Tooele Railroad via trackage rights, however currently the STB has denied this appeal. Permission was granted by the STB for the Savage Tooele Railroad to begin construction from its connection with the Union Pacific to the Lakeview Business Park in April that year. The railroad will also serve the Twenty Wells Project associated with the Utah Inland Port in Grantsville, Utah.\n\n\n== References ==",

The result was a landslide victory for the People's Radical Party.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe elections were the first held under the 1888 constitution. Following the introduction of the new constitution, an Electoral Act was passed in March 1890, which provided for nearly universal male suffrage and introduced the secret ballot.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe People's Radical Party won over 100 seats, while the Liberal Party won 14 and the Serbian Progressive Party just one (won by its leader Milutin Garašanin).\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNikola Pašić was appointed president of the National Assembly and Dimitrije Katić as vice president. When Pašić became Prime Minister in February 1891, Katić replaced him as president while Pavle Vuković became vice president.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mountfort Street is a historic downtown street in Portland, Maine, United States. It runs for around 0.22 miles (0.35 km), from Congress Street, at the foot of Munjoy Hill, in the northwest to Fore Street in the southeast. It forms the eastern boundary of Eastern Cemetery, which was established in 1668.\nGeorge Munjoy (c. 1626–1680), for whom Munjoy Hill is named, lived in a fortified house, known as Munjoy's Garrison, near the corner of Mountfort Street and Fore Street, which was then at the shoreline. Munjoy had moved north from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1659 to what was then Falmouth, Province of Maine. \nThe street is believed to have been named for Edmund Mountfort (1694–1737), a merchant who arrived in Portland from Boston in 1728. The family of Daniel Mountfort, meanwhile,  built a home around the Mountfort/Fore Street intersection at the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe home of Charles Frederick, Harriet Stephenson Eastman and Alexander Stephenson, at the corner of Mountfort and Newbury Streets, is denoted by a stone marker of the Portland Freedom Trail.\nAfter the American Civil War, the Eagle Sugar Refinery was established on Fore Street at the foot of Mountfort Street. Located adjacent to the Portland Company locomotive foundry, it was well positioned to distribute its goods efficiently. Sugarcane arrived into the refinery warehouse from Cuba via ships that docked at the local wharves. It remained in business until 1891.\n\n\n== Intersections ==\nThe following major streets intersect with Federal Street (from northwest to southeast):\n\nCongress Street\nFederal Street\nFore Street\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kaiserwald is a forest area in the Austrian province of Styria, a few kilometers south-southwest of the provincial capital of Graz. Its geological location, the Kaiserwald Terrace, is a clay-covered glacial gravel plateau above the Grazer field. The clay cap, which in the past enabled a local brick industry, provides a characteristic groundwater hydrology. Botanically, it is a mixed forest with pines and oaks as the dominant trees, providing a habitat for a wide variety of animal species and serving as a princely forest for centuries. The area is also significant for its numerous Roman burial mounds.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Kaiserwald was the site of armament activities of the German Armed Forces. Today, large parts of the 30-square-kilometer forest serve as recreational areas and commercial forests. Parts of the forest have been designated as protected areas. Due to its ecological and climatic relevance, the forest is anchored as a green zone in the local development concepts of the surrounding communities. With the Graz-Köflach railway (GKB) and the A2 South motorway, two important traffic routes cross the Kaiserwald.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location and surroundings ===\n\nThe Kaiserwald is located in the region of Western Styria. In the south, it borders on the foothills of the Plabutsch-Buchkogel mountain range and the Western Styria Hügelland, and in the east, it runs parallel to the Grazer Feld (Murtal). To the west and south, the Kaiserwald terrace is bordered by the lower Kainachtal. The geomorphologic boundary lies in the north at about 365 m (1,197 ft 6 in) above sea level, where the terrain is directly divided, and in the northwest in the Spatenhof area.\nIt is difficult to draw a historically accurate boundary to the north and northwest. Until the forest was sold in the 19th\ncentury, some of the land on the other side of Packer Street was also owned by the prince and was called Kaiserwald. The forest stretches about 13 kilometers in a northwest–southeast direction and is 1.5 to 2.5 kilometers wide. The total area is about 30 square kilometers, including the enclosed farmland. The center of Graz is located about nine kilometers from the northeastern edge of the forest near Pirka.\n\nThe following municipalities (from north to south) are part of the Kaiserwald:\n\nSeiersberg-Pirka\nHaselsdorf-Tobelbad\nPremstätten\nLieboch\nDobl-Zwaring\nWundschuh\nWildon\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nThe Kaiserwald Terrace is a plateau dissected by gullies that is morphologically and geologically distinct from its surroundings. On average, the terrace rises 27 meters above the Grazer field and 35 meters above the Kainachtal valley. Numerous boreholes, wells, and slope fractures have revealed a gravel terrace covered by loam of varying thickness. Due to ongoing erosive processes, only about 55 percent of the Kaiserwald terrace has the character of a plateau, while the remainder has steeper slopes and therefore less sediment thickness.\nArthur Winkler-Hermaden dated the landform to the Gunz and Mindel glaciation periods of the Pleistocene and interpreted the clay cap as an interglacial loam formation. At the eastern edge of the Kaiserwald terrace are younger terrace remnants, e.g. between Windorf and Hautzendorf from the Riss glaciation, remnants of which can also be found in Graz-Wetzelsdorf. The southeastern continuation of the Kaiserwald terrace between Steindorf, Ponigl, and Weitendorf is only ten meters above the level of the Würm main terrace (Grazer Field) and was assigned to the Helfbrunn level by Winkler-Hermaden. While the Pleistocene origin of the gravel terrace is now considered certain, Julius Fink invalidated the Aeolian clay theory. He interpreted the loams as multiphase aeolian drifts from the nearby gravel fields of the Mur. Loess samples with different quartz and feldspar proportions also indicate this.\nThe gravel body with an average thickness of 13 meters and silty-sandy admixtures consist of gneiss, crystalline schist, pegmatite, amphibolite, and quartz. Carbonate rocks are absent from the partly strongly weathered gravel. X-ray diffraction studies also revealed kaolinite as a product of feldspar weathering. The clay cap, with varying proportions of clay, silt, and sand, has an average thickness of six meters, although this varies greatly, and is divided by fossil soil horizons. The boundary between the two layers is sometimes fluid. As a result of relatively high rainfall, pseudogleyes have formed, which are unusable for agriculture.\nThe brick industry used clay roof tiles for a long time. In 1869, on the initiative of Ferdinand Portugall, the first factory was built in Unterpremstätten, which developed into the First Premstätten Interlocking brick factory Anton Haas & Co. founded in 1893. At its peak, between 150 and 200 workers produced more than seven million roof tiles per year. In the early 1970s, the plant was still producing four million tiles a year. During construction work in Weitendorf, a more than 10,000-year-old molar of a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was found in the clay and gravel deposits.\nAt the southern end of the Kaiserwald is the Weitendorf basalt quarry, where a small part of an up to 40 meter thick basalt layer is exposed. It extends over an area of about ten square kilometers between Weitendorf and Wundschuh. The quarry is located in the area of Weitendorf on the one hand and in the area of Wundschuh on the other hand, where the volcanite was found in the 1950s and 1960s during drilling at a depth of 25 to 35 meters.\n\n\n=== Hydrology and hydrogeology ===\nDue to the water-accumulating clay cap, runoff on the Kaiserwald terrace is largely above ground. The dominant watercourses, the Gepringbach and the Poniglbach, contribute to the strongly furrowed morphology of the plateau. While the Poniglbach erodes the gravel complex, the Gepringbach cuts deep into the bedrock. The gravel body, which has a low water flow due to its high clay content, rests on a base of young Tertiary fine sediments, the upper edge of which extends above the level of the Würm terraces surface. Numerous overflow springs were mapped at this boundary in the mid-1970s.\n\nA total of 36 springs are distributed along the southern part of the terrace. While on the southwest side, the springs are continuously discharged at a height of seven to eight meters above the valley floor of the Kainach, in the east they only occur between Premstätten and Wundschuh, where the Wurm terrace directly adjoins the Kaiserwald terrace. The investigation of three selected springs revealed discharge rates of about 1.5 l/s. As the clay cap largely prevents leachate and good mixing in the aquifer, the low variation in discharge can be explained by the uniform inflow. After heavy rainfall, meteoric water often accumulates in ponds and lowlands in the Kaiserwald. Groundwater recharge occurs in the extreme north of the terrace by infiltration from the southern foothills of the Florianiberg, where the Kaiserwald terrace is in direct contact with the dolomitic--sandstone sequence and coarse clastic loose sediments of the Graz Highlands. In the south, the relatively high-temperature fluctuations of the springs mentioned above have led to infiltration through the surface channels, which break up sand and gravel in the course of their erosive activity. This connection is important in terms of water management since the perennial inflow ensures regular water extraction. In addition, the clay cover provides good protection against groundwater contamination, which is often characterized by high iron content and oxygen deficiency.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe Kaiserwald is part of the climate region Grazer field with the lower Kainachtal, which is characterized by a continental climate with average annual temperatures of about 8.7 °C - the January average is -2.4 °C, the July average is 19.1 °C - and annual precipitation of about 833 mm at the ZAMG station Graz Airport. The growing season (average temperature ≥ 5 °C) lasts on average 230 days from the beginning of March to the beginning of November. The relative sunshine duration, which varies depending on the location, averages 42 percent throughout the year.\nIn terms of local climate, however, the terrace differs considerably from the Grazer Feld. In terms of climatic suitability, the Kaiserwald Terrace is more suitable for residential and commercial development than the lower-lying Würm Main Terrace, mainly due to the lower risk of inversion. However, due to the local occurrence of cold air, the favorable thermal conditions are limited, which leads to the classification as a \"less favorable terrace location\". However, a clear advantage over the immediate surroundings is the frequency of fog, which at 70 to 100 days per year is low compared to the nearby airport (149 days). At the Helfbrunn level between Steindorf, Ponigl, and Weitendorf, this effect is limited. The Kaiserwald terrace is also characterized by low to moderate aeration with an annual mean wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. As in the entire Graz Basin, the main wind direction is northwest. Special conditions concerning fog, cold air, and flow conditions prevail in the Gepringbach and Doblbach gullies, as well as in some smaller side gullies with low wind shear. In the Doblbachtal, cold air can accumulate along the GKB railway embankment and the highway.\nAs a climate-impacting area, the Kaiserwald makes a valuable contribution to sustainable spatial development at the regional level.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nIn terms of stand structure and species composition, the Kaiserwald largely corresponds to the potential natural forest types of the region. In between there are some spruce monocultures, while in other places the largely closed forest area shows traces of former litter use. Overall, the dominant plant community is the pine-pedunculate oak forest, rich in moor grass, on moist, acidic, gleyed soils, where beech, birch, black alder, rowan and wild cherry also occur. The herb layer is made up of dense stands of moor grass, heather, blueberry, and cranberry. The moss layer is made up of bryophytes, bryozoans, fork mosses, white mosses, and even bog mosses, which benefit from acidic soil conditions.\n\nThe tertiary Tobelbader Berg is an exception from a phytosociological point of view. It is dominated by a mixed pine forest rich in blueberries, with stands of Scots pine interspersed with spruce and common beech. The English oak takes a back seat to the sweet chestnut. Deciduous trees dominate the undergrowth, while the herbaceous layer is made up of blueberries, bracken, blackberries, cranberries, various brooms, heather, cow wheat, forest hawkweed, reed grass, wavy hair-grass, and narrow-leaved woodrush. In spring, lilies of the valley and butterfly orchids appear in places.\nIn some places, there is a clear-cut succession. The herbaceous layer is supplemented by bentgrasses, common rush, eared willow, wild basil, and tormentil. Neophytes such as balsam and Canadian goldenrod are also present. Special conditions also prevail along the numerous streams and ponds. The undergrowth of black carr, interspersed with gray alder, ash, and white birch, is complemented by bioindicators such as stinging nettle, flowering plants, meadowsweet, marsh marigold, ragged-robin, plume thistle, marsh hawk's-beard, water forget-me-not, and herb Paris. In addition to black alder, English oak and birch, various species of willow and common guelder rose can be found on the slopes of the clay pits. These are the pioneer species of bog forest communities.\nOn the road from Zettling to the Kaiserwald, Josef Eggler discovered in 1927 the presence of the round-leaved sundew, an insect-trapping bog plant, on very wet patches of peat moss, but this could not be confirmed in the recent past.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn addition to the typical forest fauna, with roe deer as the most common representative, the Kaiserwald is home to several bird species, including the goldcrest and the oriole. In the past there was also a population of capercaillie. After being driven out by culling, 30 capercaillies were counted annually around 1940. It is said that Frederick the Quarrelsome had the Gjaidhof hunting lodge decorated with hundreds of capercaillies and, according to tradition, even Emperor Maximilian made a detour to Dobl to shoot capercaillies.\n\nThe natural streams, such as the meandering Gepringbach, provide valuable habitat for flat worms, caddisflies, crayfish, river shrimp and, when there is sufficient water, brook trout, river trout and brook lamprey. Occasionally, broad-winged damselflies and dragonflies can be found. Special attention was paid to the brick ponds near Unterpremstätten, now a nature reserve (see Nature and Landscape Protection), where amphibians such as true frogs, moor frogs, crested newts, newts, common toads and tree frogs can be found. Breeding birds include mallards and coots, while grey herons and night herons are occasionally seen feeding. The ponds also provide habitat for several species of dragonflies. Between 1964 and 1972, 35 species of net-winged insects were counted in the entire Kaiserwald. In 2005, evidence of the highly endangered ilex hairstreak was found on the Forstriegel near Zettling. The forest is also home to at least 25 different species of longhorn beetles.\nResearch on tick-borne encephalitis, which began in 1969, identified the Kaiserwald, along with Mortantsch and Rötschgraben (municipality of Semriach), as one of three epidemic hotspots in Styria, i.e. areas with virus-transmitting ticks and infected small mammals.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Archaeological findings ===\n\nThere are more than 120 Roman burial mounds on the edge of the Kaiserwald Terrace, first described in detail by Marianne Grubinger in 1935. Most of the mounds date from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD and are arranged in several groups. The modest grave goods suggest that the population was rural. Under the direction of Grubinger, the Landesmuseum Joanneum found objects such as tripod bowls, clay jugs and glass beakers, as well as a few bronze coins, mainly depicting the Emperor Hadrian. According to prehistoric custom, the hand-made clay contained a lot of mica and quartz sand, and the decorations with rows of notches are stylistically dated to the La Tène period. A local peculiarity of the finds is the absence of folded cups, lamps and Roman bronze objects.\nGrubinger recognized the Hallstatt burial form common in the Roman provinces, in which a corpse was cremated directly at the grave site and the cremated remains filled into vessels. Everything was then placed in the pyre, which was surrounded by round or rectangular stone walls. In the Kaiserwald the building material had to be brought from far away, e.g. Leitha limestone from the Wildoner Berg. Chemical analysis of one of the graves revealed a nitrogen-rich, fat-free organic mixture, probably a plant resin. An earlier find, which was kept in the Gjaidhof for a long time, is the Roman tomb relief, which is now attached to the church wall of Maria im Dorn in Dobl. Grubinger sees it as a portrait stone showing a Roman soldier with his wife and child and a second woman, possibly his mother. This work is said to have been part of a larger funerary monument of wealthy people to commemorate the death of the child.\nGrubinger associates the abandonment of the settlements and the end of the use of the cemetery with the Marcomannic Wars of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which also led to an economic decline in the regional capital of Flavia Solva.\nFurther finds were made by Siegfried Stadlhofer, who made several small finds with a metal detector between 1986 and 1993. The fibula found were published in the 1996 reports of the Federal Monuments Office, and there had already been complaints about recent grave-robbing in the Kaiserwald area. Grubinger had already noted dozens of earlier openings of burial mounds by farmers or \"treasure hunters\", which were manifested by depressions at the top of the mound.\nThe largest cemeteries are located in the cadastral districts of Fading and Dietersdorf. A cemetery with 16 burial mounds located by Grubinger in the Zwaring area has not yet been located. The burial mounds in the Schröttengraben in Fading were last thoroughly investigated a few years ago. A burial in the form of a stone sarcophagus had already been discovered in this area in 1974. Between 2008 and 2010, several emergency excavations were carried out by the Federal Office for the Protection of Monuments and the non-profit organization Archäologieland Steiermark due to the planned construction of a pond. At the bottom of the trench, not only Roman but also Bronze Age settlement remains from the 14th and 13th centuries BC were discovered. Investigation of the mounds brought discoveries: a grave filled with Roman bricks for unknown reasons, and an atypical flat grave whose carelessly deposited cremated remains indicate a pauper's grave. Most important, however, were the ceramic finds, which can be dated back to the Lasinja culture of the Copper Age. Whether the pre-Roman finds, more than 6000 years old, indicate settlements or tombs has not yet been determined. All burial mounds in the Kaiserwald have been listed since 1999.\nA marble portrait head from the Roman period is also believed to have been found in the Kaiserwald. However, the Landesmuseum Joanneum suspects that this work of art was stolen from Apollonia by members of the German armed forces during World War II and then deposited in the Styrian forest. As of 2015, restitution to Libya was still pending.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nIt was not until the Josephinian Land Survey of 1787 that much of the forest was given its current name. Prior to this, the forest area, with a few exceptions, was known as the Imperial Khart. The earlier meaning of the word \"Hart\" or \"Khart\" was no longer known in the 18th century, as can be seen from the inappropriate use of the term in the former municipality of Oberpremstätten. Originally, the term was used to describe a loose stand of trees, which in some places became dense, and is therefore rather a term for loosely connected forests. The status of the owner was first reflected in the name of the forest under Ernest the Iron,  when it was called \"des Herzogen Wald\". After the Styrian rulers became emperors in 1471, the forest was called \"Roman Emperor's Wood\". Until the 18th and 19th centuries, the official name was Forst zu Tobel or, derived from it, Dobler Forst. The Old High German word \"Dobl\" means something like forest ravine or forest cut.\n\n\n=== History of ownership and utilization ===\n\nAfter the Germanic-Franconian kings came to power in Slavic Carantania, the Imperial Forest became the property of the nobility in 788. The forest right was a royal right and could be granted to nobles, who also received the right to clear and colonize the land. Probably by means of an official fiefdom, this right passed from the Aribonian family to the Otakars and Traungauers in the High Middle Ages, who were the margraves and dukes of Styria at that time. Over the centuries, numerous donations resulted in complex legal relationships, and the western and southwestern edges of the forest were separated from the old forest at an early stage, for example by clearing farmland in the Carolingian village of Fading. Since the 13th century, the history of the forest has been closely linked to Gjaidhof Castle. The estate was an imperial hunting seat and later also housed the princely forestry office. The era of princely hunting began with the last Babenberg, Frederick the Quarrelsome, and ended with Charles VI. Watching a herd of deer from the castle one evening, he is said to have exclaimed: \"This is an imperial pleasure! For a long time, the imperial forest also supplied timber for the construction and scaffolding of princely buildings in Graz, such as the extension of the cistern on the Schlossberg in 1579.\nBecause of its role as a protected forest, local farmers had no or limited rights of use, such as grazing rights. These grazing rights divided the forest into sections, last recorded in 1773 and 1812. In addition, the inhabitants of the settlements on the edge of the forest had to face many challenges; a plague of wolves and wild boars is recorded in 1636. Parts of the forest, crisscrossed by mill and church roads, were ceded to neighboring Lords, such as the Counts of Montfort. The sovereign had the right to prohibit game in the entire Imperial Forest, including the lands of the noble lords. Violations of both hunting and forestry laws were often punished with a torture chamber or imprisonment in the Graz casemates.\nAfter the Gjaidhof had been privately owned since 1780, it was decided to sell the Imperial Forest for economic reasons. Efforts to sell the forest had already been made under Ferdinand II and Maria Theresa. However, it was only after the abolition of serfdom by Joseph II that the Dobl Forest, with a total area of 2045 yoke, was put up for auction on May 5, 1825. A table of confessions, adapted from the French land register, summarized the areas to be sold. With the highest bid of 81,060 florins, three authorized representatives of the united peasantry acquired the properties, which were eventually divided among 517 buyers from 29 surrounding communities.\nIt was not until 1866 that the final land register order was established and the hunting rights were acquired by Schloss Neuschloß.\n\n\n==== Confession table ====\nName of the sale: Place names of the properties (1825); only areas in the Dobler Forest are listed.\nParcel(s): Parcel numbers in the Franzis sign Land Register (1820/1823); the center of the parcel is indicated.\nCadastral parish: Cadastral parish according to the territorial status at the time.\nArea: Area in Yoke (J.) and square kilometer (qkl.) as well as converted into hectare (ha); 1 Austrian Yoke corresponds to 1600 square kilometer and 0.575464 hectare.\n\nSecond World WarIn the course of the building measures for the creation of \"Greater Graz\", construction activities also began in Kaiserwald in 1939. In 1941/1942, as part of the wartime expansion towards south-eastern Europe, an ammunition factory (Muna) was built near the present-day settlement of Kaiserwald, which was made accessible by an additional five-kilometer rail line from the Premstätten-Tobelbad station. The tracks of the standard-gauge Muna connecting line, which was dismantled immediately after the war, were subject to strict secrecy and were not included in the GKB plans. Railway historian Sepp Tezak was unable to gain much insight, even in conversations with contemporary witnesses. The brick industry in Unterpremstätten was pushed ahead with housing construction. On May 15, 1942, the construction work in Kaiserwald was stopped with the official reason that it was \"not important for the war effort\". The forced laborers employed there were transferred to Germany. 20 people died during construction and were buried at the site. According to a field command activity report, construction was to be resumed in October 1944. The responsible Upper Command gave the order to prepare the site of the planned ammunition depot for a larger ammunition depot using the buildings already completed in the shell. For this purpose, 200 Finn tents for ammunition storage and 1200 meters of field railroad track were to be provided. According to the report, difficulties in the construction of the siding included a lack of rail material, the supply of ballast for the substructure, and a shortage of labor. On October 16, 1944, the Allies conducted a targeted air raid on the Kaiserwald ammunition dumps. A squadron of about 30 aircraft coming from the west dropped about 240 bombs of 250 and 500 kilograms at 12 noon, destroying three hectares of forest and several buildings in the neighboring village of Zwaring. Rudolf Kainz, Grete Kainz, Cäcilia Kainz, Johanna Alter, Theresia Schreiner and Maria Denegger were killed, seven people were injured and nine were made homeless.\nSince 1938, there had also been a Reich Labor Service (RAD) camp in the Kaiserwald. For the establishment of the Steindorf camp (RAD Department 6/360), the responsible authority leased private farmland, which was returned to its rightful owner after the end of the war. Among other things, the workers were occupied with the regulation of the Kainach River, which in the meantime was reflected in the population figures of the community of Zwaring-Pöls, which reached a temporary peak in 1939. In January 1942, 160 people had to leave the camp, which led to the cessation of operations. The buildings were torn down in 1945.\nFrom the fall of 1946, the mine clearance service in the Kaiserwald was involved in the destruction of war material. In 1949, the Steirerblatt newspaper reported on the controlled detonation of bombs and other explosives from the Kalsdorf ammunition depot near Graz. According to regulations, the ammunition was transported by truck to a clearing in the forest and detonated from a bunker 300 meters away. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages were warned by a siren. The continuous detonations resulted in a distinctly young forest vegetation without undergrowth. Glowing explosives or incendiary devices caused the grass to burn quickly and take on a dry, yellowish form, so that the clearing, in combination with the large blast craters, resembled a \"moonscape\". Because of the high risk of fire, the work could only be done in winter. In the summer, clearing crews were on the move, land mines and other recovered explosives. By February 1949, 140 tons of war material had been defused in the Kaiserwald.\n\nSome of the remnants of the German army buildings can still be seen today. In addition to an unfinished looking reinforced concrete hall, called a \"temple\" by local residents, there are the foundations of several barracks, as well as some stone water tunnels and a large shooting range with three bullet traps. Since there are few records of Nazi activities in the Kaiserwald, the finds and ruins leave room for speculation, especially regarding the exact course of the connecting railroad. Information on the location and extent of the objects can be found in the online ALS data of the state.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nAfter the Second World War, the forest was increasingly used for recreational purposes. As early as 1947, there were concrete plans to establish a Styrian film production in the Kaiserwald. To this end, Austria Alpenland Avantgarde-Film Ltd. (\"Alpenfilm\") planned to connect seven houses on a twelve-yoke site - today's Kaiserwaldsiedlung - and convert them into sound studios and offices. In addition, a hotel for actors was to be built and an existing pond was to be converted into a bathing facility. The Steirerblatt newspaper called the project a \"valuable contribution to the reconstruction of the country. In contrast to the already world-famous Viennese film industry, \"Austrian\" films were to be produced. Even details of the first planned film were announced. \"Our star is sinking\" was to be a warning against the rise of atomic energy and was to star one of Austria's greatest film actors. The project ultimately proved unfeasible for cost reasons, and film production was moved to Thalerhof Airport, where several feature films were made until 1954. At the end of October 2020, the Graz Theater filmed war scenes for the apocalyptic film Krasnoyarsk in the dilapidated ammunition depot. The dramaturge called the \"concrete cathedral in the woods\" a \"magical place.\nLess concrete were future plans to develop the Kaiserwald into a modern recreational area for the people of Graz. A highway was to make it possible to reach the forest from the city in just a few minutes. The excavated material from an artificial bathing lake was to be used for road construction. These and similar ideas were discussed in the Forum Stadtpark in February 1966 after a discussion on the development goals of the city of Graz, and have been implemented, at least in part, to this day.\nOn March 16, 1961, one of the largest forest fires in Styria occurred in the Kaiserwald. Triggered by flying sparks from a GKB locomotive, five hectares of young forest burned to the ground. The firefighters from the five surrounding communities needed reinforcements from the Graz fire department to bring the one-kilometer-long fire under control. In November 2008, three people were killed when a Piper PA-34 crashed in the Kaiserwald forest between Zwaring and Wundschuh.\nIn February 2020, it became known that Strabag was having an environmental impact assessment carried out for a planned landfill in the local recreation area of Premstätten. Both the citizens' initiative Pro Premstätten and Mayor Anton Scherbinek announced their protest.\n\n\n== Utilization ==\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\nThe Kaiserwald terrace has remained largely untouched by settlement activity to this day. The reason for this is not only its former function as a princely hunting fores but also the clayey nature of the soil, which restricts agricultural use in many places. In addition, none of the streams have sufficient water flow for mill operations. There are only a few isolated contiguous districts, such as in the Unterpremstätten area or the Kaiserwald settlement, a former airmen's settlement near Zettling. Another more recent settlement that had to make way for forest is the Rehweg settlement on the Packer Bundesstraße, which also belongs to the municipality of Premstätten. Due to its importance as a green zone and its ecological role in the regional settlement model, the local development concepts of the municipalities (OEK) and the regional development program (REPRO) for the Styrian central region do not provide for any further building activities in the Kaiserwald area.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\n\nThe Graz-Köflach Railway (GKB), originally built to develop the lignite mining areas of western Styria, has traversed the Kaiserwald since its opening in 1859. The line first runs along the edge of the forest between Windorf (municipality of Seiersberg-Pirka) and Unterpremstätten and then crosses the forest in a straight line towards Lieboch. The only visible part of the line today is the siding of the German Armed Forces, which went deep into the forest and necessitated the extension of the station Premstätten-Tobelbad.\n\nOne of the most important traffic routes in Austria runs through the Kaiserwald in the form of the A2 South Motorway, also known as European route E66 in this section. Construction of the 8.5-kilometer section between today's Graz-West junction and Lieboch began in 1969. This fifth section of the Styrian South Highway was dubbed the \"Kaiserwald section\" and required 2.6 million cubic meters of earth movements for the superstructure and substructure, as well as the construction of the temporary roadway. At the same time, the Lieboch junction was built, including access ramps for the Radlpass road. The cost of the contract was estimated at 125 million Austrian Schillings, which was more than half of the annual federal budget for highway construction in Styria. A new construction method was used, which was presented in January 1971 at an information conference in the construction center in Graz by the working group \"subsoil\" of the research society for road construction in the association of engineers and architects together with a working committee of the Austrian lime industry. The addition of quicklime made a significant contribution to the stabilization of the loamy Kaiserwald terrace and the Kainach soil. Lime sand and gravel had already been used for the same purpose on local and freight roads, but not on highways. The Graz-Kaiserwald service station and restaurant are located on a plateau above the Gepringbach stream.\nIn addition, five provincial roads cross the forest, from north to south: Packer Straße B 70, Premstättener Straße L 376, Muttendorfer Straße L 374, Predinger Straße L 303 and Wundschuhstraße L 380.\n\n\n=== Local recreation ===\nA large part of the Kaiserwald is classified in the provincial forest development plan (WEP) as a forest with a high social function. There are numerous municipal hiking trails throughout the forest, including the Dobler Rundwanderweg, the Kneipp trail at Zwaring, and the educational trail at the Wundschuh Pond. In the southern part, the Grazer Umland-Weg (GUW), a long-distance hiking trail, crosses the Kaiserwald terrace between Dietersdorf and Ponigl. The Archduke-Johann-Radweg (provincial cycle path R9) runs along the L 374 to Stainz, while an unsigned cycle path runs along the L 303 to the Kaiserwaldsiedlung. In addition, the unpaved Peter-Rosegger-Weg between Zettling and Kaiserwaldsiedlung is open to cyclists.\n\nThe Wundschuh pond, one of several artificially created standing bodies of water on the Poniglbach stream, was converted into a bathing lake with a campsite in 1973, which was primarily intended as a recreational center for the city population of Graz. For some years now, the water area, also known as Wundschuh Lake, has been used as a fishing pond, just like the Windorf pond and the Kling pond near Unterpremstätten. All three bodies of water are part of protected landscape areas.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Nature and landscape conservation ===\nIn addition to its recreational character, nature and landscape conservation is of great importance. As of 2017, there are two nature reserves, two landscape conservation areas and two protected landscape areas, one area designated as a \"biotope\" by the province of Styria and one European nature reserve (Natura 2000). The latter includes the Neuteich pond, the smallest of the four Wundschuh ponds, and protects the four-leaf clover fern (Marsilea quadrifolia) found there in accordance with Directive 92/43/EEC (Fauna-Flora-Habitat Directive) of the European Union. The nature reserve near Unterpremstätten, which protects a number of ponds on the former clay mining site, should also be highlighted. The brick ponds outside the forest had already been filled in for housing construction in 1989, which led to the disappearance of some rare plant species. The regional development program for the Styrian central region provides for a biotope network for the Kaiserwald in the Wundschuh area with the green zones of the Mur floodplains in Werndorf.\n\nIn addition, three objects in the Kaiserwald and in the area of the Kaiserwald Terrace have been declared natural monuments. In the municipality of Dobl-Zwaring, a large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos) and a pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) were listed in 1979, and in the municipality of Wildon (then Weitendorf), parts of a basalt quarry were listed in 1985.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn the neighboring community of Wundschuh, the Imperial Forest indirectly found its way into heraldry. The municipal coat of arms, granted in 1965, shows a black snake with a golden crown between two spruces. This motif goes back to the Middle High German place name \"Wurmschach\", where \"wurm\" refers to a snake and \"schach\" to a secluded forest. The remnants of the forest between the agricultural and industrial areas of the Grazer Field are still called Schachen forests. An actual \"snake forest\" is said to have existed in the form of a marsh in the Kaiserwald. In order to be protected from the bites of the poisonous reptiles, high fur boots had to be worn during the clearing work.\nOn November 5, 1933, the Kleine Zeitung printed the story The robber chief of the Kaiserwald by Karl Reiterer on its front page. The story is set in the Kaiserwald forest in 1787, where a dreaded band of robbers is up to mischief. When Oswald Morain, a wealthy merchant from Graz, fails to return from Trieste one day, he sends his maid Rosi to find him. The young girl disguises herself as a boy and takes a carriage to Premstätten. After being attacked by robbers, she not only finds the missing merchant Steffl, but is horrified to discover that her lover Hansl, who works as an ox-buyer for a smoking master, has become the chief of the bandits. Hansl had gambled away the 400 guilders for his last job in a Puntigam inn and, fearing to return empty-handed, accompanied his adversaries, two robbers, into the Imperial Forest. Rosi and Steffl report their plight to Graz, whereupon the military is sent to track down the bandits in the undergrowth of the forest. In Graz, the robbers, including \"Schinderpeter\" and \"Rote Jöbstl,\" are put on trial. They escape the gallows, but are sentenced to several years' imprisonment in the Reckturm. Deeply saddened by the fate of her lover, Rosi turns to the Emperor himself during a visit to the city by Joseph II. She begs the Emperor to have mercy on her Hansl until he reduces his prison sentence. Rosi and Hansl later marry and establish the inn \"Zum steirischen Hiesel\" on Griesplatz.\nIn addition to the name of the highway rest area, the name Kaiserwald is also found in three street names in the surrounding area. There is the street Am Kaiserwald in Weitendorf and a Kaiserwaldweg in the Kaiserwaldsiedlung (municipality of Premstätten) as well as in Kasten (municipality of Wundschuh). The name of a street of the same name in the 9th district of Waltendorf, more than ten kilometers away, goes back to a local piece of forest.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarrow cemetery Fading\nBarrow cemetery Zwaring\n\n\n== Bibliography and maps ==\nMarianne Grubinger: Die römischen Gräber im Kaiserwalde südlich von Graz.

It was discovered in Jebel Barkal and is currently part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt.\nFollowing its discovery, the Stele of Piye was published by Auguste Mariette in 1872. It consists of a front, a reverse, a two thick sides, all covered with text. Emmanuel de Rougé published a complete word-by-word translation in French in 1876.\nThe stele inscription describes Piye as very religious, compassionate, and a lover of horses.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNimlot of Hermopolis\nPeftjauawybast\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGalpaz, Pnina (1993). \"The Victory Stela of King Piye: The Biblical Perspective on War and Peace\".

The forewings (tegmina) are green with green spots, with the basal half and area at two-thirds of the tegmina white. The basal patch of the hindwings is white or luteous. The shape of the cephalic process combined with white areas on tegmina will differentiate it from all species but P. coelestinus, from which it differs by having a red, not brown, cephalic process; dark green, not yellow, spots on the tegimen; and a different pattern of white on the tegmina.\n\n\n== Range and ecology ==\nIt is known from Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. It is known to feed on the sap of Dimocarpus longan.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIt is currently classified under the Pyrops candelaria group.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hit Me Hard and Soft (stylized in all caps) is the upcoming third studio album by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, set for release on May 17, 2024. Eilish announced the album on April 8, after teasing the project on billboards in various locations.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nEilish co-wrote and recorded her second studio album, Happier Than Ever, at her brother Finneas O'Connell's home recording studio, located in the basement of his Los Angeles residence. In weekly schedules, recording took place between April 2020 and February 2021, with the final track listing being worked by the duo during the album's creation. Happier Than Ever was released on July 30, 2021; it was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and was nominated twice at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. Eilish surprise-released her second extended play (EP) Guitar Songs in July 2022; one of the two songs on the EP references the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the United States. The following year, she released \"What Was I Made For?\" for the soundtrack to the fantasy-comedy film Barbie (2023); she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the film during its production. For \"What Was I Made For?\", she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media.\nIn December 2022, Eilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album with O'Connell. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she mentioned that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023. Eilish later added that the album was \"almost done\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in December 2023. Three months later, she confirmed that the album had been mastered.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nVarious news articles reported billboards teasing snippets of lyrics for the album that appeared in multiple cities in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States in April 2024; although it does not mention the artist's name, her signature \"blohsh\" was recognized. The promotional billboards display cryptic lyrics, such as \"She's the headlights I'm the deer\" or \"Did I cross the line?\". Eilish later changed her profile picture to a \"blue circle\" and shared another image with the caption saying \"Do you know how to bend?\". Eilish added her followers to an Instagram feature that lets limited accounts see exclusive stories, called \"Close Friends\". The post features a \"lo-fi\" image showcasing the artist's hand, and an image of her new midriff tattoo.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Rio Cachoeira is an approximately 54 km northern tributary of the Bay of Antonina in the southeast of the Brazilian state of Paraná.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Portuguese term Cachoeira translates to Waterfall in English.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Rio Cachoeira's catchment area is located in the Serra do Mar and in the Coastal Plain of Paraná.\n\n\n=== Course ===\nIts source is located in the municipality of Antonina at an elevation of 1,282 m, about 25 km north of the main town. It is situated on the main ridge of the Serra do Mar between Pico Capivari (IV) and Pico Guaricana (1,550 m) on its northern slope. About 6 km away to the south is the Pico Paraná, the highest mountain in Paraná at 1,877 m.\nThe river initially flows northward. After about one kilometer and a descent of 400 meters, it turns east. It now loses about 600 meters in elevation over approximately seven kilometers, until it turns south towards the coastal plain. It flows into the Bay of Antonina, an offshoot of the Bay of Paranaguá. It is approximately 54 km long.\n\n\n=== Tributaries ===\nfrom the right, all three rivers originate on the slopes of Pico Paraná: \n\nRio Cotia (8 km),\nRio Saci (6 km),\nDischarge from the Governador Pedro Viriato Parigot de Souza Power Plant\nRio Mergulhão (13 km)\nfrom the left: \n\nRio São Sebastião (9 km)\nRio Água Branca (6 km)\nRio Pequeno (with headstream Rio Guarujá: 28 km)\n\n\n=== Municipalities in the catchment area ===\nThe Rio Cachoeira flows entirely within the municipality of Antonina.\n\n\n== Hydroelectric Power Plant ==\nBelow the confluence of the Rio Saci, already in the coastal plain, the Rio Cachoeira receives the water of the Rio Capivari, which is used for electricity generation at the Usina Hidrelétrica Governador Pedro Viriato Parigot de Souza. For this purpose, the water is dammed at an elevation of 840 m by a 58 m high and 370 m long earth dam. The reservoir is located on the BR-116 about 50 km northeast of Curitiba towards São Paulo. The water is channeled through a 15.4 km long tunnel that was drilled through the rock mass of the Serra do Mar. In the 1.1 km long pressure pipe with a diameter of 3 m, the water is directed at a speed of 426 km/h into the turbines, generating a power output of 260 MW.\nThe hydroelectric power plant is located near the village of Cachoeira de Cima in the municipality of Antonina. Its discharge doubles the water volume of the Rio Cachoeira. It was originally named Capivari-Cachoeira after the two affected rivers. Upon completion, it was named after Pedro Viriato Parigot de Sousa, who served as the Governor of Paraná between 1971 and 1973 and was also the president of Copel in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a small tree, growing up to 8 meters tall.\nIt grows from 50 to 950 meters elevation on Socorro. At high elevations it is the dominant canopy tree in Ilex socorrensis forest. Other forest canopy trees include Guettarda insularis, Sideroxylon socorrense, and Psidium oligospermum. At middle elevations it grows in dry forest and shrubland. The population is small, estimated at 2,500 mature individuals. It is threatened by habitat loss, mostly from overgrazing by introduced sheep, cattle, and goats, which destroys native vegetation and accelerates soil erosion.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a member of the Standing Committee of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZhang was born into a family that owned a pharmacy in Chaoyi County (now Zhaoyi Town), Shaanxi, in October 1889. At the age of 18, he attended Hongdao Academy, one of the earliest modern schools established in Shaanxi, where he studied alongside Wu Mi. One year later, he led and organized a student movement, drove away two Japanese teachers, and was forced to flee to Shanghai. He joined the Tongmenghui and took part in the Xinhai Revolution. In 1913, he pursued advanced studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1919.\nZhang returned to China in 1925 and successively worked as director of the International Publication Exchange Bureau, director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and professor at National Central University. In August 1929, he was recruited as a professor in the Department of Political Science, Tsinghua University.\nIn June 1949, Zhang was appointed as deputy director of the newly established North China Higher Education Commission. On 21 June 1949, during the first meeting of the preparatory committee for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), when discussing the name of the new China, he proposed using the name \"People's Republic of China\". On September 27, the first plenary session of the CPPCC adopted the new name proposed by him and included it in the Common Program of the CPPCC. In December 1949, he became president of the Chinese People's Diplomatic Association, in which he made positive contributions in promoting the establishment of diplomatic relations between China, France, and Japan. In September 1952, he succeeded Ma Xulun as minister of education. During his term in office, he presided over patriotic education, civic education, and labor education, improved the curriculum and school system, promoted students to speak Mandarin, and formulated the \"Code of Conduct for Primary School Students\". In 1956, at a \"study conference\", he  emphasized that \"shouting 'Long live' is the decline of human civilization.\" (喊‘万岁’，这是人类文明的堕落). In 1957, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched the \"Rectification Movement\", he gave Mao Zedong an evaluation: \"Great achievements, eager for quick success, disdainful of the past, superstitious about the future.\" (好大喜功，急功近利，鄙视既往，迷信将来) He also said: \"Nowadays, it seems that everything starts after liberation of China. In the past, everything was feudal, and before Karl Marx was born, humanity had no culture.\" Although Mao was dissatisfied with Zhang's criticism, but he believed that Zhang was a good person. \nIn April 1959, he was chosen as director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, and served until 1968.\nIn August 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, Zhang was protected by Zhou Enlai and did not face political persecution.\nZhang died in Beijing on 18 July 1973, at the age of 84.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n 张奚若文集 [Collected Works of Zhang Xiruo] (in Chinese).

        "content": "DDR von unten (sometimes called eNDe or DDR von unten/eNDe; English: GDR from below) was a split LP by two East German punk bands, Zwitschermaschine and Schleim-Keim. The album was smuggled from the GDR to West Berlin. Released in 1983 by the independent label Aggressive Rockproduktionen, it is considered the first punk album in the GDR, but was only officially released in the West. For years it was the only release of its kind. The production of the album kept the Ministry for State Security busy for several years, with the band Schleim-Keim almost exclusively targeted for repression. Two unofficial collaborators (IM) were involved in its creation, including the then highly regarded alternative writer Sascha Anderson.\n\n\n== History of its creation ==\nDimitri Hegemann, from the West Berlin city magazine tip, met the band Rosa Extra at an East Berlin party in 1982. He was surprised to discover a counterculture in the GDR and this inspired him to produce records in the West. Hegemann visited Karl-Ulrich Walterbach from Aggressive Rockproduktionen and successfully convinced him of the idea. As Hegemann had an entry permit to East Berlin, he was able to follow the process of creating the album. However, since Rosa Extra could not complete the project independently and required assistance, they approached Sascha Anderson. As a freelance writer, he had many connections in intellectual and artistic circles critical of the GDR regime. His own band, Zwitschermaschine, eventually became the second group to participate in the album, which was now planned as a split release. Sascha Anderson wrote an essay reflecting the zeitgeist of the GDR underground and his group. The essay was later published in the inlay. Sören \"Egon\" Naumann, the driver and technician familiar with recording techniques, was included in the plan and agreed to produce the songs. They decided to hire another band as well, and contacts were made with Dieter \"Otze\" Ehrlich from Schleim-Keim. In contrast to Zwitschermaschine and Rosa Extra, this angry and aggressive band would complement the more artistic style of the two bands.\nIn early 1983, Anderson discovered a home studio in Hermsdorf near Dresden where the songs could be recorded. The studio was set up by Andeck Baumgärtel, a blues musician with the group Mustang, on the ground floor of his home, and was equipped with a drum kit from the Czech brand Amati. However, the studio technology was not optimal or up to date. In particular, the mixing console from Vermona was faulty and the plastic microphones used to record the drums often failed. The RFT vocal microphone was the only up-to-date equipment used for the recordings. The recordings were made using magnetic tapes from ORWO on Tesla tape machines over a weekend in January 1983.\n\nThe initial recording session featured Rosa Extra, who brought a genuine Casio synthesiser - a rarity in the GDR at the time. The entire rehearsal was recorded and archived for later use. The following day, Schleim-Keim, who had a traditional punk line-up (guitar, bass, drums), played. They performed a fast and straightforward punk style that focused primarily on intensity. Dieter Ehrlich played the drums and provided vocals, Klaus played the guitar, and Andreas Deubach played bass. Zwitschermaschine were the final act to perform. The band consisted of Sascha Anderson, Cornelia Schleime, and Michael Rom on vocals, Lothar Fiedler on guitar, Matthias Zeidler on bass, and Wolfgang Grossmann on drums. Volker Palma played violin and trombone.\nAfter the recordings were finished, the Ministry for State Security (MfS) visited Günther Spalda from Rosa Extra. This was not a coincidence, as the MfS had learned about the record's production through unofficial collaborators (IMs) Sascha Anderson and Sören Naumann. The MfS threatened the group with five to ten years in prison if they did not surrender the tape with their recordings. The group, which included freelance writers Bert Papenfuß-Gorek and Stefan Döring, was trying to be classified by the state at the time. In the GDR, the only way to be recognised as a professional musician, make recordings, and give official performances was to be classified by a committee of SED officials, music journalists, musicologists, and prominent musicians. After lengthy consultation, the members decided to hand over the master tape to the MfS. The band was later categorised under the name Hard Pop.\nThese recent developments resulted in Schleim-Keim being allocated an entire LP side instead of just half. To ensure anonymity, Schleim-Keim opted to use an alias for the recordings. It was proposed to keep the \"SK\" as an abbreviation, so that, after \"Salz-Kartoffel\" (English: salt-potato), they agreed on calling themselves \"Sau-Kerle\" (English: sow-guys).\nThe two remaining master tapes were given to Günther Fischer, a renowned composer for whom Anderson had written lyrics. Fischer transferred the recordings from the ORWO tapes to higher-quality magnetic tapes, as the quality was considered outdated in West Germany. Thanks to Anderson's connections with diplomats from West Berlin, the recordings eventually made it to the other side of the Wall. In West Berlin, Ralf Kerbach, a former member of Zwitschermaschine and now a citizen of the FRG, received the tape. It is still unclear whether Kerbach added another guitar track to the recordings of his former band. Karl-Ulrich Walterbach subsequently received the recordings and took care of their release.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe album was originally released in 1983 as an LP with the serial number AG 0019. The initial order quantity ranged from 1,500 to 4,000 copies, depending on the source.\nThe LP was titled DDR von unten (GDR from below), sometimes abbreviated as eNDe, which appears on both the front and back cover. While some speculated that the lettering eNDe was meant to evoke the abbreviation ND for Neues Deutschland, the SED party newspaper, some band members deny this. Instead, the release was intended to signify the end of Zwitschermaschine. It is certain that Sascha Anderson had been using the acrostic in various poems since 1982. He confirmed this version in his biography.\nThe record was never officially released in the GDR. Only a few copies managed to make it into the country. Sascha Anderson was able to smuggle three copies in by hiding them in the train's toilet. It is believed that Dieter Ehrlich obtained his copy from Anderson. Anderson had allegedly promised Ehrlich money for the production in advance but failed to deliver, leading Ehrlich to break into Anderson's house and steal 120 West Marks as well as the record. When Ehrlich was arrested, his mother hid the record from the MfS. The recording circulated in the GDR on a cassette tape, featuring Zwitschermaschine on the A-side and Schleim-Keim on the B-side.\n\n\n== Re-release ==\n\nThe complete record has never been re-released, so there is no CD version available. However, Sascha Anderson did use some of the recordings for another split release with his group Fabrik titled \"Alles Geld der Welt kostet Geld\" (1998) in CD format. Additionally, the Schleime composition \"geh übern fluß\" was included in the compilation for the book Spannung. Leistung. Widerstand. Magnetbanduntergrund DDR 1979–1990.\nThe songs on the Schleim-Keim side were released in different versions on the group's later recordings. Frankreich was re-recorded as Faustrecht and Haushaltsgeräte became Karnickel. Only the two titles Ende and Alles ist rot were exclusively reserved for DDR von unten. As part of the re-release of Schleim-Keim's recordings on Höhnie Records, their tracks were added as a limited EP to the vinyl version of the album Nichts Gewonnen Nichts Verloren Vol. 1 - Die Stotterheim-Tapes 1984–87 (2000). The order of the tracks was rearranged and relabeled with their current song names.\n\n\n== Cover design ==\nThe front cover is part of Kerbach's Totenreklame-Zyklus a series of images he used for the poetry collection totenreklame, eine Reise by Sascha Anderson. Although the picture, like the other illustrations in this cycle, was created during a 7,000-kilometre journey through the GDR, it was not published in the collection of poems. The cover depicts an anthropomorphic animal figure striking a bulky, rectangular object with a key-shaped object. The chosen background is a household accounts page in grey with a diagonally arranged white field. The text \"DDR von unten\" is written below with the subtitle \"Schallplatte mit 2 Gruppen und Textbeilage\". Below the picture is \"eNDe\". Cornelia Schleime illustrated the reverse side, featuring a drawing of a woman's upper body and head, as well as several unrecognisable objects arranged on a shelf. Schleime's drawing style is influenced by Kerbach's style. The background and signature eNDe remain unchanged. On page 2, there is an essay by Anderson titled \"Von einem Beteiligten\", where he pens his thoughts on the band's history in lowercase. Additionally, there is a statement by Karl-Ulrich Walterbach regarding the confiscation of the first Slime LP due to the songs \"Deutschland muß sterben\" and \"Bullenschweine\". Pages 1 and 4 feature handwritten song lyrics from both groups on scraps of torn-out writing pad pages.\n\n\n== Music style and lyrics ==\n\nAt the time of recording, Zwitschermaschine was already disbanding. Following Ralf Kerbach's departure, Sascha Anderson took over leadership of the group, so the pieces seemed to be a solo effort by him. Four out of the five lyrics were written by the artist. Only the arrangement borrowed from the original line-up of Kerbach, Schleime, and Rom. The song Alles oder nichts originated from a band session in the summer of 1982 at the Theater der Jungen Generation Dresden, with Kerbach on guitar. Geh über die Grenze and Jeder Satellit hat einen Killersatelliten were already published in 1982 in poem form in Sascha Anderson's collection of the same name, with illustrations by Ralf Kerbach. Musically, the pieces feature a strong disharmony, with rapid alternation between calm and aggressive passages. Volker Palma's trombone and violin parts are sparse and, like the rest of the music, largely lack a fixed rhythm. Borrowings from jazz lend the music a sound typical of art-punk. The lyrics are performed by the three singers as spoken word. In terms of style, the music is reminiscent of post-industrial bands like Einstürzende Neubauten, punk and no-wave artists such as Patti Smith and Lydia Lunch, and Krautrock bands like Can. The Stranglers also served as an inspiration.\n\nDie Aufnahmen der fertigen LP stellen eher eine Solopräsentation Andersonscher Lyrismen dar. So hatten wir nicht angefangen, aber dahin waren wir gekommen. Das war kein Punk mehr, das waren die überschäumenden Absonderungen eines Selbstdarstellers.\nFree Translation: The recordings of the finished LP are more of a solo presentation of Anderson's lyricism. We hadn't started out like that, but we had got there. This was no longer punk, these were the exuberant excretions of a self-promoter.\nSascha Anderson, on the other hand, described the collaboration as \"equal\" in a later interview. The lyrical texts deal with themes such as borders (Geh über die Grenze, Geh über'n Fluß) and consumption (Alles oder nichts und noch viel mehr). The satellite motif appears twice.\nThe B-side of the album presents a contrast. Schleim-Keim, also known as Sau-Kerle, play typical three-chord punk that prioritises speed and heaviness. The majority of the lyrics were written by Dieter Ehrlich, while the music was a joint effort. Ehrlich's vocals are dark and angry, with a Thuringian flavour. The lyrics mostly revolve around the chorus, with individual verses repeated multiple times. In contrast to the versions released later on CD and LP, the songs are much harder due to the poor production. Some of the lyrics are almost unintelligible. Songs like Untergrund ist Strategie, Scheiß Norm and Alles ist rot are not very subtle, but highly subversive and socially critical. Scheiß Norm deals with the compulsion to conform in the GDR, while Untergrund ist Strategie proposes the anarchist underground struggle as a solution. Ende, the only song to be rejected by the Ministry for State Security, criticises hypocrisy in the East. Haushaltsgeräte, on the other hand, is a lighthearted song in which the narrator imagines himself as a rabbit. Spione im Café portrays the widespread paranoia that existed in the GDR. Frankreich (later Faustrecht (rule of fist)) describes the widespread police violence and arbitrary arrests in the GDR in a veiled manner. (\"The cops catch you off the street because you're just dirt (...) They punch you in the face, for them you're just a lousy pig (...) They do what they want with you (...) Get you out of your bunk with your arse\", free translation).\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe State Security began monitoring the members of Schleim-Keim as soon as the recordings were completed. On 28 January 1983, the members were declared \"absent\". After about two months of surveillance, all three members were taken into custody on 29 March 1983 after long talks with their parents and superiors. Dieter Ehrlich was unemployed at the time. While Deubach and Klaus Ehrlich were released after a few days, Dieter Ehrlich remained in custody for four weeks, two of which were spent in solitary confinement. The lyrics to Ende drew the attention of the state security service due to the lines \"I'm no longer ashamed of my homeland, the GDR (...) I'm through with it / Careerists and fascists and only false communists\" (free translation). The other song lyrics were described as:\n\nsehr primitiv gestaltete Entäußerungen einer pessimistischen Lebenshaltung mit anarchistischen Zügen, allgemeiner Unzufriedenheit und einer grundsätzlichen Opposition gegenüber der staatlichen Ordnung.\nFree translation: very primitive expressions of a pessimistic attitude to life with anarchistic traits, general dissatisfaction and a fundamental opposition to the state order.The group's statements were not taken seriously enough, particularly as the MfS believed that \"primitive personalities\" were involved. According to Ehrlich's own statements during the interrogations, the texts referred to social conditions in South Africa. The interrogators were therefore unable to incriminate him. Nonetheless, the offence of §219 of the East German Criminal Code (unlawful communication) remained. Ehrlich was subjected to pressure through solitary confinement and the threat of a severe sentence. However, after a month, he was released without punishment and handed over to his mother. All confiscated items were returned to him. It is worth noting that he was listed as an 'unofficial criminal police employee for operational tasks' (IKMO) under the code name 'Richard'. For a year and a half, Ehrlich reported on the punk movement to the MfS in exchange for small sums of money and cigarettes. Despite being repeatedly arrested for short periods until the end of the GDR, he continued to provide information. Dimitri Hegemann, who initiated the record, was banned from entering the GDR and was even prohibited from using the transit route to West Germany for a while.\nAlthough Schleim-Keim was exclusively affected by state repression, Zwitschermaschine was completely spared due to the MfS's fear of exposing its IM Anderson. Sascha Anderson's spying services only became public knowledge in the early 1990s. In his Büchner Prize speech in 1991, Wolf Biermann gave him the nickname \"Schwätzer Sascha Arschloch\" (chatterbox Sascha arsehole), which subsequently became widely known.\n\nCornelia Schleime attempted to leave East Germany by using her film productions and Zwitschermaschine to provoke the MfS. However, she was only able to leave the country in 1984 after threatening a hunger strike and having a phone conversation with Ralf Kerbach, which was intercepted by the MfS. Therefore, her involvement with Zwitschermaschine was only a small part of her journey out of the country.\n\nIch dachte immer, wenn wir dieses Zeug machen, treibt es meine Ausreise weiter voran, denn ich stellte ja etliche Anträge. Mich wunderte nur, wie glatt alles lief. Aber vielleicht hatten wir dies ja Anderson zu verdanken, von dem wir damals nicht wussten, dass er als IM auf uns angesetzt war. \nFree translation: I always thought that if we did this stuff, it would push my departure forward, because I submitted several applications. I was just amazed at how smoothly everything went. But maybe we had Anderson to thank for that, who we didn't realise at the time was an IM on us.She only found out that a best friend at the time had been spying on her for the MfS for years when the \"Gauck Office\" inspected her files in 1991. According to her, these years of unwanted \"undressing\" at least gave her the ability to develop an \"open relationship\" to life. She wrote about her story with Anderson in 2008 in the novel Weit fort.\n\n\n== Influence and impact ==\nUntil the Peaceful Revolution in 1989, this split LP was one of only four albums that made it over the Iron Curtain, and it remains one of the few examples of musical underground and resistance in the GDR. The other three, although not quite as influential, were the album Made in the GDR by L'Attentat, the compilation Live in Paradise (1985), and the LP panem et circensis (1986) by the Weimar punk band Der Rest (KG Rest). It was only years later that \"the other bands\" such as Die Skeptiker, Müllstation, and Feeling B became known. This was mainly because most of the bands did not have a musician's license and were therefore not allowed to play or release their songs on recordings.\nThe LP challenged the state's recording monopoly and demonstrated that a counter-movement was possible despite major technical restrictions and rigid treatment of musicians in the East. In addition to the Amiga record label, a cassette culture emerged with a few recordings that were shared and sold. Tape trading allowed for circumvention of state repression and increased accessibility to music.\nIn 1988, individual tracks from the B-side were aired on Radio Glasnost, a program organized by GDR opposition activists on the West Berlin alternative station Radio 100.\nAlthough DDR von unten was never officially released in the GDR, the record spread through the cassette market. However, the GDR punks were mainly interested in the Sau-Kerle side, as it was common knowledge that the Erfurt band Schleim-Keim was behind it. This significantly increased Schleim-Keim's popularity in the East German punk scene. By 1991, Schleim-Keim had also become a well-known name in reunified Germany. Zwitschermaschine did not receive much support from either side. In an interview with Ox in August/September 2007, Cornelia Schleime confirmed that Dieter \"Otze\" Ehrlich was considered the \"only punk rock star in the GDR\":\n\nAus dem Bauch heraus sehe ich das genauso. So richtig gut kannten wir sie am Anfang nicht, aber da wir so gegensätzlich waren, waren wir dann doch von einander angezogen. (…) Zirkelten wir im Intellektuellen, rasten sie drauf los. Sie waren unglaublich echt und ganz sympathische Kerle. Auch waren sie nicht eitel, denn es ging ihnen einzig und allein um die Musik. Eitelkeiten waren sonst bei allen übrigen Bands zu beobachten. Die SCHLEIM-KEIMs haben wirklich mit dem Hammer aus der DDR-Flagge die Sichel zerkloppt.\nFree translation: My gut feeling is the same. We didn't really know them that well at first, but because we were such opposites, we were attracted to each other. (...) When we circled around the intellectuals, they went crazy. They were incredibly genuine and very likeable guys. They weren't vain either, because they were only interested in the music. Vanity could otherwise be observed in all the other bands. The SCHLEIM-KEIMs really smashed the sickle out of the GDR flag with its hammer.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBoehlke, Michael; Gericke, Henryk, eds. (2007).

        "content": "Cloghan Point is an oil terminal located in Belfast Lough, near the town of Whitehead, County Antrim, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe terminal was originally built by Northern Ireland Electricity in 1979 to supply the nearby Kilroot and Ballylumford power stations.\nThe facility was constructed as an import, storage and distribution hub for Heavy Fuel Oil. However, following the installation of a new HFO pipeline from the terminal directly to Kilroot power station in 2008, the storage facility became effectively redundant.\nThe storage facility, which is capable of storing 126,000 tonnes of Heavy Fuel Oil is currently owned by the Republic of Ireland's National Oil Reserves Agency, and stores part of Ireland's strategic fuel reserve.\nThe jetty can accommodate tankers up to 120,000 tonnes and stretches 1,225m into Belfast Lough.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nCloughan Point was constructed and opened under the ownership of Northern Ireland Electricity in 1979. Ownership was transferred to LCC Group in 2017.\n\n\n== Campaign against expansion ==\nLCC Group, the site's current owners annpounced plans to develop the facility into a terminal for the importation and distribution of Heavil Fuel Oil into Northern Ireland. This has been met with resistance from local residents  and Translink, Northern Ireland's public transport operator who have stated they belive it would interfere with their plans to electrify the nearby Larne-Belfast railway line.\n\n\n== References ==",

The historic stone house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 10, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nAccording to the nomination form, the house was built by a member of the Demarest family in the early 19th century based on architectural evidence. Charles Newcomb made changes to the house during the 1860s. His son-in-law, John S. Lyle, bought the house in 1912.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Largo do Arouche, also known as Flower Square (Portuguese: Praça das Flores) or Flower Market (Mercado das Flores), is located in the República district, in the central region of the city of São Paulo. It represents a center of diversity, as it has been occupied by LGBTQIAP+ social groups since the 1940s, an occupation that resisted the military dictatorship in the fight for the right to sexual and gender diversity.\nIt houses several florists who set up shop after the existing stalls in República Square were removed by Mayor Armando de Arruda Pereira around 1914. During the 1900s, it housed the Arouche Free Fair, which was created during the crisis in the supply of fruit and vegetable products and closed in 1954. The current name refers to Lieutenant General José Arouche de Toledo Rendon, the first director of the Law School of the University of São Paulo and the Botanical Garden. It has been called Largo do Ouvidor, Largo da Artilharia and Alexandre Herculano Square.\nThe place became nationally known after the sitcom Sai de Baixo, produced by TV Globo, was launched. The series, shown between 1996 and 2002, portrayed humorous situations that took place in a fictitious building located in Largo do Arouche.\n\n\n== History ==\nAround 1820, Largo do Arouche served as a military exercise ground that stretched as far as the current República Square. It is named after Lieutenant General José Arouche de Toledo Rendon, who owned a large part of the central area of the city of São Paulo, which included the current Largo do Arouche and República Square. In 1881, following Arouche's request, the São Paulo City Council agreed to clear and flatten the area in order to \"discipline the militiamen by brigades\" and change its name to Milicianos Square.\nThe space between the streets Jaguaribe and Arouche, considered the lower part, received several names, such as da Alegria Square and Legião Square. In 1865, it was renamed Campo do Arouche, which lasted until 1910, when Municipal Law No. 1,312 changed it to Alexandre Herculano Square. Three years later, Largo do Arouche became the definitive name for the whole area. In 1953, it was called the Arouche Flower Market. The upper part, formerly the Artillery Square, also changed its name to Largo do Arouche. It is composed of Jaguaribe, Amaral Gurgel and Arouche streets, and Duque de Caxias Avenue. On the opposite side is Vieira de Carvalho Avenue.\n\n\n=== LGBTQIA+ stronghold ===\nThe area is mainly known for the presence of the LGBTQIA+ community, including nightclubs, stores, social centers and meeting points for meetings and events. According to the archives of the Caneca de Prata Bar, Largo do Arouche began to be frequented by city executives around the 1940s who were looking for more discreet places to meet men. The bar, founded in 1960, is frequented by LGBT+ people and is considered by important media outlets to be a symbol of resistance in favor of diversity.\nIn addition to the Caneca de Prata, there was the Freedom Nightclub and other bohemian places that became strongholds during the military dictatorship. During police raids, in which LGBT people were arrested for being who they were, these establishments sheltered the individuals until the police left the place.\nIn the 1980s, Largo do Arouche was the scene of a crackdown on transvestites who circulated in the area on the grounds of fighting AIDS. The action, undertaken by the police, was called Operation Tarantula. On June 28, 2015, seven flags were installed in honor of LGBT Pride Day. Later that year, the São Paulo City Hall, as part of the actions of the Management Goals Program, installed the LGBT Citizenship Center on Arouche Street.\n\n\n=== Revitalization ===\n\nIn May 2019, São Paulo City Hall began work on revitalizing Largo do Arouche, which included paving and leveling the floor, and installing new benches, drinking fountains and new lampposts. There were also plans to build kiosks and a vegetable garden. The change worried the Public Prosecutor's Office, which managed to halt the work pointing out a possible de-characterization of the site. The project was revised and the work was subsequently cleared, as there was no risk of environmental or urban damage. Largo do Arouche was reopened in March 2020.\n\n\n=== Historic buildings ===\nThe site houses important sculptures by renowned artists, such as: The Girl and the Calf, a work by sculptor Luís Christophe, commissioned by Mayor Raimundo Duprat; the bust of Afonso d'Escragnolle Taunay, one of Brazil's greatest historians, designed by artist Claude Dunin; and Maternal Love, a sculpture featuring a dog and her puppy made by Frenchman Louis Eugéne Virion and acquired in the 1910s. The São Paulo Academy of Letters, based in Largo do Arouche, honored the immortal Aureliano Leite with a bust made by Luís Morrone in the area inaugurated in 1979, two years after his death.\nIn addition to political resistance and festivities, Largo do Arouche is also a stronghold for thrift stores, known for providing access to fashion at lower prices than the big stores.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\nLargo São Bento\nLargo de São Francisco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Largo do Arouche at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Rabbi Joseph Schwarz (Hebrew: יהו ש שוורר; born on October 22, 1804, in Raft; died on February 5, 1865, in Jerusalem) was a Jewish geographer, Palestine explorer and rabbi.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nJoseph Schwarz was born in the Jewish ghetto in Raft, the Judenberg. He was the middle of the three sons of Mendel Schwarz, a main sponsor of the elementary school in Raft. The Schwarz family descended from one of the founders of the Jewish community Floss, namely from Eisik Feifas from Neustadt an der Waldnaab. Joseph's brothers were Samuel Schwarz and Hajum Schwarz. Hajum Schwarz was the father of Israel Schwarz, who later edited the main work of his uncle Joseph Schwarz.\nEven in his childhood, Schwarz developed an affection for the rabbinical profession. He first studied the Talmud in Schwabach with Rabbi Abraham Wechsler, who was district rabbi in the Schwabach District Rabbinate founded in 1813 from 1820 to 1850. In 1823 he worked as an accountant for the landowner and rabbi Mendel Rosenbaum in Unterzell near Würzburg.\nThen he continued his studies for five years at the university and at the Yeshiva in Würzburg, where his older brother Samuel was already studying. The Yeshiva in Würzburg, then led by Rabbi Abraham Bing, tended more towards Orthodox Judaism than towards reform Judaism, which emerged at the beginning of the 19th century. \"A large number of students flocked to Würzburg [...] to listen to his learned words. Among the most important were the later Altona Chief Rabbi Jakob Ettlinger, the later London chief rabbi Nathan [Marcus] Adler, the Hamburg Chacham Is.[aak] Bernays, R.[abbi] Elieser Bergmann and [...] Seligmann Bär Bamberger.\" In Würzburg, Schwarz also studied the geography of Palestine.\nAt that time he wrote a map of Palestine, which was published in three editions: Würzburg in 1829, Vienna in 1831, Trieste in 1832.\n\n\n== Trip to Palestine ==\nSince his earliest youth, Schwarz had the desire to research the history, geography, geology, flora and fauna of the Holy Land himself on the spot and to work out a correspondence between names, places and terms mentioned in the Bible, Talmud and Midrash with the existing conditions in the 19th century. At that time, there was only one significant Jewish work on this topic, namely kaftor wa-ferach (\"Knauf and Flower\") by Estori ha-Parchi (1282–1357), who had been traveling Palestine for seven years. Although there were some Christian works about Palestine, they were more interested in specifically Christian points of view.\nIn 1831 Schwarz left for Palestine. He first traveled to Vienna and from there to Hungary. In Hungary, Schwarz had to wait a whole year because cholera had broken out and the quarantine regulations (Contumaz cordon) prevented him from continuing his journey. From Hungary he travelled on to Fiume on the Mediterranean. There he was stuck for another half a year, because the Orient could not be traveled because of the danger of war. Finally, he reached Jaffa by ship via Smyrna and Rhodes, where he arrived on April 2, 1833. On April 19, 1833, he reached Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, Schwarz was taken in by the famous rabbinical family Luria. He married one of the daughters of the house of Luria.\nIn 1837, Schwarz was one of the co-founders and then the administrators of Kolel Holland und Deutschland (Kollel Hod), initiated by Lazarus Bergmann, who had made Aliyah in 1834.\n\n\n== Geographical studies in Palestine ==\nSchwarz was a member of the pious Watikin sect. As a result, his first work in Jerusalem was to observe from the Mount of Olives the exact times of sunrise and sunset for each day of the year. The time of sunrise and sunset determines the time for the Watikin's Shma Yisrael prayer. This work was published in Jerusalem in 1843 under the title Tvu'ot Hashemesh (άבואות השמש The Cycles of the Sun).\nSchwarz traveled to Palestine for 15 years at his own expense and explored its geography. A thorough knowledge of the local languages helped him in this arduous and often dangerous undertaking. He published the results of these trips in his book Tvu'ot Ha'aretz (άבואות הארר), which was published in Hebrew in Jerusalem in 1845.\nIn 1849 Schwarz went to the US and took care of the translation and publication of this book there. In addition, he collected donations as a Meshullach for the Kollel Hod. The book was translated into English by Isaac Leeser and published in 1850 under the title A descriptive geography and brief historical sketch of Palestine, by Rabbi Joseph Schwarz, for sixteen years a resident in the holy land. The costs of the publication were borne by the publisher A. Hart.\nFrom the US, Schwarz travelled via London to Germany, where he supervised the translation into German and the publication of his book. In 1852, his book, under the title Das heilige Land: Nach seiner ehemaligen und jetzt geographischen Beschaffenheit was published by the publishing house of the Hebrew antiquarian bookstore of I. Kaufmann, Frankfurt am Main. \nThe book contains geographical studies that show the names of localities, mountains, countries, rivers, etc., found in the Bible, Talmud and Midrash, not only in Palestine, but also in its surroundings, for example, in Lebanon, which was inhabited in the 19th century. Assign common names in the XIX century. In addition, it also contains explanations of the names of peoples; explanations of the animal kingdom, plant kingdom, mineral kingdom and climate; descriptions of the liturgical, religious and social customs of the Jews in Jerusalem; various legends and sketches on the history of the Jews in Palestine; and descriptions of the Arab population of Jerusalem. At the end of the book there is a detailed register of all occurring place names and other terms in German and Hebrew, a picture of Jerusalem and a map of Palestine.\nAfter 1852, Schwarz returned to Jerusalem. There he continued his studies of the rabbinic scriptures and Kabbalah, and joined the Kabbalistic association Beth-El.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hazan Caves is a hiding complex dated to the Bar Kokhba revolt period, located in the Shephelah just west of Bnei Dekalim. The site's name derives from the Arabic word khazana (coffer, treasure). This is the how the Arab villagers in the area called the site, which was looted by antiquities robbers many years ago. \nThe complex consists of karst caves, rock-cut cavities, underground rock-cu agricultural facilities and water cisterns connected to each other by underground tunnels and burrows. The site was discovered in 1979 by the eldest son of Moshav Amatzia - Ametzia Aboderam who was killed in duty as a team commander in the 35th Paratroopers Brigade (Israel).\nIn 2021, the site was declared as a national park and work began in order to make the site accessible to the public. \n\n\n== Archeology ==\n\nThe site was excavated in 1983 by archaeologists Shlomo Godovich and Gideon Avni. They discovered that the underground complex includes 35 cavities, pits, tunnels, halls, agricultural facilities, storage rooms and hiding places, with a total length of about 220 meters, in an area that covers about 650 square meters.\nThe place was inhabited from the end of the Second Temple period until the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt, as well as during the Byzantine period until the early Arab period. During those time periods the settlement above the ground, made use of the underground cavities for various uses such as storage and hiding. \nDuring the Bar-Kokhba revolt the underground cavities were expanded, connected and adapted for an extended stay. Gathering and guarding centers, hiding rooms, ventilation shafts and underground agricultural-industrial facilities such as an oil press were also installed, as well as niches for oil candles that were curved along the walls.\nIn the center of the complex are two bell shaped caves and a columbarium, which was integrated by the underground complex beneath the settlement. Four underground cavities were used as storage rooms. The floor of the storage rooms were carved with a pattern of round sockets (about 150 sockets on average per room) and in one of them an intact oil jugs were found. The ingenuity of the builders is expressed by the fact that they were built with a very gentle slope, with small channels connecting the sockets leading to a cistern, so that if a jug cracked, its liquid content would not be lost as it will flow and get collected in the cistern.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The General Assembly was the bicameral parliament of the Empire of Brazil. Article 14 of the Imperial Constitution established the General Assembly, which consisted of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and the Senate (upper house).\nOnce the General Legislative Assembly had been convened, the first preparatory session of the Chamber of Deputies took place on April 29, 1826, and the opening session of the first legislature (joint meeting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Senators) took place on May 6 of the same year.\n\n\n== Assembly operations ==\n\nThe Constitution already expressly provided the possibility of the two chambers meeting together. The first of these meetings was for the swearing in of the Emperor, as well as the Regents, when this was the case, due to the monarch being underage or interdicted. The election of the Regent was also provided. Another possibility was the annual opening and closing sessions of the General Assembly, called imperial because of the Emperor's attendance. Finally, there would be a meeting of both Chambers when there was a disagreement over a proposition.\n\n\n== Elections and length of term ==\n\nSenators and Deputies were elected indirectly until the electoral reform of 1881, when they were elected directly. The Senators were chosen in a direct election in which those voted for made up a triple list and from this the Emperor, as determined by the Brazilian Constitution of 1824, appointed one of the 3 who would have a lifetime mandate. The Deputies were elected by the electoral Parishes and had a 3-year term.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Japanese invasion of Zamboanga took place in March 1942 as part of Mindanao siege during Japanese campaign to invade the Philippines in December 1941 to May 1942.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn December 25, 1941, after the capture of Davao City, Sakaguchi Detachment invaded Jolo, Sulu in preparation of its invasion of Borneo in Dutch East Indies. Japanese did not attempt another landing in main Mindanao until April 1942 where massive reinforcement landed in Central West Coast area and Northern Mindanao.\n\n\n=== Zamboanga Sector ===\nZamboanga peninsula was initially under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William F. Dalton and Provisional Battalion, 43rd US Infantry under Major Allen Peck and a PC Company was the only combat unit it has. Their main mission is to guard the Wolfe Air Field until its expansion is completed as US Far East Air Force considered as one of B17 Heavy Bomber based.\nIn November 1941 1st Battalion, 102nd Infantry (PA) arrived from Davao for the refresher training course. In March when Mindanao Force was established, General Sharp the force commander ordered Colonel Dalton and Major Peck's Philippine Scout Battalion to transfer to Lake Pinamaloy in Bukidnon to established an Infantry and Artillery school which Philippine Scouts of Major Peck will serve as instructors.\nColonel Wilson took over the command of the sector and Mindanao Force headquarters sent Major Lawrence Prichard to serve as his executive. Preparation was intensified and in January 1942 a provisional battalion composed of school boys was organized under the command of Major Jose D. Garcia of the Philippine Army. A PC Company under Major Juan Crisologo guard the interior of the city and also in charge of the Japanese internees.\n\n\n=== Combat Narratives ===\nOn February 26, 1942, Japanese Reconnaissance Seaplanes from Davao base started to do reconnaissance in Zamboanga, bombed defending troops position. On the following day February 27, a report reached Colonel Wilson's headquarters in Zamboanga City of Task forces converging to the city from Davao, Jolo, and from the North. Demolition charges was laid to the bridges and destruction of Petitt Barracks was executed by Major R.D Winne to avoid capture of them by the Japanese. Colonel Wilson ordered the two battalions to their battle positions. At 0240 hours invasion force arrived off Zamboanga, and the land combat units were landed.\nOverall command of the invasion force was under Vice Admiral Fugiyama Rokuzo commander of 3rd Southern Expeditionary Fleet. Landing force is under Rear Admiral Irifune Naosaburo but handed it over to Lieutenant (Navy) Yamada after a week and left for Davao. With no means of stopping the Japanese from landing, General Sharp ordered Colonel Wilson to the hills and fight as guerilla. On March 2, 1942, Colonel Wilson's troops counterattacked but with Naval and seaplanes they were repulsed. 1st Battalion, 102nd Infantry who came from Davao whose training was cut short and officers lack of leadership quality who has been not so keen in fighting and dying in Zamboanga. In contrast the Provisional Battalion, 106th Infantry under Major Jose D. Garcia who came mostly from Zamboanga had a good conduct of themselves being more loyal and tenacious among both officers and men being Zamboangans.\nMajor Juan Crisologo commander of PC units and Major Tremain the Force Surgeon raided the city for supplies and medicines. Which caught the Japanese by surprised and made them confused. The Filipinos attacked them frontal with rifles and Thompson submachineguns, machinegun nests are knockout with grenades before they were stopped by well placed machinegun nest. Major Crisologo and Tremaine decided to withdraw at dawn as Japanese alertness waned.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Japanese gained in control of the waterfront of Zamboanga City and Wolfe Field. Japanese objective is just to secure Zamboanga City and not to chase the Fil-American force eastward to the peninsula. Japanese able to free their interned citizens in Zamboanga and choke up the western coast of any transports from and to Luzon dooming the Luzon Force in Bataan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== See Also ===\nVisayas-Mindanao Force\nMindanao Force\n101st Infantry Division\n102nd Infantry Regiment\n\n\n=== External links ===\nThere were others, Unpublished papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington, CO 61st Field Artillery\nBrief History of 101st Division, Philippine Army, Primitivo Catalan, Office of the Military History, Armed Forces of the Philippines\nChronology of Japanese landing in Zamboanga",

        "content": "Meisel Music is a German independent music publishing group based in Berlin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was originally founded in 1926 by the award-winning German operetta and film composer Will Meisel as Edition Meisel & Co. GmbH. The company experienced early success with victories in the German song contest in 1931 and 1932. In 1933 the Meisel catalog, composed almost entirely of songs by Jewish composers and lyricists, was decimated in the wake of Adolph Hitler's new dictatorship, with only seven titles remaining. Edition Meisel & Co. published works by artists such as Walter Kollo, Fred Raymond and Gerhard Winkler. Will Meisel continued to grow the business by actively promoting the publisher's titles with dance orchestra musicians at all major venues, and involving the company in pop festivals and the theater community.\nDuring World War II the company's offices were twice destroyed by bombs and rebuilt, with the company eventually establishing new offices at Wittelsbacherstrasse 18 in West Berlin in 1946.\nIn 1960, Will Meisel's sons Peter and Thomas (1940–2014), joined the company and founded Edition Intro Meisel, and Will Meisel withdrew from the publishing house in 1962. Under Peter and Thomas' leadership, very successful titles from German pop music were published, including titles by Christian Bruhn, Frank Farian (including all titles by Boney M.), Gunter Gabriel and Drafi Deutscher. The Meisel brothers also focused on producing and recording, and established the Hansa Tonstudio recording studios and Hansa Records.\nIn 1984, Peter Meisel sold his shares of the company to Will Meisel. In 1985, after a decline in sales both domestically and internationally, Hansa Records was purchased by Bertelsmann Music Group, who merged them with several other labels like Ariola-Eurodisc to form BMG Berlin Musik GmbH/BMG-Ariola. The Meisel Music group later established the Monopol label, through which works by Helga Hahnemann, Max Raabe and the Palastorchester and the Schöneberg Boys' Choir have been published.\nIn 1998, Sven Meisel (1966–2016) became the third generation managing director of the Meisel music publishers, a position he held until his death on January 6, 2016. He was succeeded by his wife, Kirsten.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHansa Tonstudio\nHansa Records\n\n\n== References ==",

Kammies was then supposed to play the 2017 COSAFA U-20 Cup as well, but Ajax Cape Town declined to release him for international duty as he instead made his Premier Division debut in December 2017.\nKammies later played for Cape Umoya United before that club was sold to Venda, and he instead joined Cape Town All Stars. He was brought to Chippa United in the summer of 2022 as a part of a large influx of new players, with 16 signings being announced together.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jean Baptiste Brevelle (French: Jean Baptiste Brevel) was a Parisian-born trader, explorer, and one of the first soldiers garrisoned at Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches in present-day Natchitoches, Louisiana and Le Poste des Cadodaquious in Texas.\n\n\n== Explorer of French Louisiana ==\nBrevelle arrived in French Louisiana during the construction of Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches in 1719. Commandant Claude Charles du Tisné had arrived to the outpost just a few years earlier to convert the 2 huts built in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis into a fortified post on Red River of the South to establish France's claims to the region and to prevent the Spanish forces in the province of Texas from advancing across the border.Brevelle's military and trade assignments took them to various Native American, Spanish and French settlements throughout present-day Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma including Le Poste des Cadodaquious (also known as Le Posts des Nassonites) in Bowie and Red River County, Texas. This post was founded by Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe, and it is the first European settlement in northeast Texas. The post was garrisoned by a detachment from Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches. Brevelle traveled and mapped the areas along the Red, Sabine, and Trinity Rivers where he lived among and traded with the Natchitoches, Adai, Hasinai, Nasoni, Yatasi, Tawakoni and Kadohadacho Indians.\n\n\n== Family Life ==\nBrevelle took a young Native American slave from the Village of the Adays near the El Camino Real (English: The King’s Highway).  She was given the Christian name of Marie Anne des Cadeaux, named for Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mother and grandmother of Jesus. Brevelle so loved Anne that he obtained permission from Fort Commandant Louis Juchereau de St. Denis to marry her and free her from slavery. After the publication of three banns, they were married in 1736 in the Catholic Church in Natchitoches. Anne bore two children, who would become the first Creoles of Isle Brevelle.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBrevelle died in 1754 on Isle Brevelle near Bayou Brevelle. Fort St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches became the town of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase territory.Brevelle's son, Jean Baptiste Brevelle II, with his knowledge of various Caddo languages and customs, worked as the famed translator, arbitrator, explorer, and soldier for the French and Spanish crowns. For his service, he was issued a land grant of fertile farmland south of Natchitoches along the Cane River and Old River. The 30-mile long island is today known as Isle Brevelle. Dr. John Sibley, Indian Agent and council to Louisiana's first U.S. Governor, in 1804 reported to the U.S. Congress that the Isle Brevelle was named for its earliest settler, Jean Baptiste Brevelle II.\nThe former Brevelle Plantation (now Isle Brevelle) is home to the Cane River Creole National Historical Park and is the birthplace of Creole culture. In Louisiana, the term Creole is defined as native-born people of ethnic European background mixed with Native American and/or African. Brevelle's story and that of both of his Creole children are documented in the records of the Catholic Church and in interviews conducted by Indian Agent Dr. Sibley after the Louisiana Purchase which are on file in the American State Papers, Library of Congress, and the Annals of Congress.St. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church, Bayou Brevelle, and Isle Brevelle in Natchitoches Parish and Brevelle Lake in Red River County are named for this pioneer family.\"The Caddo left their names, art, and culture in Louisiana. Several colonial European families can claim Caddoan ancestors: Grappes, Brevelles, Balthazars, and others.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCane River (film)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana\n\n\n== References ==",

He was sent to study at Leuven University and went on to become subprior, lecturer in theology, prior, preacher, and provincial definitor. In 1573, during the Dutch Revolt, he was serving at the parish of Poppel when he was abducted by rebels and held captive at Geertruidenberg for six months. The commandant at Geertruidenberg, Jeronimus Tseraerts, initially refused to release Van Lierop in a prisoner exchange, threatening to hang him summarily instead. After Tseraerts's death at the hands of mutineers, Van Lierop was released unharmed. He returned to 's-Hertogenbosch, where he eventually died on 10 March 1621.\n\n\n== Writings ==\nTwo of Van Lierop's works survived in manuscript:\n\nDestructio Babylonis, seu tractatus de vitiis\nSermones de tempore et de sanctis\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Anderson was a Scottish tailor working in Edinburgh in the 1540s and 1550s. He made clothes for Margaret Douglas, Countess of Arran and her daughters. At this time, the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran was Regent or Governor of Scotland, and the treasurer's accounts include details of clothing bought for his family.\nOccasionally, Anderson travelled to Hamilton and Linlithgow for fittings and to complete garments for \"My Lady Governor\". Margaret, Countess of Hamilton had riding cloaks and \"wardygards\", a Scots language word for a \"safeguard\" riding skirt. Some of her garments were trimmed with fur supplied by John Craig. An embroiderer, John Cochran, carried out specialised work on cutting out satin sleeves and skirts.\n\nAn entry for tailoring work in February 1553 reads:Item to Jhone Andersoun tailyeour for making of this foresaid clethying viz tua gownnis of sating, ane goun of velvote, with paitlattis, hudis, skyrttis, slevis, gorgettis, furnessing of glaspis, & other necessars _ xxx s.Item, to John Anderson tailor for making of this foresaid clothing viz: two gowns of satin, a gown of velvet, with partlets, hoods, skirts, sleeves, gorgets, furnishing of clasps, & other necessities _ 30 shillings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Toto was the stage name of Swiss-born clown Armando Novello (October 27, 1888 – December 15, 1938), who worked extensively in American vaudeville shows.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nNovello was born in Geneva, Switzerland, according to most sources though he sometimes claimed that his birthplace was Hamburg.  His first name is sometimes given in error as \"Alfonso\" or \"Arnold\".  His father was an Italian horse trainer, and his mother was a German lion tamer.  He began circus work as a child contortionist, and in his teens trained as a jockey before returning to circus and theatre work in Europe.  He developed a clown act in which he would come on stage wearing oversized multicolored clothes and shoes, in a toy car that was far too small for him, together with a large suitcase and his small dog, Whiskey.  He toured the U.S. in 1911, and performed before the royal families of Germany and Russia before being stranded in Petrograd at the outbreak of the First World War.   \nSponsored by theatre manager and producer Charles Dillingham, he came to the U.S. in 1915 and appeared in the revue Hip! Hip! Hooray!.  He made his vaudeville debut in 1918 in San Francisco, and worked in silent movies under the direction of Hal Roach.  His films included Fire the Cook, An Enemy of Soap, and The Movie Dummy, all in 1918. In the 1920s he was a headline act at the New York Hippodrome and the Palace Theatre, toured widely in the U.S. and Canada, and appeared in New York in shows such as the Grand Street Follies of 1924.    \nHe largely retired from the stage in the 1930s, after a final command performance before King George V and Queen Mary in 1931.   He later ran an inn at Mamaroneck, New York, and each year toured local hospitals as a clown.  His final film performance was in Al Christie's circus film Pink Lemonade in 1936.\nAfter he became ill, the New York Daily Mirror falsely reported his death in November 1938.  His lawyers began action against the newspaper, but Toto died a few weeks later in the Bronx Hospital in New York, at the age of 50.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nToto at IMDb",

        "content": "Walid Daqqa (Arabic: وليد دقة; 18 July 1961 – 7 April 2024) was a Palestinian figure who was imprisoned for 38 years after he was convicted of commanding a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)-affiliated group that kidnapped and murdered an Israeli soldier. He was not convicted of the murder, but of commanding the group, a charge he rejected. Daqqa was the longest-serving Palestinian prisoner in Israeli jails.\nDaqqa, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was born in Baqa al-Gharbiyye in 1961. In 1984, a  group of Arab Israelis kidnapped and killed an Israeli soldier.  Daqqa was arrested two years later,  charged with commanding the responsible group. His conviction by an Israeli military court was based on old British emergency regulations. He received a life sentence without parole, but his sentence was later reduced to 37 years.\nDuring his imprisonment, he got married in 1999, and had a child in 2020 when his sperm was smuggled. Daqqa also completed both a bachelor's and master's degree in political science, and had been working on his doctorate. He authored several prison literature works, including a children's novel in 2018 that narrates the story of a boy, who uses magical olive oil from the Israeli-occupied West Bank to visit his imprisoned father.\nIn 2021, Daqqa was diagnosed with cancer, prompting calls for his release upon completion of his original sentence in 2023, but he had received a further two-year sentence in 2018 for smuggling mobile phones to prisoners. Amnesty International reported that Daqqa's lawyer who had visited him a few weeks before his death said that Daqqa had lost much weight and was subjected to torture. After Daqqa's death on 9 April 2024, Israeli police forcefully dispersed visitors who attended his funeral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDaqqa was born in the predominantly Arab city of Baqa al-Gharbiyye, Israel, in 1961, and was a Palestinian citizen of Israel. In adulthood he earned his living as a housepainter, working in Tel Aviv and Eilat. He was radicalized by the shock of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and   the Sabra and Chatila massacre, and subsequently joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nOn 6 August 1984, a  group of Arab Israelis kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Moshe Tamam, as he got off a bus near his home in the vicinity of Netanya. Tamam was found dead four days later, with \"massive\" head wounds. Daqqa was arrested on 25 March 1986 and accused of either being a member or commander, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)-affiliated group that abducted and killed Tamam. Daqqa was not present at the time of the kidnapping and, in  March 1987 was convicted of commanding the group, an accusation he always denied. According to Amnesty International, his conviction was based on emergency regulations enacted by British authorities in Mandatory Palestine, which allow for a lower threshold for proof than the criteria used in Israeli criminal law. He received a life sentence without parole, but his sentence was later reduced to 37 years. Daqqa was among 23 Palestinians held by Israel since before the Oslo Accords were signed in the 1990s.\nIn 1999, while in prison, he married Sanaa Salameh, a lawyer from Tira, after he obtained a rare permission for the wedding, and for photos of the ceremony to be taken. But he was not allowed to spend time with his wife in conjugal visits. Writing an open letter from prison in 2011, Daqqa expressed his desire for a child, who he would name Milad. The couple had a daughter in 2020, conceived after his sperm was smuggled out of prison. For this he was punished with a period of solitary confinement. Daqqa received bachelor's and master's degrees in political science in 2010 and 2016 respectively, and was reported in 2018 to have been working on his doctorate.\n\n\n== Works ==\nDaqqa wrote several books during his imprisonment, several of which have been described as being prison literature, and on politics and philosophy, and also a children's story. His works include The Tale of the Secrets of Oil, Fusion of Consciousness and A Parallel Time. The latter book, together with material from a long letter he had written to former MK Azmi Bishara, was adapted into a play and staged at the Al-Midan Theater in Haifa, and talks about the psychological state of prisoners. In the wake of the controversy over its staging, the theatre eventually lost half of its budget. Upon the launch of his children's novel titled The Tale of the Secrets of Oil in 2018, which talks about children of prisoners, it was reported that Daqqa was planning to write a sequel titled: \"The Tale of the Secret of the Sword,\" addressing refugees and their right of return.\n\n\n=== The Tale of the Secrets of Oil ===\nIn 2018, Daqqa authored his first novel for children, which was launched at the Mahmoud Darwish museum in Ramallah, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nThe Tale of the Secrets of Oil narrates the story of a 12-year-old boy named Jude, who was conceived with his imprisoned father's sperm. It begins as the boy prepares to meet his father for the first time in prison, but Jude receives news that, \"due to security reasons,\" his visit had been cancelled. Jude, who is heartbroken, goes for a walk in the countryside, engaging in a conversation with different species, including a rabbit, a cat, and eventually an olive tree named Um Rumi, who is 1,500-year-old. They all listen to the boy's frustration over his canceled prison visit, and tell him of their suffering under the occupation and their struggle for freedom.\nUm Rumi, the olive tree, tells the boy of her experience when Israel had threatened to uproot her so that she could be moved from the West Bank to the Israeli city of Afula. Afterwards, she tells the boy about her sacred oil, which she had been keeping as a secret. Jude rubbed the oil on his skin, making him invisible, and helping him visit his father in prison. Upon hearing a child's voice say, \"I am your son, Jude,\" his father thinks that he is losing his mind.\nThe oil mentioned in the novel is made in reference to Jesus, whose oil was claimed able to heal people's wounds. At the end of the book, Daqqa symbolizes the prison with a larger one where Palestinians live in the occupied territories. Daqqa mentions in the prelude of the novel that he is writing: \"until I am freed from prison, with the hope of freeing the prison from me.\" The explained goal of his novel is followed by the dedication: \"To Jude, that he may live his childhood, to all the children who have become adults before their time and to all the adults who have been deprived of a taste of childhood by prison.\"\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn 2021, Daqqa was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer, myelofibrosis, that disrupts blood cell production. As his sentence was due to expire in 2023, human rights activists called for an early release. He was due to be released in March 2023 on completion of his sentence, but he had already received a further two years sentence in 2018 for smuggling mobile phones to distribute to other prisoners to contact their families. Amnesty International reported that Daqqa's lawyer who had visited him on 24 March 2024 was \"shocked by his sharp weight loss and visible fragility,\" and accordingly, said that denying prisoners from access to medical care may constitute torture. It also reported that his lawyer stated that Daqqa was subjected to torture by the Israel Prison Service, including beatings and humiliation.\nDaqqa died from complications of cancer on 7 April 2024, at the age 62, after 38 years in prison. His family was not informed of his decease by the Israeli authorities, and only learnt of his passing through social media. The day after, the penultimate of Ramadan,  with authorities ignoring requests for the release of his body,   chairs had been arranged in the garden for visitors bringing condolences. Border police raided the garden and ordered the seats to be taken away. According to Gideon Levy, sitting and mourning were forbidden. By the late afternoon,  while the customary mourning tent was being erected, a further police raid took place: the mourners were beaten, shoved aside, with five arrested and the mourning tent was then torn down.\nAt the time of his death, Daqqa was one of the most prominent and longtime Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. The Palestinian Commission of Detainee Affairs stated that Daqqa's death brought the number of Palestinians that have died in Israeli prisons since 1967, when Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, to 251. And his death was the 14th in Israeli custody since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October 2023, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nIsraeli police are reported to have intervened forcefully to disperse visitors who had approached his home in Baqa al-Gharbiyye to pay their respects to his family after his death was announced, arresting five mourners. Daqqa's brother  stated that Itamar Ben-Gvir, the Israeli Minister of National Security had delayed the restitution of his body to his family for burial. Ben-Gvir  remarked that he was unhappy with his natural deaths because it was not the “death penalty for terrorists” he considered appropriate.\nSenior researcher Erika Guevara Rosas at Amnesty International wrote upon Daqqa's death that:\n\nEven on his deathbed, Israeli authorities continued to display chilling levels of cruelty against Walid Daqqah and his family, not only denying him adequate medical treatment and suitable food, but also preventing him from saying a final goodbye to his wife Sanaa Salameh and their four-year-old daughter Milad.\nIn response to an Amnesty International report on Daqqa, the Israeli Foreign Ministry wrote in a social media post: \"Amnesty, you have a disturbing obsession with glorifying sadistic murderers.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalestinian prisoners in Israel\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andile Mbenyane (born 15 March 1988) is a South African soccer player who plays as a forward for Chippa United in the South African Premier Division.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in Paarl, he joined the academy of Ajax Cape Town and got his senior debut for that club in the 2007–08 Premier Soccer League. He did not break through in the first team, and was first sent on loan to Ikapa Sporting, then permanently to Chippa United. With Chippa United, he won promotion and helped establish the club in the Premier Division, and eventually became team captain. In 2019 he played his 100th Premier Division game for Chippa United.\nAccording to Mbenyane, the Chippa United squad was given \"a scare\" in the winter of 2019 when the club released 13 players, resulting in the remaining players no longer \"dragging their feet at training\". In March 2020, it was reported that Mbenyane himself would be released by Chippa United after 11 years in the club. As the manager Rulani Mokwena allegedly had \"identified deadwood\" in the squad, there were talks about disciplinary problems and missing practices. Club owner Siviwe \"Chippa\" Mpengesi accused Mbenyane of growing too content in the club, and asked the player to \"come to the party and pick up his socks\". The player was not released, however, and started yet another season with Chippa United in 2020–21.\nMbenyane was injured during the spring of 2021, and could not take part in the 2020-21 Nedbank Cup final. Mbenyane was subsequently released during the summer of 2021. According to Chippa Mpengesi, this was \"painful\", but happened at the behest of new manager Gavin Hunt. In the fall of 2021 Mbenyane reportedly trained with Second Division club BCM Stars. He was back in Chippa United's matchday squad in February 2022. His first goal during this spell in the club came in the 2023-24 Nedbank Cup against Ravens.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMbenyane was married to Ahluma Nombulelo, who died in a car accident in 2015. He later married Pakama Aba.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ariz–Basurto line (Basque: Ariz-Basurto trenbidea, Spanish: Ferrocarril Ariz-Basurto) is a short single-track unelectrified railway line in Biscay, Basque Country, Spain. Owned by Euskal Trenbide Sarea, it connects the Basque narrow-gauge railway network with the Santander–Bilbao line. It is used for freight transport.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 2 August 1897 the government awarded the concession for a narrow-gauge railway between La Industrial (in Basurto) and Azbarren. The line opened in its entirety on 7 January 1906, connecting the Bilbao–San Sebastián and Santander–Bilbao line lines. Negotiations between the Santander–Bilbao Railway Company and Ferrocarriles Vascongados (the operator of the Bilbao–San Sebastián line) to establish a joint passenger service started in 1904. The negotiations proved difficult, and it wasn't until the opening of the San Sebastián–Hendaye line in 1912 that a joint service was inaugurated, running from Hendaye to Oviedo via San Sebastián, Bilbao and Santander. This service was short-lived, as the outbreak of World War I caused its suspension in 1914. Regular passenger service between San Sebastián and Santander wasn't restored after the end of the war.\nAriz, a station close to the terminus of the line at Azbarren, was also the starting point of a branchline that connected the Ferrocarriles Vascongados network with the broad-gauge Tudela–Bilbao railway at Dos Caminos. In 1918 a new line opened from Azbarren to Matiko, linking the Bilbao–San Sebastián line with the Bilbao–Plentzia railway. In the 1920s Ariz had eight tracks while nearby Azbarren had four. By the late 1950s freight traffic levels were falling. The Matiko–Azbarren line  had to be closed in 1969 due to the collapse of a tunnel, while the branchline to Dos Caminos closed in 1970 due to low traffic. The line from Basurto to Ariz remained open, and in the 1970s a new freight yard was built by FEVE in Ariz.\nIn 2016, after four years of works, the line was put underground in Bilbao. The urban section through Iralabarri was replaced by a cut-and-cover tunnel, while the old tunnel under Miribilla was replaced by a new one. The Constitutional Court ruled in 2016 that the Ariz–Basurto and Irauregi–Lutxana lines had to be transferred from the Adif-operated Red Ferroviaria de Interés General to Euskal Trenbide Sarea, since they run entirely within the Basque Country. The transfer of the two lines took place in December 2018. In 2023, the Basque Government made public a proposal to cover the line in Basauri.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to Ariz–Basurto line at OpenStreetMap",

        "content": "Nicolas “Nico” Kenn De Balinthazy (born 8 September 1998) better known online as Sneako, is an American online streamer.\nSneako is generally considered to be part of the \"manosphere\", an ideology promoting masculinity, misogyny, and opposition to feminism. His commentaries have been deemed controversial and considered to be encouraging misogynistic views amongst young males. Sneako had amassed over 1.28 million subscribers on his main channel on YouTube, before being banned in October 2022.\nSneako has since joined Rumble and as of October 2023, he was the seventh most-watched channel with 1.37 million hours watched, maintaining popularity among young male viewers.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\nSneako was born in New York City and grew up in an affluent and predominately white neighborhood, graduating from the Foote School in New Haven, Connecticut in 2014. His father is from Haiti and is mixed-race, while his mother’s family is from the Philippines. Sneako has visited Haiti just about every year since he was two years old, as most of his family still lives there.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSince his debut online, Sneako has posted various content from gaming uploads, IRL streams, and reaction videos. In one particular video, Sneako would ask Black people if it were okay for people who weren’t black to say the N-word and would offer White people one dollar to say it.\nSneako is a supporter of Andrew Tate and has been seen in videos with him as a regular. Sneako has expressed admiration for Tate, crediting him and his brother Tristan for their assistance in his betterment.\nSneako’s content has also been described as supporting far-right political views. In 2022, Sneako joined Kanye West’s 2024 presidential campaign and has referred to him as his childhood hero. He has also voiced support far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Speaking at an American First rally in July 2023, Sneako said, “Nick Fuentes is going to the next president of the United States.\"\nIn 2023, Sneako defended homophobic and transphobic shouting by fans, including that \"all gays should die\", stating \"this is how I was at 12. But if it sounds egregious to you, blame the [rainbow emoji] (sic) flags in their classrooms. Blame the media for emasculating men. It's your fault for forcing an obvious agenda.\"\nIn March 2024, PinkNews reported that Sneako had claimed that MrBeast (who he formerly collaborated with) was \"pushing kids to transgenderism\", along with the \"baseless claim\" that male-bodied individuals were removing their genitalia as a result of MrBeast continuing to support a trans collaborator.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As a featured artist ====\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n=== As featured artist ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSneako on Rumble\nSneako on Twitter\nSneako at IMDb",

        "content": "Eulytine (German: Eulytin from Ancient Greek: εΰλυτος, fusible, easily dissolved) or bismuth blende (obsolete) — one of the rarest minerals in nature, the composition is bismuth silicate with the calculation formula Bi4(SiO4)3 or Bi4Si3O12. The mineral forms isometric cubic crystals up to 2 mm in size, the supporting form of which is a tetrahedron or tristetrahedron. Among the varieties, there are also often concentric, fibrous or spherical aggregates of a very impressive appearance, which were previously called agricolites.\nEulitine is a secondary mineral, a product of the oxidation of bismuth and its compounds.: 303 \n\n\n== Discovery history and name ==\nThe history of the discovery of the mineral is complex and confusing. At the beginning of the 19th century, eulitine was described by August Breithaupt over several years, moreover, three times and under different names. He was the first to describe eulitine agricolites under their modern name as spherical crystals with a glossy surface. A second description was given under the name bismuth blende, in which Breithaupt stated that he had known about this mineral for many years, but believed it to be sphalerite. In 1817, Breithaupt made a third description using Abraham Gottlob Werner's new mineralogical system, called or «arsenic-bismuth» (German: Arsenik-Wismuth).\nIn particular, Breithaupt wrote: “Thanks to arsenic-bismuth, an interesting new <mineral> species has arisen in the bismuth family, previously unknown, which appears to be a rare mineral. It has the following characteristics: dark hairy brown color, variously shaped <crystals> and formed small balls and hemispheres. The outside is matte, sometimes with a white coating; the inside is not very shiny — to very iridescent, sometimes with a greasy sheen. The fracture is vaguely conchoidal, diverges into tufts and asterisks of “small cracks,” but also encounters dense, uneven areas. A <complete> fracture into fragments and wedge-shaped fragments is possible; demonstrates clear attachment to very thin and concentric, individual edges with a curved shell <...>; soft, fairly fragile, likely to break easily, and heavy. <...> Arsenic-bismuth <(German: Arsenik-Wismuth)> is very similar in appearance to radiated blende <wurtzite>, but is always very different from it in color, softness, etc.”\nThe above passage represents the first documented description of eulytine, and the name of this mineral was in one chapter of this publication, as if having nothing to do with arsenic-bismuth, and the above text (with a description of the previously unknown “Arsenik-Bismuth”) was in another. Finally, after a short pause of sound reflection, Breithaupt accepted the identity of all three of their described minerals: eulytine, bismuth blende and arsenic-bismuth.\nThe type specimen of eulytine is kept at the Mining Academy, Freiberg, Germany.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nMost often, eulytine varieties are small in size, however, they stand out for their catchy and spectacular appearance. Transparent or translucent crystals are red-brown or green in color and do not exceed a few millimeters at the extreme points. Crystals are often individual tetrahedrons, often complexly modified, but there are also spherical varieties that have an almost perfectly spherical shape. Druses of crystals can consist of several individuals; completely fused crystals are sometimes separated only by the protruding vertices of tetrahedrons; in rare cases, almost smooth spherical clusters grow into each other (the so-called agricolites). More often, eulytine occurs in the form of individual spherical aggregates.\nSome varieties range from transparent to translucent to completely opaque. Color also varies in a wide range of shades: from dark brown and green to yellowish-gray, grayish-white, straw-yellow and colorless; in thin chips from colorless to pale brown.\nThe luster varies widely: from diamond to glassy, some slightly transparent or opaque varieties have a greasy or waxy luster. There is no pleochroism. The actual measured density is from 6.1 to 6.6 g/cm3, the calculated one is 6.76 g/cm3. Eulytine typically forms modified tetrahedral crystals with tristetrahedral shapes (often with a dominant positive tristetrahedron and a subordinate negative tristetrahedron), often with small cube faces between the tetrahedral shapes. Twinning at {001} is common.\n\n\n== Mineral formation ==\n\nEulytine is one of the rarest minerals in nature, which made it very difficult to study in the 19th century. Vladimir Vernadsky considered evilitine to be one of the problem areas of contemporary mineralogy and classified it as “earthy, little studied bodies”, the further modifications and further metamorphism of which are unknown. As he believed, the transition of bismuth to eulytite requires further study and confirmation, and an indication of it could go to all mineralogical catalogs solely thanks to Breithaupt's description.: 303 \nEulytine was discovered together with quartz and native bismuth in Schneeberg and Johanngeorgenstadt (Germany). In the Caucasus, the mineral is found in albitized pegmatites in the form of tetrahedral crystals and crusts around tantalum grains.\n\n\n== Occurrence ==\nThe type deposit of eulytine is located in Saxony (Schneeberg, Johanngeorgenstadt); in Germany this mineral was later discovered in Höchstberg, near Hausach, and in the Clara mines near Oberwolfach, Black Forest. In Romania, found in Dogneci (formerly Dognačka). In England — a deposit near Lanlivery, Cornwall; and also in Southwick, near Dalbeattie, Kirkcubrightshire (Scotland). In Canada, eulytine is known from the Evans-Loup mines, near Wakeld, Quebec.\nIn Russia, samples of eulitine were found at the Kvartalnoye deposit (Sverdlovsk Region, Asbestovsky District) and at the Syuigachan ore occurrence (Khabarovsk Territory, Verkhnebureinsky District).\n\n\n== Usage ==\nEulytine crystals are used in high-precision technology for the production of optical quality ceramics. It is obtained by pressing small natural or synthetic crystals. The unique properties of eulitine make it possible to use it as a scintillator in high-energy physics, computed tomography and dosimetry. However, the rarity of the mineral and the defectiveness of natural crystals turned the raw material into an extremely rare, scarce material. This became the reason for carrying out numerous works on growing artificial crystals. Ceramics obtained from laboratory-grown raw materials have better scintillation characteristics.\nA similar and one of the most promising materials for the above purposes is also single-crystalline bismuth orthogermanate with a eulitine-type structure. However, eulithin has better scintillation characteristics compared to bismuth orthogermanate. For example, in terms of exposure time (0.1 ms), eilitine exceeds it three times. Due to the complexity of growing eulitine single crystals from a high-viscosity melt, their production represents an important and promising technological problem, which several research teams worked on in the 2010s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBismutite\nBismuthinite\nBismoclite\nBismite\nZavaritskite\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEulytine (A valid IMA mineral species, grandfathered): information about the mineral eulytine in the Mindat database.\nEulytine: John W.

        "content": "Florence Ivy Mary Holmes (1891–1983) was a dancer and the English wife of Archibald Belaney (1888 – 1938), commonly known as \"Grey Owl\".: 63 \n\n\n== Early life ==\nIvy was born in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois on 11 April 1891, the daughter of John Robert Holmes, a doctor, and Florence Amelia Jane Abraham (1864-1941).\nHer father died when she was only two, and her mother returned to west London, initially in Bedford Park, later moving to Hammersmith. Around 1900, Florence became friends with Belaney's aunts in Hastings, due to a shared interest in purebred Collie dogs. Florence and Ivy began visiting the Belaneys during school holidays at their home, Highbury Villa on St. James' Road. \"Archie liked Ivy and tried to impress her. Thinking she would be interested, he showed her how he fed frogs to his snakes.\": 22  She recalled playing at being Indians with Archie: \"I was his squaw 'Dancing Moonbeam' and he was 'Big Chief Thunderbinder'\".\nBelaney would stay with the Holmeses at their home in Hammersmith while exploring the city. On his way to Liverpool, en route to Canada, he and his aunt Ada stayed with the Holmes family, where, on 29 March 1906, he boarded the SS Canada for Halifax, Nova Scotia. That was the last Ivy  saw of him till after the war.: 22, 24 \n\n\n== Career as dancer ==\nTrained as a ballet dancer in London, Ivy joined an English troupe at the age of 15. The company danced and imitated famous British actors. Escorted by her mother, Ivy performed in many European countries from 1906 to 1912, including Belgium, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Turkey. After a run of three months in Constantinople, the tour was cut short by the outbreak of the Balkan War in 1912, and Ivy and her mother returned to England.: 61 \n\n\n== Marriage to Belaney ==\nDuring World War I, Belaney served in the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force on the front line in France. He was shipped back to England after being severely wounded in the right foot, where it was found necessary to amputate a toe. From November 1916 to March 1917, he convalesced in the Canadian Military Hospital in his home town of Hastings.: 58–60 \nAt his aunts' suggestion, he contacted Ivy, whom he had not seen since 1906, when he had left for Canada.\n\nArchie, a future master of the stage himself, must have listened avidly to Ivy’s stories of travelling across Europe. In Russia she once saw a line of men chained to each other on their way to Siberia. Of all the European\ncities she visited, Ivy loved Vienna, and most of all Budapest. Her stories about her impersonations on stage must have fascinated this veteran of nearly a decade of presenting himself as part-Indian in Canada.\n: 61 \n\nFor her part,\n\nIvy enjoyed Archie’s company. Always he was so polite, and had excellent manners. He wore his hair short. In her presence he never drank or swore. In many ways the man had become but a larger projection of the boy, with\nthe same intense love of nature and North American Indians.: 61 \n\nThey were married on 10 February 1917 at St Leonard's Church, Hollington, Hastings, by the Rev John Backhouse Holmes M.A. Her mother was a witness. Belaney stated that he was a bachelor, although he was still married to his first wife, Angele Egwuna, whom he had married in 1910 in Canada.: 63 \nEncouraged by Ivy to start writing, Belaney completed a short manuscript about his first canoeing lessons in Temagami. Ivy later reported that he made the \"backwoods sound terribly attractive”.: 61–62 \nThey decided that Archie should return to Canada, then, once he had established himself, she would follow.\n\"Adventuresome as always, and deeply in love with her husband, Ivy accepted the plan of beginning a life together in the northern Canadian forest. Archie sailed on September 19, 1917. Ivy never saw him again.\": 63 \nBelaney eventually wrote to confess that he was already married. Ivy filed for divorce in 1921.: 67 \n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1921 she was living with the family of her future husband in Paddington. She divorced Belaney in 1922 and after her divorce came through in September  married John Kingston Edward Cash (1890–1963) later that year. They had a daughter, Vivien, born 1924. They lived in Twickenham; during the 1930s at Cresswell Road, and at Ellesmere Road in the 1940s. On 29 March 1983 she died in a nursing home in Hindhead, Surrey.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Its head, thorax, and abdomen range from brown to black, hindwings from yellow to white, the apex of cephalic process from yellow to red, and the tegmen all the way from white with unmargined black spots, to black or very dark with yellow, margined spots, and green veins. However, it can be identified by having the apex of cephalic process distinctly brightened, but yet having no similar pattern at 2/3 of the wings as in Pyrops pythicus.\nIt was previously placed in the pyrorhynchus group, it was moved to the candelaria group because of its hindwings.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "This is an incomplete list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland for the years from 1751 to 1800.\nSee also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700 and List of acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701–1750.\nThe number shown by each act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the years of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the act concerning assay passed in 1783 is cited as \"23 & 24 Geo. 3. c. 23\", meaning the 23rd act passed during the session that started in the 23rd year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 24th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"40 Geo. 3\" rather than \"40 Geo. III\").  Acts of the reign of Elizabeth I are formally cited without a regnal numeral in the Republic of Ireland.\nActs passed by the Parliament of Ireland did not have a short title; however, some of these acts have subsequently been given a short title by acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, or acts of the Oireachtas.  This means that some acts have different short titles in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland respectively. Official short titles are indicated by the flags of the respective jurisdictions.\nA number of the acts included in this list are still in force in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland.  Because these two jurisdictions are entirely separate, the version of an Act in force in one may differ from the version in force in the other; similarly, an Act may have been repealed in one but not in the other.\nA number of acts passed by the Parliament of England or the Parliament of Great Britain also extended to Ireland during this period.\n\n\n== 1751–1760 ==\n\n\n=== 25 Geo. 2 (1751)

        "content": "The National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) was a short-lived South African peacekeeping force created in the run-up to the first democratic elections in 1994. Its purpose was to address the various security concerns and maintain peace during this transitional period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nIn 1992, the Goldstone Commission observed that there was mistrust amongst populace of the existing Apartheid-era security forces. On 2 June 1993, the Technical Committee on Violence of the Multiparty Negotiating Process recommended \"the establishment of an independent peacekeeping force with a multi-party composition to function as the primary peacekeeping force for the elections\". In August 1993, a provision for a national peacekeeping force had been incorporated into a draft Transitional Executive Council bill. The bill was enacted by the Tricameral Parliament in September 1993 but was not in effect until November 1993.: 13–15  In February 1994, the TEC requested from the Commonwealth assistance in training the NPKF; the Commonwealth Peacekeeping Assistance Group consisted of 33 members from 7 countries tasked with advising and training the NPKF.: 14 \n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe National Peacekeeping Force was formed by merging personnel from the SADF, uMkhonto we Sizwe, the various bantustan security forces and the SAP. The SAP was initially excluded from the planning process due to its Internal Stability Unit's conduct within townships. Allegations against the Internal Stability Unit is one of the reasons that prompted the formation of a peacekeeping force.\nParticipants in the NPKF included:\n\nSouth African Defence Force\nSouth African Police\nuMkhonto we Sizwe\nTranskei Defence Force and its police force\nVenda Defence Force and its police force\nCiskei Defence Force and its police force\nKwandebele Police Force\nGazankulu Police Force\nLebowa Police Force\nKaNgwane Police Force\nQwaQwa Police Force\nInitially, a figure between 2000 and 30 000 personnel had been proposed. But due to the short time constraint and limited accommodation 3 743 personnel in 3 battalions were inducted on 24 January 1994. On 19 February 1993, a further 1 200 recruits were the last personnel to be inducted; for a total of 4 943.: 10  On 25 March 1994, a plan to add an additional 5000 was scrapped.\nSAP members amounted to 197.: 10 \n\n\n=== Head of the Force ===\nIn March 1993, Nelson Mandela proposed a peacekeeping force be placed under UN supervision with possibly a foreign commander. Two candidates, Brigadier George Kruys from the SADF and Brigadier Derek Mgwebi from the Transkei Defence Force were shortlisted. As neither candidate had adequate support and a foreign commander was ruled out, the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) named Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana as commander on 8 February 1994.: 18  This was met with objections as Ramushwana had in April 1990 overthrown the democratically elected government of President Frank Ravele and established a military government.: 12–13 \n\n\n=== Mandate ===\nThe NPKF was charged with keeping the peace in volatile areas. Lawyers for Human Rights suggested the NPKF be deployed during the 1994 Bophuthatswana crisis. But on 12 March 1994, Lucas Mangope was deposed and the TEC deployed the NPKF to the East Rand.: 29 \n\n\n=== Disbandment ===\nOn 2 June 1994, the NPKF was officially disbanded.: 29 \n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn 18 April 1994, nine days before the elections, the NPKF shot and killed two children and Ken Oosterbroek, a photojournalist covering a clash between peacekeepers, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party in Thokoza.: 24 \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMilitary history of South Africa\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in South Africa\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tuvalu.TV is a Tuvaluan television channel that started in 2019. The station was set up by MMG Communications from New Zealand and started broadcasting at the end of 2019. The state broadcaster Tuvalu Broadcasting Corporation is responsible for the network, which up until its launch was only responsible for the local radio stations.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocal television is not new to Tuvalu. An early experiment appeared after the failure of a foreign free-to-air operator, whose content appeared between the mid-1990s and 1998 when it shut down due to failure in the equipment and unsuccessful attempts at repairing. Shortly after this event, television was limited to Funafuti where the local service broadcast pre-recorded events such as fatele dances one hour a week.\nIn early November 2019, Tuvalu.TV received the equipment to carry an 11 channel digital subscription television service, with the service scheduled to launch in December.\nThe first experimental broadcast of Tuvalu.TV was held on 27 November 2019 with the first live broadcast of a session of the Parliament of Tuvalu in a broadcast assisted by Papua New Guinea-based Richard Broadbridge, who is the head of Click Pacific. To prepare for this broadcast, which was a live stream on Facebook, staff from the Tuvalu Broadcasting Corporation was given a two-month period of training. The first news bulletin aired on December 6, 2019, one week after the first test. The station later opened formally on 16 December 2019 with an opening ceremony at 8:30am that day, followed by a parliamentary session at 10am.\nTuvalu.TV is the only free channel in the platform, while the other channels require a subscription. The launch of the channel came after a long history of attempts at starting a functional local service.\nTuvalu.TV joined the Pasifika TV network on 14 September 2023, enabling the channel to have access to the programme feed, as well as receiving technical support from New Zealand.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tele Haiti (French: Télé Haïti, stylized TeleHaiti) is a Haitian telecommunications company that operates a cable television network. It was founded in 1959 as Haiti's first television station, and it operated as a terrestrial service during its first decade.  It is owned by Access Haiti S.A.\n\n\n== History ==\nTélé Haïti's first broadcast took place on December 13, 1959. The station was founded under the initiative of American Gérald Bartelt, and its transmitter was located in the sector of Boutiliers, broadcasting on VHF channel 5. The channel's financial difficulties in its early years resulted in a cut of its broadcasting hours (from over six hours every day of the week, to just one day per week from March 15, 1965).A new contract signed between Tele Haiti and the Haitian State in December 1969 enabled the establishment of a cable television network, while also authorizing the channel to begin its color broadcasts. The system debuted in 1971, where Tele Haiti inaugurated a new two-channel system, on channels 2 and 4, subsequently abandoning the terrestrial station on channel 5.In December 1974 the Haitian government announced Tele Haiti's end of the television monopoly — which generated uncertainties among the American investors (which controlled 87% of the company's stocks) over possible economical compensations on that regard— which was achieved with the launch of National Television of Haiti in 1979.\nIn 1982, under the helm of Philippe Bayard, and with the company nearing bankruptcy, the process to start relays of foreign channels started. In July 1985, the company's headquarters located at the Jean Jacques Dessalines Boulevard was destroyed by a fire, for which in 1987 a new building at the Harry Truman Boulevard in Port-au-Prince was built.After being heavily damaged by the 2010 earthquake and suspending its operations, Télé Haiti announced the rebuilding of its network after the company's acquisition by Access Haiti S.A., restarting its activities in April 2012, this time by means of a wireless digital television system (unlike the cable system used before).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Sindh Sultanate (Sindhi: سنڌ جي سلطنت, Persian: سلطان نشین سند) or historically romanized as Sultanate of Sind, was a medieval Indo-Islamic sultanate established in the mid 14th century primarily based in Sindh and some parts of Gujarat and Punjab. Following the defeat of Soomra Emirate by the Sammas, three dynasties ruled over the Sindh Sultanate sequentially: the Samma dynasty (1351–1524), the Arghun dynasty (1520–1554), and the Tarkhan dynasty (1554–1593).\nThe Sindh Sultanate controlled large parts of Derajat, Kutch, and Lasbela along with the entirety of Sindh itself. It reached its zenith under Jam Nizam'ud-Din II, who worked beside Sultan Mahmud Begada to establish peace and prosperity in the region. The Sultanate was run by Sindhi, Jat, Rajput, Turco-Mongol, Turco-Persian, and Gujarati elites and nobles. Sindh before the Sammas was administered by the Soomras as a vassal state of the Fatimids and then of the Abbasids and Delhiites. During the reign of the Sammas, Thatta thrived into India's one of the most economically and systematically powerful cities of that time. Sindh was a major hub for the influential teachings of the Isma'ili missionaries (Da'is) and Sunni saints (Shaykhs). The Sultans themselves adopted many rituals of the religious leaders and allowed them to openly preach their message to the masses. The early Samma Jams ruled from Samui but moved to Thatta after its dignification. The Arghuns, on the other hand, ruled the Lower Sindh from Thatta while the Upper Sindh from Bhakkar. Thatta, together with Bhakkar and Sehwan, were the only mint cities and major commercial and residential districts of the Sultanate. Persian was exercised upon as the court and state language as well as the lingo of the elites while Sindhi and Kutchi were used by the commoners. For the majority of its timespan, the Sultanate had great political and traditional ties with other countries like Gujarat, Kashmir, Bengal, Punjab, Delhi, and the Deccan sultanates. These interrelations resulted in the establishment of interconnected trade and businesses.\n\n\n== List of dynasties ==\n\n\n=== Samma dynasty (1351 – 1524) ===\n\n\n=== Arghun dynasty (1520 – 1555) ===\n\n\n=== Tarkhan dynasty (1555 – 1593) ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===",

        "content": "Accessible QR is a type of QR code that combines a standard QR code with a dot-dash pattern positioned around one corner of the code to provide product information for people who are blind and partially sighted.  \nThe codes, announce product categories and product details such as instructions, ingredients, safety warnings, and recycling information. The data is structured for the needs of users who are blind or partially sighted and offers larger text or audio output. It can read QR codes from a metre away, activating the smartphone's accessibility features like VoiceOver to announce product details. The codes make product information accessible to people with varying levels of visual acuity. Sighted users can scan the codes using a smartphone camera or QR code readers. In contrast, blind and partially sighted users can use apps to receive tailored product information.\n\n\n== Technology ==\nAn accessible QR code represents an enhanced form of the traditional QR code, distinguished by an integrated pattern known as a \"D3 code\" (denoted by its distinctive dot-dot-dash pattern). This pattern is placed around one corner on one side of the code. The primary enhancement of these accessible QR codes is their design consideration for individuals with visual impairments, including those who are blind or have low vision.When scanned, these QR codes interact with the device's configured accessibility settings, enabling the presentation of information in more accessible formats. This includes options such as larger text displays for those with visual impairment or audio descriptions and voice-guided assistance for the blind. Such adaptations make the information contained in QR codes more universally accessible and user-friendly.The codes can be read by accessibility apps like Be Me Eyes and Microsoft SeeingAI and are currently being used on Unilever brand packaging for some Persil products and other healthcare products in the UK. \n\n\n== References ==\nBlindness equipment",

        "content": "Mount Berenice is a mountain in the Galilee, located near the Sea of Galilee south of Tiberias. The height of the mountain is about 190 meters above sea level. Remains of a Byzantine church and a mosque from the 8th century AD were found on the mountain.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\n\nHerod Antipas had a magnificent palace in Tiberias, which may have been the palace of the princess Berenice, about whom Josephus told in his writings, hence the name of the mountain \"Mount Berenice\". During the Byzantine period, in the sixth century, a church was built on the eastern peak of the mountain, possibly on the ruins of the palace of Antipas. The church was a magnificent building with an area of about 1,400 square meters. At the heart of the church stood a monolithic stone that was used as a sacred relic, and apparently was connected to the story of Jesus' activity in the Sea of Galilee.\nEmperor Justinian I built a wall, which reached from Tiberias to the western peak of the mountain, and ended with two towers that are 15 meters high and each of their sides is 7.5 meters long. In the 749 Galilee earthquake, the buildings on the mountain were destroyed, including the church, but it was renovated again in the early Muslim period, during the eighth century and was used as a church until after the Battle of Hattin, in which the Crusaders lost leading to the end of their kingdom in the Land of Israel about 100 years later.\nAfter the destruction of the church, the place remained desolate for many years. In 1990, archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld began excavating the site. No remains have been found of Berenice's palace, but a Byzantine church, and remains of a wall and tower have been uncovered. The Jewish National Fund openend a road leading from the upper neighborhoods of Tiberias to the site. A Roman theater was discovered on the side of the mountain by archaeologists Yizhar Hirschfeld and Yosef Stefansky, with about 5,000-6,000 seats. The municipality of Tiberias plans to turn the amphitheater into a performance center and integrate it into The Berko Archaeological Park, an archaeological park in the south of Tiberias, which includes archaeological finds from the Roman period.\nAnother building was uncovered near the church, and the hypothesis was that it was used as a market during the Byzantine period of the city. In 2009, archaeologist Katia Tzitrin-Silverman from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem discovered that the building was used as a mosque, and it is possible that the church and the mosque operated side by side at the same time, each serving its own community. Similar mosques from the same period were discovered in Damascus and the city of Jerash in Jordan.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Debregeasia australis, commonly known as china grass or  native ramie, is a plant in the nettle family Urticaceae endemic to Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDebregeasia australis is a shrub or small tree growing to about 5 m (16 ft) tall, but will flower and fruit at about 2 m (6 ft 7 in). The leaves are broadly ovate, up to 17 cm (6.7 in) long and 14 cm (5.5 in) wide, green above and bright white underneath, and the margins (edges) are toothed. They have 3–4 pairs of lateral veins, the first pair of which depart from the midrib at the very base of the leaf blade and extend about 2/3 of the way to the apex. The petiole measures up to 9 cm (3.5 in) long, and the stipules up to 8 mm (0.31 in) long.\nThe inflorescences occur in the leaf axils and consist of clusters of very small flowers - male flowers are about 1 mm (0.04 in) long while female flowers are about 0.5 mm (0.02 in) long. The fruit is an achene about 0.7 mm (0.03 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described by the botanists Ib Friis, Christine Melanie Wilmot-Dear and Chia Jui Chen, and published in the Edinburgh Journal of Botany in 2012. Prior to this, the Queensland plants had been misidentified as Boehmeria nivea.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species is endemic to Queensland, from the Mackay area north to about Cape Tribulation. It occurs mostly on the sub-coastal tablelands at 400–1,000 m (1,300–3,300 ft), occasionally reaching the coastal lowlands, and it grows on rainforest margins and beside streams in very wet areas.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Government's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation as least concern. As of 8 April 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

        "content": "\"The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball\" is the 16th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that aired on the Nickelodeon network on 3 April 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nStimpy keeps throwing up hairballs, which disgusts Ren until he learns from a TV report that cat hairballs are now more valuable than gold. Ren converts their home into a factory where Stimpy keeps throwing up hairballs onto an assembly line while Ren's nephew Bubba boxes them. Stimpy cannot make any more hairballs. Ren forces Stimpy to lick him and Bubba in an attempt to make more hairballs to no avail. Bubba is sent inside of Stimpy where he discovers that Stimpy's glands have turned to dusk. Ren and Stimpy then look at the clock, and notice the time is up for the episode, causing them to dance with glee.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nBubba-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was started by Spümcø in 1992 and it fell behind schedule and over budget. The script for \"The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball\" was taken from a fan-made comic sent to Spümcø. As a cost-saving measure, the lay-out stage of the episode was done at the subcontractor, Rough Draft Korea in Seoul, instead at Spümcø in Los Angeles. When Spümcø lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, the Games Animation studio took over, which further delayed the production of \"The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski condemned \"The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball\" as an \"annoying juvenile\" story whose gross-out gags were immature and unfunny.. Komorowski wrote that \"The Cat That Laid the Golden Hairball\" bore all the signs of indifference from the Games Animation studio who were not clearly interested in the story. \n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Sir George Henry Jenkins CMG (21 September 1843 – 18 July 1911) was an Australian public servant. He served as a clerk in the Parliament of Victoria from 1882 to 1910. In 1901, following the federation of the Australian colonies, he also acted as the inaugural clerk of the Australian House of Representatives. In that capacity he managed the arrangements for the formal opening and first official sitting of the Parliament of Australia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJenkins was born on 21 September 1843 in Bedminster, Bristol, England. He was the seventh of eight children of Mary (née Osland) and Henry Jenkins. His father, a schoolteacher by profession, was born in Abergavenny, Wales.Jenkins and his family immigrated to Australia during the Victorian gold rush, arriving in Melbourne in January 1853 where his father worked as a draper. He attended Thomas Fenner's Collegiate School in South Yarra before completing his education at Melbourne Grammar School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Victorian Parliament ===\nJenkins joined the public service in 1861 as a clerk in the Railways Department. In 1865 he transferred to Parliament House, Melbourne, as private secretary and clerk of private bills under long-serving Legislative Assembly speaker Francis Murphy. He was promoted to clerk of committees in 1870 and to clerk-assistant in 1878.In 1882, Jenkins was appointed clerk of the legislative assembly. He moved to the Legislative Council in 1891 following the retirement of the incumbent, which was widely seen as a promotion and gave him the additional title of clerk of parliaments. Jenkins ultimately retired from parliament in 1910 after 45 years of service. In the lead-up to the federation of the Australian colonies, he additionally served as clerk of the Federal Council of Australasia and of the Australasian Federation Conference held in Melbourne in 1890.\n\n\n=== Federal Parliament ===\nFollowing Federation in 1901 and the inaugural federal election, Jenkins was appointed to act as the inaugural clerk of the House of Representatives with effect from 1 April 1901. He took up the role on a temporary basis while on a leave of absence from the Victorian parliament, and likely did not seek a permanent appointment as his salary in Victoria was substantially higher.Simultaneously with Jenkins' appointment to the House, South Australian clerk of parliaments Edwin Gordon Blackmore was appointed as the inaugural clerk of the Senate. Jenkins was privately critical of Blackmore, who had published several books on parliamentary procedures and openly lobbied for appointment to the new federal parliament. He reportedly described him as someone who \"wrote a few useless\ncompilations of Imperial Speaker’s decisions for the sake of notoriety\" and the South Australian parliament as having \"the same importance as a parish council, no more than the Board of Works\".Jenkins' primary task as acting clerk was to organise the arrangements for the official opening of parliament by Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York, which took place on 9 May 1901 at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. His role in organising the proceedings gave him a public profile, with Melbourne's Punch magazine describing him as \"probably the happiest, proudest, most important and most worried individual throughout the length and breadth of Australia\". He was caricatured alongside the Duke of Cornwall and Prime Minister Edmund Barton in The Bulletin, and appears in the foreground of Tom Roberts' oil painting The Big Picture depicting the opening.Jenkins also collaborated with Blackmore and Barton in drafting the initial standing orders for the House and Senate, although Blackmore was the primary author. After the official opening, the parliament transferred to Melbourne's Parliament House for its first session, with he and other parliamentary officials seated at the centre table in accordance with Westminster tradition. Jenkins resigned his role as acting clerk on 6 July 1901 to return to the Victorian parliament, and was succeeded by the Senate clerk-assistant Charles Cashel Gavan Duffy. He was the first person to receive a formal vote of thanks from the House of Representatives.According to an anecdote recounted by federal MP James Hume Cook, Jenkins once interrupted Barton during an early sitting of the House to inform him he had taken delivery of \"the finest trout he ever saw in his life\". Barton then absented himself from the chamber to oversee the preparation of the trout, which was immediately cooked and eaten for lunch by Jenkins, Barton, Cook and John Forrest in a small room behind the parliamentary library.\n\n\n=== Honours and assessment ===\nJenkins was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1891 for his services to the Australasian Federation Conference, and in 1904 he was appointed Knight Bachelor. In 1901, he was described by Punch as \"probably the best parliamentarian in the Commonwealth\". He received parliamentary tributes upon his knighthood, and his obituary in The Argus stated that \"few men have been known in official and private circles in Victoria for such a long period\".  However, some of Jenkins' contemporaries did not hold him in high esteem. He had a reputation for alcoholism and was known to interject in parliamentary debates. His subordinate Edward Theodor Hubert kept a detailed diary in which he accused Jenkins of procrastination, incompetence, and misusing parliamentary staff for his personal ends. Raymond Wright, the author of an official history of the Parliament of Victoria published in 1992, concluded that Jenkins was \"a lazy, dictatorial, unctuous opportunist\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1887, Jenkins married Caroline Kent, with whom he had three children. His son Arthur Jenkins served in the Western Australian Legislative Council.After his retirement in 1910, Jenkins moved to Ceylon to live with his daughter on a tea plantation near Hatton, hoping the climate would aid his recovery from bronchitis. He died in Colombo on 18 July 1911, aged 67.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Family is a 2020 video game by Sheinman Games, the studio of independent British developer Tim Sheinman. Described by the creator as a \"unique detective game of musical genealogy\", Family is a puzzle game in which players piece together information from radio interviews, music and written notes to identify a series of band members in a fictitious music scene, the 'London Pop Scene', displayed on an incomplete family tree from 1985 to 1995. The game contains short recordings from each fictional artist evocative of real-world counterparts in 80s and 90s indie and alternative music. Following release, Family received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the quality and verisimilitude of the game's music and the construction of its narrative through its puzzle gameplay mechanics. Sheinman published a follow-up title with a similar premise, Rivals, in late 2020.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nFamily is a puzzle video game in which players are tasked to correctly identify a series of 30 members of fictitious musical acts and their roles in the 'London Pop Scene', active from 1985 to 1995. Players are provided writings, music recordings and radio tracks to fill in a family tree, using the information and logic to correctly connect a list of names to roles in various bands. Certain members may appear multiple times or change their role across bands, requiring players to deduce the changes from the evidence provided. Sussex FM, a fictitious radio station, plays the songs from each band with interviews of guest Ella Neil in between, providing further clues on the membership. Players can alternate between playing nine individual tracks on demand or listening to the radio station in the background. Once players have guessed five names correctly, these names will be confirmed as correct and additional written clues will be provided.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSheinman developed Family between June to July 2020 as a \"taxonomic detective game\", based on Rock Family Trees, a series of books and television show depicting the connections between popular music artists in family trees and the games of independent developer Lucas Pope. The fictional bands and music in the game were based on several real-world artists from the game's reference period, including The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Smiths, Soft Cell, Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Mock Turtles, The Stone Roses, Talk Talk, Tears for Fears, Slowdive and Cocteau Twins. Sheinman revisited and refined the music-based concept and puzzle game mechanics of Family in several later titles, including the 2020 game Rivals and the 2022 game Riley and Rochelle.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTom Sykes of PC Gamer praised the game as a \"great\" title, commending the game's tracks as \"cracking tunes\" that were \"well-produced\" and \"convincing\", and assessing the game's theme to be \"clearly borne from a love and deep understanding of indie music and of a bygone age of music journalism\". Robert Purchese of Eurogamer described the game's \"impressive\" original music as the \"real star\", considering it to be \"recorded to such a high quality it could be the real thing\" and contributed to building a \"picture of an unmistakable time and place\". Alice Bell of Describing Family as a \"piece of detective micro-fiction\" Rock Paper Shotgun considered the narrative to do a \"great job of replicating insular music scenes\" and their interpersonal dynamics, and containing a \"personal touch\" and \"heart\" that motivated her to engage with the gameplay. At first considering the game's mechanics to be \"awkward\" and a \"clash of story and action\", Declan Taggart of Unwinnable Monthly expressed admiration for the game's depiction of a specific and nostalgic era through its narrative fragments. Taggart considered the game succeeded in \"creating an authentic-feeling past where other games with similar aims might not\", citing the narrative's \"bittersweet quality\", avoidance of sentimentality by depicting \"addiction, personal and interpersonal chaos\", and leaving open loose ends of the narrative. Gaming journalist John Walker considered the game to be a \"satisfying\" and \"clever\" title, highlighting the extraordinary aspect of the \"entirely imagined\" concept, music, radio interviews being co-ordinated by a one-man development team. Several critics compared the game's concept to the 2018 title Return of the Obra Dinn, an investigative puzzle game with similar game mechanics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJackson, Gita (19 November 2020). \"Wilco-Inspired Mystery Game Tries to Show Why Your Favorite Bands Break Up\".

        "content": "The David family murder–suicide refers to a familicide which took place in Salt Lake City, United States, on the morning of August 3, 1978, in which Rachal David (1939–1978) pushed several of her children off an International Dunes Hotel 11th floor balcony and convinced at least three of her surviving children to then jump before her to their deaths. A 15-year-old girl survived after spending a year in the hospital. Three days earlier, Rachal's husband Immanuel David (1938–1978) who had said he was a divine leader had died by suicide.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe murder-suicide was related to the family's religious beliefs around Immanuel's divine calling and wanting to follow him to the next life, motivated by loyalty and altruism,: 72  as well as financial concerns.: 68  Immanuel (formerly Charles Bruce Longo before 1970) was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) but was excommunicated in June 1969. Immanuel was introduced to the LDS church while in the US Army. After his time in the military he was a Mormon missionary in Uruguay, after which he and Rachal (formerly Margit Briggita Ericsson) met while enrolled in the LDS Church's largest school Brigham Young University. After they were married and had several children Rachal's husband said he was a prophet and divine figure and developed a group of followers they called Family of David. David died by suicide in Emigration Canyon near Salt Lake City while under FBI investigation for federal wire fraud.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the David family deaths, some of Immanuel's followers continued in the Family of David, and in 2000 some reported awaiting the return of Immanuel. One of those was the surviving daughter now in a wheelchair after surviving the jump, and multiple subsequent suicide attempts.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMormonism and violence\nImmanuel David Isaiah\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Great Outdoors is the 15th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that aired on the Nickelodeon network on 27 March 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy go camping in the woods. The two go skinny-dipping at night, only to joined by Old Man Hunger and his mother, the Fat Lady. Ren tries to start a campfire, but only burns himself instead. Ren is drained dry by mosquitos. Ren contacts Beaver Fever from drinking dirty water, which causes to grow a beaver tail which he uses to attack Stimpy with.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nOld Man Hunger-voice of Billy West\nFat Lady-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was started by the Spümcø studio in 1992. The production was delayed, and the lay-out stage was done at the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul instead of at the Spümcø studio was usual as a cost-saving measure. Vincent Waller was in South Korea supervising the lay-out stage for The Great Outdoors when the Spümcø studio when learned on 21 September 1992 that Spümcø studio had lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show, and that someone else would be finishing The Great Outdoors. Ken Bruce of the Games Animation studio was sent out to replace Waller..\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode was met with a very negative reception in 1993 with many critics condemning Billy West's voice acting as Ren while the general feeling being that John Kricfalusi played Ren much better. The American journalist Thad Komorowski wrote that The Great Outdoors was a weak episode with no real plot, and that the episode \"lacked finesse\" as the artists at Games Animation were clearly not interested in the story.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

After filtering out the barium sulfate, the solution is concentrated to crystallize ytterbium(III) bromate nonahydrate. The nonahydrate is thermally decomposed into anhydride to obtain ytterbium oxybromide.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External reading ==\nSerebrennikov, V. V.; Batyreva, V. A.; Tsybakova, T. N.

        "content": "Wat Chakkrawat  (Thai: วัดจักรวรรดิ, pronounced [wátt͡ɕàk.krā.wàt]) or full name Wat Chakkrawat Rachawat Woramahawihan (วัดจักรวรรดิราชาวาสวรมหาวิหาร, pronounced [wátt͡ɕàk.krā.wàtrāː.t͡ɕʰāːwâːtwɔːráʔmahǎːwíʔhǎːn]) is a Buddhist monastery in Bangkok.\nConsidered to be another Thai temple located in Bangkok's Chinatown apart from the notable Wat Traimit, where the largest gold Buddha statue in the world is housed.  The monastery is in the northwestern edge of Samphanthawong district near the Chao Phraya river.\nFormerly known as Wat Sam Pluem, it is an old temple that was here long before the Yaowarat road was cut in 1892. Its history goes back at least 200 years, from the reign of King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok (Rama I), coinciding with the establishment of Rattanakosin kingdom (now Bangkok) as the new capital of Siam (Thailand in those days) in 1782. At that time the location of the temple called Sampheng, and became the residence of Chinese immigrants after they shifted from Tha Tian quarter. Because the king needs this area to build what is now the Grand Palace.\nIn the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III), Chaophraya Bodindecha renovated the entire temple and dug a khlong (canal)  to convey the water from the temple's pond. The restoration took six years to complete. Monks from the other temples were invited to stay here, and then the temple was presented to the king to make it a royal temple in 1825.\n\nLater, a Buddha statue named Phra Bang was enshrined in the vihara (sanctuary). When the King Nangklao visited the temple for the royal kathin rope ceremony, the king mentioned that the vihara was higher than the ubosot (ordination hall). Chaopraya Bodindecha then built a new the ubosot and changed the old ubosot to be a vihara. In the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV), Phra Bang was sent back to Luang Phrabang in Kingdom of Luang Phrabang (now Laos) until the present, and Phra Nak was brought from Buddhist shrine inside the Grand Palace to replace the statue.\nIn the contemporary era with World War II, in the Chao Phraya river near the temple there was a large crocodile went on a rampage as a man-eater. It was said that it was one-eyed crocodile, so people dubbed it I-bord Wat Sam Pluem (\"the blind of Wat Sam Pluem\"). Its story was well known and greatly feared by the Bangkokian at that time. A chase was launched but they were unable to capture it. Until a monk from Wat Chakkrawat caught and raised it in a pond at the temple until it died naturally. I-bord was rumored to be a haunted crocodile. The crocodile pond still exists in the temple today.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWAT CHAKRAWAT RATCHAWAT WORAMAHAWIHAN วัดจักรวรรดิราชาวาสวรมหาวิหาร French: French",

        "content": "David Pocock is an Australian political party founded in 2022 that serves as a vessel for the Independent ACT Senator, David Pocock. The party was founded prior to the 2022 Australian Senate election in order to give Pocock the ability to have himself promoted above-the-line on the ballot paper. The party's website states that without appearing above-the-line, \"He (Pocock) would have had no chance of winning.\"\nFellow ACT candidate for the Senate, Kim Rubenstein, formed a political party, Kim for Canberra, for the same reasons as David Pocock. David Pocock Party listed Kim for Canberra as its second preference on its how-to-vote card, directly after Pocock himself.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nThe party tends to be left-wing on most issues, exhibiting its main campaign issues as Integrity, Cost of Living, Equality, and Climate Change. This contributed to his election heavily due to Canberra's largely progressive voter base.\n\n\n=== Fake Election signs in the 2022 Australian federal election ===\nDue to Pocock's personal political positions, which can arguably be compared to that of the Greens, during the election campaign, fake signs began appearing around the ACT which were largely alike to those of the true signs, however they represented Pocock wearing a shirt symbolic to the Greens. The authorisation statement, as required by Australian law, read that it was authorised by Advance Australia. Advance is an Australian conservative lobby group, which has loose ties to the Liberal Party of Australia. The signs were also found in the same style to have been faked for fellow teal independents, Zali Steggall and Monique Ryan.\n\n\n== Results in the 2022 Australian federal election ==\n\nDavid Pocock received a total of 15,546 first-preference votes, with his running mate Clare Doube pulling in a mere 93 first preferences. Above-the-line voting and single transferable vote counting pulling the party up to a single quota allowing for the election of David Pocock.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fake Dad is the 14th episode of the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that aired on the Nickelodeon network on 27 February 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are once more engaged in a dubious business scheme, this time working for the Fake Dad agency where Ren and Stimpy pose as a father to neglected children. Ren and Stimpy adopt a murderous, oversized seven year old Killer Kowalski (named after a professional wrestler of the 1950s) who is on parole for crimes against humanity for the weekend. Ren and Stimpy take Kowalski home where his great strength, immaturity and limited intelligence led for him to cause all sorts of destruction. At the end of weekend, Ren Kowlaski returns to prison while Ren embraces Stimpy in relief that he is gone.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of John Kricfalusi\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nKiller Kowalski-voice of Harris Peet\nFake Dad Agent-voice of Billy west\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe script for Fake Dad had been written by John Kricfalusi and Jim Smith of the Spümcø studio in late 1991 for the second season of The Ren & Stimpy Show set for 1992–1993. The production was greatly delayed at the Spümcø throughout 1992, and by the time the Spümcø studio lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show on 21 September 1992, only the lay-out stage had been completed. Kricfalusi and Smith were considered to be the only cartoonists at Spümcø capable of drawing Killer Kowlaski, who was considered a difficult character to draw.  After the Spümcø studio lost the contract, Fake Dad was assigned to the Game Animation studio who finished it in the fall of 1992. Smith and Kricfalusi had wanted Fake Dad to be half an hour long, but Games shorted the story to 11 minutes. Both Kricfalusi and Smith were unhappy about the decision to abridge Fake Dad. Smith stated of the abridgment that his cartoon was \"taken over by uncaring people who shoved it through\". The Games Animation studio added an American football game to the Fake Dad, but Jim Ballantine stated that the padding made Fake Dad \"slow and unwatchable\", hence the football game was cut from the version that was aired in 1993.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowksi praised Kricfalusi's voice acting as Ren in Fake Dad that \"blends genuine vexation and remorse\" as Ren comes to care for Killer Kowalski while feeling guilty about his greed, which was reason for wanting to play a \"fake dad\" in the first place.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDobbs, G.

        "content": "Girish Raya Chodankar (born 25 July 1966 or 1967) is an Indian politician and teacher who serves as the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Tripura, Sikkim, Manipur, and Nagaland since 2023. He previously served as the president of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) from 2018 to 2022. A former AICC secretary, in 2023, he was appointed as a permanent invitee of the Congress Working Committee (CWC).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGirish Raya Chodankar was born on either 25 July 1966 or 1967. He is the child of Raya Chodankar. He obtained his Master of Commerce (M.Com.) degree with a specialization in Business Management from Goa University in 1990. Subsequently, in 1993, he completed his Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) degree with a focus on Commerce I & ii from Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nChodankar embarked on his political journey within the Indian National Congress (INC), assuming the role of booth president for the Comba, Goa booth in Fatorda during the period of 1989–1990. He subsequently rose through the ranks of the party, holding positions such as general secretary and president of the Fatorda Block Youth Congress Committee. In 2018, Chodankar's contributions were recognized when he was appointed as the president of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC). Chodankar's political involvement began in 1995 when he successfully contested the Margao Municipal Council election and secured a seat representing the Comba ward. In 1998, he assumed the position of general secretary of the Goa Pradesh Youth Congress Committee (GPYCC). Notably, Chodankar served as the president of the Goa Pradesh Youth Congress Committee from 2000 to 2008, further solidifying his involvement to the party's youth wing. Before being appointed to the highest decision-making body of the Congress party, Chodankar held the position of a secretary in the All India Congress Committee (AICC). He assumed this role in June 2013 and worked closely with the office of Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader within the party. Prior to his tenure as AICC secretary, Chodankar was stationed at the AICC secretariat in New Delhi from 2011 onwards. Chodankar's responsibilities extended to his position as the AICC in-charge of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI). During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in establishing and strengthening student bases in various states, notably achieving success in student council elections at Delhi University. In May 2017, Chodankar was selected to be a part of the AICC committee established by Rahul Gandhi. The committee's purpose was to choose the president of NSUI using an open application process.\nChodankar served as the chief of the Goa Pradesh Youth Congress Committee (GPYCC), where he played a pivotal role in mobilizing the support of young individuals to strengthen the party's foundation at the grassroots level and facilitate the reconstruction of the party organization. Throughout the period of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) governance in Goa from 2000 to 2005, Chodankar actively engaged with the government on various matters, even in instances where senior party leaders refrained from confronting the then Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrikar. Chodankar has participated in multiple elections as a candidate representing the Indian National Congress. In the 2002 Goa Legislative Assembly election, Chodankar contested from the Margao Assembly constituency; however, he was unsuccessful in securing victory, as he was defeated by the BJP candidate, Digambar Kamat, with a margin of 4,744 votes, consequently placing second. Similarly, during the 2017 by-election for the Panaji Assembly constituency, Chodankar faced defeat against the BJP candidate, Manohar Parrikar, with a margin of 4,803 votes, thereby finishing in the second position. Furthermore, Chodankar also participated in the 2019 Indian general election in Goa, vying for the North Goa Lok Sabha constituency. In this election, he faced defeat against the BJP candidate, Shripad Naik, with a substantial margin of 80,247 votes, ultimately securing the second position.\nFollowing his defeat in the 2017 by-election against Manohar Parrikar, the Chief Minister of Goa at the time, Chodankar characterized the outcome as a dignified conclusion to a formidable struggle. He expressed pride in being selected as a candidate by his party and embracing the challenge of competing against a serving chief minister, as well as contending with the resources and support of the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Chodankar considered his fight to be honorable due to the Congress party's commitment to democratic values by actively engaging in the electoral process. As of April 2018, Chodankar is employed as a teacher at a higher secondary school in Curchorem. In preparation for his election campaign in 2019, Chodankar announced his intention to highlight the deficiencies of Shripad Naik, a four-time Member of Parliament and the Union Minister of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH). During his campaign, he initiated a bicycle journey through different districts in North Goa as part of his strategic efforts to connect with voters in the region.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 15 November 1998, Chodankar married Sunita, a private insurance agent. As of December 2023, he resides in the Gogol suburb of Margao. On 10 February 2021, Chodankar's father, Raya, aged 82, died to COVID-19 at the Goa Medical College in Bambolim. He had been under medical care at the hospital since the 17 January from the previous month.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Undelya (Minnie) Apma (c.1909 - 14 August 1990) was a Arrernte domestic servant who was born at Horseshoe Bend Station in the Northern Territory.\nAs a young girl she was adopted by Herbert Basedow, in order to work within his household, and lived in Adelaide for much of her life.\nShe is a member of the Stolen Generations.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nApma was the fourth child of Charley Apma (Apmwe) Pelharre who was from the Jay Creek area and Joulta, a Traditional owner for Imarnte.\nIn May 1920, when Apma was 11, the family were living at Crown Point Station where, soon after (in June 1920) they met with Herbert Basedow. Basedow had travelled, alongside his wife Olive (Nell), to document the medical condition of Aboriginal people in the area and, through this, examined Apma and her father. Afterwards, when Charley was away from the station, Basedow took Apma from there and planned to adopt her and take her to Adelaide.\nWhen they left Crown Point Station they were planning to first stop in Alice Springs but, while they were travelling there, in a camel-drawn buggy, damage occurred and they had to stop at Hermannsburg (Ntaria) to make repairs. The people at Hermannsburg were worried for Apma, who appeared very sad, and decided that she needed a friend of her own age for company on the journey and 12 year-old Luritja girl Tjikana (Tjikarna) Cooper was chosen to travel with her. Frieda Strehlow wrote in her diary about the exchange that the Basedow's \"want to take the two girls with them to the south, female servants are too dear: 30 shillings a week”.\nOnce in Alice Springs an agreement was made between Basedow and Robert Stott, with whom they were staying, to adopt the girls and train them in domestic duties and they were both taken to Adelaide and to the Basedow's house in Kent Town.\nThere were several investigations into the circumstances of Apma and Cooper's removal and, in response to accusations that the girls were adopted for the purposes of scientific study it was the response of the Basedow's that the girls where adopted \"in a spirit of friendship\" as they had no children of their own and that \"the plight of the two appealed to them\". Despite this many were convinced that the girls were primarily brought in as domestic labour and treated as such and, in 1929, a photo of them (alongside Basedow) was printed in The Register News-Pictorial, which stated they were servants.\nIn 1922, Frederic Urquhart the Administrator of the Northern Territory, prompted by Charley Apma, contacted the Police Commissioner of South Australia and noted that:\n\n[While the girls] removals were sanctioned officially at the time … a doubt seems now to have arisen as to whether they went voluntarily with Dr Basedow and whether they are now well and happy\nFollowing this inquiry a police constable visited the home and reported that the girls were well and happy.\nLater, in 1928, Apma's father Charley contacted Basedow directly via telegram demanding that his daughter be returned. He said:\n\nI am … proper Father Alonga Minnie—my girl you been taken from New Crown … you send em back quick—please\nOnce again further inquiries were made but no action was taken and, in 1930, John Henry Sexton, Secretary of the Aborigines' Friends' Association, added to these complaints.\nWhen Herbert Basedow died in 1933 the grief of Ampa and Cooper, now in their early 20s, was reported the The Mail (Adelaide) which referred to them both as \"two sad-eyed native girls\" and that they \"deeply mourned the untimely death of Dr. Basedow, and refused to eat for two days\". This article also reported that they would both stay with Nell Besedow, however, soon after they were 'given' to Basedow's unmarried sisters; Blanca, Elsa and Hedwig.\nLittle is known of their lives during this time, however, it is known that Apma had two children: Charlie who was born in 1942, who was taken by Basedow's sisters to raise as their own, and Margaret who was born in 1943, who was sent to the Colebrook Home.\nKanakiya Myra Ah Chee remembers visiting her Apma, when \"only Hedwig was left\", and said that she would knock on the door and:\n\nHedwig would answer but not come out. She'd only peep around the corner and then vanish, and Minnie and Tjikana would come out and get me.\nShe also recalled that many family members would visit them there, sometimes as boarders when working in Adelaide, as the house was so large that it could easily accommodate everybody.\nIn 1958 Apma was able to return to Central Australia where she was able to reunite with her daughter Margaret; he parents had already died. During this time Apma spent many years visiting with extended family throughout Central Australia \nApma died in Alice Springs on 14 August 1990 and is buried at Alice Springs Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

Certain eery happenings electrify the household—a dog has its throat torn out, a flute is heard playing in the rain, a man dies in the spinney of shock, a girl is bemused by something she has seen.

        "content": "Eishin Flash（Japanese: エイシンフラッシュ, foaled March 27, 2007） is a retired Japanese thoroughbred race horse.His major wins include the 2010 Tōkyō Yūshun and the 2012 Autumn Tenno Sho, as well as the 2010 Keisei Hai and 2013 Mainichi Okan.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 2009: Two-year old season ===\nEishin Flash debuted at a debut race for 2 year olds of 1800 meters (turf) on July 12 at Hanshin, where the horse finished in 6th place with Yuichi Fukunaga riding him. Two months later, the horse won his first race at another maiden race held at Kyoto, this time with Hiroyuki Uchida as his jockey. Fukunaga once again became the horse's jockey later at the Hagi Stakes but finished 3rd. Later on, with Uchida back as jockey, Eishin Flash won the Erika Sho, leading to Uchida becoming the main jockey.\n\n\n=== 2010: Three-year old season ===\nAt the Keisei Hai, because Uchida was injured in another race, Norihiro Yokoyama briefly took over the role of jocket. Eishin Flash was nonetheless the most favored to win owing to the Erika Sho victory, and subsequently won the race, making it his first graded race victory. Later, the horse was scheduled to run the Wakaba Stakes but was forced to skip the race as the horse contracted pneumonia.The horse was then sent to the Satsuki Shō, where he was the 11th most favored to win but managed to finish 3rd, securing priority entry to the Japanese Derby.\nAt the 77th Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) the horse was the 7th most favored to win. The horse ran in the middle of the pack, which covered the first 1000 meters at a slow pace of 1:01.6 and the first mile 1:41.6. As the pack entered the final stretch, the horse took the lead, running the last three furlongs at a record breaking 32.7 seconds, and held on to the lead across the finish line even as Rose Kingdom closed in. This marked the first Tokyo Yushun victory for both Uchida, trainer Hideaki Fujiwara, and owner Toyomitsu Hirai. ==\nLater on in Autumn, the horse was entered in to the Kobe Shimbun Hai with the Kikka Sho in mind. However, the horse was beaten by the winner, Rose Kingdom, by a neck. The horse was still scheduled to run, but a few days before the race, the vet that checked the horse noticed symptoms of muscle pain and the plans to enter the horse in the race were scrapped at the last minute. Later on, the horse was sent to run in the Japan Cup and Arima Kinen but finished unplaced in both races.\n\n\n=== 2011: Four-year old season ===\nEishin Flash started the 2011 season with the Osaka Hai, but finished third behind Hiruno d'Amour. Later on, the horse ran the Spring Tenno Sho, but finished 2nd to Hiruno d'Amour again. Later at Takarazuka Kinen, Katsumi Ando took over the role of jockey following another accident that left Uchida injured. At Takarazuka, the horse finished third behind Earnestly.In Autumn, the horse was entered in to the Autumn Tenno Sho, with Christophe Lemaire as jockey, where he finished 6th. The horse was unplaced in Japan Cup, and at Arima Kinen the horse finished 2nd behind Orfevre.\n\n\n=== 2012: Five-year old season ===\nEishin Flash was one of three Japanese horses that was entered in to that year's Dubai World Cup, together with Transcend and Smart Falcon, where he finished 6th, which was the best of those three. After returning to Japan, he was entered in to the Takarazuka Kinen with Uchida returning as jockey, but finished 6th, with the 5th place horse beating him by 5 lengths. After a summer break, the horse started off unplaced in the Mainichi Okan, but at the Autumn Tenno Sho, which became the first Tenno Sho in 7 years to be attended by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, the horse won his first race in 13 starts, and his second Grade I race since the Japanese Derby. Following the race, Eishin Flash's jockey, Mirco Demuro, dismounted from the horse, removed his helmet, and knelt in front of the Emperor and Empress.On the horse's final race of the season, the Arima Kinen, Demuro was diagnosed with ureteral stones and Kousei Miura took over the role of jockey on the day of the race. At the race, the horse briefly took over the lead briefly but finished fourth.\n\n\n=== 2013: Six-year old season ===\nAs Toyomitsu Hirai passed away on the March 2, ownership of the horse was transferred to Katsuhiko, his second born son. As for the horse himself, the horse started the season with the Osaka Hai on March 31, but finished 3rd behind Orfevre. After this, the horse was sent to Hong Kong to race the Queen Elizabeth II Cup with Mirco Demuro, where he finished 3rd behind Military Attack, who finished a length and three-quarters in front of him. After a five and a half months long break, he was entered in to the Mainichi Okan and won. He was then entered to the Tenno Sho (Autumn) to win the race once again, but finished third. He later finished 10th in the Japan Cup. He was planned to run in the Arima Kinen as his final race, but his gait showed signs of problems, and as a result the horse was scratched. In spite of this, a retirement ceremony was still held at Nakayama Racecourse.\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nFollowing his retirement, he stood stud at Shadai Stallion Station, before being transferred to Lex Stud in late 2018. As of 2024, the horse is standing stud at Lex Stud for a service fee of 800,000 JPY.\n\n\n=== Notable progeny ===\nc = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\n\n\n== Racing form ==\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Seamount microbial communities refer to microorganisms living within the surrounding environment of seamounts. Seamounts are often called the hotspot of marine life serving as a barrier that disrupts the current and flow in the ocean, which is referred to as the seamount effect.Around 25 million seamounts are known to exist, however, the research on microbial communities are focused on volcanically active seamounts. The microbial interactions with marine life, such as sponges and corals, demonstrates the potential importance of microbes in the foundational success of seamount communities.\n\n\n== Overview of Seamounts and the Significance of Microbial Communities ==\nSeamounts are submarine mountains which are widely prevalent across the globe, often with an active hydrothermal system. Seamounts also contribute to the global circulation of oceanic primary productivity as biodiversity hotspots, enhancing biomass and species diversity within and beyond marine ecosystems. Their distinctive topographies alter the regional oceanic circulation, resulting in upwelling that transport nutrient-rich water from deep ocean to the surface. This results in unique habitats that sustain the lives of marine organisms, including a diverse range of microbial communities. These unique features of seamounts overall contribute significantly to biogeochemical cycles, particularly due to the involvement of microbial communities in nutrient recycling. Given that microbes are most abundant in aquatic environments, seamounts serve as an excellent focus for research.\n\n\n=== Geological Features and Distribution of Seamounts ===\nSeamounts are primarily formed due to underwater volcanic and tectonic activities beneath the ocean floor at the plate boundaries of lithosphere. Additionally, mid-ocean ridges at divergent plate boundaries are common locations for high-temperature hydrothermal venting, which are distinctive habitats, especially to many chemoautotrophic microbes. However, these systems tend to be more uniform in their physical and chemical characteristics compared to vent systems found near volcanic arcs and back-arc regions. Seamounts features a variety of geological characteristics that affect hydrodynamic conditions in a local and regional scale, thus impacting the entire marine ecosystem globally.The diverse landscapes of seamounts, from cone-shaped to chain-like formations with multiple summits, influence the hydrodynamic patterns which define the distribution and composition of microbial communities within the regions, as observed in the environments of Seine and Sedlo seamounts. Research on various seamounts, such as Kocebu Guyot, the seamounts in the South China Sea, and those like Sedlo and Seine, shows a notable influence on the diversity of habitats and seasonal changes in microbial populations. The variety of microbes found on seamounts is often correlated with levels of Total Organic Carbon (TOC), where higher TOC concentrations are associated with a richer microbial diversity. Specific microbial groups, like Zetaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, are predominant in certain seamount areas, their presence shaped by the unique geochemical conditions resulting from the geological activities of the seamounts. This phenomenon, known as the 'seamount effect', alters the patterns of ocean currents, leading to enhanced biodiversity and increased ecological productivity. This makes seamounts critical study areas for understanding the patterns and structures of microbial communities.\n\n\n== Diversity ==\n\n\n=== Habitat diversity ===\nDiversity and connectivity of bacteria, protists, and fungi was investigated through studies around  the Kocebu Guyot in the Magellan Seamount chain in western Pacific Ocean. The studies showed that bacterial communities had higher interlayer connectivity than protists and fungi. Fungi appeared to have the lowest connectivity of the three groups. The seamount notably decreased the protist connectivity in the horizontal scale, while increasing vertical connectivity for both bacteria and protists, creating ecological opportunities for species' diversity. The differences observed between bacteria and protists may be due to bacteria's smaller size and free dispersal. This study in the Magellan Seamount observes an unusual finding regarding protists, where protists show the highest diversity in deeper water layers. Typically, eukaryotic diversity tends to be lower in deep water layers due to food limitation.Microbial community dominance around the South China Sea (SCS) seamounts was investigated through examining the similarities and differences of seamount and non-seamount sites. Low microbial diversity is associated with low Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentration in deep waters, while high microbial diversity correlates with high TOC in shallow waters. In both seamount and non-seamount sites, Thaumarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, Planctomycetota, Bacteroidota, and Acidobacteriota were identified. The dominant microbial communities in SCS seamounts included Nitrosopumilales, Alteromonadales, Anaerolineales, Rhodobacterales, Flavobacteriales, Steroidobacterales, and “Candidatus Actinomarinales.” These microbes were not exclusive to SCS seamounts as they were also found in non-seamount sediments. In seamount seafloor ecosystems, Oceanospirillales, Corynebacteriales, Rhodobacterales, S085, and Kordiimonadales are the dominant microbial communities.In volcanically active seamounts, within the surface hydrothermal vents, Zetaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria are the dominant microbial communities. Archaea are not abundant in this habitat, except in the Mariana forearc, where they dominate. Epsilonproteobacteria and Zetaproteobacteria are rare in the seawater surrounding seamounts. In general, microbial communities are influenced by the geochemistry shaped by the seamount geological processes.\n\n\n=== Seasonal diversity ===\nDuring all seasons, heterotrophic microbial communities dominate for both Seine and Sedlo seamounts. The autotrophic community of both seamounts are primarily composed of small cells. In winter, Prochlorococcus-2 existed on both seamounts.\n\n\n==== Seine ====\nThe Seine region is in close proximity to the African coast. This area exhibits regional strong upwelling that provides ideal conditions for larger phytoplanktons.During springtime, the Seine seamount has more contributions from nanoplankton and microphytoplankton, however, less from picoplankton. The integrated abundance of Picoeukaryotes and Synechococcus is highest in spring as well. Comparably, the Prochlorococcus dominates in summer and winter.\n\n\n==== Sedlo ====\nIn winter, the Sedlo seamount experiences more contributions from picophytoplankton near the thermocline. During summer, there is a threefold increase in total heterotrophic activity. The integrated abundance of Synechococcus is high in the southern region of Sedlo, suggesting surface water nutrient enrichment.\n\n\n== Ecological roles of microbial communities ==\n\n\n=== The Seamount Effect ===\nThe seamount effect is the principle that the topography of seamounts disrupts the oceanic flow in their area. Due to increased turbulence in the water, this phenomenon results in a greater amount of particulate organic matter (POC) coming down from the surface ocean, which fuels higher biodiversity and production rates than surrounding areas. Seamounts have a higher biodiversity than both coastal and open oceans, but this decreases with distance. Increased production rates lead to increased community growth, especially for unrelated organisms. A large community means that an abundance of niches are occupied, some of which include consuming the waste that is produced when organic matter is consumed.\n\n\n=== Sediment Communities ===\nThe microbial communities that thrive within the sediments of seamounts differ from those which occupy the sediments in non-seamount areas throughout the world's oceans. Many sediments have ferromanganese crusts, which include ammonia, that can be used as an electron donor for growth. The sediments at the surface of seamounts house more heterotrophs than autotrophs as a result of the large amounts of POC that become trapped within the sediments following turbulence created by the seamount effect.\n\n\n=== Trophic Transfer and Consumption ===\nThe high production levels present in seamounts contribute to a substantial food source for larger organisms, providing sustenance to higher trophic levels. Food sources also come from a disruption in the diel vertical migration (DVM) cycle, as zooplankton which descend back into the deep ocean in at daybreak following their daily cycle can become trapped by high points on the seamount, where they become a prey item for larger consumers. Both pelagic and benthic organisms are found in seamounts as part of their diverse biological communities. When the water flow is changed, it moves microorganisms horizontally between regions of the seamount, further increasing community biodiversity, but also increasing ecological interactions between different trophic levels.\n\n\n== Interactions with other Marine Life ==\nThe topographical effects on physical oceanography can boost diversity, enhance biomass, and alter production levels. In biologically abundant seamounts, microbes are no strangers to interacting with other marine life forms.\nSponges and corals are two of many organisms that find water movements in seamounts favorable. As they grow abundant, their encounter with seamount microbes gets more prevalent. Some sponges can be categorized as high-microbial abundance species, harboring up to 100 million microbes g-1 of sponge tissue. This relationship provides mutually beneficial interactions, such as those related to metabolism, nutrient availability,and microbe protection.Although coral-microbe interaction studies specifically in seamount environments are limited, corals in other deep sea environments also exhibit such important relationships. These mutually beneficial interactions include those related to nutrient availability, anti-pathogen protection, and microbe protection.Although other seamount microbe-marine life interactions are currently very limited,  the microbial life supports higher levels of biodiversity through sponges and corals. These two are foundational organisms that provide substrate stability, allowing other life forms to exist in that environment. With the right conditions, these can flourish into a web of complex ecology indirectly supported by microbes.\n\n\n== References ==",

When a succession dispute occurred between Bonewamang Padi Sechele and Moruakgomo Sechele in 1962, Mack supported Moruakgomo to be kgosi. Though he was the son of a kgosi, Mack did not challenge the seniority of his nephews when they were considered potential heirs.\nNeale Sechele was chosen as kgosi in 1963, and Mack became his deputy chief the following year. As Neale had little interest in governing, Mack effectively managed the tribe until the end of his tenure in 1969. Neale's successor Bonewamang died 1978, and Mack was appointed as the district's African Tribal Authority to serve as a regent for Bonewamang's son Kgari Sechele III. Mack resigned in 1986 and was succeeded by his son Moithali Sechele II. His elder son Sentibile did not succeed him due to questions about his legitimacy.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRamsay, Jeff (1996). \"The Fall and Decline of the Bakwena Monarchy\".

        "content": "William Francis Fielder Jr. (June 5, 1920 – June 30, 1943) was an American fighter pilot during World War II. He holds the distinction of being the only American fighter pilot to become a flying ace in the Bell P-39 Airacobra.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFiedler was born on June 5, 1920, in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up at Akron, Ohio. He graduated from Central High School in Akron and then enrolled in Ohio Northern University where he attended for one year and was a quarterback on the football team.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nFollowing United States entry into World War II following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Fiedler enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces on December 21 at Fort Hayes, Ohio as an aviation cadet. He completed flight training, and earned wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.\n\nAfter completion of flight training, he was sent to Nadi, Fiji and was assigned as a Bell P-39 Airacobra pilot with the 70th Fighter Squadron of the 347th Fighter Group. In January 1943, the 347th FG was assigned to the Thirteenth Air Force and was stationed at Henderson Field in Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands during the Solomon Islands campaign. On January 26, while flying a patrol over Choiseul Island, he and his wingman spotted a Kawanishi H6K 'Mavis' flying boat. Both the pilots made a low approach and strafing pass at the flying boat, resulting in substantial damage and subsequent sinking of the H6K. Then, the escorting Mitsubishi A6M 'Zeroes' noticed the P-39 and then intercepted the P-39s, shooting down Fielder's wingman. In the subsequent dogfight, Fiedler managed to down one Zero and returned to base safely.\n\nOn February 4, 1943, during an interception of 25 Zeroes flying cover for Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers evacuating exhausted Japanese troops from Guadalcanal, Fiedler shot down a Zero just north of Kolombangara Island, his second aerial victory. He was assigned to the 68th Fighter Squadron and on June 12, while intercepting a formation of Zeroes conducting a fighter sweep over Russell Islands, he shot down one of them ten miles of Cape Esperance, his third aerial victory.\nOn June 30, 1943, after being alerted by an Australian coast watcher on Vella Lavella of a formation 38 Zeroes along with 30 other Zeroes escorting a formation of Aichi D3A 'Val' dive bombers to attack US Navy transports off Guadalcanal, Fielder along with five other P-39 pilots flew to intercept the formation. In the dogfight, he shot down two Vals, with the second one with only .30 caliber wing guns of his P-39. With a total of five aerial victories, this earned him the title of flying ace and only American pilot to earn so while flying the P-39.\nOn June 30, 1943, while onboard his P-39 waiting to depart for combat mission from Henderson Field, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning, suffering from engine failure, landed on same runway and collided with the P-39, causing both aircraft to explode. Fiedler was pulled from the wreckage unconscious and died hours later while being treated at a field hospital.\n\n\n== Military decorations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStanaway, John (2001).

        "content": "William Arthur James Wallace  (4 January 1842 – 6 February 1902) was an Irish army officer and engineer in India.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWallace was born at Kingstown, County Dublin, on 4 January 1842. He was the son of William James Wallace, J.P., of co. Wexford. Educated at private schools and at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the royal engineers on 19 December 1860. After two years' instruction at Chatham and two years' service at home stations, Wallace in 1864 joined the railway branch of the public works department in India. He became an executive engineer in 1871, then deputy consulting engineer for guaranteed railways administered from Calcutta. Promoted captain on 25 August 1873, and appointed officiating consulting engineer to the government of India at Lucknow in 1877, he went to Europe in 1878 in connection with the railway exhibits to the Paris Exhibition, and on his return to India in the autumn was appointed secretary to the railway conference at Calcutta. He worked out the details of a policy, advocated at the conference, of vigorous railway construction in India, a result of experience gained in the recent famine.\nAt the end of 1878 Wallace received the thanks of the commander-in-chief, Sir Frederick Haines, for conducting the transport of General Sir Donald Stewart's division over 300 miles of new railway on the Indus Valley line between Multan and Sakkar, on its march to Kandahar. Serving under Sir Frederick Roberts as field engineer to the Kuram Valley column in the Afghan campaign of 1879, Wallace was mentioned in despatches, and commended for his work on road-making and for his energy and skill in the management of the Ahmed Khel Jagis. He received the medal.\nReturning from active service to railway work in August, he was appointed engineer-in-chief and manager of the northern Bengal railway at Saidpur, was promoted major on 1 July, and arrived home on furlough in June 1882. On the recommendation of Major-general Sir Andrew Clarke, inspector-general of fortifications, Wallace was made director of a new railway corps, formed of the 8th company of royal engineers, to work the Egyptian railways in the coming Egyptian war. The railway corps contributed largely to the success of the operations in Egypt. The advance from Ismailia was mainly dependent on the transport by railway of supplies, which amounted to 100 tons daily, while another 100 tons had to be stored at the advanced depots at Kassassin and Mahuta (see Report, Professional Papers of the Royal Engineers, vol. ix.). Wallace's improvised corps proved how essential in war such an organisation was, and led to its establishment in the service in an expanded form and on a more permanent basis. Wallace was present at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir on 13 September 1882, and for his services in the campaign was mentioned in despatches, and received a brevet lieut.-colonelcy ion 18 November 1882, medal with clasp, the 4th class of the Osmanieh, and the Khedive's bronze star.\nReturning to India in October 1884, Wallace was appointed acting chief engineer to the government of India for guaranteed railways at Lahore. In the spring of the following year, when the Penjdeh incident in Central Asia caused great preparations to be made for war with Russia, Wallace was appointed controller at Lahore of military troops and stores traffic for the frontier. The Afghanistan boundary question was settled in September 1885, but Wallace remained at Lahore as chief engineer for guaranteed railways until his transference to Agra in April 1886. A brevet colonelcy was given to him on 18 November, and in the following year he returned to Lahore as chief engineer of the north-western railway.\nIn 1888 Wallace reported for the government of India on the Abt system of railways in Switzerland. On 1 January 1890 he was made C.I.E. He retired from the service on 19 Dec. 1892. He died unmarried at Elm Park Gardens, London, on 6 February 1902.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1912). \"Wallace, William Arthur James\".

        "content": "The 2024 WrestleDream is the upcoming second WrestleDream professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It will take place on October 12, 2024, at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington, marking AEW's second PPV to be held in the state of Washington. The event will be a tribute show in honor of New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) founder Antonio Inoki.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nOn October 1, 2022 (September 30 in Eastern Time), Antonio Inoki, the founder of the Japanese professional wrestling promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), died. Prior to his death, the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) began a working partnership with NJPW in early 2021. This resulted in the annual co-promoted event, AEW x NJPW: Forbidden Door, which was first held in June 2022.\nThe inaugural WrestleDream event took place on October 1, 2023—the one-year anniversary of Inoki's passing—at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington, marking AEW's first PPV to be held in the state of Washington. The name of the event refers to Inoki, who Khan called \"wrestling's greatest dreamer\". On April 11, 2024, AEW announced that the second WrestleDream would take place on October 12, 2024, at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington, thus establishing WrestleDream as an annual PPV event.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nWrestleDream will feature professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines. Storylines are produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll Elite Wrestling Official Website",

He defeated his nearest opponent, Nelson Rockefeller, (who was a write-in candidate) by 67 percentage points.

He is currently a member and deputy speaker of the Jakarta Regional House of Representatives, first being elected into the body in 2019. He is part of the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKhoirudin was born in Jakarta on 8 July 1966. He is of Betawi descent, with his grandfather being a Quran reading teacher. He studied in state-funded schools in Jakarta, before enrolling at the Jakarta State University in 1986. He graduated in 1992.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter he graduated from UNJ, Khoirudin became a teacher at a middle school in West Jakarta. He then moved to another middle school in South Jakarta, becoming the school's principal in 1999 and remaining until 2012. He also taught at an Islamic Institute in Depok. By 2006, he had become a member of the Prosperous Justice Party and was chairman of its South Jakarta branch, and in 2015 he was elected as deputy chairman of the party's Jakarta branch. In 2013, he led a demonstration against a decision by president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to increase the price of subsidized gasoline.\nKhoirudin ran for a seat in the Jakarta Regional House of Representatives in the 2019 election from the 7th district which covered Setiabudi, Mampang Prapatan, Kebayoran Baru, Cilandak, and Pancoran. He won 16,431 votes, and was elected as PKS' sole representative in the district. On 2 June 2022, he was appointed to replace Abdurrahman Suhaimi as a deputy speaker of the body. PKS officials cited a party policy of \"refreshment\" for the replacement. At that time, Khoirudin was chairman of PKS' Jakarta branch. He was reelected from the same district in 2024, winning 23,377 votes.\nAs a legislator, Khoirudin has called for Jakarta's provincial government to increase subsidies for education, food, and to laborers, citing the high cost of living.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1988, a 17-year-old student, Jason Dooley, drowned during one of McInnes' training exercises, when he forced a group of students to swim in the Waiwera River while shooting a firearm in their direction. Following Dooley's death, McInnes was criticized for what was deemed extreme training exercises, including having students shave their heads and swear allegiance to him. McInnes was not charged for Dooley's death, but in 1989 he was sentenced to \"10 months' periodic detention for discharging a weapon likely to endanger the life of his students\".\nIn 1992, McInnes immigrated to Thailand.\nIn 2010, McInnes was charged with impersonating a SWAT officer in Pattaya, Thailand, and illegal possession of a firearm.\n\n\n== Business ==\nMcInnes is founder of The World Kumite Organization (WKO) and Shorin Kempo Kaikan. He owns company ISS Corporation Co.,Ltd Thailand.\n\n\n== References ==",

From the Foudroyant he was sent in the following year to North America in the Diamond frigate, and from her was transferred to the Sultan, in which he was present in the action off Grenada, 6 July 1779. In 1780 he was for some time in the Sandwich, bearing Sir George Rodney's flag, and was appointed from her to the Intrepid as acting lieutenant, in which capacity he was present in the action off Martinique, 30 April 1781, and in that off the Capes of Virginia, 5 September 1781. He was not confirmed in his rank till 18 April 1782. In 1793 he was appointed to the Boyne, flagship of Sir John Jervis in the West Indies, and was promoted by the admiral to the command of the Nautilus, 9 January 1794. He was then employed on shore at the reduction of Martinique, and on 25 March 1794 was posted to the command of the Bienvenu, prize-frigate, from which he was moved in rapid succession to the Veteran of 64 guns and the Alarm of 32. He continued actively employed in the West Indies till the following year, when he returned to England. In 1799 he was appointed to the Leviathan of 74 guns, bearing Sir John Duckworth's flag in the Mediterranean and afterwards in the West Indies, whence he was compelled to invalid; and, taking a passage home in a merchant ship, he was captured by a French man-of-war and carried to Spain as a prisoner. He was, however, shortly afterwards exchanged through the exertions of Lord St. Vincent, and for a short time had command of the San Josef. From 1803 to 1810 he had charge of the Devonshire Sea Fencibles, and in 1811 went out to Newfoundland in the Antelope, again as flag-captain to Sir J. T. Duckworth. It was only for a year, for on 12 August 1812 he became a rear-admiral. He had no further service, but was advanced in course of seniority to be vice-admiral on 12 August 1819, and admiral on 10 January 1837. He died on 16 March 1845.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1887). \"Carpenter, James\".

        "content": "United States military bases were established in the Philippines on the basis of a treaty signed after the conclusion of World War II and the recognition of Philippine independence by the US. The bases established under that treaty were discontinued in 1991 and 1992, after the senate of the Philippines narrowly rejected a new treaty which would have allowed some of the bases to continue for another ten years. This article summarizes the collective history of those bases.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nOn June 29, 1944, with WW-II still underway in both the European and Pacific theatres, a Joint Resolution of the US Congress authorized the President of the United States to acquire bases for the mutual protection of the Philippines.\nOn July 28, 1945, the Congress of the Philippines unanimously approved Joint Resolution No. 4, which authorized the President of the Philippines to enter into negotiations for the establishment of such bases. At that time, the Philippine islands were still occupied by Japan and the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines was seated in the US, in exile.\n\nOn October 20, 1944, the Commonwealth government returned to the Philippines as President Sergio Osmeña returned to the Philippines with the US Sixth Army as the US Philippines campaign to liberate the Philippines began.\nOn March 26, 1947, a Military Bases Agreement (MBA) between the Philippines and the US concerning military bases entered into force. That agreement was to remain in force for 99 years and granted the right to retain the use of the following bases, with some restrictions:\n\nThat agreement also specified that the Philippine government would permit the US, upon notice, to use such of the following bases as the US determined that to be required by military necessity:\n\n\n== During the postwar era ==\nIn 1958, the US relinquished the Manila Military Port area, the only remaining American military installation in Manila\nIn 1959, the Bohlen-Serrano Agreement shortened base leaseholds from 99 to 25 years, terminated US control over Olongapo, and limited US military holdings to a few minor installations and four major bases: Clark Air Base in Pampanga, two main naval bases at Sangley Point in Cavite and Subic Bay in Zambales, and recreational Camp John Hay in Baguio City. With this agreement, the leasehold termination date changed from 2046 to 1991, with renewal options.\n\n\n== During the Marcos dictatorship ==\n\n\n== During and after the People Power Revolution ==\n\n\n== Final years of the bases treaty ==\n\n\n=== Renegotiation and proposed new treaty ===\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the US government and Philippine government began intense negotiations to renegotiate the terms of an extension of the military bases at Subic and Clark, because the MBA of 1947 was due to expire. One bone of contention on the part of the negotiators was the amount of money that the US government would pay to the Philippine government for the lease and use of the bases, but the bases had also become a political liability for the Aquino government, with the Los Angeles Times noting that \"many Filipinos denounce the bases as an affront to Philippine sovereignty, remnants of American paternalism and colonialism.\"\nIn July 1991, the US and Philippine negotiators drafted a new agreement titled the Treaty of Friendship, Peace and Cooperation between the two countries, proposing the clean-up and turn over of Clark to the Philippine government in 1992, and extending the lease of Subic Bay Naval Base by the US for ten years.\n\n\n=== Eruption of Mount Pinatubo ===\nThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 influenced the United States' decision to abandon the nearby Clark Air Base, which was heavily damaged by ash emissions and lahar flows. An emergency evacuation of all non-essential military and U.S. Department of Defense civilian personnel and their dependents from Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay ensued.\n\n\n=== Extension Rejection by the Philippine Senate ===\nOn September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected renewal of the bases agreement by a slim margin.  The vote resulted in 11 senators in favor of extending the treaty, and 12 senators in favor of suppressing it. The list of senators who voted for the bases treaty - to retain the bases - were Mamintal Tamano, Neptali Gonzales Sr., Heherson Alvarez, Edgardo Angara, Ernesto Herrera, Jose Lina Jr., John Osmeña, Vicente Paterno, Santanina Rasul, Alberto Romulo and Leticia Ramos Shahani. The Anti-Bases Coalition, founded by senators Jose W. Diokno and Lorenzo Tañada led the call to end American military presence in the country. At the time of the vote, the retired senator Tañada stood up on his wheelchair to rapturous applause shouting, \"Mabuhay!\" or \"Long live the Philippines.\"\n\nDespite further efforts by the Aquino administration to salvage the treaty, the two sides could not reach a new agreement. As a result, the Philippine Government informed the US on December 6, 1991, that it would have one year to complete withdrawal.\n\n\n=== Closure and turnover ===\nOn 26 November 1991, the US government formally turned Clark over to the Philippine government, which transformed the airfield into Clark International Airport. The Subic Bay Naval base was deactivated in 1992. These were the two largest US military bases in the Philippines at the time, and other US bases were deactivated in this same time period, ending the US military presence in the Philippines.\n\n\n== Leftover toxic wastes in Subic and Clark ==\n\nA dispute arose over toxic waste contamination in lark Air Base and Subic Naval Base as soon as the US government turned over the bases to the Philippine government. At the time, U.S. government and United Nations reports confirming serious contamination at 46 locations in the two bases had come out. But the U.S. government determined that it was not legally responsible for the cleanup.\nVarious Philippine administrations have sought to get the US government to take responsibility for the cleanup of the wastes, but to no avail.\n\n\n== Philippines–United States military cooperation after the bases treaty ==\nWhile the end of the US Bases Treaty marked an end to permanent bases, and supposedly the end of permanent US military presence  in the Philippines, the Philippines and the United States later signed a number of agreements for the purpose of facilitating bilateral military cooperation between the two countries. The most significant of these have been the Philippines–United States Visiting Forces Agreement which came into effect in May 1999; and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement which came into effect in April 2014.\n\n\n=== The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement ===\n\nOn\tApril 28, 2014, the Philippines and the US signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), effective for a period of ten years and thereafter, unless terminated by either party by giving one year's written notice. This allowed US forces and contractors to operate out of \"agreed locations\" defined as \"facilities and areas that are provided by the Government of the Philippines through the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)\".\nIn April 2015, the United States government asked for access to eight bases in the Philippines, including the formerly American Subic Bay Naval Base, and Clark Air Base, as well as locations in Luzon, Cebu, and Palawan.\nOn 19 March 2016, the Philippines and the United States government agreed on 5 locations of military bases for the American troops under the EDCA:\n\nAntonio Bautista Air Base (Palawan)\nBasa Air Base (Pampanga)\nBenito Ebuen Air Base (Cebu)\nFort Magsaysay (Nueva Ecija)\nLumbia Airport (Cagayan de Oro)\nIn November 2022, the Philippine Department of National Defense released a statement saying, \"The Department is committed to accelerate the implementation of the Edca by concluding infrastructure enhancement and repair projects, developing new infrastructure projects at existing Edca locations, and exploring new locations that will build a more credible mutual defense posture\".\nOn 2 February 2023, four additional locations of military bases were designated under the EDCA. On 3 April 2023, the locations of the four new EDCA sites were announced:\n\nBalabac Island (Palawan)\nCamp Melchor Dela Cruz (Gamu, Isabela)\nLal-lo Airport (Lal-lo, Cagayan)\nNaval Base Camilo Osias (Santa Ana, Cagayan)\nThe governors of Isabela and Cagayan, which together host three of the bases, expressed dismay at the agreement, stating they had not been consulted on the sites and did not want their provinces to pay too much for the infrastructure improvements or become potential targets of Chinese nuclear attack.\n\n\n== Impact on Ibaloi and Aeta indigenous communities ==\n\nThe establishment of the US bases, particularly of Fort Stotsenberg, Clark Airfield, Subic Bay, and John Hay, frequently resulted in the displacement and disenfranchisement of the Aeta and Ibaloi indigenous peoples who lived in the land, at a time when they were already facing pressures from the incursions of civilian lowlanders. None of these indigenous peoples were properly compensated at the time the bases were established, and they remain marginalized and unable to return to their historic lands today.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhilippines–United States relations\nUnited States military deployments\nNaval Air Station Cubi Point\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRyan, Richard; Villegas, C.

        "content": "James Gifford the younger (20 November 1768 – 20 August 1853) was a British Royal Navy rear admiral.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGifford was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 20 November 1768. He was the son of James Gifford the elder. Having entered the navy in 1783, he served under the broad pennant of Sir Charles Douglas on the Halifax station. He afterwards served in the West Indies, Channel and Mediterranean, and during the occupation of Toulon, in the St. George flagship of Rear-admiral John Gell. In October 1793 he was promoted to be lieutenant, and shortly afterwards was appointed to the Lutine frigate, with Captain James Macnamara, in which he narrowly escaped capture by the French squadron under M. Richery, off Cadiz, on 7 October 1795. After serving in the Pompée with Captain Vashon, and the Prince and Prince George, flagships of Sir Charles Cotton, he was promoted to be commander on 7 May 1802. For a short time in 1803 he was acting captain of the Braave frigate; in 1804 was appointed to the command of the Speedy brig, which formed part of the squadron employed off Boulogne and Calais during that and the succeeding year. In 1808 he was appointed to the Sarpen, for service in the Baltic and North Sea, and in February 1812 to the Sheldrake, from which, on 12 August, he was advanced to post-rank. He had no further service afloat, and, following his father's example, devoted himself from this time to religious studies and labours in the cause of unitarianism. After the death of his father (1813), he seems to have lived for some time at Swansea, where he wrote ‘Remonstrance of a Unitarian, addressed to [Burgess] the Bishop of St. Davids’ (8vo, 1818), which won him a high place in the esteem of his brother sectarians, and quickly ran into a second edition (1820). Replies to this remonstrance were entitled ‘Unitarianism indefensible. A letter … to … James Gifford [by J. Garbett],’ London, 1818, 8vo, and ‘An Examination of the Remonstrance addressed to the Bishop of St. David's, with Answers to the Questions addressed to Trinitarians generally,’ London, 1822, 8vo. Gifford afterwards moved with his sister and mother to Jersey, where he lived in a very modest way, devoting the greater part of his small income to works of benevolence, and to furthering the cause of unitarianism. In 1845 he published as a pamphlet ‘Letter of a Unitarian to the Rev. S. Langston, minister of St. James's Church, Jersey;’ but his principal work lay in the silent and unpretending but effective devotion to the cause with which he had associated himself. In 1846 he became a rear-admiral on the retired list, but the promotion made no change in his life, beyond increasing his income and his ability to give. He was not married, and died at Mont Orgueil Cottage, near St. Helier, on 20 August 1853. His mother had already died, at the age of 94, in 1840; his sister, Juliana Elizabeth, who had lived with him, survived him a few years, and died 19 April 1858, aged 84.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Gifford, James (1768-1853)\".

Nixon won the Granite State in a landslide, resulting in the withdrawal of McCloskey from the primaries (he promised to do so if he failed to reach >20% of the vote) and a clear path for the incumbent President to receive the Republican nomination.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Harlowe (died 1741) was a British Royal Navy captain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarlowe was on 19 March 1689–90 appointed to command the Smyrna Merchant, hired ship, and took post from that date. In the following year he commanded the Burford of 70 guns, in the grand fleet under Admiral Russell; and again in 1692, when he took part in the battle of Barfleur, being then in the division of Sir Ralph Delavall, vice-admiral of the red. In the Burford, in the Humber, and afterwards in the Torbay of 80 guns, he continued serving with the grand fleet during the war; and on 14 August 1697, while in command of a small squadron cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with and engaged a somewhat superior French squadron, under the command of M. de Pointis, homeward bound from the West Indies and laden with the spoils of Cartagena. The French were to windward, and after a three hours' contest, finding they gained no advantage, and probably unwilling to risk their very rich cargo, they hauled their wind and made sail. The English followed as they best could, but, being to leeward, were not able to prevent the enemy's retreat. After his return to England Harlowe was charged with having, by his misconduct of the action, permitted the French to escape. He was accordingly tried by court-martial on 29 November, and, after a very full investigation, was pronounced to be 'not guilty of the charge laid against him,' and was therefore acquitted. The court-martial is noticeable both for the dignity and the number of its members, Sir George Rooke, the admiral of the fleet, being president, and Shovell, Aylmer, Mitchell, and Benbow among its members, who numbered in all no less than sixty-one. It is noticeable also as being in the main an inquiry into tactical principles, the charge virtually amounting to an assertion that Harlowe might and should have cut through the enemy's line and so forced the fighting. He had not attempted to cut through it, and he was held to have done rightly by all the senior officers of the navy. Still more is it noticeable for the furious passions which raged over it, arising probably from anger that the rich prize should have escaped; even the finding of the court-martial did not still these; and for many months Harlowe would seem to have been subjected to a series of virulent attacks. Charnock is, however, wrong in saying that he had no further employment during the reign of King William. He was appointed to the Grafton on 14 February 1700–1. In 1702, still in the Grafton, he took part in the expedition to Cadiz, and was prominently engaged at Vigo in support of Vice-admiral Hopsonn. He returned to England with Sir Clowdisley Shovell [q. v.] in November, and the following April was appointed master-attendant at Deptford dockyard. In February 1704-5 he was appointed a commissioner of victualling, and continued in that office till November 1711. In May 1712 he was again appointed master-attendant of Deptford dockyard. The date of his retirement is unknown. He died 'at a very advanced age' in 1741, having been for several years the senior captain on the list.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Laughton, John Knox (1890). \"Harlowe, Thomas\".

Its only crewed flight was conducted in 1973 with Soyuz 13 of the Soyuz programme.\n\n\n== Design and flight ==\n\nThe one craft of the Soyuz 7K-T-AF was modified from the original Soyuz 7K-T with the addition of observatory and solar arrays. This was the second test flight of the redesigned Soyuz 7K-T, the second generation of the Soyuz spacecraft. The Soyuz 7K-T-AF flew once on Soyuz 13. The Soyuz 7K-T-AF was in the 7K-TM Configuration. Soyuz 7K-T-AF propulsion was from a KTDU-35, two liquid rocket engines. Soyuz 13/7K-T-AF was the first manned space observatory. Soyuz 7K-T-AF/Soyuz 13 housed the Orion 2 Space Observatory, operated by crew member Valentin Lebedev. Orion 2 Space Observatory was an Ultraviolet (UV) Telescope. The first Soviet UV Telescope was Orion 1 used on orbital station Salyut 1. The other crew member was Pyotr Klimuk.\nWith the Orion 2 astrophysical telescope and camera, the crew made observations of stars in the ultraviolet light range. Also added to Soyuz 7K-T-AF was experiment that photographed spectrozonal areas of the earth's surface. Soyuz 7K-T-AF landed in snowstorm 200 kilometres (120 mi) Southwest Karaganda. The observatory equipment was added to the top of  nose cone of the spacecraft. The observatory equipment was mounted were the docking port is mounted on the Soyuz 7K-OKS version.  Soyuz 22/Soyuz 7K-MF6 spacecraft would be the next 7K-T with observatory equipment mounted at the craft's docking port.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComparison of crewed space vehicles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRSC Energia: Concept Of Russian Manned Space Navigation Development\nMir Hardware Heritage\nDavid S.F.

        "content": "Cobalt(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Co(ClO4)2·nH2O (n = 0,6). The pink anhydrous and red hexahydrate forms are both hygroscopic solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nCobalt(II) perchlorate hexahydrate is produced by reacting cobalt metal or cobalt(II) carbonate with perchloric acid, followed by the evaporation of the solution:\n\nCoCO3 + 2 HClO4 → Co(ClO4)2 + H2O + CO2\nThe anhydrous form cannot be produced from the hexahydrate by heating, as it instead decomposes to cobalt(II,III) oxide at 170 °C. Instead, anhydrous cobalt(II) perchlorate is produced from the reaction of dichlorine hexoxide and cobalt(II) chloride, followed by heating in a vacuum at 75 °C.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe anhydrous form consists of octahedral Co(ClO4)6 centers, with tridentate perchlorate ligands. On the other hand, the orthorhombic hexahydrate consists of isolated [Co(H2O)6]2+ octahedrons and perchlorate anions with lattice constants a = 7.76 Å, b = 13.44 Å and c = 5.20 Å. The hexahydrate undergoes phase transitions at low temperatures.\n\n\n== References ==",

He served as mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, in 1851–52. \n\n\n== Life and career ==\nEvans was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to Septimus and Catharine (Haupt) Evans. He was the younger brother of Henry S. Evans, a Pennsylvania state representative and the owner-publisher of The Village Record in West Chester. He attended West Chester Academy under superintendent Anthony Bolmar from May 1834 to May 1836. After serving an apprenticeship with his brother's newspaper, Evans moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1844 to work as editor of the Delaware Republican newspaper.\nDuring the Mexican–American War, Evans served as a first lieutenant with the 11th United States Infantry Regiment, which saw extensive combat in the Battle for Mexico City. Evans commanded his company at the Battle of Chapultepec after Captain George W. Chaytor returned home on sick leave, and he distinguished himself in action at the Battle of Molino del Rey. On August 20, 1847, he received the brevet of captain \"for gallant and meritorious conduct in the battles of Contreras and Cherubusco.\" \nAfter the war ended, Evans and his company returned home via New York in August 1848, whereupon he resumed his editorial duties in Wilmington. On February 20, 1849, the Delaware General Assembly appropriated one hundred dollars to present him with a suitably inscribed ceremonial sword along with a letter from Governor William Tharp. Elected mayor of Wilmington as a Whig in 1851, Evans did not seek reelection in 1852.\nEvans died of tuberculosis in West Chester on February 19, 1854, at the age of 29. He was interred with military honors at Oaklands Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Belarusian economic miracle was a period of significant economic growth, urbanisation, and social change in Belarus during the late 20th century and early 21st century. Beginning under Kirill Mazurov, the Belarusian economy began a process of industrialisation which greatly accelerated under Pyotr Masherov. It continued until the 2007–2008 financial crisis, as Belarus endured the dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent economic problems within the region without wide-reaching privatisation. The economic model of Belarus during this time period has since been referred to the Belarusian model, and has since been attributed to the government of Alexander Lukashenko by Western analysts.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to World War II and the German occupation, Belarus had been an economic backwater that had largely avoided the industrialisation, urbanisation, and economic development occurring in the surrounding region at the time. By 1940, only 21.3% of the country's population lived in urban areas. The country lacked the agricultural strength of Ukraine to the south and the industrial capabilities of Ural. Following the Russian Revolution, the new Soviet government invested little effort into industrialising Belarus, perceiving it as vulnerable to invasion.The Belarusian population and economy suffered greatly from World War II and the subsequent German occupation. As much as one third to forty-five percent of the country's population was killed, and eighty percent of towns and villages in the country were destroyed, many of them deliberately as part of Generalplan Ost. Eighty percent of the capital, Minsk, was destroyed. Following the end of the war, Belarusian economic output was 20% of its pre-war level.Efforts to provide economic necessities to Belarus, such as food and agricultural machinery, began shortly after the liberation of Belarus in 1944. Belarus's economy was also boosted by economic migrants from the rest of the Soviet Union and the return of evacuated industry to Belarus. By 1950, Belarusian economic output was equal to that of pre-war levels.At the same time, Belarusian politics and economics became dominated by former members of the Belarusian partisans after most pre-war Belarusian leadership was killed in fighting. The heads of all six regions of Belarus were former partisan commanders, while the office of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia was held by ethnic Russians. The period between the liberation of Belarus and the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 was marked by dominance of both partisans from Eastern Belorussia and party cadres from other republics of the Soviet Union, particularly in Western Belarus, where among 1,175 party workers only 121 were Belarusians in 1953. This policy was reversed during the brief rule of Lavrentiy Beria, and continued after Beria's execution. These partisans would later oversee the Belarusian economic miracle.The early- to mid-1950s were marked by conflict between Nikolai Patolichev, First Secretary of the CPB, and Mikhail Zimyanin, former Second Secretary of the CPB. Zimyanin, a former partisan commander and Beria's choice for First Secretary of the CPB, argued for greater protections for collective farmers in Belarus, increase of wages, and improved housing, and accused Patolichev of paying insufficient attention to the conditions of rural Belarusians. With Beria's execution, however, Zimyanin's effort to replace Patolichev and reform the Belarusian economy ultimately ended in failure.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Mazurov period (before 1965) ===\nKirill Mazurov became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia in 1956. His tenure in power marked the beginning of the economic miracle, and coincided with the global Digital Revolution. In an effort to increase the Belarusian economy's diversity, Mazurov sought to expand the technological industry. He invested heavily into education, and as a result by 1961 Belarus had more schools and universities per population than more developed countries like the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Italy, and West Germany. Under Mazurov's rule, roughly 450 state-owned enterprises were created, primarily in the chemical, electronic, energy, and petroleum fields.Mazurov also focused on curbing alcoholism in Belarus, in connection with Nikita Khrushchev's Soviet-wide anti-alcohol campaign, which had itself been announced during a 22 January 1958 meeting in Minsk. More than 12,000 moonshine stills were destroyed throughout the republic, and almost 300,000 litres of moonshine were dumped during the campaign. 8,347 of the 38,178 arrests in the Byelorussian SSR during this period were on the basis of selling moonshine, ahead of those charged with hooliganism, murder, and theft.Among the most well-known companies established under Mazurov were automobile manufacturer BelAZ, potash producer Belaruskali, and the Mogilev Metallurgical Combine. The first oil and gas pipelines were also constructed in Belarus. However, according to historians L. Ju. Malychin, S. M. Vasovič, N. M. Kavaliova, and V. M. Kuzmič, Belarus's economic growth under Mazurov was hampered by the continued planned economy. Mazurov made efforts to resolve these issues with the liberalisation of the party (part of the broader process of De-Stalinisation in the Soviet Union), expansion of pensions, and reducing taxes on private farms in an effort to equalise them with collective farms.\n\n\n=== Masherov period and acceleration of growth (1965–1980) ===\nWhen Mazurov was promoted into the central Communist Party apparatus, he recommended Pyotr Masherov as his successor. A partisan leader like Mazurov, Masherov had previously been Deputy Head of the Council of Ministers, and the two had a shared interest in the republic's economic development. The new leader devoted himself to the strengthening of the Belarusian technological sector as his first task. During Masherov's rule, the Belarusian academia grew at a scale unmatched by other republics: more than ten thousand individuals acquired a Candidate of Sciences degree, a similar number acquired a Doctor of Science degree, and tens of thousands of academic works were submitted to the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. Belarus became one of the main exporting republics of the Soviet Union, with over one thousand different products across 100 countries, including both socialist and capitalist states.The development of Belarusian industry also further accelerated under Masherov: state-owned enterprises such as the Gomel Chemical Factory, Polymir, and Grodno Azot were established, as were high-tech industries such as television producer Haryzont, camera manufacturer BelOMO, and semiconductor manufacturer Integral, the latter eventually growing to become the largest company in the Eastern Bloc by the time of Masherov's 1980 death. Other developments included the Byaroza and Lukoml thermal power stations and the Minsk Metro.As a result of Masherov's economic efforts, from 1966 to 1970 alone the Byelorussian SSR's gross domestic product increased by more than half. Grain harvests under Masherov's rule increased from 2.3 million to 7 million tonnes, and Minsk was completely rebuilt. As a result of the economic advances under Masherov, Belarus was popularly known as the \"assembly shop of the Union\" among the Soviet public, a moniker which has been encouraged by subsequent Belarusian leaders.\n\n\n=== Post-Masherov period, independence, and Lukashenko's rule (1980–2008) ===\nMasherov's death resulted in an effective power vacuum in the republic, and his successor, Mikalay Slyonkow, was less fortunate in dealing with economic issues. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which dominated Belarusian politics in the 1980s, led to widespread political and economic instability. Instability was also present in the early post-independence period, leading to Alexander Lukashenko being elected as president in 1994.The relative prosperity of Belarus in comparison to other post-Soviet states has led to the belief in Western states that Lukashenko was responsible for the development of the Belarusian economic miracle. This belief is particularly predominant among members of the political left, who have positively compared to Belarus to Cuba as an example of a country avoiding capitalism. However, historian Andrew Wilson has rejected this claim, noting that following a 1992–1995 period of privatisation Lukashenko turned to an economic policy based on Russian economic subsidies and the loosening of export restrictions after the establishment of the Union State in 1999.Subsidies on Russian crude oil, coupled with high petroleum prices during the late 1990s and early 2000s and the usage of illicit methods of obtaining money by the Belarusian government, allowed Lukashenko to initially develop the left-wing economic model that has since become associated with his government. However, decreased Russian support after Lukashenko's 2006 re-election caused him to pursue a new policy of economic liberalisation in an effort to keep the economy afloat. The timing of these reforms coincided with the 2007–2009 Great Recession, which hit Belarus particularly hard. Russian exports were dramatically reduced, and the decreased price of Belarus's own exports resulted in an economic shortfall of between $6 and $7 million. As a result of the Great Recession, the Belarusian GDP decreased by 4.5% after previous GDP growth had carried it through the remainder of the previous year.Lukashenko's previous economic liberalisation, coupled with thawing relations with the European Union and United States, allowed him to obtain a series of loans from the International Monetary Fund. Additional measures were made, in violation of IMF loans, to improve the economy through direct state involvement. Still not enough, the government pursued a policy of massive borrowing from Russia, Azerbaijan, India, Venezuela, and particularly from China, which lent $5.7 billion to Belarus in December 2009. As a result of Lukashenko's economic policy during this period, the GDP rose by 0.2%, but at a cost: Belarusian debts numbered 52% of the country's GDP by 2010.The results of Lukashenko's economic liberalisation and the Great Recession resulted in the end of the Belarusian economic model. In its stead, Lukashenko later sought greater foreign investment and limited economic liberalisation.\n\n\n== Social change ==\n\nThe industrialisation of Belarus resulted in wide-reaching social changes. Politically, this led to the emergence of Minsk-based industrialists as the most powerful group in the country. The industrialists later fought a succession conflict with Masherov's partisan faction, ruling during the 1980s. The development of the Belarusian economic miracle has also been critical to Belarus's historical memory and the development of Eastern-based varieties of Belarusian nationalism. Efforts to disrupt the \"social contract\" between the Belarusian government and society by Western-based nationalists in the early 1990s contributed to Lukashenko's election in 1994.Perhaps most importantly, the Belarusian economic miracle resulted in the expansion of the Russian language and Russian culture in Belarus. The traditional agrarian Belarusian way of life was largely destroyed during the economic miracle, and many Belarusian-language schools were closed during the period. Both of these shifts have been attributed to Masherov, with Belarusian journalist Juryj Drakachrust, saying in 2018 that \"the era of the Belarusian village's disappearance is also the era of Masherov,\" and journalist Vital Cyhankoŭ describing Masherov as \"first place.\" Cyhankoŭ has also noted, however, that after Masherov, the number of Belarusian-language schools increased until Lukashenko's rule began.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The makeshift ferry Zico sank on April 7, 2024, between the Mozambique Channel and Mossuril Bay, off the coast of northern Mozambique. Over 100 of the 130 passengers on the overloaded vessel died. \n\n\n== Background ==\nMozambique and other neighboring African countries such as Zimbabwe and Malawi had uncontained cholera outbreaks in the months preceding the disaster. Since October 2023, the country has recorded about 15,000 cases of cholera and 32 deaths due to the disease.\nMany parts of the country are only accessible by boats, and the country has a poor road network and many parts are inaccessible by air. The disaster occurred despite recent pressure on ferry operators to improve safety. There is little oversight for the thousands of ferries operating in Mozambique and less deadly incidents are not uncommon.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe Mozambican vessel Zico, a fishing boat converted for use as a ferry, was traveling from Lunga in Mossuril District, Nampula Province to the Island of Mozambique on 7 April 2024. Most of the 130–150 passengers were trying to escape the mainland because of a cholera outbreak, with Nampula being one of the worst-affected provinces. Others were travelling to attend a fair on the island. Surviving crewmember Menque Amade said that he requested that the crew chief increase the boat's speed once he saw that the boat was adrift. \nA survivor claimed that the vessel was overcrowded and began to take on water because of the number of people leading to passengers panicking and jumping off the vessel into the sea. The vessel sank off the coast of northern Mozambique between the Mozambique Channel and Mossuril Bay and was later dragged to shore.\nOver 100 people were killed, including many children. There were 12 survivors, according to provincial officials and as of 9 April 2024, around 20 people were still missing.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBodies washed up on the beach, and some were quickly buried in line with Islamic rites.\nAuthorities initially blamed the sinking on overcrowding but later said the boat sank after taking on water. Early reports also suggested that the boat had been struck by a tidal wave. Nampula province's Secretary of State Jaime Neto said that misinformation about cholera caused people to panic and board the boat. A Maritime Transport Institute official indicated that the boat was not licensed to transport passengers. President Filipe Nyusi ordered an investigation headed by the transport minister, Mateus Magala. A period of national mourning was observed from 10 to 12 April.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFootage of the disaster",

        "content": "The Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family is a 1999 non-fiction book by historian Sterling Seagrave and Peggy Seagrave. The full text is divided into 13 chapters in total. The book is a biography of the Imperial Family of Japan since the Meiji Restoration stretching across five generations: Emperor Kōmei, Emperor Meiji, Emperor Taishō, Emperor Shōwa, and Emperor Heisei.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe book begins with the Tokugawa Shogunate and Emperor Kōmei's reactions to the internal turmoil created by the Perry Expedition which forced Japan to revise its isolationist policies and open up diplomatic and trade relations with the West. Throughout is included a general overview of Japan's feudal system, the various clans which ruled over it, and their relationships with the outside world at the time.\nThe 1866 Satsuma-Chōshū Alliance resulted in the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the glorification of the Emperor of Japan. This glorification, however, necessitated the need to carefully manage every aspect of the imperial family's life and appearances. Emperor Kōmei's death meant that rule was inherited by Emperor Meiji, who at the time was only 15 years old and influenced by and reliant on his court advisors. Focus is put on those who were exerting influence over the Emperor's upbringing, lifestyle, or advising his decisions, as well as members of the Imperial family.\nWhen Emperor Meiji died, he was succeeded by Emperor Taishō, whose disabilities and eccentricities led to further sequestering of the Imperial family. As his condition deteriorated, the ability of the genrō, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and Imperial Household Minister to manipulate imperial decisions came to become a matter of common knowledge.\nSucceeding Taishō was Emperor Hirohito, known formally by his Japanese era name as Emperor Shōwa, who reigned over the longest era in Japanese history starting in 1926 until his death in 1989. Much of the book details the life experiences and upbringings of Hirohito and his family and examines their role in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Operation Golden Lily, and World War II as well as their collaboration with the American government during the occupation of Japan in order to avoid being held responsible for the war.\nThe book ends by briefly examining Emperor Heisei's life and rise to the throne, who by the time of the book's release had only been coronated the year before.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nForeign Affairs reviewer Richard N. Cooper said \"this sensational book really focuses on World War II, especially Emperor Hirohito's complicity in Japanese war plans\" and that it was \"a good read, but it drags in old rumors... without offering any new evidence or fresh Japanese sources.\" He rejected the authors' argument about Operation Golden Lily that \"extensive loot, mainly gold and gemstones, laid the basis for Japan's remarkable postwar economic recovery.\"\nThe New York Times reviewed it as \"a book that presents a darkly cartoonish view of modern Japan [that] contains elements of truth.\" It said that the \"key sources are weak, or missing altogether\" about the book's claims made about Operation Golden Lily and that \"big conspiracy theories require big proof, and the Seagraves fail to provide it.\"\nSouth China Morning Post reviewed it as \"contain[ing] all the elements of a political thriller: family squabbles, power struggles, duplicity and murder,\" and said that it was an \"an incisive biography of five generations of Japan's imperial family since the Meiji Restoration in 1868.\"\nPublisher's Weekly reviewed the book saying it \"dramatically brings the imperial family--and those behind it--to life, offering readers an intriguing glimpse behind the long-maintained veil of secrecy.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Yamato Dynasty at Internet Archive\nSterling Seagrave Official Site",

        "content": "Wembley Fraggle is a fictional puppet character who appears in Jim Henson's television series Fraggle Rock, as well as its reboot Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock. In the original series, he is performed by Steve Whitmire. In Back to the Rock, he is performed by Jordan Lockhart. Bob Bergen voiced him in the animated series. \nIn both the original series and its reboot, Wembley is one of the five main characters, and the best friend of the show's protagonist Gobo Fraggle. Wembley is cheerful, indecisive, and insecure. He has a tendency to get overexcited in certain situations. Wembley is always seen wearing a t-shirt with a banana tree motif on it. He works as the siren for the Fraggle Rock Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n== Development ==\nWembley, along with the other Fraggles, was first conceived and developed by series creator Jim Henson. The Wembley puppet was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Rollie Krewson. Wembley's name was derived from Wembley Stadium in London. In-universe, his first name has the meaning of \"one who is indecisive\", suiting Wembley well. When building Wembley, Rollie Krewson used a ping-pong ball for the distinctive shape of his nose; the ball has a hole in it where the puppeteer's finger can be inserted to move the mouth. Krewson also rebuilt Wembley for Back to the Rock. During the audition process for Fraggle Rock, fellow Muppeteer Jerry Nelson (later to play Gobo) performed Wembley.\n\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nWembley is a rod puppet, meaning that his arms are controlled by rods attached to the puppet's hands. Wembley's puppet has the unique ability among Fraggles to roll his eyes, often used in scenes to show that he is growing nervous or excited. This is achieved by swapping out the regular head of the puppet for one with a radio-controlled mechanism inside.Steve Whitmire performed Wembley on the original series. Following Whitmire's departure from the Muppets in 2016, John Tartaglia physically performed Wembley for the short-form TV series Fraggle Rock: Rock On! for Apple TV+ in 2020, with Frankie Cordero dubbing the voice. For 2022's Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, Jordan Lockhart assumed the role.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nWembley appears as one of the five main characters in the original Fraggle Rock series and Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, as well as the short series Fraggle Rock: Rock On! He also appears in Fraggle Rock: The Animated Series, voiced there by Bob Bergen. Along with the other Fraggles, he appeared (performed by Steve Whitmire) in the 1987 TV special A Muppet Family Christmas. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 King and Queen of the Ring is an upcoming professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE. It will be the 12th King of the Ring event and will take place on Saturday, May 25, 2024, at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It will air via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming and feature wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event will host the finals of both the 23rd King of the Ring tournament and the second Queen's Crown tournament, with the last tournaments for each held in 2021.\nThis will be the 11th event that WWE will hold in Saudi Arabia under a 10-year partnership in support of Saudi Vision 2030, thus marking the first King of the Ring event held outside of the United States. Although the event was originally scheduled to be held at the same location in May 2023, plans were changed and WWE replaced the event with Night of Champions. This will be the first King of the Ring event since 2015, which was livestreamed exclusively on the WWE Network, the first to livestream on Peacock in the United States, the first to air on traditional PPV since 2002, and the first dedicated event for the Queen's Crown tournament, which was established in 2021.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn early 2018, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE began a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program. In March 2023, WWE scheduled a Saudi Arabian event titled King and Queen of the Ring for the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, which would have revived the King of the Ring event series but with a rebranding, but on April 13, it was revealed that these plans were scrapped with the event replaced by Night of Champions. Fightful later reported that WWE did not have plans to reschedule King and Queen of the Ring for later that year, but that the event could possibly be used for a future Saudi Arabian show.\nOn April 7, 2024, during night two of WrestleMania XL, WWE announced plans to go ahead with the King and Queen of the Ring event in Saudi Arabia at the Jeddah Super Dome, thus marking the 12th King of the Ring and 11th overall event in the Saudi Arabian partnership. It is scheduled to be held on May 25, 2024. This marks the first King of the Ring event since 2015, which was livestreamed exclusively on the WWE Network, the first to livestream on Peacock in the United States, the first to air on traditional PPV since 2002, and the first King of the Ring event held outside of the United States. It was also confirmed that the May 24 episode of Friday Night SmackDown would take place in Saudi Arabia for the first time.\nThe King of the Ring event was originally based around the King of the Ring tournament, a men's single-elimination tournament that was established by WWE in 1985 with the winner being crowned \"King of the Ring\". It was held annually until 1991, with the exception of 1990. These early tournaments were special non-televised house shows. In 1993, the promotion began to produce the King of the Ring tournament as a self-titled PPV. It continued as the annual June PPV until the 2002 event, which was the final King of the Ring produced as a PPV. Following the conclusion of the PPV chronology, the tournament began to be held periodically every few years at other PPVs or on WWE's weekly television programs. WWE then revived the event in 2015, but it was again discontinued with the tournament again being periodically held on WWE's weekly television programs or other PPVs. With the event's revival and rebranding as King and Queen of the Ring in 2024, it will see the finals of the 23rd King of the Ring tournament and the second Queen's Crown tournament, which had been established as the female counterpart in 2021 with the winner crowned \"Queen\", thus being the first dedicated event for the Queen's Crown.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event will include matches that result from scripted storylines. Results are predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines are produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

For 17 years she worked as a civil servant as Murmansk regional duma.\nShe wrote a nonfiction book \"Неизвестная северная история О трагических судьбах кольских финнов и норвежцев, подвергшихся политическим репрессиям\" (Unknown Northern History. About the tragic fates of the Kola Finns and Norwegians who were subjected to political repression) about the persecution of 210 Murmansk Finns and Kola Norwegians (printed in Finnish as Kuka koputtaa ovellesi?, Who is Knocking at Your Door?, translated by  Pekka Iivari, in 2023). \nThe 2020 Russian print of the book was confiscated by the Federal Security Service right from the printing house and Haikara was accused of \"incitement of ethnic hatred\". Her advocate insisted that the experts on whose opinion accusation was based were lacking competence, and the second expertise performed in 2022 refuted their findings. According to Russian political scientist Aleksandr Kynev, Haikara's case follows the trend in Putin's Russia to suppress information about persecutions under Stalin.\nHaikara traveled to Finland in August 2020 for research purposes before the FSS raided her publisher. She was informed of the raid in December of that same year. FSS denied the seizure of the books, and because Haikara had a contract to deliver 25 copies to the Ministry of Culture of the Murmansk region, the ministry accused her of the breach of contract. Fearing prosecution, she did not return to Russia and continued to work on her book while staying in Lahti. As of 2024 she lives in Rovaniemi and doing her Ph.D. as a junior researcher at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Lapland. \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The villa now houses the Museum of Contemporary Art and of the Twentieth Century of Monsummano Terme.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Villa was designed in 1887 by Cesare Spighi in an eclectic style, mixing classical design with some more flowing elements, such as stairwells and lamps that suggest what later became Liberty style. The villa once belonged to the journalist, writer, and publisher Ferdinando Martini (1841-1928). Martini had originally decorated the villa with paintings by Giovanni Fattori, Francesco and Luigi Gioli, Eugenio Cecconi, Niccolò Cannicci, and Angelo Torchi. These were sold after Martini's death.\nUltimately is was purchased by the city, and open since 1988 as a cultural center. By the year 2000, it became a museum hosting art mainly from the 20th century (the Renatico Civic Collection). The collection includes works by Pietro Annigoni, Vinicio Berti, Ferdinando Chevrier, Lamberto Pignotti, Eugenio Miccini, and Ketty La Rocca as well as by contemporary artists from the 21st century. The city and museum sponsor an International Engraving Prize since 1999.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Truth Comes Limping is a 1938 mystery detective novel by the British author Alfred Walter Stewart, published under his pseudonym J.J. Connington.   It is the twelfth in a series of seventeen novels featuring the Golden Age Detective  Sir Clinton Driffield, the Chief Constable of a rural English county. It was published by Hodder and Stoughton in London and Little, Brown and Company in the United States.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn the village of Abbots Norton not far from the county town of Ambledown a corpse is discovered on a lovers lane one dark night by a courting couple. A poacher is discovered behaving suspiciously around the area, but clues seem to suggest a connection with the wealthy landowners who control the country estate next to where the murder took place. The dead man proves to be a hack writer who after years of struggle has seemed to hit on a financial bonanza by writing a biography of a recently deceased novelist and scoundrel, which he appears to have used as the basis for blackmailing those implicated in the famous man's diaries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCarter, Ian.

        "content": "Pietro Fea (7 August 1771 – 15 April 1842) was an Italian painter.\nHe was born in Casale Monferrato to a town merchant; but orphaned at a young age, he apprenticed with  Giovanni Galliari, who was active in painting at the Teatro Regio di Torino. He then became a pupil of Laurent Pêcheux in Turin. In 1805, he built an ephemeral celebration float for the visit of Napoleon to Turin. He gained patronage of the Savoy Court, including painting for the Royal Govone Castle and now-lost frescoes for the ball-room of the Royal Palace of Turin. In 1825, he decorated some rooms of the Palazzo Doria-Tursi in Genoa. He painted frescoes for the Palazzo del Pozzo in Moncalvo. In 1829, he painted frescoes for the church of San Lorenzo in Turin. That year, he was named professor of perspective for the Accademia Albertina. On of his pupils was Carlo Piacenza. He died in Casalborgone. \n\n\n== Note ==",

        "content": "Ailín Luciana Pérez  (born Octobre 5, 1994) is an Argentine professional mixed martial artist who currently competes in the Bantamweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).\n\n\n== Background ==\nAilín started in martial arts at the age of 11 in Zárate, with kung fu and sanda, and at the age of 20 she decided to move to Buenos Aires and do some Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ), to get more into MMA. Finally, she turned professional in 2018.\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts career ==\n\n\n=== Early carrer ===\nAilín won the women's bantamweight title of the Brazilian company Samurai Fight House in August 2021 by defeating Alessandra Tainara with a head kick. But he lost it in November 2021 against Tamires Vidal, to whom he applied an illegal knee.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===\nAilín debuted in the UFC on September 3, 2022. It was scheduled for her to face Zarah Fairn Dos Santos at UFC Fight Night: Gane vs. Tuivasa. However, Fairn was withdrawn from the event for unknown reasons and replaced by Stephanie Egger. Ailín lost the fight by rear-naked choke submission in the second round.\nAilín faced Ashlee Evans-Smith on July 15, 2023, at UFC Fight Night 224. She won the fight by unanimous decision.\nAilín faced Lucie Pudilová on November 18, 2023, at UFC Fight Night 232. She won the fight by unanimous decision.\nAilín is scheduled to face Joselyne Edwards on June 1, 2024, at UFC 302.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Altercation with Joselyne Edwards ===\nBefore UFC Fight Night 232, Ailín Pérez appeared with some stitches under her left eye. He refused to talk about it and said he would do so until after the fight. \n\n\"This is an aggression I had at the PI on Tuesday. It was a random person, who I will name later. They came to attack me so the fight wouldn't happen. And I'm sorry, my friend, the fight did happen,\" said Ailín.\nAilín pointed out that thanks to her coach she had been able to stay on the card. Since, according to Pérez's version, it was her coach who separated the altercation and removed the aggressor from on top of her.\nAilín avoided openly saying the name of the aggressor, nor did she confirm that it was Joselyne Edwards when asked directly. However, in an Instagram story, she shared a clip of her statements, accompanied by a Dominican flag and the phrase \"for you.\"\nOn her part, Joselyne Edwards spoke with MMAMania.com to give her version of what happened.\n\n“While we were fighting, his coach attacked me from behind. He was strangling me so that Ailín could hit me. His coach attacked me. I practically had to fight with both of them. He didn't protect anyone, he started the fight. He was the one who stirred things up for the fight to happen. And then he attacked me and was strangling me. Later, when I had already been separated from Ailín, he kept strangling me and wouldn't let go. He didn't break up the fight, he attacked me while she was attacking me.”\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nSamurai Fight House\nSamurai Fight House Bantamweight Champion (Two time)\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAilin Perez at UFC\nProfessional MMA record for Ailin Perez from Sherdog",

        "content": "Ionel Rotaru (1918-1982) was a Romani activist.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIonel Rotaru was born in Bessarabia, now located in modern-day Moldova, in 1918. He had a middle-class upbringing living with his parents, three brothers, and two sisters. His family was literate; his father was an engineer, while two of his brothers held jobs as an architect and a journalist.\nDuring World War Two, he was a conscript in the Romanian Army before fleeing west in 1946 as the only surviving member of his family, the rest of them executed by the Nazis. He escaped to Italy, then Egypt, before settling in France in 1947. It is unclear whether he entered the country illegally. Before reaching Paris, he struggled to maintain a job, bouncing between various occupations and cities. He worked as a sailor in Marseille, a miner in Lens, and once in Paris, he was a porter in the Les Halles market for an unspecified period. At some point, he got married to his wife and moved into a one-bedroom apartment on 75 Rue Victor Hugo. During his time in France, he experienced moderate amounts of success in his artistic career, which continued even as he advocated for the Romani people.\n\n\n== Romani activism ==\n\n\n=== Supreme Leader of the Gypsies ===\nIn May 1959, several French newspapers reported sensational news that the Roma had crowned their supreme leader with the exotic title of Vaida Voevod III in Enghien-les-Bains, a small town north of Paris. Ionel Rotaru, now self-proclaimed as Vaida Voevod III, staged this coronation, with engaging photographs distributed to the press. These images depicted Rotaru and the former Voevod participating in a symbolic transfer of title, mingling their blood from their wrists. The Declaration of the Rights of Man played a significant role in the event, as well as symbolism associated with the colors blue (for the sky) and green (for hope) on his sash. The theatrical nature of the ceremony intrigued Romani intellectuals in Paris who considered themselves ‘the real Bohemians’.\nRotaru already had a support base among the Roma immigrants in Paris from Romania and other countries before this event. He had initially assisted the immigrants with issues of immigration, and was becoming increasingly involved in helping individuals with reparation claims against West Germany. The Romani intellectuals of Paris joined forces with him in support of this cause. Rotaru received significant assistance from two half-brothers, Jacques and Louis Dauvergne, who had mixed French and Rudari Roma backgrounds and adopted the political names Vanko and Léulea Rouda. Vanko, a paralegal, was granted substantial time by his law firm to work on Roma cases pro bono. Together, they established two organizations: the Organisation Nationale Gitane and the Communauté Mondiale Gitane (CMG).\n\n\n=== Communauté Mondiale Gitane ===\nThroughout his activism, Ionel Rotaru created various associations with the intent of supporting the Romani people. The Communauté Mondiale Gitane (CMG), also known as the World Community of Gypsies in English, is the most notable and successful –and the first international Romani organization. Despite not formally reigning as a king, Rotaru established a transnational network through CMG to advocate for Romani rights. This network extended beyond the Iron Curtain to Poland, where the first office was established. Rotaru also reached out to other countries in the West to form more offices, including the UK, Ireland, Canada, Germany, and Austria. In these countries, he sought to address the concerns of various marginalized groups stigmatized by their nomadic lifestyles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Andy's Frozen Custard 300 was the 8th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 20th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, April 13, 2024, at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, a 1.5 miles (2.4 km) permanent asphalt quad-oval shaped intermediate speedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete. In one of the closest finishes in Xfinity Series history, Sam Mayer, driving for JR Motorsports, would make a last-lap pass for the lead on Ryan Sieg, and held him off in a wild photo finish to earn his fifth career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his first of the season. The margin of victory was 0.002 seconds, tying it for the second closest finish in Xfinity Series history, alongside Milwaukee 1996 and Talladega 1999. Sieg led 17 of the final 18 laps in the race, before being passed by Mayer on the final lap. Justin Allgaier was most consistent driver of the race, winning both stages and leading a race-high 117 laps, but ultimately fell back and rounded out the podium by finishing 3rd.\nThis was also the second race of the Dash 4 Cash. Drivers who were eligible for the Dash 4 Cash are Sam Mayer, Chandler Smith, Justin Allgaier, and Sheldon Creed, since they were the highest finishing Xfinity Series regulars following the race at Martinsville. Mayer would claim the $100K bonus cash after narrowly winning the race.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nTexas Motor Speedway is a speedway located in the northernmost portion of the U.S. city of Fort Worth, Texas – the portion located in Denton County, Texas. The track measures 1.5 miles (2.4 km) around and is banked 24 degrees in the turns, and is of the oval design, where the front straightaway juts outward slightly. The track layout is similar to Atlanta Motor Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway (formerly Lowe's Motor Speedway). The track is owned by Speedway Motorsports, Inc., the same company that owns Atlanta and Charlotte Motor Speedway, as well as the short-track Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice session was held on Friday, April 12, at 5:00 PM CST, and would last for 20 minutes. Justin Allgaier, driving for JR Motorsports, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 29.902, and a speed of 180.590 mph (290.631 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Friday, April 12, at 5:30 PM CST. Since Texas Motor Speedway is an intermediate speedway, the qualifying system used is a single-car, one-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have one lap to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nJesse Love, driving for Richard Childress Racing, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 29.093, and a speed of 185.612 mph (298.714 km/h).\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\n\n\n=== Final laps ===\nThe race restarted on lap 190 after an incident involving Sheldon Creed, Kyle Weatherman, and Hailie Deegan. Riley Herbst blew a tire after contact with Brandon Jones on lap 191, but did not produce a caution. Ryan Sieg took over the lead on the restart, and continued to pull away by about one second. Sieg's car began getting tight, allowing Sam Mayer to close the gap. On the final lap, Mayer made a move to the inside of Sieg for the lead. Coming into turn 3, Mayer drifted up the racetrack and allowed Sieg to his inside. The two drivers banged doors all the way to the start/finish line, with Mayer beating out Sieg by 0.002 seconds, tied with '96 Milwaukee and '99 Talladega as the 2nd closest finish in Xfinity Series history. Justin Allgaier, after leading 117 laps, finished in third, with A. J. Allmendinger and Cole Custer rounding out the top five. Austin Hill, Ryan Truex, Sammy Smith, Jesse Love, and Anthony Alfredo would complete the rest of the top ten.\nStage 1 Laps: 65\n\nStage 2 Laps: 65\n\nStage 3 Laps: 70\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Maravedi or coinage is an ancient tax levied in various peninsular kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre. In Castile, it was known as the foral coinage. The purpose of this tax was to prevent the king from minting more currency, thereby depreciating the circulating value of the current coins.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Middle Ages, \"the currency belongs to the prince and is held as another patrimonial asset of the crown.\" This prerogative was protected by the doctrine of jurists of the time until it was questioned by Nicolas Oresme, Rector of the College of Navarre in Paris and bishop of Lisieux who claimed that \"the currency belongs, by reason of its ends, to the community.\"\nFor the historian Juan Carrasco Pérez, the first mention \"of the coinage corresponds to the County of Catalonia, contained in a document of Ramón Berenguer III and dated in 1118.\" In this context, he claims, \"it could be imagined that similar policies would be followed, with all the variables one wants, in the kingdom of Aragon and, of course, in the kingdom of Pamplona under its dynastic union (1076-1134), whose sovereigns promoted the expansion of urban life, the increase in commercial activity and, therefore, of the monetary economy.\"\nThe coinage was introduced by Pedro II around the year 1205 to the displeasure of the kingdom both as a new tax and for the burden it caused since it was satisfied at the rate of twelve dinars per pound, although it was later reduced. In the time of Juan I, it was fixed at an amount that did not exceed one maravedí, estimated at seven sueldos, which was paid every seven years by those who owned real estate or movable goods valued at more than 70 sueldos.\nNor was much obtained from this income both because the places of the military orders only paid half and nothing was paid by the lordships, as well as the exemptions enjoyed by some cities and towns and having redeemed others from this contribution and having alienated the Kings' right to collect it in favor of some churches and lords.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCarrasco Pérez, Juan (2011). \"The coinage tax in the kingdom of Navarre (ca. 1243-1355): taxation, demography, monetary history\".

        "content": "The United States Hotel was a hotel in Portland, Maine. At the time of its closure, in 1900, it was one of the oldest hotels in the city, having been in business for 97 years. The hotel stood on Federal Street (now Monument Way), behind Market House (built in 1825; later modified to become Portland's original city hall), in what was then known as Haymarket Square. Built in 1803 as the Washington Hall Hotel, it was later renamed the Cumberland Hotel. It was renamed again, around 1829, to the Portland House, then the Cumberland House in 1835.At the time of its opening, the hotel had eighteen parlors and 57 bedrooms. It had 150 rooms at its peak, and was listed as one of three principal hotels in Maine in The United States Statistical Directory, Or, Merchants' and Travellers' Guide (1847), the others being the American House (at the corner of Fore Street and Lime Street) and Casco Temperance House (on Middle Street). Elm Tavern (also on Federal Street) and Cape Cottage (on Cape Elizabeth) joined the ranks in 1850.Two United States presidents stayed at the hotel: James K. Polk (then in-office) in 1846 and Millard Fillmore in 1855. Bill Hickock was also a guest.The hotel underwent extensive remodeling in 1875, including the addition of a fifth floor, telegraph services for its guests, a reading room, a billiard room and supplementary bathrooms. In 1880, a livery stable was advertised as being connected to the hotel.In 1891, by which time Haymarket Square had been renamed Monument Square, the ground floor of the hotel was occupied by M. T. Quimby & Co. jewelers.The hotel's proprietors included Foss and O'Connor, R. W. Carter, George F. Wolcott, and Will H. McDonald.The hotel closed in 1900, and the building became Edwards and Walker hardware store, prior to the building's demolition in December 1965. The new construction, completed in 1969, was originally the home of Casco Bank. It is the home of One Monument Square today. A plaque in front of the current building denotes the site as the former location of the hotel.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2006-10-29 21:55:42",
        "content": "Zapomniana melodia (Forgotten melody) is a Polish musical comedy from 1938 directed by Konrad Tom and Jan Fethke, featuring three well-known songs by Ludwik Starski with music by Henryk Wars: Ach, jak przyjemnie! and Już nie zapomnisz mnie, along with an elaborate arrangement of the song Frère Jacques. The film's protagonists are the lovers, boarding school student Helenka Roliczówna (Helena Grossówna) and Stefan Frankiewicz (Aleksander Żabczyński). The young man sings the titular \"forgotten melody\" (Już nie zapomnisz mnie), but when a series of misunderstandings arise between the couple, their feelings fade and they forget the lyrics of the song. However, they happily come to an understanding, Stefan remembers the song's lyrics, and the lovers live happily ever after. Helenka's father, Bogusław Rolicz (Antoni Fertner) – the president of a cosmetics company – uses the \"forgotten melody\" to remember the recipe for his invention and protect it from theft by a competitor in the industry, Roxy.\nZapomniana melodia was a box office success, and its accompanying songs became hits. Interwar critics had mixed opinions about the film; while most viewed the production positively, there were also very negative reviews in the trade press. In later years, film scholars and historians praised the production. Jerzy Toeplitz wrote that it was \"the only successful cultural musical comedy in the entire pre-war Polish film industry (...) \", which \"had a well-constructed plot, humor, and charm\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nHelenka Roliczówna, the daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur in the cosmetics industry, is a boarder at the Institute for the Education of Girls near Warsaw. Along with her friend, Jadzia Pietrusińska, they lead the class in pranks on their conservative singing teacher, Professor Frankiewicz, who forces them to practice singing the song Frère Jacques until they drop. A series of misunderstandings unfold when Stefan Frankiewicz, the professor's nephew, arrives by motorboat from Warsaw. He engages in a conversation with Helenka on the river after colliding with her kayak while she was paddling back to the dock after physical education class. During the next music class, the girls once again play a prank on their teacher by directing a love letter to him. After reading the message about the urgent need for a meeting, the irritated professor throws the note out the window directly into Stefan's hands, who was waiting at the school gate. Seeing Helenka's figure in the window, frightened by the incident, Stefan assumes the letter is addressed to him. During the break, Roliczówna and Pietrusińska unsuccessfully try to talk to Stefan and resolve the misunderstanding but are chased away by Frankiewicz. He recognizes his nephew and scares him off from the school gate, fearing a repetition of his past antics.\nAt the same time, Bogusław Rolicz, in the final stages of preparing to present his latest incredible achievement to the supervisory board – chocolate-flavored soap that bounces like a ball after being wetted – fears that his competitor, Mr. Roxy, will steal the recipe and take all the profits. At the urging of his secretary, he decides to memorize the formula because no one can steal it from his mind. As the president of the board of trustees of the institute, he visits the school and observes his daughter's progress. In the evening, Helenka meets Stefan at the dock, according to the information conveyed in the letter, to clarify the misunderstanding. During a playful argument, the man falls into the water, pretending to drown. The frightened boarding students rush to his rescue and carry him to the institute. Professor Frankiewicz expresses outrage at the repeated encounter with his nephew, insisting that he deny any relationship and leave the school as soon as possible. The situation takes an unexpected turn. To avoid embarrassing his relative, Stefan tells everyone that his name is Stefan Roxy (he read the name on a bottle of cologne). Soon after, the school principal proudly announces the courage of the students to President Rolicz. In light of this event, the industrialist intends to fund a winter swimming pool for the school. The school principal reveals the joyful news to the music teacher, then scolds him upon learning that he expelled the boy from school. Professor Frankiewicz encourages Stefan to return. A deeper love develops between Helenka and Stefan.\nPresident Rolicz struggles to memorize the recipe, but his prolonged efforts yield no results. At one point, Helenka plays the song Stefan sang for her, prompting the industrialist to come up with the formula words set to a catchy melody and begin making progress in memorization. Meanwhile, dancer Lili Fontelli, whom Stefan showered with expensive gifts and confessed his love to, begins searching for her beloved at the institute. Giving only his name to the coachman, she arouses suspicion among the educators that Professor Frankiewicz is the admirer of the nightclub star. In the evening, the music teacher goes to the Imperial club where the dancer performs to clarify the situation. At the same club, Helenka, accidentally taking Stefan's coat, has a discreet meeting with him, while unaware, her father goes there for a meeting with his partners.\nProfessor Frankiewicz explains the recent mistake to Lili Fontelli, then, unaccustomed to alcohol, at her urging, he drinks a cocktail, which suddenly worsens his health. Shortly afterward, the dancer notices Stefan and warmly greets him. After their date, Helenka realizes she left her coat behind and returns to the Imperial to retrieve it. Mistakenly interpreting Stefan and Lili's affection as genuine, she rejects the boy's love. President Rolicz witnesses the inappropriate behavior of the professor and is shocked by his daughter's presence with a stranger at the dance hall, and to top it off, his secretary convinces him that Stefan is the son of a competitor in the industry. The angry president expels Helenka from the institute and renounces his patronage of the institution. Professor Frankiewicz resigns from his position as a teacher. Despite further misunderstandings, Zapomniana melodia ultimately leads to a happy ending. During a board meeting, Rolicz forgets the memorized formula, and an anxious Helenka fails to remember Stefan's song, so she must – not without joy – restore him to favor. Stefan sings the \"forgotten melody\", the president remembers the formula, and happily accepts his daughter's love for her former enemy. Learning about the dismissal of the music teacher, the boarding students take successful action to save his position at the school. In the final scene, all the characters paddle kayaks, singing Ach, jak przyjemnie! joyfully.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nThe information provided is a cast list for the film Zapomniana melodia:\n\nHelena Grossówna as Helenka Rolicz, daughter of President Rolicz\nAleksander Żabczyński as Stefan Frankiewicz\nAntoni Fertner as President Bogusław Rolicz, Helenka's father\nMichał Znicz as Professor Frankiewicz, Stefan's uncle\nJadwiga Andrzejewska as Jadzia Pietrusińska\nStanisław Sielański as Secretary Jarząbek\nJózef Orwid as Marcin, the coachman\nWładysław Grabowski as a partner in Rolicz's company\nJerzy Roland as Alfred\nAlina Żeliska as Lili Fontelli\nRenata Radojewska as Rena\nTeodozja Bohdańska as the headmistress\nRoman Dereń as a partner in Rolicz's company (not credited)\nJanina Krzymuska as the cooking teacher (not credited)\nWincenty Łoskot as Jan, Rolicz's butler (not credited)\nZygmunt Regro-Regirer as the waiter at the \"Imperial\" restaurant and dance hall (not credited)\nMieczysław Winkler as the receptionist at the Continental hotel (not credited)\nWacław Zdanowicz as the bartender at the Imperial restaurant and dance hall (not credited)\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn the first half of 1938, a group of filmmakers and producers established a private limited company called Omnia-Film to produce the musical comedy Zapomniana melodia. The first information about starting the creation of this new film project appeared in the May issues of Wiadomości Filmowe, followed by further news in the weekly magazine Kino and the monthly magazine Srebrny Ekran. The directors of the production were Konrad Tom and Jan Fethke, with the screenplay by Napoleon Sądek, Jan  Fethke, and Ludwik Starski. The music was prepared by Henryk Wars, while the lyrics of the songs – Ach, jak przyjemnie! and Już nie zapomnisz mnie – as well as the modern arrangement signed as Panie Janie (w stylu jazz) were composed by Ludwik Starski.\nThe main female role was played by Helena Grossówna, while the main male character was portrayed by Aleksander Żabczyński. The rest of the cast included Antoni Fertner, Michał Znicz, Stanisław Sielański, Józef Orwid, Władysław Drabowski, Teodozja Bohdańska, Jadwiga Andrzejewska, Alina Żeliska, and Renata Radojewska. In the role of boarders, besides Grossówna, Andrzejewska, and Radojewska, background actors, who were students at Tacjanna Wysocka's dance school (advertised in the press as \"the most beautiful Warsaw women\"), also appeared.\nThe filming took place at the Falanga studio on Trębacka Street in Warsaw, with outdoor takes filmed in Zegrzynek near Warsaw, and other smaller scenes shot on the streets of Warsaw, such as Traugutta Street. The filming was completed in early November.\nThe premiere of Zapomniana melodia took place on 25 November 1938, at the Pan cinema in Warsaw. The film was a box office success. The audience flocked to cinemas, and Ach, jak przyjemnie! and Już nie zapomnisz mnie became hit songs. Helena Grossówna accepted the film studio's proposal to attend every premiere of the film in major cities across Poland.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\nStefania Heymanowa, associated with the weekly magazine Bluszcz, did not share the enthusiasm of the audience. She believed that Zapomniana melodia repeated all the imperfections of Polish comedy: the lack of reflection of Polish realities of the setting and the presented environment, the senselessness of the script, the lack of plot logic, the blind imitation of American life and customs, the lack of in-depth character development (the boarders resemble more of a group of girls; they lack individual traits). In the summary of her review, she wrote: In total, \"Zapomniana melodia\" is at most a farce, with a few pleasant songs, and one should not be deluded that it is a model for Polish musical comedy. Anna Zahorska from Kultura appreciated the fairly cohesive script, the wit of some scenes, and the actors' performances (with the exception of Żabczyński, who apart from his looks, did not impress with much else, moving as if indifferent). In a further opinion, she echoed Heymanowa: Couldn't the screenwriters' imagination come up with a more pleasant combination? These trivialities, moralisms, displays of human inferiority, the incredibly low level of the characters, the poor atmosphere of each script, this mixing of school with dancing always characterizes films made in Poland. Additionally, she sarcastically referred to the music, which should be at a concert level, not a revue level.\nOther press reviewers, including Kino, Wiadomości Filmowe, 5-ta Rano, Kurier Czerwony, and Kurier Poznański, while pointing out some flaws in the film, expressed positive opinions about it. Some of them compared the beginning of Zapomniana melodia, with the schoolgirls singing while kayaking, to the first scenes of Mad About Music (1938, directed by Norman Taurog) with Deanna Durbin at the helm, where a group of boarders sang while riding bicycles on a wide avenue. Additionally, they unanimously agreed that the acting was very good. A reviewer, hiding under the pseudonym \"Kl.\", was of the opinion that: Grossówna and Andrzejewska here appear as if racing nobly for the palm of precedence, which must be awarded to each of them, as they created two distinct types of boarders: the scatterbrain and the romantic. We're short on lovers here. But it must be admitted that Żabczyński is faultless in his role. He loves and sings as required, he's handsome and photogenic. The lack of a second lover is not only lamented by Polish cinema... The burden of comedy is divided among several stars borrowed from the stage: on the reliable Fertner, on the professionally seconding him in the amusing role of the devoted secretary Sielański, who in turn is always perfectly matched even in bit parts by Orwid and Grabowski.\n\n\n=== Years later ===\nLeszek Armatys dedicated an essay to the production, in which he stated that the smoothly executed Zapomniana melodia brought relaxation and cheerfulness to Poles during the increasingly real threat of war. The critic praised the creators for assembling a cast of movie stars and entrusting them with roles consistent with their typecasting, refreshing the comedic formula by adding a group of girls unseen before in Polish cinema, fulfilling the role of revue girls. Additionally, he appreciated the skillful use of the formula of American sentimental comedies, driving the action with continuous misunderstandings, and using musical scenes (the jazzy vocal-dance improvisation of Frère Jacques canon by the girls on assembled school benches). In summarizing his statement, he complained about escapism, shallowness, and vulgarity of some comedic devices, but above all, he praised Zapomniana melodia because next to a few other films made at the end of the Second Polish Republic, it was a work (among comedies – the only one!) in which a certain efficiency of execution finally began to pay off after decades of experience: a certain efficiency of execution was revealed, expected for years. And even more: as if there was a certain distance from the operetta convention used commonly in Polish film comedies. Film scholars and film historians such as Tadeusz Lubelski, Jan F. Lewandowski, Marek Haltof, and Jerzy Toeplitz considered Zapomniana melodia to be a first-rate musical comedy of the interwar period in terms of craftsmanship.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\nSongs performed in the film by the original group were soon performed by various singers for record labels:\n\nFrère Jacques (Swing-Foxtrot) – Adam Aston accompanied by the Dance Orchestra Syrena Record; conductor: Henryk Wars (December 1938)\nAch, jak przyjemnie!

        "content": "The Canadian Grand Masters is an annual event celebrating traditional fiddling in Canada. Considered \"the pinnacle of Canadian fiddling,\"  the core of the event is a concert/dance on Friday evening, followed by the competition the following day. Upwards of thirty contestants are selected to compete from across Canada, considered to be the top exceptional fiddlers from each province/territory.  The winner of the contest earns the title of Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Champion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe Canadian Grand Masters is hosted by the Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Association (CGMFA), founded in 1989. Their mission is to support the preservation of traditional fiddle styles and recognize astounding Canadian fiddlers. In this effort, they elected to hold the first national championship the following year, originally known as the \"Canadian Grand Masters Championship.\" For the first six years, the contest was held on Labour Day weekend before being changed in 1996 to the last weekend of August. The contest’s purpose is to draw attention to and provide space for the traditional Canadian fiddling styles from across the country, while providing a space to showcase the country's top fiddlers. Aurora Fiddle Society member Teresa Watson noted that \"it's also a chance to meet people who are significant in the fiddling world,\" adding that besides the space to perform, the contest is major social connecting event for Canadian fiddlers. According to the CGMFA rules, the recognized styles include: country, old time, Cape Breton, Swing, Métis, Bluegrass, and French-Canadian. Classical, jazz, blues, and similar non-traditional styles are not accepted.\n\n\n=== The Event ===\nThe Canadian Grand Masters competition weekend in recent years consists of a dance/concert on Friday night, and the preliminaries, finals, a junior showcase, and Hall of Honour Inductees ceremony on Saturday.  The preliminaries feature each contestant performing their set in a randomly selected order. At the end of this section, the top ten will be chosen to play again that evening in the finals before the winners are chosen from them. Up until 2020, a top eleven performed at the finals, but this has been changed to a top ten in recent years. Their first ever contestant was Keith Ross of New Minas, Nova Scotia.\nBesides the finals, the Saturday evening’s entertainment also includes a showcase performance from the judges and the Junior Showcase. The latter features a small selection of young fiddlers from across Canada, chosen by the CGMFA, who play their own tunes of choice in a non-competitive environment. Many of these performers go on to compete in the main contest in later years.\nSaturday’s events also include the introduction of new honourees to the Canadian Fiddle Hall of Honour. Started in 2022, CGMFA board members voted to combine their previous awards of recognition (Lifetime Achievement, Award of Merit, and Canadian Fiddle Legends Award) into a Hall of Honour. Five to seven recipients are chosen each year to be inducted into the Hall at the Canadian Grand Masters competition.\n\n\n=== Impact of the Event and CGMFA ===\nBy 2008, CGMFA became a national arts organization, showcasing its importance at a national level. Two years later, they achieved their charitable tax status. Canadian Fiddler Matthew Johnson also noted the difference in atmosphere between the Canadian Grand Masters and other fiddle contests, noting the Grand Masters is more professional, with former president of CGMFA Bruce Cummings noting that the atmosphere is different largely due to its invitational nature, theatre venue, and structure. In its over thirty years, the Canadian Grand Masters established itself as the top tier competition in the country. Journalist Frank Peebles noted that \"it's one of the hardest climbs in the Canadian fiddle world. Getting called to compete at the Grand Masters is a career watermark for any fiddler who gets their name on that coveted list.\"\n\nBesides the competition, the CGMFA also organizes workshops throughout the year, promotes National Fiddling Day events, and also launched The Canadian Fiddler newsletter in 1993. The newsletters feature events, news on fiddlers and fiddling in the country, interviews, results, tunes, and upcoming events.\nSince its incorporation in 1990, over 900 contestants have competed at the Canadian Grand Masters (including those who have competed multiple times). As of 2023, the vast majority (176) are from Ontario. While no contestants have yet entered from Nunavut, the contest has seen more contestants from the Northwest Territories than Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe championship consists of upwards of thirty contestants. This number depends on the amount of representatives chosen from each province/territory who are able to attend. Each contestant must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and be a member in good standing of the association. It is a closed championship, meaning that contestants must qualify according to the contest's eligibility criteria to compete. The contestants are considered to be fiddling experts.\nContests can be eligible for the annual competition by the following methods:\n\nInvited by the CGMFA to be a provincial/territorial representative.\nFinished in the Top 10 the previous year.\nPast champion of any year since 1990.\nAt the decision of the board of directors.\nEach province/territory is allowed to send up to five contestants each year, although the host province/territory can send seven.\nDuring the preliminary round, contestants play a waltz, jig, reel/breakdown/hornpipe, and a tune of choice (that is not a waltz, jig, or reel) in any order in under 5 minutes. The Grand Masters judges sit behind the contestants on stage, listening to the contestants as they play with no additional audio equipment for aid. These three judges will then judge the contestants on intonation, technical ability, danceability, overall accuracy, emotion/feeling, and variety. The top ten from their marks will then proceed to the finals.\nThose chosen for the finals must play a new set of a waltz, jig, reel, and tune of choice. In the event of a tie in the top three, those tied will play another set of three tunes in 4 minutes and be judged again.\n\n\n== Issues with Diversity ==\nAlthough issues with diversity amongst the fiddle circuit go beyond the Canadian Grand Masters, research on the event highlights issues it faced with gender.\nExamining the culture of fiddling contests in Ontario in the early 2000s (Canadian Grand Masters was held in Ottawa for most of its existence), Shirley Ann Johnson interviewed women fiddlers to understand if gender impacted competitions. Although Johnson notes that most did not experience any limitations based on gender, fiddler and judge Karen Reid, Reid notes that there was a \"definite old boy's school attitude\" when it came to contests, with several comments made to her about being \"good for a girl.\"\nJohnson notes that since the 1970s, women fiddlers are often discouraged from competition in championships and open groups due to perceptions of gendered skill differences and a lack of role models. Women winning champion titles were often treated as unordinary and unexpected. In terms of the Canadian Grand Masters, Johnson also highlights instances where perceptions also influenced the judging. In 1997, one judge's top eleven were all women, and he was asked to change his marks. In the end, the top eleven that year were made up of ten men and one woman, April Verch. Verch won the title, and also won the Canadian Open Old Time Fiddle Championship the following year in which Verch noted several comments were made to discredit her win because of her gender, such as \"it's time for a woman to win, so that's why [you won] it.\"\nJohnson concludes with the belief that the stereotype no longer exists. The results of the Canadian Grand Masters show some changes in the statistics and gender divide that support Johnson’s statement. As of 2023, out of the 360 contestants who have placed in the top eleven/ten, about 68 per cent (245) are men, while 32 per cent (115) are women. There are four years out of 33 where women made up the majority in the top eleven/ten (2001, 2002, 2006, and 2017), although there are six years that only one or two women made the top eleven/ten (1997, 1998, and 2008 all had one woman in the finals, 2010, 2022, and 2023 had two). Looking at the top three contestants each year, out of the 99 contestants who placed in the top three, only 13 were women. Of the 33 winners, only six champion titles were won by women, with two women having won more than once.  While women have won the Canadian Grand Masters championship more often than at the Canadian Open, they are also statistically less likely to make the finals.\nBesides gender, the Canadian Grand Masters has made steps to ensure cultural diversity and support variety of fiddlers and styles from across Canada. Their contests recognize and accept a range of traditional fiddling, including Indigenous/Métis styles, and several top fiddlers and judges are Métis/Indigenous. The movement of the event each year across Canada between different cities also enables and attracts a wider range of fiddlers, and provides better access to the competition for those that would otherwise be unable to travel cross-country. In 2024, the Canadian Grand Masters will be held for the first time in Whitehorse, Yukon, again providing access to the contest for those that might not be able to travel, while also providing space for Northern fiddlers and fiddle styles to shine.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\nWinners of the Canadian Grand Masters contest become the Canadian Grand Master Champion. The contest also recognizes the first and second runner ups. In 2019, Ethan Harty became the youngest fiddler to win the contest at the age of 17.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanadian Grand Masters Fiddling Association",

        "content": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is an American nonprofit human rights organization founded in 1920.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== CLB era ===\n\nThe ACLU developed from the National Civil Liberties Bureau (CLB), co-founded in 1917 during World War I by Crystal Eastman, an attorney activist, and Roger Nash Baldwin. The focus of the CLB was on freedom of speech, primarily anti-war speech, and on supporting conscientious objectors who did not want to serve in World War I.\nThree United States Supreme Court decisions in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against certain anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.\nIn 1918, Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues. After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.\nThe CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.\nDuring the first decades of the ACLU, Baldwin continued as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a minimal salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee and was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. New Yorkers dominated the ACLU's headquarters. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.\n\n\n=== Free speech era ===\nIn the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.\n\nACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays, and Norman Thomas, believed that direct, militant action was the best path. Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak, felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change.\nDuring the 1920s, the ACLU's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general and speech within the labor movement particularly. Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.\nIn addition to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of espoused opinions. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.\nGovernment officials routinely hounded the Communist Party USA, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU. At the same time, the Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal conduct such as denying their party membership under oath. This led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders sometimes attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives, whereas Communists tried to disrupt speeches by critics of the USSR. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.\n\n\n=== Public schools ===\n\n\n==== Scopes trial ====\nWhen 1925 arrived – five years after the ACLU was formed – the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded John T. Scopes to defy Tennessee's anti-evolution law in The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes. Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The ACLU lost the case, and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law. Still, it overturned the conviction on a technicality.\nThe Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major US newspaper. The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.\nBaldwin was involved in a significant free speech victory of the 1920s after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey. Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgment in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given \"liberal and comprehensive construction\", and it marked a major turning point in the civil rights movement, signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.\nThe most important ACLU case of the 1920s was Gitlow v. New York, in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence when he distributed literature promoting communism. Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the incorporation doctrine) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.\n\n\n==== Pierce v. Society of Sisters ====\n\nAfter the First World War, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about the assimilation of immigrants and worries about \"foreign\" values. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the Oregon Compulsory Education Act. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. It was promoted by groups such as the Knights of Pythias, the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good Government League, the Orange Order, and the Ku Klux Klan.\nThe Oregon Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by 1926. Associate Director Roger Nash Baldwin, a personal friend of Luke E. Hart, the then–Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, offered to join forces with the Knights to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.\nThe case became known as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a United States Supreme Court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best. It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.\n\n\n=== Early strategy ===\nLeaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that legislation was the best long-term solution because the Supreme Court could not (and – in his opinion – should not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollak, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.\n\n\n=== Free speech expansion ===\n\nCensorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed obscene or offensive and prohibited meetings or literature promoting unions or labor organizations. Starting in 1926, the ACLU expanded its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature. In that year, H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce. The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases.\nThe Comstock laws banned the distribution of sex education information based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior. Mary Ware Dennett was fined $300 in 1928 for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge Learned Hand ruled that the pamphlet's primary purpose was to \"promote understanding\".\nThe success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech to encompass movies, press, radio, and literature. The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort. By the early 1930s, censorship in the United States was diminishing.\nTwo major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLU's campaign to promote free speech. In Stromberg v. California, decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment. In Near v. Minnesota, also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.\n\n\n== 1930s ==\nThe late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association, began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States. Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.\nThe ACLU played a significant role in passing the 1932 Norris–La Guardia Act, a federal law that prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, marriages, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.\nAlthough the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU engaged in educational efforts and published Black Justice in 1931, a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system. Funded by the Garland Fund, the ACLU also participated in producing the influential Margold Report, which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks. The ACLU planned to demonstrate that the \"separate but equal\" policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.\n\n\n=== Depression era and the New Deal ===\nIn 1932 – twelve years after the ACLU was founded – it had achieved significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general. But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.\nThe Franklin D. Roosevelt administration proposed the New Deal to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs and because the National Recovery Administration suspended antitrust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, a member of the ACLU.\nThe economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances that banned screenings deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned, as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938, issue, which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans but did not prevail.\nThe Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s; it used its influence to promote the censorship of movies and to discourage the publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented again until the 1970s.\nThe ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 court-packing plan, which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.\nThe first decision that marked the court's new direction was De Jonge v. Oregon, in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization. The ACLU attorney Osmond Fraenkel, working with International Labor Defense, defended De Jonge in 1937 and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that \"peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.\" The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Frank Murphy) established a body of civil liberties law. In 1938, Justice Harlan F. Stone wrote the famous \"footnote four\" in United States v. Carolene Products Co. in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would – henceforth – require compelling justification.\nSenator Robert F. Wagner proposed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, the ACLU initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU because, in 1937, it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.\nThe ACLU's support of the NLRB was a significant development for the ACLU because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties. Until 1937, the ACLU felt that citizens and private organizations best upheld civil rights.\nSome factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions to becoming a legal aid society centered on store front offices in low-income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena and be more willing to compromise their ideals to strike deals with politicians. The ACLU leadership also rejected this initiative.\n\n\n=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===\nThe ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints has produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties. One such defendant was the Jehovah's Witnesses, who were involved in a large number of Supreme Court cases. Cases that the ACLU supported included Lovell v. City of Griffin (which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute \"literature of any kind\"); Martin v. Struthers (which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and Cantwell v. Connecticut (which reversed the conviction of a Witness who was reciting offensive speech on a street corner).\nThe most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes. The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs. Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag. The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court, but the court affirmed the conviction in 1940. But three years later, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote, \"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\" To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on Flag Day.\n\n\n=== Communism and totalitarianism ===\n\nThe rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany, Russia, and other countries that rejected freedom of speech and association greatly impacted the civil liberties movement in the US; anti-Communist sentiment rose, and civil liberties were curtailed.\nThe ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro-Nazi speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU defended numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.\nIn the late 1930s, the ACLU allied itself with the Popular Front, a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the United States Communist Party. The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York-based ACLU. The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a \"Communist front\", particularly because Harry F. Ward was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the American League Against War and Fascism, a Communist organization.\nThe House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States. When witnesses testified at its hearings, the ACLU was mentioned several times, leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report. This damaged the ACLU's reputation severely, even though the report said that it could not \"definitely state whether or not\" the ACLU was a Communist organization.\nWhile the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a Communist front, it also protected witnesses harassed by the HUAC. The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against the passage of the Smith Act in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism. The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader Harry Bridges.\nACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of Communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-Communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from Communism; opposing them were Harry F. Ward, Corliss Lamont, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-Communists prevailed in February 1940 when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Ward immediately resigned, and – following a contentious six-hour debate – Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.\n\n\n== Mid-century ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nPrior to U.S. entry into World War II, more Americans than ever viewed the Bill of Rights as a hallowed document, and numerous organizations promoted the principle of civil liberties. Chicago and New York proclaimed \"Civil Rights\" weeks, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day. Eleanor Roosevelt was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention. \nThe ACLU had a decidedly mixed civil liberties record during World War II.  While there were far fewer sedition prosecutions than in World War I, this did not mean that President Roosevelt was more tolerant of dissent than Wilson had been.  The primary explanation was that prosecutors, working under similar laws, had fewer plausible targets because almost everyone rallied to the war effort after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  \nDespite this, Roosevelt put constant pressure on Attorney General Francis Biddle to take legal action against his prominent pre-war critics including the so-called “Patterson-McCormick Axis” of Robert McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Daily Tribune, Joseph Medill Patterson, the publisher of the New York Daily News, and his sister Cissy Patterson, the publisher of the Washington Times-Herald.  \nPartly to appease the president, Biddle finally charged thirty much lesser-known individuals for violating the Smith Act.  Although many of the defendants did not know each other, and most lived in scattered locations in the U.S., they were all tried at once in Washington, D.C. in the Sedition Trial of 1944   Despite efforts by Roger N. Baldwin, Norman Thomas, Thurgood Marshall, and others in the leadership to get the ACLU to go on record condemning the trial (Baldwin called it \"monstrous,\") the board of directors overruled them. \nThe ACLU also had a mixed record on fighting wartime restrictions on the press.  It was silent when the U.S. Post Office revoked the second class mailing privileges of Social Justice, the magazine of Father Charles E. Coughlin.  On the other hand, it extended legal aid to the publishers of the Militant of the Socialist Workers Party and the Boise Valley Herald when their mailing rights were revoked.  The ACLU was unable to prevent extensive extralegal harassment of the black press by the FBI and other agencies. The ACLU's shortcomings in defending civil liberties inspired the contemporary saying \"born in World War I and died in World War II.\"\n\n\n==== Japanese American internment ====\n\nTwo months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt authorized the creation of military \"exclusion zones\" with Executive Order 9066, paving the way for the detention of all West Coast Japanese Americans in inland camps. In addition to the non-citizen Issei (prohibited from naturalization as members of an \"unassimilable\" race), over two-thirds of those swept up were American-born citizens. \nBaldwin criticized Roosevelt's plan but then qualified his comments by saying that Executive Order 9066 was \"undoubtedly legal in principle.\"  The Board of Directors settled into a long debate.  It was divided between Roosevelt loyalists, such as Morris Ernst and Corliss Lamont, who did not want to challenge the administration, and more absolutist civil libertarians such as Baldwin, Thurgood Marshall, and Norman Thomas. \nThe ACLU itself only sent a letter of protest to the president on March 20, 1942, more than a month after Executive Order 9066.   Signed by Baldwin, it called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings but not challenge the constitutionality of the order.\nThe suggestion for a loyalty hearings option went nowhere, and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the \"evacuation\" of the West Coast. In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose \"presence may endanger national security\", brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens; on June 22, instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.\nThe ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans; however, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on before the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.\nThe West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court. However, they had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case and with the same results). Still, he kept his arguments within the national office's parameters. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.\nKorematsu v. United States proved to be the most controversial of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to the national ACLU office's pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation. At the same time, Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually, Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles Horsky; however, their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based on the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed. The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans, although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the 1980s. Legal scholar Peter Irons later asserted that the national office of the ACLU's decision not to challenge the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066 directly had \"crippled the effective presentation of these appeals to the Supreme Court\".\nThe national office of the ACLU was even more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 that declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States' war effort. Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who renounced their US citizenship during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for \"repatriation\". (A significant number of those slated to \"go back\" to Japan had never actually been to the country and were being deported rather than repatriated.) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the Tule Lake Segregation Center, where the majority of these \"renunciants\" were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case independently, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support.\nDuring his 1944 visit to Tule Lake, Besig had also become aware of a hastily constructed stockade in which Japanese American internees were routinely being brutalized and held for months without due process. The national ACLU office forbade Besig to intervene on behalf of the stockade prisoners or even to visit the Tule Lake camp without prior written approval from Baldwin. Unable to help directly, Besig turned to Wayne Collins for assistance. Using the threat of habeas corpus suits, Collins managed to have the stockade closed down. A year later, after learning that the stockade had been reestablished, he returned to the camp and had it closed down for good.\n\n\n==== End of WWII in 1945 ====\nWhen the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old and had accumulated impressive legal victories. President Harry S. Truman sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary. American attitudes had changed since World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness. The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed. During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, including racial discrimination and separation of church and state.\nThe ACLU supported the African-American defendants in Shelley v. Kraemer, when they tried to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood with racially restrictive housing covenants. The African-American purchasers won the case in 1945.\n\n\n=== Cold War era ===\nAnti-Communist sentiment gripped the United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to lose jobs, become blocklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored the civil rights of Communists, other civil liberties – such as due process in law and separation of church and state – continued to be reinforced and even expanded.\nThe ACLU was internally divided when it purged Communists from its leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections and that the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to most anti-Communist leaders' resignations.\nIn 1947, President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, which created the Federal Loyalty Program. This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations that were deemed to be subversive. Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment. Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list, nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list. Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.\nAlso in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending to ask them to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported several artists' appeals but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings and created a blacklist that prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blocklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blocklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blocklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.\n\nThe federal government took direct aim at the US Communist Party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose not to represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison, and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.\nIn a change of heart, the ACLU supported the party leaders during their appeal process. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the Dennis v. United States decision by softening the free speech requirements from a \"clear and present danger\" test to a \"grave and probable\" test. The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the Dennis decision, and resolved to fight it. One reason for the Supreme Court's support of Cold War legislation was the 1949 deaths of Supreme Court justices Frank Murphy and Wiley Rutledge, leaving Hugo Black and William O. Douglas as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court.\nThe Dennis decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other Communist party members. The ACLU supported many Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters), but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.\nThe ACLU challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country, but the courts upheld most loyalty oath laws. California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath. The Supreme Court, until 1957, upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists.\nThe ACLU, even though it scaled back its defense of Communists during the Cold War, still came under heavy criticism as a \"front\" for Communism. Critics included the American Legion, Senator Joseph McCarthy, the HUAC, and the FBI. Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI, and as a consequence, the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War.\nIn 1950, Raymond L. Wise, ACLU board member 1933–1951, defended William Perl, one of the other spies embroiled in the atomic espionage cases (made famous by the execution of Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg). However, the ACLU publicly endorsed the guilty verdict in the Rosenberg case. The ACLU took the position that the execution of the Rosenbergs did not involve a civil rights issue.\n\n\n=== Organizational change ===\nIn 1950, the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin. Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955 – the start of 24 years of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.\nThe ACLU, controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year; in later decades, it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.\n\n\n=== McCarthy era ===\n\nDuring the early 1950s, the ACLU continued to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, even though he was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose not to defend him. The ACLU later reversed their stance and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.\nIn response to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees chose to use the fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs. Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established policies which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment. The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the fifth amendment, but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case, which reversed his termination.\nThe fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in 1954, which finally resolved the ACLU's ambivalence by ousting the anti-communists from ACLU leadership. In 1953, the anti-communists, led by Norman Thomas and James Fly, proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment. These resolutions were the first that fell under the ACLU's new organizational rules permitting local affiliates to participate in the vote; the affiliates outvoted the national headquarters and rejected the anti-communist resolutions. Anti-communist leaders refused to accept the results of the vote and brought the issue up for discussion again at the 1954 bi-annual convention. ACLU member Frank Graham, president of the University of North Carolina, attacked the anti-communists with a counter-proposal, which stated that the ACLU \"stand[s] against guilt by association, judgment by accusation, the invasion of privacy of personal opinions and beliefs, and the confusion of dissent with disloyalty\". The anti-communists continued to battle Graham's proposal but were outnumbered by the affiliates. The anti-communists finally gave up and departed the board of directors in late 1954 and 1955, ending an eight-year ambivalence within the ACLU leadership ranks. After that, the ACLU proceeded with firmer resolve against Cold War anti-communist legislation. The period from the 1940 resolution (and the purge of Elizabeth Flynn) to the 1954 resignation of the anti-communist leaders is considered by many to be an era in which the ACLU abandoned its core principles.\nMcCarthyism declined in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that the Cold War generated ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties. In 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and after that, a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.\nThe Supreme Court handed the ACLU two key victories in 1957, in Watkins v. United States and Yates v. United States, both of which undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. Postmaster General (in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.\n\n\n== 1960s ==\nThe decade from 1954 to 1964 was the most successful period in the ACLU's history. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. During the ACLU's bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases involving the ACLU; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight. The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects. The ACLU's success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, tolerant, and willing to accept unorthodox behavior.\n\n\n=== Separation of church and state ===\n\nLegal battles concerning the separation of church and state originated in laws dating to 1938, which required religious instruction in school or provided state funding for religious schools. The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws, and the primary opponents (the \"separationists\") were the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the American Jewish Congress. The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 Everson v. Board of Education case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote \"[t]he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state.... That wall must be kept high and impregnable.\" It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a \"national school board\", and that the Constitution did not govern social issues. However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional. Historian Samuel Walker writes that the ACLU's \"greatest impact on American life\" was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to \"constitutionalize\" so many public controversies.\nIn 1948, the ACLU prevailed in the McCollum v. Board of Education case, which challenged public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for by private funds. The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico that were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to the in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.\nHowever, not all cases were victories; ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. The Supreme Court has never overturned such laws, although some states subsequently revoked many of the laws under pressure from commercial interests.\n\n\n=== Freedom of expression ===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU continued its battle against censorship of art and literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing President Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beauharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.\nCities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be \"harmful\", \"offensive\", or \"immoral\" – censorship which was validated by the 1915 Mutual v. Ohio Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce, undeserving of first amendment protection. The film The Miracle was banned in New York in 1951 at the behest of the Catholic Church, but the ACLU supported the film's distributor in an appeal of the ban, and won a major victory in the 1952 decision Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson. The Catholic Church led efforts throughout the 1950s attempting to persuade local prosecutors to ban various books and movies, leading to conflict with the ACLU when the ACLU published it statement condemning the church's tactics. Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as M and la Ronde, leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship. Hollywood continued employing self-censorship with its own Production Code, but in 1956 the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code.\nThe ACLU defended beat generation artists, including Allen Ginsberg who was prosecuted for his poem \"Howl\"; and – in an unorthodox case –  the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace of the neighborhood.\nThe ACLU lost an important press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, books such as Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal through the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971, obscenity prosecutions had halted.\n\n\n=== Racial discrimination ===\nA major aspect of civil liberties progress after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments –  an effort generally associated with the civil rights movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.\nIn 1954, the ACLU filed an amicus brief in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, which led to the ban on racial segregation in US public schools. Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting to force it to disclose membership lists. The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964, the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower-income urban residents, in Reynolds v. Sims, which required states to establish the voting districts following the \"one person, one vote\" principle.\n\n\n=== Police misconduct ===\nThe ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama (right to an attorney), and including 1942's Betts v. Brady (right to an attorney), and 1951's Rochin v. California (involuntary stomach pumping). In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct. In 1958, the Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia to create the nation's first civilian police review board. In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, Secret Detention by the Chicago Police which documented unlawful detention by police.\nSome of the most notable ACLU successes came in the 1960s when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers also used the services of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit, which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.\n\n\n=== Civil liberties revolution of the 1960s ===\nThe 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent explosive growth. Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people and often employed tactics such as sit ins and marches. Protests were often peaceful but sometimes employed militant tactics. The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as gay rights, prisoner's rights, abortion, rights of the poor, and the death penalty. Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade to 104,000 in 1970. In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states. During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation in tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving amicus briefs submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested. At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from \"disengaged and elitist\" to \"emotionally engaged\". The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled How Americans Protest, which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.\nAfrican-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students staged a sit-in in a segregated North Carolina department store, the sit-in movement gained momentum across the United States. During 1960–61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help for the Freedom Rides in 1961, the integration of the University of Mississippi, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and the 1964 Freedom Summer.\nThe NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors – white and black – who were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC), which provided legal representation to many protesters. The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.\nIn 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan Jr., the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. Morgan was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. In 1966, the southern office successfully represented African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, after the Georgia House of Representatives refused to admit Bond into the legislature on the basis that he was an admitted pacifist opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 US 733 (1974).\nIn 1969, the ACLU won a significant victory for free speech when it defended Dick Gregory after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in Gregory v. Chicago that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a \"heckler's veto\".\n\n\n=== Vietnam War ===\nThe ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending draft resisters, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the potential impeachment of Richard Nixon, and the use of national security concerns to preemptively censor newspapers.\nDavid J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his draft card. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: United States of America v. David J. Miller, 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in United States v. O'Brien, 391 US 367 (1968). Thirteen-year-old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District. This critical case established that the government may not establish \"enclaves\" such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeited.\n\nThe ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader James Meredith. In the Street v. New York decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was a constitutionally protected form of expression. The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words \"fuck the draft\" on its back while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in Cohen v. California, held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.\nNon-war-related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a Ku Klux Klan member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision Brandenburg v. Ohio, which held that only speech which advocated imminent violence could be outlawed.\nA major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial and provided legal advice without regard to the defendants' political views. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step toward politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based on various legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and claiming that the war was illegal.\nAlso in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing \"direct\" legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant) and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent). Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work, which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.\n\n\n== 1970s and 1980s ==\n\n\n=== Watergate era ===\n\nThe ACLU supported The New York Times in its 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the Pentagon Papers. The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co. v. United States ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action.\nOn September 30, 1973, the ACLU became first national organization to publicly call for the impeachment and removal from office of President Richard Nixon. Six civil liberties violations were cited as grounds: \"specific proved violations of the rights of political dissent; usurpation of Congressional war‐making powers; establishment of a personal secret police which committed crimes; attempted interference in the trial of Daniel Ellsberg; distortion of the system of justice and perversion of other Federal agencies\". One month later, after the House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry against him, the organization released a 56‐page handbook detailing \"17 things citizens could do to bring about the impeachment of President Nixon\". This resolution, when placed beside the earlier resolution opposing the Vietnam war, convinced many ACLU critics, particularly conservatives, that the organization had transformed into a liberal political organization.\n\n\n=== Enclaves and new civil liberties ===\nThe decade from 1965 to 1975 saw an expansion of civil liberties. Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing Aryeh Neier to take over from Pemberton as executive director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU; he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds and created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.\nDuring those years, the ACLU worked to expand legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run \"enclaves\", new rights for members of what it called \"victim groups\", and privacy rights for citizens in general. At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs \"enclaves\", which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, military members, prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice Abe Fortas's use of the phrase \"schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism\" in the Tinker v. Des Moines decision.\nThe ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the Tinker v. Des Moines case and expanded it with cases such as Goss v. Lopez, which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.\nAs early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision, the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous but create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a woman with mental illness who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.\nBefore 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners subject to police brutality or deprived of religious reading material. In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney Phil Hirschkop discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the Virginia State Penitentiary strike and won an important victory in 1971's Landman v. Royster which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways. In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the National Prison Project. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as Ruiz v. Estelle (requiring reform of the Texas prison system), and in 1996 US Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.\n\n\n=== Victim groups ===\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include what it referred to as \"victim groups\", namely women, the poor, and homosexuals. Heeding the call of female members, the ACLU endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1970 and created the Women's Rights Project in 1971. The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the National Organization for Women, including breakthrough cases such as Reed v. Reed, Frontiero v. Richardson, and  Taylor v. Louisiana.\nACLU leader Harriet Pilpel raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later, the ACLU formally endorsed gay rights. In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher. The US District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for \"immorality\" was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher. The court refused to reinstate the teacher, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a 2-to-1 vote. In 1973, the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project (later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project), which combated discrimination against homosexuals. This support continued into the 2000s. For example, after then-Senator Larry Craig was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom in 2007, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights.\nThe rights of the poor were another area that the ACLU expanded. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. However, the ACLU played a key role in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.\n\n\n=== Reproductive Freedom Project ===\nThe ACLU founded the Reproductive Freedom Project in 1974 to defend individuals the government obstructs in cases involving access to abortions, birth control, or sexual education. According to its mission statement, the project works to provide access to reproductive health care for individuals. The project also opposes abstinence-only sex education, arguing that it promotes an unwillingness to use contraceptives.\nIn 1980, the Project filed Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital which attempted to overturn Buck v. Bell, the 1927 US Supreme Court decision which had allowed the Commonwealth of Virginia to legally sterilize persons it deemed to be mentally defective without their permission. Though the Court did not overturn Buck v.Bell, in 1985, the state agreed to provide counseling and medical treatment to the survivors among the 7,200 to 8,300 people sterilized between 1927 and 1979. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the federal circuit court case that led to federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981–1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v. Minnesota, which resulted in the Supreme Court overturning a state law requiring both parents to be notified before a minor could legally have an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being challenged for educating about sexuality and AIDS. In 1995, the Project filed an amicus brief in Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth, which allowed for the distribution of condoms in a public school.\nThe Reproductive Freedom Project focuses on three ideas: (1) to \"reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country\" (2) to \"block state and federal welfare \"reform\" proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare, unmarried women, or teenagers\" and (3) to \"stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks\". The Project proposes to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation.\n\n\n=== Privacy ===\nThe right to privacy is not explicitly identified in the US Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive Poe v. Ullman (1961) case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position and formally declared a right to privacy. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided; in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch (1971), which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions, Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion throughout the United States. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).\nRelated to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act, which required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act, which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.\n\n\n=== Allegations of bias ===\nIn the early 1970s, conservatives and libertarians began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal. Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Spock's anti-war protests. Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace judicial activism. Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like Roe v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut violated the intention of the authors of the Bill of Rights. The ACLU became an issue in the 1988 presidential campaign, when Republican candidate George H. W. Bush accused Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis (a member of the ACLU) of being a \"card carrying member of the ACLU\".\n\n\n=== The Skokie case ===\n\nIn 1977, the National Socialist Party of America, led by Frank Collin, applied to the town of Skokie, Illinois, for a permit to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Skokie refused to grant the NSPA a permit and passed ordinances against hate speech and military wear, in addition to requiring an insurance bond. Skokie's Village Council ordered village attorney, Harvey Schwartz, to seek an injunction to stop the demonstration. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court, eventually prevailing in NSPA v. Village of Skokie\nThe Skokie case was heavily publicized across America, partially because Jewish groups such as the Jewish Defense League and Anti Defamation League strenuously objected to the demonstration, leading many members of the ACLU to cancel their memberships. The Illinois affiliate of the ACLU lost about 25% of its membership and nearly one-third of its budget. The financial strain from the controversy led to layoffs at local chapters. After the membership crisis died down, the ACLU sent out a fund-raising appeal which explained their rationale for the Skokie case and raised over $500,000 ($2,514,003 in 2023 dollars).\n\n\n=== Reagan era ===\n\nThe inauguration of Ronald Reagan as president in 1981 ushered in an eight-year period of conservative leadership in the US government. Under Reagan's leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda.\nFifty years after the Scopes trial, the ACLU found itself fighting another classroom case, the Arkansas 1981 creationism statute, which required schools to teach the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The ACLU won the case in the McLean v. Arkansas decision.\nIn 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed. However, the law was overly restrictive because it banned artistic displays and non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, Vice President George H. W. Bush noted that his opponent Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis had described himself as a \"card-carrying member of the ACLU\" and used that as evidence that Dukakis was \"a strong, passionate liberal\" and \"out of the mainstream\". The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\nIn 1990, the ACLU defended Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, whose conviction was tainted by coerced testimony – a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights – during the Iran–Contra affair, where Oliver North was involved in illegal weapons sales to Iran to illegally fund the Contra guerillas.\nIn 1997, ruling unanimously in the case of Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, the Supreme Court voided the anti-indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act (the CDA), finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the First Amendment. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's \"use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean.\"\nIn 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti-spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such, \"Standardized labeling is compelled speech.\" He also stated, \"It's relatively simple to click and delete.\" The debate found the ACLU joining with the Direct Marketing Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported \"opt-out\" requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 CAN-SPAM act suggesting that it could have a chilling effect on speech in cyberspace. It has been criticized for this position.\nIn November 2000, 15 African-American residents of Hearne, Texas, were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of \"drug sweeps\". The ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit, Kelly v. Paschall, on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne's male African-American population aged 18 to 34 were arrested based only on the \"uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases\". On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and Robertson County announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which \"both sides stated that they were satisfied with\". The District Attorney dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit. The 2009 film American Violet depicts this case.\nIn 2000, the ACLU's Massachusetts affiliate represented the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), on First Amendment grounds, in the Curley v. NAMBLA wrongful death civil suit. The organization was sued because a man who raped and murdered a child had visited the NAMBLA website. Also in 2000, the ACLU lost the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case, which had asked the Supreme Court to require the Boy Scouts of America to drop their policy of prohibiting homosexuals from becoming Boy Scout leaders.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n\n=== Free speech ===\nIn 2006, the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to disable temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.\nIn 2006, the ACLU challenged a Missouri law prohibiting picketing outside veterans' funerals. The ACLU filed the suit in support of the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper, who were threatened with arrest. The Westboro Baptist Church is well known for its picket signs that contain messages such as \"God Hates Fags\", \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\", and \"Thank God for 9/11\". The ACLU issued a statement calling the legislation a \"law that infringes on Shirley Phelps-Roper's rights to religious liberty and free speech.\" The ACLU prevailed in the lawsuit.\nThe ACLU argued in an amicus brief to the Supreme Court that a decision on the constitutionality of a Massachusetts law required the consideration of additional evidence because lower courts have undervalued the right to engage in sidewalk counseling. The law prohibited sidewalk counselors from approaching women outside abortion facilities and offering them alternatives to abortion but allowed escorts to speak with them and accompany them into the building. In overturning the law in McCullen v. Coakley, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that it violated the counselors' freedom of speech and constituted viewpoint discrimination.\nIn 2009, the ACLU filed an amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 violated the First Amendment right to free speech by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.\nIn 2012, the ACLU filed suit on behalf of the Ku Klux Klan of Georgia, claiming that the KKK was unfairly rejected from the state's \"Adopt-a-Highway\" program. The ACLU prevailed in the lawsuit.\n\n\n=== Move towards identity politics ===\nSome have claimed the ACLU is reducing its support of unpopular free speech (specifically by declining to defend speech made by conservatives) in favor of identity politics, political correctness, and progressivism. Instead, critics contend that the organization has instead become a progressive advocacy organization intensely focused on identity politics. \nOne basis of these allegations was a 2017 statement the ACLU president made to a reporter after the death of a counter-protester during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Virginia, where Romero told a reporter that the ACLU would no longer support legal cases of activists that wish to carry guns at their protests.  Another basis for these claims was an internal ACLU memo dated June 2018, discussing factors to evaluate when deciding whether to take a case. The memo listed several factors to consider, including \"the extent to which the speech may assist in advancing the goals of white supremacists or others whose views are contrary to our values.\"  \nSome analysts viewed this as a retreat from the ACLU's historically strong support of First Amendment rights, regardless of whether minorities were negatively impacted by the speech, citing the ACLU's past support for certain KKK and Nazi legal cases.  The memo's authors stated that the memo did not define a change in official ACLU policy, but was intended as a guideline to assist ACLU affiliates in deciding which cases to take. Former ACLU director Ira Glasser stated that \"the ACLU might not take the Skokie case today.\" In the 2020 documentary Mighty Ira, which chronicles Glasser's life and career at the ACLU, Glasser says he would defend the ACLU's decision to take the Skokie case again today if needed.\nIn 2021, the ACLU responded to the criticisms by denying that they are reducing their support for unpopular First Amendment causes and listing 27 cases from 2017 to 2021 where the ACLU supported a party holding an unpopular or repugnant viewpoint.  The cases included one which challenged college restrictions on hate speech; a case defending a Catholic school's right to discriminate in hiring; and a case that defended antisemitic protesters who marched outside a synagogue.\nIn 2024, the National Labor Relations Board sued the ACLU in an unfair labor practice case after the ACLU fired an Asian attorney for criticizing her Black bosses. The ACLU contended that the employee's use of phrases like \"the beatings will continue until morale improves\" was racially coded and that it \"caused serious harm to Black members of the A.C.L.U. community.\" According to Jeremy W. Peters of The New York Times, critics of the ACLU saw the firing as \"a sign of how far the group has strayed from its core mission — defending free speech — and has instead aligned itself with a progressive politics that is intensely focused on identity.\"\n\n\n=== LGBTQ issues ===\nIn March 2004, the ACLU, along with Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, sued the state of California on behalf of six same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, Woo v. Lockyer, was eventually consolidated into In re Marriage Cases, the California Supreme Court case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008, until Proposition 8 was passed on November 4, 2008. The ACLU, Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights then challenged Proposition 8 and won.\nIn 2011, the ACLU started its Don't Filter Me project, countering LGBT-related Internet censorship in public schools in the United States.\nOn January 7, 2013, the ACLU settled with the federal government in Collins v. United States that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under \"don't ask, don't tell\" since November 10, 2004, who had previously been granted only half that. Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.\nIn 2021, the ACLU filed a brief siding with a school district that had a policy of using preferred pronouns for transgender students.  Some analysts felt this was a retreat from the ACLU's historical defense of the First Amendment because the ACLU was opposing the teachers who were disciplined for refusing to use the preferred pronouns.\n\n\n=== Second amendment ===\nIn light of the Supreme Court's Heller decision recognizing that the Constitution protects an individual right to bear arms, ACLU of Nevada took a position of supporting \"the individual's right to bear arms subject to constitutionally permissible regulations\" and pledged to \"defend this right as it defends other constitutional rights\". In 2021, the ACLU supported the position that the Second Amendment was originally written to ensure that Southern states could use militias to suppress slave uprisings, and that anti-Blackness ensured its inclusion in the Bill of Rights.\n\n\n=== Anti-terrorism issues ===\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, the federal government instituted a broad range of new measures to combat terrorism, including the passage of the Patriot Act. The ACLU challenged many of the measures, claiming that they violated rights regarding due process, privacy, illegal searches, and cruel and unusual punishment. An ACLU policy statement states:\n\nOur way forward lies in decisively turning our backs on the policies and practices that violate our greatest strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies to the rule of law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security. The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.\nDuring the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security, the membership of the ACLU increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000. The growth continued, and by August 2008 ACLU membership was greater than 500,000. It remained at that level through 2011.\nThe ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the Patriot Act of 2001, the PATRIOT 2 Act of 2003, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism. In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive. The campaign required ACLU employees to be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list. The ACLU has stated that it would \"reject $500,000 in contributions from private individuals rather than submit to a government 'blacklist' policy\".\nIn 2004, the ACLU sued the federal government in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider. Under the provisions of the Patriot Act, the government had issued national security letters to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.\nIn January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, in a federal district court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. On August 17, 2006, that court ruled that the warrantless wiretapping program was unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately. However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The Bush administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the US Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.\nThe ACLU and other organizations also filed separate lawsuits against telecommunications companies. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in Illinois (Terkel v. AT&T), which was dismissed because of the state secrets privilege and two others in California requesting injunctions against AT&T and Verizon. On August 10, 2006, the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies were transferred to a federal judge in San Francisco.\nThe ACLU represents a Muslim-American who was detained but never accused of a crime in Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, a civil suit against former Attorney General John Ashcroft. In January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules, and regulations. The ACLU has also criticized targeted killings of American citizens who fight against the United States.\nOn August 10, 2020, in an opinion article for USA Today by Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU called for the dismantling of the United States Department of Homeland Security over the deployment of federal forces in July 2020 during the George Floyd protests. On August 26, 2020, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of seven protesters and three veterans following the protests in Portland, Oregon, which accused the Trump Administration of using excessive force and unlawful arrests with federal officers.\n\n\n=== Trump administration ===\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's election as president on November 8, 2016, the ACLU responded on Twitter by saying: \"Should President-elect Donald Trump attempt to implement his unconstitutional campaign promises, we'll see him in court.\" On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order indefinitely barring \"Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, refugees or otherwise, from entering the United States for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\". The ACLU responded by filing a lawsuit against the ban on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who had been detained at JFK International Airport. On January 28, 2017, District Court Judge Ann Donnelly granted a temporary injunction against the immigration order, saying it was difficult to see any harm from allowing the newly arrived immigrants to remain in the country.\nIn response to Trump's order, the ACLU raised more than $24 million from more than 350,000 individual online donations in two days. This amounted to six times what the ACLU normally receives in online donations in a year. Celebrities donating included Chris Sacca (who offered to match other people's donations and ultimately gave $150,000), Rosie O'Donnell, Judd Apatow, Sia, John Legend, and Adele. The number of members of the ACLU doubled in the time from the election to end of January to 1 million.\nGrants and contributions increased from US$106,628,381 reported by the 2016 year-end income statement to $274,104,575 by the 2017 year-end statement. The segment's primary revenue source came from individual contributions in response to the Trump presidency's infringements on civil liberties. The surge in donations more than doubled the total support and revenue of the non-profit organization year over year from 2016 to 2017. Besides filing more lawsuits than during previous presidential administrations, the ACLU has spent more money on advertisements and messaging as well, weighing in on elections and pressing political concerns. This increased public profile has drawn some accusations that the organization has become more politically partisan than in previous decades.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nIn June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement that asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision.\nIn April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU sued the City of Los Angeles, on behalf of Robert Lee Purrie and five other homeless people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting due process and equal protection, and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment). The Court ruled in favor of the ACLU, stating that \"the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row.\" Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons with nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep other than on public streets and sidewalks is breaking these amendments. The Court said the anti-camping ordinance is \"one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States\". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between 9:00 p.m. and 6:30 am. The compromise plan permitted the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they were not \"within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance\" and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise was the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the settlement. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise.\nIn 2009, the Oregon ACLU unsuccessfully opposed changing state law to permit teachers to wear religious clothing in classrooms, citing the separation of church and state principles.\nIn 2018, the ACLU conceived and ghostwrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in which Amber Heard accused her ex-husband Johnny Depp of domestic abuse, leading Depp to sue Heard for defamation in the 2022 trial Depp v. Heard. The ACLU testified in the trial that they wrote the op-ed in exchange for a $3.5 million donation pledge from Heard, and timed its release to capitalize on the press from Heard's newly released film Aquaman. The ACLU demanded $86,000 from Depp for the cost of producing documents for the case. At the end of the trial, the jury ruled that Heard had defamed Depp with actual malice in all three counts related to the Washington Post op-ed.\nIn June 2020, the ACLU sued the federal government for denying Paycheck Protection Program loans to business owners with criminal backgrounds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAlley, Robert S.

It was started in 2006, when the Saudi government set up the Jabal Omar Development Company with an initial budget of $1.6 billion, and plans to construct over 90 buildings.\nDesigns and architectural support have come from companies including Foster and Partners and Buro Happold. As of 2024, the initial vision has not been realized, but construction has included a 15-tower complex abutting the southwest edge of the Masjid al-Haram plaza, and two residential towers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWikimapia: Jabal Omar Development - Makkah\nAddress Makkah: JODC - RESIDENTIAL UNITS",

        "content": "The Tanat Valley (Welsh: Dyffryn Tanat) is a large valley in northern Powys, Wales, formed by the course of the Afon Tanat and its tributaries. Situated south of the Berwyn range, the valley forms from at Llangynog from the merger of two narrow valleys, the Cwm Pennant and Cwm Rhiwarth. Various historic sites, including the Iron Age hillfort Llwyn Bryn-Dinas and the medieval St Melangell's Church are located along the valley. Largely agrarian, sheep farming has formed a major industry in the region for several centuries. Large-scale slate and lead mining in the region lasted from the 16th to late 20th century, although earlier mines possibly existed during the Iron Age.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe alluvial valley is primarily composed of Ordovician sedimentary rocks such as mudstone and shale, with smaller amounts of tuff and calcareous rocks. Mineral deposits in the valley include galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, barite, and witherite. The soils are podzolic and rich in clay.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe tributary streams of the Afon Tanat have their sources in the Aran and Berwyn ranges along the northwestern borders of Powys. The western extent of the valley is divided into two main valleys: the Cwm Pennant, following the upper Tanat; and the Cwm Rhiwarth, following the Afon Eirth. The two river valleys merge at the village of Llangynog. The Berwyn range lies to the north of the valley, rising up to 500 meters above the valley floor, with the rolling Montgomery Hills to the south. The valley floor is generally between 100–200 metres (330–660 ft) O.D.\n\n\n=== Cwm Pennant ===\n\nThe Cwm Pennant is a narrow valley following the upper course of the Afon Tanat, prior to its merger with the Afon Eirth at Llangynog. Pennant Melangell, a former village and medieval church, is located in the valley. A small, narrow valley, the Cwm Llêch, emerges from the south of the Cwm Pennant, following the course of the Afon Goch.\n\n\n=== Cwm Blowty ===\nThe Cwm Blowty follows the Afon Rhaeadr upstream of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. A large waterfall, the Pistyll Rhaeadr, lies at the head of the valley.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and ancient settlements ===\nThe earliest evidence of human presence in the Tanat Valley dates to the Upper Palaeolithic; a barbed point from c. 12,000 BC indicates temporary hunting settlements in the area. Hunter-gatherer seasonal settlements likely existed in the Mesolithic and Neolithic. Permanent settlements were likely established in the Late Neolithic or Bronze Age. Although no settlements from the Late Neolithic period are known, several Bronze Age funerary sites are located around the valley, including henges, burial mounds, and cairns. The Rhos-y-Beddau stone circle sits in the hanging valley of the Rhaeadr, upstream of the Pistyll Rhaeadr. \nTwo Iron Age hillforts, Llwyn Bryn-Dinas and Craig Rhiwarth, lie above the valley. These may have been a center of early metallurgy, due to abundant iron ore deposits in the region. An Iron Age hut circle has been found at Garnedd Wen, east of Craig Rhiwarth. Mining likely took place at the lead mines of Cwm Orog and Crag y Mwyn during the Roman period.\n\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nPennant Melangell and Llanrhaeadr, the principal settlements of the largely rural agrarian valley, were both founded as ecclesiastical sites in the medieval period. Pennant Melangell is associated with Saint Melangell, who supposedly founded a nunnery in the area, and the shrine dedicated to her. Llanrhaeadr was formed as a clas dedicated to Saint Dogfan. Sheep farming has been a major industry in the area since the 16th century. Cattle farming also takes place in the valley.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\nLimestone quarries have long been used in the region. Slate quarries and lead mines also emerged in the 16th century, continuing into the 20th century. The 18th and 19th centuries were the period of greatest mining activity, mainly centered at the Llangynog mine. Five smaller mines surrounded Llangynog, alongside two at Cwm Hirnant. Although metal mining largely stopped after the closure of the Llangynog mine in 1899, activity at Cwm Orog continued until 1912, alongside slate and rhyolite quarrying throughout the early 20th century. Mining operations at Llangynog led to large-scale heavy metal contamination across the whole of the valley.\nThe Tanat Valley Light Railway was opened in 1904 to serve the communities in the region, continuing operations until 1964.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Bases for the Catalan Regional Constitution (in Catalan: Bases per a la Constitució Regional Catalana, Spanish: Bases para la Constitución Regional Catalana), better known as the Manresa Bases (Bases de Manresa), is the document presented as a draft Catalan regional constitution for a paper by the Unió Catalanista to the council of representatives of Catalanist associations, which met in Manresa (Barcelona) on 25 and 27 March 1892 at the initiative of the Lliga de Catalunya. The Bases de Manresa are often considered to be the \"birth certificate of political Catalanism\", at least that of conservative roots.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1887 the Centre Català underwent an acute crisis as a result of the split between the two currents that made it up, one more left-wing and federalist, led by Valentí Almirall, and the other more Catalanist and conservative, grouped around the newspaper La Renaixensa. The latter current had produced an important work published in 1878 under the title Los Fueros de Cataluña (The Charters of Catalonia), authored by Josep Coroleu and Josep Pella i Forgas. After a statement that \"from the splendid variety with which Providence has graciously endowed Catalonia has sprung the characteristic genius of her children\" —\"her fierce liberty, her practical sense\"— the ancient laws that governed the Principality of Catalonia are explained, organised in articles, as if they were a Constitution, accompanied by long digressions.\nThe first article states: \"The Catalan nation is the gathering of the peoples who speak the Catalan language. Its territory comprises: Catalonia, with the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne; the Kingdom of Valencia; the Kingdom of Majorca\". The conservative nature of the work is evident, for example, in Article 51, which states that \"only citizens who are heads of families have the right to appoint and be appointed\" to the popular arm, since the Cortes will be of a statal nature, or in Article 39, which states: \"Since the religion of the Catalans is Catholic, apostolic and Roman, it is not licit for any layman to discuss publicly or privately about its dogmas\". It also demanded that military service be carried out in Catalonia and that \"only Catalans born in the Principality and not those naturalised by privilege who are in full enjoyment of their citizenship may obtain ecclesiastical benefits and offices in Catalonia and exercise jurisdiction, public office, employment or military command in Catalonia and the Kingdom of Majorca\". After denying the legitimacy of the Spanish constituent processes initiated in the Cortes of Cadiz, Coroleu and Pella concluded that Spain must repair \"the imprescriptible rights of its peoples\" oppressed by \"the despotism of foreign dynasties [sic]\" and the \"Jacobinism of infamous politicians\".\nThe members of the conservative tendency left the Centre Catalá in November 1887 to found the Lliga de Catalunya, which was joined by the Centre Escolar Catalanista, an association of university students that included the future leaders of Catalan nationalism: Enric Prat de la Riba, Francesc Cambó and Josep Puig i Cadafalch. From that moment on, Catalan nationalist hegemony passed from the Centre Català to the Lliga, which during the Jocs Florals of 1888 presented a second memorial of wrongs to the Queen Regent in which, among other things, they asked \"that the Catalan nation should once again have its free and independent general courts\", voluntary military service, \"the official Catalan language in Catalonia\", education in Catalan, a Catalan Supreme Court and that the king should swear \"in Catalonia his fundamental constitutions\".\n\nIn 1891 the Lliga de Catalunya proposed the formation of the Unió Catalanista, which immediately gained the support of Catalanist organisations and newspapers, and also of individuals —unlike what had happened four years earlier with the failed Gran Consell Regional Català proposed by Bernat Torroja, President of the Associació Catalanista de Reus, which was intended to bring together the presidents of Catalanist organisations and the editors of related newspapers—. In March 1892, the Unió held its first assembly in Manresa, attended by 250 delegates representing some 160 localities, where the Bases per a la Constitució Regional Catalana, better known as the Bases de Manresa, were approved.\nThe presidency was held by Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Enric Prat de la Riba acted as secretary. The commission in charge of drafting the Bases was chaired by the priest Josep Torras i Bages.\n\n\n== Content ==\nBase 1 dealt with central power and the rest (Bases 2 to 17) with regional power. According to the historians Jaume Claret and Manuel Santirso, the Bases moved away from both the federalist project and the possibilism of the Memorial of Wrongs of 1885 to advocate a return to the Catalonia of pre-1714, as can be seen especially in Base 2, which preserves the old Catalan legislation; Base 3, which establishes that the Catalan language will be the only language that, [with] official character, can be used in Catalonia and in the relations of this region [with] the central power; Base 4, which reserves public posts for the natives of Catalonia; or Base 7 which establishes an annual Cortes elected by corporate suffrage of all the heads of families grouped in classes based on manual labour, on skills or professional careers and on property, industry and commerce.\nFrom the regional power, formed by a Cortes that would meet once a year in different parts of the territory, would come an executive made up of five or seven high-ranking officials who would be in charge of the country's administration. The judiciary would remain in the old Court of Catalonia, which would be re-established. The sole official status of the Catalan language, as well as the condition of the Catalan language as a compulsory clause for the exercise of public functions, were also considered. They also established the creation of a corps of volunteers for the formation of an army. The territorial organisation was divided into comarques and municipalities, elements that clearly contradicted a Spanish state that was at that time centralist and uniformising.\nAccording to historians José Luis de la Granja, Justo Beramendi and Pere Anguera, \"the Bases are an autonomist project, in no way pro-independence, of a traditional and corporatist nature. Structured in seventeen articles, they advocate the possibility of modernising civil law, the exclusive official status of Catalan, the reservation of public posts, including military posts, the comarca as the basic administrative entity, exclusive internal sovereignty, corporately elected courts, a higher court of last resort, the extension of municipal powers, voluntary military service, a body of public order and its own currency, and education sensitive to Catalan specificity\".\n\n\n=== Original text ===\n\nCentral power.\nBase 1.ª. Its powers. The central power shall be responsible for\na) International relations.\nb) The army at sea and on land, defence works and military education.\nc) Spain's economic relations with other countries and, consequently, the fixing of tariffs and customs duties.\nd) Construction and maintenance of roads, railways, canals and ports of general interest. The Regions concerned may freely agree on those of inter-regional interest, with the intervention of the Central Power only in the event of disagreement. Roads of regional interest shall be the exclusive competence of the Regions: The same criterion shall be followed for Postal and Telegraph services.\ne) The resolution of all inter-regional problems and conflicts.\nf) Formation of the annual expenditure budget, which, insofar as customs revenues are not sufficient, shall be distributed among the Regions in proportion to their wealth.\n\nRegional Power.\nBase 2. In the dogmatic part of the Catalan regional constitution, it shall maintain the expansive temperament of our ancient legislation, reforming, in order to bring them into line with new needs, the wise provisions it contains with regard to the rights and liberties of the Catalans.\nBase 3. The Catalan language shall be the only language which may be used officially in Catalonia and in the relations of this region with the central power.\nBase 4. Only Catalans, whether by birth or by naturalisation, may hold public office in Catalonia, including governmental and administrative posts which depend on the central government. Military posts involving jurisdiction shall also be held by Catalans.\nBase 5. The territorial division of the hierarchy of governmental, administrative and judicial powers shall be based on the natural region and the municipality.\nBase 6. Catalonia shall be the sole sovereign of its internal government, and therefore shall freely dictate its organic laws; it shall be responsible for its civil, criminal, mercantile, administrative and procedural legislation; the establishment and collection of taxes; the minting of coins; and it shall have all other powers inherent to sovereignty and which do not correspond to the central power in accordance with Base 1.\nBase 7. Regional legislative power shall be vested in the Catalan Cortes, which shall meet every year at a fixed time and in a different place. The Cortes shall be formed by suffrage of all heads of families, grouped by classes based on manual labour, ability or professional careers and on property, industry and commerce through the corresponding corporation organisation where possible.\nBase 8. The judiciary shall be organised by re-establishing the former Audiència de Catalunya; its President and Vice-President, appointed by the Cortes, shall constitute the supreme judicial authority of the region, and such lower courts as may be necessary shall be established, and all lawsuits and cases shall be decided within a specific period of time and in the final instance within Catalonia. Special jurisdictions such as the industrial and commercial courts shall be organised. Judicial officers shall be responsible.\nBase 9. Executive power shall be exercised by five or seven high-ranking officials appointed by the Cortes, who shall be in charge of the various branches of the regional administration.\nBase 10. The natural comarca shall be granted the widest possible range of administrative powers to govern its interests and satisfy its needs. A Council shall be organised in each district, appointed by the municipalities thereof, which shall exercise the aforementioned powers.\nBase 11. The municipality shall be granted all the powers it needs to look after its own exclusive interests. For the election of municipal offices, the same system of representation by class adopted for the formation of the Cortes shall be followed.\nBase 12. Catalonia shall contribute to the formation of the standing army of land and sea by means of volunteers or by means of a cash compensation agreed upon in advance as before 1845. The army corps corresponding to Catalonia shall be fixed and the volunteers to which it contributes shall belong. The reserve to which all boys of a given age will be subject shall be established with regional organisation.\nBase 13. The preservation of public order and internal security in Catalonia shall be entrusted to the Sometent, and for permanent active service a corps similar to that of the Mossos d'Esquadra or the Guardia Civil shall be created. All these forces shall depend solely on the regional power.\nBase 14. In the minting of currency, Catalonia shall be subject to the unitary rates agreed upon by the Regions and the international treaties of Monetary Union, and Catalan currency, like that of the other Regions, shall be compulsory throughout Spain.\nBase 15. Public education in its different grades and branches shall be organised in a manner appropriate to the needs and character of the civilisation of Catalonia. Teaching plans shall be based on the principle of dividing and specialising courses of study, avoiding encyclopaedic teaching.\nBase 16. The Catalan Constitution and the rights of the Catalans shall be under the safeguard of the Catalan executive power and any citizen shall be able to sue before the courts any civil servants who infringe them.\nManresa, 27th March 1892.

        "content": "New York Loose emerged as the brainchild of Brijitte West, a female guitarist and songwriter deeply influenced by the Rock music and Glam rock genres of the 1970s. Amidst a male-dominated music scene, Brijitte faced challenges in fostering strong loyalty among her bandmates, leading to frequent lineup changes. However, Danny Nordahl remained a consistent member throughout the majority of the band's career. Despite being the frontwoman and primary songwriter, Brijitte made the unconventional decision to name the band NY Loose, drawing inspiration from Iggy and The Stooges' song \"Loose\" and her affection for her beloved city.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the mid-90s, NY Loose had ascended to the upper echelons of New York City's rock culture, gracing iconic venues like CBGB. Their reputation spread rapidly as they embarked on self-managed tours, supporting a series of self-released singles and their first major EP, \"Loosen Up,\" featuring a provocative cover image of Brijitte in a moment of sonic ecstasy.\nThe band's dynamic performances and Brijitte West's presence positioned them as rising stars in the 90s rock scene, garnering attention even before the digital age. They embarked on extensive tours across the eastern seaboard, the southern United States, and England, earning acclaim from influential British music publications like NME and Melody Maker.\nUpon their return to the States in 1997, NY Loose attracted the interest of major record labels, leading to a showcase tour in Los Angeles' legendary clubs. However, a misguided decision to sign with the wrong label, influenced by their manager Andy Gould, and Hollywood Records' failure to grasp Brijitte's artistic vision, resulted in their debut major release, \"Year of the Rat\" (1998), struggling to gain traction.\nNY Loose’s most popular song was \"Pretty Suicide\" from the classic NY Loose album \"Year of the Rat.\"\nIn 1996, \"Spit\" appeared on the soundtrack for \"The Crow: City of Angels\" as well as on the 7\" split vinyl together with the Hole (band) (gruppo musicale)'s Gold Dust Woman (Hole Single).\nNY Loose covered the song Sunday Morning.\nDespite its early problems, \"Year of the Rat\" has afterwards achieved cult status and is now revered by contemporary rock influencers. The band's vinyl releases have become highly sought-after collectibles. \nUnfortunately, NY Loose disbanded shortly after parting ways with Hollywood Records in 1998.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLoosen Up!

        "content": "The Municipal Salon of Fine Arts of Belo Horizonte (SMBA-BH) or Capital Art Salon was an art salon established in 1937 that lasted throughout the 20th century under various names. National Salon of Contemporary Art and National Salon of Art of the Belo Horizonte City Hall are some of them.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nThe Municipal Salons of Fine Arts of the Belo Horizonte City Hall – SMBA-BH – were important in consolidating art in the capital of Minas Gerais, being responsible for constituting a large part of the collection of the Pampulha Art Museum, the most representative institution of modern and contemporary art in Belo Horizonte.\nOver the years, the Salon took on two forms. Until the 1970s, it was a traditional salon: artists submitted their works, which were then evaluated and awarded by a jury. With the advent of the 1970s, the salon took the form of a large collective exhibition, in which curators and critics worked together around a common thematic axis. The salon had renowned jurors such as Mário Pedrosa, Frederico Morais, Walter Zanini, Jayme Maurício, among others.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1936, artists from Minas Gerais shocked their quiet capital with the controversial Salão do Bar Brasil. On that occasion, modernist painters, illustrators, and sculptors held an exhibition in a Bar in the basement of the Cine Brasil Building, located at Praça Sete. Among other things, their goal was to protest the lack of spaces designated for the artistic class in Belo Horizonte, especially those with a modernist slant. At the time, it's worth remembering, the Belo Horizonte environment was dominated by Aníbal Mattos and his academic and conservative artistic practices.\nIn 1937, the first City Hall Salon was created to meet the demands of the time. The initial committee included Aníbal Mattos, along with Jeanne Louise Milde and João Boutshauser. The idea was that the salon could be a place of reconciliation and fellowship and that it would serve both modern and academic artists \nIn 1938, the II Capital Art Salon featured Milde as a juror. The salon unfolded into a meeting of artists at the Petrópolis Farm, owned by her, located in Santa Luzia. The meeting was attended by artists Renato de Lima, Delpino Júnior, Delio Del Pino, Aurélia Rubião, Vicente Guimarães, Genesco Murta, Alfredo Bastos and Maria Aurélia Bastos, Bracher Altavilla, Baron von Smigay, and J. Carlos Lisboa. The goal was to create a large artistic movement that reconciled trends, but the project never took off. Aurélia Rubião was one of the few artists linked to the first group who came to relate to the modernists and incorporate their influence into her paintings.\nIn 1957, the Salon was transferred to the Pampulha Museum; in 1969, the cycle of municipal salons ended, and the National Salons of Contemporary Art began. In 1971, with the depletion caused by the dictatorship, the salon changed format, as mentioned at the beginning of the entry, and was renamed the National Salon of Art of the Belo Horizonte City Hall.\n\n\n== References ==",

It determined the champion of the 1981–82 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters and the Cheyney State Wolves. The game was played on March 28, 1982, at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia. No. 1 Louisiana Tech defeated No. 2 Cheyney State 76–62 to capture the inaugural NCAA national championship.\nTo date, Cheyney State is the only HBCU to reach the NCAA women's Final Four and play for an NCAA championship.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\n\n=== Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters ===\n\nThe Lady Techsters, represented the Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana, were led by head coach Sonja Hogg in her 8th season at the school. After winning the AIAW tournament championship the year prior, the Lady Techsters opened the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, a spot they would not relinquish. The team won their first 20 games of the season and extended their overall win streak to 54 games before losing at No. 7 Old Dominion.\nIn the inaugural NCAA tournament, Louisiana Tech defeated Tennessee Tech, Arizona State, and Kentucky to reach the Final Four.

The Wolves defeated No. 3 Maryland, 76–66, to extend their winning streak to 23 games and set up the championship game matchup with Louisiana Tech.\n\n\n== Starting lineups ==\n\n\n== Game summary ==\nEarly in the game, Cheyney State played multiple zone defenses to confuse Louisiana Tech. The Wolves, who scored on 8 of their first 11 possessions, took a 16–8 lead after eight minutes. In need of a spark, Louisiana Tech employed a full court man-to-man press defense and substituted Debra Rodman into the game. The Lady Techsters regained the lead at 24–22 after a basket by Kim Mulkey and outscored Cheyney State 20–4 to close out the first half as Valerie Walker and Debra Walker had to sit with three fouls each.\nCheyney drew to within 8 points after a 16–10 run brought the score to 50–42 with 11:39 remaining. That's as close as the game would get down the stretch and Louisiana Tech took home the victory, 76–62.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe game was broadcast on CBS.\n\n\n== References ==",
