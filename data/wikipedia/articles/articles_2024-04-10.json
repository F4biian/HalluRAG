        "content": "General elections were held in Kuwait on 24 December 1938.\n\n\n== Background ==\nUnofficial elections had taken place in June 1938, electing 14 members of a council that Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah subsequently recognised as the Legislative Council in July. However, tensions between the council and the sheikh and British political agent soon came to a head, with the sheikh unhappy about the council dismissing his chief secretary and the British unhappy with the council attempting to take control of revenue from oil. The sheikh dissolved the council on 21 December and called fresh elections.\nThe council was expanded from 14 to 20 members, with the number of eligible voters was extended from 150 to 400.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThirteen of the fourteen members elected in June were re-elected, with only Youssef Marzouq Al-Marzouq not returning to the new council.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBefore its first sitting the sheikh presented council members with a new constitution that turned the council from an executive body to an advisory one, and allowed him to veto council decisions. However, the council refused to approve it. As a result, the sheikh dissolved the council on 7 March 1939 with the intention of replacing it with a fully appointed one.\nOn 9 March Muhammad bin Munais made a public speech attacking the sheikh and handed out anti-government leaflets. His arrest the following day led to an altercation when former council member Youssef Al-Marzouq attempted to intervene. During the incident, Muhammad Al-Qitami, a supporter of the council, fired at the police, while Al-Marzouq took out his handgun. The police returned fire, wounding both Al-Marzouq and Al-Qitami, with Al-Qitami later dying of his wounds. Munais was subsequently executed for treason. On 11 March five former members of the council were arrested, with a new jail having to be built to house the unprecedented number of prisoners.\nOn 12 March the sheikh appointed 14 members to a new advisory council, which functioned until July 1940 but then ceased meeting.\n\n\n== References ==",

The contest consisted of fourteen finalists who were determined through audition rounds and the final contest happened on February 24, 2019, at Empire Hotel in Subang Jaya, where a 21-year-old university student from Shah Alam, Haaraneei Muthu Kumar, was named the first Miss Grand Selangor.\nThe competition license was transferred to another organizer, Kingsley Tham, the following year.

They also differ from oral folktakes, which can be characterized as \"simple and anonymous\", and exist in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to oral tradition.\nOne of the earliest stories of this type is that of Cupid and Psyche,  a story originally from Metamorphoses (also called The Golden Ass), written in the 2nd century AD by  Apuleius.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFairytale fantasy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "content": "Souleymane Keïta was a Senegalese jihadist and the founder of the short-lived Khalid ibn al-Walid Battalion of Katiba Macina.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKeïta was born in 1959 or 1968 near Kaolack, Senegal, although other sources state he was born in Kangaba, Mali, near the Guinean border. He was born to a large Malinke family from Guinea. Keïta attended a madrasa during his childhood and traveled to Egypt for religious studies, along with receiving military training there. During his time in Egypt, he also made several trips to Saudi Arabia. In the mid-2000's, Keïta met Iyad Ag Ghaly at the Markaze mosque in Bamako, run by the Tablighi Jamaat.\nKeïta joined Ghaly's Ansar Dine in 2012, fighting in the early stages of the Mali War. Malian security sources stated that Keïta would have served as a \"recruiting sergeant\" during this time. Keïta also fought against French and Malian forces at the Battle of Konna. After Operation Serval, Keïta returned to southern Mali and founded the Khalid ibn al-Walid Battalion, also known as Ansar Dine Sud. His battalion had fighters from southern Mali, along with jihadists from Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Keïta commanded around 200 fighters, and was heavily involved with Amadou Koufa's Katiba Macina.\nAt the start of 2015, Keïta established a base in Samarco, on the Malian-Ivorian border. This base was ultimately destroyed by the Malian army, and the battalion's weapons were seized. He then established another base in the Sama Forest of Sikasso Region, on the Malian-Ivorian border. On June 10, 2016, the Khalid ibn al-Walid battalion briefly occupied the town of Misséni and then the town of Fakola on June 28. The Malian army attacked the battalion's base in the Sama Forest on July 16, destroying it.\nFollowing the battle of the Sama Forest, Keïta fled to Guinea, and then moved between Guinea, Sierra Leone, and The Gambia. Keïta's son-in-law and the second-in-command of the battalion, Amadou Niangadou or Djogormé, was arrested in Ivory Coast and transferred to Mali on August 19 along with six of his men. At the start of 2016, Keïta returned to Mali and hid in the Wagadou Forest along the Mauritanian border with the help of Katiba Macina. On March 29, 2016, while attempting to flee to Adrar des Ifoghas to meet up with Ghaly, Keïta was apprehended by the Malian army near Sokolo and transferred to Bamako.\nAfter a four-hour trial, Keïta was sentenced to death by a Malian court on November 13, 2020. He stated that \"I regret nothing because our fight is against the secularism of the Malian state. If I had the chance, I would do it again.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Whitehaven Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station, located in the town of Whitehaven, Cumberland, Cumbria.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here in 1804. The station was transferred to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1865.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt a meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Town and Harbour of Whitehaven, on 30 September 1803, a decision was made to order for Whitehaven, the largest size of lifeboat available, from pioneering lifeboat builder Henry Greathead of South Shields. According to Greathead's documents, the 1½ ton (unnamed) boat for Whitehaven was a 12-oar 28-foot lifeboat, costing £149.\nAfter a 4-day trip overland from South Shields, the boat arrived in Whitehaven on 10 January 1804\nIt would be nearly 10 years until the boat was needed, when the vessel Brothers of Workington was washed ashore on 17 November 1813, at the entrance to the harbour. Even then, the lifeboat was not immediately available, its storage location at the time is unknown, and so the harbour boat with a crew of five, was first dispatched to the vessel. Sadly, one of those five crew, Thomas Farrell, was lost overboard. At a review following this incident by the harbour trustees in March 1814, a plan was made to provide a new lifeboat house on the New Quay.\nIn July 1865, it would appear that the transfer of the provision of a lifeboat at Whitehaven to the RNLI, was at the instigation of the RNLI. Miss Elizabeth Leicester of London had approached the RNLI with an offer to fund a lifeboat specifically for Whitehaven.\nA 33-foot 10-oar self-righting boat, Robert Whitworth, costing £255 and built in 1864 by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, had served at Tynemouth for one year, and had then been transferred to Bridlington. However, she was found too heavy for Bridlington due to the soft sand, and it was this boat that was then placed at Whitehaven. A new boat house was constructed north of the North Pier, on land that is now Whitehaven Marina Yard, funded by the Harbour Commissioners. The boat arrived on 29 March 1866, and was renamed Elizabeth.\nWhitehaven got another boat in 1875, officially placed at Whitehaven No.2 station. This was actually Seascale Lifeboat Station, some 13 miles down the coast, but with all the crew being Whitehaven men. The station was closed in 1895, the lifeboat having launching just four times in 20 years, and having carried out just one successful rescue of 3 men, in its first year.\nTwo more lifeboats were assigned to Whitehaven, the first in 1884 and then one in 1903. Both were named after Elizabeth Leicester.\nThe 1865 boathouse was demolished in 1909, with a new one constructed on the same site. In 1924, it was noted that there had been no service calls since February 1918, over six years. At a meeting of the RNLI Committee of Management on 18 Dec 1924, the decision was taken to close the station with immediate effect. Six Whitehaven lifeboats had been called upon 19 times, and saved 33 lives, plus the whole crew of the Thistle in 1819, whose numbers were not recorded\n\n\n== Whitehaven lifeboats ==\n\n\n=== Whitehaven ===\n\n\n=== Whitehaven No.2 Station ===\nPlease see Seascale Lifeboat Station\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRNLI station information",

        "content": "Montalbert (1795) is a novel by Charlotte Smith. The story is set in England and Italy in 1782 and 1783, with the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes playing a role in the narrative. The novel responds to Ann Radcliffe's famous Gothic novel A Sicilian Romance (1790), especially through its plot of a disenfranchised young woman seeking her lost mother.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nChronologically, the events of the novel begin with Rosalie Montalbert, who belongs to the English Catholic gentry. She falls in love with Ormsby, an impoverished Irishman and a distant relative; they have an affair. Ormsby disappears, apparently murdered by Rosalie's father (actually compelled by him to move to India), and Rosalie marries a man she does not love but whom her father approves of. She gives birth to an illegitimate daughter, also named Rosalie, whom she secretly gives to her Protestant friend Mrs. Lessington to raise.\nRosalie Lessington repeats her mother's misfortunes through an illicit affair with Harry Montalbert, who is unbeknownst to her a distant relation. They elope, but Montalbert refuses to tell his family, leaving Rosalie (the younger) alone with an infant in Messina while he visits his mother. Rosalie and the baby are endangered when an earthquake destroys their villa. When Montalbert returns to Messina, rather than seeking them he pursues revenge on a man whom he falsely suspects of conducting an affair with Rosalie. When Rosalie and Montalbert eventually reunite in England, he has her baby taken away because he considers her an adulteress, and she goes mad. Eventually, they reconcile for a happy ending.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMontalbert volume 1 at the Internet Archive\nMontalbert volume 2 at the Internet Archive\nMontalbert volume 3 at the Internet Archive",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The powers of the president of Turkey are primarily defined by the Constitution of Turkey. The status and powers of the president are laid out in Part 2, Chapter 2 of the Constitution, entitled \"Executive Power\". The President holds a pivotal position within the country's political framework, commanding a blend of ceremonial and executive powers that significantly influence the governance of the nation.\n\n\n== Constitutional framework ==\nThe powers and responsibilities vested in the President of Turkey are primarily delineated by the Constitution of Turkey. Enacted in 1982 following a period of military rule, the constitution sets forth the authority of the president within the framework of the Turkish Republic, establishing the parameters of their role and influence.\n\n\n== Executive Authority ==\n\n\n=== Appointment of Ministers ===\nOne of the key executive prerogatives of the President is the appointment of ministers to the Cabinet. Historically, this process operated through the recommendation of the Prime Minister. However, constitutional reforms in 2017 abolished the position of Prime Minister, thereby granting the President direct authority to appoint ministers, consolidating the executive branch.\n\n\n=== Executive decree ===\nThe President possesses the authority to issue executive orders, which carry the weight of law, particularly in matters concerning executive functions and the implementation of legislation. These orders serve as a mechanism for the President to enact policy decisions swiftly, subject to subsequent judicial scrutiny to ensure conformity with constitutional principles and existing legal frameworks.\n\n\n=== Commander-in-chief ===\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the Turkish Armed Forces and may exercise supreme operational command and control over them. The president has, in this capacity, plenary power to launch, direct and supervise military operations, order or authorize the deployment of troops and form military policy with the Ministry of National Defense and the National Security Council. However, the constitutional ability to declare war is vested only in Parliament.\n\n\n=== Declaration of state of emergency ===\nIn times of national crisis or emergency, the President holds the power to declare a state of emergency, either nationwide or in specific regions of the country. Such declarations confer upon the President expanded executive powers, including the ability to issue decrees with the force of law, enabling decisive action to address urgent challenges and maintain public order. The declariation is subject to the approval of the Parliament (in a state of emergency, the presidential decree requires parliamentary approval).\n\n\n== Powers related to legislation ==\n\n\n=== Veto authority ===\nThe President possesses the prerogative to veto legislation passed by the Grand National Assembly, Turkey's unicameral legislature. While the veto serves as a potent check on legislative initiatives, it is subject to potential override by a simple majority vote in the Assembly, underscoring the delicate balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\n=== Legislative initiative ===\nAlthough the primary responsibility for initiating legislation lies with the Grand National Assembly, the President retains the right to propose legislation to the Assembly, thereby exerting influence over the legislative agenda and shaping the direction of policy initiatives.\n\n\n== Diplomatic Role ==\n\n\n=== Representation in Foreign Affairs ===\nAs the head of state, the President of Turkey assumes a significant role in representing the country's interests on the international stage. They have the authority to negotiate and sign treaties on behalf of Turkey, subject to subsequent ratification by the Assembly, thus playing a pivotal role in shaping the nation's foreign policy agenda.\n\n\n=== International engagement ===\nThe President engages in diplomatic initiatives, forging relationships with foreign leaders and participating in international forums and summits, thereby advancing Turkey's diplomatic objectives and fostering cooperation on global issues of mutual concern. The president can also ratify and promulgate international treaties.\n\n\n== Judicial appointments ==\nThe President plays an important role in the appointment of high-ranking judicial officials. The president appoints twelve of the fifteen members of the Constitutional Court, one-fourth of the members of the Council of State, the Chief Public Prosecutor and the Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation and four out of 13 members of the Council of Judges and Prosecutors. These appointments have significant implications for the functioning of the judiciary and the protection of the rule of law within the country.\n\n\n== Constraints and oversight ==\nDespite the considerable powers vested in the President, the Turkish political system incorporates mechanisms to ensure accountability and prevent the abuse of authority. The principle of checks and balances underscores the role of other branches of government, including the judiciary and the legislature, in providing oversight and maintaining the integrity of democratic governance. A simple majority in the parliament can call for new presidential elections.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPowers of the president of the United States\nPowers of the prime minister of the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nÇelik Ulusoy, Demet. \"Presidential Powers: New Governmental Design in Turkey\".

        "content": "Bransdale Mill is a historic building in Bransdale, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere has been a watermill on Hodge Beck since the Mediaeval period.  The current mill was constructed in the 18th century, to grind corn.  It was extended in 1817, and partly rebuilt in 1842, both by William Strickland.  The work included heightening the building to two storeys.  In 1917, the mill ceased grinding corn, instead grinding grist.  Milling finally ended in 1942, following a major flood.  It was grade II listed in 1987, at which time it was being restored by the National Trust.  It has since operated as a bunkhouse.\nThe mill is built of sandstone, and has pantile roofs with coped gables.  The main block has two storeys and an attic, and to the left is an extension with a single storey and an attic.  In the main block are two round-arched doorways with voussoirs, sash windows, and two small openings in the attic.  The lintel of the upper floor window has an inscription.  In the extension are a doorway, a sash window and two shuttered openings, and in the gable end is a datestone.  The overshot water wheel with iron buckets survives, as do three sets of millstones.  Inside, there is a main shaft and a sack hoist shaft, and a wooden framework of an oat crushing mill.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bransdale\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Batrachospermum is a genus of red algae from the family Batrachospermaceae. Due to its complex biological life cycle, descriptions of the taxon typically focus on gametophytes, while sporophytes, i.e., carposporophytes, are filamentous structures growing on the gametophyte, on which they depend. Independently living sporophytes have sometimes been described as separate species within the genus Chantransia. Additionally, differences may occur in the descriptions of the genus due to variations in taxonomic approaches, as new taxonomic techniques, as with other algae, result in changes in the assignment of individual species to the genus Batrachospermum. The genus is cosmopolitan, and its representatives are found in freshwater environments, mainly rivers, and less frequently in standing waters. These plants have thalli in the form of gelatinous-coated filaments.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe etymology of the scientific name (Greek: βάτραχος – frog, σπέρμα – seed) refers to its gelatinous appearance resembling frog spawn. The Polish name, żabirośl (frogseed) also allude to this appearance.\n\n\n== Systematics and variability ==\nThe genus Batrachospermum was established by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth at the end of the 18th century, described in his work Bemerkungen über das Studium der cryptogamischen Wassergewächse (Remarks on the study of cryptogamic aquatic plants). Previously, botanists described these algae as species belonging to the genera Conferva (now not recognized, with its representatives mainly classified under the genus Cladophora) – Conferva gelatinosa or Conferva nodosa (Carl Linnaeus), or Charales – Chara batrachosperma (Friedrich Wilhelm Weiss). Initially, Roth used the name Chara gelatinosa. The binomial nomenclature were first used in 1801 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who distinguished three species: B. gelatinosum, B. simplex, and B. nigricans. Thus, B. gelatinosum became the type species (holotype) of its genus, with the basionym being Conferva gelatinosa (L. 1753: 1166).\nIn older systems (e.g., Engler system), the genera Batrachospermum and Chantransia were classified under the family Helminthocladiaceae in the order Nemalionales. Currently, the family Batrachospermaceae and the order Batrachospermales are recognized. According to some systematic proposals, this order is monotypic, and families distinguished within it, such as Lemaneaceae, should be synonymized with Batrachospermaceae.\nDepending on the systematic approach, there are from several dozen to several hundred species within the genus. The development of molecular phylogenetics has challenged the traditional morphology and anatomy-based taxonomy. According to these studies, the genus Batrachospermum is paraphyletic – nested within its clade are genera such as Lemanea, Nothocladus, Paralemanea, Petrohua, Psilosiphon, Sirodotia, and Tuomeya. In order to maintain the genus as a monophyletic taxon in a broad sense, all the above-mentioned genera are included in Batrachospermum, or in a narrow sense, only the type species, B. gelatinosum, is included, with its recognized form (sometimes elevated to the species rank) B. gelatinosum f. spermatoinvolucrum (M.L.Vis & R.G.Sheath). In the narrow sense, the previously distinguished sections are elevated to the rank of genera, for example, the Hybrida section (previously distinguished as the Contorta section) is raised to the genus Kumanoa. According to one proposal, the paraphyletic genus Batrachospermum can be divided into the following sections:\n\nAcarposporophytum (Batrachospermum brasiliense)\nAristata (Batrachospermum cayennense)\nBatrachospermum (Batrachospermum gelatinosum)\nGonimopropagulum (Batrachospermum breutelli)\nHelminthoidea (Batrachospermum arcuatum, Batrachospermum boryanum, Batrachospermum confusum, Batrachospermum heterocorticum, Batrachospermum involutum)\nMacrospora (Batrachospermum macrosporum)\nSetacea (Batrachospermum atrum, Batrachospermum puiggarianum)\nTurfosa (Batrachospermum turfosum)\nVirescentia (Batrachospermum elegans, Batrachospermum helminthosum)\nAdditionally, there is a provisionally designated Australasian group, which is paraphyletic and from which the genera Nothocladus and Petrohua, as well as the Setacea section (Batrachospermum antipodites, Batrachospermum campyloclonum, Batrachospermum discors, Batrachospermum kraftii, Batrachospermum pseudogelatinosum, Batrachospermum theaquum, Batrachospermum wattsii), originate.\nAfter the separation of the genus Kumanoa, the following species formerly classified under Batrachospermum are transferred to this genus: B. australicum (Kumanoa australica), B. breviarticulatum (Kumanoa breviarticulata), B. cipoense (Kumanoa cipoensis), B. deminutum (Kumanoa deminuta), B. equisetoideum (Kumanoa equisetoidea), B. globosporum (Kumanoa globospora), B. gracillimum (Kumanoa gracillima), B. intortum (Kumanoa intorta), B. louisianae (Kumanoa louisianae), B. nodiflorum (Kumanoa nodiflora), B. procarpum (Kumanoa procarpa), B. spermatiophorum (Kumanoa spermatiophora), B. virgatodecaisneanum (Kumanoa virgatodecaisneana), B. vittatum (Kumanoa vittata).\nAfter considering almost all of these changes, in the AlgaeBase system, in addition to those mentioned above, the following species were verified as of Autumn 2011 (others appearing in publications are either considered synonyms of others or not yet verified):\n\nOne of the more commonly reported species in publications, B. moniliforme, is considered a synonym of B. gelatinosum in this system.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\n=== Habit ===\nThe thallus is filamentous, covered with a slippery, gelatinous sheath, with mucilage primarily composed of oligosaccharides. The degree of gelatinosity of the thallus varies between species. Species occurring in swifter currents typically have a more compact form, while those in slower currents have a looser form.\nThe gametophyte thallus is filamentous, up to 40 cm long (usually shorter in many species), typically branching monopodially to dichotomy. Downward-growing filaments form the covering cortex around the central filament, sometimes resembling rhizoids in the lower part. Nodes occur between the cells of the main filament, from which lateral filaments grow radially. From the cortex filaments situated on the internodes, intercortical filaments also arise. Lateral cortical filaments are more branched and longer than intercortical ones. Younger thalli usually form broader branches (up to 350 μm wide) than older ones (100–200 μm).\nThe color varies, ranging from brownish, olive, purple, gray to bluish-green.\nThe sporophyte stage is crustose, consisting of large basal cells from which poorly branched filaments grow upwards.\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\nThe cells of the main filament are elongated (150–200 μm) in shape of a cylinder. The cells of the cortical filaments are lens-shaped, ellipsoidal, up to 30 μm in length. Each cell contains several ribbon-shaped chloroplasts without pyrenoids. The chloroplasts contain a single fragmented thylakoid. Among the metabolites, in addition to substances typical for all red algae (such as red algal starch), trehalose is present. The number of chromosomes (n) varies, depending on the species, ranging from 2 to 22.\n\n\n=== Structures for propagation ===\nSeveral species produce monospores, but usually carpospores are formed. Spermatangia (male gametangia) are spherical (4–8 µm in diameter) and colorless, usually clustered at the end of filaments, sometimes also on branches carrying carpogonia. Male gametes are non-motile gametangia. Female gametes – carpogonia – are essentially equivalent to oogonia. The hair of the carpogonium is club-shaped. Carposporophytes are roughly spherical, formed by gonimoblasts, with carposporangia at the tips (lacking cystocarp). In Batrachospermum breutelli, the carposporophyte produces multicellular diaspores that detach. Spores do not have any endosporic features.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn defining environmental requirements, taxonomic controversies pose a certain difficulty. It happens that a particular species is considered by ecologists as an indicator of a certain environmental condition, while another species is considered an indicator of a different condition. However, both of these species may turn out to be synonymous to each other as a result of molecular studies.\n\n\n=== Geographical distribution ===\nThe genus is freshwater and cosmopolitan. Since red algae are mostly found in saltwater environments, in some regions, representatives of Batrachospermum are the most common riverine red algae. This is the case with Batrachospermum gelatinosum, which was found in 13% of samples collected from North American streams. In the streams of the upper São Francisco basin in Brazil, various species of Batrachospermum, especially in the thallus stage, are one of the most common taxonomic groups of macroalgae. In Poland, occurrences are scattered throughout the country, with more frequent sightings in the Pomerania region and in the Silesian-Lesser Poland Uplands.\nSome species, such as B. gelatinosum, are found on all continents (except Antarctica), while others are endemic (e.g., Batrachospermum spermatiophorum known only from one stream on Maui Island), although according to some proposals, it may be transferred to the genus Kumanoa.\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\nSpecies of Batrachospermum inhabit the benthos of moderately to swiftly flowing waters (average flow velocity – 19 cm/s) with a substrate of gravelly or stony bottoms, and even in springs. They are rarely found in standing waters. The substrate to which they are attached can vary from stones to macrophytes, especially among different species. Representatives are often rheophiles or rheobionts and live in waters with a wide range of current velocities, but with averages exceeding 40 cm/s (e.g., Batrachospermum boryanum), or even 50 cm/s (B. keratophytum, which also occurs in ponds). Due to the high oxygenation typical of such conditions, they exhibit characteristics of organisms highly tolerant to oxygen, and a decrease in oxygen concentration results in a decrease in respiratory rate. These conditions favor rapid water self-purification, especially from organic pollutants, so these species are recognized as saprobic systems (B. vagum) or saproxenes (B. moniliforme, also known as B. gelatinosum), although the latter species may also indicate γ-mesosaprobic waters. They mainly occur in waters with low mineral content. Unlike most algae, they do not assimilate carbon bound in carbonate ions, so they require dissolved CO2. As a result, despite their ability to occur in waters with different pH levels, they are more common in acidic waters, where such a form of inorganic carbon predominates. Some representatives (B. keratophytum, B. vagum – both species sometimes considered synonyms of B. turfosum) occur in dystrophic waters, with low transparency, but they can also occur in swiftly flowing waters. Even then, however, they are more common in streams with water rich in humic compounds – more acidic and darker than average. Also, representatives of some other species have a wide range of tolerance to sunlight, pH, and other parameters. This applies especially to B. gelatinosum, the only representative of the genus occurring up to the tundra zone, and described under synonymous names (B. delicatulum) also from tropical zones. This species is sometimes described as typical for both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters.\nThallus and gametophyte stages can occur in different habitat conditions. It happens that only one of these generations is observed in certain regions.\n\n\n=== Interspecies interactions ===\nThe thalli of Batrachospermum are a food source for aquatic invertebrates, including amphipods, snails, and aquatic insect larvae. In some studies, they have been found in the gut content of almost half of the examined individuals.\nThe silk-like secretions that bind the threads of Batrachospermum are used to build shelters by some chironomidic larvae. Shelters made from different species of Batrachospermum have slightly different structures.\nThe gelatinous sheath serves as a habitat for periphytic algae, such as Chrysodesmis gloeophila. Some algae, such as the red algae Balbiania and Sirodotia, can also grow directly on the gelatinous thalli of Batrachospermum.\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe Batrachospermum, like other red algae, undergoes an alternation of generations. The life cycle involves one haploid generation of gametophyte (typically described as the actual individual of Batrachospermum) and two diploid generations of sporophytes – carposporophyte and Chantransia (or pseudochantransia).\nThe Chantransia stage is annual. Chantransia can produce monospores or, through meiotic division, produce gametophyte thalli growing on it, without releasing tetraspores. Gametophytes live for a short period – from late autumn to early spring in tropical regions or slightly longer in temperate zones. However, in certain conditions, they can also be perennial. The production of gametophytes may be associated with photoperiodism. Gametophytes produce male gametes – spermatozoids and female gametes – carpogonia (which are essentially identical to oogonia). Some species (e.g., Batrachospermum boryanum) are dioecious, while others are monoicous. In some species (e.g., B. delicatulum, also known as B. gelatinosum), both monoicious and dioecious individuals occur. Both types of gametes are non-motile – spermatozoids are released into the water and carried by its movement, while carpogonia remain on the parent plant, germinating into carposporophytes after fertilization. Carposporophytes, originating from the zygote, are diploids. Due to their inconspicuous appearance and occurrence on gametophytes, they were once considered parasites. However, sometimes they detach from the gametophyte, serving as diaspores. Carposporophytes produce carpospores released into the water, from which the Chantransia stage germinates. An exception is Batrachospermum brasiliense, in which there is no carposporophyte, and the Chantransia stage grows directly from the fertilized carpogonium. Since the gametophyte grows on the Chantransia, the carposporophyte on the gametophyte, and the carpospores can germinate on the parent plant, their common body can be considered a kind of chimera.\nFor many years, it was believed that the only diploid stage in the development of Batrachospermum is the zygote, which immediately undergoes meiosis, making the carposporophyte haplont. Such information is still presented in relatively modern studies, despite the fact that since the mid-20th century, it has been discovered that successive species representing this life cycle model (supposedly represented by the genus Nemalion) actually have a model similar to most other red algae (typified by Polysiphonia). Additional misunderstandings arose from the fact that after meiosis in Chantransia (or pseudochantransia), only one cell (meiospore) gives rise to a new individual, while the rest degenerate, which is unusual in algae. Moreover, the meiospore is not released but germinates on the parent plant. It was only in the late 1960s and early 1970s that it was proven that the nuclei of Batrachospermum and Lemanea gametophytes contain half of the DNA of the nuclei of individuals from the supposed genus Pesudochantransia.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nUnlike some marine red algae, Batrachospermum is not used in cooking. There are few reports of the anti-inflammatory properties of B. atrum used in folk medicine at the foothills of the Himalayas (Arunachal Pradesh).\nDue to its environmental requirements, representatives of this genus found in Poland are considered when determining the River Macrophyte Index, with values of W=6 (indicating a preference for mesotrophic waters) and L=2 (indicating an average range of ecological tolerance).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cornelia Keeble Ewing (March 6, 1898 – December 20, 1973) was an American socialite, clubwoman, and philanthropist who founded the Junior League of Nashville, Tennessee in 1922. She served as president of the Junior League of Nashville from 1922 to 1924 and, as president, she established The Junior League Home for Crippled Children (now the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt).\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nEwing was born Cornelia Keeble on March 6, 1898, in Nashville, Tennessee to John Bell Keeble, an attorney who served as Dean of Vanderbilt University Law School, and \tEmmie Frazer. She had one sister and four brothers, including the architect Edwin A. Keeble. Ewing was the granddaughter of Edwin Augustus Keeble, who served as the mayor of Murfreesboro and as a member of the Confederate States Congress. She was a great-granddaughter of Senator John Bell, who served as U.S. Speaker of the House and Secretary of War, and a great-grandniece of Congressman David W. Dickinson.\n\n\n== Junior League ==\nInspired by the activist Mary Harriman, Ewing founded the Nashville chapter of the Junior League, a women's volunteer organization, in 1922. The chapter was admitted into the Association of Junior Leagues that same year. It was the thirtieth chapter admitted. There were forty-six other charter members of her chapter. Ewing is reported to have said, \"Nashville could use an equivalent dose of reality. They, too, could leave their antebellum homes and wisteria-draped patios and go forth to campaign for the greater good.\"She served as the chapter's first president and hosted meetings at her home on 2114 West End Avenue. Her cabinet included Evelyn Douglas as vice president, Elizabeth Kirkland as recording secretary, Jeanette Sloan as corresponding secretary, and Mrs. Alec Stevenson as treasurer. Ewing served two terms as president of the Nashville Junior League, from 1922 to 1923 and from 1923 to 1924. She was succeeded by Frances Marion Dudley Brown.In 1923, under her presidency, the Nashville League founded The Junior League Home for Crippled Children. They also established the Mental Health Guidance Center and the Nashville Children's Theatre.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe married the lawyer Andrew Ewing on June 14, 1930. They had two children, Elizabeth and Andrew. Her husband was the associate counsel of the Home Owners Loan Corporation in 1933 and, during World War II, served as Chairman of the Davidson County Rationing Board. She died in 1973 and was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miss Grand Kuala Lumpur is a Malaysian state-level beauty pageant which selects representatives from Kuala Lumpur for the Miss Grand Malaysia national competition, founded in 2017 by a Kuala Lumpur-based entrepreneur, Meris Waldorf of Me Rich Sdn Bhd.\nSince the first competition in the Miss Grand Malaysia pageant, Kuala Lumpur's representatives have never won the competition three times but were named runners-up in 2017 and 2018, as well as won the supplemental title of Miss Intercontinental Malaysia in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter acquiring the license of Miss Grand Malaysia in 2017, Jude Benjamin Lisa began franchising the state competitions to individual organizers, who would name the state representatives to compete in the national pageant, the license for Kuala Lumpur was granted to a Kuala Lumpur-based entrepreneur, Meris Waldorf of Me Rich Sdn Bhd, who then organized the first contest of Miss Grand Kuala Lumpur on July 15, 2017, at the Panggung Anniversari, Kuala Lumpur, in which a 19-year-old dentistry student, Parveen Sidhu, was named the first Miss Grand Kuala Lumpur.\nThe competition license was transferred to Jacqueline Liwanag Malabuyoc and Rosalinda Talip in 2018 and 2020, respectively. It was halted in 2022 after the national license of Miss Grand Malaysia was transferred to Sean Wong of HyperLive Entertainment Pte. Ltd., and the state franchise has not been distributed since then.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Kuala Lumpur's annual editions since 2017.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of candidates who competed at the Miss Grand Malaysia pageant under the state organization of Miss Grand Kuala Lumpur.\n\nColor keys\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Malaysia at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Alfred Matthews was a football player who won the FA Cup with Blackburn Olympic in 1883.\n\n\n== Pre-football career ==\nIn common with most of the Olympic side, Matthews was from the local working-class; at the time he played for the club, he was a picture framer.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nThe first recorded appearance for Matthews in Olympic colours was as one of the two right-wingers in a defeat at Eagley in December 1879.\nMatthews properly broke into the team in the 1881–82 season, making his FA Cup debut in the club's first round defeat at Darwen that year.  He finished the season by picking up his first medal for Olympic, as a right-winger in the side which beat Blackburn Rovers 5–2 in the East Lancashire Charity Cup final in August, the tie delayed after Accrington withdrew from the semi-final in a huff after Olympic successfully protested the Owd Reds' fielding of an ineligible player.\nHis second season as a first choice player, 1882–83, was the Olympians' greatest season.  He scored his first goal in the Cup in the 8–1 win over Lower Darwen in the second round, and played a crucial part in one of the goals in the semi-final win over the Old Carthusians by barging goalkeeper Thompson out of the way of a Yates shot.  His and the Olympians' career reached a peak in the 1883 FA Cup final against the Old Etonians; Matthews scored the equalizer in the 67th minute thanks to a \"capital screw kick\", and also hit the post, as the Olympians secured the trophy with a 2–1 extra-time win.\nThe season ended in a disappointment as a weakened Olympic side lost to Rovers in the 1883 Lancashire Charity Cup final.  He also collected runners-up medals in the Lancashire Senior Cup in 1884 and 1885.\nThe Light Blues were left behind by the growing tendency towards professionalism, given its comparative lack of backing when compared to other Lancashire sides.  Matthews himself did not turn professional when the Football Association legalized it in 1885; Olympic registered him as an amateur.  Perhaps because of this, he was no longer a first choice for Olympic, and had made his last Cup appearance in the demolition of at Oswaldtwistle Rovers in the first round of the 1884–85 competition.\nNevertheless, he remained loyal to the side, his last recorded game coming in 1889.  He does not seem to have joined any other clubs afterwards.  He made one final appearance in Olympic colours, in a match for the benefit of former Olympic chairman John Dixon; he turned out for an \"old Olympian\" side against former Rovers players in March 1892, in front of nearly 4,000 at Ewood Park.\n\n\n== Post-football ==\nAfter his career ended, Matthews - considered \"the Adonis of the team\" - became a Church Army \"captain\" in London.  He died some time before 1939, as he was not one of the last three surviving Olympic Cup winners.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Nicholas' Church is the parish church of Bransdale, North Yorkshire, a village in England.\nThere was a chapel in Bransdale by the 13th century, probably connected with Keldholme Priory.  The current building dates from about 1800, and based on its style, Historic England attributes its design for John Smith of Farndale.  The building was reroofed in 1886, and extended in 1934.  It was grade II listed in 1987.\nThe church is constructed of stone and has a roof of stone flags, with a slate roof on the porch.  It consists of a nave and a chancel under a continuous roof, a south porch and a west tower.  The tower has a single stage, a louvred bell opening on the south side, a raised parapet band, and coped battlements.  The porch is gabled and has a round-arched opening.  The windows on the sides contain paired lights with pointed cusped heads, and the east window has a pointed head and three lights.  Inside, there is a sedilia moved from elsewhere, a tub font, and a barrel-vaulted roof.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bransdale\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council election will take place on 2 May 2024 to elect members of Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council in Merseyside, England. This will be on the same day as other local elections across England, Liverpool's City Region mayoral election and Merseyside's Police and Crime Commissioner election.\nAs is typical for Sefton's local elections, twenty-two seats of the sixty-six total will be contested. The Labour party have controlled the council since the 2012 elections, currently with a comfortable working majority of 13. Shortly before the election, this was reduced from their majority of 18 they had had following the previous year's election; in early March Labour Councillor Trish Hardy resigned from her Litherland ward seat leaving a vacancy, and less than a month before polling day Councillors Natasha Carlin and Sean Halsall left Labour in protest of the party's policy direction and stance on the war in Gaza. \nThe majority of the seats contested are currently held by Labour, who will be defending fifteen of the twenty-two seats. The Liberal Democrats will defend three seats, and the Conservatives will defend two seats. The vacant Litherland seat will also be contested alongside two seats currently held by independent councillors.\nContesting all seats up for election will be Labour, and the Conservatives, while the Green Party are contesting every seat except 1 (Linacre), although as a result of administrative confusion some will have the description “Green Party” and the party’s logo (16 candidates) while others will have only the logo (5 candidates), the Liberal Democrats are contesting close to all seats, with candidates representing Reform UK, TUSC, Freedom Alliance, localist groups, standing a small number of candidates, and 2 independents.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\n7 March 2024: Labour councillor Trish Hardy resigns.\n8 April 2024: Natasha Carlin and Sean Halsall leave Labour to sit as independents over protest of Labour's direction and stance on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== Announced Candidates ==\nThe Statements of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, were released by Sefton Council on 8 April 2024 following the close of nominations. Sitting councillors standing for re-election are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n\n=== Ainsdale Ward ===\n\n\n=== Birkdale Ward ===\n\n\n=== Blundellsands Ward ===\n\n\n=== Cambridge Ward ===\n\n\n=== Church Ward ===\n\n\n=== Derby Ward ===\n\n\n=== Dukes Ward ===\n\n\n=== Ford Ward ===\n\n\n=== Harington Ward ===\n\n\n=== Kew Ward ===\n\n\n=== Linacre Ward ===\n\n\n=== Litherland Ward ===\n\n\n=== Manor Ward ===\n\n\n=== Meols Ward ===\n\n\n=== Molyneux Ward ===\n\n\n=== Netherton and Orrell Ward ===\n\n\n=== Norward Ward ===\n\n\n=== Park Ward ===\n\n\n=== Ravenmeols Ward ===\n\n\n=== St Oswald Ward ===\n\n\n=== Sudell Ward ===\n\n\n=== Victoria Ward ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 178th Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army in the Siberian Military District, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939, on the basis of the separate 386th Rifle Regiment. Following the German invasion it was moved west and concentrated west of Moscow as part of 24th Army in early July. Late that month the Army was assigned to Reserve Front. While this Army played the main role in the successful offensive at Yelnya, the 178th was held in reserve. In late August, in response to a German drive against 22nd Army on the right flank of Western Front, the division was moved by rail and truck northward to join 29th Army in the vicinity of Nelidovo, to cover the gap between that Army and the 22nd. When Army Group Center launched Operation Typhoon in early October the 29th Army was not directly affected, but soon had to fall back to the northeast under pressure from German 9th Army, giving up the town of Rzhev in the process. On October 17 the 29th Army became part of the new Kalinin Front, and later in the month the 178th was moved to 22nd Army. On January 15, 1942, the Army went over to the counteroffensive, and the 178th soon found itself fighting to regain territory around Rzhev that it had been forced from months before. In February, the division was reassigned to 30th Army, and it remained in that Army through the summer battles for the Rzhev salient. During Operation Mars, in November, it was in 39th Army, and managed to gain ground during this otherwise failed offensive.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe division was formed between August 18 and September 9, 1939, in the Altai region; the 386th Regiment was stationed at Slavgorod. Later the new regiments were stationed at Omsk and Tatarsk. Following an inspection in early 1941 it was rated as one of the best in the Siberian Military District. Its order of battle on June 22, 1941, was as follows (including later additions):\n\n386th Rifle Regiment\n693rd Rifle Regiment\n709th Rifle Regiment\n332nd Artillery Regiment\n432nd Howitzer Artillery Regiment (until September 27, 1941)\n213th Antitank Battalion (until September 27, 1941, then from February 10, 1942)\n239th Antiaircraft Battery (later 178th Antiaircraft Battalion) (until May 5, 1943)\n430th Mortar Battalion (from November 1, 1941, to October 10, 1942)\n467th Machinegun Battalion (from October 1, 1942, to May 5, 1943)\n139th Reconnaissance Company (later 139th Reconnaissance Battalion)\n211th Sapper Battalion\n227th Signal Battalion (later 579th Signal Company)\n218th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n156th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n93rd Motor Transport Company (later 225th Motor Transport Battalion)\n266th Field Bakery (later 138th Motorized Field Bakery)\n88th Divisional Veterinary Hospital\n484th Field Postal Station (later 227th)\n247th Field Office of the State Bank\nCol. Nikolai Ivanovich Starukhin transitioned from command of the 386th Regiment to command of the full division when it began forming. He would remain in this position until August 1, 1941. At the outbreak of war with Germany it was part of 53rd Rifle Corps, along with the 107th and 133rd Rifle Divisions. This Corps was assigned to 24th Army in the Reserve of the STAVKA High Command. The 178th began moving west from Siberia by rail in late June, and by the start of July was concentrating west of Moscow.\n\n\n== Battle of Smolensk ==\nOn July 1 the 24th Army was still officially a separate Army within the STAVKA Reserve, but by 10 days later it was part of the Group of STAVKA Reserve Armies, and 53rd Corps had gained the 248th Rifle Division. On July 30 the headquarters of Reserve Front was formed, to be located at Gzhatsk and with Army Gen. G. K. Zhukov appointed as commander. 24th Army, now with seven rifle divisions, a tank division, a motorized division, and an assortment of artillery assets, was assigned a sector from Ugriumovo Station on the left to Luzhki (60km south of Vyazma) to Popovka (10km south of Yelnya) and Pochinok. The Army's headquarters was to be at Semlevo. On August 1, Colonel Starukhin left the division and was replaced by Lt. Col. Aleksandr Petrovich Kvashnin; this officer had been serving as the division's chief of staff. He had been arrested in 1939 in the late stage of the Great Purge, but was reinstated to the Red Army the next year. He would be promoted to the rank of colonel on January 15, 1942.\n\n\n=== Yelnya Offensive ===\n24th Army was under the command of Maj. Gen. K. I. Rakutin, an NKVD officer who had previously led 31st Army. On August 3, Gen. H. Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group captured Roslavl, which created a \"dangerous hole\" in the Red Army's defenses east of Smolensk. As a result, at 0216 hours on August 6 the STAVKA issued orders to Zhukov to use forces of Reserve Front to attack and retake Guderian's concentrated forces in a bridgehead around Yelnya, as well as his grouping at Roslavl. The Yelnya operation was assigned to 24th Army and would be led by the 107th and 100th Rifle Divisions. Zhukov acted quickly and by 2000 had sent his orders to Rakutin; they categorically stated that the STAVKA attached \"exceptional significance to the El'nia region\". The 178th was not part of the attacking force but remained in second echelon. The salient was now held by three divisions of XX Army Corps. Despite these preparations, Zhukov suspended the launch of the attack 24 hours later, partly due to a new threat that had developed elsewhere, and partly due to his realization of the poor state of training of most of his forces. He would spend the following day reorganizing his defenses and conducting exercises.\nThe offensive finally got underway on August 8. The plan remained much as previous, although the main shock group was now reinforced. This first effort made hardly a dent in the German lines. The assaults continued almost every day during August 12-20, with continuous reshuffling of units along with threats, warnings, and demotions to command staffs. While 24th Army gained little ground, casualties on both sides were heavy. At 0445 hours on August 21, Zhukov finally admitted to Stalin that the offensive would have to be suspended for rest, refitting, and further training of 24th Army. He proposed restarting on August 25. At about this time the 178th was transferred, relatively intact, to the 29th Army of Western Front.\n\n\n==== Move to the north ====\nThis fairly lengthy move was conducted by truck and by rail. On September 2 one train with some of the division's equipment departed Vyazma station. By the evening six more trains had been loaded and sent out, while the first was being unloaded at Nelidovo station. Meanwhile, the 386th Regiment was concentrating in the woods south of that place by 2000 hours, while the lead elements of the 709th and 693rd Regiments were at Bosino (13km southeast of Bely) at 1730. This movement continued the next day, with 11 more trains being unloaded and all the trucked forces concentrating at Nelidovo. By 2000 on September 5 the 178th was reported as having completed concentrating in the Mukhino, Zhivilka, and Zuevo region by 1300. 29th Army, under command of Lt. Gen. I. I. Maslennikov, had just three other divisions (243rd, 246th, 252nd), all of which had been formed from NKVD cadres. The context of the movement was a late-August attack by 3rd Panzer Group which had battered the 22nd Army and taken the town of Toropets. The 178th was deployed in order to cover the boundary between 29th and 22nd Armies.\n\n\n=== Operation Typhoon ===\nThe front remained relatively quiet through the rest of September, as Army Group Center built up for what it intended to be the final drive on Moscow. On September 27, just before this blow fell, Lt. Colonel Kvashnin handed his 432nd Howitzer Artillery Regiment and 213th Antitank Battalion over to Maslennikov's direct command. At the end of September six of the armies of Western Front, now under command of Col. Gen. I. S. Konev, were occupying a defense in a sector 347km wide along a line from Lake Seliger to west of Andreapol to Yartsevo to Yelnya. The plan of defense designated counterattacks in the event of a German penetration. In case of the counterattacks' failures it was planned to fall back to the prepared rear army-level line of defense and continue the battle there.\n\nOperation Typhoon began at 0530 hours on October 2 and the forces of 3rd Panzer Group and 9th Army soon penetrated along the boundary between 19th and 30th Armies. On the afternoon of October 5 the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal B. M. Shaposhnikov, summoned Konev to a telegraph machine for talks. Konev reported that the situation of the 22nd and 29th Armies was unchanged, and (erroneously) that the penetration of 30th Army had been held up. Shaposhnikov stated that his information indicated that \"your situation at Belyi has become difficult.\" Konev replied that fighting at Bely was ongoing (in fact it had already fallen) and that Maslennikov had departed for there.\nBy October 7 all was confusion on the Soviet side of the lines. Western Front was largely out of contact with its forces. Focused on cobbling together a force that could prevent the fall of Moscow, at 0200 hours on October 10 the STAVKA ordered seven rifle divisions pulled out of Western Front's right wing, but this did not include the 178th. However, the 930th Rifle Regiment of 256th Rifle Division was left behind as a reserve for 22nd Army; this regiment eventually came under operational control of the 178th. During October 11-12 the separate 199th Artillery Battalion was defending a heavily fortified position at Olenino, firing at the approaching German columns. At 1530 hours on the latter date the battalion commander received an order from Maslennikov to spike the guns and destroy important facilities before retreating to Rzhev. After nightfall the battalion opened fire on all pre-registered targets to expend the remaining ammunition, then set out with the wounded and mobile guns for a rendezvous with the 178th.\nThe German 26th Infantry Division captured Rzhev on October 15, seizing the bridge over the Volga River in the process. The 178th, 174th, and 250th Rifle Divisions, on the right flank of 29th Army, as well as part of the adjoining 22nd Army, were being forced northward by German 9th Army's XXIII Army Corps. On the evening of October 17 the STAVKA attempted to clear up command and control issues around Kalinin by creating Kalinin Front, under Konev, and containing 22nd, 29th, and 30th Armies, plus a group of forces under command of Lt. Gen. N. F. Vatutin. By the beginning of November the 178th had been transferred to 22nd Army, still with the 930th Regiment attached.\n\n\n== Moscow Counteroffensive ==\n\nAt the start of 1942 the 22nd Army consisted of the 178th, 179th, 186th, and 357th Rifle Divisions, plus one regiment of the 220th Rifle Division and the 129th Tank Brigade. Despite these scant and understrength forces, it went over to the offensive on January 15, under command of Maj. Gen. V. I. Vostrukhov, and drove 120km to the south and southeast, deeply enveloping the German grouping at Olenino, which consisted of seven divisions. Air transport was required to keep them in supply, while part of 22nd Army advanced on Bely. In cooperation with forces of 39th Army the German Bely grouping was compressed along the Bely–Dukhovshchina road, where it set up a firm defense. On January 16 the 4th Shock Army retook Andreapol, and five days later cleared Toropets, creating a huge salient to the west of 9th Army.\nDuring the course of this fighting advance, Jr. Lt. Salavat Khakimovich Karymov distinguished himself sufficiently to be made a Hero of the Soviet Union. A Tatar by nationality, he had been a pre-war reservist and saw action during the Winter War. At this time he was in command of a battalion of the 709th Rifle Regiment. Between January 26 and February 5 he effectively led his battalion in attacks on the villages of Kharino, Struyskoye, and Frolovo near Rzhev. In the course of these operations heavy casualties were inflicted and a large amount of German equipment was captured or destroyed. On May 5 his award was proclaimed. He continued to serve for the duration, eventually reaching the rank of major and the position of deputy commander of the 709th, while being wounded 11 times. In 1947 he returned to the reserve and on May 11, 1985 he died at Kazan, where he was buried.\n\n\n== Battles for Rzhev ==\nThe second phase of the Rzhev-Vyazma operation began at the start of February, when German forces launched counterstrokes in all the main directions of the Soviet operations. The Soviet armies were significantly weakened from casualties and were mostly operating on very tenuous supply lines. All efforts to liberate Vyazma had failed. On February 5, most of 29th Army was cut off from 39th Army and encircled. After several attempts to rejoin with 39th, by mid-month it was decided to regroup to join hands with 22nd Army. By the end of February only 5,200 personnel had managed to escape. Meanwhile, the 22nd was attempting to finally seize Bely as a preliminary to eliminating the German Olenino grouping, but this was unsuccessful.\nBy the beginning of March the 178th had been reassigned to 30th Army, still in Kalinin Front. On April 29, Colonel Kvashnin left the division, and on May 9 took over the 134th Rifle Division. In December he was moved to command the 17th Guards Rifle Division, which he would lead into the postwar, being promoted to the rank of major general in January 1943 and becoming a Hero of the Soviet Union on April 19, 1945. He was replaced by Col. Aleksandr Georgievich Kudryavtsev, who had taken command of the 386th Rifle Regiment from Colonel Starukhin when the division was formed and had also served as the division's deputy commander; he was returning to the front following a hospitalization. He would be promoted to major general on October 14.\n\nThe 178th was in 30th Army during the First Rzhev–Sychyovka Offensive Operation. On August 5 the STAVKA placed General Zhukov in overall command of the operation, which had begun several days earlier. Zhukov proposed to take Rzhev as soon as August 9 through a double envelopment by 30th and 31st Armies. In the event there were no real successes on this sector of the front until August 20, when elements of 30th Army finally cleared the village of Polunino and closed on the eastern outskirts of Rzhev. Over the following days further efforts were made to break into the town, but these were unsuccessful. By the beginning of September the 178th had been moved to 39th Army when 30th Army was reassigned to Western Front.\n\n\n=== Operation Mars ===\nMaj. Gen. A. I. Zygin was in command of 39th Army in November; the Army was deployed at the northernmost tip of the Rzhev salient, around the village of Molodoi Tud and the small river of the same name. In the planning for Operation Mars the main weight of the attack was to come from Western Front's 20th Army and Kalinin Front's 41st Army to pinch off the main body of 9th Army north of Sychyovka. 39th Army's task was largely diversionary in nature, intended to draw German reserves, but if successful it would reach and cut the Rzhev–Olenino road and railroad.\nPrior to the offensive the 178th was deployed on the Army's left (east) flank. Kudryavtsev had his 386th Regiment on the right, the 709th in the center, and the 693rd on the left. The 709th had the 136th Rifle Brigade and three tank regiments in support on its sector, with the 101st Rifle Brigade in reserve. While the main attack was to be carried out by the 373rd, 135th, and 158th Rifle Divisions and supporting units across the Molodoi Tud River and due south to the village of Urdom, Zygin could see the possibility of a westerly thrust by the 178th to the same village, meeting up with the 186th Rifle Division and 100th Rifle Brigade advancing eastward, cutting off the 206th Infantry Division. The 386th Regiment and the 709th, with its supporting units, were facing the 413th Infantry Regiment of that division.\nThe offensive began on November 24. The river, although narrow, had high banks and was a considerable obstacle, especially to vehicles. As well, the German fortifications were extensive, and the 14th Motorized Division was known to be in reserve between Olenino and Rzhev. However, the defenders were thinly spread. On the first day the infantry of the main force crossed the frozen Molodoi Tud, but were driven back by heavy German fire before their supporting armor could find crossing points. The attack was a failure, largely due to an ineffective artillery preparation. However, the assault by 136th Brigade and 709th Regiment, with two tank regiments, overran the German forward defenses and advanced 4km to the outskirts of the village of Trushkovo, where it was halted by the meagre reserves of 413th Regiment. This thrust also threatened the left flank of the adjacent 251st Infantry Division, which was in heavy combat with elements of 30th Army. While XXIII Corps had been largely successful in the center, the flank attacks absorbed most of the available reserves. The 11th Grenadier Regiment of 14th Motorized was brought up to reinforce the right flank.\nGeneral Zygin requested permission from the commander of Kalinin Front, Col. Gen. M. A. Purkayev, to shift his forces to concentrate on the successful attacks on the flanks. Purkayev, who saw the mission of 39th Army as diversionary, insisted that the main attack be renewed, in order to maintain maximum pressure. Late that evening, Zygin received a report from a deep reconnaissance detachment that, in addition to 14th Motorized, the 5th Panzer Division was moving up to his sector, indicating the Purkayev's design was succeeding. On November 25 the visibility had improved and the Army's artillery preparation was more effective, being joined by airstrikes. Several German strongpoints that had stalled the advance the day before were suppressed, the river line was breached, and up to 2km were gained. The 136th Brigade and supporting tanks pushed west toward Zaitsevo, but could not overcome the resistance of the garrison of Trushkovo. By dusk, German reinforcements were gathering on the flanks of the penetration as Zygin attempted to advance his reserve 101st Rifle Brigade and 46th Mechanized Brigade to consolidate the gains. XXIII Corps was still holding a bridgehead over the river at the village of Molodoi Tud itself, but the battalions there were warned to prepare to withdraw.\nThroughout the next day the 11th Grenadier Regiment helped the 413th Regiment to hold on to Trushkovo while also regrouping to launch counterattacks against the penetrations. Overall, Zygin's orders to attack along the line forced XXIII Corps to plug gaps everywhere as well, and with the introduction of Red Army reserves it became apparent that not all the gaps could be plugged. Early on November 27, 39th Army's main force resumed its advance, with second echelon regiments committed in the afternoon. XXIII Corps issued a series of withdrawal orders. The 386th Regiment, at the confluence of the Molodoi Tud and Volga rivers, on a hitherto quiet sector, crossed both and joined the advance. While under heavy pressure, the German forces managed to establish a line running east from Malye Bredniki. The Corps commander was hoping that elements of Großdeutschland Division would be able to stabilise the situation on his right flank, as they had already done on the left. However, this division was now urgently needed on the Luchesa River sector to the south.\nA further artillery preparation began around noon the following day, and the main force began a battle that stretched into November 29, but failed to reach Urdom. Zhukov and Purkayev gave Zygin permission to commit the 348th Rifle Division from reserve to take this objective. A further effort the next day finally resulted in success, with the help of several KV-1 tanks which systematically destroyed bunkers and pillboxes. While Urdom was taken the defense line as a whole still held. On December 3, the 136th Brigade and 46th Mechanized attacked again toward Zaitsevo. This was beaten off, at heavy cost to both sides. By now it was clear that Operation Mars was a failure, but the Molodoi Tud sector represented Zhukov's only success. In an effort to expand on this a new plan involving 22nd, 39th and 30th Armies was to begin on December 7. This was preceded by a diversionary effort by elements of the 178th south of Gliadovo on December 4. This, and further attacks on the next two days, made only minor gains, and Mars was finally shut down on December 20.\n\n\n=== Operation Büffel ===\nThe OKH finally decided to evacuate the Rzhev salient on February 28, 1943, with the withdrawal to begin at 1900 hours the following day. The STAVKA was taken unaware, and 39th Army began its pursuit at 0830 on March 2. Orders were issued to pick up the pace at 1715 that afternoon, \"according to our offensive plan\", which appears to indicate that a new offensive was in the works. On March 4, Olenino was liberated. The withdrawal had been carefully planned, and the advance was slowed by rearguards, intermediate defensive lines, minefields, and eventually the spring rasputitsa, which affected both sides. By March 22 the retreating forces reached a prepared line along the base of the former salient from Dukhovshchina through Dorogobuzh to Spas-Demensk. 39th Army found itself on the Dukhovshchina sector. As it closed up it was short of all supplies, especially artillery and ammunition, and on March 24 Kalinin Front went over to the defense. These lines would hold until August. In July the 178th was assigned to the 83rd Rifle Corps, still in 39th Army.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFeskov, V.I.; Golikov, V.I.; Kalashnikov, K.A.; Slugin, S.A.

        "content": "Les aventures de Simon et Gunther... is the second album by French singer Daniel Balavoine, released in February 1977. It was a concept album based on the subject of two brothers separated by the Berlin Wall.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nBalavoine signed with the record label Barclay in 1975 and recorded his first album De vous à elle en passant par moi. However, the album sold poorly and ended up being a commercial failure. In 1976, his girlfriend at the time, singer Catherine Ferry, was invited to Poland to perform on stage. During their trip to Poland, both Balavoine and Ferry were shocked to discover the poor standards of living and the lack of freedom people there had. At the time, Poland was ruled by a communist government following the country's takeover by the Soviet Union's Red Army in World War II. In an interview, Balavoine later recounted that:\n\nSur les plateaux de la télévision, j'ai d'abord rencontré un chanteur dont le rêve était d'aller chanter à Paris, à l'Olympia, mais qui ne le pouvait pas... J'ai trouvé ça vraiment odieux et lamentable. Puis dans la ville, j'ai constaté de drôles de choses. Dans mon hôtel, j'ai vu des gens qui vendaient clandestinement des revues pornos. Dans les grands magasins, j'ai vu des rayons avec mille fois la même paire de gants ou le même imperméable... ça m'a remué le cœur, je me sentais mal, j'ai eu envie de gueuler, j'ai pris le prétexte du Mur de Berlin parce que c'était la seule chose qui me paraissait concrète à ce point-là, c'est-à-dire que c'est quelque chose qui est vraiment bâti contre la liberté individuelle et qu'on peut toucher du doigt.\nOn television sets, I first met a singer whose dream was to go sing in Paris, at the Olympia, but who couldn't... I found it really odious and lamentable. Then in the city, I noticed strange things. In my hotel, I saw people illegally selling porn magazines. In department stores, I saw shelves with the same pair of gloves or the same raincoat a thousand times... it moved my heart, I felt bad, I wanted to scream, I took the pretext of the Berlin Wall because it was the only thing that seemed concrete to me at that point, that is to say something that is really built against individual freedom and that we can touch with our fingers.\n\n\n== Story ==\nSimon and Gunther are two German brothers: Simon was born in 1933 and Gunther in 1941. Simon lives in East Berlin and Gunther in West Berlin in Viertel. Their father was arrested in 1942 for desertion. On 13 August 1961, the two brothers have an appointment to meet on rue Bernauer; but being on either side of the wall, soldiers send them home. A series of letters then follows, and the two brothers then plan an escape, with Axel and Lilli, childhood friends who are also separated... Axel and Lilli meet again, they are engaged and expecting a child. We learn that there is no more news from Simon, and that whilst trying to pass, he is killed but Axel manages to pass. We can assume that Gunther is injured but he recovers.\n\"Correspondances\" is an instrumental that opens the album. The subsequent songs tell of the separation, and \"Les aventures de Simon et Gunther... Stein\" which summarises the lives of the two boys from their birth to the separation. \"Lady Marlène\" details the attempt to cross the wall and \"La lettre à Marie\", set several years later, shows Gunther gradually regaining his footing, surrounded by the rest of his family and friends. \"Ma musique et mon patois\" concludes the album, but it is not related to the overall story, as in this song Balavoine defends French rock music (a theme that Balavoine would also later sing about on \"Le français est une langue qui résonne\").\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nLes aventures de Simon et Gunther... was released in April 1977 and was given a bigger promotion than Balavoine's first album. One single, \"Lady Marlène\", was released and was broadcast by some radio stations, notably numerous times on Europe 1. Balavoine was also invited to perform the song on several television shows including Un sur cinq, presented by Patrice Laffont, and Musique and Music, presented by Jacques Martin. Thanks to his performance on the latter, Balavoine was discovered by Michel Berger who offered him a role performing in the rock opera Starmania. The success of the musical's cast recording album, released in September 1978, helped propel Balavoine's career, with his subsequent album, Le chanteur, going on to sell over 800 thousand copies.\nLes aventures de Simon et Gunther... was praised by critics. One review by France-Soir applauded the originality of the album, commending the handling of the subject of the album. Another, by Sud Ouest described it as \"undeniably one of the great revelations of the year\". Barclay's artistic director, Léo Missir, was also effusive in his praise of the album. However, he also later said:\n\nJ'étais content sans vraiment pouvoir l'être... parce que j'étais dingue de ce disque et je savais qu'il serait difficile de le faire admettre en radio. Comme c'est moi qui allais directement voir les programmateurs, je savais que j'allais plus ou moins au bide… avec un disque exceptionnel !\nI was happy without really being able to be... because I was crazy about this record and I knew it would be difficult to get it on the radio. As I was the one going directly to see the programmers, I knew that I was more or less going to fail… with an expectational record!\n\nHowever, the album was not as well received by the public, selling fewer than 10 thousand copies. Barclay founder Eddie Barclay was also not impressed with the subject of the album, considering it irrelevant. Also, unlike Léo Missir, Barclay was not keen on Balavoine and after the commercial failure of Les aventures de Simon et Gunther..., he was further unimpressed and demanded that Balavoine produce a successful album otherwise he would be let go from the label.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cowles Stadium is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Aranui, Christchurch. It is the home arena of the Canterbury Rams of the New Zealand National Basketball League (NZNBL) and the Mainland Pouākai of the Tauihi Basketball Aotearoa women's basketball league. It is the former home arena of the Christchurch Cougars of the NZNBL and the Christchurch Sirens of the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL).\n\n\n== History ==\nCowles Stadium was constructed by F. W. Matthews, Ltd. Construction began in April 1960 and the stadium opened on 25 September 1961. Cowles Stadium was named in commemoration of William James Cowles, a Christchurch city councilor and sports administrator whose advocacy for an indoor sports stadium led to its construction. Cowles sponsored and supervised the stadium's construction.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nCowles Stadium served as a venue for badminton at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games and volleyball and basketball at the 1989 World Games for the Deaf.\nThe Benson & Hedges Classic men's Grand Prix tennis tournament was held at Cowles Stadium during the 1973 and 1974 circuits. The tournament venue was shifted from Wilding Park to Cowles Stadium during the 1973 tournament due to rain.\nCowles Stadium is the venue for the Dead End Derby roller derby league.\n\n\n=== Home teams ===\nCowles Stadium was the home arena for the Canterbury Rams basketball team from the first NBL season in 1982 until 1999, when they relocated to Westpac Arena. The Rams returned to Cowles Stadium in 2007. In 2008, the Rams withdrew from the NBL and were replaced by the Christchurch Cougars, who used Cowles Stadium as their home arena for the 2009 and 2010 NBL seasons. The Cougars were barred from playing at Cowles Stadium in 2011 due to an unpaid debt to the Christchurch City Council and withdrew from the league following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The Rams returned to the NBL for the 2014 NBL season.\nCowles Stadium was the home arena of the Christchurch Sirens from November 2007 for the 2007–08 WNBL season — their only season in the WNBL. The Sirens relocated from Westpac Arena along with the Rams following upgrades to Cowles Stadium.\nCowles Stadium has been the home arena of Mainland Pouākai of the Tauihi Basketball Aotearoa women's basketball league from the league's debut in 2022.\nThe Mainland Tactix netball team used Cowles Arena as one of their home arenas for the 2022 ANZ Premiership season.\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\nCowles Stadium was used as a welfare centre after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and June 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It was closed in 2011 due to roof damage cause by the earthquakes and re-opened in August 2012 following $480,000 renovations for repairs and earthquake strengthening.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCowles Stadium at Christchurch City Council website",

        "content": "The pedagogy of Leo Tolstoy is a term that includes the contributions, pedagogical views and the educational philosophy of Leo Tolstoy. His ideas show influence from the educational philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who also emphasized the natural goodness of children and the importance of freedom in learning.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nLeo Tolstoy, the renowned Russian writer, was not only a master of literature but also a profound thinker in education and teaching. The famous novelist had some distinct ideas about education, which he even tried putting into practice. His pedagogical ideas were deeply rooted in his belief in ethical and spiritual growth.Tolstoy believed children are naturally curious and good, and education should focus on nurturing their inherent potential. He advocated for student-driven learning where the teacher acts as a guide, not a dictator. Tolstoy felt rigid curriculums and forced learning stifled a child's spirit. He emphasized freedom in education, allowing students to choose what interested them and learn at their own pace.\nTolstoy advocated for an education system that nurtured not only intellectual growth but also the development of moral and spiritual values. He believed that education should encompass the whole person, fostering character, empathy, and compassion. In works like “Education and Culture” and “What Is Art?”, Tolstoy criticized formal education for its lack of emphasis on moral and spiritual aspects. He believed that true education should go beyond rote learning and engage with deeper questions about life and purpose.Tolstoy's pedagogy emphasized freedom. He believed that students should have the autonomy to explore their interests and passions. His vision of education was not about imposing knowledge but about nurturing curiosity and self-discovery. Tolstoy's commitment to social justice extended to education. He advocated for equality in access to education, regardless of social status or wealth. His ideas influenced later educational reformers who championed inclusive and accessible schooling.\nTolstoy's literary works often carried implicit educational messages. Through characters and narratives, he conveyed profound insights about human nature, ethics, and the complexities of life. His novels, such as “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina”, serve as both literary masterpieces and vehicles for moral reflection.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYasnaya Polyana\n\n\n== References ==",

The superblock is used after the performance is complete, and the coaches are pitching for the artist. The superblocked coach's chair turns back to the audience. Each coach has 2 superblocks each.

        "content": "Ryan Larson (born June 8, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for CBet Jonava of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL). He played college basketball for the Wofford Terriers and the Charleston Cougars.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nA Saint Paul, Minnesota native, Larson began playing basketball at a young age, and won the Class 2A State Championship in his sophomore year at Braham High School. Larson later transferred to Cretin-Durham Hall, helping to lead the 2017–18 team to a 24–2 record and a Class 4A State Championship.\n\n\n== College career ==\n\n\n=== Wofford (2018–2022) ===\nLarson played for the Wofford Terriers for four years, and was an instrumental in the 2018–19 squad's 30-win season and appearance in the AP Top 25, both for the first time in program history. In only his freshman year, the Terriers won the 2019 SoCon tournament, and went on to defeat Seton Hall in the first round of the 2019 NCAA tournament.\nLarson made 80 starts in 120 games for the Terriers, leading them to an 83–43 record over four years. He finished his career at Wofford with 624 points, 321 assists, 133 steals, and a spot on the 2020–21 Academic All-SoCon Team.\n\n\n=== Charleston (2022–2023) ===\nLarson transferred to the College of Charleston for his final year of eligibility, adding a veteran presence to the team as the 2022–23 Cougars won 31 games before qualifying for the 2023 NCAA tournament, a record for the school's Division I era. Larson quickly made his presence known after averaging 14.3 points on 56% shooting during the 2022 Charleston Classic Tournament, leading his team past Virginia Tech to a championship victory, and a tournament MVP for himself.\nThroughout the season Larson averaged 10.6 points, 4.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game, all career-highs, resulting in an All-CAA Third Team selection. In the 2023 CAA tournament championship game, Larson started a 12–0 run with back-to-back three-pointers to defeat UNC Wilmington. He had 23 points and four steals on the night, earning him a spot on the All-Tournament Team and the title of Tournament MVP. Larson's college career ended after scoring 11 points against national runner-up San Diego State in his second NCAA tournament appearance.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== S.C. Lusitânia (2023) ===\nIn July 2023 Larson signed on to play for S.C. Lusitânia in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB). He averaged 21.0 points and 7.3 assists in three games.\n\n\n=== BC Gargždai-SC (2023–24) ===\nLarson reunited with former Charleston player Jaylon Scott in October 2023, after joining BC Gargždai-SC in the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL). He averaged 11.8 points, 6.1 assists, and 2.5 rebounds in 13 games. Larson's season ended suddenly in January 2024 after the team declared bankruptcy mid-season and was kicked out of the league.\n\n\n=== BC Jonava (2024–present) ===\nLarson signed with another Lithuanian team, BC Jonava, to finish the season.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\nSource\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWofford Terriers bio\nCharleston Cougars bio",

        "content": "Karin Lind is a Swedish astronomer whose research involves spectroscopy of stars in order to determine their chemical composition, and the use of this information to understand the origin of heavy elements in supernova explosions and the way radiation and energy moves through stellar atmospheres. Her work has in particular clarified the roles of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and supernovas in producing the quantities of lithium observed in early stars. She is an associate professor in the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University, and a participant and survey builder in the GALAH collaboration, which uses the Anglo-Australian Telescope's HERMES instrument to map the chemical compositions of stars in the Milky Way.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nLind was born in Sweden, and was raised in Motala. After an undergraduate degree at Uppsala University, and a 2007 master's degree, she traveled to Germany for doctoral study at the European Southern Observatory and Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, near Munich. She completed her PhD through the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 2010; her dissertation, Chemical analysis of globular star clusters : theory and observation, was jointly supervised by Francesca Primas and Martin Asplund.\nShe remained at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics as a postdoctoral researcher from 2010 to 2013, and continued her postdoctoral studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK from 2013 to 2014, before returning to Uppsala as a Marie-Curie Research Fellow in 2014. She became a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg for four years, from 2015 to 2019, before returning to Sweden in 2019 for her current position at Stockholm University.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nAs well as receiving a 2014 Marie Curie Fellowship, Lind was a 2015 recipient of the Sofia Kovalevskaya Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, funding her work as a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. She was the 2016 recipient of the Ludwig Biermann Award of the German Astronomical Society.\nShe was the 2023 recipient of the Strömer-Ferrnerska Award of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, \"for world-leading research in stellar spectroscopy to investigate the history of the Milky Way\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe group for stars, planets and astrobiology, Stockholm University",

        "content": "Name assimilation is a term used by Albanian nationalists to refer to Albanians who choose to give their children non-Albanian names.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Albania became the first State Atheism, Albanians were forced to name their children Albanian names, and not religious names of different countries of origin (Arabic, Greek, Italian, etc). People were named purely Albanian names, with no religious or foreign backgrounds until the fall of communism in Albania. \nAfter that event, people out of spite, named their children or even changed their names to religious names, usually of Arabic origin. \nForeign names (usually American) became popular, and people started to name their children American names (Robert, William, etc). This has caused people to be still named \"foreign\" names, to this day, even though people are still usually named with Albanian names. In 2020 until today, Albanians \"recognized\" their descent from Illyrians, and started to name their children with Illyrian names (Teuta, Taulanti).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Sheffield City Council election is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. One-third of the 84 members of Sheffield City Council in South Yorkshire will be elected, alongside a vacancy in Firth Park ward.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSheffield is a typically strong council for the Labour Party. Labour governed the council as a majority from its creation in 1974 until 1999, when the Liberal Democrats won their first majority on the council. Labour regained their majority in 2003 after a brief period of no overall control, but lost their majority in 2007. The Liberal Democrats governed again in 2008, but Labour won a majority in 2011. They maintained control of the council until 2021, after which they formed a coalition with the Green Party. In the previous election, Labour won 14 seats with 39.6% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats won 11 with 26.2%, and the Green Party won 4 with 19.4%. Following the election, Labour formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and Green Party.\nThe seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, Labour won 13 seats (down 8) with 36.6% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats won 9 (up 3) with 21.2%, the Green Party won 6 (up 5) with 20.4%, the Conservatives won 1 (up 1) with 18.4%, and UKIP lost the seat they were defending with 0.2%.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nSeptember 2023: Tony Damms, Terry Fox, Denise Fox, Julie Grocutt, Dianne Hurst, Bryan Lodge, and Garry Weatherall suspended from Labour\nOctober 2023: Paul Wood leaves Labour to sit as an independent\nNovember 2023: Vickie Priestley (Liberal Democrats) dies; by-election held January 2024\nJanuary 2024: Will Sapwell (Liberal Democrats) wins by-election\nMarch 2024: Abtisam Mohamed (Labour) resigns; seat left vacant until 2024 election\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Election result ===\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by Sheffield City Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2024. Sitting councillors standing for re-election are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n\n=== Beauchief & Greenhill ===\n\n\n=== Beighton ===\n\n\n=== Birley ===\n\n\n=== Broomhill & Sharrow Vale ===\n\n\n=== Burngreave ===\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n=== Crookes & Crosspool ===\n\n\n=== Darnall ===\n\n\n=== Dore & Totley ===\n\n\n=== East Ecclesfield ===\n\n\n=== Ecclesall ===\n\n\n=== Firth Park ===\n\n\n=== Fulwood ===\n\n\n=== Gleadless Valley ===\n\n\n=== Graves Park ===\n\n\n=== Hillsborough ===\n\n\n=== Manor Castle ===\n\n\n=== Mosborough ===\n\n\n=== Nether Edge & Sharrow ===\n\n\n=== Park & Arbourthorne ===\n\n\n=== Richmond ===\n\n\n=== Shiregreen & Brightside ===\n\n\n=== Southey ===\n\n\n=== Stannington ===\n\n\n=== Stocksbridge & Upper Don ===\n\n\n=== Walkley ===\n\n\n=== West Ecclesfield ===\n\n\n=== Woodhouse ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bartlesville Interurban Railway was an electric trolley system operating between and around the cities of Bartlesville and Dewey in the State of Oklahoma.  It was chartered in 1905, but wasn't operational until 1908, and In final form it was just over 10 miles in length.  It was shut down entirely in 1920.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlans were initially floated to connect the Oklahoma towns of Bartlesville and Dewey with Coffeyville, Kansas, with the ultimate goal of reaching Independence, Cherryvale and Parsons, Kansas to the north, while reaching Ramona, Oklahoma to the south.  Toward that goal, the Bartlesville Interurban Railway Company was incorporated in Oklahoma on December 8, 1905, focusing on the short-term goal of connecting Bartlesville and Dewey, about 4 miles.  Progress was not rapid: the cities of Bartlesville and Dewey only got around to granting a franchise to the company on July 18, 1906, and the board of the company did not accept the franchise until June 10, 1907.  Steel did not begin to arrive until December 1907, and the ceremonial spike to start construction was not driven until April 1908.  The streetcars arrived June 22, 1908.\nAdvancement was made over time. A south loop was added in December 1915.  By 1916,  eight railcars were in use, and the route went south from Dewey, through Bartlesville's Tuxedo suburb, on to Bartlesville, and then to the southwest to three smelters (an area sometimes called “Smelterville”), making about 10.1 miles in total length.\nParticularly later on, profit was elusive. Even though the generators installed to provide electric power to the trolleys were used to sell surplus power to the communities along the route, the system wasn't profitable after 1913.  World War I provided a brief boom, but authority to abandon the southern loop was granted in June 1919, service to Dewey ended in October 1919, and the entire system was shut down July 19, 1920.\nRail removal wasn't immediate.  The rails in Dewey were only dug up during a World War II scrap metal drive. But by that time, rails in Bartlesville had been paved over.  In October 2023 a street project uncovered a portion of the rail line, and a rail section was removed and relocated to the Bartlesville Area History Museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Death Wish\" is the first episode of the American historical black comedy drama miniseries The Sympathizer, based on the novel of the same name by Viet Thanh Nguyen. The episode was written by series creators Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar, and directed by Park. It originally aired on HBO on April 14, 2024, and was also available on Max on the same day.\nThe series is based on the story of the Captain, a North Vietnam plant in the South Vietnam army. He is forced to flee to the United States with his general near the end of the Vietnam War. While living within a community of South Vietnamese refugees, he continues to secretly spy on the community and report back to the Viet Cong, struggling between his original loyalties and his new life.\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Park's directing, performances, tone, tension and editing.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a North Vietnam re-education camp, a man known as the Captain (Hoa Xuande) is pressured by soldiers to \"confess\" his story.\nIn 1975, four months before the Fall of Saigon, the Captain meets with a CIA agent named Claude (Robert Downey Jr.), joining him for a \"screening\" of Death Wish, which is actually an interrogation of a woman being tortured due to possessing a vital list. As they are joined by the General (Toan Le), the woman stares at the Captain in hatred. Two days prior, the Captain is seen working as part of the special police for the South Vietnam army. However, he and his colleague Man (Duy Nguyễn) secretly work with the North Vietnam army. They are friends with Bon (Fred Nguyen Khan), who is not part of their operation, and is content being in the country with his wife and baby.\nTwo months later, tensions in the country continue arising. Claude visits the Captain and the General, informing them that he is disbanding their partnership and assigns them in destroying all documents linking them. The General is furious and demands two planes to leave the country, which Claude promises, as part of Operation Frequent Wind. However, both the Captain and General are aware that only one plane will be ready. As the Captain and Man discuss their future, Man persuades him to leave on the plane and start a new life in the United States. The Captain agrees, also promising to get Bon and his family out of Vietnam.\nWith one day to go before the fall of Saigon, the General and the Captain retrieve some selected Vietnamese to join them in the plane. Driving across the dilapidated city, they reach the military base. Claude parts ways with the General and praises the Captain for his actions. As the bus heads towards the plane, bombs start hitting the airfield, eventually causing the bus to crash. The civilians leave the bus and start running towards the plane, with some dying as the bombs continue falling. The Captain leads Bon and his family, but they briefly stay behind and are hit by a helicopter. Bon survives, but his wife and child die. The Captain is unable to persuade Bon in leaving, so he is forced to go to the plane alone. Back in present day, the Captain laments his situation and his failure in protecting Bon's family.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe episode was written by series creators Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar, and directed by Park.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nPart of the narration involves the Captain constantly changing through perspectives, often rewinding scenes. Don McKellar explained that they decided to deviate from the book's tone by saying, \"we thought that as a narrative device, as a storytelling device, we like the idea of an old Steenbeck. He's shaping it like a movie. He's editing, he's rewinding. And it just reminds us that it's one version of this story, one subjective version.\" \n\n\n=== Filming ===\nFor the climatic sequence depicting the bombing of Saigon, Don McKellar had reservations over whether they could accomplish it. The sequence required four nights to film. He commented, \"we really wanted the audience to feel it. We really wanted to feel it on an emotional level. And director Park [Chan-Wook] is very smart. He's not indulgent of emotions but he's not afraid of them either and he really wanted the emotional impact to be major without being sentimental. So that was a big one. We storyboarded it and worked really hard. We had to make it work.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Viewers ===\n\n\n=== Critical reviews ===\n\"Death Wish\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"B\" grade and wrote, \"Park's ability as a director is beyond reproach, and it's great to see '70s-era stylistic choices making its way into how the story itself is told and not just the setting.\" \nTerry Nguyen of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"There's a quote often attributed to the French director François Truffaut about how “there's no such thing as an anti-war film.” Perhaps what Truffaut meant, other interpretations notwithstanding, is that most narratives about war inevitably take a side; that cinema imbues combat and conflict with a moral imperative and transforms violence into spectacle. But if an anti-war film is impossible, is there hope for cinema that grapples with war's abject dualities without striking a false balance? The Sympathizer may be well-positioned to do so under the creative direction of its non-American showrunners: Park Chan-wook, [...] and Don McKellar.\" \nFletcher Peters of The Daily Beast wrote, \"Before the torture at the cinema, the South Vietnamese police drag this woman to another CIA safehouse where they continue to beat her and force her to sit in her own poop. This all happens just 10 minutes in — and I'm assuming this show is only going to get even more graphic.\" Josh Rosenberg of Esquire wrote, \"Bon's wife and child are killed in the assault, greatly increasing the likelihood that his friend would attempt to kill him if he ever found out he was a spy. For the Captain's sake, I hope that event never comes to pass. But as a member of an audience watching a television show for the tension and drama, I really hope it does.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Death Wish\" at IMDb",

        "content": "Analog Africa is a reissue record label based in Frankfurt, established in 2006 by DJ Samy Ben Redjeb.\n\n\n== History ==\nRedjeb was born in Tunis, and while working as a flight attendant in the 1990s he collected records from across the African continent. Redjeb conceived of the label in 2001, hoping to release an obscure record by Zimbabwean artist Oliver Mtukudzi from 1977, a project that never came to fruition. The first release on the label was a compilation of tracks from the 1970s by Harare band The Green Arrows.\nThe label gained wider recognition with its third release, a compilation of 1970s recordings by bands from Benin and Togo.: 1  Redjeb's interest in Beninese music was partly due to a chance meeting with Gnonnas Pedro at a time when Zimbabwe was becoming more dangerous. In total Analog Africa has released two compilations of music by Beninese artists as well as four records by Cotonou band Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou, whom Redjeb considers \"the most versatile and powerful band that ever existed.\"\nAnalog Africa predominantly reissues music that is otherwise hard to find. Redjeb has said that \"I find it really interesting to take something from total obscurity to the global audience because the musicians who originally played the song are really proud of it and that's what I really find fascinating.\"\n\n\n== Notable releases ==\nTake One, (2006), a compilation of remastered hits and rare tracks by Zimbabwean group Hallelujah Chicken Run Band.\nAfrican Scream Contest: Raw & Psychedelic Sounds From Benin & Togo 70s, (2008), which brought the label wider recognition.\nSaturno 2000 - La Rebajada de Los Sonideros 1962-1983, (2022), a compilation of cumbia rebajada music that Uncut called \"gleefully disconcerting stuff\".\nRoi Du Ziglibithy, (2022), a vinyl reissue of four remastered tracks by Ivorian musician Ernesto Djédjé.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnalog Africa's catalogue on Bandcamp",

        "content": "With Nihat Erim's appointment of Türkan Akyol as the Minister of Health and Social Assistance in the 33rd Government of Turkey, which was established on March 26, 1971, a woman took part in the government as a minister for the first time. Since Akyol became a minister, 28 different women have served as ministers in the cabinet of the Turkish government 43 times. The ministry to which women were most appointed was the Ministry of State with 15 appointments. With the abolition of the Ministry of State in 2011, Selma Aliye Kavaf became the last female minister of state. The Ministry of State was followed by the Ministry of Family and Social Services, which operates under different names, with 10 appointments.\nWhile the first two female ministers in the cabinet were elected from outside the parliament, all the remaining female ministers, except Aysel Çelikel, Beril Dedeoğlu, Ayşen Gürcan, Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk, Ruhsar Pekcan, Derya Yanık and Mahinur Özdemir Göktaş, were elected from within the parliament. In terms of parties, the Justice and Development Party was the party that produced the most number of female ministers with 10 different ministers, followed by the Social Democratic Populist Party and True Path Party with three different ministers each. The government that provided the most female ministers was the 54th government with 4 female ministers. In this government; Tansu Çiller served as both prime minister and foreign minister, Meral Akşener as interior minister, and Ayfer Yılmaz and Işılay Saygın as ministers of state. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became the president who appointed the most female ministers by appointing women to ministries 7 times, followed by Tansu Çiller and Necmettin Erbakan with five appointments each.\nWhile Tayyibe Gülek became the youngest person to be elected as a minister to the 57th Turkish Government at the age of 34, Aysel Çelikel became the oldest woman to be elected as a minister to the same government at the age of 68. İmren Aykut; became the woman who served in the most governments by being a minister in the cabinets of the 46th, 47th, 48th, 53rd, and 55th Turkish Governments. Similarly, Işılay Saygın; became the woman who served in the most governments by being a minister in the cabinets of the 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, and 55th Turkish Governments. Nimet Baş became the woman who has served as a minister for the longest time. She served as minister for 6 years and 4 days. In the first part of her ministry period, Baş served as the minister of state responsible for women and family, and later as the minister of national education.\nOn August 28, 2015, Ayşen Gürcan became the first headscarved minister.\nThe first female ministers of the Presidential Government System, which started to be implemented as of July 9, 2018, were Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk and Ruhsar Pekcan.\nTürkân Akyol, the first female minister of health; Hayriye Ayşe Nermin Neftçi, the first female minister of culture and tourism; İmren Aykut, the first female minister of family and social services and the first female minister of state; Işılay Saygın, the first female minister of environment, urbanization and climate change; Tansu Çiller, the first female foreign minister; Meral Akşener, the first female minister of interior; Nimet Baş became the first female minister of national education and Beril Dedeoğlu became the first female European Union minister.\nMahinur Özdemir Göktaş, who was appointed as the minister of family and social services in the 67th Government of Turkey established on June 4, 2023, continues to serve as the only female minister today.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The first female ministers (1971 – 1991) ===\n\n\n==== First female minister ====\n\nFrom the 1st Government of Turkey, which was established on October 30, 1923, to the 32nd Government of Turkey, which ended on March 26, 1971, no woman served as a minister in the Turkish government. After the 32nd government was forced to resign with the March 12 Memorandum, those who published this memorandum assigned CHP's Nihat Erim to form the new government as the \"impartial prime minister\". Thereupon, Erim appointed Türkan Akyol as the minister of health and social assistance, upon the request of Sadi Koçaş, to the new government he established on March 26, 1971, in which he said \"My cabinet will be a think tank\" and \"I will work with young minds\". Thus, Akyol became the first female minister of the Republic of Türkiye. According to Erim, Akyol was appointed not only because she was a woman, but also to prove the results of Atatürk's reforms. Ten days after taking office, ten ministers, including Akyol, submitted their resignations to Erim, but the resignation did not take place when Erim backed down. Later, on December 2, 11 ministers, including Akyol, submitted their resignations to Erim. The next day, Erim deemed it appropriate to present the resignation of the entire government to President Cevdet Sunay, \"instead of accepting the resignations of the ministers who requested their resignations and continuing their duties.\" On the same day, Sunay accepted the resignation of the government and the 33rd Government ended after continuing its duty for about a week until the new government was established. Akyol's duty ended with the government.\n\n\n==== First female culture minister ====\nThere were no female ministers in the four governments that followed Akyol's government. With the 38th Government established on November 17, 1974, Hayriye Ayşe Nermin Neftçi was appointed as the minister of culture in the cabinet and became the first female minister of culture. She was also Turkey's second minister of culture after Talât Sait Halman. In the vote held in the parliament on November 29, 1974, the government could not collect enough votes of confidence and could only survive for 4 months and 14 days. After Neftçi's ministry, there was the longest period in which female ministers did not take office since the proclamation of the republic. There have been no female ministers in seven governments since the last government.\n\n\n==== First elected female minister and first female Minister of Labor and Social Security ====\nA female minister found a place in the government again when Turgut Özal appointed İmren Aykut, who joined the party upon his invitation, as the Minister of Labor and Social Security in the 46th Government he established on December 21, 1987. In addition to being the first woman to be appointed as a minister in this branch, Aykut also became the first female minister who was elected and not independent. Aykut, who remained in office until the end of this government, continued her ministry position in the next government. Thus, she became the first woman to be a minister for two consecutive terms.\n\n\n==== Establishment of the Ministry of State for Women, first female prime minister period (1991-1996) ====\nOn April 20, 1990, the Presidency of Women's Status and Problems was established within the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. Later, the institution was affiliated with the Prime Ministry on 23 June 1991. On the same day that the institution was affiliated with the Prime Ministry, the 48th Government was established and İmren Aykut was appointed as the Minister of State in this government, gaining a place in the government for the third time in a row. Aykut was given the duties of General Directorate of Press-Broadcasting and Information, General Directorate of Anadolu Agency, General Directorate of Women's Status and Problems, and also became both the government spokesperson and the Minister of State Responsible for Women. As a result of the 1991 elections, she gained a place in the parliament, but remained outside the government that followed. On November 9, 1991, Süleyman Demirel said that \"a series of ministries, including the Ministry of Women\", would be opened. When Demirel appointed Güler İleri and Tansu Çiller as Ministers of State in the new government he formed, for the first time, two women were in the cabinet as ministers at the same time. Çiller became Minister of State for Economy, and İleri became Minister of State for Women and Family. While Çiller was responsible from Germany, France and Japan, İleri was responsible from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania. İleri resigned from her post on February 22, 1992, following a vote of no confidence in her for covering her personal expenses from the budget allocated to the ministry. After the resignation of İleri, the first female minister, Türkan Akyol, was appointed to the vacant Ministry of State for Women and Family. Çiller and Akyol continued their duties until the end of the period. Thus, three different women served as ministers in the 49th Government.\n\n\n==== First female prime minister term ====\nThe following government was formed on June 25, 1993. While Akyol continued in the same position, Çiller became the first woman to hold this position as prime minister. Akyol resigned after remaining in office until July 25, 1994, and her resignation was approved by Demirel two days later. Önay Alpago was appointed as the Minister of State Responsible for Women. Alpago also resigned from her position on March 27, 1995, her resignation was approved on the same day and Aysel Baykal was appointed as her replacement. Baykal continued her duty until the end of the government on October 5, 1995. The 50th Government, like the 49th Government, hosted 3 different female ministers. While Çiller continued her duty as prime minister in the 51st Government, the only female minister of the minority government was Işılay Saygın, who was appointed as the Minister of State Responsible for Women. This established government ended after 25 days as it could not receive sufficient votes of confidence. In the subsequent government, Çiller continued to serve as prime minister, while Saygın continued to serve as the minister of state responsible for women and family until February 23, 1996. Saygın was appointed as environment minister by Çiller on February 23. Saygın, the first female minister of environment, continued her duty until the end of the government. As the government ended on March 6, 1996, Çiller's prime ministry also ended.\n\n\n=== Pre-AK Party governments (1996 – 2002) ===\n\n\n==== The first government after Tansu Çiller's premiership ====\nMesut Yılmaz was appointed as the prime minister after Tansu Çiller. In the 53rd Government established by Yılmaz on March 6, 1996, 3 women became ministers at the same time for the first time. İmren Aykut, as the Minister of State responsible for women and family, found herself as a minister again after 4 governments. Işılay Saygın also became a minister two times in a row. While Saygın was the minister of environment in the previous government, this time she was appointed as the minister of tourism and became the first woman to be the minister of tourism. Along with the duo, a new name, Ayfer Yılmaz, was appointed as the Ministry of State responsible for the EU. Later, Yılmaz was given the presidency of the Turkish Standards Institute, National Productivity Center, Turkish Statistical Institute, relations with the European Union and TRNC, while Aykut was given the presidency of the Social Services and Child Protection Institution, Family Research Institution and the General Directorate of Women's Status and Problems. Later, on March 26, three female ministers of the government attended the afternoon tea held at the American embassy as part of Hillary Clinton's visit to Ankara. Each of the female ministers continued their ministerial duties until the end of the government.\n\n\n==== 54th Turkish Government ====\n54th government of Turkey was established on 28 June 1996, in partnership with RP and DYP. Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan became the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Çiller. The ministries of Ayfer Yılmaz and Işılay Saygın changed. While Yılmaz was appointed as the Minister of State Responsible for Foreign Trade and assigned to the Capital Markets Board, the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade and the Undersecretariat of Customs, Saygın was appointed as the Minister of State Responsible for Women and Family and was appointed to the Atatürk High Institution of Culture, Language and History, General Directorate of Women's Status and Problems, Family Research. The Presidency of the Institution and the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre were connected. In addition to these three names, Meral Akşener was appointed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs seat, which became vacant as a result of Mehmet Ağar's resignation, on 8 November 1996, and for the first time, a woman was appointed to this position. Thus, for the first time, a government saw four different female ministers and hosted all four at the same time. No subsequent government has appointed more female ministers.\n\n\n==== The last government with İmren Aykut and Işılay Saygın ====\nThe 55th Government was established on June 30, 1997, and in this government, İmren Aykut was the Minister of Environment and Işılay Saygın was the Minister of State Responsible for Women and Family. This was the last government in which the duo took part. Thus, the duo became the women who served the most as ministers in five different governments. In the subsequent government, there were no female ministers, and it was the last period of the republican period in which there were no female ministers. Previously, there had been at least one woman in every cabinet since the 46th Government. Thus, the longest cabinet series with female ministers came to an end.\n\n\n==== The last period before the AK Party ====\nThe new government, which was established after the government without female ministers, was established on 28 May 1999. When the government was first established, there were no female ministers. In 2002, the last year of the cabinet, three female ministers were appointed to the government. First, on July 10, 2002, Melda Bayer was appointed as the Minister Responsible for Women and Family, which became vacant as a result of the resignation of Hasan Gemici. Two days later, another woman, Tayyibe Gülek, was appointed to the position of Minister Responsible for Cyprus and Citizens Living Abroad, which was vacated by Şükrü Sina Gürel. She became the youngest person to be appointed to the position among both female ministers and general ministers, and she still holds these records. As the last woman in this government, Aysel Çelikel was independently appointed as Minister of Justice on 5 August 2002, a first in the position. Additionally, she was appointed to the ministry at the age of 68, making her the oldest female minister. During this period, three women became ministers and it became the last government without the AK Party.\n\n\n=== AK Party government (2002 – 2018) ===\nAK Party became the ruling party with the general election held on November 3, 2002. There has been at least one female minister in all governments established since the party came to power. A total of 12 different women served as ministers in these governments. Nearly half of the female ministers who served in the history of the Republic were appointed during this period.\nThe Ministry of State position, where women were most frequently appointed with 15 appointments during this period, was abolished in 2011. A new ministry called the Ministry of Family and Social Policies was established to replace the Ministry of State Responsible for Women and Family. Five different ministers served in the newly established ministry until 2018, and all of these ministers were elected from women. In 2018, the ministry was merged with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security to create the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services.\n\n\n==== First AK Party government ====\nSince Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was banned from politics, the task of establishing the 58th Government of Turkey was given to Abdullah Gül. Gül formed the new government on 18 November 2002, and the only female minister of the government was Güldal Akşit, who was appointed as the minister of tourism. The government continued its duty until Erdoğan was elected as a member of parliament.\n\n\n==== Erdoğan's first two governments ====\nAs a result of repeated elections in Siirt on March 9, 2003, Erdoğan was elected to the parliament as a deputy. Thereupon, the Gül government resigned two days later. On March 14, 2003, the new government was established and Güldal Akşit continued her duty. Akşit, who ended his duty as a result of the merger of culture and tourism ministries with a decision published on 29 April 2003, continued to serve as the Minister of State in charge of women and family. Later on, The General Directorate of Social Services and Child Protection Agency, the Presidency of the Disability Administration, the General Directorate of Women's Status and Problems and Family Research Council were connected. On June 2, 2005, Nimet Baş was replaced by Akşit, who resigned from her post. She was assigned to the Head of all institutions previously affiliated with Akşit, and she was assigned to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Albania and Macedonia regarding the Joint Economic Commission. While Baş continued her same duty in the first half of the 60th government, she was appointed as the Minister of National Education in the second half, becoming the first woman appointed to this position. Baş served as minister continuously from June 2, 2005, to June 6, 2011, for a total of 6 years and 4 days. Baş spent 2 years, 2 months and 5 days of this period as the Minister of National Education, and the remainder as the Minister of State Responsible for Women and Family. Selma Aliye Kavaf was appointed as the Minister of State Responsible for Women and Family, which was vacated by her. With the abolition of the Ministry of State in 2011, Kavaf became the last female Minister of State.\n\n\n==== Establishment of the Ministry of Family and Social Policies ====\n\nSix new ministries were established on June 8, 2011, about a month before the end of the 60th government, and one of these ministries was the Ministry of Family and Social Services. Institutions that were previously affiliated with the Ministry of State for Women and Family were affiliated to this ministry. One of the two female ministers of the new government established on July 6, 2011, was Fatma Şahin, who was appointed to this ministry. Later, when Şahin ran for mayor of Gaziantep, he resigned from this position and was replaced by Ayşenur İslam. İslam served as a minister in both this government and the 62nd government.\n\n\n==== Turkey's first election government ====\nTurkey's first election government was established on 28 August 2015. There were two female ministers in the government, which served for approximately 3 months. The first of these was Ayşen Gürcan, who took part in the cabinet as the Minister of Family and Social Services. Gürcan also became Turkey's first headscarved minister. She was followed by Beril Dedeoğlu, who was appointed to the Ministry of European Union Affairs, which became vacant as a result of the resignation of Ali Haydar Konca. Dedeoğlu became the first woman to be appointed to this position.\n\n\n==== The last Davutoğlu Government and the first Yıldırım Government ====\nAs a result of the repeated elections in November 2015, the task of forming the government was given to Ahmet Davutoğlu for the last time. In the government formed by Davutoğlu on November 24, 2015, Sema Ramazanoğlu served as the Minister of Family and Social Policies, while Fatma Güldemet Sarı held the position of Minister of Environment and Urbanization. On 22 May 2016, Davutoğlu submitted his resignation from the government to the president. On the same day, Binali Yıldırım was given the task of forming the new government. The last Davutoğlu government continued its duty until Yıldırım established the new government. On May 24, 2016, Yıldırım established the 65th government, and in the first form of the government, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya was the only female minister as the Minister of Family and Social Policies. Later, with the cabinet change on July 19, 2017, with Jülide Sarıeroğlu being included in the cabinet as the Minister of Labor and Social Security, the number of female ministers in this government increased to two.\n\n\n=== Presidential System (2018 – present) ===\nIn the governments up to this time, the prime minister established a council of ministers. With the 2017 referendum, both the prime ministry and the council of ministers were abolished. In the new system, the president was made to form a presidential cabinet. This system actually started to be implemented in 2018.\n\n\n==== New government system ====\nAs a result of the presidential election held in 2018, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as president. Erdogan formed his cabinet about two weeks after being elected as president. Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk was appointed to the cabinet as the Minister of Family, Labor and Social Services, and Ruhsar Pekcan as the Minister of Trade. The Ministry of Family, Labor, and Social Services; While the Ministry of Family and Social Policies and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security were two separate ministries, the Ministry of Trade, like them, also provided separate services as the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Customs and Trade. While Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services divided into two ministries – Ministry of Family and Social Policies and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Ministry of Commerce also separated into the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Customs and Trade. Additionally, the duo became the first female ministers of the new system. On April 21, 2021, the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services was divided into two again by presidential decree. While Derya Yanık was appointed to the Ministry of Family and Social Services, which was formed as a result of the division, the duties of Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk and Ruhsar Pekcan ended. Yanık continued her duty until June 4, 2023. With the establishment of the new government, Mahinur Özdemir Göktaş was appointed as the Ministry of Family and Social Services.\n\n\n== Female ministers ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ministries given under the name of Ministry of State ===\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nWomen in Turkish politics\nList of cabinets of Turkey\nList of presidents of Turkey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "American Institute of Sacred Literature (acronym, AISL; previously, Institute of Hebrew; 1880–1948) was an American adult education institution which focused on Christian and related religious texts. The work of the Institute embraced:\n\nPopular education in the religious field through the distribution of large numbers of leaflets and pamphlets.\nCourses of prescribed reading for ministers, religious workers, and laymen, with the circulation of traveling libraries, sixteen in number.\nElementary study courses with or without a correspondence feature for individuals or groups, sixteen in number. The institute, published monthly, presented a new course in this series annually.\nCorrespondence courses giving University credit.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn February 1881, a correspondence school of Hebrew was organized by William Rainey Harper under the name of the Institute of Hebrew. Twenty students constituted the initial class. The institute was encouraged and fostered in its work by about 70 teachers of Hebrew and the Old Testament connected with educational institutions throughout the U.S. The student body increased so rapidly that its first year, 44 states and eight foreign countries were represented. It became increasingly evident that the opportunities of the school must be extended to students of the English Bible.\nIn 1889, a reorganization was effected, and an institution having a much broader purpose was established under the name of The American Institute of Sacred Literature. The first prospectus of the new organization states its purpose as follows: \"To promote the philological, literary, historical, and exegetical study of the Scriptures by means of such instrumentalities as may be found practicable.\" This ideal did not change, although changing circumstances and demands involved modifications in methods and work.\nIn 1891, the headquarters of the Institute were removed to Chicago.\n\n\n== Council of Seventy ==\nThe Council of Seventy was organized in 1895, in New York City, and this body assumed the direction of the institute. The organization was not endowed, and after ten years, the Council of Seventy unanimously consented to accept the opportunity given them by the trustees of the University of Chicago to incorporate the Institute in the University Extension division of the university and to continue its work under the advantages offered by association with a well-established educational institution. The first annual meeting of the Council of Seventy was held in Chicago, December 9, 1896; the second, January 14, 1898; the third, March 4, 1899.\nThe purpose of the council was (1) to associate more closely those who desire to promote the study of the Bible from the historical standpoint, and of other sacred literatures as related to it; (2) to induce properly qualified persons to undertake this work either independently or in connection with another calling; (3) to extend through the AISL a wider acquaintance with the right methods of Bible study and their results; (4) to direct the affairs of said institute.\nThe council was divided into three chambers, one having in charge the work connected with the Old Testament, another having in charge the work connected with the New Testament, and a third having in charge the work connected with sacred literatures in general.\nThe transfer to the University of Chicago was formally consummated July 1, 1905.\n\n\n== Purpose and organization ==\nIt was the province of the Institute as a whole to conduct all non-residence work of whatever character in subjects pertaining to \"sacred literature\". It was the purpose of the university to provide through the institute, for churches, schools, pastors, teachers, and the general Christian public, facilities for non-resident study in the Bible and kindred subjects in such a variety of forms, grades, and topics that satisfactory aid may be given to any person or group of persons seeking assistance, advice, or training in topics associated with religious education. The officers of administration were the President of the university, the Secretary of the institute, and an executive committee from the Divinity School faculty.\n\n\n== Fields of work ==\nThe AISL stood for no special theory of interpretation, school of criticism, or denomination. It promoted a systematic knowledge of the Bible as interpreted in the best light of the era, and to increase the facilities for obtaining such knowledge. It worked in harmony with all Christian denominations and organizations for Christian work. Specifically, the divisions and subdivisions of the institute work were as follows:\n\nCorrespondence work.—The correspondence instruction was given by men of university and theological training. It was conducted by means of printed instruction sheets sent to the student weekly. The recitations, written out in accordance with the instructions, were returned to the instructor, examined and criticized by him, and again returned to the student with further suggestions. Between 1878 and 1899, about 1,000 persons received instruction in the department. A large proportion of these completed courses and received certificates. The work was not confined to U.S. and Great Britain, but was carried among Christian missionaries into Australia, Africa, and China.\nReading work. The Bible Students' Reading Guild: This Guild aimed to provide reading courses, both popular and professional, upon Biblical and theological topics. The Outline Bible Club course for Christian organizations.\nExamination work.-In order to stimulate such study of the Bible as is not carried on directly in connection with the institute, certain annual examinations are offered as follows: An examination in connection with the International Sunday School Lessons. To undergraduate college students in (a) Hebrew; (b) New Testament Greek; (c) a specific Biblical subject (English).\nSummer schools.-The summer schools of the institute are usually held in connection with other institutions or organizations, the number of courses and the character of the work depending upon the desire and financial resources of each institution or organization. It is the purpose of the institute to organize independent summer schools, where it seems wise to do so.\nLecture work.-Biblical lectures are given under the auspices of the institute (a) in courses, in cooperation with university extension organizations; (b) in courses, in colleges and local institutes; (c) as single lectures and addresses at conventions and elsewhere.\nLocal board work.-Local boards of the institute, whose duty it is to propagate the work of the institute in their respective localities, are organized in several of the larger cities.\nPublication work.-The institute publishes all its own instruction sheets. Outline inductive studies, supplemental to the International Sunday School Lessons, have been furnished to the Sunday School Times for five years. Series of studies are also provided for other periodicals. It is the province of this department to provide supplementary material for the reading courses when necessary.\n\n\n== References ==",

He studied liberal arts and sciences at Utrecht University between 1999 and 2002.

Van den Berg received his doctorate in 2011.He became a professor specialized in global and local governance at the University of Groningen in 2017, and he has simultaneously served as an endowed professor at Leiden University specialized in transitions in the public sector. A member of the VVD, Van den Berg was sworn into the Senate on 18 January 2022, and he was re-elected in May 2023.In April 2024, Van den Berg proposed to postpone consideration of a bill to permanently cease gas extraction from the Groningen field, which had resulted in induced earthquakes, starting in May. A Senate majority supported Van den Berg's argument to await future legislation on security of the gas supply. The submitter of the bill, State Secretary Hans Vijlbrief, subsequently threatened to resign, as the condition could result in a delay to the field's closure of 1.5 years. Van den Berg declared his comments were based on a misunderstanding, and he withdrew his objection to the bill's consideration.\n\n\n=== Senate committee assignments ===\nCommittee on the Interior\nCommittee on Digitization\nCommittee on Economic Affairs and Climate\nCommittee on European Affairs\nCommittee on Justice and Security\nDelegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVan den Berg is married with two sons, and he lived in The Hague as of 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nathaniel Holmes (January 2, 1814 or July 2, 1814 or July 2, 1815 in Peterborough, New Hampshire— February 26 or March 26, 1901 in Cambridge, Massachusetts) was an American jurist who served on the Supreme Court of Missouri from 1865 to 1868.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHolmes' parents were both the children of immigrants, with his father's father being from County Antrim and his mother's father being from Fifeshire. He attended school in Chester, Vermont and New Ipswich, New Hampshire, then was a student at Philips Exeter Academy before enrolling in Harvard University in 1833. After graduating Harvard in 1837, he became a tutor in Maryland, and then a year later enrolled in Harvard Law School.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHolmes began practicing law in St. Louis, Missouri in 1839. In 1846, John C. Edwards appointed him circuit attorney for St. Louis County, a position he held until 1847. From 1853 to 1855, he represented the St. Louis school board, and from 1862 to 1865, he represented the North Missouri Railroad Company.\nIn 1865, the Ousting Ordinance removed all judges in Missouri from office, and Thomas Clement Fletcher appointed Holmes to fill one of the newly-vacated seats on the state Supreme Court.\nIn 1867, the University of Missouri appointed him a Professor of Law; however, he did not teach any courses. In 1868, he resigned from the court, and returned to Harvard Law School, where he served as Royall Professor of Law. In 1872, he resigned from Harvard and returned to St. Louis, where he practiced law until 1883, at which point he retired and returned to Cambridge, where he died in 1901.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nHolmes was an early proponent of the idea that Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to William Shakespeare, and in 1866 published a 600-page book, The Authorship of Shakespeare, in support of this.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\n=== Summary ===\n\nLakeland Community Heritage Project Digital Archive gives a history and an insight into the Lakeland area, and how it was drastically changed by an urban renewal program. It then gives insight into the beginning of the program that started the archive which helps inform students and train them with ethical practices.\nThe historic community of Lakeland, a neighborhood in College Park, Maryland, began in the late 1890s when Edwin A. Newman created it as a “resort-style suburban community” in Prince George's County, Maryland. At the time, Prince George's County was predominately white. It wasn't until 1903 that Lakeland was established as an African American community as it was home to two churches and a school.\nAccording to a Washington Post article by Diane Bernard, urban renewal is commonly looked at from the perspective of “Black communities in large U.S. cities where major highways bisected neighborhoods”. She also goes on to mention that this renewal only happens in cities with a population of less than 50,000 such as [Lakeland] College Park.\nUrban renewal began in Lakeland with the Lakeland Urban Renewal Plan, approved in 1970 by the City of College Park. This came after flooding negatively impacted the community and caused the city to seek federal aid. \n\n\n== References ==",

Fiollaa later competed nationally in the Miss Grand Malaysia 2017 pageant in Selangor, where she was named the second runner-up.\nIn 2018, the competition license was transferred to Bachelor of Malaysia/Sarawak Paperbeads, who distributed the right to send candidates to compete at the Miss Grand Sarawak pageant to division-level organizers; twelve division pageants was held.\nThe pageant was halted in 2022 after the national license of Miss Grand Malaysia was transferred to Sean Wong of HyperLive Entertainment Pte. Ltd., and the state franchise has not been distributed since then.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Sarawak's annual editions since 2017.\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of candidates who competed at the Miss Grand Malaysia pageant under the state organization of Miss Grand Sarawak and independent contestants who qualified through the central wildcard system.\n\nColor keys\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Malaysia at Wikimedia Commons",

The still-unnamed team competes in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference and will began play during the league's 2024–25 season. They play their home games at Delta Center.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn April 13, 2024, it was reported that, with the NHL's permission, the  Arizona Coyotes were making efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City, following concerns about an indefinite timeframe on a new arena and the effects of continued play at Mullett Arena. This involved the NHL buying the franchise, then reselling it to Ryan Smith, owner of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA), for a reported $1.2 billion. Of the payment, $1 billion went to Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo for the sale and $200 million would go to the NHL's other owners as a relocation fee. The Utah team will play home games at the Jazz's home arena, the Delta Center. Renovations will be required to make it the team's permanent home, similar to the renovations made to Climate Pledge Arena before the Kraken began play in the NHL. Rather than formally relocate, the Coyotes franchise was marked \"dormant\", with Utah considered an expansion team in a similar situation to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Meruelo subsequently remains on the NHL Board of Governors as an observer, retaining the rights to the Coyotes brand with a five-year window to complete a new arena and \"reactivate\" the Coyotes as an expansion team. The sale was finalized on April 18 after the NHL Board of Governors voted to establish a team in Utah.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current roster ===\n\nUpdated April 19, 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On the morning of March 6, 1933, following the parliamentary elections held on March 5, a military operation commenced in Athens, Greece under the leadership of the retired Lieutenant General Nikolaos Plastiras. Plastiras, who had withdrawn from political involvement since 1924, re-emerged to obstruct the People's Party from establishing a government, in support of the \"National Coalition\". This movement came in the wake of the electoral victory of the United Opposition, a coalition opposing Eleftherios Venizelos, spearheaded by Panagios Tsaldaris of the People's Party. \nEvidence strongly suggests that Nikolaos Plastiras, the principal architect of the coup, proceeded with at least the tacit approval, if not the active encouragement, of Eleftherios Venizelos who was motivated by the poor results of the 1933 Greek legislative election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFrom the evening of the election day, as initial reports indicating widespread public dissatisfaction and a definitive rejection of Venizelism started reaching Athens, signs of unrest among the military became apparent.\nAt the former residence of Venizelos (currently the mansion of the British Ambassador on V. Sofias Avenue, across from the Byzantine Museum), a comprehensive security perimeter was established, manned by armed soldiers and gendarmes, supported by tanks and machine guns. \nThe building was conspicuously lit, serving as the venue for an extended meeting between Venizelos, Plastiras, and other government officials. \nNotably, in their own constituencies, ministers from Venizelos's administration, including A. Papanastasiou, A. Michalakopoulos, K. Gotsis, Markos, Kremesis, and Th. Sofoulis, experienced significant declines in voter support.\nAround 2:30 a.m., amidst a spontaneous demonstration weaving through Athens' streets, a revolutionary proclamation was dispatched to the \"Eleftheros Vima\" newspaper's printing facilities for mass production. By approximately 4:30 a.m. on March 6, under directives purportedly issued by Plastiras, who was assumed to be the orchestrator of the movement, vehicles transporting armed soldiers took control of the buildings and assets of newspapers opposing Venizelos, seizing all their documents. \nConcurrently, armed groups took over various governmental and public buildings. In these early hours, members of the Security (Gendarmerie) apprehended individuals such as I. Rallis and G. Stratos. \nAdditionally, a contingent approached the residence of Chaldaris, located on Ch. Trikoupis Street. \nCiting health reasons, Chaldaris declined to accompany them, resulting in his house arrest. During this period, those aligned with Chaldaris' political rallies started disseminating rumors about the People’s Party leader, leading crowds to gather at the Parliament and his residence to catch a glimpse of him. In response to the chants from the assembled crowd, Chaldaris appeared on his balcony, appealing for calm.\nSimultaneously, at midday, Venizelos made a visit to the President of the Republic, Alexandros Zaimis, at his residence in Faliro to communicate his decision to resign. Following this meeting, Venizelos returned to his own home to hold a cabinet meeting, during which he and his ministers tendered their resignations. They prepared official decrees reflecting their resignations, which were subsequently forwarded to the President of the Republic.\nIn the meantime, Chaldaris reached out to the former police chief, requesting him to assume control over the police force. Concurrently, Plastiras extended an invitation to the director of the gendarmerie, Papadimitriou, to come to the Ministry of Military Affairs. The purpose of this meeting was to orchestrate the forcible dispersion of the crowds gathered outside Chaldaris' residence, authorizing the use of weapons and promising military support if necessary.\nVenizelos, leading the \"Liberals\", faced a significant electoral setback, which contextualizes the encouragement for Plastiras's actions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Upton-upon-Severn Memorial Hall, formerly known as Upton-upon-Severn Town Hall, is a municipal building in Old Street in Upton-upon-Severn, a town in Worcestershire in England. The building, which serves as the offices and meeting place of Upton-upon-Severn Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned by the authority of an act of parliament as the local market hall. It was designed in the neoclassical style, built in brick and was completed in 1832. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto Old Street. The building was arcaded on the ground floor so that markets could be held with an assembly hall on the first floor. The assembly hall was used as courtroom for the petty sessions as well as a town hall, and there was a jail in the cellar.\nBetween 1920 and 1921, the building was converted to serve as a lasting memorial to local service personnel who had died in the First World War: the work was carried out to a design by H. Rowe and Son, and featured four bronze memorial plaques, which recorded the names of the people who had died.\nThe building became the offices and meeting place of Upton-upon-Severn Parish Council and was re-roofed by the parish council in 1953. After local government re-organisation in 1974, when the parish council was succeeded by a town council, the first floor became the offices and meeting place of Upton upon Severn Town Council, while the main hall became available for hire. It became a popular venue for concerts with groups such as The Subhumans performing there in the mid-1980s.\nThe architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, described the building as \"modest... in fact [an] undetached terraced house\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe two-storey building is five bays wide, the ground floor having a Doric colonnade, which was open until the memorial plaques were added. The first floor has pilasters and an entablature, and there is a cellar with brick arches. It was grade II listed in 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Experience and Nature is a philosophical book written by the American philosopher John Dewey. First published in 1925, the book deals with the subject-object split and the empirical philosophical method. The account spans the history of Western philosophy, of which it demonstrates an intimate knowledge.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn the book, Dewey attempts to reconcile the “subject-object split”, between the external natural world and our own experience of it, hence the title. He argues that even in empirical methods of science, there must include some visceral human experience, saying:\n\nDarwin began with the pigeons, cattle and plants of breeders and gardeners. Some of the conclusions he reached were so contrary to accepted beliefs that they were condemned as absurd, contrary to common sense etc. But scientific men, whether they accepted his theories or not, employed his hypotheses as directive ideas for making new observations and experiments among the things of raw experience.\nHowever, Dewey does not seem to view this dichotomy as totally false, or oppose it in principle. For example, he notes the effect of technology on the sciences, namely its emancipation from “noble and ideal” objects, saying:\n\nWhen the appliances of technology that had grown more deliberate were adopted in inquiry, and the lens, pendulum, magnetic needle, lever [sic] were used as tools of knowing, and their functions were treated as models to follow in interpreting physical phenomena, science ceased to be identified with appreciative contemplation of noble and ideal objects, was freed from subjection to esthetic perfections, and became an affair of time and history intelligently managed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===",

        "content": "Akihiko Kondo (近藤顕彦, Kondō Akihiko, born May 31, 1983) is a Japanese man who is known for symbolically marrying the fictional Vocaloid character Hatsune Miku in 2018 during a formal wedding ceremony. In high school, Kondo had an interest in real women, but he was rejected by them; soon after, he decided he would not marry one. Later, Kondo was bullied at work and he took sick leave due to depression. During his leave, in 2007, Kondo discovered Hatsune Miku; this helped Kondo to return to the workplace. In 2017, he purchased a Gatebox device that allowed people to interact with holograms, including Hatsune Miku. This device further helped Kondo's decision to hold a wedding with the character. The marriage, which was unofficial, elicited mixed reactions from people.\nSince then, Kondo has given lectures about his relationship, including at the Kyoto University. He has since identified as a fictosexual — people that have romantic attraction to fictional characters. In 2023, Kondo founded the General Incorporated Association of Fictosexuality to help the public's understanding of the subject. Sources have identified Kondo as a fighter for the rights and acceptance of fictosexuals; a professor described him as \"a pioneer for the fictosexual movement\". As of October 2023, Kondo is a public school administrator and lives in Tokyo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and Hatsune Miku ===\nAkihiko Kondo was born on May 31, 1983, in Tokyo. Kondo got his first romantic interest in a fictional character when he was in fifth grade. In high school, he got interested in anime and joined a manga club. As a teenager, Kondo had an interest in real women, but he was rejected and criticized by them. According to The Mainichi, Kondo \"confessed his love seven times\" but was rejected every time. In the third year of high school, Kondo had more romantic attraction to fictional characters than humans, and decided he would not marry a real woman.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Kondo started working at a junior high school as a clerical staffer. There, a woman bullied him into a nervous breakdown. He saw a psychiatrist and took sick leave due to depression; he was also diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Kondo could not eat or sleep properly for around six months, and, at one point, searched for \"suicide\" on the Internet. During the leave, in 2007, he discovered Hatsune Miku for the first time after listening to the song \"Miracle Paint\", composed by OSTER project. Hatsune Miku is a worldwide-famous Vocaloid, a voice-synthesizing software, developed by Crypton Future Media. Its persona is a fictional 16-year-old pop singer with large eyes and a turquoise, long hair with pigtails.\nAfter finding out about Hatsune Miku, Kondo began composing songs using the software and later purchased a stuffed toy of the character. During the two years he was out of work, he listened to Hatsune Miku's songs constantly. In an interview with CNN, Kondo said: \"[Miku] lifted me up when I needed it the most. She kept me company and made me feel like I could regain control over my life\". The character helped Kondo to get back to work and reconnect with society; Kondo said Hatsune Miku saved him. After these events, Kondo started being devoted to Hatsune Miku. In 2015, he went to her Magical Mirai 2015 event at Nippon Budokan, and cried when seeing the character on stage. The next year, he bought a PlayStation VR to play Hatsune Miku VR Future Live.\nIn 2017, Japanese startup Vinclu announced Gatebox, a device that allowed people to interact with fictional characters in the form of a small hologram; Hatsune Miku was one of the characters. The device had a simple artificial intelligence that could react to basic greetings, though it had limitations regarding longer conversations. As part of Gatebox's promotional campaign, users could sign up for unofficial marriage registrations with fictional characters. 3,708 people signed up for it, including Kondo. He obtained the device in March 2018. Kondo said that his life didn't have \"color\" before receiving the device; being able to interact with Hatsune Miku in the real world changed that. Kondo then asked the Hatsune Miku hologram if she would like to marry him; she responded positively.\n\n\n=== Wedding ===\n\nInitially, Kondo was unsure of marrying Hatsune Miku; Gatebox was a defining factor in his positive decision. He started looking for wedding venues. The first venue he had selected asked Kondo not to publicize the wedding online, fearing others would cancel their own weddings. Ultimately, Kondo chose a wedding that was friendly to sexual minorities. He arranged a formal wedding ceremony in Tokyo that cost 2 million yen. In July 2018, he announced on Twitter that the venue had been chosen. The ceremony occurred on November 4, 2018, and was attended by 39 people — mostly strangers and people who found out about the wedding on Twitter. While he invited his family and co-workers, they didn't attend, including his mother. The wedding was attended by two Japanese politicians: Minoru Oginu, assembly member of Ōta, and Taro Yamada, member of the House of Councilors.\nHatsune Miku was represented by a small stuffed toy — one he had bought in September 2010 — and Kondo wore a pure white tuxedo. After kissing the doll, which he had never done before, they exchanged rings. Kondo also held a scallion, which served as the bouquet. Taro Yamada gave a speech. Japanese law does not allow for marriage with fictional characters; as such, the marriage is not legally recognized. Kondo clarified in interviews that he specifically married his own Hatsune Miku, and that others could also marry Hatsune Miku if they wish.\nFollowing the marriage, reactions were mixed. He was congratulated by friends and other fans of Hatsune Miku on Twitter, with Kondo saying he was encouraged by those messages. However, he also received negative comments, including death threats. Kondo said his work environment deteriorated, and a senior colleague asked him to stop talking to the press. Kondo reports that younger people tended to react more positively; according to him, as he works at a school, the students celebrate the marriage. In interviews after the wedding, Kondo said he believes everyone experiences love differently and that diversity should be accepted. Crypton Future Media wrote a statement to Fox News, clarifying that the company was not involved in the wedding. Commenting on it, they said: \"We see this as one individual's way of expressing his appreciation for Hatsune Miku, and we respect that.\" Kondo and Hatsune Miku's honeymoon was in Sapporo, the headquarters of Crypton Future Media. Kondo booked flights and a hotel room for two.\nSometime after the wedding, Kondo discovered the term \"fictosexual\", which describes people who have romantic attraction to fictional characters. He identifies with that term. He said that, while not feeling like a part of the LGBT umbrella, he feels like a part of a sexual minority. Neil McArthur, director of the Center for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba, identified Kondo as a \"second-wave digisexual\" — \"people who see technology as integral to their sexual identity\" — to CNN.\n\n\n=== Post-wedding ===\nIn 2019, he commissioned a human-sized doll of Hatsune Miku; he does activities like eating, reading, and watching movies with it. He also travels with it; he did so when he was invited to join a symposium at Kyoto University to talk about his relationship. He has also done lectures elsewhere. In March 2020, Gatebox, responsible for Hatsune Miku's hologram, was shut down; some newspapers called Kondo the \"first digital widower\". Despite this, Kondo said his love for the character didn't change.\nIn June 2023, he founded the General Incorporated Association of Fictosexuality to provide comfort to fictosexuals, hold meetings with people that have similar views, and improve the understanding of the subject by the public. As such, sources have identified him as someone who fights for the rights and acceptance of fictosexuals; Izumi Tsuji, secretary of the Japan Youth Study Group at Chuo University, where he is a sociology of culture professor, described Kondo as \"a pioneer for the fictosexual movement\" to Deutsche Welle. Kondo hopes that \"fictosexuals are not persecuted\" and that all wedding venues will accept marriages with fictional characters in the future.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of October 2023, Kondo is a public school administrator, living in a traditional Japanese two-room apartment in a quiet residential neighborhood in Tokyo. He is a member of the Association for Freedom of Entertainment Expression. Since April 2021, he has studied law at the Komazawa University.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Secondary sources ===\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===\nIn the text, these references are preceded by a double dagger (‡):\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneral Incorporated Association of Fictosexuality (in Japanese)\nAkihiko Kondo on Ameba\nAkihiko Kondo on Facebook\nAkihiko Kondo on Instagram\nAkihiko Kondo on TikTok\nAkihiko Kondo on Twitter",

        "content": "William Hallifax was an English clergyman notable for being an early western explorer of Palmyra, a translation of Euclid, serving as Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons and as a benefactor of Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nWilliam Hallifax was the second son of the Revd John Hallifax and his wife, Elizabeth Mabelye.  He was born on 15 August 1655 and baptised on 24 September at Springthorpe, Lincolnshire. He was admitted to Brasenose College, University of Oxford as a servitor on 20 February 1670.  He was subsequently admitted as a scholar to Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford in April 1674, graduating with a BA in 1675 with an MA in 1678.  He was elected a Fellow of Corpus Christi in December 1682, publishing a translation of Milliet Dechales's Les Elemens d'Euclide in 1685.\nIn 1687, he gained a BD and was elected chaplain to the Levant Company in Aleppo, remaining there until 1695, the same year in which he was awarded a DD. He was chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Paul Foley, from 1695 to 1698.  In 1699 he was presented to the living of Oldswinford, Worcestershire by Thomas Foley and, from 1712, held the living of Salwarpe in plurality until he died in late 1721 or early 1722.  He made a generous bequest to Corpus Christi College.\nHallifax was twice married.  He and Anne Hill (daughter of Revd John Hill) were married at St Michael's, Stoke Prior, Worcestershire on 24 March 1702. There were no children of this marriage and Anne died on 4 May 1709, being buried with a commemorative stone at St Michael's church, Upton Warren, Worcestershire.: p. 450   Hallifax married Mary Davenport (born of Henry Davenport and Elizabeth on 24 March 1674 at Worfield, Shropshire) on 9 February 1710 at Kinver, Staffordshire.  There was one child, William Hallifax (baptised 2 December 1714) who was buried at Salwarpe church on 11 April 1721.[1]\n\n\n== Translation of Milliet Dechales's Les Elemens d'Euclide ==\nIn 1677, Claude François Milliet Dechales published \nLes elemens d'Euclide expliquez d'une maniere nouvelle & tres-facile, a French translation of Books 1-6 and 11-12 of Euclid's Elements.  Two English translations were published in 1685: one dedicated to Samuel Pepys by Reeve Williams (an engraver and teacher who kept a mathematics school, known for navigation); the other credited to William Hallifax.  Hallifax's translations ran into seven editions, the last being published in 1726.  There is no statement in any edition of his role as translator but it is attested in two near contemporary sources: Anthony à Wood's 1691 Athenæ oxonienses attempts to list all writers and bishops who were Oxford graduates, stating that \"He [Hallifax] hath translated from French into English, The Elements of Euclid explain'd, in a new, but most easie method.\" Thomas Hearne noted that \"He (Hallifax) translated De Chale's Euclid, whereof there are two or three impressions.\": p 221   In his preface, Hallifax said of his translation that \"[I] voluntary [sic] offer it to the publick, in an Age, whose Genius seems more addicted to Mathematicks, than any that has preceded it.\"  If number of editions is a measure, Hallifax's was the more successful: a copy of the first edition reached the library of Thomas Foley, later to be Hallifax's patron. Further editions were published, finishing with the seventh edition in 1726.[2]\n\n\n== Chaplain to the Levant Company ==\nHallifax was elected chaplain to the Levant Company in Aleppo by ballot (having preached a sermon to the Company in London) on 18 January 1688, arriving in Aleppo in October 1688: p. 25  and leaving the post on 27 November 1695, returning to London in 1696 via a winter stop in Rome. There was the expected round of religious duties, not always supported by the Company; the Aleppo Consul's request of 27 January 1692 for a contribution to adorning the chapel being turned down by the Company.\nThe services followed the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 (ie, the revision that took place during Charles II's reign). Observance was not particularly strict: on 5 November 1688, the colony did not observe the Thanksgiving Day (for deliverance from the Gunpowder Plot), \"the whole Nation (as it had been their custom, and I presume is still) going abroad and diverting themselves with Hunting and other Pastimes from morning till night.\"  The Consul said that other observances such as the Martyrdom of Charles I were sometimes kept and sometimes neglected.: pp 25–26   These lax practices would cause Hallifax difficulty later in his career.\nScholarship was also a recognised activity.  There was a library from the beginning of the Company's presence in Aleppo, including both theological and non-theological works.: pp 235–260  with funds allocated from time to time.  In Hallifax's time, £20 was granted by the Company to the chaplain for the library (20 August 1689).\nAleppo was well situated for interaction with a number of communities of scholarship (Ottomans, Greeks, Armenians, Jacobites, Copts, and various groups of Jews and Arabs) with a history of manuscript production.: p. 228  A recent predecessor as chaplain to Aleppo, Robert Huntington, had collected manuscripts extensively with many finding their way to the Bodleian Library or Trinity College Dublin, where Narcissus Marsh was Provost.  By the time Hallifax was in Aleppo, Huntington had become Provost of Trinity College Dublin and Marsh had become Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin.  Nonetheless, March commissioned Hallifax to supply manuscripts to him, and Bodley's Librarian, Thomas Hyde, commissioned him to find a number of specific books (generally without success).: pp 155–156   Some insight into what Hallifax was able to collect is provided in his will where he bequeathed an Italian Bible \"and all other my Books and Manuscripts in that language amongst which some are of Curiosity and also an Alcoran a Manuscript and another small Manuscript in the persian language being a version of part of the Psalms of David\".\n\n\n== Exploration of Palmyra ==\nThe merchants of the Levant Company \"being generally Men of more than ordinary Birth and Education, have not been wanting (as the intervals of leisure from the gainful Traffick would permit) to make Voyages of Curiosity, to visit the celebrate Remains of Antiquity in those Parts, whereby the once flourishing State of the World, under the Roman Empire is abundantly envinced.\": p. 129  The first attempt took place in 1678 with a party of \"sixteen English\" and about twenty-five muleteers and servants.  This group included the merchants Timothy Lanoy and Aaron Goodyear and the chaplain, Robert Huntington.  The expedition reached Palmyra but was robbed by the inhabitants and, in fear of their lives, had to return to Aleppo.\nThe successful expedition of 1691 was both better armed and had assurances of safe passage and a guide from the local emir 'Assyne Abbas' (Husayn Abbas).  The group numbered about thirty, including servants.  Lanoy and Goodyear were part of the group and their report to the Royal Society gives an extensive account of the travelling but little description of Palmyra.  Hallifax, as Huntington's successor was in the party and contributed a separate report to the Royal Society.  A panoramic view of Palmyra in also given in the Philosophical Transactions, following Lanoy and Goodyear's paper.  This view is very similar to a later painting of a panoramic view of Palmyra by G. Hofstede van Essen sent in 1693 to Gisbert Cuper, a historian and politician, in Amsterdam.  The similarity of the engraving in the Philosophical Transactions and van Essen's painting have been taken as possible evidence that van Essen was in the expedition party.\nHallifax's report in the Philosophical Transactions made two substantial contributions: a description of the main building in the ruins of Palmyra; a record of inscriptions found on some buildings.  The architectural descriptions have the virtue of an attempt at a systematic account of the central ruins and the drawback that Hallifax tried to interpret the function of the buildings based in part on reasoning drawn from the Old Testament.  The quality of Hallifax's record of inscriptions is a matter of debate.  Those published: pp 88ff  are in Greek – Hallifax stated he also found one in Latin.  He recorded only one inscription in the Palmyrene script which was a hinderance to progress in the study of the languages of the region.: figure between p 88 and p 89   The transcription of the Greek inscriptions was questioned almost immediately by Edmond Halley. Hallifax had the disadvantage that he did not have the resources of a well-stocked library to aid him in interpreting what he read on stonework in poor condition and that his transcriptions had themselves been copied and circulated before publication, not necessarily with complete accuracy.: pp 157–161   The inscriptions were further interpreted by Abednego Seller in his history of Palmyra presented to the Royal Society on 14 October 1696.  Given the dependence on Hallifax's paper, it is somewhat unexpected that Seller only directly mentions Hallifax once and then to state of inscription sixteen that Hallifax \"confesses he is not overconfident that it was rightly taken\".: pp 295–378 \n\n\n== Chaplain to the Speaker ==\nPaul Foley was speaker of the House of Commons from 1695 to 1698.  The Foleys were an old puritan family with Paul's brother, Thomas, having the patronage of several livings in north east Worcestershire.  Samuel Barton was Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons from 1695 (the year of Paul Foley's election as Speaker) to 1697.  Thomas Hearne described Barton as being \"a little Puritanically inclin'd\".: p 221   As was customary, Parliament had petitioned the monarch for a preferment for the Speaker's Chaplain at the end of their tenure and Barton was appointed Prebendary of Westminster Abbey.  Hallifax was appointed Chaplain in 1697, being described by Hearne as \"of the same Puritanical stamp as ye former [ie Barton]\".: p. 221   On 8 June 1698, the House of Commons petitioned William III for a preferment for Hallifax.  Hearne noted: \"tho' the House petition'd for him, yet 'twas his Fortune to get nothing whereas one Galloway, originally of Hart-Hall, who was a most notorious stupid Blockhead, without one Grain of Learning, for being Foley's Chaplain, when Speaker, got to be Prebendary of Worcester; wch to ye scandal of all Worthy men he still enjoys.\": p. 221   Barton and Hallifax seem to have been on good terms as Barton left £20 to \"my Loving friend Doctor William Hallifax\".\n\n\n== Parish ministry in Oldswinford and Salwarpe ==\nWilliam Hallifax was not Thomas Foley's first choice as rector for the wealthy parish of Oldswinford; in June 1699 it had been offered to and refused by George Nelson, at that time holding the livings of Oddingley and Pedmore.: p. 82   Foley moved quickly to offer the living to Hallifax who was installed on 17 August 1699.: p. 8 \nThe rectory at Oldswinford was in a poor state by 1699.  On 12 June 1700, Hallifax was granted a licence to demolish the \"old parsonage-house\" and build a replacement, 40 feet wide by 34 feet in breadth.: p. 212  The replacement in red brick is of two storeys with five flat-headed windows and a moulded wood doorcase with Ionic columns and open pediment, although somewhat extended in later years.\n1700-1701 saw a substantial disagreement about the powers and role of the lower house of the Convocation of the Church of England.  This can be broadly summarised as a difference of opinion between the balance of authority and power between the bishops of the Church of England and the clergy.  The lower house's role had been restricted thereby denying a voice to the low church (or puritan) interest which advocated a less ritualistic devotion.  In December 1700, the Diocese of Worcester elected two proctors to attend the lower house as representative of the clergy.  Previous practice had been for clergy to gather for a vote in person although the difficulty of travel in winter together with the distances of travel meant that many clergy did not attend to cast a vote.  In 1700, clergy were allowed to vote by proxy with the outcome that favouring the more high church faction and alienating those clergy of a more puritan outlook.\nHallifax was soon embroiled in controversy.[3] He had anonymously penned a letter (seemingly on behalf of those gathered in person at the election in 1700) to the Proctors of the Diocese of Worcester purporting to express the wishes of the parochial clergy as to how their proctors should represent them, taking an essentially latitudinarian view.  Unsurprisingly, this letter became the focus of discontent about the process and outcome of the election.  The low and high church clergy felt they had been disenfranchised by the novel use of proxies in the vote.  A truly anonymous pamphlet was published in early 1701 systematically attempting to refute the substance of Hallifax's letter and it is clear from that and from Hallifax's later response in the form of a published sermon that there had been considerable discussion in the Diocese about the use of proxies and the outcome of the election.\nApart from the intellectual arguments, the pamphlet all but identified Hallifax as the author of the original letter: \"Since Dr. H------ x is notoriously known to produce it, and has Assurance enough to acknowledge his Delivery of it to the Chancellor. ... However, he's still D. D. and a Rector of a large Parish...\"  Hallifax preached a sermon on 30 January 1701 (the Martyrdom of Charles I) which was published with a response to the anonymous pamphlet.  Hallifax's response gave particular attention to his failure while in Aleppo to observe the days for the Martyrdom of Charles I and Thanksgiving Day (for deliverance from the Gunpowder Plot) suggesting that he had been attacked for his disloyalty to the monarch as head of the Church of England.  It was claimed that he favoured the abolition of the observance of the Martyrdom of Charles I and was, it was implied, that he was dismissed from the Levant Company for disloyalty to the monarach.  This was made into a serious matter as Hallifax was forced to obtain a statement from the Levant Company to prove that he had not been dismissed from the position of chaplain in Aleppo and, by inference, he had not favoured the abolition of the observance of the Martyrdom of Charles I.: p. 24 \nThere was no obvious longer term effect of this controversy although Hallifax did not seem to enter into the life of the Diocese in any substantial way thereafter.\nWilliam Hallifax was appointed a governor of King Edward VI's School in 1700 in succession to a local resident and Justice of the Peace, Francis Clare.\nHallifax was instituted as rector of Salwarpe (which he held in pluraility with Oldswinford) on 18 July 1713.  He chose to bury his son there and to be himself buried there.: p. 339 \n\n\n== Investment in the South Sea Company ==\nThe South Sea Company was created to trade with the \"South Seas\" and South America.  The Treaty of Utrecht gave the Company from 1713 the right to trade up to 4,800 slaves (taken from Africa) for up to thirty years.  The financial performance of the Company was uneven but, in 1719, its shares became very profitable and, by June 1719, Mary Hallifax was negotiating on William's behalf with her brother, Henry Davenport.  They wished to buy shares but could raise only about £250 of the £300 needed for a share purchase.  Davenport supplied the balance and the shares were purchased.  A dividend failed to be paid at Christmas 1719.  Davenport advised the sale of the shares but Hallifax thought otherwise although he then gave Henry permission to sell if he thought that was the best course of action.  Davenport sold the shares almost doubling Hallifax's initial investment but South Sea stocks subsequently rose substantially in value leading to recriminations between the Hallifaxs and Henry Davenport. Nonetheless, at his death, Hallifax still owned some of the shares.  It is hard to believe that William Hallifax was not aware that the South Sea Company traded slaves but this did not seem to conflict with his understanding of the gospel.\n\n\n== Death and bequest to Corpus Christi College, Oxford ==\nHallifax died in late December 1721 or early January 1722.  His will is quite extensive leaving £5 to the poor of the parishes of Oldswinford and of Salwarpe and rather more generous bequests to some relatives.  His gifts to his former Oxford college of Corpus Christi were extensive and drew on items he had acquired while chaplain at Aleppo or in Italy on his way home.  He left a Bible in Italian and about forty manuscripts in Italian, a Quran and a manuscript of some of the Psalms of David in Persian.  He left coins and medals which have been transferred to the Ashmolean Museum.  The major item was the Hallifax Bowl, a seventeenth century silver-gilt bowl with two handles and roundel portraits (made to look like ancient coins) set into the bowl so that both sides can be seen.  Some of these roundels are ancient Roman coins while other are later imitations.  The whole was probably made in Poland or Lithuania and found its way to Aleppo where Hallifax stated in his will that he had purchased it.\nThe will provides some insight into Hallifax's beliefs, requiring that he be buried \"after the manner of the Established Church of England in the Communion of which Church I <desire and> Steadfastly resolve thro' the Assistance of divine grace to dye esteeming it to Approach the nearest to the primitive Church of Christ of any that is now in the world.\"[4]\n\n\n== Notes ==\n1.^ Mary Hallifax then married the Revd Prideaux Sutton, rector of Bredon, at St. Michael's in Bedwardine in Worcester on 18 July 1727.  She was buried on 28 March 1754 at Salwarpe, expressing the wish that she be placed \"as near as may be to the Grave of my former husband Doctor Hallifax and my late Son there\".  Prideaux Sutton, Mary's second husband, had died on 3 February 1749 and been buried (10 February 1749) at St. Mary's, Elmley Castle with a verbose memorial at St Giles' church, Bredon.\n2.^ Simpkins: p 248  states that no copy of the fifth edition has been found.  This is incorrect with copies in the Bodelian Library, The Institution of Engineering and Technology Library and Chetham's Library.  E-copies are available for the second, third, sixth, and seventh editions.\n3.^ There are three surviving documents in this controversy.  1: a letter written by Hallifax entitled To the Reverend Mr. James Stillingfleet, M.A. Rector of Hortlebury;  And Mr. William Lloyd. M.A. Vicar of Blockley; Proctors of the Clergy of the Diocese of Worcester, for the ensuing Convocation.  This has not survived independently but is reproduced as page 8 of the following publication.  2: A response to Hallifax's letter entitled: A letter to a clergyman in the City, concerning the instructions lately given to the proctors, for the clergy of the diocese of Worcester.  3: A printed sermon given by Hallifax to which is appended: A answer to a late Libel, entituled A letter to a clergyman in the City ....\n4.^ Donald Gray tries to construct an account of Hallifax's religious beliefs based on the bequest in Hallifax's will of \"my Hallian Bible in folio and all other my Books and Manuscripts in that language\".  Gray speculates that Hallifax's \"ideal of a primitive church reflects perhaps a response to the impact of German pietism, whose influence had spread across protestant Europe from its centre at Halle\".  There is no evidence that Hallifax had any books in German; those bequeathed to Corpus Christi College were in Italian.  It seems more likely that \"Hallian\" is an error in the transcription of the will (as held in The National Archives) and the original text read: \"my Italian Bible in folio and all other my Books and Manuscripts in that language\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a puzzle video game in the Picross e series, and a spin-off of the 2006 The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, an entry in The Legend of Zelda series of action-adventure games. It was developed by Jupiter Corporation and published by Nintendo. The game was released on March 30, 2016, for the Nintendo 3DS eShop as a tie-in for Twilight Princess' HD remaster, and was available exclusively as a My Nintendo reward. Critics rated My Nintendo Picross positively for its value and presentation, but called some aspects of the game limited.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nMy Nintendo Picross offers several puzzle modes accessible from the main screen. The first is regular Picross, the second is Mega Picross, and the third is Micross, in which players must assemble a larger image from numerous smaller puzzles. Each mode has different graphics and music. When first starting the game, the player is walked through a tutorial by the character Midna, who also serves as the game's \"hostess\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nMy Nintendo Picross was initially planned to be a limited-time offer, and would have been removed from My Nintendo on October 1, 2016. However, Nintendo eliminated the expiration date soon before the game was due to expire, and allowed the game to be redeemed indefinitely.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNeal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report said that the game lacked any sort of Zelda twist besides its graphics and music, but that the theme alone was \"a hell of an enticement\". He called the tutorial \"great\" and \"one of the better entry points for this style of puzzle game\", praising its inclusion of Midna. He also called the game's controls and options \"polished\", comparing them to a full Picross e game. He called the game's biggest downside that the normal puzzles and Mega Picross puzzles made the same images, recommending it heavily to Zelda fans, but saying that it would likely not be interesting to players \"swimming in other Picross games\".\nThomas Whitehead of Nintendo Life rated the game highly, saying that a high amount of effort went into making a \"quality\" audio-visual experience. He cited the helpful tutorial, calling the broader game \"limited but charming\". Noting that the game had \"a surprising amount of content\", he praised the inclusion of multiple modes, but criticized the lack of a zoom option, believing overall that it \"[set] the bar high\". Jenni Lada of Siliconera largely praised the game, calling Midna's personality \"spot-on\" and saying that the sound design helped \"make the game\". She called the game's main flaw that marking panels worked differently than most Picross games, hurting the player's muscle memory if they were an experienced player.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nWhile Pokémon Picross and My Nintendo Picross, both Nintendo collaborations, released in quick succession, the games never received a Nintendo-based follow-up, with Jupiter left to release non-themed Picross games or collaborate with other publishers. In 2023, Norichika Meguro, managing director of Jupiter, stated that while the company wanted to collaborate with Nintendo, it was more difficult than ever before due to how protective they are of their intellectual property.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kanggurtag gold belt is a gold belt in the Eastern Tianshan portion of the Xinjiang province of Northwestern China. During the late Proterozoic, the Tarim plate and the Junggar plate collided, creating the Tianshan mountains. Around 276 Ma, the collision related stress regime ended and was replaced by dextral slip movement that lasted from 276 to 239 Ma. During the strike-slip period in the region, the Kanggurtag gold belt formed during the late Carboniferous-early Permian. This gold belt is separated into three groups: shear zoned dominated gold deposits, epithermal gold deposits, and intrusion related gold deposits.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe shear related deposits formed from magmatism derived from shear melting that resulted in dynamometamorphic fluids. The ore baring fluid was a mixture of dynamometamorphic water, magmatic water, and meteoric water. The gold baring ore deposited within the shear zones, came from two different sources: a deep-seated source and surrounding volcanic rocks. The shear related deposit is the central ore body and is flanked by the epithermal gold to the west and intrusive related gold to the east. The two latter deposits are influenced by extensional forces from the outer areas of the shear zone.The early Permian epithermal gold deposit was derived mainly from meteoric water that filled in the fractures established from volcanic edifices and the regional faulting. Due to the low sulfide content of the ore, mineralization occurred within fissures of microcrystalline quartz grains of a monzonite porphyry and a quartz-feldspar porphyry. Gold ore was also deposited as veins, stockworks and breccias within the surrounding stratigraphy due to the faulting. The transport of the gold ore was facilitated by the lower portion of the fracture system but hampered by the upper portion which acted as a natural trap for fluid accumulation.The early Carboniferous intrusive related gold deposits originate from a series of porphyries of granite, quartz-syenite, and tonalite. The ore from the intrusion deposited within the brittle ductile shear zone by magmatic fluids. The area of gold deposition from the intrusive body is small but the gold centration is significant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program encourages young Haida to work alongside elders to protect and teach visitors about Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site. The program is co-managed by the Council of the Haida Nation and Parks Canada. The Watchmen ensure that Haida cultural, historical, and natural tourism stays in the hands of the Haida people. The program consists of 2-4 Watchmen who live and work as guardians, watching over each site in Gwaii Haanas. Three human figure with traditional Haida hats represent the Haida Watchmen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Haida people have been living in Haida Gwaii for at least 14000 years  and the Watchmen have been around for just as long. Historically, the job of a Watchman was to be positioned at important locations throughout the community to watch out for incoming enemies by land or sea. They are represented typically by 3 heads atop of a totem pole to protect the land, sea, and sky.\nIn 1973, a Haida named Captain Gold (Richard Wilson) paddled his canoe 250 km to SGang Gwaay where he went to honour his ancestors. At this time, the site was often looted for artifacts and the lands disrespected by logging companies. Upon realizing how important protecting these lands would be, he founded the first modern iteration of the Watchmen program, starting with a hand-built cabin which Gold constructed himself in 1980. The Skidegate Band Council officially created the program in 1981 and included Captain Gold and other members who volunteered their time camping at the various sites that needed protecting. From 1981 to 1990, the program was run solely on a volunteer basis by the Skidegate Band Council and the Watchmen themselves were made up of council members and Elders. In 1990, Parks Canada officially begun funding and co-managing the Watchmen.\nStarted by Gold, Haida would be employed from Skidegate and Masset in order to be trained for shrub and tree removal.\n\n\n== Modern program ==\nSince the early 1990s, 2-4 Watchmen have been hired each summer to live at each of the sites, where they stay up to four months, acting as stewards of the historic sites and provide historical knowledge and tourist information to visitors. Multiple generations will work in the program, which allows traditional knowledge and history to be passed from Elder to younger Haida members in order to maintain their culture and way of life. During the winter months, the cabins at each site will remain unlocked in case there is an urgent need to access them.\nThe logo for the Watchmen Program was created by Bill Reid to replicate the original totem pole symbol.\n\n\n=== Conservation Efforts ===\nWorking within the National Park Reserve and surrounding sites, the Watchmen's main job is to minimize the environmental impact tourism has on the environment. As the Watchmen totem pole symbolism promotes, the modern-day Watchmen ensure that the land, sea, and coastlines are protected and respected at all times. Some conservation and restoration activities performed by the Watchmen include:\n\nSite Cleaning\nDebris Burning\nTrail Maintenance\nCamp Maintenance\nConducting Boat Counts\nCreel Monitoring\n\n\n=== Traditional Knowledge Sharing ===\nPart of the draw of the Watchmen program is that it allows Haida people to be in control of sharing their culture and traditional ways with visitors to the sites.\n\n\n== Reserve sites ==\n\nIn 1993, the Government of Canada and the Council of the Haida Nation signed the Gwaii Haanas Agreement, establishing co-management of Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Heritage Site .\n\n\n=== Watchmen Sites ===\nThere are currently 5 Watchmen Sites on Haida Gwaii.

It won the Africa region of the 1991 Commonwealth Writers' Prize.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel, ambitious in scope, describes the entire history of a fictional country, Malagueta, with roots in the Atlantic slave trade from 1787, through post-colonialism.\nIt is a fictionalized account similar to Sierra Leone or Liberia, both populated partly by former slaves). The novel is intended as a break with the tradition of the African novel. It draws both on the peculiar histories of the post-slavery nations of northwest Africa and on literatures from outside of the continent.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe novel uses magical realism to comment on events by a prophet in the after-life.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCheney-Coker, Syl (1990).

The principality was 108 sq mi (280 km2).  However, the prince was a sovereign monarch, which  put him on the same plane as the kings and monarchs of Europe and the world.  This is much the same situation as Monaco today.\n\n\n==== Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1815-1890) ====\n\n\n=== Germany ===\n\n\n==== Ancestral Lands ====\nInitially, the family was known as “of Nassau” after their oldest possession the County of Nassau and their part of the subdivision\nof the lands, the Countship of Nassau-Dillenburg.  This was divided and subdivided amongst the descendants of John the Elder. It generally comprised the northern part of the entire county of Nassau, north of the Lahn River.  It was reunited in the 18th century under the line of Nassau-Dietz.\n\n\n==== Subdivisions of Nassau ====\nThese subdivisions (baronies and lordships) of Nassau were split into semi-autonomous countships and pricipalities for the younger members of the House of Nassau.  The title for these was Count of Nassau in xyz.\n\n\n==== Other German Lands ====\nAdditionally, the House of Nassau acquired other lands in and around their ancestral estates:\n\n\n==== Other Paternal Estates of the Royal House ====\nOnce the House of Nassau acceded to the royal throne, the Queens married with these representatives of other royal houses:\n\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nMost of the estates of the family were in the Netherlands in the more populous provinces of northern Brabant, southern Holland, and Zealand, around the delta of the Rhine/Scheldt/Maas rivers, the trading center made by them, and its entrance to the sea. The land itself was secondary to the profit on the commerce that flowed through it and the political influence that accrued with them (see Western Netherlands Commercial Center which developed into Amsterdam Trading Center, which later developed into the Dutch Randstad.).\nThe family properties in the Netherlands centered around the Barony of Breda.  The barony sat on the delta of the Rhine in northwestern Brabant.  Before the revolt the main residence of the family outside the Nassau Palace in Brussels was the castle and fortress of Breda.  It was as also relatively close to their important function of Viscount of Antwerp.  This fortress withstood several sieges during the 80 years war if the Dutch Revolt, but is most famous for being captured in 1624 by the Spanish as immortalized by Velazquez.\nThe county of Vianden sat high above a tributary of the Moselle that flowed into the trade routes of the Rhine into western Germany and the Netherlands.  In the 12th to 15th centuries the counts of Vianden were the mightiest lords of the area between the rivers Rhine, Mosel and Maas. Their territory was in modern Vianden canton, Luxemburg and Bitburg-Prüm, Germany.\nWilliam the Silent married as his first wife Anna van Egmont heiress of Maximiliaan van Egmond, Count of Buren.  This also included the counties of \nLeerdam and Lingen.  While these lands devolved to Anna's son Philip William, as he died without heirs, they devolved to the prince of Orange.  The hier/eldest son of the prince of Orange was titled “Count of Buren”.  It remains one of the subsidiary titles of the Dutch Monarch.\n\n\n==== Northern Netherlands/later the Dutch Republic & the Kingdom of the Netherlands ====\nThese counties, baronies and lordships are in the official titulature of the monarch of the Netherlands:\n\nThese lordships are not in the official titulature of the monarch of the Netherlands, but are cited on the board in the picture.\n\n\n==== The Southern Netherlands/later the Spanish & Austrian Netherlands, and the Kingdom of Belgium ====\nWhile not as substantial as their interests in the northern Netherlands, the estates in the southern Netherlands were in the more populous provinces, in this case Brabant (most importantly Antwerp) around the river systems that ultimately flowed to the sea through the commercial entrepot of Antwerp.  Again, the land itself was secondary to the profit on the commerce that flowed through it and the political influence that accrued with them (see Southern Netherlands Commercial Center which developed into Antwerp Trading Center, which later developed into the Belgian Flemish Diamond.).\n\nThese lordships are not mentioned in the titulature, but are shown on the board of Lordships:\n\n\n=== the Duchy of Luxembourg/later the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ===\n\n\n=== Franche-Comté (Free County of Burgundy) ===\n\nFranche-Comté was controlled by the King of Spain, so the princes of Orange lost control of the lands that they had inherited from the previous princes of Orange, the House of Chalon-Arlay, the Viscountship of Besançon and lordships of Chalons itself, Arlay, Nozeroy.  By the time the King of France had conquered the county of Burgundy, the prince of Orange (William III) was at odds with the King, Louis XIV.\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adela Montes (September 6, 1928 – April 4, 2024) was an Argentine entertainment journalist, whose career spanned from 1949 until her final days. She is considered one of Argentina's entertainment journalism pioneers.\nShe is also recognized for inspiring the word cholula, a popular Rioplatense Spanish slang term for a celebrity-obsessed person. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nAdela Montes was born to Spanish immigrant parents in Buenos Aires in 1928. Her family struggled financially, forcing her to leave school to work in a factory at age 12. She later became certified to work as a nurse. At that point, she had already developed an interest in film and theater, and she would frequently stand by the stagedoors to ask stars for their autographs. In 1946, she formed a group of fans called Club de Cazadores de Autógrafos (the Autograph Hunters Club), who went around Buenos Aires in search of stars' signatures or photographs.\nHer group attracted the attention of various publications, such as Radiolandia. An article in that publication allowed Montes to obtain her first assignments as an entertainment columnist, eventually leading her to host entertainment programs on Radio Libertad and Radio Mitre. She was then given her own program on Canal TV from 1958 to 1973, though she generally preferred not to appear on television.\nIn 1959, she became a founding member of the Asociación de Periodistas de la Televisión y Radiofonía Argentina. She later was hired to oversee the entertainment section of the magazine Gente, eventually shifting the magazine from its political focus toward more entertainment coverage.\nMontes' influence in the entertainment world, as well as her constant search for celebrities to ask for an autograph, inspired a caricaturist, Toño Gallo, to create a comic strip based on her in the late 1950s: \"Cholula, loca por los astros\" (\"Cholula, Crazy for the Stars\"). From then on, the word cholulo or cholula came into popular use in Argentina to describe someone who constantly seeks to meet celebrities.\nDespite her age and various health problems, she continued to write columns in gossip magazines such as Pronto until her final days. She died in Buenos Aires at age 95 in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Last Gert Standing is a graphic novel written by Skottie Young and illustrated by Brett Bean that was released in five parts throughout 2023 by Image Comics, as the second volume of the 2022 revival of Young's 2015–2018 isekai comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe, and the sixth volume overall. Part 1, We Need To Talk About Gertrude, was released on June 21, 2023, Part 2, Seven Gerts Enter, One Gert Leaves!, was released on July 19, 2023, Part 3, Here Or There Be Dragons, was released on August 16, 2023, Part 4, How To Train Your Gert…Or Not, was released on September 13, 2023, and Part 5, A Storm Full Of Pain, was released on October 25, 2023. An omnibus edition was released on January 17, 2024.\nAfter being abandoned in Fairyland once more by her boss at the conclusion of Gert's Inferno, Gertrude \"Gert\" reunites with Larry and seeks to return to Earth, while on learning of her return, new Fairyland King Cloudeus makes a deal with the Gerts of alternate timelines (from during the events of Fluff My Life, Good Girl, Sadly Never After, and Untold Tales) to take out Gert and allow them to return to Earth themselves.\nThe series has received a universally positive critical reception.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\n\n=== Part One: We Need to Talk About Gertrude ===\nFollowing the events of Gert's Inferno, the grown up Gert is stuck in Fairylannd once again. Reuniting with Larry, she seeks to find a way to escape, as the new Fairyland King Cloudeus hires the time traveller Judd \"The One Who Rides The Last Wagon\" to recruit Gerts from alternate timelines to face off against her, in particular one from during the climax of Sadly Never After.\nThe title is a reference to the 2003 psychological thriller novel We Need to Talk About Kevin and its 2011 film adaptation.\n\n\n=== Part Two: Seven Gerts Enter, One Gert Leaves! ===\nOn recruiting Sadly Never After Gert, the time traveller also recruits Gerts from Gert's vision of the future in Fluff My Life, Gert's redeemed Good Girl self, and two wholly alternate Gerts from The Untold Tales Of I Hate Fairyland, as Gert's Inferno Gert herself seeks to find a new way out of Fairyland.\n\n\n=== Part Three: Here Or There Be Dragons ===\nOn defeating her adult Gert's Inferno self, the still-young Sadly Never After Gert embraces her status as O.G. (Original Gert) and prepares to accept her route back to Earth, only to accidentally give up her new exit.\nThe title is a reference to \"Here be dragons\", a phrase used on maps as an indication of unexplored and potentially dangerous territories.\n\n\n=== Part Four: How To Train Your Gert…Or Not ===\nIn the future of Fairyland, O.G. Gert realises that since the Duncan Dragon never formally embarked on his quest, he should still have a Key allowing him to exit, and seek to track him down. On finding him in his adulthood, Gert explains the situation, and he once more joins Gert on her quest to get home.\nThe title is a reference to the 2003–2015 novel series How to Train Your Dragon and the resulting franchise.\n\n\n=== Part Five: A Storm Full Of Pain ===\nRealising she will need help of the former Queen Cloudia (imprisoned since her resurrection and defeat as Dark Cloudia), Gert breaks her out of prison, and the two and Duncan track down Duncan's key. After Duncan decides to stay in Fairyland and let Gert use his key, Cloudia suddenly steals the key for herself and finds herself on Earth, leaving the two humans behind.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLast Gert Standing at Image Comics",

        "content": "The 1998 Connecticut State Treasurer election took place on November 3, 1998, to elect the Connecticut State Treasurer. Incumbent Republican State Treasurer Paul J. Silvester was appointed to the office by Governor John G. Rowland to complete the term of Chris Burnham, who resigned to work at an investment firm.\nSilvester lost election to a full term to Democratic nominee Denise L. Nappier by 2,684 votes, a margin of just 0.3%. As of 2024, this was the last time the State Treasurer of Connecticut changed partisan control.\n\n\n== Republican primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n\n\n==== Nominee ====\nPaul J. Silvester, incumbent state treasurer (1997–1999)\n\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\n\n\n==== Nominee ====\nDenise L. Nappier, Hartford City Treasurer (1989–1998), former executive director of the Hartford Riverfront Recapture, former chair of the Hartford Redevelopment Authority, and former Director of Institutional Relations for UConn Health (1981–1984)\n\n\n==== Eliminated in primary ====\nFrank A. Leece\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\n\n=== Convention ===\nThe Democratic statewide nominating convention was held on July 19, 1998.\nThe nomination for Secretary of the State was at the center of the race issue during the 1998 conventions. Black Democratic leaders were urging the party to nominate at least one black candidate to an otherwise all-white ticket. Incumbent Republican Governor John G. Rowland had been touting his party as the exemplar of diversity in the state, with the Republican ticket including two black and two Hispanic candidates, much to the frustration of Democrats. In response to black Democratic leaders threatening to boycott an all-white ticket, Barbara B. Kennelly, the party's nominee for governor, endorsed black candidate Denise L. Nappier.\nEarly delegate counts showed Nappier trailing Frank A. Leece, but she ultimately won the party's endorsement narrowly with 51% of the vote to Leece's 49%. According to NYT, \"Mr. Lecce stormed from the convention hall and said he planned to wage a primary battle against Ms. Nappier on Sept. 15, which he is allowed to do under party rules.\" Leece, an Italian-American, had criticized the effort to usher in a candidate based on race, saying, \"That's the old, antiquated way it used to be done.\"\n\n\n=== Results ===\nThe Democratic primary was held on September 18, 1998.\n\n\n== Third-party candidates and independent candidates ==\n\n\n=== Libertarian Party ===\nNominee\nLouis A. Garofalo, nominee for state treasurer in 1982\n\n\n=== Concerned Citizens Party ===\nNominee\nJoseph J. Ciccomascolo\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSoon after leaving office in January 1999, both the FBI and SEC began investigating Paul J. Silvester and his close associates due to fundraising irregularities. The State Elections Enforcement Commission determined that Silvester and several of his associates made illegal contributions to Paul Silvester for State Treasurer during his 1998 campaign.\nIncoming State Treasurer Denise L. Nappier discovered a scheme in which Silvester had transferred a significant portion of the State Retirement and Trust Fund into illiquid private equity investments, which disrupted the State's investment strategy and threatened long-term financial stability. Silvester was accused of diverting these funds to specific investment firms in return for kickbacks, primarily coming in the form of no-work consulting and lobbying contracts provided to Silvester and close associates. The scheme was alleged to have netted $2.25 million in false fees and kickbacks.\nIn 2003, Silvester pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 51 months in prison, a lenient sentence as Silvester agreed to cooperate with a larger investigation into racketeering and government corruption. Other convicted individuals included Silvester's brother, Mark Silvester, Assistant State Treasurer George Gomes, former Connecticut Senate Majority Leader William A. DiBella, and Republican nominee for secretary of the state in 1998, Ben Andrews.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Süleyman Yalçın (1926–2016) was a Turkish physician, academic, conservative political figure and journalist who headed a conservative and nationalist think-tank called the Aydınlar Ocağı (Turkish: Intellectuals' Hearth) in the 1970s and 1980s. He was a faculty member at Istanbul University between 1952 and 1988. He is known for his active role in the formulation of the Turkish–Islamic synthesis which has been an influential perspective in the Turkish politics since the 1970s.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Büyükanafartalar, a village of Çanakkale, in 1926. After completing primary and secondary schools in his hometown, he graduated from Kabataş Boys High School in 1944 and from the Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, in 1950.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nYalçın joined his alma mater in 1952 and completed his training in internal medicine in 1957. He became a professor of pathology in 1968. In the early 1960s he was involved in the establishment of the Thinkers Club (Turkish: Aydınlar Kulübü) of which ideology was a synthesis of Turkism and Islamism. The other major members of the group included Arif Nihat Asya, Kemal Ilıcak, Tarık Buğra and Ali Fuat Başgil. Yalçın was elected as the first president of the group.\nYalçın worked at the American universities as a faculty member from 1964 to 1966 and from 1970 to1973. Following his return Yalçın became the chair of Aydınlar Ocağı on 30 January 1974, replacing İbrahim Kafesoğlu in the post. Yalçın was a cofounder of the association which was founded on 14 May 1970. His tenure ended 31 May 1979. Yalçın was elected to the post for a second time on 4 April 1984 and held the post until 29 June !988 when Salih Tuğ was named as the chair of Aydınlar Ocağı. During his second term the association developed a new approach called Turkish–Islamic synthesis which shaped the Turkish right-wing politics for a long time.\nYalçın retired from Istanbul University in 1988. He published articles in various newspapers and magazines, including Büyük Doğu (1956–1959, 1972), Yeni İstiklal (1962–1963), Kök (1981–1982), Boğaziçi (1984–1986), Ortadoğu (1974) and Tercüman (1976–1988). He also published a book entitled Aydınlar Ocağı ve Türk-İslâm sentezi (Turkish: Intellectuals' Hearth and Turkish–Islamic synthesis) in 1988.\n\n\n=== Views ===\nTayfun Atay, a Turkish academic and writer, argued in 2016 that Yalçın's views were the driving force behind the change in the official-ideological orbit of the Turkish state after the military coup of 12 September 1980. Yalçın was also influential in the formation of the intellectual background of nationalist governments just before the coup through Aydınlar Ocağı which he headed. \nYalçın described Turks as \"Muslims who speak Turkish language.\" In an interview with Cumhuriyet in 1988 while serving as the chair of Aydınlar Ocağı he further argued \"Turkishness and Islam have become so inextricably linked over the centuries that when a Turk loses his religion, he loses his Turkish identity.\" He added that even if Turks do not believe in Islam, they must show respect to Islam due to the fact that \"it is the religion of their nation.\" Therefore, for him Islam has a central role in the Turkish identity.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nYalçın was married and had two sons, Sinan and Selim.\nYalçın died of multiple organ failure at Istanbul University's Hospital on 18 December 2016 at the age of 90. He was buried in Büyükanafartalar, Çanakkale, next day after funeral prayers in the Fatih Mosque. The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attended the funeral ceremony and carried his coffin.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA city hospital in Göztepe, Istanbul, was named after him in September 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",

Each match is scheduled for up to two days. The first edition of the competition was held in 2022–23. The tournament sees three teams competing, each representing one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the success of Bangladesh in 2018 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup, plans were going on to establish a two-day red-ball match for women since August 2018. In April 2021, the International Cricket Council awarded permanent women's Test status to Bangladesh women's national cricket team. The lack of a domestic first-class cricket competition for women prevented Bangladesh to start playing Test matches. The 2022–23 edition is the first-ever women's multi-day competition in Bangladesh, launched by the Bangladesh Cricket Board in March 2023. In March 2023, the tournament was inaugurated by the chairman of BCB women's wing Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, at Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna. The competition was introduced to prepare women cricketers for Test cricket and adapt themselves with the longer version.The first edition of the tournament took place from 30 March to 8 April 2023 in a round-robin format. All the matches ended in a draw and thus the championship was clinched by Team Meghna in terms of quotient.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Xie Ping (Chinese: 謝平, born 15 July 1955 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang) is a prominent Chinese financial policymaker. A former senior official of the People's Bank of China and Deputy General Manager of China Investment Corporation, he has more recently been a professor at the PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University. He was the first General Manager of Central Huijin Investment after that entity was established in 2003, while Guo Shuqing was chairman.: 280–281 \n\n\n== Life ==\nXie Ping was admitted to the Department of Economics of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in 1982. After receiving his master's degree there in 1985, he was assigned to work in the Investigation and Research Office of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China (PBC). Nine months later, he entered Renmin University of China to study for a PhD in economics. After graduating in 1988, Xie Ping returned to the PBC where he successively worked in the Comprehensive Planning Department, Interest Rate Savings Management Department, Policy Research Office, and Non-Bank Financial Institutions Department. In May 1997, he was promoted to Director of the Non-Bank Financial Institutions Department, and in November, President and Party Secretary of the PBC branch in Hunan. In August 1998, Xie returned to the PBC head office and served as Director of the Research Bureau and Director of the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China. In October 2003, he became director of the PBC's Financial Stability Bureau.\nIn September 2004, Xie Ping became General Manager of Central Huijin Investment. During his term of office, he actively promoted the restructuring of China's banking and financial system, through which Huijin became a shareholder in major financial institutions. He gained a reputation as a forceful restructurer in cases such as Galaxy Holdings, Everbright Group, Guotai Junan, Shenyin & Wanguo. Xie Ping stated that \"Huijin has no administrative purpose and should exercise shareholder responsibilities as a company and a market participant\".\nIn April 2010, Xie Ping was suddenly dismissed from his post as general manager of Huijin. China Investment Corporation (CIC), by then Huijin's parent company, did not explain the reasons for the removal. Media reported that Xie Ping may have engaged in inappropriate behavior regarding the appointment of directors to financial institutions.\nUpon leaving Central Huijin, Xie Ping was appointed as CIC's deputy chief investment officer, assisting CIC General Manager Gao Xiqing in managing overseas investment business, supervising overseas direct investment projects, and taking charge of the special investment department. He left CIC in September 2015.\nXie Ping has been a prolific contributor to research and debates about China's financial sector. His books include China's Monetary Policy Shifting to a Market Economy (Chinese: 轉向市場經濟的中國貨幣政策), Challenges of China's Monetary Policy in the New Century (Chinese: 新世紀中國貨幣政策的挑戰), and Research on China's Financial Corruption: From Qualitative to Quantitative (Chinese: 中國金融腐敗研究：從定性到定量, co-authored with Chen Lei). In 1996, 2000, and 2003 respectively, these books won the 4th, 9th and 11th iterations of the Economic Science Award named after Sun Yefang, one of China's highest and most prestigious honors in the field of economics. He also received the inaugural Sun Yefang Financial Innovation Award in 2015 for Internet Finance in China: Introduction and Practical Approaches (with Zou Chuanwei and Liu Haier).\nXie Ping also serves as a professor and doctoral supervisor at the PBC School of Finance; an adjunct professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Renmin University of China, Nankai University, Nanjing University, Wuhan University, and other institutions; an editorial board member of the Economic Research journal; and an economics professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In late 2016, he joined the board of trustees for the Public Confidence Committee of Caixin Media.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLiu Hongru\nWang Jianxi\nGuo Shuqing\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "The Azenha Bridge (Portuguese: Ponte da Azenha) is located in the Azenha neighborhood, in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. It is situated on the corner of Azenha and Ipiranga avenues.  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Azenha Bridge was built in 1777 by Francisco Antonio da Silveira, known as Chico da Azenha, an Azorean who arrived in Porto Alegre in the middle of the 18th century. The site, built above the Dilúvio Stream, connected the south to the center of Porto Alegre. The road from the bridge to the historic center became known as the Azenha Way, which today corresponds to João Pessoa and Azenha avenues.\n\n\n=== Ragamuffin War ===\n\nOn the night of September 19, 1835, around two hundred rebels camped in the Azenha neighborhood from Guaíba. Led by Gomes Jardim and Onofre Pires, their aim was to invade Porto Alegre. On the 20th, the revolutionaries entered the city without encountering any opposition. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, president of the Province of São Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul, escaped and traveled to Rio Grande. Without a fight, the revolutionaries asserted their absolute control over the city and gained a lot of support in the interior of the province. The City Council, convened extraordinarily by Bento Gonçalves on September 21, swore in Marciano Pereira Ribeiro, who was fourth in the general order of precedence of the vice-presidents of the province.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\nOn June 29, 2008, the Azenha Bridge reopened after renovation featuring a theatrical presentation of the historic battle between the revolutionaries and the imperials. The show was performed by actors and riders from the Movimento Tradicionalista Gaúcho (MTG) and included a performance by musician Renato Borghetti. The restoration cost R$531,000 and preserved the original features of the bridge, which was painted to prevent graffiti and given a new lighting system. However, the steps leading down to the Dilúvio Stream have been modified to prevent people from occupying the lower part of the bridge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Rio Grande do Sul\nArchitecture of Porto Alegre\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ponte da Azenha at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Paul Mathias Padua (November 15, 1903 - August 22, 1981) was an Austrian-born German painter. He was committed to the tradition of the realist painter Wilhelm Leibl, which was highly valued by Adolf Hitler, and was very successful as an official artist at Nazi Germany.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPadua was born in Salzburg, Austria, but grew up in poor conditions with his grandparents in Geiselhöring and Straubing, in Lower Bavaria. He lost his father at the age of nine. Padua later would move to Murnau and Munich. He abandoned his early academic education to concentrate on his painting. Padua's early work was essentially influenced by Wilhelm Leibl; his later work was increasingly influenced by the New Objectivity. In 1922, he became a member of the Munich Artists' Association. In the following years, his paintings were regularly exhibited. In 1928, he received the Georg-Schicht Prize and in 1930 the Albrecht Dürer Prize, from the city of Nuremberg. In the 1930s, Padua's popularity increased, so that he exhibited in several cities outside the Munich region and in other European countries.\nPadua's focus on traditional art was rather unusual as he had not received any completed academic training. He was recognized as an official artist in Nazi Germany, after 1933. He was represented at the Great German Art Exhibitions, from 1938 to 1944, in the House of German Art, in Munich, with 23 works, including still lifes and female nudes. In 1937 and 1940 he received the Lenbach Prize, from Munich, for portraits. Among those he portrayed were composer Franz Lehár and writer Gerhart Hauptmann. In 1938 he created the fresco painting depicting farmers dressed in the costume of the region of Bavarian Oberland, on the front side of the Weilheimer Hochlandhalle, a livestock auction hall built in 1937/38, which has since then also served as an event hall for the city of Weilheim, and was included as a monument in the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection's, in 2017.\nAt the beginning of the World War II, Padua was drafted into a propaganda company as a war painter. After being slightly wounded during the Western campaign, he was sent back to Germany in May 1940. Until 1943, he painted some of the most famous paintings of German Nazi propaganda art, such as The Führer Speaks, which depicts a family listening to a speech by Adolf Hitler in the radio, and May 10th, 1940, which heroizes the beginning of the Western campaign, and is stylistically inspired on the 19th century Realism. In 1943, Padua was included in the exhibition Young Art in the German Empire, held in the Vienna Künstlerhaus. In 1943, Padua moved to St. Wolfgang, in Austria. In 1944, he was included in the Gottbegnadeten list of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda.\nHe seems not to have been affected by the denazification process in Austria, after 1945. In 1951, Padua settled back in Germany. He acquired a house in Rottach-Egern, from Else Pfeifer. Here in the Tegernsee Valley, he opened his own Gallery by the Lake. He continued his career as a portrait painter. He portrayed personalities such as Friedrich Flick, Helmut Horten, Makarios III, Otto Hahn, Herbert von Karajan and Franz Josef Strauss. Since 1960 onwards, Padua traveled regularly to the fishing town of Nazaré, in Portugal, where he created several paintings, often inspired by the local people.\nHe died of a stroke on August 22, 1981, in Rottach-Egern. Here he was buried in the cemetery at the Protestant Church of the Resurrection.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Saint Ananias Metropolitan of Lakedaemonia (17th or 18th century - April 1764), born as Anastasios Theofilis-Labardis, was a Greek cleric, metropolitan of Lacedaemonia and an ethno-martyr shortly before the Orlovian revolution.\nHe was born at the beginning of the 18th century in Dimitsana in the Peloponnese, taking the common name of Anastasios. His great-grandfather was the noble Stasinos of Akova, who came from the Palaiologos and married Kanella Lampardopoulou from the powerful Lampardis or Lampardopoulos family of Dimitsana. \nHis parents were the granddaughter of the noble Stasinos and Theofilis from Stemnitsa. Ananias was educated at the Filosofou Monastery and before 1741 he was appointed bishop of Karyoupolis in Mani. \nIn 1747 he took over as archbishop of Dimitsani, which was then an independent archdiocese. When in 1750 the metropolitan of Lacedaemonia Parthenios Kalimeris died, Ananias took over this diocese as well. \nAnanias is said to have had a country house near the springs of Lucius, where he presumably went to communicate with his associates. In 1754 he renovated the metropolis of Mystras by building a new metropolitan building at his own expense, as can be seen from an inscription with the epigram below and the date 1754:\n\noukéti dómoi kai pýlai palaífatoi,\nal' Ananíou tou nyn ierarchoúntos\nkai apó váthron neósantos dapánais,\noútinos enenkoúsa teleí i Dimitsána.\n\n\n== Death ==\nThen the vizier of the Peloponnese was the mild-mannered Topal Osuman Pasha against whom other Turkish officials reacted who went to Constantinople and demanded his transfer. The Greek prerogatives sided with the vizier and five of them headed by Ananias also went to Constantinople in 1762. \nTogether with Ananias were Petros Deligiannis, an uncle of Asimakis Zaimis, Krevvatas (grandfather of Panagiotis Krevvatas) and an uncle of Panoutsos, notary public. They succeeded in keeping Topal Osuman Pasha in his position and the death sentence of the agades who moved against him, which revived the morale of the slaves.\nBut after two years, the cruel Hamza Pasha from Karysto was installed as vizier of the Peloponnese in his place, so the fanatical Turks found an opportunity to incriminate Ananias and the other four commissioners and cause the issuance of a secret firman that condemned them to death. \nIn 1764 Deligiannis, Zaimis, Krevvatas and Notaras were hanged who were found in the seat of the vizier in Tripoli, while Ananias was in Mystras. A body of 150 horsemen was sent against him, but Ananias was secretly notified by a special envoy. In the metropolis of Mystras, 20 Maniates and 10 Dimitsanites defended Ananias for 9 days until their supplies were exhausted. \nThus, after 12 were killed, the rest managed to escape while Ananias remained to suffer death. He prayed and received communion of the Immaculate Mysteries and was then beheaded in the temple or in his room. \nThe Turks brought his head to the vizier and his body was buried in Mystras. Along with Ananias, the dragoman he had, as Moragian (first tier of Kocabaṣı), was executed. These happened in April 1764.\nAfter the execution of Ananias, the Turks turned against his relatives and other Christians in order to suppress the movement at his birth. Through the patriarchate they deposed Neophytos Deligiannis, ep. Zarnatas, whose father was Petros Deligiannis who was hanged earlier. The murder of Ananias and the lamentation of his sister Eugeniki, wife of Georgakis Filosofopoulos, is mentioned in the elementary school saved by T. Kandiloros:\n\nEkeí péra ki apópera ki apóxo apó ti chóra,\nekeí kathótan mia xanthí, xanthí kai mavromáta,\ngýrous gyrízei ta floriá, gýrous margaritária.\n- Gia vgál'ta Vgenikoúla mou, ta érma ta trisérma,\nti 'kópsan ton kyr-Ananiá kai to mitropolíti.\n\nThe Orthodox Church honors his memory as a saint on April 15.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Benešov Uplands or Benešov Hills (Czech: Benešovská pahorkatina) are uplands and a geomorphological mesoregion of the Czech Republic. It is located mostly in the Central Bohemian Region. It belongs to the largest mesoregions in the country. It is named after Benešov, which is the most populated town in the territory.\n\n\n== Geomorphology ==\nThe Benešov Uplands is a mesoregion of the Central Bohemian Hills within the Bohemian Massif. It is a rugged hilly area with erosional denudation relief, tectonically disturbed, with distinct structural ridges and inselbergs. The uplands are further subdivided into the microregions of Březnice Uplands and Dobříš Uplands.\nThere are a lot of medium-high hills. The highest peaks are located in the southwestern part of the territory. The highest peaks of the Benešov Uplands are:\n\nStráž, 638 m (2,093 ft)\nPteč, 633 m (2,077 ft)\nHrby, 627 m (2,057 ft)\nŠpalková hora, 620 m (2,030 ft)\nDrahenický vrch, 615 m (2,018 ft)\nLevín, 612 m (2,008 ft)\nVraneč, 608 m (1,995 ft)\nKozí vrch, 603 m (1,978 ft)\nMumlin, 602 m (1,975 ft)\nHolý vrch, 599 m (1,965 ft)\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Benešov Uplands stretches from southwest to northeast. The uplands have an area of 2,410 square kilometres (930 sq mi) and an average elevation of 366 metres (1,201 ft). It is the fourth largest mesoregion in the Czech Republic.\nThe main watercourse is the Vltava River, which flows across the territory from south to north. Several reservoirs built on the Vltava are located in the Benešov Uplands: Orlík, Kamýk, Slapy, Štěchovice and Vrané. The second significant river is the Sázava, which flows from the east until it joins the Vltava.\nSuitable natural conditions contributed to the creation of many settlements in the Benešov Uplands, but there are no large cities. The most populated towns in the territory are Benešov, Dobříš, Sedlčany, Týnec nad Sázavou, Jílové u Prahy, Bystřice, Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, Kostelec nad Černými lesy and Mnichovice.\n\n\n== Geology and pedology ==\nThe geological bedrock is dominated by granites, granodiorites, diorites and orthogneisses. The soils are shallow or medium deep. Stone is quarried in the territory. The area is also historically associated with gold mining.\n\n\n== Protection of nature ==\nDespite the large area of the territory, there are almost no large-scale protected areas. The only exception is a negligible part of the Brdy Protected Landscape Area, which extends to the territory in the west. The most valuable small-scale protected areas are the national nature reserves Ve Studeném and Voděradské bučiny.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMap of Benešov Uplands on mapy.cz",

        "content": "The Military of the Tulunid Emirate (Egyptian Arabic: جيش الإمارة الطولونية, Coptic: Ⲛⲉⲛⲁⲗⲁⲥⲱϯ ⲛ̀ⲑⲱϣ ⲛ̀ⲧⲟⲩⲗⲱⲛⲓⲧ) or the Military of the Tulunid State (جيش الدولة الطولونية), officially known as the al-Asakir al-Masria (العساكر المصرية, Ⲛⲉⲛⲁⲗⲁⲥⲱϯ ⲛ̀ⲣⲉⲙⲛⲕⲏⲙⲓ, lit. 'The Egyptian soldiers') or al-Askar al-Masri (العسكر المصري, lit. 'The Egyptian soldiers') or al-Jund al-Masri (الجند المصري, lit. 'The Egyptian troops'), was the official armed forces of the Tulunid Egyptian Emirate.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter the fall of the Egyptian Ptolemaic Kingdom and the end of the ancient Egyptian civilization at the hands of the Roman Republic, Egypt became a Roman province until the Islamic conquest of Egypt at the hands of Amr ibn al-As in 642. Egypt was ruled by the Umayyads and Abbasids, most of whom were characterized by their mistreatment of the Egyptians, which resulted in many revolutions, the most famous of which were the Bashmurian revolts, in which the Egyptians, whether Muslims or Christians, participated because of the imposition of exorbitant taxes and the preference of the Arabs over the Egyptians.\nAhmad ibn Tulun was appointed governor of Egypt by the Abbasids until he gained independence in 868. He minted the Ahmadi dinar as a symbol of this independence. Thus, the Tulunid Egyptian Emirate was declared and Egypt became an independent state for the first time since its fall at the hands of the Romans. The Tulunid Emirate is one of the independent states from the Abbasid state. The Tulunid state represents the first experience of local rule in which a dynasty or state ruled independently of the central government of the Abbasid state. It was ruled by a number of members of the Tulunid dynasty until the Egyptian Tulunid emirate was ended by the Abbasids.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nAhmad Ibn Tulun was keen to form the first independent army in Egypt in the Middle Ages, strengthen it, and provide it with equipment. A few years later, the number of its members reached one hundred thousand individuals, armed with various types of weapons known in that era. He created a naval fleet to protect the shores of his country, maintain the path of maritime communication, and establish forts. The army embarked on military campaigns until Egypt's territory expanded and they reached the Levant to consolidate their influence and protect their northern borders. The major cities of the Levant, such as Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, and Antioch, entered their possession, and they continued their advance until the city of Raqqa. The Egyptian army was also the first army to pledge allegiance to its Tulunid masters rather than the Abbasids.\nAhmad Ibn Tulun exaggerated in enlarging the size of his army and strengthening it, motivated by the conspiracies, intrigues, and temptations that were being hatched against him in the capital of the Abbasid state, so its number reached one hundred thousand fighters, as previously mentioned. Ahmad Ibn Tulun controlled this huge army based on a well-thought-out and drawn-up policy. He made his officers from among the Turkics close to him. This army was always ready to carry out what was asked of it, and it occupied its members with hard training and suppressing temptations and conquests. It allowed them to gain wealth and gain prestige, and provided them with comfort. He preferred them over himself, and said that they were related to him like children to fathers. Therefore, he lavished on them generously, and payed their salaries on time.\nThere was no revolution during his reign that was attributed to the lack of wages, which his contemporaries were accustomed to. Rather, he would sometimes grant a year's salary as a pure grant to them, so that their hands and hearts would be strong.\nKhumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun went to extremes in spending on the army in terms of uniforms and weapons. He dressed its members in silk caps and brocade gilets, designed belts for them, and adorned them with decorated swords that they placed on their shoulders. This was in line with the luxury that dominated life in his era, which included almost everything. If they walked in front of him and his convoy he arranged each sect with its uniform and weapons, the al-Mukhtara squad (his private squad) first, then the rest of the military, followed by the Blacks.\nKhumarawayh took care of training his army. He assigned each sect its role in fighting, and he lavishly spent money on its members, giving them more than his father had given them. He would give them their gifts on a regular basis, and distribute gifts to them in abundance on every occasion, in addition to the spoils of war that they took as rewards, which made them loyal to the state and bind them to it with a bond based on mutual interest. The army's expenses amounted to nine hundred thousand dinars annually.\nThe status of the army rose as a result of this increased attention, and its soldiers and commanders became a stronger influence than they were in the days of Ahmad Ibn Tulun. Its leaders gained control of the estates, and its sects played a major role in the state's foreign policy, especially in the wars of the Levant and the defense of the emirate. Khumarawayh also took an interest in the naval fleet, and it played an important role in the wars that the Tulunid prince fought in the Levant by supporting land campaigns.\nThe new Egyptian army fought many battles in which it won glorious victories, the most important of which were the Levantine border (al-Thughur al-Shamia) wars against the Byzantines, the sack of Byzantine Thessaloncia, the Battle of Tawahin against the Abbasids, and the war of Mahammad ibn Ali al-Khalanji to restore the Egyptian Tulunid state.\nIn the book “The Army in Egypt in the Tulunid and Ikhshidid Era,” its author, Dr. Faten Mahammad al-Bandari, says that the Egyptian army during those two eras was a force to be reckoned with by the Abbasid state and other powers in the Islamic world and outside it. Rather, it was the strongest Islamic armies at the time. To demonstrate this, the author discusses, in extensive detail, the human structure of this army, its military organizations, the arts of mobilization and fighting as it was relied upon, and finally its weapons and supplies. Ahmad Ibn Tulun was allowed to gain independence in Egypt from the Abbasid state, which was preoccupied with suppressing strife and revolutions and the weakening influence of its caliphs.\nHence, the author says that the personality of Ibn Tulun had a great impact on his wise leadership of the Egyptian army, especially given his military and religious upbringing in Tarsus. But creating the first Egyptian Islamic army independent of the Abbasid state was not an easy task at all. To ensure superiority, and to curb the ambitions of the Byzantines in particular, Ibn Tulun had to prepare and mobilize the army in a completely new way. In this regard, Ibn Tulun himself says: “I endured the great burdens and the heavy supplies by attracting everything described with courage and summoning everything described richly... what I had prepared to surround the state from the dense armies and multiplying armies.”\nAs the author explains, the Egyptian army in that era included Turkic, Maghrebi, Nubian, Byzantine, Arab, and Egyptian elements, but the heaviest of them were the Egyptians, of whom alone there were about 70,000 soldiers. This is in addition to what historical sources mention that Ibn Tulun used some of his Turkic family and appointed them to leadership positions. The Egyptians also had leadership roles, especially in the last phase of the Tulunid state and then the Ikhshidid state.\nRegarding the military organizations during the two states, the author focuses on leadership, recruitment, and the army office. The Tulunids, and after them the Ikhshidids, followed special systems in assuming leadership and carrying out its tasks. The title of “Amir of Jihad” evolved into, in that era, “Army Commander,” “Chief Commander,” “State Manager,” or “Wāli of War.” Leaders were chosen on the basis of possessing qualities and characteristics such as horsemanship, experience, and possessing the characteristics of leadership.\nAs for soldiers and conscription, the author concludes from historical sources that Ibn Tulun came to Egypt accompanied by soldiers with a high degree of training and loyalty. He used them to defeat his opponents and they were the first nucleus of the new army. As a culmination of this strong beginning, Ibn Tulun recruited huge numbers from Sudan, and then large numbers of all elements joined the Egyptian Tulunid army.\nThe author says that the Tulunids and Ikhshidids paid great attention to military reconnaissance and gave it their attention. Military mobilization and the preparation of soldiers to fight were at a high level in the two eras, as the army was mobilized into two parts: cavalry and footmen (infantry), and each of them had its role in the fighting. They also took care of military parades, to show the strength and prestige of the army and impose fear of it inside and outside Egypt.\nThe Egyptian Tulunid and Ikhshidid princes took care of the weapons and equipment used at the time, such as the sword, bow and arrow, spear, pike, catapult, tank, battering ram, ladders, and caltrop, in addition to the safes for weapons, clothing, soldier barracks, supplies, medical and financial supplies, horses and animals, and moral supplies (preachers). When the Ikhshidid state was established in Egypt in 935, it was an extension of the policies of the Tulunid state in managing the army. It was based on controlling it, taking care of its various elements, training them well, and granting them good livelihoods and generous grants.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nAhmad Ibn Tulun's army was 100,000 individuals, divided into 70,000 Egyptians, 25,000 Mamluks (24,000 Turkic and 1,000 blacks), and 7,000 Arab mercenaries. The number of the army increased during the reign of Khumarawayh to 400,000. The number of the Egyptian army during the reign of the Egyptian Prince Mahammad ibn Ali al-Khalanji, after he re-established it after independence again from the Abbasids, was 50 thousand.\nIbn Tulun benefited from the experience he lived in Baghdad of the dominance of the Turkics and their tyranny. He feared that the army would be dominated by one element that would be tyrannical and direct the affairs of the state in its favor. Therefore, he did not draw his soldiers from his Turkic clan so that the strife and intrigues would not spread to Egypt. He also ruled out restricting the entire army to Arabs. In order not to repeat the experience of the Aghlabids, who relied on the Arab element until their history was filled with bitter conflicts. Also, this element lost its military advantage since al-Mu'tasim deprived it of giving, so the Arabs were forced to migrate to the countryside and work in agriculture. For this reason, Ahmad Ibn Tulun decided to diversify the elements of his army from Turkics, Egyptians, blacks, and Arabs.\nAfter the death of Ahmad bin Tulun, Khumarawayh sought to develop the military power of his emirate, increasing the number of army personnel by introducing new elements into its ranks. He brought in new soldiers from Central Asia from the Turkic element, and included with them a group of the country's residents, the Levantines and Egyptians. He doubled the national element in the army, and recruited Arabs residing in the al-Hawf region and other regions inhabited by Arabs known for their courage and bravery. He trained them, organized them, armed them, and formed a squad from them. In particular, he called them al-Mukhtara (المختارة, “The Chosen Ones”), and he took them as his personal guard along with the blacks.\n\n\n=== Cavalry (al-Foorsan /الفرسان) ===\nMost of the cavalry were Turkic.\n\n\n=== Infantry/footmen (al-Rigala /الرجالة) ===\nA large portion of it was Egyptian.\n\n\n=== Archers (al-Nashaboon /النشابون) ===\nIt was largely Nubian.\n\n\n=== Naval fleet (al-Ostool al-Bari /الأسطول البحري) ===\nThe majority of it was Egyptian. The Egyptian Tulunid naval fleet was the nucleus of later Islamic Egyptian naval fleets such as the Ikhshidid, Fatimid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk fleets.\nAhmad Ibn Tulun took care of the naval fleet, the establishment of which came later than the establishment of the land army. The urgent need for the fleet did not become clear until after Ibn Tulun expanded in the Levant and was forced to protect its ports from Byzantine attacks in addition to maintaining the sea route linking the Levant to Egypt. His interest in the naval fleet increased when al-Muwaffaq's desire to seize Egypt from him intensified, and he feared that he would trample it on the side of the Nile, so he began building the al-Jazira fortress and building more ships. He was keenly aware of the value of the fleet to complete its military preparation, and it included one hundred large vessels and one hundred military vessels, in addition to the al-Alabiyat, the al-Hamaim, the al-Ashariyat, the al-Sanadils, and the service boats.\nRegarding the Egyptian fleet in Islamic history, Dr. Mahammad Abdel Latif said: “Egypt contributed a large share in establishing the first Islamic fleets, and the industry was present on Roda Island, in al-Qalzam (currently Suez), and in Alexandria. The activity of the Egyptians was not limited to preparing the Egyptian fleet, but rather the ruler of Egypt would send some Egyptian navigators to work in the Maghreb fleet or the Mashriq fleet and contribute to the general maritime projects of the Islamic State.”\nHe added that the Egyptians had the greatest credit for the greatness of the Islamic Navy, as the Caliphate depended on them to establish its military fleet, explaining that the manufacture of warships in Egypt was a large type called (battleships), of which a ship could hold a thousand men, and a small type called (cruisers), which could accommodate 100 men, and its mission was to move quickly and maneuver around major ships.\nHe explained that the Abbasid state did not hesitate to request the assistance of the Egyptian fleet in the Tulunid era, in order to defend its borders neighboring the Byzantine state, and with the increase in the strength and splendor of the Egyptian fleet in that era, the Byzantine Emperor began trying to become friendly with Ibn Tulun and ask for his appeasement. He even sent a delegation in 878, requesting to conclude peace between the two countries.\n\n\n=== Other sects ===\nal-Hagana, al-Nafatoun (molotov throwers), al-Manjaniqioun (catapult), al-Tabababon (tankers), al-Ayaron, al-Kashafa (scouts), doctors, nurses, engineers.\n\nAl-Rowad (الرواد): They are the plural of Ra'id (رائد), and they are those who frequent the army's landing sites before its arrival.\nAl-Waza (الوزعة): They are the plural of Waz'i (وازع), and they are the ones who straighten the rows while marching.\nAl-So'a (السعاة): They are the plural of Sa'i (ساعي), and they are the ones who carry letters and orders between commanders.\n\n\n== Notable commanders ==\nShafi' al-Lulu’i: Mahammad bin Ali al-Khalanji's comrade.\nMahammad bin Ali al-Khalanji: He was an Egyptian soldier who became independent in Egypt and announced the restoration of the Tulunid state. He succeeded in ruling Egypt for nearly a year until the Abbasids defeated him and returned Egypt to the Abbasid state.\nSafi al-Rumi: Commander of a sect in the army whom Mahammad bin Ali al-Khalanji served under.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMilitary of the Mamluk Sultanate\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Murmansk (Russian: Мурманск) was one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981. It entered service as Imeni XXVI syezda KPSS (Russian: Имени XXVI съезда КПСС) with the Soviet Border Troops. In 1992, it was renamed Irtysh' (Russian: Иртыш) and passed to the Border Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia. The ship was renamed again in 1996 and decommissioned in 2013.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nAll Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe final Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 22 April 1980, launched on 3 July 1981, and delivered on 25 December 1981. The ship was named Imeni XXVI syezda KPSS 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and entered service with the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops in Murmansk.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ship was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and renamed Irtysh after the Irtysh River. In 1996, it was renamed Murmansk after its homeport. \nIn July 2002, Murmansk made visit to Iceland. \nMurmansk was decommissioned in 2013 and broken up in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paola Gassman (29 June 1945 – 9 April 2024) was an Italian actress.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThrough her mother, Nora Ricci, Paola Gassman was a fifth generation actor, as Ricci was the daughter of actors Renzo Ricci and Margherita Bagni.  \nGassman devoted herself almost exclusively to the theater, with the exception of some sporadic but significant television appearances in comedies and scripts. At the beginning of her career she spent three years in the Milan company Teatro Libero, directed by Luca Ronconi. She performed in their show Orlando furioso, which toured in many European countries and in the United States before being adapted into a television series. Also during that period, she performed in the shows La tragedia del avengeratore and Cucina. She then joined the Brignone-Pagliai company, where she performed in Ibsen's Spectra and Fabbri's Family Process.\nGassman was directed by her father, Vittorio Gassman, onstage. With the theatrical company Pagliai-Gassman staged many shows both in the dramatic and in the comic and brilliant genre. She had a long period dedicated to Luigi Pirandello.\nShe also performed in Goldoni's The Liar, Georges Feydeau's The Cat in the Pocket, Svevo's Wedding Scenes, and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream.\nShe acted with directors such as Squarzina, Bolognini, Sciaccaluga, and Ronconi. Her later shows included Miller's Down from Mount Morgan; Crouse's Life with Father; Mary Coyle Chase's Harvey; Iphigenia in Aulis and Helen (both by Euripides); and Viaggio a Venezia and La Bottega del Caffe (both by Goldoni).\nIn recent years with Ugo Pagliai, she dedicated herself to poetry and to all those pieces that are linked to memory and repertoire. In 2007, she published the autobiography A big family behind your back through Marsilio Editori.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nGassman was a companion of the actor Ugo Pagliai, whom she never married, and whom she shared one son: Tommaso. She and her then-husband, actor Luciano Virgilio, had a daughter; Simona Virgilio known at the National Academy of Dramatic Art \"Silvio D'Amico\" (exactly as Paola's parents had done twenty years before). Her father Vittorio Gassman died of a heart attack on her 55th birthday.\nAfter a prolonged illness, Paola Gassman died in Rome on 9 April 2024, at the age of 78.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Dubbing ===\nMargaret Tyzack in The Winter's Tale (1982), directed by Jane Howell.\n\n\n== Radio ==\n\"L'uomo alla moda\", by George Etherege, directed by Carlo Di Stefano, 15 October 1969.\n\"Under two flags\", by Ouida, directed by Ernesto Cortese, 15 episodes, from 29 April to 17 May 1974.\n\"The city and the years\", by Konstantin Fedin, directed by Marcello Aste, 15 episodes, from 3 to 21 November 1975.\n\"Uncle's Dream\", by Fyodor Dostoevsky, directed by Romeo De Baggis, 6 episodes, from 23 to 29 June 1982.\n\n\n== Theatre ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2016 - Vitae, album by Davide Cavuti\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nPaola Gassman at IMDb\nPaola Gassman discography at Discogs",

It is a Gothic Revival church built in 1879, and is the parish church for the parish of New Milverton.\n\n\n== History ==\nSt Mark's was built in the memory of Dame Francis Wheeler who left behind £9,000 towards building a new church at her death. The church was built on the site of an apple orchard given by the granddaughter of Bertie Greatheed.\nThe church was designed by George Gilbert Scott Jr., who produced three designs for the building beginning in 1873 based on his designs for St Agnes in Kennington.  Construction began in 1876 and the church was consecrated on 15 July 1879 by Henry Philpott, Bishop of Worcester.\nThe building was made a Grade II* listed building on 19 November 1953.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe exterior of the church building is made of red brick and features an ashlar belt course, and has plain tile and lead roofing. It was built in the Gothic Revival style. The building plan contains a three-stage west tower, a four-bay nave, and a three-bay chancel.\n\n\n== Vicars ==\nRev Charles Carus-Wilson (1875–1877)\nRev Henry Maud (1877–1890)\nRev Frederick Carus-Wilson (1891–1898)\nRev Edward Archibald Parry (1898–1900)\nRev Bertram Streatfield (1901–1920)\nRev A.

        "content": "The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) is a missionary religious congregation in the Catholic Church. As part of their mission to evangelize the \"abandoned poor\", the Oblates are known for their mission among the Indigenous peoples of Canada, and their historic administration of at least 57 schools within the Canadian Indian residential school system. Some of those schools have been associated with cases of child abuse by Oblate clergy and staff.: 399–452 \nThe OMI founded the University of Ottawa in 1848, then the College of Bytown. Since the University of Ottawa became publicly funded in 1965, Saint Paul University exists as a separate but federated institution with a pontifical charter to grant ecclesiastical degrees and a public charter, through the University of Ottawa, to grant civil degrees. The congregation has been involved in religious and secular publishing, helping to establish a number of church, community, and ethnic newspapers in Canada including Ottawa's francophone daily newspaper Le Droit.\nOMI's Canadian presence is currently administered in three geographic provinces: \n\nNotre-Dame-du-Cap (French), housed at Notre-Dame-du-Cap Basilica in Trois-Rivières, Quebec\nLacombe (English), with offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and Dominican University College in Ottawa, Ontario\nAssumption (Polish), based in Toronto, Ontario.\nAs of July 2019, there were 282 Oblate priests working in Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1841, at the request of Bishop Ignace Bourget, OMI sent its first missionaries to Canada. Arriving first at St-Hilaire in Montérégie, the Oblates then settled in Montreal and Bytown (Ottawa). The Oblates began in parish missions and later, moved to parishes in poor areas. The Oblates expanded to Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Moose Factory, and Fort Albany in James Bay. In 1845, at the request of the Bishop of Saint Boniface, Norbert Provencher, the Oblates went to Red River Colony, Manitoba. This was the beginning of their missions of Western and Northern Canada.\nArriving at the Métis Red River Colony in a birch bark canoe in 1845, Oblate Alexandre-Antonin Taché (1823–1894) was ordained by Bishop Provencher. Taché was elevated to Bishop of Saint Boniface in 1854, a year after Provencher's death. In 1857, Taché selected 13-year-old Louis Riel as a candidate for the priesthood and sent him to study at College de Montreal. After Riel returned in 1857, he became increasingly involved in Métis leadership and led the Red River Rebellion. Taché acted as intermediary between Riel's provisional government and Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald's Cabinet and then worked to establish the terms of the Manitoba Act of 1870, which would join the colony to Canada. After the failure of rebellion, Taché unsuccessfully advocated for Riel's amnesty.\n\nTo facilitate their mission, after his installation as Titular bishop of Ibora in 1890, and ordination as Bishop of Athabaska in 1891, Émile Grouard instructed Oblates to construct of a fleet of steamboats. The Western Canadian steamships of the Oblate Order of Mary Immaculate consisted of at least four boats, including St. Alphonse (built in 1894) and St. Charles (built in 1903). The boats also carried supplies for the North-West Mounted Police and Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== Treaty 11 ===\n\nIn order to receive funding from the Canadian Government for the OMI mission to the Dene people, the area they served needed to be under treaty. From 1909 to 1921, Oblate Gabriel-Joseph-Elie Breynat, Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie and titular Bishop, lobbied and negotiated so that the Dene would have such a treaty but reception from the Canadian government was lukewarm. This changed in 1921 when, driven primarily by desire for rights to newly discovered oil, Duncan Campbell Scott, Superintendent of Indian Affairs approached Breynat for his support to \"insure the success\" of treaty negotiations with the Dene. Known for being part of the negotiations for Treaty 8, Breynat accompanied treaty commissioner, Henry Anthony Conroy, through the negotiations, and witnessed Treaty 11, signing at eight out of nine commission visits across the territory. Conroy noted, \"I was very glad to be accompanied by His Lordship Bishop Breynat, O.M.I., who has considerable influence with the Indians in the North, and would like here to express my appreciation of the help and hospitality accorded to me and my party in his missions...\" Meanwhile, Breynat noted, \"I may say that I am responsible for the treaty having been signed at several places, especially at Fort Simpson.\" The last of the Numbered Treaties, Treaty 11 bound the Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib), Gwichʼin, Sahtu (Hare), and other peoples in the vast 950,000 km2 (370,000 sq mi) area, which would become part of the Northwest Territories and Yukon under the Government of Canada's jurisdiction.\n\n\n=== Order of Canada protest ===\nIn December 2008, representatives of Assumption OMI returned two Order of Canada medals to the office of the Governor General of Canada in protest over the honour being bestowed to Henry Morgentaler, noted Canadian abortion rights advocate. While the medals themselves were returned, the honours, given in 1979 to Oblate Michael J. Smith (1911–2002) for \"his success in integrating war refugees into new surroundings and of his deep concern for the Polish community at large\" and in 1971 to Oblate Anthony Sylla, for his \"dedicated services for over sixty years as an Oblate missionary to immigrant settlers in Western Canada\", are still valid.\n\n\n== Residential school administration (1884–1990) ==\n\nIn 1876, Canada established the Indian Act. To fulfill various treaty obligations to provide education to Indigenous peoples, the Act provided for Indigenous education at day schools built on reserves.\nOblate Vital-Justin Grandin, Bishop of St. Albert advocated for Indigenous children to \"become civilized\" through residential schools.: 159  In 1880, he wrote to Public Works Minister Hector-Louis Langevin, explaining that boarding schools were best to make Indigenous children \"forget the customs, habits & language of their ancestors\".\nIn 1884, the Indian Act was amended to allow the Governor in Council to \"make regulations [committing] children of Indian blood under the age of sixteen years, to such industrial school or boarding school, there to be kept, cared for and educated [until age] eighteen\". The Act was further amended via The Indian Advancement Act, 1884, establishing that the denomination of teachers at reserve schools was determined by the dominant religion already present, but with provision for minority denominations to have a separate school with permission of the Governor in Council. This allowed for churches to establish schools, not based on existing denominational presence, but to fulfil missionary work.\nA primary operator of Canadian Indian residential schools, the OMI maintained at least 57 (41%) of 139 total schools funded by the Government of Canada, including Atlantic Canada's only residential school, the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\nIn 1887, missionary physician, Nicolas Coccola, arrived at the site of the Mission jésuite Saint-Eugène auprès des indiens Kootenai Jesuit mission to the Kootenay of British Columbia and established a residential school (1890) and silver mine (1895).\nIn 1920, the Indian Act was again amended, making it mandatory for all Indigenous children between age seven and sixteen to attend an Indian Residential School. In 1933, principals of residential schools were conferred legal guardianship of the children attending the school via the Act.\n\n\n=== \"Flying school buses\" ===\nOn November 27, 1930, Breynat was a Commercial Airways passenger with the Mother Provincial of the Sisters of Charity (The Grey Nuns) traveling from Fort McMurray to Fort Chipewyan. On landing, the plane struck gasoline cans on the runway and collided into a group of children. Four were killed, five injured, and the RCMP gave aid. In 1937, Breynat purchased a Waco biplane (CF-BDY) to be flown by Louis Bisson .\nIn 1938, \"The Flying Priest\", Oblate Paul Schulte (1896–1975) conducted a medical evacuation from Arctic Bay, transporting Oblate Julien Cochard to Chesterfield Inlet in a Stinson Reliant floatplane.\nJean-Antoine Trocellier, Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie purchased a Noorduyn Norseman bush plane (CF-GTM) in February 1952 and based it in Fort Smith. In 1954, the OMI began taking children to schools from their communities by the \"Artic Wings\" airplane, which resulted in a reduction in police escort records from that period. Oblate William A. Leising shuttled the children to residential schools, calling his plane the \"flying school bus\", picking them up from their communities and landing at Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut, Aklavik, Northwest Territories, and Churchill, Manitoba.\nThe Norseman aircraft operated until 1957 when it was sold and replaced by a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (CF-OMI).\n\n\n=== Revelations, reconciliation, and the contemporary ministry since 1991 ===\nOn March 15, 1991, after its National Meeting on Indian Residential Schools, the Catholic Church recognized that the \"negative experiences in the Residential Schools cannot be considered in isolation from the root causes of the indignities and injustices suffered by aboriginal peoples.\" This was followed by a statement from Oblate Conference of Canada President Douglas Crosby, on July 24, 1991, stating an apology on \"certain aspects\" of its ministry. Noting that the Oblate was soon to celebrate its 150th anniversary of ministering to Native peoples of Canada, Crosby wrote that the OMI recognized that they were a \"key player\" in the \"implementation of cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious imperialism\" that \"threatened the cultural, linguistic, and religious traditions of native peoples\". Crosby also noted that sexual and physical abuse had occurred at the residential schools, and that the instances were \"inexcusable, intolerable, and a betrayal of trust.\" Further, Crosby noted that the OMI renewed its commitment to work with Native peoples in a renewed relationship seeking to \"move past mistakes to a new level of respect and mutuality.\"\nIn 1991, Oblate Hubert O'Connor (1928–2007), Bishop of Prince George was charged with sex crimes and resigned his see. Initially convicted in 1996 of rape and indecent assault on two Indigenous women, O'Connor was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. By affidavit, O'Connor admitted only to consensual relationships with the women, and that he had fathered a child that was placed for adoption. On appeal of the conviction, O'Connor's charges were dismissed. He resigned as bishop in 1991, but retained the honorific of most reverend.\n\n\n=== St. Anne's Indian Residential School ===\nSt. Anne's Indian Residential School was run by the OMI and the Grey Nuns of the Cross through Canadian Government funding from 1902 to 1976. Investigations into allegations of abuse at St. Anne's Residential School began in November 1992. Over seven years, Ontario Provincial Police interviewed approximately 700 survivors and witnesses, collecting approximately 900 statements about abuses at the school from 1941 to 1972. Physical abuse came in many different forms including poor living conditions and corporal punishments for students speaking in their native languages.\n\n\n=== Kamloops Indian Residential School ===\nStarting in 1893 (three years after its inception) until 1977, the Canadian government charged the Oblates of Mary Immaculate with running the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia on the traditional territory of the Secwépemcúl'ecw (Secwepemc). In 1910, the principal said that the government did not provide enough money to properly feed the students. Hundreds of Secwépemcúl'ecw children attended the school, many forcibly removed from their homes following the promulgation of mandatory attendance laws in the 1920s. Peaking at 500 students the 1950s, it became Canada's largest residential school. As a matter of policy, the administration forbade children who attended the school from speaking their native Secwepemctsin language or practicing their traditional spirituality.\nThe indigenous community had long suspected that unmarked graves were located at the residential school, but no proof existed to support this. In 2021, anthropologist Dr. Sarah Beaulieu surveyed the area with ground-penetrating radar and observed \"disruptions in the ground\" which she concluded could be 200 unmarked graves, based on \"their placement, size, depth, and other features\". In July 2021, Beaulieu noted that they should be considered \"probable burials\" or \"targets of interest\" because only with an excavation could they be confirmed as human remains.\nIn a statement released by the First Nations Health Authority, CEO Richard Jock said, \"That this situation exists is sadly not a surprise and illustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities.\"\nRosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc (TteS) said that work was underway to determine whether the Royal British Columbia Museum held relevant records. Plans had been formed for an archeological dig although the idea remained controversial among school survivors, \"with some seeing exhumation as a process that could help lay victims properly to rest, while others want them left undisturbed.\" As of May 2022, debates were ongoing. The RCMP \"E\" Division stated at the time that while it had opened an investigation \"so that we can assist should our assistance be required\", it was \"respect[ing] that Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc remains as the lead official at this time\", and was not looking into the site itself. As of May 2022, no remains had been excavated, leaving the initial claim unverified.\nPremier of British Columbia John Horgan said he was \"horrified and heartbroken\" at the discovery, and that he supported further efforts to bring to \"light the full extent of this loss.\" Highlighting the national importance of the discovery, flags were lowered in communities across Canada. In Halifax, Mayor Mike Savage noted the flag lowering was \"to honour the children found in Kamloops and all others who lost their lives to the residential schools system.\"\nOn May 30, 2021, Ken Thorson of Lacombe OMI issued a media release acknowledging discovery of the children's remains:\n\nOn behalf of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, I wish to express my heartfelt sadness and sincere regret for the deep pain and distress the discovery of the remains of children buried on the grounds of Kamloops Indian Residential School brings to the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation, and other affected Indigenous communities, especially family members of the deceased. I appreciate the sensitive and respectful way in which this difficult work is being carried out. This heart‐breaking discovery brings the tragedy of the residential school system into the light once again and demands that we continue to confront its legacy.\nThe Missionary Oblates were administrators and teachers at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Through our own ongoing reflection, and the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we are growing into a deepening awareness of the damage caused to Indigenous peoples, the enduring harm caused by colonization and the part our religious order played in it through the residential school system.\n\nThis growing awareness leads us to an increased desire to listen deeply and learn from Indigenous communities where Oblates continue to live and minister. The Oblates remain committed to humbly participating in ongoing efforts towards reconciliation and healing for our role in this painful part of our shared history.\nOn May 31, 2021, The University of British Columbia indicated that it would review the honorary degree it had granted to Oblate John Fergus O'Grady (1908–1998), Bishop of Prince George, in 1986. O'Grady had been Principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School in Mission, BC from 1936 to 1939, Kamloops Indian Residential School from 1938 to 1952, and Cariboo Indian Residential School, Williams Lake, BC in 1952.\n\n\n==== Request for government financial help ====\nIn July 2000, OMI Superior, Jean-Paul Isabelle requested government financial help with approximately 2,000 lawsuits related to its residential schools. Noting that Saskatchewan alone had 900 claims, with two settling for $100,000 CDN each, Isabelle feared that the order would go bankrupt in Canada. Fr. Camille Piche said he read the first 500 claims before realizing \"they were all the same.\" \"Unfortunately some of the lawyers simply do carbon copies of them, simply changing the names and the dates. That makes you doubt about the validity of some of them.\" The order spends at least $2,000 to process each claim. In 2006, the Oblates were among the Catholic entities that promised a combined contribution of $25 million to a residential school survivors' compensation fund, of which only $3.9 million was paid before the government of Canada released the Church from its financial obligation in 2015. The Oblates stated that their portion of the settlement, which was not publicly disclosed, was paid in full. As of 2021, the organization was divided into multiple corporations, which hold assets totaling at least $200 million; a 2007 bulletin stated that one advantage of creating new such entities was protection of church assets from financial liabilities associated with lawsuits.\n\n\n==== Alexis Joveneau ====\nBeginning November 2017, specific accusations of physical, sexual, psychological, and financial abuse were levied against Alexis_Joveneau, a missionary of the order stationed at Unamenshipit and in remote Innu communities of Quebec along the St. Lawrence River shore from the 1950s until his death in 1992, were revealed as part of the Canada's National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). Survivors, many children at the time of the events, noted their fear of speaking out against Joveneau, with one saying, \"I could not talk about it; he was like a god.\" Joveneau was also noted for his part in the forced displacement of families from Pakuashipi to Unamenshipit in the 1960s, and deliberate removal of benefits for those that returned.\nIn March 2018, in a statement in response to the testimonies, Oblate Fathers noted they were \"deeply concerned\" following the testimonies and \"fiercely hoped\" that the members of the community would find peace. In March 2018 the order opened a hotline for abuse victims.\nA participant in five National Film Board of Canada (NFB) documentaries from 1960 to 1985, including three by Québécois director Pierre Perrault, Joveneau was a public face of the OMI mission in Canada. The synopsis of the NFB films, including Attiuk (1960), featuring Joveneau have been edited to include note of his alleged abuse.\n\n\n==== Sexual abuse lawsuit ====\nA class-action lawsuit had been launched against the OMI in March 2018. Despite the OMI initially seeking a settlement, as of 2021, the lawsuit had grown to include 190 Indigenous and non-Indigenous persons from Quebec. Allegations include Oblate attempts to \"silence repeated sexual assaults it was well aware of\" and include reference to Oblate Alexis Joveneau, Oblate Raynald Coture, and others.\nIn October 2018, a Radio Canada Enquête investigative report by Quebec journalist Anne Panasuk, unveiled accusations against ten additional Oblate missionaries, including Oblate Raynald Couture, who had served in Wemotaci, an Atikamekw community from 1981 to 1991. After sexual abuse accusations surfaced in the 1980s, Couture was relocated to France by the OMI, and in 2000, after eight Atikamekws filed a formal complaint of sexual assault, Couture was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to 15 months in prison. Couture now admits his crimes, saying that he sought help from the church, but none came. The report included accusations that Oblate Archbishop of Labrador City-Schefferville Peter Sutton was aware of the accusations in 1974. In response to the Enquête report, Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Quebec City thanked Anne Panasuk, stating \"The Church must never again be silent.\"\n\n\n==== Records of the dead ====\nThe Canadian Press reported on June 3, 2021, that the OMI refused to release records that might help identify the remains found at residential schools sites, especially as the discovery of 215 potential remains is contrary to existing reports of 51 children known to have died at the facility. The director of the Residential School History and Dialogue Centre of the University of British Columbia noted that the Government of Canada and churches had been fighting over document access for twenty years. J. Michael Miller, Archbishop of Vancouver, called on all Catholic organizations to be transparent with their archives and noted that the Diocese of Vancouver (distinct from the OMI) provided records to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and they continued to be \"available for review\". On June 4, 2021, Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc Nation also noted that the OMI had yet to release any records about the school. Ken Thorson, Provincial of OMI Lacombe Canada, cited his apology of May 30, saying \"an apology is easy\" but that follow-up was hard. He said that the OMI considered releasing records for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (begun 2007, with submissions closed in 2015), but acknowledged that \"rather than taking a listening stance,\" the congregation \"came together in a defensive posture.\"\n\n\n==== 751 unmarked graves at Marieval ====\nOn June 24, 2021, Chief Cadmus Delorme of Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, announced that searchers using ground-penetrating radar had discovered 751 unmarked graves near the former OMI-run Marieval Indian Residential School (also known as Greyson or Lac Croche / Crooked Lake) site on the Cowessess 73 reserve. The significant find made international headlines, with The Washington Post calling the discovery part of Canada's \"devastating legacy of one of the darkest chapters of its history.\" Donald Bolen, Archbishop of Regina, noted that the discovery \"brings us face to face with the brutal legacy of the Indian Residential School system\". \n\nThe findings in Marieval and Kamloops are part of a larger tragedy. They are a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced – and continue to face – in this country. And together, we must acknowledge this truth, learn from our past, and walk the shared path of reconciliation, so we can build a better future.\nIn 2018, Chief Cadmus Delorme wrote to the Donald Bolen, Archbishop of Regina, asking for funding to restore the Cowessess cemetery. Less than six months later, the adjoining church was destroyed by fire. Work to recover graves began in 2019, when the Cowessess First Nation received $70,000 for the work via part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina's insurance settlement after the fire and it was agreed that the church would not be rebuilt and the land would return to the Cowessess. Work on the cemetery was delayed for over a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in March 2021, Chief Cadmus Delorme announced that the community had begun radar scanning to find remains at the site, and that the end goal was to \"identify, to mark, and to build a monument in honouring and recognizing the bodies.\" From June 2–23, their efforts found the 751 unmarked graves and they marked each with a flag.\n\nThe pain is real, the pain is there and the pain hasn't gone away. As we heal, every Cowessess citizen has a family member in that gravesite. To know there's some unmarked, it continues the pain.\nNoting that the unmarked graves likely included adults, the gravesite had long been said to contain unmarked graves from the local community including some, Chief Cadmus Delorme asserted, where markers were destroyed by church leadership. Donald Bolen, Archbishop of Regina affirmed the community's pain regarding the destruction, illustrating one story where an Oblate priest had destroyed headstones \"in a way that was reprehensible\", echoing RéAnne Letourneau, a Sisters of the Presentation of Mary, who wrote in the 2019 Archdiocese of Regina Annual Report that the diocese had heard reports of a pastor who bulldozed parts of the cemetery 50 years prior because of a conflict with Cowessess leadership. Other accounts cited the 1970 handover, when the Cowessess First Nation took over the cemetery from the church, saying graves were plowed under or destroyed.\n\n\n==== Marieval Indian Residential School ====\nEstablished in 1874, after Treaty 4 at Fort Qu'Appelle was signed and Cowessess 73 reserve formed, OMI's Crooked Lake Mission in the Qu'Appelle Valley began. Led by Oblate Jules Decorby, followed by Oblate Agapit Page, it operated within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface under Oblate Archbishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché. A log building day school for Cowessess children opened in 1885 with Page as principal. Students transferred to the newly built Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School in 1884 and the log building was torn down. Oblate missionaries continued to visit the area from Lebret.\nThirteen years later, OMI presence was a constant in the community, with eleven brothers and 39 priests serving the mission from 1897 to 1967. In 1898, four Sisters of Notre Dame des Missions de Lyon arrived from France to begin a boarding school at Cowessess called the Holy Heart of Mary, however friction with the Oblates resulted in their departure. In 1900 they were replaced first by lay teachers, then the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Hyacinthe in July 1901. The first principal of the school was Oblate Théophile Campeau (1897–1900). When the school was granted federal government funding as a residential school for 40 children in 1901, Oblate Siméon Perreault (1900–1912) was principal.\nIn 1903, Oblate Perreault requested 40 acres of land from the Cowessess for a school and mission and received verbal permission. As formal paperwork was done, Perrault increased the request to 350 acres. The surrender of land was signed in November 1908 under condition that if it ceased use for a school or mission, it would revert to the band.\nIn 1908 the establishment of a post office under the name of \"Marieval\" set the area's official name, and Perreault became its first postmaster—administering Cowessess access to mail. With the exception of Principal Jean-Baptiste Beys (1912–1918), for over 60 years Oblates served as parish priest, principal, and postmaster for the community, including: Gustave Fafard (1918–1920), Joseph Carrière (1920–1933), Placide Châtelain (1933–1938), Vincent de Varennes (1938–1944), Jean Lemire (1944–1952), Regalis (Royal) Carrière (1952–1961), and Gaston (Garry) Gélinas (1961–1964). After Gélinas' resignation in 1964, the postmaster role was filled by the community. Oblates Gérard Nogue (1964–1971) and Adéodat Ruest (1971–1972) were the last Oblate principals at Marieval, as its administration shifted to the government.\n\n\n==== Fort Alexander Indian Residential School ====\nOblate Arthur Masse was arrested on June 16, 2022, charged with indecent assault of a student at OMI-administered Fort Alexander Residential School. The crime was alleged to have been committed between 1968 and 1970 when the student was 10 years old. The arrest of Masse, aged 92, was the culmination of a decade-long RCMP criminal investigation that included over 80 agents, who conducted over 700 interviews and analyzed thousands of historical documents, resulting in 75 statements from witnesses and victims of abuse at the school. Masse was released pending trial on July 20, 2022.\n\n\n== List of Canadian Indian residential schools ==\n\nAs part of its mission in Canada, the OMI ran at least 57 residential schools with locations in seven provinces and territories. During a penitential pilgrimage to Canada in July 2022, Pope Francis reiterated the apologies of the Catholic Church for its role in running those schools, acknowledging the system as genocide.\n\n\n=== British Columbia ===\nOMI residential schools in British Columbia included locations in Cranbrook, Kakawis (Meares Island), Kamloops, North Vancouver, and Williams Lake.\n\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission (1863–1984). Its aim was to bring Indigenous Sto:lo people to a Catholic and agrarian lifestyle. Later, the school became a federally mandated residential school named St. Mary's. Closed in 1984, it was the last residential school in British Columbia. It is now a cultural centre operated by the Sto:lo people. There an operating OMI cemetery on site with graves of priests and nuns dating back to at least 1880.\nKamloops Indian Residential School, Kamloops (1890–1969). Subject of widespread outrage beginning May 26, 2021, after 215 officially undocumented unmarked graves were discovered on the property via ground-penetrating radar, resulting in lowering of flags across the country, a call to examine all former residential school grounds across Canada, and plans to honour the deceased and reunite them with their relatives.\nKootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook (1912–1970)\nLejac Residential School, Fort St. James (1874–1976)\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School, North Vancouver (1899–1958)\nLower Post\nAlexis Creek\nChristie School, Kakawis\nSechelt\n\n\n=== Alberta ===\nOMI residential schools in Alberta included locations in Brocket, Cardston, Cluny, Wabasca (Desmarais), Dunbow (High River), Fort Vermilion, Maskwacis (Hobbema), Joussard, St. Albert, and St. Paul.\n\nLac La Biche Residential School, Lac La Biche (1893–1898)\nErmineskin School, Maskwacis\nCrowfoot School\n\n\n=== Saskatchewan ===\nOMI residential schools in Saskatchewan included locations in Beauval, Delmas, Duck Lake, Lebret, Marieval, Sturgeon Landing, and Onion Lake Cree Nation.\n\nBeauval Indian Residential School, Beauval (1895–1983)\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret (1884–1969)\nSt. Michael, Duck Lake\nOnion Lake\n\n\n=== Manitoba ===\nOMI residential schools in Manitoba included locations in Cross Lake, Sagkeeng First Nation (Fort Alexander), Pine Creek First Nation, The Pas, Sandy Bay, and Winnipeg.\n\nPine Creek School, Camperville\nCross Lake\n\n\n=== Ontario ===\nOMI residential schools in Ontario included locations in Fort Albany First Nation, Fort Frances, McIntosh and Spanish.\n\nSt. Anne's Indian Residential School, Fort Albany (1902–1976)\nSpanish Indian Residential Schools, Spanish (1874–1965)\nSandy Bay School\n\n\n=== Quebec ===\nOMI residential schools in Quebec included locations in Amos, Mashteuiatsh (Pointe-Bleue), and Sept-Îles.\n\n\n=== Nova Scotia ===\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie (February 5, 1930 – June 22, 1967).

        "content": "Alfred George Wathall (30 January 1880, Bulwell – 14 November 1938, Chicago) was an English-born American composer, music arranger, orchestrator, violinist, and music educator. He is best remembered as a composer of operettas of which his most successful were The Sultan of Sulu (1902) and Sinbad the Sailor (1911).  The Sultan of Sulu was staged on Broadway at Wallack's Theatre where it had a successful run in 1902–1903. It used a libretto by George Ade and was produced by Henry W. Savage. He was also a composer of several Christian hymns.\nWathall was educated at Northwestern University School of Music (now Bienen School of Music) where he was a pupil of Peter Lutkin (music theory and composition). A violinist, he later taught on the faculty of that institution as a professor of violin. A longtime resident of Chicago since the age of 12, he was employed as a music arranger and orchestrator for WGN (AM) in Chicago for many years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nDietz, Dan (2022).

        "content": "Dunay (Russian: Дунай) was a Soviet and later Russian icebreaking patrol ship in service with the Soviet Border Troops and later Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. It was one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nAll Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe fifth of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 24 December 1976, launched on 5 August 1977, and delivered on 31 December 1977. The ship was named Dunay after the Danube River and joined the maritime unit of the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Russian Far East after transiting the Northern Sea Route.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Dunay was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.\nIn 1997, Dunay participated in joint exercises with the United States Coast Guard cutter USCGC Storis and made a visit to Kodiak, Alaska.\nDunay was decommissioned on 20 September 2017 and broken up in 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

Carey School of Business at Arizona State University and was previously University Distinguished Professor and the Director of the Center for Environmental and Resource Economic Policy at North Carolina State University.  Smith is known for his foundational research in environmental economics, is a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and was inducted in the National Academy of Sciences in 2004.  Chicago Professor John A. List once described Smith as a \"Renaissance Man of Economics\" in praise of Smith's book The Economics of Environmental Risk.  He has published more than 300 academic works that have been cited over 7,000 times, which includes 15 books and over 200 peer-reviewed articles.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nSmith received his PhD in economics from Rutgers University in 1970.  Following his PhD, he held positions at Bowling Green State University, Resources for the Future, and State University of New York at Binghamton until 1976.  From 1979 to 1983, Smith was Professor of Economics at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and was the Centennial Professor of Economics at Vanderbilt University from 1983 to 1987.\nIn 1987 Smith was hired as University Distinguished Professor at North Carolina State University.  Smith briefly left NC State to serve as Arts and Sciences Professor Of Environmental Economics at Duke University in 1994 before returning to NC State in 1999.  While at NC State, Smith founded the Camp Resources workshop for environmental economics in 1993, which has met annually since its establishment.  Smith left NC State in 2006 to join the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University as an emeritus professor, a position he still holds.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn 2004, Smith was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, one of very few environmental economists to achieve such a recognition.  He was named a fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation and the AAEA.  Smith also received a Distinguished Service Award in 1989 from the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, the leading professional organization for environmental economists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website at Arizona State University",

        "content": "Konstantin Kochiev is an Ossetian diplomat and politician from the partially recognized Caucasian Republic of South Ossetia, which most of the United Nations recognizes as part of Georgia, occupied by Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDuring the Pankisi Gorge crisis in 2002, the Georgian government considered expanding their security region to include South Ossetia, claiming the breakaway territory's security forces where inadequate at protecting it's residents. Kochiev represented South Osseita in talks against this, which the Georgian government agreed to, stating there was no way to include South Ossetia into the security zone without a clash and armed conflict with the separatist government with Kochiev instead suggesting police reform within South Ossetia to stabilize the situation.\nIn 2005 Kochiev was the South Ossetian representative from the Moscow-based \"Forum on Democracy and Multiculturalism in the Euro-East\" which saw representatives from South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Artsakh and Transnistria which denounced the United States, praised Serbia denouncing Kosovo, and called on Russia to invade and annex Georgia. The Forum also denounced the territorial integrity of Georgia as a Soros-backed conspiracy, claimed Moldova was perpetrating a genocide, and that Ukraine's orange revolution was a threat to global democracy.\nIn 2010 Kochiev went on a state visit to the Western Sahara, returning stating that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's Polisario Front has recognized South Ossetia's independence, and that he had made inroads with the Algerian government. In 2015 Kochiev served as State Counsellor to the President of the Republic during the Presidency of Leonid Tibilov. In 2016 Kochiev was on a committee tasked with drafting a new Constitution, alongside Zhanna Zasseeva, Merab Chigoev, Peter Gatikoev, Stanislav Kochiev, Alan Parastaev, and Ilona Khubaeva.\nIn 2017 Kochiev served as State Councilor of the President of the Republic of South Ossetia during the tenure of Anatoliy Bibilov, and received the Order of Friendship in a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Ministry of foreign affairs. He received the award alongside other veterans of the ministry, including; Dmitiy Medoev, the first minister of foreign affairs, Andrey Tskhovrebov, the first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Murat Dzhioev, one of the leading negotiators following the 1991 war, Zaira Valieva, the incumbent Secretariat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Akhsar Dzhioev, the longtime ambassador of South Ossetia to Russia, Alan Pliev, another deputy foreign minister, Sergey Surago, the South Ossetian, the South Ossetian diplomat to Transnistria, and Inga Kochieva, Madina Valieva, Zarina Kochieva, Emma Tibilova, and Irina Tskhovrebova, all counselors in the ministry.\nKochiev is currently serving in the administration of Alan Gagloev as \"Advisor to the President.\" As which, on June 14, 2022, Kochiev held consultations with the Russian government over annexation. The delegation claimed that the USD$500,000 price tag to hold the referendum was the main reason that it hasn't happened yet.\nIn 2023 Kochiev was the South Ossetian representative to the 59th round of the Geneva International Discussions. Kochiev voiced his support for the Geneva platform ahead of the talks in January 2024, however, also used it as a platform to call for an internationally recognized hard boarder within Georgia, a so-called \"state border\" between Georgia and South Ossetia, as well as claiming that Georgia is building it's military up with \"foreign partners\" and such an act was a risk to the South Ossetian \"state.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Initiative is a comprehensive program developed by Volvo Cars in 2019 aimed at addressing gender equality and diversity within the automotive industry. \"E.V.A.\" stands for \"Equal Vehicles for All.\"\n\n\n== Details ==\nThis initiative seeks to address various areas related to gender equality.\n\n\n=== Safety Research ===\nVolvo's Accident Research Team has been collecting real-world collision data since the 1970s where both men and women are represented. By analyzing this data, Volvo aims to understand the specific safety needs of different demographics and incorporate these insights into the development of their vehicles.\n\n\n=== Product Development ===\nThrough the E.V.A. Initiative, Volvo integrates gender-neutral design principles into its product development process. This includes considerations such as ergonomic design, adjustable features, and accessibility features to accommodate a wide range of users. For example, Volvo has developed its side curtain airbags to cover the entire window to protect individuals of smaller stature, particularly women who may be seated lower and closer to the steering wheel.\n\n\n=== Marketing Strategies ===\nThe E.V.A. Initiative extends to Volvo's marketing, where the company aims to promote gender equality and diversity through advertising campaigns. In a global campaign by Forsman & Bodenfors, safety research is available for everyone to download through a digital library.\n\n\n=== Community Engagement ===\nVolvo engages with stakeholders, including customers, advocacy groups, and industry partners, to foster dialogue and collaboration around gender equality and diversity initiatives. Through partnerships and outreach programs, Volvo works to extend the impact of the E.V.A. Initiative to the rest of the automotive industry.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWHIPS (Whiplash Protection System)\nSIPS (Side Impact Protection System)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1218323439,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Letter to the Himyarites was composed by Jacob of Serugh and sent to the Christian community of Najran as they were persecuted by the Jewish monarch Dhu Nuwas (r. 517–530 AD), then-king of the Himyarite Kingdom. Some related compositions were produced during this time period, such as Simeon of Beth Arsham's Letter on the Himyarite Martyrs, although Jacob's letter was addressed directly to that community.\nJacob's letter may be contextualized by the interest of the Miaphysite Church in the kingdoms of Pre-Islamic Arabia and also reflects the wide and non-elite readership that his writings would sometimes draw.\nA Syriac edition of Jacob's letter was published by Gunnar Olinder in 1937. The letter is itemized and sometimes referred to as Letter 18.\n\n\n== Dating ==\nThe exact date of the letter is controversial and ties into controversies surrounding the dating of the Christian persecutions. The persecutions are typically dated between 518 and 523. The traditional date comes from a well-known text known as the Martyrdom of Arethas, which places the persecution as beginning in the year 835 according to the Seleucid era, which corresponds to 523 AD. However, this late-date is challenged by Jacob's Letter, which could not have been composed any later than 521, the year that Jacob himself died. The table of contents in the Book of the Himyarites evinces two main phases of the persecution: while the eighth chapter regards the 523 AD persecution (corresponding to the massacre of Najran), the title of the lost fourth chapter preserved in the table of contents mentions a persecution of Christians as having occurred before this. A council in the city of Ramla also refers to a persecution of Christians in Southern Arabia, either in 519 or 524. A third, even earlier persecution from the second half of the fifth century is also described in the Ethiopic Martyrdom of Azqir.\n\n\n== Content ==\nJacob's letter was structured into five main sections:\n\nA salutation\nA consolation for the persecuted, reminding them of what Jesus Christ had also suffered\nAn exposition of Christology (1/3 of the letter)\nA consolation for the persecuted, combined with eschatological hope\nA valediction\nThe letter opens, in the salutation, as follows:To the chosen athletes, the friends of true victory, the astonishing and the powerful, the servants of God, the truly faithful, our Christian brothers, and the tested confessors, in the city of Najran of the Himyarites, the lowly Jacob, who is from the region of Edessa, the faithful city of the Romans, in Jesus, the light of the gentiles and the hope of the worlds, and the judge of the dead and the living: Peace.Jacob rejoices in the faith of the Christians in Himyar and informs them that the Church is praying for them; for the victory of Christ and the trampling of Satan. Later, the third consolation adjures the Himyarites to compare their present suffering with the glory they will gain in heaven. The present world faces. As such, hope should be placed in the world to come. The exposition of Christology provides a basic outline following that of the Nicene Creed. Jacob asserts equality between the Father and the Son, and then describes the incarnation of Jesus and his virgin birth. Jacob then describes Jesus' affairs on Earth, and then hones in on his crucifixion and resurrection. The Henotikon is quoted several times here, including at the conclusion of this section: \"These wondrous things and these lowly things are of the one hypostasis of the only-begotten Son. For of him are the sufferings and the miraculous feats.\" For Jacob, the Christology of Jesus offers answers to the persecutions that the Himyarites suffer. The consolation after the exposition contains three parts: one focusing on the cosmic battle between God and Satan, a second that distinguishes between the soul and the body, and the third that returns to discussing the cosmic battle, though adding mention of the hope that they will receive their reward from God when the end is brought about.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChristianity in pre-Islamic Arabia\nQuranic studies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDurmaz, Reyhan (2022).

        "content": "StateSide Urbancraft is a vodka company located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that originated as a passion project between two brothers distilling vodka in their basement. The company has expanded to include hard seltzer and hard iced tea as well as bourbon.\n\n\n== History ==\nStateSide Urbancraft started as a passion project by two brothers Matt and Bryan Quigley who, in 2013, while in high-school, decided to start distilling Vodka in their basement out of a homemade still made out of an old keg and chemistry lab equipment. When their father found the homemade still, he thought that the pair where making drugs and kicked them out of the house. The two then landed a distilling fellowship at the Michigan State University and consulting jobs at a polish based distillery before founding their own company in 2015 with the desire to fill the niche of domestic American vodka.\nStateSide Urbancraft vodka is known for it's swing-top bottles, and the fact that each batch is blessed by an in-house rabbi. A portion of all proceeds from StateSide vodka is donated to various progressive causes, such as the Human Rights Campaign and the Michael James Jackson Foundation. StateSide beat out Ketel One and Grey Goose to become the official vodka of the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\nIn 2017 the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board lifted regulations on the sale of liquor in the state, namely allowing liquor companies to sell their product in-house in tasting rooms. In response StateSide Urbancraft promptly opened the Federal Distilling Room next to their distillery. In 2018 StateSide Urbancraft opened it's second ever showroom in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh. That year StateSide reported selling 25,000 cases of vodka, and were expecting the number to double by 2019. During the COVID-19 lockdowns StateSide Urbancraft largely shifted to an online ordering and delivery system, as the state owned wine and spirit stores shut down. The company also shifted to producing hand sanitizer.\nIn 2019 StateSide Urbancraft partnered with Scarpetta Philadelphia, a famous pizzeria in Philadelphia, to start producing vodka infused pizzas. When Ben Simmons was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Boston Celtics in 2022, StateSide Urbancraft offered a promotion where they would give anyone who gave them a Simmons jersey a $25 gift card. The jersey would then be donated to local homeless shelters. StateSide has also filled the niche of \"health-conscious vodka\" blending their vodka with electrolytes, and highlighting it's gluten free nature.\nIn 2023 Men's Journal ranked StateSide as the 6th best cocktail vodka in the United States, comparing it to Tito's.\n\n\n== References ==",

Together they developed a new helmet. The shape of the shell was modeled on structures such as the American PASGT helmet and the German Schubert helmet. The new aramid fabric used significantly improved ballistic properties. Fabric for the production of helmets wz. 2005 supplied by DuPont and Teijin.\nCompared to previous helmet designs, the internal equipment of the helmet has also been changed. As in the case of Schubert's helmet, an insert made of a system of straps and mesh was used. After soldiers' comments, a newer, four-point version of the liner was introduced in 2008.\nIn the years 2023–2025, the Polish Army is to receive nearly 80,000 new wz. 2005 helmets.\n\n\n== Users ==\n Poland\n Ukraine\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHełm wz. 63\nHełm wz. 67\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nHełm bojowy wz. 2005. „Nowa Technika Wojskowa”. 12/2006.

        "content": "Karl Freiherr Haus von Hausen (29 September 1823 – 29 July 1889) was an Austrian noble and civil servant who served as the first Governor of Liechtenstein from 1861 to 1884.\nHausen was born into an Austrian noble family of Franconian origins, which was amalgamated under the title 'von Hausen' by Francis II in 1797.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Austrian civil service ===\nFrom 1845 Hausen worked as an intern in the government of lower Austria. From 1850 to 1854 he was the district administrator of Poysdorf, then Korneuburg from 1854 to 1855. He became head of the district office in Valtice. During this time, he played a role in managing the response to a cholera pandemic in the district. As a result, he was awarded honourary citizenship in Valtice in 1861.\n\n\n=== Governor of Liechtenstein ===\nEarly on in the reign of Johann II he found resurgent calls for a new Liechtenstein constitution and the constitutional council was reformed, which had previously been disbanded in 1852 following the revolution of 1848 in Liechtenstein. In April 1861, Hausen was appointed by Johann II as the first Governor of Liechtenstein. In this position, he acted a mediator between the constitutional council and Johann II, and he also managed to maintain public trust in the government. At first, he created his own draft constitution, but then relented and convinced Johann II to sign the draft proposed by the constitutional council, primarily produced by Karl Schädler. The draft was reviewed by an unknown German legal expert and formed the basis of the 1862 Constitution of Liechtenstein, which was ratified on 26 September. It was heavily inspired by the constitution of Vorarlberg and largely addressed the demands of the revolutionaries in Liechtenstein.Under the new constitution, the position of Governor was formalized and the Landtag of Liechtenstein was formed for the first time. During his time as Governor, together with now President of the Landtag of Liechtenstein Karl Schädler, they wrote several administrative laws including, but not limited to laws regarding school legislation, tax reforms, agricultural reforms and trade union regulations. Under his initiative, the National Bank of Liechtenstein was founded in 1861 and a law was passed establishing autonomy for the municipalities of Liechtenstein in 1864.In addition, during Hausen's time as Governor the Landtag came into political conflict with Johann II, primarily regarding foreign policy. For example, during the Second Schleswig War in 1864 Johann II supported the cause of both Austria and Prussia, whereas the Landtag had protest voted against the use of military force against Denmark. However, no action was taken. Most notably in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 Johann II placed the Liechtenstein military at the disposal of Austria. However, the Landtag had not been consulted regarding the deployment and the war was unpopular among the population, as such it faced resistance from the Landtag. As a result, he promised a loan to the country and refused to have his men fight against other Germans. It was this, in combination to the rising costs of maintaining it, that led to the Liechtenstein military being disbanded in 1868 and the country declaring its permanent neutrality.Hausen was awarded honourary citizenship in Liechtenstein on 8 July 1869 by Johann II by recommendation of the Landtag. He was made a Liechtenstein baron in 1884. Starting from the 1870s, he developed a heart condition which impeded him from his duties, and eventually led to his resignation as Governor on 23 September 1884. He was succeeded by Carl von In der Maur.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nFollowing his resignation as Governor, Hausen moved to Innsbruck. He died on 29 July 1889 in Lindau, aged 65 years old.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHausen married Wilhelmine Beinhauer (9 March 1831 – 25 November 1918), the daughter of an Imperial and Royal Lower Austrian governor family, on 11 April 1850 and they had one daughter together. She later married prominent architect Ignaz Bankó.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlbert Schädler (1906). Karl Freiherr Haus von Hausen (in German). Vol. 6.

        "content": "The São Luís-Teresina Railway (Portuguese: Ferrovia São Luís-Teresina), also known as the EF-225, connects the cities of São Luís (MA) and Teresina (PI), passing through Timon, Caxias, Codó, Timbiras, Coroatá, Pirapemas, Cantanhede, Itapecuru Mirim, Santa Rita, Rosário and Bacabeira, along approximately 454 kilometers.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 19th century, the economy of Maranhão was based on the export of cotton and operated by steamship companies on the Itapecuru River, which bordered the producing regions, such as the municipality of Caxias. São Luís, the capital of Maranhão, had a textile industrial park and required a more efficient form of transportation. As a result, a railway line was planned to link the main cotton-producing center with São Luís and connect the largest urban centers in Maranhão. It should also supply other products, especially babassu, whose oil was beginning to be purchased by Europe.\nDespite the need for a railroad, construction only took place in the 20th century, which contributed to the decline in the cotton economy. In 1895, the line connecting Caxias to the village of Cajazeiras (now Timon), on the banks of the Parnaíba River, was inaugurated. In 1905, Federal Law no. 1329 was passed, ordering the construction of a railroad between São Luís and Caxias. Former President Afonso Pena visited Maranhão, took a trip down the Itapecuru River in the company of the then Governor Benedito Leite, noticed the difficulty of navigation and authorized the construction of the railway.\nThe stretch from São Luís to Caximbos (district of Cantanhede) was opened in 1919 and extended to Caxias in 1920. The Benedito Leite Metallic Bridge over the Mosquitos Strait, linking the Upaon-açu Island to the mainland, was completed in 1928. On March 5, 1921, celebrated as the official inauguration, a train departed from Cajazeiras to Rosário. João Pessoa Station, in the center of São Luís, was inaugurated in 1929. Until 1938, the train came from São Luís and stopped at Timon station, a town near Teresina. In 1938, the tracks reached Teresina after the João Luis Ferreira Metallic Bridge was opened. The first trip between the cities of São Luís and Teresina took place on December 31, 1938. The railroad was incorporated into Rede Ferroviária Federal (RFFSA) in 1957.\nIn São Luís, the railroad is divided into two branches: a 17 kilometers mixed-gauge branch to the Port of Itaqui built in the 1970s, which allows Carajás Railway trains to circulate past the junction at Pombinho Station; and a 14 kilometers branch to the Tirirical district, where the Ferrovia Transnordestina Logística (FTL) Yard is located. The stretch that goes through Campo de Perizes, in Bacabeira, required the removal of its tracks in the process of widening BR-135, to accommodate the central median that separates the two lanes. The new tracks were fixed alongside the widened roadway, completed in 2018.\n\n\n== Privatization ==\n\nIn the 1990s, the lines were transferred to Companhia Ferroviária do Nordeste (CFN), which changed its name to Transnordestina Logística. In 2013, it was divided into Ferrovia Transnordestina Logística (FTL), which is responsible for operating the metric-gauge lines of Malha I; and Transnordestina Logística S.A. (TLSA), responsible for Malha II, with a broad and mixed gauge under construction. Currently, the railroad is mainly used to transport fuel between the Port of Itaqui (São Luís) and Teresina.\n\n\n== Cargo transportation ==\nIn 2012, the Port of Itaqui was responsible for 54.2% of the gasoline and 49.8% of the diesel imported into Brazil. In the same year, 1 million liters of gasoline and 1.3 million liters of diesel oil arrived daily in Teresina, 60% arrives by rail and 40% by road. Every day, 40 wagons with a capacity of 42,000 liters were unloaded in Teresina. In 2014, there were averages of over 1,500 wagons loaded per month, with a total of 712,000 cubic meters in the year.\nIn 2018, the railroad transported cement to São Luís, as well as corrective limestone, clinker, containers and wooden pallets via the junction with the Teresina-Fortaleza Railway, enabling interconnection between the ports of Itaqui (MA), Pecém (CE) and Mucuripe (CE). In the same year, around 742 million liters of fuel were transported by rail. Pulp is transported between the Suzano unit in Imperatriz (MA) and São Luís by Valor da Logística Integrada (VLI) on the North-South Railway (FNS) and the Carajás Railway (EFC). Access to the Port of Itaqui, where Suzano has a warehouse, is handled by Transnordestina Logística. In 2020, this movement reached 9.4 million tons of pulp.\n\n\n== Passenger trains ==\nThere were passenger trains on the line until the 1980s. Most of the stations are in ruins, but some have been preserved by local governments. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe São Luís-Teresina Railway was essential for the people who still live in the valleys of the Itapecuru, Mearim and Pindaré rivers, contributing to Maranhão's economic activity and the cultural formation of the region. It also promoted the supply of raw materials and the transportation of goods for the commerce of the main cities in Maranhão and served to transport a large number of passengers. The João Pessoa Station in São Luís, which housed the railroad's administration and was a point of embarkation and disembarkation until the 1980s until it was transferred to the Tirirical neighborhood, was listed as a historic heritage site in 1986. In November 2020, the Maranhão Railway and Port Museum was inaugurated with the construction of a square in honor of carnival artist Joãosinho Trinta and an exhibition of the Benedito Leite locomotive.\nThe landmark decree for the Teresina Railway Station, which opened in 1926, was published on March 25, 2013, in recognition of the building as a symbol of Brazil's integration process. The measure also provided for the construction of the Citizenship Park and included music and dance schools, a library, a cinema and an amphitheater.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNorth-South Railway\nCarajás Railway\n\n\n== References ==",

Pocasset is also the band of Wampanoag who lived in the settlement.\nThis village site should not be confused with Pocasset, Massachusetts, a census-designated place within the town of Bourne in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, about 50 miles east of this Pocasset. The site of Bourne, Massasschusetts was first a Praying Town settled in 1674, possibly also known as Pispogutt.\n\n\n== Name ==\nPocasset is a Wôpanâak name which translates as \"Where a strait widens out.\" It is also spelled Paugusset, Pocasicke, Pocasett, Pocassitt, Pokeesett, and Powakasick.\nThe band of Wampanoag people associated with Pocasset were also called the Troy Indians, Weetemore Indians, and Fall River Indians.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precontact ===\nThe area is part of the Sapowet Point-Almy Brook Area which contains more than 40 archaeological sites, dating back to 4000 years ago.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nFrom about 1618 to 1630, Corbitant (c. 1595 – 1630) was the chief or sachem of Pocasset.\nIn 1659, the Plymouth Colony purchased Wampanoag lands near Fall River from Wamsutta (c. 1634 – 1662), a Wampanoag sachem, in the \"Freeman's Purchase.\" Wamsutta was the brother of Metacomet (Wampanoag, 1638–1676), also known as King Philip.\nIn the 1670s, Westamore (Wampanoag, c. 1635 – 1676), a sunksqua or woman chief, governed the community. Westamore, also known as Weetamoo, was the daughter of Corbitant and widow of Wamsutta.\nLeading up to the King Philip's War (1675–1676, the Pocasset populations \"were so numerous that her armed men, able to go out upon the war path, were supposed to number three hundred.\" British colonists encroached on Wampanoag land and cleared forests, which reduced local game for subsistence. When war broke out, Westamore sent warriors in support of Metacomet. Her husband at the time, Petonanuit, sided with the English, and his followers became the Fall River Indian settlement.\nA skirmish took place near the village between the Pocasset Wampanoag warriors loyal and English and Fall River Indian volunteers, under the command of Colonel Benjamin Church.\nWestamore drowned in the Tehticut River while fleeing English soldiers in 1676. Immediately after the fighting, the Pocasset Wampanoags fled to Narragansett territory for temporary refuse from the English.\nAfter the battle, the Plymouth Colony allowed the Fall River Indians who fought under Church to settle among the English colonists. In 1679 and 1680, the Colony of New Plymouth bought the \"Pocasset Purchase.\"\n\n\n== Notable Pocasset ==\nCorbitant (c. 1595 – 1630), sachem\nWestamore (c. 1635 – 1676), sunksqua\n\n\n== See also ==\nHazard Farmstead (Joyner Site RI-706), ancient Indigenous site in Rhode Island\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDubuque, Hugo Abelard (1907).

        "content": "The Land's End disaster occurred at Land's End, western Cornwall, England on 6 May 1985. Four pupils from Stoke Poges School drowned after they were swept out to sea. Although the inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure, a following private inquiry by Buckinghamshire County Council was critical of headteacher Alec Askew and teacher Robert Harrington. The disaster prompted the Department of Education and Science's national guidelines for school trips, Safety in Outdoor Education, and the adoption of safety recommendations made by the National Association of Head Teachers.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nOn 6 May 1985, a group of 51 pupils from Stoke Poges County Middle School in Buckinghamshire visited Land's End during a week-long adventure holiday based at the Duporth Holiday Village in Cornwall. 11 pupils, all aged between 10 and 12, scrambled down a cliff path to reach rocks approximately 10 to 15 feet above sea level and remained there for around half an hour playing a game of \"dodge the spray\".\nAlthough sea conditions were calm, a large wave caused by a heavy swell either swept or drenched the pupils. Six of them climbed to safety and the remaining five were swept into the sea. Among them were James Holloway (11), Ricky Lamden (11) and Robert Ankers (12), along with Nicholas Hurst (10), who was also swept away after trying to rescue the others. The sixth pupil, Heather Price (12), was rescued by a parent after being washed into a cleft. She was pulled up to a higher ledge and both of them were subsequently brought to the top of the cliff by helicopter.\nThe four missing children remained unaccounted for by the end of the day, despite a search involving a Royal Navy helicopter, a minesweeper, two lifeboats and a fishing boat. The 7 surviving pupils were taken to West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance to be treated for cold and shock. Price, whose condition was \"stable\", was detained due to head injuries and hypothermia. Only the bodies of Holloway and Ankers were later recovered.\n\n\n== Inquest ==\nQuestions were soon raised by parents as to why the children were allowed onto the rocks, which were usually only frequented by experienced climbers. The school's headteacher, Alec Askew, who was present on the trip, denied negligence and claims the children were unsupervised. He also stated that the party had been given no warning of the dangers, nor were there any notices in place.\nThe inquest was held at the Queen's Hotel in Penzance and opened on 15 July 1985. Survivor Heather Price confirmed that none of the three teachers and two parents responsible for the party that day were present with the group of 11 who wandered below the cliffs, but remained at the top organising a photograph session at the headland's famous signpost. One of the parent-helpers, David Paddison, who rescued Price, claimed that the children had permission to go wherever they wanted on the condition that they follow paths and stay on the clifftop, although at least two of the children stated at the inquest that no instructions were given when they arrived at Land's End.\nBoth Askew and teacher Robert Harrington denied any negligence at the inquest. Harrington stated he was unaware of the cliff path and did not see any children go down it. Askew claimed he did not think the children were in any immediate danger, but had sent a pupil to tell the children to come back up when he became aware they were down there.\nThe jury returned on 19 July with a verdict of death by misadventure. The affected parents described the verdict as \"disappointing\" and called for the school's dismissal of Askew. Askew resigned in the days after the verdict, citing the unwanted media attention he received following the inquest.\n\n\n== Inquiry ==\nBuckinghamshire County Council's private inquiry into the disaster was launched on 4 September 1985 and lasted six days. The resulting 64-page report was published on 11 November 1985 and made 22 proposals for the future organisation and conduct of school trips.\nThe report was critical of the conduct of both headteacher Alec Askew and teacher Robert Harrington. It found that Askew's \"preparation and planning for the visit was inadequate and, in a number of ways, seriously unsatisfactory\", and noted he \"failed to organise sufficient supervision and failed to act when he saw the children in danger\". In light of the findings, Harrington resigned.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe disaster subsequently prompted the Department of Education and Science's national guidelines for school trips, Safety in Outdoor Education, which was published in 1989. It also resulted in the widespread adoption by the UK's education authorities of new safety recommendations made by the National Association of Head Teachers.\nDuring 1985, in response to recommendations made at the inquest, six noticeboards were installed at Land's End to warn visitors of the \"natural hazards and potential danger[s]\" of the cliffs and sea.\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Mersey class lifeboat The Four Boys, which was based at the Sennen Cove station, was named in memory of the pupils who lost their lives. It was first launched on 28 November 1991 and a naming and dedication ceremony was held on 22 April 1992, with Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, officiating. The families of the four victims, along with residents of Stoke Poges and other communities in South Buckinghamshire, raised approximately £100,000 towards the boat's £450,000 cost.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLyme Bay canoeing disaster\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anadyr (Russian: Анадырь) was one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981. Laid down as Dnepr (Russian: Днепр), the ship served under the Soviet Border Troops as Imeni XXV syezda KPSS (Russian: Имени XXV съезда КПСС) until 1992 and afterwards under the Border Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia until 2015.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nAll Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe fourth of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 16 July 1975, launched on 14 February 1976, and delivered on 30 September 1976. Laid down as Dnepr after the Dnepr River, the ship was renamed Imeni XXV syezda KPSS to commemorate the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The ship entered service with the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops and sailed to its home port, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Russian Far East, through the Northern Sea Route.\nIn September 1983, Imeni XXV syezda KPSS participated in the search of survivors from Korean Air Lines Flight 007 that had been shot down by Soviet Air Forces.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ship was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and was renamed Anadyr after town of the same name in the Russian Arctic. \nIn 1994, Anadyr visited made a visit to Juneau, Alaska. \nAnadyr was decommissioned on 3 November 2015 and broken up in 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

The album is sung entirely in English, as was the band's first album Acqua Fragile, but it also received a release in the United States which was unusual for an album by an Italian progressive group.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDag Erik Asbjørnsen in Scented gardens of the mind compared Acqua Fragile's sound to Genesis, Yes and Crosby, Stills & Nash, combining Lanzetti's nasal voice with \"majestic guitar licks\" and three-part vocal harmonies. \nAugusto Croce in Italian prog commented that the album was similar to their first, but with slightly better production. Jerry Lucky in The progressive rock files said: \"Sounds like early Genesis. Two LPs [Acqua Fragile and Mass Media Stars] produced by PFM and it shows in their sound.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nBernardo Lanzetti: vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, 8-string guitar\nGino Campanini: electric guitar, mandolin, vocals\nPiero Canavera: drums, percussion, acoustic guitar, vocals\nFranz Dondi: bass\nMaurizio Mori: keyboards\n\n\n=== Others ===\nGaetano Ria: engineer\nClaudio Fabi and PFM: producers\nGuido Harari: design, photography\nBernardo Lanzetti: lyrics\nPiero Canavera: music\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\nDiscogs lists 23 versions of Mass Media Stars including two unofficial (bootleg) versions. Versions have been released on LP, CD, cassette and 8-track cartridge from 1974 to 2021, starting with the original LP (SMRL 6150) and cassette (RIK 76150) versions released by Dischi in 1974.\n\n\n== Plagiarism ==\nIn 2018 Bernardo Lanzetti and Acqua Fragile accused the rapper Busta Rhymes of plagiarism because in \"Genesis\", the song that gives the title to his 2001 album, he used a sampling of \"Cosmic Mind Affair\", taken from Mass Media Stars, without declaring it and indeed attributing it to himself.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMass Media Stars at AllMusic\nMass Media Stars at Discogs (list of releases)\nMass Media Stars at Prog Archives\nMass Media Stars at YouTube\nAcqua Fragile at Italian Prog website",

        "content": "Acqua Fragile is the eponymous first album by the Italian progressive rock band Acqua Fragile. The album was released by Numero Uno in 1973. The album is notable for being one of the very few Italian progressive rock albums sung entirely in English.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDag Erik Asbjørnsen in Scented gardens of the mind compared Acqua Fragile's sound to Genesis, Yes and Crosby, Stills & Nash, combining Lanzetti's nasal voice with \"majestic guitar licks\" and three-part vocal harmonies. Francesco Mirenzi in Rock progessivo italiano commented that the album \"... is noted for the good cohesion of the compositions, close to the most peaceful moments of Gentle Giant.\"\nAugusto Croce in Italian prog said: \"A good album with nice west-coast multi-vocal influences mixed with an English prog sound.\" Jerry Lucky in The progressive rock files said: \"Sounds like early Genesis. Two LPs [Acqua Fragile and Mass Media Stars] produced by PFM and it shows in their sound.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nBernardo Lanzetti: vocals, guitar\nGino Campanini: electric guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals\nPiero Canavera: drums, acoustic guitar, vocals\nFranz Dondi: bass\nMaurizio Mori: keyboards, vocals\n\n\n=== Others ===\nGaetano Ria: engineer\nClaudio Fabi and PFM: producers\nBernardo Lanzetti: lyrics\nPiero Canavera: music\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAcqua Fragile at AllMusic\nAcqua Fragile at Discogs (list of releases)\nAcqua Fragile at MusicBrainz\nAcqua Fragile at Prog Archives\nAcqua Fragile at YouTube\nAcqua Fragile at Italian Prog website",

        "content": "Dara Viravong Kanlagna or Dara Viravong; Douangchampa (born 1940) is a Lao writer. She was involved with work that led to the creation of the Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKanlagna was born in Laos in 1940. Her father, Sila Viravong, was a prominent Lao scholar who designed the flag of the country. He had fourteen children and three children, Douangdeuane Bounyavong, Dara Viravong and Pakian Viravong are prominent Laotian writers.\nKanlagna had been interested in literature since early childhood. She started her career as a schoolteacher in 1958 and began to write around the same time. Few years later she became an editor at Phainam Magazine, and she also began to translate literature books. After the revolution in 1975, Dara Kanlagna worked at the Ministry of Culture as a translator, editor and writer. In 1979 she established Vannasin, a literary magazine, together with other leading Lao writers. Much of her time was dedicated to working with the Preservation of Lao Manuscripts Programme that ran from 1988 to 1994 with support from the Toyota Foundation, and from 1992 to 2004 with support from the German government. Subsequently, this programme led to the establishment of the Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts which today makes images of over 12,000 manuscript texts from across Laos accessible online. In 1996 Dara Kanlagna was awarded the Nikkei Asia Prize for Culture and Community for her passionate work with the manuscripts project.\nAfter her retirement in 2001 she continued to write, focusing on issues in society. Her themes include the role of women in society and education, the struggles and obstacles that Lao women face, and inequalities which are often a result of ancient traditions and poverty. To raise awareness about the tradition of weaving and the fact that textile production is an important industry run and led by women in Laos, Kanlagna teamed up with members of the Group for Promotion of Art and Lao Textiles, all experienced female weavers, to record their stories and research into practices and techniques of weaving and dyeing not only of the Lao, but also of ethnic minority groups. The project resulted in the book Pha phae ni mi tamnan / Legends in the Weaving.\nDuangchampa's prize-winning poetry book collection, Hak dok… chung bok ma, was published in 2005.\nFor her collection of poems with the title Hak dok... chung bok ma (Vientiane, 2005) Dara Kanlagna received the Southeast Asia Write Award in 2010. She wrote the poems in honour of her mother, who raised her and her thirteen siblings with great patience and determination amid hardship and poverty and provided them with a good education despite being illiterate herself.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was compiled by Frang Bardhi, an Albanian Catholic bishop, lexicographer, and writer, and was published in 1635.\nThe Latin Epiriote Dictionary consists of Latin definitions for Albanian words, providing a valuable resource for scholars and linguists interested in the early development of the Albanian language. The dictionary covers a wide range of words, including everyday life, religion, and culture.\nFrang Bardhi's Latin Epiriote Dictionary played a critical role in preserving and standardizing the Albanian language during a time when it faced challenges from foreign influences. By providing Latin definitions for Albanian words, the dictionary helped to establish a written form of the language and contributed to its cultural and linguistic identity.\nThe Latin Epiriote Dictionary remains an important historical document in the study of the Albanian language (Albanology) and its development.\n\n\n== References ==",

The competition consisted of 12 finalists and a local secondary school student, On-uma Worasiri, was named the winner. Thammaphan lost the license to another local organizer, Kanyapat Ngadeesa-nguannam (กัญภัส งาดีสงวนนาม), in 2018.The pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\nWinner gallery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Songkhla's annual editions since 2017.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National Competition ==\nThe following is a list of Songkhla representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Songkhla at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

        "content": "Eugen Eisenhut (27 November 1906 – 21 November 1978) was a German geologist and ornithologist. He produced geological maps of Swabia and in his travels also researched the birdlife.\nEisenhut was born in Hochberg am Neckar, the youngest of three children of a pastor. The family moved to Geradstetten where he grew up where he had long hikes into the countryside and even to school. He studied at the Latin school in Schorndorff (1916–1921) and went to secondary school at Göppingen before interning at an engineering workshop. He completed his schooling in 1927 and went to Stuttgart where he wished to work in engineering but the events of 1933 came in the way as he had been a member of a free socialist student group. He met the theology professor Albrecht Ströle and then found employment at the bird observatory in Radolfzell. In 1934 he was arrested in Mettnau on suspicions of treason by the Gestapo. He was held in prison for a few months but let off due to lack of evidence and he continued to work at the bird observatory until it was shutdown in 1935. He then worked as a bird taxidermist at the Tübingen Zoological Institute and then as an assistant in the geology department until 1942. He studied and received a doctorate in geology on stratigraphy and tectonics from the University of Tübingen and joined the Elwerath Petroleum Works Union company near Hanover and then to China. He returned to Germany and joined the geological department of the Württemberg Statistical Office where he worked until 1971. Eisenhut was involved in mapping the geology of the Swabian region at a scale of 1:25,000. At the same time he also kept his interests in ornithology and published on the biology of the sparrow and the influence of the level of lake Constance on bird populations.\nEisenhut married Margarete Münsinger in 1942 and they had two daughters. After his retirement he lived in a small house in Korntal.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aysberg (Russian: Айсберг, lit. 'iceberg') was a Soviet and later Russian icebreaking patrol ship in service with the Soviet Border Troops and later Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. It was one of eight Project 97P patrol ships built by Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad in 1973–1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union began developing a new diesel-electric icebreaker design based on the 1942-built steam-powered icebreaker Eisbär to meet the needs of both civilian and naval operators. Built in various configurations until the early 1980s, the Project 97 icebreakers and their derivatives became the largest and longest-running class of icebreakers and icebreaking vessels built in the world.\nThe patrol ship variant, Project 97P (Russian: 97П), was developed as a response to the renewed interest of the Soviet Navy and Soviet Border Troops on icebreaking patrol vessels after United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers began appearing more frequently near the country's northern maritime borders. New icebreaking patrol vessels were needed because existing Soviet naval vessels could not operate in ice-covered waters and large icebreakers, in addition to being unarmed and operated by civilians, could not be distracted from their primary mission of escorting merchant ships.\nProject 97P patrol ships are 70 metres (230 ft) long overall and have a beam of 18.1 metres (59 ft). Fully laden, the vessels draw 6.5 metres (21.3 ft) of water and have a displacement of 3,710 tonnes (3,650 long tons). Their three 1,800-horsepower (1,300 kW) 10-cylinder 13D100 two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engines are coupled to generators that power electric propulsion motors driving two propellers in the stern. In addition to being slightly bigger than the icebreakers they are based on, Project 97P lacks the bow propeller and features a bigger deckhouse built of aluminum-magnesium alloy to reduce weight as well as a helideck capable of receiving Kamov Ka-25 or Ka-27 helicopters.\nAll Project 97P patrol ships were initially armed with a twin 76 mm AK-726 deck gun and two 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, but the ships operated by the navy were later disarmed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe second of eight Project 97P patrol ships was laid down at Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad on 17 October 1973, launched on 27 April 1974, and delivered on 25 December 1974. The ship was named Aysberg after the Russian word for \"iceberg\" and joined the maritime unit of the maritime unit of the KGB Border Troops in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Russian Far East where the ship sailed through the Northern Sea Route.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Aysberg was passed over to the Coast Guard of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Shortly afterwards, Aysberg made a visit to Kodiak, Alaska in 1993.\nAysberg was decommissioned on 20 June 2006 and broken up shortly afterwards.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mikołaj Skrzetuski of the Jastrzębiec coat of arms (born around 1610, died 1673) was a nobleman from Greater Poland, a colonel, and the prototype of Jan Skrzetuski, a character in Henryk Sienkiewicz's With Fire and Sword. He was a cavalry soldier who gained fame in battles but also got into conflict with the law. He became known in history for his escape from the besieged Zbarazh and delivering a letter to King John II Casimir Vasa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSkrzetuski came from a poor noble family from Rożnówo near Poznań, bearing the Jastrzębiec coat of arms. He was the son of Jan and Katarzyna Szczutowski. After Jan's death, his widow married a nobleman named Mikołaj Kłodzyński.\nMikołaj Skrzetuski inherited a part of the Rożnówo village near Oborniki from his father, but he gave it to his sister, Marianna Poniatowska, and as a poor nobleman, he enlisted with his relatives in the ranks of the army in Ukraine. The first mention of Skrzetuski, dated 30 November 1634, comes from Lviv city records. This mention suggests that he joined the army through relatives from the Belz Voivodeship. His relatives lived in the vicinity of Belz, a small town between Lviv and Zamość. The Red Ruthenia became his second homeland. In the past, he found refuge both in Dołhobyczów and with his sister in the Poznań region.\nHe led a wandering life, participating in wars, spending his free time with his sister in Greater Poland or with relatives near Belz. After his death, he was buried in the church of the Discalced Carmelites in Poznań. It is assumed that he died before 24 October 1673, as on that day Skrzetuski's will (drawn up by him in 1671) was brought to the city of Poznań.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nAfter the outbreak of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, Skrzetuski served in the armoured companion under the command of rittmaster Marek Gdeszyński; he was his right-hand man. In 1649, he took part in the siege of Zbarazh. Just after a few days, the defenders began to lack food and drinking water (the Cossacks were throwing the bodies of the fallen into the water). The defenders had no illusions about the possibility of long-lasting defense, so they decided to inform the king about their situation and ask for help. Several people were sent to deliver letters written in French to the king, sewn into their clothes. They were captured; one of them was beheaded, the other had their eyes gouged out and their hands cut off. Despite this, Skrzetuski volunteered and, disguised as a peasant, escaped from the besieged Zbarazh. The date of leaving the camp is unknown, as well as the route he took. Skrzetuski had to travel about 46 kilometers before reaching the king. On August 7, he reached John II Casimir Vasa. Skrzetuski achieved this feat thanks to his experience, physical condition, knowledge of the Ruthenian language, and Cossack customs. He informed the king that the defenders only had enough food for six days.\nThe Chancellor rewarded Skrzetuski with a horse with a bridle, 100 ducats, and clothes. The king also promised him one of the nearest vacancies. He probably meant some county office, a small crown land, or a starostwo, but Skrzetuski never sought it, and there is no indication that the promised reward ever reached him. Thanks to his feat, Skrzetuski went down in history.\nRittmaster Marek Gdeszyński was shot on 15 August 1649, and died shortly afterward. After his death, the companion ceased to exist. Skrzetuski became a commander at a lower level – it was the lesser-known \"command over Wołoszcza\". In 1651, Skrzetuski probably fought at Berestechko. On May 29, a month before the battle, he was sent on reconnaissance and captured five Cossacks, who testified that Chmielnicki had been in Zolochiv the previous day. Then there is no information about Skrzetuski for eight years. Wiesław Majewski suggests that between 1652 and 1657, he served as a lieutenant of cavalry in wars against the Cossacks, Tatars, Moscow, and Swedes.\nThe next mention comes from 1660 when Stefan Czarniecki's division returned from a successful overseas expedition, during which they supported their Danish ally. Skrzetuski was named a lieutenant of the light (Tatar) company of the starosta of Osiek, Adam Uriel Czarnkowski. He commanded this unit during wars with the Russian Empire and the Tatars under the command of Stefan Czarniecki, and later John Sobieski. In the first half of May 1660, during the Russo-Polish War, he was sent with a raid against Ivan Khovansky. Near the village of Konstantynów, he captured an enemy companion and prisoners. The information obtained from the prisoners allowed Czarniecki to move towards Slonim and capture it. Skrzetuski defeated the Russian detachment near Piaski, and on May 17, in Vawkavysk, he captured the banner of the Belarusian gentry commanded by Hieronim Horski. In the retreat over the Narew river, he suffered a defeat. He probably also participated in the battles of Połonka (June 28) and Basia river (12 October 1660).\nIn late November 1662, the Confederates murdered their superior, Hetman Wincenty Gosiewski. Skrzetuski did not participate in the murder, but played a significant role in those events, appearing as a colonel of the confederate forces. This crime shook public opinion. His subordinates committed numerous robberies. Despite this, Skrzetuski's authority grew, and soon he was mentioned in sources as a lieutenant of a cavalry company. In 1667, he was mentioned as a vice-rittmaster. After Czarniecki's death, Skrzetuski was associated with Sobieski. From the mid-1667, there is a mention that Skrzetuski brought several prisoners with significant information about the enemy.\nOn 16 August 1671, Skrzetuski distinguished himself in the battle of Bar, as mentioned in several sources. Skrzetuski commanded several hundred soldiers, while the enemy had one and a half thousand. He captured nine Tatars and several Cossacks. He was a respected raider, indispensable in seeking \"language\".\nUntil 1671/1672, Skrzetuski served as a lieutenant, but due to his experience, he was entrusted with the command of larger cavalry formations. In 1672, he found himself in the king's entourage, his importance increased, and he became a rittmaster of the Royal Cavalry. He received a letter of commendation to recruit a Cossack company. He formed a cavalry company from both Greater Poland voivodeships: Kalisz and Poznań, and prepared for the Battle of Khotyn, which took place on 11 November 1673. The company took part in the battle, but probably without its commander.\nDespite his merits to the country, and moreover, his long military service, he did not make a great career, did not acquire lucrative stewardships, or receive a land office.\n\n\n== Lawsuits and court judgments ==\nThe first mention of Skrzetuski is associated with an incident. On Sunday, after St. Andrew's Day, 30 November 1634, he was spending time in one of the taverns in Chwastów (Chwastów – Nowy Wereszczyn) with Pobiatyński, a royal infantry rittmaster. On their way back to the castle, they got into a fight, initiated by whom is unknown; it is only known that Skrzetuski \"chopped\" his companion and \"left him without thinking of help\". He left him half-dead by the roadside. Pobiatyński lodged a complaint against Skrzetuski with the district court in Lviv.\nThe next judicial source is dated 19 May 1663, when he and his soldiers received a lawsuit before the Lublin Tribunal for the murder of the hetman. On June 15, during a default trial, he was sentenced to exile, and his subordinates to infamy and death penalty. On 31 March 1664, due to requisitions in royal villages, he was sued by the tribunal. Skrzetuski was then on the Moscow front, so he did not appear in Lublin. The tribunal sentenced all the accused to eternal exile. On 12 May 1666, the Lublin Tribunal sentenced Skrzetuski and four other officers to infamy for robberies they committed in December 1665 in the town of Bazaliia and nearby farms.\nIn 1667, he attempted to marry Zofia Zawadzka of Belz by force, who a week after the attack became the wife of Jan Wilczkowski, the steward of Kyiv. On 22 August 1667, an agreement was concluded in Lviv, according to which the injured parties were to receive compensation for damages in cash, and Skrzetuski voluntarily agreed to serve a two-week prison sentence in the tower of Lviv Castle. In 1668, the Lublin Tribunal sentenced him to infamy for the attack on the house of Zofia Zawadzka. At the end of his life, several court judgments hung over him. The punishment was not carried out because he remained under the jurisdiction of the hetman.\n\n\n== Legend ==\nSkrzetuski's feat at Zbarazh became part of history, celebrated in poetic works, letters from the front, and memoirs (including those of Jakub Łoś and Samuel Twardowski). However, the hero was generally mentioned without his full name, and his surname was distorted, making the identification of the correct Skrzetuski difficult. Kazimierz Ceypler wrote about Mikołaj Skrzetuski in a poem dedicated to the Skrzetuski family in 1701. The precise name and surname are provided in judicial sources. Papal nuncio Cosmas de Torres called him a Ruthenian and a Skrzetunowski schismatic. Historian Wawrzyniec Jan Rudawski wrote in the late 17th century and referred to him as Jan Skrzetuski, mistaking him for a royal secretary bearing that name and surname. This version was adopted by Henryk Sienkiewicz, thus creating the literary character of \"Jan Skrzetuski\" in With Fire and Sword. In the 1930s, Olgierd Górka claimed that Skrzetuski was an Orthodox Cossack. Zygmunt Lasocki, based on archival research, proved that Skrzetuski's name was Mikołaj.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHundert, Zbigniew (2014). \"Jak Mikołaj Skrzetuski został rotmistrzem pancernym, czyli kilka uwag o ostatnich latach służby wojskowej pierwowzoru bohatera \"Trylogii\"\".

        "content": "The Ethiopic Alexander Romance, also known as the Ethiopic Pseudo-Callisthenes or the Zēnā Eskender (\"History of Alexander the Great\"), is the work of an anonymous Christian and is the most important version of the Alexander Romance in the Geʽez language and the Ethiopian tradition. It was translated in the fourteenth century from an Arabic version of the Romance, which itself was translated from the earlier Syriac Alexander Romance. Although it originates from these sources, it does not follow their three-book structure. The text retains the essential plot from earlier romances, and is a witness to common motifs of Alexander such as his horns.\nAlexander the Great was first introduced into Ethiopic translation from the translations of the Bible into Ge'ez in the fifth and sixth centuries, as Alexander is indirectly alluded to in the Book of Daniel. Furthermore, Alexander is explicitly mentioned in a deuterocanonical text known as the Books of the Maccabees. The Ethiopic Alexander tradition would continue to grow after the creation of the Ethiopic Alexander Romance, such as with the continued translation of the Arabic works on Alexander Al-Makīn and Abū Shākir. In total, eight such works, including the Romance, are known. Kotar divides them into two main clases of texts: one where legend surrounds a historical stratum, and one that is purely fabulous. Kotar places the Ethiopic Alexander Romance into the former category.\n\n\n== Religious influences ==\nThe text begins with a typical Arabic prayer to God asking for mercy and help in telling the story. Following the designation originating from the Quran, Alexander is often referred to by the title Dhu al-Qarnayn ('The Two-Horned One'). Likewise, from Muslim tradition Alexander's association with Khidr is retained. The text also contains many Christianizing elements however (as opposed to a bare translation of the Arabic text), pointing to a Christian authorship of the text. For example, a Christianized Aristotle serves as his counsellor and he eventually converts to Christianity and proclaims the Trinity: \"His Persons being three, and His Godhead one.\" He later inscribes Christian prophecies onto pillars in the city of Alexandria (who he captures in this text as opposed to founds in earlier versions of the romance).\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe text is known from one nineteenth-century manuscript discovered from the treasury of Tewodros II. After the military defeat of Tewodros II to the British Empire, the British came to possess his manuscripts in which they (re)discovered the Ethiopic Alexander Romance. The manuscript has been itemized as British Museum Oriental 826ff. 2a–147a. No variant readings are known.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe only critical edition of the text, including an English translation, is the work of E.A. Wallis Budge published in 1896. It was published in two volumes: the Ethiopic text in the first volume, and the English translation in the second. It was reprinted in 1968. The work was funded by Lady Meux of Theobalds Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlexander the Great in Arabic tradition\nQissat al-Iskandar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKotar, Peter (2011). \"The Ethiopic Alexander Romance\".

        "content": "Naša žena (Slovene: Our Woman) was a monthly women's magazine based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The magazine was the first publication addressing women in the  Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia which was in circulation between 1941 and 2015.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nNaša žena was established in 1941 as a newsletter of the Women's Antifascist Front of Montenegro and Boka (WAF). It was edited by the members of the WAF Central Committee. It became a clandestine publication in the period of World War II, and Mara Rupena Osolnik began to serve as its editor-in-chief in 1943. Following the end of the war it was published by the state agencies on a monthly basis. The magazine was based in Titograd (now Podgorica in Montenegro) in the 1960s.One of its initial goals was to reinforce the socialist struggle for women's equality and to publish articles on female employment and their family life. During the communist era Naša žena reinforced the state ideology of socialist women who should be both modern and economically productive. Therefore, it supported a model of women as a working mother and a wife. The magazine presented tips for them in regard to the fulfillment of these roles all at once. It encouraged similar role models for women in the 1990s. The magazine also serialized literary work, including John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat in 1979.From its start to late 1980s Naša žena was the most influential publication targeting both families and rural and urban women in Slovenia. In a 1969 study it was concluded that 33.3% of Slovenians who read print media were the readers of the magazine.Naša žena folded in 2015.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tongchuan Church, formerly known as Tongchuan Meeting House, Santai Meeting House or Gospel Church, is a Protestant church building situated on Jiefang Lower Street (lit. 'Liberation Lower Street') in Santai, a county under the administration of the city of Mianyang, Sichuan. Founded in 1900 by the British Quaker mission, Friends' Foreign Mission Association, as their meeting house, the church has been subjected to the control of the state-sanctioned Chinese Three-Self Patriotic Church since 1954.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTongchuan Prefecture, as Santai County was known during the imperial era, was the first place visited by Robert John and Mary Jane Davidson, a missionary couple of the Friends' Foreign Mission Association (FFMA), after arriving in Sichuan in 1887. They stayed in the home of a local Muslim, while trying to rent premises to establish mission stations. Their mission efforts were hindered due to the opposition of the local magistrate. After two years of vain negotiations, they had no choice but to turn to Chongqing, the only place which seemed open to them.\n\nIn 1899, Isaac Mason and his mission group were appointed by FFMA to live at Tongchuan, where they took up residence early in 1900. They opened a dispensary and held meetings for worship in a very dilapidated chapel made out of unused small rooms. Mason founded the first Friends meeting house at High Well Street (now Back North Street), which was later transferred along with the mission station to a place called Xiaowan (lit. 'Little Creek'). They subsequently opened a girls' school and a hospital, in addition to an already established boys' school. In 1921, the church was expanded to include four wooden buildings, covering an area of 210 square metres, nine attached houses totaling more than 300 square metres, and a small wooden building designed in Western style.\nTongchuan Monthly Meeting became the largest mission branch of FFMA's Northern District, governing four towns under the administration of Tongchuan Prefecture (Lingxing, Jingfu, Anju, Qiulin), and member churches of nine counties in other administrative regions (including Yanting, Yulongzhen, Shehongxian and its seat Taihochen). According to the statistics provided in 1944 by Republican-era Tongchuan Government, there were 278 local converts consisting of 195 men and 83 women. By the time of the communists' takeover of Sichuan in December 1949, only the three congregations in Tongchuan city centre, Lingxing and Jingfu were still active.\nIn 1954, the communist authorities established the Three-Self Patriotic Church and forced all Christian denominations to sever ties with overseas churches. Tongchuan Meeting House has since been subjected to the control of the Three-Self Church. In 1989, the original church building was completely demolished in the name of \"demolition of dilapidated buildings\", and was replaced by a new building. It is now used as the headquarters of Santai Three-Self Patriotic Association.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonthly meeting\nGospel Church, Mianyang\nTrinity Church, Langzhong — a former Anglican church in Sichuan with similar architectural style\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nDavidson, Robert J.; Mason, Isaac (1905).

The promotion is noted by their rudimentary production setup that consists of a wrestling ring made from mud, surrounded by nylon ropes held together by bamboo posts. The promotion gained international attention when All Elite Wrestling's Will Ospreay and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Jordynne Grace made donations to a GoFundMe fundraiser aimed at providing it a standard wrestling ring as well as additional operating funds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSoft Ground Wrestling on Twitter\nSoft Ground Wrestling's channel on YouTube",

        "content": "The National Stance Movement (Kurdish: ڕەوتی هەڵوێستی نیشتیمانی, romanized: Rewtî Helwêstî Nîştimanî, abbreviated as Halwest) is a political party in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. It was founded on 19 March 2024 with a congress held in Silêmanî. The party includes former members of the Gorran Movement, among them the party leader Ali Hama Saleh, as well as of the National Coalition. The party was also joined by disgruntled teachers who have been protesting the repeated failure by authorities to pay their salaries over the last few years. It intends to run at the 2024 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election.\nAt the founding conference, Ali Hama Saleh was elected as leader of the new party. Apart from Saleh, the party's executive committee consists of Bedel Berwarî, Rêbwar Kerîm Mehmûd, Xalib Mihemed, Karwan Hama Saleh, Xanzad Mihemed, Serdar Qadir, Selîm Koyî and Mamosta Fûad. After the conference, Saleh said that the goals of the party are not just to participate in elections and that the attempts to prevent the regional election from taking place could lead the region into a \"very dark tunnel\".\nFor the 2024 election, the party submitted a list containing 62 candidates, most of whom are running in Silêmanî Governorate. Draw Media also reported, that there was internal conflict at the foundational conference and that prominent founding members like Yûsif Mihemed and Mesûd Ebdulxaliq withdrew.\n\n\n== Positions and statements ==\nOn 2 April 2024, the party released a statement supporting the linking of the salaries of public servants' salaries to the Iraqi salary system, at the expense of the authority of the Government of Kurdistan Region. It explained this position with the failure of the regional authorities to provide these monthly salaries on time and criticized that the ruling parties would have used the salaries as a political card to apply pressure. The party also said that this shift of responsibilities would not weaken the Kurdistan Region but instead that the region has been weakened by corruption, partisanship in institutions like the Peshmerga and the prevention of clean elections.\nAccording to Herş Ebdulrehman, one of the members of the party, the aim is to combat nepotism and corruption in the Kurdistan Region and not to go the same way as the Gorran Movement which he sees as part of the political parties that \"suck the blood of this nation\". The aim is also to create a united front of dissidents. He claims that the party doesn't want its candidates to use the parliament as a source of livelihood and self-enrichment and says that those who become candidates within the National Stance Movement have their own capital and businesses. He also characterizes those who founded the party as the \"voice of the protest against oppression of the ruling parties\", who defended themselves against the oppression of freedom of expression, including the assassination of journalists, over the last three decades.\n\n\n== Prominent party members ==\nThe party leader Ali Hama Saleh was a MP of the Gorran Movement well known for his economic expertise and his criticism of the Kurdistan Region government's policies regarding oil and income. For his concise breakdowns of alleged corrupt deals over land, benefits and oil, also on his own show on the newschannel KNN, he became known as \"The Calculator\".\nAmong other former Gorran members who joined the new party are the prominent personalities Serdar Qadir, Xalib Mihemed, Behar Mehmûd and Daban Mihemed.\nThe National Stance Movement also was joined by Islamist personalities like Selîm Koyî, a former leading figure within the Kurdistan Justice Group, who had argued for a united opposition front between his party and the Gorran Movement in 2018. Koyî is part of the party's executive committee.\nFurthermore, prominent formerly independent politicians and activists joined the party. Among them is Bedel Berwarî, a teacher and protest organizer from Duhok, who was arrested in May 2020 without warrant or explanation why he was arrested and where he was taken to by local security forces. Later this month, he was released on bail for protesting without permission, despite having had applied to the local authorities in time.\nOn 21 October 2021, after spending over a year behind bars without conviction, he was found guilty by an Erbil court for breaching a law about inciting violence and planning violent protests. However, as the time he had already spent in pre-trial detention was longer than the actual sentence, he was released that day. Independent observers also noted, that the court presented no evidence for Berwarî actually planning a violent protest. Another formerly independent figure in the National Stance Movement is Rêbwar Kerîm Mehmûd, a politician from Silêmanî.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Armed Boat Company was a seagoing Loyalist military unit, with a strong black presence, operating as an amphibious raiding force out of New York City during the Whaleboat War. It was raised in 1781 and disbanded after the British evacuation of New York in November 1783.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the British occupation of New York City in 1776, Long Island was used as a supply base. Supplies were brought to the coast of the island and shipped by sea to the city. Patriot amphibious forces in whaleboats attacked supply vessels at sea and supply warehouses on land; but also plundered the local population, who during the war largely consisted of loyalist refugees. The British had organized three battalions for the defense of Long Island, but two of these were sent to Georgia in 1778. In spite of repeated protests in 1780 and 1781, by the British commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton, the Royal Navy allocated far too few ships to be able to effectively prevent the attacks.\n\n\n== Formation ==\n\nThe Armed Boat Company was organized in 1781 under a warrant issued by the Commander in Chief of the British Army in America, authorizing William Luce, a New Jersey loyalist, to raise one company of able bodied men employed in whaleboats and other armed vessels. The term of enlistment was two years or, if required,  until the end of the war; with the same pay as marines serving on armed vessels of the Quartermaster-General's Department. The men were to be clothed and armed and serve under the same regulations as His Majesty's Provincial Forces. The Company served until British evacuation of New York City in November 1783.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Armed Boat Company was originally to have one captain, four lieutenants, eight mates and 92 privates. In 1782 its strength was increased to 125 men. A return from 1783 shows that the company had 81 officers and other ranks; of which one captain, six mates and 50 privates at the East River boat yard, and one lieutenant, two mates and 21 privates at Fort Knyphausen. Many of its members were recruited in Essex County, New Jersey. Several members of the company were former slaves. During an operation in 1782, the Company contained 40 blacks and 40 whites.\nCaptain William Luce, the officer entrusted with organizing the company was soon captured by the Patriots. His replacement was Captain Nathanael Hubbel.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Armed Boat Company was created as an amphibious raiding force with its base in New York City. Its primary mission was to attack and demoralize Continental troops along the shores of New Jersey and Connecticut, including destruction of military and civilian stores and property. Another important mission was to combat Patriot amphibious forces that raided British-held Long Island and Patriot privateers that operated against British merchant shipping during the Whaleboat War.\nThe Company participated in engagements on the Hudson River at Tappan Zee, on August 21, 1781; at Woodbridge, New Jersey on December 21, 1781; and off Elizabethtown Point, New Jersey on March 10, 1782. On January 8, 1782, the Company joined about 300 British regulars in attacking Patriot whaleboats at New Brunswick, New Jersey. Black and white troops from the Company landed at Forked River on June 5, 1782, burning the saltworks and confiscating private property.\nThe company was also involved in the attack on Toms River, New Jersey, a Patriot whaleboat base and the locality of important saltworks, on March 23, 1782. Together with 40 Associated Loyalists  took the Patriot blockhouse and most of its garrison after a bloody struggle with several killed and wounded. Among the prisoners were a Patriot captain, Joshua Huddy, who was handed over to Captain Richard Lippencot of the Associators, in order to exchange him for an Associator captain who had been captured a week earlier. At that occasion, an Associator taken prisoner by the Patriots had either been murdered or killed while trying to escape. As a retaliation, Captain Lippencott killed his Patriot counterpart on the Jersey Shore, which lead to George Washington threatened with revenge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Cited literature ===\nAllen, Thomas B. & Braisted, Todd W.

        "content": "PHL 5038AB (or just PHL 5038) is a binary system consisting out of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf on a wide orbit. The system is 240 light years (74 parsec) distant from earth.\nThe white dwarf PHL 5038A was discovered in 2006 in data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the brown dwarf companion was discovered in 2009 from UKIDSS infrared excess and confirmed with Gemini North to be a spacially resolved binary. It was only the fourth known brown dwarf to orbit a white dwarf at the time. The others were GD 165B, WD 0137-349B and GD 1400B.\n\n\n== Physical parameters ==\nThe white dwarf was first classified as a DA white dwarf, which indicates a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere without any metal pollution. A later work found weak pollution due to calcium in the atmosphere of the white dwarf thanks to XSHOOTER spectra from the Very Large Telescope. The calcium is detected as the K-line in two spectra. No infrared excess due to a disk was detected. PHL 5038A has either accreted all debris or is surrounded by a thin disk. The mass and temperature was also overestimated in the past and later works found a mass of around 0.53 to 0.57 M☉, an effective temperature of around 7500 to 7800 Kelvin and a surface gravity of around 7.9 dex. The progenitor main-sequence star had a mass of around 1.07 M☉ and it existed for around 9 billion years until it became an AGB star and around 1 billion years ago it became a white dwarf.The brown dwarf has a spectral type of around L8-L9. Its mass was initially estimated to be 60 MJ, but this mass was likely an underestimate and more recent estimates find a mass of around 0.070 M☉ (or 73 MJ) and an effective temperature of 1425 K.The same team that discovered the metal pollution of the white dwarf also re-observed the system with Gemini North to determine the orbital parameters. The semi-major axis is 66+12−24 astronomical units and the inclination is 132 ±11°. The eccentricity is unconstrained, but likely lower than 0.615. In the past the white dwarf was more massive, making the semi-major axis half as large at 33 AU.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nCasewell et al. suggest the following evolution of the system:\nThe PHL 5038 system during the main-sequence had a star with a mass similar or more massive than the sun and it had a brown dwarf at an orbit of 33 AU, similar to the orbital distance of Neptune. It also likely had rocky debris in the form of planetesimals in orbit around the star, maybe similar to the asteroid belt. At the end of its lifetime the star became an AGB star with a size smaller than 2.5 AU, leaving the rocky debris mostly intact. As the star lost around half of its mass, the orbit of the brown dwarf and the planetesimals increased. The debris would be stable within 17-32 AU (circular orbit of the brown dwarf) or 5-8 AU (e=0.6 for the brown dwarf orbit). A debris belt with an increased size might be close to the edge of this stable zone and gravitational interactions with the brown dwarf would scatter planetesimals into all kinds of directions, eroding the edge of the debris belt. Some of these planetesimals will be scattered inwards and are being disrupted by the tidal forces of the white dwarf, leading to the pollution of the white dwarf atmosphere. Alternatively the disk could have been larger than the stable zone, resulting in chaotic scattering at the beginning of the white dwarf stage, until the scattering decreased.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nikki Tran is a Vietnamese American chef specializing in Vietnamese-Cajun \"Viejun\" fusion cuisine. Born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Tran owns Kậu Ba in Houston and Kậu Ba Quán in Ho Chi Minh City. Her interpretation of Vietnamese cuisine draws on Cajun influences from her time in Houston, including a Cajun crawfish boil using freshwater prawns. Tran was featured in the TV series Ugly Delicious and Somebody Feed Phil.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTran moved to Houston in the 2000s, where she worked as a \"manufacturing technician at a chip provider\". While living in Houston, she was introduced to Vietnamese-Cajun crawfish, which she decided she wanted to introduce to Ho Chi Minh City.\nTran opened Kậu Ba in 2013, without any professional culinary experience. On the restaurant's opening night, the chef she hired did not show, and Tran took over the kitchen herself.\nIn 2018, Tran opened a second restaurant in Houston, Kau Ba Kitchen in Montrose.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Tran returned to Vietnam to care for her parents. She returned to Houston in 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rabbi Acha bar Hanina was an Israeli rabbi of the third generation of Amoraim who lived in the 4th century). His name appears many times in the Babylonian Talmud, and a few times in the Jerusalem Talmud.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis father, Rabbi Chanina, is mentioned several times in rabbinic literature. His mother was the sister (or possibly daughter) of Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachum.\nOriginally he lived in the south of Israel, probably in Lod. In several places the Talmud says, \"When Rabbi Acha bar Chanina came from the south,\" presumably to the Sanhedrin which sat in Tiberias. He brought with him teachings of other rabbis who lived in the south, such as of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who was a resident of Lod.\nIn Tiberias he studied under Rabbi Assi, and received the teachings of Rabbi Johanan bar Nappaha from him. His friend was Rabbi Jacob bar Idi. The Talmud records a debate between them about the meaning of \"afflictions of love.\"\nIt seems he was poor, as it is said that he went to the market wearing patched shoes. He praised one who studies Torah despite economic pressures, and those who did not rely on the merit of his ancestors for food.\nIt seems that he emigrated to Babylon which is why his teachings appear more frequently in the Bablyonian Talmud. The Talmud records a discussion between Rabbi Acha and Rav Pappa who was one of the leading rabbis in Babylon. Though there are variant texts of this exchange.\nHis father, Rabbi Chanina is sometimes referred to in relation to his son, \"Rabbi Chanina, father of Rabbi Acha.\" His uncle, his mother's brother (or according to another version, his mother's father) was a sage called Shmuel bar Nachum, who was considered an expert in Aggadah.\nRabbi Judah bar Titus taught teachings in the name of Rabbi Acha.\nMost of his teachings are in matters of Aggadah or bringing sources from the Bible to support Halakhic statements.\n\n\n== Teachings ==\nA promise for a good attribute never came out of the mouth of the Holy One, blessed is He, and was changed to become bad, except for once.\nAnyone who says: This teaching is pleasant but this is not pleasant, loses the fortune of Torah.\nAnyone who visits an ill person takes from him one-sixtieth of his pain.\nThe World-to-Come is not like this world. In this world, for good news one recites: 'Blessed…Who is good and does good, and over bad news one recites: Blessed…the true Judge.' In the World-to-Come one will always recite: 'Blessed…Who is good and does good.'\n\n\n== References ==",

The interstices are about the same width as the bands. No axial threads can be distinguished in the interstices. The spire is conical, less than half the height of the shell. The shell contains five whorls, each whorl distinctly angled above. The suture is deep and canaliculate. The aperture is narrowly oval. The columella shows a large fold near the top. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFossils of this marine species have been found in Cretaceous strata near Wangaloa, New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMaxwell, P.

        "content": "Willie, West and McGinty was a British comedy act who performed in music halls and in American vaudeville.  The act was developed in the early 1900s by English comedians Bill Briscoe (William Briscoe; 25 December 1885 – 3 May 1949) and Frank Crossley (Frank Marsh Crossley; 1 January 1879 – 5 November 1942).  Augmented by family members and other performers, it continued into the 1950s.  They were billed under various guises, such as \"The House Wreckers\", \"The Comedy Builders\", and \"A Billion Building Blunders\".\n\n\n== History ==\nCrossley was born in Newton Heath, Manchester, England, and Briscoe in Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland.  Briscoe initially worked as an acrobat in the comic duo of Wild and West, but in the early 1900s he began working with Crossley, as the duo Willie West (with no comma) and McGinty.  They initially intended to work together as acrobats, but while en route to perform in Australia instead decided to perform a slapstick comedy act as a pair of incompetent carpenters or builders.   When they returned to Lancashire, a third (unnamed) performer joined the act, and was later replaced by Rue Corré (Rupert William Herbert Corri, 17 July 1895, Whitby, Yorkshire – 9 December 1979, Miami, Florida).  The name of the act was subtly changed by the inclusion of a comma, to indicate that there were now three performers, with Corré as \"Willie\", Briscoe as \"West\", and Crossley as \"McGinty\".\nThe trio's knockabout comedy involved three builders constructing a house, in which everything went wrong.  They would clumsily hit each other with planks of wood, buckets of water or cement would fall on them, ladders would break, and so on.  The props (constructed from such materials as balsa wood, cardboard and flour) would be manipulated awkwardly, with disastrous results.  The act was carried out with perfect timing; the performers would generally act as though nothing was wrong, ignore their audience, and resume their tasks.\nThe act became highly popular on vaudeville and variety stages in the 1910s and 1920s, performing in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1923 and at the Hippodrome in 1924.  They played at the prestigious Palace Theatre several times, and toured widely, in the U.S. and elsewhere, while often returning to Britain.  There were several changes of personnel, with Briscoe's son Billy West Jr. (William Joseph Briscoe; 31 May 1909, Waddington, Lancashire –  20 June 1971, Bradford, New Hampshire), and Crossley's son Frank Crossley Jr. (Frank Hamilton Crossley; 5 September 1907, Manchester  –  21 July 1994, Fort Myers, Florida) often performing as alternates or replacements from the late 1920s.  \nThe group continued to be successful into the 1930s, and toured worldwide.  In 1930, they performed their act in the short film Plastered, directed for Paramount Pictures by Norman Taurog, and in several other shorts including Cheaper to Rent (1931) and One On the House (1937), as well as cameos in The Big Broadcast of 1936 and Beautiful but Broke (1944).  They featured in Billy Rose's Aquacade show at the New York World's Fair in 1939, and in the 1944 Olsen and Johnson revue, Laffing Room Only.\nThe act's founders, Briscoe and Crossley, both died in the 1940s: Crossley in 1942 in Radcliffe, Lancashire, England; and Briscoe in 1949 in Bradford, New Hampshire, U.S..  Their sons continued with the act, with Ted Corradine (1889–1975) acting as McGinty from the early 1940s, and Donald Keith being the third member of the act in the 1950s.  The act appeared in several shows on television in the 1950s, including The Colgate Comedy Hour and The Ed Sullivan Show, and also performed in live shows at the Palace Theatre, at fairs, in Judy Garland's International Variety Show, and elsewhere.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWillie, West and McGinty at IMDb",

        "content": "Too Much Fun is an album by the American musician C. J. Chenier, released in 1995. He is credited with his backing band, the Red Hot Louisiana Band. It was his first album for Alligator Records. Chenier supported it with a North American tour. The first single was \"Man Smart, Woman Smarter\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Chenier and Bruce Iglauer. It was recorded over a week, the longest amount of time that Chenier had spent working on an album; his main concern was ensuring that all the songs sounded different, rather than employing the same zydeco tempo. Chenier played alto saxophone as well as accordion. The Memphis Horns and Vasti Jackson contributed to the album. \"Zydeco Cha Cha\", \"Louisiana Two Step\", and \"You Used to Call Me\" were written by Chenier's father, Clifton. \"Down Home Blues\" is a cover of the song made famous by Z. Z. Hill.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Washington Post wrote that the album is \"an arousing example of how zydeco's polyrhythms can benefit from the ballad conventions and horn charts of Memphis soul.\" The Telegram & Gazette said that \"Chenier's singing is as impressive as the band's playing, with his voice carrying the rich resonance of a pure bluesman.\" The Chicago Tribune concluded that \"much of the music comes off as zydeco-peppered blues rather than freshly- seasoned zydeco.\"\nThe Record determined that \"Chenier's flamboyant accordion-playing is complemented by his smooth, soulful baritone voice and a superb backing band.\" The Journal & Courier opined that the \"reigning crown prince of zydeco delivers the instant party record of the season.\" The Associated Press stated that Too Much Fun \"works better than most studio zydeco albums.\"\nAllMusic noted that \"it would be unthinkable in the zydeco tradition to have too much fun without dancing being on the agenda, so dance tunes rule the record.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Erwin Nick Hiebert (May 27, 1919 – November 28, 2012) was a Canadian-American physical chemist and professor of the history of science. He was the president of the History of Science Society for a two-year term from 1973 to 1974.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nErwin N. Hiebert, whose father was a Mennonite minister, was born in Waldheim, Saskatchewan and grew up in an urban Mennonite community in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He went to high school in Winnipeg and financed his own college education by working during summers on Mennonite farms in Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. He attended Tabor College in Hillsboro, Kansas for two years and then transferred to Bethel College in North Newton, Kansas. There he graduated in 1941 with a B.A. degree in chemistry and mathematics. In 1943 he graduated with an M.A. in chemistry and physics from the University of Kansas at Lawrence. He met Elfrieda Franz (1921–2012) while they both attended Tabor College and they married in 1943. Soon after their marriage, the couple moved to Whiting, Indiana, where Erwin Hiebert became employed as a research chemist for a corporate laboratory of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana under the jurisdiction of the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratories as part of the Manhattan Project. He worked for the Standard Oil Company until 1946. From 1946 to 1947, he held the position of Assistant to the Chief of the Scientific Branch of the United States Department of War's General Staff in Washington, DC. From 1947 to 1950 he worked as a research chemist at the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, where he graduated in 1949 with an M.Sc. in physical chemistry. At the University of Chicago, he was inspired by Alexander Koyré and Farrington Daniels to study the history of science. In 1954 Erwin Hiebert graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison with Ph.D. consisting of double major in the history of science and in physical chemistry. During his years of study for his Ph.D., he worked from 1952 to 1954 as an assistant professor of chemistry at San Francisco State College. As a postdoc, he was from 1954 to 1955 a Fulbright Lecturer at the Max-Planck-Institut in Göttingen. By 1955, Erwin and Elfrieda Hiebert had three children, with the eldest born in 1948.Erwin Hiebert was from 1955 to 1957 an instructor in the history of science at Harvard University. From 1957 to 1970 the Hiebert family lived in Madison, Wisconsin. There Erwin Hiebert was a faculty member in the University of Wisconsin–Madison's department of the history of science and chaired the department from 1960 to 1965. While on academic leave, he was for the academic years 1961–1962 and 1968–1969 a member of the School of Historical Studies of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. He was a visiting professor at the University of Tübingen in 1964–1965 and at Harvard University in 1965. In 1970 his wife Elfrieda Franz Hiebert, an accomplished musician, received a Ph.D. in musicology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Her Ph.D. thesis is entitled The piano trios of Beethoven: an historical and analytical study. In 1970 Erwin Hiebert was appointed to a professorship at Harvard University and the Hiebert family settled in Belmont, Massachusetts. In 1972 he served as the pastor of the Mennonite Congregation of Boston. Erwin Hiebert held a professorship in Harvard's department of the history of science from 1970 to 1989, when he retired as professor emeritus. From 1977 to 1984 he chaired the department. During his professorship at Havard, he was on academic leave in visiting positions in Germany, Jerusalem, Churchill College, Cambridge, and Beijing. For many years during his retirement, he continued to commute almost every day from Belmont to Harvard to work at Widener Library. In retirement, he was a visiting professor in Göttingen for the academic year 1991–1992 and in Berlin for visits in 1998, 2002, and 2007.From 1970 to 1990 Hiebert was a member of the advisory committee of the multi-volume Dictionary of Scientific Biography, published by Charles Scribner's Sons. Hiebert, Robert Sonné Cohen, and Everett Mendelsohn were the general editors of D. Reidel's book series Studies in the History of Science.Hiebert's doctoral students that he supervised or co-supervised include Jed Buchwald, Michael J. Crowe, Lorraine Jenifer Daston, Peter Louis Galison, Diana L. Kormos-Buchwald, Carolyn Merchant, Mary Jo Nye, and Joan L. Richards. In Belmont, Erwin and Elfrieda Hiebert welcomed many of the Harvard students into their home and sometimes entertained their guests with impromptu\nmusical performances. He played the clarinet and she played the piano.He was elected in 1966 a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1975 a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1989 a fellow of the American Physical Society. He was elected in November 1971 a membre correspondant of the Académie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences. In 1992 a festschrift was published in his honor.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe focus of Hiebert's research was the history and philosophy of chemistry and physical sciences in the 2nd half of 19th century and 1st half of the 20th century. During his lifetime he completed three books and his fourth book (which deals with acoustics) was nearly complete at the time of his death. His book 1961 book The Impact of Atomic Energy examined the Manhattan Project, the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and WW II's consequences related to atomic energy from an ethical and religious perspective. He wrote numerous papers on the history of science, the relations between science and religion, and the philosophy of science as viewed by outstanding scientists of the modern era, especially among those scientists from 1850 to 1930 in Germany and Austria. His 1962 book Historical Roots of the Principle of Conservation of Energy is a notable achievement in writing the history of thermodynamics. He wrote papers about the science and philosophy of Max Planck, Ernst Mach, Walther Nernst, Ludwig Boltzmann, Hermann von Helmholtz, and Wilhelm Ostwald. Hiebert \nhad a strong conviction that historians of science should have a good, scientific grounding in the particular science that they study and write about.\n\n\n== Family ==\nErwin Hiebert died in Waltham, Massachusetts in November 2012, shortly after his wife of 69 years died in September 2012. He was survived by their two daughters, Catherine and Margaret, a son Thomas, and seven grandchildren. Catherine Hiebert Beissinger became a professor of Slavic languages and literatures at Princeton University. Thomas Hiebert became a professor of music at California State University, Fresno.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nHiebert, Erwin N.

        "content": "Discretions, also published as Ezra Pound, Father and Teacher: Discretions, is a 1971 memoir of Mary de Rachewiltz, an Italian-American translator and poet. It is about Rachewiltz's childhood with a foster family in the Italian Tyrol and about her father, the American poet Ezra Pound.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nMary de Rachewiltz, a translator and poet, was born as Maria Rudge in 1925 as the daughter of the American poet Ezra Pound and his mistress Olga Rudge, a concert violinist. She grew up at a farm in the Italian Tyrol with a foster family. During her childhood, she met her biological parents during their visits to the farm and her own visits to Venice, where she occasionally observed her father writing poetry. From the age of 13 she lived with Pound and Olga in Venice. As a grown-up, she translated her father's major work The Cantos into Italian.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBrad Darrach of Time called the book a \"discreet but perceptive memoir\" that delivered on the hope that Pound's friends and family would provide their perspectives on the man, whose literary accomplishment and status followed by his choices and Axis sympathies during World War II had puzzled the American establishment. Darrach wrote that the book does not make sense of what was going on inside Pound's head, but through its scenes of family life it \"helps explain his crusty heart\".\nAnatole Broyard of The New York Times wrote that the book's portrayal of life at the farm is more successful than its portrayal of Pound, but that it is fascinating to see Pound described as a father. He wrote that the book contains nothing about Pound's antisemitism, but gives glimpses of his monetary theories, and his idea that understanding \"the nature of money\" is a necessity for writing great poetry. Broyard wrote that Rachewiltz illuminates some obscure parts of The Cantos, which refer to private events, and reveals how Pound increasingly treated The Cantos as a kind of diary.\nIn Modern Age, Henry Regnery called Discretions \"a beautifully written, charming book which tells us much not only about the complex author of Indescretions, but because of her place of observation in the middle of it all, much about our time as well\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNDBooks",

        "content": "Benedykt Ziemilski (October 2, 1892 – 1942) was a Polish physician and researcher. He was the father of Polish sociologist, writer, journalist, and mountaineer Andrzej Ziemilski. He was murdered by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust in 1942 in the Majdanek concentration camp. His Jewish identity, and reason for his murder, were only discovered by his family in recent years.\nIn 2021,  Ziemilski was honored by International March of the Living  for his contributions to medicine during its program “Medicine and Morality: Lessons from the Holocaust”. The 2021 initiative recognized medical professionals who opposed the Nazis, as well as those who worked to combat the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nZiemilski was born as Baruch Zimmels on October 2, 1892, in Ostrava. Until the end of Word War I, his family were citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Bernhard Zimmels, a rabbi in Ostrava, died 10 months after Baruch was born.\nZiemilski (still Baruch at that time) attended medical school at the University of Göttingen around 1912. He served as a military doctor in the Austro-Hungarian army and after, in Piłsudski's Legions, which won Poland's independence. Piłsudski was a notable inspiration to Ziemilski, and he became a member of the Polish Socialist Party PPS.\n\n\n== 1918 to 1935 ==\nIn 1923, Ziemilski married Olga Askenaze, who was born in 1894 and was the daughter of a prominent public figure in the Lviv community. Her father held several important positions, including vice president of Lviv, president of the bar association, and chairman of the Jewish Community for a long time. Ziemilski and Olga had a son named Andrzej. It's has been noted that Ziemilski's brother-in-law was Stefan Askenase, a well-known pianist.\nZimmels graduated from medical school in 1921, and changed his name from Zimmels to Ziemilski, sounding more Polish than German. He also changed his Jewish first name from Baruch to his Christian and Polish name, Benedykt. Many Jews changed their names to avoid identification at that time. He became a prominent doctor in Lviv.\nZiemilski provided healthcare services to prisoners in one of the most significant prisons in Poland, which was situated in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains in a former monastery. He treated an inmate, a thief and informant named Sergiusz Piasecki, who handed him a manuscript for his book. Ziemilski sent the manuscript to publisher and writer Melchior Wańkowicz, ultimately leading to Piasecki's release. Lover of the Great Bear, a novel penned by the author during his time in prison, gained immense popularity in the Second Polish Republic after its publication in 1937. It ranked third among the most well-received novels of the era.\nZiemilski also conducted scientific research to find solutions for hypoglycemia and pulmonary diseases, particularly tuberculosis. His work caught the attention of the German pharmaceutical company Bayer.\nDuring the interwar period in Poland, Dr. Ziemilski had the opportunity to meet with several renowned medical experts, among them Dr. Marek Reichenstein, a pioneering physician and lover of art. Despite the war, Reichenstein's extensive collections endured and are currently exhibited in several museums throughout Lviv. Ziemilski wrote the obituary for Dr. Reichenstein after his passing which was published in Polska Gazeta Lekarska (Nr. 12, 931 issue).\n\n\n== The Holocaust ==\nDuring the beginning of WWII, Ziemilski enlisted to defend Poland from the Germans invading from the west. At the same time, the Soviets were invading from the east and the town of Lviv was under Soviet occupation until 1941. Ziemilski held his practice and his son, Andrzej's school had changed from a Polish to a Ukrainian school.\nBy 1941, Lviv was occupied by the Germans. They had established a ghetto in Lviv and forced the Jews to live there, before deporting them for execution. Ziemilski, being a Jewish doctor was temporarily safe from the Nazi's due to his profession. The Germans required Ziemilski to register his medical profession as required by the German occupation of Lviv. Soon, with the threat of deportation to the camps, he and his family decided to attempt escape to Warsaw. Ziemilski separated from his family to give everyone a better chance of a clean getaway. In a different rail car, he was spotted by passenger, and arrested at Lublin station. He was taken to the death camps at Majdanek. Lublin station was the last time his family had seen him.\n\n\n=== Correspondence From Ziemilski's Apartment ===\nZiemilski's wife and mother had moved near Warsaw using false identities. Sometime after Dr. Ziemilski's death, an individual brought them some mail from their old apartment. The mail from Lwów contained two official letters in German, one of which was from Majdanek notifying the family of Benedykt Ziemilski's death. The other letter was from a German drug company, which announced that Dr. Ziemilski would receive a financial settlement for an important component he had invented.\nEli Rubenstein, author of an article on Dr. Ziemilski and Director of Education for International March of the Living, pointed out the irony of the two letters: \"In effect, one German letter recognizing his brilliance, the other German letter announcing his murder.” The article also mentions that Dr. Ziemilski's descendants thanked the March of the Living for \"bringing to light his story”, after Ziemilski was honored by International March of the Living  for his contributions to medicine in 2021.\n“Hitler not only wanted to destroy the Jewish people but even the memory of the Jewish people and their many important contributions to humanity. Preserving the story of Dr. Ziemilski is one small but important way in which March of the Living even today is able to combat the evil of Nazi Germany's policies,” Rubenstein wrote.\n\n\n== Recognition On The March Of The Living ==\nIn 2021, Ziemilski was honored by International March of the Living  for his contributions to medicine during its program “Medicine and Morality: Lessons from the Holocaust”. The 2021 initiative recognized medical professionals who opposed the Nazis, as well as those who worked to combat the COVID-19 Pandemic. During the program, a candle was lit in honor of Dr. Benedykt Ziemilski by Dr. Allen Nager (Director, Division of Emergency and Transport Medicine and Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC) who also authored a study on the impact of the March of the Living program on adolescents.\n\n\n== Notable family members ==\nFather – Rabbi Bernhard Zimmels (died 1893)\nSon – Andrzej Ziemilski (1923–2003)\nBrother-in-law – Stefan Askenase (1896–1985)\nDaughter-in-law – Małgorzata Dzieduszycka-Ziemilska (born 1949)\nGrandchildren – Wojciech Ziemilski and Paweł Ziemilski\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nEli Rubenstein\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The BIS-Tower, more commonly known as the BIS-high rise, is a 69.5-meter-high administrative tower and headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. Designed by architect Martin Burckhardt and built between 1972 and 1977, the tower is a landmark of the Central Railway Station and the city of Basel. From the year of its construction until 2003, it was the third tallest building in the city. The BIS Tower dominates the Basel skyline with its striking silhouette, and its color scheme and aesthetics set the style for several commercial and administrative buildings in the 1970s.\nBy a special agreement and international conventions, the building has a special legal status (Art. 3 Agreement of February 10, 1987). In addition to its function as administrative headquarters, the building is regularly used by the BIS for international meetings and conferences.\n\n\n== Function and special status ==\nThe BIS Tower is primarily used by BIS as its administration and headquarters. Together with the Botta building on Aeschenplatz, it houses around 600 workplaces. The BIS archive in the basement is listed as a cultural asset of national importance by the Canton of Basel City.\nIn addition, the BIS Tower is a regular venue for bi-monthly meetings of policymakers from the IMF and national central banks. This informal exchange - known as the Basel Process - is designed to foster cooperation among central banks and other bodies and is considered a key pillar of the international financial stability debate. Within this framework, more than 5,000 participants meet annually at events organized by the BIS. These include international committees and standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, known for its Basel III regulations.\nSimilar to the United Nations, the IRCRCM , or the IMF, the BIS has a special status. Employees in the financial sector are granted immunity and may not be searched. The building and all its parts also play a special role. The building and grounds are treated similarly to an embassy and are invulnerable (Swiss usage) or inviolable (German usage). It is part of Swiss territory, but national sovereignty can only be enforced to a limited extent.\nSwiss authorities have access only if the President or CEO of the BIS grants permission and waives the principle of territorial inviolability. This circumstance is often colloquially referred to in the press as extraterritorial status, which is somewhat simplified but not entirely legally correct. This special status is governed by an agreement, which entered into force on January 1, 1987, between the BIS and the Swiss Federal Council. The agreement has its origins in an agreement concluded at the Hague Conference on January 20, 1930. Access by Swiss authorities, including the police, requires the authorization of the President or General Manager of the BIS.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Previous history ===\nWhen the BIS was founded in January 1930, Basel was chosen as its headquarters. For two years, the organization rented the Grand Hôtel et Savoy Hôtel Univers on Basel's Central Railway Station Square for its events and meetings. This temporary location, first rented and then purchased in 1949, remained in use until the 1970s.\nBetween 1954 and 1966, the increasing need for space led the architect Martin Burckhardt to draw up a series of building projects that could be realized on the 3300-square-meter site owned by the bank. It turned out that the project could not meet the requirements on this basis. For this reason, between 1966 and 1972, BIS gradually acquired the 7500-square-meter site near the train station where its current headquarters are located. In 1969, Martin Burckhardt submitted three designs for this new site. Initially, the BIS Board of Directors opted for an 82-meter-high cylindrical tower with 24 floors. Following objections from the Basel Heritage Society that the height of the building would interfere with the historic silhouette of the city, the original design - the so-called vegetative design - was reduced to 69.5 meters and 20 floors. In contrast to the original proposal, the model showed a \"waisted\" cylinder with a capacity for 300 employees.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe design was approved by 69% of the population in a referendum, and construction began in 1972. An excavation up to 15 meters deep was dug for the skyscraper's foundation. The foundation stone was laid on May 14, 1973.\nThe subsoil in the Rhine gravel consisted of gravel-sand material. The excavation pit was closed vertically with underpinning elements and reinforced with alluvial anchors. The water table was 2 to 3 meters below the bottom of the excavation; 4 to 9 meters below was the surface of the Cyrenian marl. The surveying work, divided into four phases, was used to stake out the first-floor level, the building structure, and the work inside the building. The measurements were made with precision theodolites and the forward section method. Up to the fourth floor, high targets were attached to the roof parapets of the surrounding buildings; from the fifth floor onwards, fixed points were set inside the circular building. When the core was completed at a height of 69 meters on the top floor, the control measurement showed a deviation within the tolerance limit of ± 2 millimeters. The topping-out ceremony for the BIS Tower was held on April 25, 1975.\nAfter completion of the interior work, business began on March 21, 1977, and the first meeting of the board of directors was held on April 19. The official inauguration took place on May 9 of that year. At the time of its construction, the BIS Tower was the third-tallest building in the city and the tallest in the downtown area.\n\n\n=== Since construction ===\nIn 1997, in response to the expansion of its activities and the associated increase in staffing requirements, BIS launched an international architectural competition for the redesign of its administration tower. The competition was won by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito and his office, whose design called for two towers. However, the redesign was never realized. Instead, in May 1998, BIS acquired a building designed by Mario Botta on Basel's Aeschenplatz, which was originally occupied by UBS. This modern building, with six floors above ground and six below, and the adjoining neo-baroque villa were extensively renovated by BIS for its use. Since 1999, it has been used as a second building, housing the banking, risk control, and IT departments.\nSince the opening of the BIS Tower, the number of meetings has increased to 300 and the number of participants to 9,000 per year, as needs staff, so that since 2014 the BIS has been evaluating additional expansion options. To this end, the BIS has applied to the canton for a zoning change for the area immediately south of the current tower for further expansion. The plan is to add a multi-story building to the base of the BIS Tower. In 2014, Herzog & de Meuron accompanied the construction plans. However, construction was not to begin until 2020, and the actual design was to be decided by an architectural competition. The current gross floor area of 30,000 square meters was to be increased to 68,000 square meters.\nIn mid-December 2022, it was announced that BIS was planning a new 107-metre-high building next to the BIS Tower to complement the existing BIS Tower for reasons of space. The designs for this high rise were drawn up by the architects Elemental from Santiago de Chile in collaboration with Nissen Wentzlaff from Basel. Their design was the unanimous winner of the architectural competition held in June 2021, in which eleven companies took part.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Location and surrounding area ===\n\nThe BIS Tower is located on the northeastern edge of Central Railway Square, a central transportation hub in Basel; the Basel SBB railway station is on its south side. The building stands on a square plot of land bordered by Heumattenstrasse to the west, Centralbahnstrasse to the south, and Gartenstrasse to the east. The entire site is owned by the BIS. The multi-lane Nauenstrasse to the north is a busy west–east axis within the city. The ramp of the eastern portal to the Nauen tunnel is located at the level of the BIS tower, which allows the central section of Nauenstrasse to run underground. With five trams in Basel, the BIS is also located at a public transportation hub.\nNear the BIS Tower are the Post 2, Hotel Schweizerhof, the administrative building of Basel Insurance, and, opposite the crossroads, the Strassburger Memorial and the Elisabeth Park. In 2020, Baloise Park with the 89-metre-high Baloise Tower was built to the north of the BIS Tower on the site of the Hotel Hilton, which was demolished in 2016.\n\n\n=== Architecture and construction technology ===\n\nThe 69.5-meter-high rotunda-shaped administration and conference building has its main entrance at the corner of Nauenstrasse and Heumattstrasse. The building, with its concave lines, has a ground floor and 19 upper floors, as well as four basement floors, which contain an underground garage for around 300 cars, workshops, archive rooms, rooms for technical equipment, an air-raid shelter, and an infirmary. On the lower floors, the circular floor plan of the building has a diameter of about 30 meters.\nThe circular floors have a cylindrical core as a service shaft, which houses, among other things, the elevator systems. The copper-colored façade consists of a hyperboloid shell of twelve load-bearing steel columns and uniformly inserted glazed metal elements. Each floor consists of 72 facade elements made of polished and anodized aluminum using the Colinal process. Of these, 60 elements are permanently glazed and twelve are designed as solid elements behind which the main load-bearing columns are concealed. The steel parts are hot-dip and spray-painted and the glazing is solar control glass. Two external systems are available for façade maintenance.\n\nThe building has a volume of 174,000 cubic meters, almost half of which is underground. Because the high-rise is founded on Rhine gravel, the foundation slab under the tower is 150 centimeters thick, and another 60 centimeters thick at the edge of the basement. On the lower floors, columns, and walls are used as internal load-bearing elements, arranged radially at 15 and 30 degrees. In addition to the dead load, the reinforced concrete slabs also carry the live load and wind load, transferring these forces to the core. In addition to the elevators, the supply core also houses the exhaust ducts. Half of them run down and half run up to the two control centers. The plumbing and some of the electrical ducts are also located in the core. The external support areas bring air and cooling water to the parapet units. The floors close to the ground also have external staircases, which in turn transfer the stiffening load to the foundations.\nThe large 280-seat auditorium with a granite facade is located near the main entrance. The shed roof slopes toward the tower. This cantilevered building has a flag attachment point on the roof, which is used for flags at official events. On the forecourt in front of the base building, there is a water basin with a small fountain. The edge of the water basin matches the granite used for the base building.\n\n\n=== Landscaping and planting ===\n\nThe BIS Tower is surrounded by this extensive base structure, the roof of which is also partially greened with richly planted terraced gardens and extends up to the seventh floor. This \"flowing\" base of stepped terraces to the southeast and southwest represents a design compromise. The freestanding tower is designed to integrate with its surroundings and, unlike conventional towers, has its front and back. Towards Nauenstrasse, the BIS tower appears representative and creates a counterpoint to the busy street. Towards Heumattstrasse and Gartenstrasse there is a heterogeneous mixture of traditional houses, parking garages, and post offices. The landscaped rear of the building is intended to create a connection to this side of the street. The gardens on the terraces and in the courtyards are landscaped with hardy groundcovers and perennials, including rhododendrons. The planting is intended to provide a necessary contrast to the massive tower architecture, creating a calm, restrained atmosphere.\n\n\n=== Interior design ===\nSince even members of the press are rarely granted access due to strict security regulations, only historical pictures and descriptions of the interior are known. Looking at the circular floor plan of the building, you can see the service shaft in the center, which houses the toilets and elevators. A corridor runs concentrically around this core, leading to the circular office spaces. The geometrically designed rooms are carpeted and the furnishings reflect an exclusive lounge atmosphere from the days when the BIS was based at the Grand Hotel. The arrangement of the lavishly upholstered leather armchairs allows for discretion and tranquility. According to J. M. Andreoli, who was head of the department at the BIS in the late 1970s, the BIS attached particular importance to this design.\nFurthermore, due to the special character of the BIS Tower, no open-plan offices were implemented inside. Most of the workspaces are designed as individual offices. Semi-mobile plasterboard walls also provide good sound insulation.\nThe main entrance and staff restaurant are located on the first floor. The first floor contains a large foyer with the auditorium and four other meeting and conference rooms, as well as simultaneous interpretation facilities for several languages. The 16th floor is dedicated to office space, while the 18th floor has an integrated dining room, which is used for meetings of the board of directors and for receiving central bank governors. The 19th-floor houses part of the building services, including the central air conditioning system and the elevator engine room.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAs a typical 1970s building, the BIS Tower dominates the city skyline. Except for the Messe Tower and the Roche Tower, which will be completed in 2015, Basel has no other high-rise buildings over 100 meters tall, so the striking shape of the BIS Tower stands out from many parts of the city. The local press in Basel gave the tower a consistently positive reception. Even at the time of its construction, the building was described as a new landmark. An article in a special supplement of the Basler Zeitung spoke of an \"undoubtedly impressive new creation\" and a subtle design language thanks to the concave lines. The design also stood up to international comparison. The basic idea of \"vegetative architecture\" has been harmoniously implemented in the choice of materials, their texture, and color. The building creates a calm, reserved atmosphere. In a 2003 retrospective, the magazine Architektur & Technik praised the building's location near the SBB railway station as a well-chosen choice because of the important impulses it provides. Several buildings of urban significance, such as the Peter Merian Haus, have been built around the railway tracks, significantly enhancing the district.\n\nThe BIS Tower had a direct structural impact on the Hilton Hotel across the street, which opened in 1975, closed in 2015, and was demolished in 2016. The hotel's color scheme was adopted in direct consultation with the architectural firm Burckhardt and Partners. Other new buildings in the 1970s, such as the new headquarters of the Swiss Bank Corporation (now the UBS building) on Aeschenplatz, also used the same building materials for the facade design as the BIS.\nIn critical reporting on the global financial world, which is also significantly shaped by the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS tower is often depicted and described as the \"Tower of Basel\" or its construction as the \"Tower of Basel\". This is intended to evoke associations with the Tower of Babel as a symbol of the financial world's hubris and striving for power. However, this symbol is primarily derived from the international financial institution and its role rather than from the building itself.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nbis.org: The BIS's Basel buildings\nTagesWoche: Raumschiff BIZ – so sieht es im Turm von innen aus (Memento from March 5, 2016, in the Internet Archive), article from June 19, 2014\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBank für internationalen Zahlungsausgleich.

        "revision_id": 1218238066,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "NextDNS Inc. is an American cloud-based DNS resolver that offers extensive content filtering and security features, aiming to provide users with control over their internet traffic. Leveraging real-time threat intelligence, NextDNS blocks malware, phishing attempts, and other online dangers, while also enhancing privacy by blocking ads and trackers across websites and apps. Users have the flexibility to customize their filtering rules, enabling them to block specific websites or entire categories of content.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Initial development & launch ===\nNextDNS was founded in May 2019 in Delaware, USA, by French entrepreneurs Olivier Poitrey, who co-founded Dailymotion in 2005, and who currently serves as the Director of Engineering at Netflix, overseeing Open Connect, responsible for 30% of US internet traffic, and Romain Cointepas, who led Dailymotion's mobile and TV department. Together, they established NextDNS.\nPrivacy enhancements arrived shortly after in August 2019, with the implementation of a modified version of EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS). This modification aimed to bolster user privacy by safeguarding the privacy of DNS queries. November 2019 saw a further focus on user protection as NextDNS added the ability to block trackers utilizing the CNAME cloaking technique.\n\n\n=== Mozilla partnership & growth ===\nIn December 2019, NextDNS achieved a notable milestone as Mozilla declared it a Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) within the Firefox browser. This integration came to fruition in February 2020 when NextDNS was officially included as an optional DoH provider in Firefox 73, offering users a choice alongside the default Cloudflare resolver. In April 2020, NextDNS expanded its focus on user control by introducing log storage options across multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, European Union, and Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Business model transition & feature expansion ===\nIn May 2020, NextDNS underwent significant changes, transitioning from a free beta service to a subscription-based model. Specifically, starting May 5, 2020, NextDNS began charging for its services, requiring a subscription to maintain filtering capabilities after reaching 300,000 queries. This shift introduced a pricing structure for continued usage beyond a predetermined threshold of filtered queries. Alongside this change, the service implemented new functionality aimed at optimizing DNS efficiency. Users gained the ability to override the minimum TTL to 5 minutes, reducing the frequency of DNS queries for domains with low TTL values.\n\n\n== Features ==\nNextDNS offers a range of features designed to enhance security, privacy, and control over internet usage. It protects users from malware, phishing, and other online threats by blocking malicious domains. NextDNS enhances privacy by blocking ads, trackers, and third-party cookies. It also includes parental controls for content filtering, creating safer online spaces for children. Detailed analytics and logs provide insights into internet usage and blocked threats. Finally, customizable configurations allow users to tailor their protection across different devices and networks.\n\n\n=== Security features ===\nThreat Intelligence Feeds: Blocks domains associated with malware, phishing, and command-and-control servers by using curated threat intelligence feeds, in real time.\nCOVID-19 Phishing Protection: Provides specific protection against phishing scams themed around COVID-19.\nAI-Driven Threat Detection (Beta): Leverages a proprietary AI engine to block additional threats based on behavioral analysis and extensive training data, in real time.\nGoogle Safe Browsing: Employs Google's Safe Browsing technology for malware and phishing protection.\nCryptojacking Protection: Prevents unauthorized cryptocurrency mining using devices on your network.\nDNS Rebinding Protection: Blocks attacks that attempt to take control of local devices through malicious DNS responses.\nIDN Homograph Attacks Protection: Protects against domains using characters from other alphabets to mimic legitimate sites.\nTyposquatting Protection: Blocks domains designed to exploit common typos when entering web addresses.\nDomain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) Protection: Blocks domains associated with malware command and control servers often generated through DGAs.\nBlock Newly Registered Domains (NRDs): Optionally blocks recently registered domains, which can be favored by malicious actors.\nBlock Dynamic DNS Hostnames (Beta): Blocks hostnames associated with Dynamic DNS services that may be used for malicious purposes.\nBlock Parked Domains: Blocks domains that primarily display advertisements and lack meaningful content.\nBlock Top-Level Domains (TLDs): Provides granular control by allowing the blocking of entire top-level domains.\nBlock Child Sexual Abuse Material: Works with Project Arachnid (operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection) to block domains known to host CSAM.\n\n\n=== Privacy features ===\nAd & Tracker Blocking: Blocks ads and trackers across websites and apps.\nBypass Anti-Adblockers: Helps access content on sites that attempt to detect and block ad-blockers.\nNative Tracking Protection (Beta): Blocks a range of trackers that often work at the operating system level.\nBlock Disguised Third-Party Trackers: Identifies and blocks trackers that try to bypass browser privacy protections by pretending to be first-party trackers.\n\n\n=== Parental Controls ===\nContent Filtering: Flexible filtering options to block categories of websites (adult content, gambling, etc.)\nCustomizable Deny/Allow Lists: Manually block or allow specific websites.\nSafe Search Enforcement: Ensures safe search results on major search engines.\nTime Restrictions: Schedule internet access limits for specific devices.\n\n\n=== Performance features ===\nSpeed Enhancements: Potential browsing speed improvements through content delivery optimization and minimized DNS queries.\nAnonymized EDNS Client Subnet: May speed up content delivery without compromising user privacy.\nCache Boost: Minimizes DNS queries with enforced TTL (Time to Live).\nCNAME Flattening: Reduces unnecessary network traffic in specific configurations.\n\n\n=== Web3 (Beta) integration ===\nWeb3 Support: Provides access to the decentralized web, including blockchain-based domain registries and distributed content storage networks.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAnalytics: Detailed logs and statistics on internet usage patterns.\nCustomization: Multiple configuration profiles, custom block pages, DNS rewrites, and log retention control.\nCompatibility: Supports a wide range of operating systems and devices and can be installed on routers.\nRewrites: Ability to set or override DNS responses for advanced configuration.\n\n\n== Network infrastructure ==\nNextDNS operates a globally distributed DNS network designed to provide fast query responses and high reliability. This infrastructure uses the following principles: anycast networking in many locations, meaning a single IP address is distributed across multiple servers in different geographic regions, enabling users to connect to the closest available server for reduced latency. In each location, NextDNS utilizes two distinct network providers with separate network paths and data centers. This approach aims to increase resilience, so if one provider's service becomes unavailable, traffic can be rerouted automatically. As a supplementary system, NextDNS offers ultralow latency DNS resolution. This functions similarly to anycast, but with NextDNS's own DNS steering system for routing and rerouting traffic. Ultralow may provide even lower latency than anycast in specific scenarios but requires the use of encrypted protocols like DNS over HTTPS (DoH), DNS over TLS (DoT), or DNS over QUIC (DoQ).\nSimilar to NextDNS, major public DNS providers like Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and Google Public DNS also leverage anycast networks to optimize DNS query response times for users around the world.\n\n\n== References ==",

In June 1995 excavations were conducted on the site and the remains of a church, a road station, a mosaic floor, and an oil press were found there dating back to the beginning of the 5th century CE. \n\n\n== Site identification ==\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, the site of Kh. El Latatin has been identified with the road station mentioned on the Madaba map as TO ENNATON (literally: \"the ninth\"). This is due to a certain preservation of the in the name of the ruins, due to the findings of the road station at the site, and due to the location of the site around the ninth milestone on the Roman road between Jerusalem and Lod, via Bethoron.\nAccording to a minority opinion, the site of the ninth mile mentioned in the Madaba map refers to the second Roman road that connected Jerusalem to Lod, which passed through Motza (Roman Colonia Amosa), through today's Abu Ghosh and Emmaus.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On 10 April 2024, Ma Ying-jeou, the former President of the Republic of China (Taiwan; ROC), and Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and President of the People's Republic of China (Mainland China; PRC), met in Beijing. The meeting was the second meeting between Xi and Ma; the pair previously met in Singapore in 2015, when Ma was still the incumbent president. The meeting was part of Ma's 2024 visit to mainland China, his second visit during his post-presidency.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring his presidency from 2008 to 2016, Ma pushed for closer Cross-Strait relations. Xi and Ma previously met in 2015 in Singapore, in their capacities as the leaders of mainland China and Taiwan, respectively. Ma left office in 2016, and was succeeded by Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors a more Taiwanese nationalist identity in contrast with Ma's Kuomintang.\n\n\n== Meeting ==\nAt 4:00 p.m Beijing Time., Xi and Ma met at the East Hall of the Great Hall of the People, shaking hands for nearly 20 seconds.As the PRC does not recognize the ROC, Xi referred to Ma as \"Mr. Ma Ying-jeou\" rather than the former president. Similarly, Ma referred to Xi by his title of Party General Secretary. Ma said \"If war breaks out between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it’ll be unbearable for the Chinese nation\", continuing by saying \"Chinese people on both sides of the strait are definitely wise enough to handle various disputes peacefully and avoid conflicts\".Xi said \"Compatriots on both sides of the Straits are all Chinese, there is no irritation that cannot be resolved, there is no problem that cannot be discussed, there is no force that can divide us\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jewish populations have existing in most of the history of settled Tasmania, Australia. The current total population of Jews in Tasmania is 376. Most live in the capital city of Hobart.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Jews in Tasmania, were convicts, mostly from East London.Two Jews named Judah and Joseph Solomon, were two brothers sentenced for death, because they promoted crime in England in 1819. Eventually, their sentences got commuted, and were deported to Tasmania on March 1, 1820. They eventually opened a general store which would sell imported goods.\n\nAfter the brothers were given freedom from their servitude, they moved North to Launceston, and built a house on Argyle and Liverpool streets and used it as a synagouge before the construction of the Hobart Synagogue. One Jew named Emanuel Levy was granted land in 1820, and soon Jewish settlement in Tasmania increased heavily. By 1854, the population of Jews in Tasmania reached 435 people, of which 259 were free (not in prison). This is important because Australia was founded as a penal colony. Soon the population began to decline, due to emigration to England and New Zealand, and by 1891, the population had fallen to 81.\n\n[\nDespite the number increasing to 154 in 1945, the number fell again to 98 in 1971. However, by the early 2000s the number had risen to 180. Increasingly, Tasmania has been the choice for many Australians when choosing a place in Australia to live. The same is said about Australia's Jewish population. Due to low prices in Tasmania, as compared to larger Australian cities like Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, and Canberra, many Jews have decided to settle in Tasmania. Other reasons include the beautiful nature in Tasmania.\n\n\n== Problems ==\nDespite the increasing Jewish population inside Tasmania, there are not many Jewish services available to the local residents. There are no local stores selling kosher food. Due to local fishery laws, the local Jews could not legally import canned Schmaltz Herrings until recently. There is only two synagogues in Tasmania, The Jewish Community Center of Tasmania, and the Hobart Synagogue. This causes numerous members of the community to have to walk long distances to be able to pray, and perform other Jewish services. However, the Chabad Synagogue in Launceston has a rabbi, Yochanan, who lives there with his wife Rachel and son.\n\n\n== Proposals for a Jewish State ==\nPart of Southern Tasmania, was considered as a proposal for a Jewish State. Critchley Parker, a young journalist visited the Tasmanian nature and officially proposed it to be a home for the Jewish State. He met up with Dr. Isaac Steinburg who stated he could fit 50,000 Jewish refugees, in a part of Tasmania, known as Kimberly. After hiking the land for a long while, Parker and his associates began to believe that Kimberly could be an adequate place to house at least some of Europe's Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. Eventually, Parker began to show signs of fatigue from exploring and eventually died in 1944\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mandatory war (Hebrew: מלחמת חובה‎; milḥemet ḥovah), is a technical term found in Hebrew classical literature and denoting a war that requires the entire nation of the Jewish people to rise-up and to become actively engaged-in because of an existential threat to the Jewish nation. The aim is to thwart the enemy advances against the nation of Israel, without the necessity of enslaving and exterminating the enemy, or of annexing the enemy's territory. It is to be distinguished from a \"voluntary war\" (מלחמת רשות‎; milḥemet reshūt), that is to say, a battle waged of free choice, which requires the approbation of the Sanhedrin. It is also to be distinguished from a \"religious war\" (מלחמת מצוה‎; milḥemet mitzvah), which is restricted to those nations mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, such as Amalek and the nations of Canaan. The biblical command, in the case of the Canaanite inhabitants, was to exterminate them and to annex their territory, whereas others who made peace with Israel could be enslaved and forced to pay tribute.\n\n\n== General overview ==\nSpecifically relating to the halachic laws governing the Jewish nation, Spanish Jewish rabbi and scholar, Menahem Meiri, has described the conditions needed for there to be a \"mandatory war\", saying that all wars, excepting those made for the conquest of the Land of Israel (such as at the time of Joshua), are to be deemed as \"voluntary wars\". A ruler cannot compel the Jewish people to fight in such \"voluntary wars\" (so-named because the ruler of that nation is either angry at his enemy, or simply wishes to show his prowess, or to extend his territorial domain), unless it be by the authorization of the greater Sanhedrin, composed of seventy-one judges. However, if there were a case whereby the nation of Israel had been attacked by an enemy for any reason, that would be tantamount to a battle waged in a religious cause (\"religious war\"), in which case it is the bounden duty of all in Israel to fight and resist the enemy, hence: a mandatory war (or battle waged in duty bound).Maimonides further explains that whenever Israel finds itself fighting a battle in a religious cause, such as when an oppressor has come upon them in war to destroy them, the people of Israel need not obtain prior permission from the Rabbinic court to fight, but may go forth to the battle, and compel others to do the same.The Hebrew expressions, Milḥemet mitzvah (religious war) and Milḥemet ḥovah (mandatory war), are sometimes used interchangeably, since they include the reactive defensive wars when Jewish habitations were attacked. Rabbi Yehuda, however, distinguishes between these two expressions.\n\n\n== Rabbinic discussions ==\n[When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them, for the Lord your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, etc. (Deut. 20:1–ff.)] What is being spoken about here? Said Rabbi Yehuda: 'The matter concerns a religious war (milḥemet mitzvah). However, in a mandatory war (milḥemet ḥovah), all go forth [into battle], even a bridegroom from his room and a bride from her bridal-chamber.' Our Mishnah [in Soṭah speaks of] when you go out to war against your enemies. The writing [in Mishnah Soṭah] speaks about the voluntary war (milḥemet ha-reshūt) [fought at Israel's own discretion].\nOne of the fine points arising from the rabbinic discussions on the subject is that, whenever Israel voluntarily wages a battle of free choice against another nation, unto Israel would apply all the conditions mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Deuteronomy 20:1–ff.) and in Mishnah Soṭah (chapter 8). Although certain persons were permitted by Deuteronomy, chapter 20, to leave the field before a battle began, this was allowed, according to rabbinical opinion, only in case of a voluntary war. Wherefore, a man who is newly married, or who has planted a vineyard and has yet to partake of its fruit, or who has built a new house and who has not yet lived in that house for a year's time, etc. is exempt from participating in that war. However, if Israel were faced with an existential threat, the conditions of Deuteronomy (chapter 20) and of Mishnah Soṭah (chapter 8) would not apply, as not even a bridegroom is exempt from that war, but must rally behind Israel, and go forth to fight in Israel's defense.  A mandatory war is, therefore, tantamount to a \"religious war\" and, as such, the general principle applies to everyone: \"He that is currently engaged in performing one biblical commandment (i.e. defending Israel), he is exempt from doing another biblical commandment (i.e. cohabiting with his bride, etc.)\" (העוסק במצוה פטור מן המצוה‎).\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmed conflict\nDeclaration of war\nInternational humanitarian law\nJus ad bellum\nJust war theory\nLaw of war\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGrunblatt, Joseph (1968). \"Violence and Some Aspects of the Judaic Tradition\".

        "content": "Food journalism is a field of journalism that focuses on news and current events related to food, its production and culture of producing and consuming that food. Typically food journalism includes a scope broader than the work of food critics who analyze restaurants and food products, and is similar to, and sometimes treated as a sub-genre of food writing, which documents the experience and history of food.Food journalism often explores the impact of current events on food, such as how the Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food industry, or larger issues, such as impacts of climate change on food production. Increasingly these themes overlap with public health journalism, political journalism and economic journalism. This expands on themes traditional to food criticism which has tended to focus on fine dining, and other kinds of food writing such as cookbook writing. These themes are similar to the themes covered in agricultural journalism, which focuses on the agriculture industry for agricultural audiences.\nThe contemporary field of food journalism grew in the mid-20th century, especially as issues like food rationing during and after World War II. In the United States, the Association of Food Journalists provides professional standards and a code of ethics.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mohamed Bachir El Ibrahimi (Arabic: محمد البشير الإبراهيمي), also known as Sheikh Bachir El Ibrahimi (June 13, 1889 – May 20, 1965) was an Algerian Islamic scholar known for his important role in Algerian Islamic Reformism especially as one of the seniors of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema · .\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMohamed Bachir El Ibrahimi was born on June 13, 1889 (14 Shawwal 1306 AH) in Ouled Brahem within the Arab tribe of Awlād Ibrāhīm, in a family descended from Muhammad, where he began his religious education by memorizing the Quran and studying some texts (moutoun) of Maliki jurisprudence (fiqh) with his father and uncle.\n\n\n=== Education in Cairo and Medina (1911-1916) ===\nIn 1911 (1330 AH), he joined his family in Medina via Cairo (where he stayed for 3 months during which he met the Egyptian poets Ahmed Shawqi and Hafez Ibrahim). In the second holiest city in Islam, he studied Imam Malik's Muwatta and Maliki jurisprudence under the patronage of Sheikh Abdelaziz al-Tounissi, and Sahih Muslim under Hussain Ahmed Madani, a prominent figure in Deobandism and Indian nationalist activism. He was also influenced by students of religious science (toulab al-ilm) from Chinguetti. Additionally, he undertook memorization of several collections of poems, thus gaining eloquence beneficial for his career.\n\n\n=== Damascus (1916-1920) ===\nIn 1916, due to political unrest in the Hejaz (Arab revolt, siege of Medina), he moved to Damascus, where he continued his religious education at the Umayyad Mosque alongside scholars (ulema) Mohammed Al-Khidr Hussein, Djamal ad-Dine al-Qassimi, and Badreddine al-Hassani.\nIn 1919, he participated in the founding of the Arab Academy of Damascus with Muhammad Kurd Ali.\n\n\n=== Return to Algeria (1920-1924) ===\nUpon his return to Algeria in 1920 (1338 AH), he worked on spreading reform (al-islah) and religious education in the city of Sétif, where he ran a mosque not affiliated with the French colonial authorities.\n\n\n=== Reform Movement and the Association of Algerian Muslim Scholars ===\nIn 1924, his friend Abdelhamid Ben Badis, whom he met in Medina, proposed the idea of creating the Algerian reform movement (al-harakat al-islah al-djaza'iriyyah), which he enthusiastically accepted. His first mission for the movement was to preach in western Algeria, which he accomplished successfully by establishing several free Quranic schools (madaris) and delivering captivating sermons (khoutab).\nHis activities within the reform movement and later, starting from 1931, within the Association of Muslim Scholars, drew hostility from some notables and Sufis who demanded that the colonial authorities take action against him. This happened in 1939 when they decided to exile him to Aflou after he authored an anti-colonialist article in the El-Islah newspaper. After Ben Badis' death in 1940, he was elected as the head of the Association of Muslim Scholars while still under house arrest. This ended on December 28, 1942, following the Allied landing in North Africa, but El Ibrahimi was arrested again after the events of May 1945. Released a year later, he resumed his public activities and wrote scathing articles against French colonialism and its \"agents\" in the columns of the El-Bassir newspaper, which reopened in 1947.\n\n\n=== Post-Independence (1962) ===\nAfter Algeria gained independence in 1962, he held the positions of imam and khatib in the Ketchaoua Mosque. However, opposed to Ben Bella's socialist self-management regime, he once again faced house arrest and died in this situation on May 20, 1965, less than a month before the coup d'état that ousted Ben Bella.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 5996 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Serpens. The galaxy lies about 125 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 5996 is approximately 65,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 21, 1784.\nNGC 5996 forms a pair with a smaller companion galaxy, NGC 5994, which lies at a distance of about 40,000 light years. The galaxy pair is known as Arp 72. The interaction of the two galaxies has created a long and faint tidal tail about 3.8 arcminutes long curving away from the northern edge of the disk of NGC 5996 towards the east and south. A hydrogen bridge has been observed between the two galaxies and hydrogen emission is also observed west of NGC 5994. The interaction has possibly induced star formation activity in NGC 5996 both in the nucleus and the disk, with a star formation rate of 1.43 M☉ per year. The brightest star cluster in the galaxy is estimated to be 5 million years old.\nThe galaxy pair is part of the NGC 5996 Group, which also includes UGC 10044 and IC 1135.\nOne supernova has been observed in NGC 5996, ASASSN-15db, which was discovered when it had an apparent magnitude of 16.7 and it was categorised as a type Ia supernova five days before maximum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 5996 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "David Emery Misch (born February 19, 1961) is an American murderer and suspected serial killer who was convicted of the 1989 murder of a woman in California, and later linked via DNA to three additional murders dating back to 1986. One of his accused victims is Michaela Garecht, a 9-year-old girl whose 1988 disappearance achieved notoriety in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nMisch is currently facing murder charges in relation to the three murders, and is awaiting trial.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDavid Emery Misch was born on February 19, 1961, in Chicago, Illinois, but in the mid-1960s, his family moved to Hayward, California, where he spent his youth and teenage years. Misch's father Robert was an alcoholic who was aggressive towards his wife and son, and a result of the constant physical assaults, David lost all interest in the educational process in the mid-1970s. In later interviews, he said that he blamed his mother for not stopping the abuse.As he often clashed with his parents, Misch spent most of his time on the streets and began engaging in criminal activities from the age of 16.\n\n\n== Criminal history ==\n\n\n=== Violent crimes ===\nIn 1977, the 16-year-old Misch entered a neighbor's house and raped a housecleaner at knifepoint. After the sexual assault, he attempted to strangle her, but she kicked him in the stomach and somehow managed to convince him to spare her. Misch was arrested shortly afterwards, but as he was a juvenile, he was given a minor prison sentence and released on parole in 1979.\nA few days after his release, Misch, clad only in a jacket, broke into another neighbor's house and threatened to kill a woman and her two children with a knife, but did not harm either of them and left the house. Nevertheless, he was arrested and ordered to undergo a forensic psychiatric examination, which concluded that he was insane, after which he was transferred to the Atascadero State Hospital for treatment, where he was treated for the next several months. In September 1981, Misch's mental condition improved and he was deemed to not be a danger to society, whereupon he was released and returned to live in his parents' house in Hayward. There, he found work as a sign painter for a local construction company.In June 1982, Misch was putting up real estate signs on utility poles on Broadway Terrace in Oakland Hills when he noticed 18-year-old Swiss student Betina Benthaus, who had come to the United States on a student exchange program. He grabbed her from behind and threatened to kill her, cutting her lip during a scuffle and then punching her into unconsciousness. Misch attempted to drag her to a nearby driveway, but spotted by rattled residents who confronted him. In an attempt to escape, he lied that she had simply fallen, and while the others were not looking, he got into his pickup truck and fled. However, the residents memorized the name of the car dealership engraved on the truck and immediately notified police, who quickly traced it back to Misch, who was soon arrested and charged with assault and attempted rape. For this crime, he would later convicted and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment.\nAfter serving out his sentence in full, Misch was released and returned to Hayward, where he moved in with a girlfriend and earned money from manual labor and occasional thefts. In November 1987, his girlfriend gave birth to a son named David Michael Misch, who died at the age of 3 months in February 1988. Shortly after his son's death, Misch was arrested on a theft charge and imprisoned for several months in the Alameda County Jail.\nHe was paroled yet again on November 14, 1988, and immediately returned to Hayward. Just eight days later, he was apprehended by police officers after a routine check of his vehicle led to the discovery of wire cutters, an axe, a large penknife and a flashlight. He was eventually charged with theft and convicted once again in April 1989, for which he had to serve 17 months at the San Quentin State Prison.\n\n\n=== Murder of Margaret Ball ===\nAfter serving seven months in prison, Misch was granted parole and released on November 17, 1989. On December 8, he was arrested for the murder of 36-year-old Margaret Narcisa Ball, who was found beaten and stabbed to death in her home on Lowell Avenue, Oakland the day prior. Her body was found in the living room by the 11-year-old daughter of her boyfriend Michael Zaboy, bearing stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. A search of the apartment also revealed some food stamps and pocket change had been stolen, which amounted to $85 in total.The investigators immediately focused their efforts on locating Ball's car - a 1981 silver-colored Mazda - which they eventually found near the Farm House Motel on MacArthur Boulevard, driven by none other than David Misch. Shortly after detaining him, officers learned from Zaboy and Ball's family members that Misch - whom they knew simply as \"Dave\" - was an acquaintance who had repeatedly sexually harassed and threatened her with physical violence. While Misch himself denied responsibility, his father would later testify that on the day of the murder, David came home and confessed to killing Ball in a methamphetamine-induced robbery. He would eventually confess, but claimed that they were engaged in consensual sex when Ball suddenly told him that she did not want to continue - upon hearing so, Misch said that he slapped her, prompting the woman to pull a knife on him.Misch would eventually be convicted of this murder in 1990, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. In subsequent years, Misch was moved around various penitentiaries in the California penal system, and had three of his parole applications denied.\n\n\n== Link to previous crimes ==\n\n\n=== Michelle Xavier and Jennifer Duey ===\nIn 2003, a blood sample was taken from Misch for DNA testing, which revealed that his genotypic profile matched that of a man whose epithelial particles were found under the fingernails of 20-year-old friend Jennifer Duey. Duey, along with her 18-year-old friend Michelle Xavier, had recently graduated from the Notre Dame High School in San Jose and planned to attend a friend's birthday party in Fremont. The pair were last seen alive at a 7-Eleven on February 1, 1986, and on the following day, a passing motorcyclist found their bodies off Mill Creek Road. Duey had been stabbed several times and Xavier had been shot, with the killer later having stolen Xavier's 1984 Pontiac Sunbird convertible, which was found abandoned in the parking lot of a shopping center located about three miles away from where the girls' bodies were found.Soon after this, Misch was interviewed in prison, but claimed that he had nothing to do with the murders. Instead, he claimed that on the day of the murders, he was filling his car at a gas station when he apparently saw one of the two girls being dragged away by two men, whereupon he supposedly came to their aid and fought with the kidnappers, who managed to escape. Misch claimed that the skin particles found under the fingernails were because one of the girls likely scratched him in the fight, and that he was a \"protector of all the girls\" and prostitutes who worked in the area. Despite proclaiming to be a Good Samaritan, Misch also admitted to liking \"big knives\" and that he had attacked Benthaus because she was \"walking with an arrogant attitude\".Shortly after the end of the interview, detectives realized that their recorded that turned off halfway through, and attempted to schedule another meeting with Misch weeks later, however, he completely recanted his story and refused to admit to anything, leading to him not being charged in this case for more than 14 years. On September 8, 2017, Misch was interviewed yet again, and on September 21, he attempted to hang himself in his jail cell, leaving behind a suicide note addressed to his brother, in which he claimed that he wanted to protect him and their mom from further questioning and embarrassment. However, he survived the suicide attempt, and in the following year he was charged with the double murder and ordered to be transferred to the Alameda County Jail from the Folsom State Prison.\n\n\n=== Michaela Garecht ===\n\nIn late December 2020, Misch was charged with the kidnapping and murder of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht, who was abducted on November 19, 1988, from the Rainbow Market in Hayward. Her best friend, who was with her at the time, testified that the two girls had just come out of the store when they noticed that Garecht's scooter was missing. They proceeded to search for it, and eventually found it in the far corner of the store's parking lot - Garecht then attempted to retrieve it, but was then abducted by a white male with long hair in his early 30s who drove up to her in a gold or brown Oldsmobile with no hubcaps, and pulled her inside.Her abduction caused a public outcry, and was repeatedly investigated over the following decades. Several people were considered suspects at different times - among them child killer Curtis Dean Anderson and serial killer duo Loren Herzog and Wesley Shermantine, collectively known as the Speed Freak Killers. According to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, on the day of Garecht's abduction, Misch was at the nearby Chapel of the Chimes Cemetery visiting the gravestone of his young son, on what would have been his first birthday. The cemetery was located across the street from the market, giving him ample opportunity to abduct the girl.The main evidence against Misch was a partial palm print and thumbprint on Garecht's scooter, which, according to investigators, they were able to obtain thanks to the advancements of technology. On the other hand, Misch's lawyers said that they would insist on their client's innocence at trial, arguing that since Garecht's body has never been found, a murder cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. And as for the murders of Xavier and Duey, they have argued that it only proves that there was contact between their client and the victims, but that it does not necessarily prove that he had killed them - in addition, they have argued that there's a strong possibility that there was another person involved. This suspect - a former police officer who worked in Fremont, Union City, Seaside and Modesto - had a brother who was dating Duey at the time, and was reportedly so suspicious that even the judge presiding at Misch's preliminary trial said that he believed this man is involved somehow.\n\n\n== 2024 trial ==\nMisch's trial for the murders of Xavier and Duey began on March 4, 2024. The Alameda County Prosecutor's Office insisted on consolidating the two murder cases into one trial because all three murder charges against the defendant were similar in motive and execution, but Misch's lawyers objected, arguing that it was mostly circumstantial evidence or speculation. Misch has since pleaded not guilty and waived his right to a speedy trial, with his next scheduled court date set for May 19, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "United in Hate: The Left's Romance with Tyranny and Terror is a 2009 book by Jamie Glazov. In the book, Glazov analyses segments of the political left's sympathies for Islamic terrorists.\n\n\n== Content ==\nAmong those Glazov accuses of having found common ground with Islamic terrorists are Jimmy Carter, Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Ramsey Clark, Lynne Stewart, and Stanley Cohen, while noting that Norman Mailer called the 9/11 hijackers \"brilliant\", and Ted Turner calling them \"brave\". According to Glazov, \"The Left's hatred of America is not the cause, it's a symptom. Hard-core leftists hate simply for the sake of hate. The outspoken leaders of the hard Left, Glazov documents, are not happy, contented people. They are as alienated from what they would scornfully call a 'bourgeois' lifestyle as any suicide bomber.\" He also notes that they \"fall in love with mass-murdering reprobates who propose utopia of any kind - though utopia is the cover motive, not the real attraction.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJonathan Schanzer wrote in Middle East Quarterly that Glazov \"exposes the hypocrisy of leftists and liberals who claim to champion the principles of freedom, democracy, liberalism, and feminism yet support both communist and Islamist dictatorships, which implement none of these principles.\"\nIn The Jerusalem Post, David Forsmark wrote that it is \"a revolutionary book, in the best sense of the word. It gives a coherent explanation for a much-remarked-about phenomenon that most commentators have merely used to score irony points.\"\nBruce S. Thornton said in City Journal that the book \"is a valuable aid for those wishing to understand one of the strangest spectacles in history: a large number of a society’s most privileged people, who enjoy unprecedented freedom, education, material well-being, and leisure, relentlessly attacking the institutions and ideals that make such benefits possible—and extolling enemies who seek to destroy all of these goods.\"\nNick Dyrenfurth noted in the Australian Journal of Jewish Studies that \"on the face of it, a scholarly study of the relationship between the far left and political Islam is a worthwhile, if not urgent endeavour.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlazov talk on C-SPAN about the book",

        "content": "The Club Renato Cesarini is an Argentine association football club and sports school based in the city of Rosario, Argentina. It was formally founded on 15 January 1975.\nAt a historical level, it is a club that has stood out for the quality of players that emerged from the quarry, among them, Javier Mascherano, Martín Demichelis, Augusto Solari, among others.\nThe team played in the Argentine Primera División, previously known as the National Championship, on several occasions. He has also played other official tournaments such as the Torneo Argentino A and Torneo Argentino B. At the regional level he has played in tournaments organized by the Asociación Rosarina de Fútbol, such as the Campeonato de Fútbol de Rosario, where he became champion on several occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Club Renato Cesarini is a sports institution founded on 15 January 1975, by Jorge Solari, Eduardo Solari and the brothers Daniel and Ermindo Onega. It was founded in honor of the former soccer player Renato Cesarini, an Italian nationalized Argentine who stood out in the Club Atlético River Plate and in Europe in the Italian club,Juventus, in both clubs he won titles. He was also technical director on both clubs.\nIt has a sports complex where there are 50 soccer fields.\n\n\n=== First championship and arrival to the AFA ===\nStarting in 1967, the clubs from the interior of the country began to participate in a new competition of the Argentine Football Association, exclusive for the champion clubs of the regional leagues of the country: the Regional Tournament, which had the objective of classifying the best to the National Championship, a new First Division competition, parallel to the regular competition. However, because the best teams in the Rosario and Santa Fe leagues were already affiliated, the province was excluded from the competition until 1971.\nThe club would quickly gain access to the tournament. Despite being a newly founded club, it managed to win the Rosarino Championship in 1978, breaking a 10-year streak of championships won only by Newell's Old Boys and Rosario Central.\nOn 18 February 1979, the club made its debut in the Torneo Regional, beating Gimnasia y Esgrima 3 to 1 and then winning as a visitor and due to the ordering of the teams, they qualifying directly to the Third Phase, where it would end up falling in both games against Chaco For Ever, being left out of the final.\n\n\n== Trajectory ==\n\n\n=== Large tournaments participated ===\nPrimera Division de Argentina\nTorneo Argentino A\nTorneo Argentino B\nCampeonato de Fútbol de Rosario\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n=== Regional tournaments ===\nTorneo Hermenegildo Ivancich (1): 1998\nTorneo Gobernador Luciano Molinas  (3): 1978, 1995 and 2004\n\n\n=== National tournaments ===\nTorneo Regional (2): 1982 and 1983\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nWithin the scope of the Asociación Rosarina de Fútbol, Renato Cesarini does not have a clear classic rival. However, the appearance in recent years of an entity with similar characteristics, called the Asociación Atlética Jorge Griffa (named in honor of another great trainer of football players from Rosario, in a similar way to Cesarini), generates an interesting duel between two clubs with characteristics of sports training schools, in the Rosario area.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFootball in Argentina\nRosario\n\n\n== References ==",

The son of Pierre Paganel, a member of the French Convention, Camille Paganel began his career as a lawyer in 1816.

        "content": "Lake Suviana (Italian: Lago di Suviana) is an artificial lake located in metropolitan city of Bologna, Italy in the Bolognese Apennines, formed following the construction of a 91.5 m (300 ft) high dam, begun in 1928 and completed in 1932.\nThe lake, surrounded by a pine forest, forms together with the nearby Lake Brasimone with grassy banks the Suviana and Brasimone lakes regional park that is a protected area since 1995. The lake is used for  production of hydroelectric energy but also for bathing activities, water sports and carp fishing. In the lake are specimens of carp weighing 20 kg (44 lbs). The lake is equipped with various refreshment points and bathing facilities which make it a holiday destination during the summer season.\nThe basin is mainly fed by the eastern Limentra stream (or lower Limentra) and is located entirely in the metropolitan city of Bologna. The two banks border the municipality of Camugnano, to the east, and the municipality of Castel di Casio to the west. The villages of Suviana, Baigno, Badi, Bargi and Stagno overlook the lake. It is the largest lake in the province and one of the largest in the Emilia-Romagna region.\nThe Suviana dam was built by the State Railways with the aim of powering a hydroelectric power station with the waters of the lake, which still exists downstream of the dam, so that it could supply energy to the new Bologna-Florence railway line, known as the Direttissima. This power plant, which has a gross efficient power of 26,760 kW, exploits the waters of the Suviana basin and those of the Pavana basin, to which the lake is connected via a submerged railway tunnel.\nEnel built in 1975 the Bargi hydroelectric power station upstream, which is also powered by the waters of the nearby and overlying Brasimone basin, which is connected to Lake Suviana by a pipeline that exploits the difference in height between the two reservoirs, approximately 384 m (1,260 ft). This connection, however, is not functional for production, but for \"peak-shaving\", that is, it is used in production during the hours of maximum demand, while in the hours of minimum load the turbines of the Bargi power plant, being reversible, pump the water back to the Brasimone basin, reconstituting the reserve. The original purpose was to shift the electrical load from day to night and from working days to holidays, to avoid switching off the thermoelectric units of the national grid.\n\n\n== Explosion ==\nOn 9 April 2024, an explosion at the Bargi hydroelectric power station owned by Enel Green Power in the village of Bargi, upstream of Lake Suviana left at least seven workers dead, five others critically injured along with four missing.\n\n\n== References ==",

The station is part of Red RUBI.\n\n\n== History ==\nTVU is the second-oldest television channel in La Paz, after Televisión Boliviana, which until 1980 was the only television station in the city.\nBetween 1976 and 1980, Bolivia was setting up a network of university television stations. While these stations were funded by the government, they had independent management. In this context, in 1979, the Higher University of San Andrés founded its television station under the auspices of the National Council for Higher Education, with experimental broadcasts in closed circuit. By means of Supreme Decree nº 16800, the station's first terrestrial broadcast was held on December 24, 1980, when the station formally launched, on VHF channel 5 (currently occupied by Bolivisión), with a 1Kw transmitter and a daily schedule running from 5:30pm to 10pm. It is unknown when did the station move to the current frequency (channel 13). By the early 2010s, the channel was added to COTEL TV and Multivisión's cable offers.\nIn January 2016, TVU started broadcasting from its new headquarters.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Michael Alberti (13 November 1682 – 17 May 1757) was a German pietist physician and theologian. Alberti became an ardent follower of Stahl's school of medical theory which considered the soul as having control on the body. Therapies involved dealing with the internal senses and feelings. Along with his students he produced nearly 300 dissertations.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nAlberti was born in Nuremberg where his father Paul Martin was clergyman. A brother Paul Martin (d. 1729) served as Archdeacon of Hersbruck while another, August (d. 1738) served as Archdeacon of St. Lorenz. Alberti also trained for the clergy at Altdorf and in 1701 he published Modum dirigendi omnes actiones nostras ad gloriam Dei (\"The Way to Direct All Our Actions to the Glory of God\"). He then moved to Jena where he studied medicine and was influenced by Georg Wolfgang Wedel, the teacher of Georg Ernst Stahl. Stahl's teaching contrasted the iatromechanistic approaches that were in their infancy at the time. Stahl emphasized a holistic approach to body and soul and Stahlian medicine emphasised the soul as having control on the body. Alberti became an ardent follower of Stahl and received a doctorate in 1704. In 1710 he became an associate professor of medicine and became a full professor at Halle in 1716 just as Stahl moved to Berlin to serve as physician to Prussian King Frederick William I. Here he supervised more than 300 dissertations on medical topics.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Yahya family is a prominent Jewish family of sages, rabbis, and statesmen. Originating in the Iberian Peninsula, the family expanded into Italy and the Ottoman Empire over subsequent generations.\n\n\n== Prominent figures in the Iberian Peninsula ==\nThe progenitor of the Yahya dynasty is widely acknowledged as Don Yahya Ibn Yahya, also referred to as Ibn Yaish, who lived in Lisbon during the 12th century.\nAnother early prominent figure from the family is David Negro Ben Gdalia Yahya, who allied with John I of Castile, during the latter's campaign to take the Portuguese throne in the late 14th century. Following Juan I's defeat, he relocated David Yahya to Castile, where he was conferred the positions of physician, member of the royal committee, and chief rabbi overseeing the Jewish communities within Castile. He died in Toledo in 1385.\nAt the close of the 15th century, two household heads of the Yahya family fled Portugal. One branch relocated to Italy, while the other established itself in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n== Notable members in Italy ==\n\n\n=== Joseph ben David Yahya ===\nHe was born in Lisbon in 1425, and served as an advisor to Kings Afonso V and John II of Portugal. A prominent figure in Portuguese Jewry, he assisted Jewish refugees who sought sanctuary in Portugal following their expulsion from Spain, and he actively opposed any opposition to their migration within Portugal. In 1494, amid considerations by the Portuguese monarchy to enforce the conversion of Jews to Christianity, Yahya and his family fled the country. After a period of hardship, they found refuge in Ferrara. Initially welcomed, Yahya was later accused of aiding conversos (forcibly converted Jews who continued to practice Judaism in secret), subjected to beatings, torture, and a substantial ransom. He died following tortures in Ferrara in 1498.\n\n\n=== David ===\nHis son, David (1465–1543), born in Lisbon in 1465, served as a rabbi, teacher, and educator. Following his escape from Portugal with his father, he settled in Imola, Italy. In 1524, he assumed the role of a rabbi in Rome and subsequently became the rabbi of the Kingdom of Naples. Yahya's educational contributions included teaching Hebrew grammar, the craft of poetry and music, and logic, in addition to instructing on the Book of the Khazar and The Guide for the Perplexed, as documented in his correspondence with state leaders.\nDavid was recognized as an accomplished preacher, even garnering respect from Christian scholars who considered themselves his students. His standing within the Jewish community was further evidenced by the high regard in which he was held by Italy's leading rabbis, who honored his letters. Following the expulsion of Jews from Naples in 1540, Yahya returned to Imola. Despite his extensive writings, only a limited number of his works, including songs, lamentations, and a grammar book, have survived.\n\n\n=== Joseph ===\nJoseph (1494–1539), the son of David, was born in Florence. He was a statesman, businessman, and Talmid Chakham (Torah scholar). During his youth, he studied at the yeshiva of Judah Minz in Padova. After his marriage, he dedicated himself to commerce and amassed wealth, yet he still made time for Torah study.\nIn 1524, Joseph wrote a commentary on the Bible, which he intertwined with contemporary events and political analysis. He also attempted to base the national-religious views of Judah Halevi, viewing the Book of the Khazar as an exemplary work among philosophical approaches. Additionally, he authored a philosophical work on Torah and mitzvot.\nUpon his request, his children relocated his remains to the Land of Israel ten years after his passing, and Rabbi Joseph Karo oversaw their burial.\n\n\n=== Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph ===\n\nGedaliah, born in 1515 in Imola and died circa 1587 in Alexandria, Egypt, was a prolific scholar who wrote approximately 20 books on varied disciplines. He received his education at the yeshiva in Ferrara and subsequently resided in various cities within the Papal States. In 1569, following his expulsion alongside other Jews by Pope Pius V, he lost his fortune. After a period of wandering, he returned to Ferrara and later settled in Alexandria.\nHis most notable work is \"The Chain of Oral Tradition,\" dedicated to Jewish history while also encompassing general chronology, alongside discussions on medicine, magic, numismatics, and metrology.\n\n\n== Notable members in the Ottoman Empire ==\n\n\n=== David ben Shlomo ===\nDavid ben Shlomo (1440–1524), born in Lisbon, was a rabbi, commentator of the Bible, and a medakdek. He died in Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Yaakov Tam ===\nJacob ben David Tam ibn Yahya (c. 1475–1542), also known as Yaakov Tam, was a renowned scholar and posek. He fled Lisbon with his father and was raised in Constantinople amidst a community of scholars. Eventually, he was appointed as a member of the Beth din of Rabbi Elijah Mizrahi. Following Rabbi Mizrahi's passing, Yaakov Tam assumed his role as an instructor, and his teachings resonated throughout the Jewish diaspora, particularly among Sephardic communities, although he was not officially recognized as their leader.\nOne of his notable rulings, or psikot, asserted that Karaites should be regarded as part of the people of Israel, who are obligated to observe Shabbat and holidays since they are bound by the commandments. Yaakov Tam was proficient in Arabic, Turkish, and Spanish, and possessed knowledge of \"the religion of the Ishmaelites\" (i.e. Islam), which led Islamic judges to consult with him on numerous occasions. Many of his writings were lost in a fire a year before his demise. However, the remaining manuscripts were later collected and published in the book \"Tumot Yesharim.\"\n\n\n=== Joseph ===\nJoseph (d. 1573), likely the son of Yaakov Tam, was a distinguished physician who served as court physician to Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan. Joseph accompanied his patron during several journeys and participated in Ottoman military expeditions. According to one source, he died in battle. Additionally, Joseph funded the printing of writings authored by some of his ancestors.\n\n\n=== Gedaliah ===\nGedaliah (d. 1575), son of Yaakov Tam, served as both a rabbi and a physician. He resided in Thessaloniki and Edirne, practicing medicine while also providing leadership to the Jewish communities in these cities and instructing in Torah studies. Around 1548, he returned to Constantinople, where he financially supported scribes engaged in copying scientific works authored by Jewish and Arab scholars.\n\n\n=== Gedaliah ben Moshe ===\nGedaliah ben Moshe (d. 1608), the grandson of Gedaliah, son of Yaakov Tam, was as a prominent figure in Thessaloniki. He established a midrasha dedicated to the study of science and Hebrew poetry, where he delivered lectures on philosophy and poetry. This institution functioned as a gathering point for local poets and scholars to present their works. Additionally, Gedaliah ben Moshe provided assistance to the families of scholars, aiding them during times of adversity. He died young, before his father.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"יחיא [Yahya].\" Encyclopaedia Hebraica, Vol. 19, 1968, pp. 751–753\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "1973 Pakistan coup attempt refers to a plot by Brig. Ali, Major Farouk Adam Khan, Squadron Leader Ghous, Colonel Aleem Afridi and Lt. Colonel Tariq Rafi  against the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to overthrow the government and establish a revolutionary military junta. However Colonel Aleem Afridi played as double agent. He backed down and informed the government about the plot. The coup plotters were arrested,court martialed and jailed.\n\n\n== Background ==\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) had come to power in December 1971 the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan as PPP had won majority seats in the 1970 elections in the then West Pakistan.\n\n\n== Previous role of the plotters ==\nThe coup was plotted by the same group of officers who had actually helped Bhutto to come to power after the Bangladesh Liberation War, these officers forced Yahya Khan to resign and transfer power to Bhutto, by threatening an officer's coup if he didn't comply. Yahya Khan resigned.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nHowever Bhutto after coming to power started dismissing these activist officers as he was weary of them.\nThese officers were enraged and the rebel group of officers began to plot a coup against Bhutto with the help of sympathetic people in the military apparatus.\n\n\n== Coup plotters ==\nOne of the core plotters was Brigadier F B. Ali. He was originally amongst the supporters of Bhutto who had forced Yahya Khan to resign and transfer power to Bhutto.\nBut after his dismissal and dismissal of many of his colleagues he turned against the government and he along with Major Farouk Adam Khan, Squadron Leader Ghous, Colonel Aleem Afridi and Lt. Colonel Tariq Rafi began plotting a coup to bring down Bhutto regime.\n\n\n== Form of government ==\nThey were trying to establish a revolutionary military junta by officers who would oversee the removal of the generals promoted to high positions by Bhutto.\n\n\n== Arrest of coup plotters ==\nColonel Afridi quietly backed out from the plan and then informed the military's top leadership about it. The conspirators were then arrested, court martialed and jailed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Peter's Church is the parish church of Yaxham in Norfolk, England, in the benefice of Mattishall and the Tudd Valley, and in the Diocese of Norwich. It is a round-tower church, dating mostly from the medieval period. The building is Grade I listed.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe earliest part of the church is the banding of carstone at the base of the tower, which probably predates the Norman conquest. The rest of the tower dates from the late 11th or early 12th century, with the upper part dating from the 14th century, with four bell-openings, each of two lights, and a post-medieval crenellated parapet. Most of the rest of the building is of the 14th and 15th centuries. There is a nave with a south aisle and four clerestory windows, and a chancel. There is a late-medieval south porch.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe 14th-century south arcade has four bays, with alternating foiled and octagonal piers. The octagonal font, carved with blind tracery and with crocketted finials, is of the 15th century. There is a medieval piscina in the south aisle, and a later piscina in the chancel.There was restoration in the 19th century; the stained-glass windows are from this period. The ends of the pews, of the 19th or 20th century, are decorated in the south aisle with carvings of birds and animals.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to St Peter's, Yaxham at Wikimedia Commons",

He ruled just a couple of months between 1698 and 1700.\n\n\n== Rule ==\nHe began his rule in 1698 after his predecessor Hadj Ahmed(fr) was murdered by Janissaries, Unlike Ahmed, Hassen was the complete opposite of him, ha was considerate as a moderate and calm. All thought he managed to keep the good relations with the kingdom of France made by Hadj Ahmed Chabane, when a French diplomat who wanted to ruin diplomatic times between the two states, named M. de Forbin rescued a bunch of other Christian slaves on a French fleet called the Téméraire from Algiers. Even with the break-down of two riots in the capital, Hassan managed to calm the situation with his goodwill.\nWhen the Bey of Tunis Mourad III, Algerian Janissaries rose up against Hassan forcing him to resign from his title of bey to the Divan of Algiers, who decided that his Agha Hadj Mustapha would take the title of Dey. After that he would be sent to Tripoli where he probably died there.\n\n\n== References ==",

One-third of the 60 members of Oldham Council in Greater Manchester will be elected.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Labour Party have governed Oldham for most of its history. They held a majority on the council from its creation in 1973 to 1994, when they lost control against the national trend. They regained a majority the following year, but lost control to the Liberal Democrats in 2000. Labour regained control in 2003, before losing their majority in 2006. Labour again won a majority in 2011, and have formed majority administrations since then, albeit with reduced margins.\nThe 2023 election was the first election on the current ward boundaries; as a result, all seats were up for election. Labour won 32 seats with 46.5% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats won 10 with 17.7%, the Conservatives won 11 with 17.6%, the Failsworth Independent Party won 3 with 2.1%, and independents won 4 with 14.3%. The 2024 election is for seats held by councillors elected by the smallest number of votes in each ward; Labour are defending 12 seats, the Liberal Democrats are defending 4, the Conservatives are defending 3, and the Failsworth Independent Party are defending 1.\n\n\n== Previous council composition ==\n\nChanges:\n\nNovember 2023: Kamran Ghafoor, Muhammad Irfan, and Abdul Wahid suspended from Conservatives\nJanuary 2024: Aftab Hussain (independent) joins Labour\nApril 2024: Shoab Akhtar and Nyla Ibrahim leave Labour to sit as independents\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Ward results ==\nAn asterisk denotes an incumbent councillor seeking re-election.\n\n\n=== Alexandra ===\n\n\n=== Chadderton Central ===\n\n\n=== Chadderton North ===\n\n\n=== Chadderton South ===\n\n\n=== Coldhurst ===\n\n\n=== Crompton ===\n\n\n=== Failsworth East ===\n\n\n=== Failsworth West ===\n\n\n=== Hollinwood ===\n\n\n=== Medlock Vale ===\n\n\n=== Royton North ===\n\n\n=== Royton South ===\n\n\n=== Saddleworth North ===\n\n\n=== Saddleworth South ===\n\n\n=== Saddleworth West and Lees ===\n\n\n=== Shaw ===\n\n\n=== St James' ===\n\n\n=== St Mary's ===\n\n\n=== Waterhead ===\n\n\n=== Werneth ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Agra site south of Leipzig in Germany includes an exhibition center as well as a green space with a total surface area of 190 hectares (470 acres). The combination of a natural area and an event complex originated from the concomitance of a horticultural exhibition and an agricultural fair in the early years of the German Democratic Republic. The GDR agricultural fair named Agra gave its name to the site.\nWith a covered exhibition area of 13,000 square metres (140,000 square feet), a car park with 250 spaces and an annual attendance of 750,000 visitors, it is the second largest event complex in Leipzig after the Leipzig fairgrounds of the Leipzig Trade Fair in the north of the city. The landscaped park includes a number of monuments distributed between meadows, gardens, bodies of water and groves. The park includes museums, for example, the Deutsches Fotomuseum (German Photo Museum), the Dölitz gatehouse and the watermill on the Mühlpleiße river.\nThe site is intended for different types of fairs, exhibitions as well as festivals. It notably hosts the Wave-Gotik-Treffen, one of the largest Gothic festivals in the world, the medieval festival named Mittelalterlich Phantasie Spectaculum, the Tattoo & Lifestyle exhibition as well as the Fest der 25.000 Lichter (Festival of 25,000 lights), where the public comes equipped with lanterns, candles or any other sources of light. Every year in October, a historical reenactment of the battle of Leipzig takes place.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe agra is located in the Leipzig borough of Dölitz and in its western and southern parts in Markkleeberg. The exhibition center is accessed from the east side, via Bornaische Straße. The Bundesstraße 2 traverses the agra as an elevated roadway. There are discussions to build a tunnel instead of that. To the west of the park is the city of Markkleeberg and to the south is Markkleeberg Lake.\nThe 190 hectares (470 acres) of land are divided into two zones:\n\nthe landscape park named Agra-Park extends to the north, west and south of the area. The northern park is made up of Goethe Park, Dölitz Wood (Dölitzer Holz) and the eastern part of Herfurth Park, named in honor of the landowner Paul Herfurth who inspired its design. The northern part is bounded by the Mühlpleiße river to the east (which forms the boundary with the exhibition park) and Bundesstraße 2 as well as the Pleiße river to the west. The southern part located in Markkleeberg is a green area between the Pleiße and the small Pleiße (Kleine Pleiße). The western part of the park is also covered by the Herfurth Park consisting of a pond, the “beech lawn” (in German language: Buchen-Liegewiese) as well as several monuments and museums.\nthe exhibition center (agra-Messegelände) is located to the east of the area. It is notably made up of three T-shaped halls and open spaces. Hall 1 is 5,518 square metres (59,400 square feet), Hall 2 is 4,750 square metres (51,100 square feet) and Hall 4 is 3,000 square metres (32,000 square feet) (there is no Hall 3). In the middle of the three halls is a vestibule (ground floor) and a forum (first floor).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the current site, shared and co-managed between Leipzig and Markkleeberg, dates back to the 19th century. In 1889, Paul Herfurth (1855–1937), a liberal publisher and politician, acquired a meadow between Städtelner Strasse (today Raschwitzer Strasse) and the Pleiße and settled there with his family. His family remained there after his death but the land was expropriated from them in 1945.\nThe first horticultural exhibition of local horticulturists was organized in 1948 on the site, which expanded significantly in the years that followed. Under the leadership of the agronomist Oskar Baumgarten (1907–2008), the first agricultural exhibition in the GDR was opened on site in 1952. Building on its success, the exhibition under the name of agra Markkleeberg will be repeated every year. The exhibition center was then developed.\nAfter the horticultural exhibition moved to Erfurt in 1960, its site was transformed into a public park, which represents the center of today's park. Various fairs and exhibitions multiplied there and success was assured: the Agra events welcomed up to half a million people, including more than 10,000 foreigners from around a hundred different countries. In 1969 alone, the Agra received 750,000 visitors. Dozens of mobile halls and pavilions were erected each year.\nAfter German reunification, the site lost some of its importance. Several fairs and exhibitions have moved to the newly built Leipzig exhibition grounds (opened 1996), including the agricultural fair. Since 2005, the green spaces and the exhibition park have been managed separately. It is planned that the natural space will be expanded to accommodate events that are more integrated into nature.\n\n\n== Monuments and museums ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIn general\nAgra-Park, Markkleeberg, in English\nAll about the Agra Park in Markkleeberg and Leipzig, in German\nMuseums and monuments\nGatehouse Dölitz with Tin Figures Museum, in German\nGatehouse Markkleeberg with Battle of Leipzig Museum, in German\nDeutsches Fotomuseum (German Photo Museum), in German\nDölitz Watermill, in German\nHistory\nHistory of the „agra“ exhibitions and trade fairs in Markkleeberg, in German\nHistory of the Agra-Park, in German\n„agra“-puppet\nOverview agra-Park und -area, future plannings, in German\nMarkets\nAgra Antique Market, in English",

        "content": "Fluff My Life is a graphic novel written and illustrated by Skottie Young that was released in five parts throughout 2016 by Image Comics as the second volume of the American comic book series I Hate Fairyland, set in the Image Universe. Part 1, Fluff My Life was released on June 15, 2016, Part 2, How to Drain Your Dragon, was released on July 20, 2016, Part 3, Put Your Quarter Up (co-illustrated by Jeffrey \"Chamba\" Cruz), was released on August 17, 2016, Part 4, Splat in the Hat, was released on September 21, 2016, and Part 5, Final Fantasy, was released on October 19, 2016.\nThe series follows Gertrude \"Gert\", a bitter, hard-drinking, sarcastic, murderous young woman who has spent decades on a \"one-day quest\" through Fairyland on being transported there for the key that will allow her to go home, trapped as her unageing six-year-old self with pretty green curls and a bow, and accompanied by her equally sarcastic, top-hat-wearing housefly quest companion Larry. Now the Queen of Fairyland, Gert inadvertently brings ruin to the kingdom before seeking out a new route of returning home. Preceded by Madly Ever After, it is followed by the story arc Good Girl.\nThe series has received a universally positive critical reception.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn April 2016, Skottie Young revealed the second story arc of I Hate Fairyland, ultimately entitled Fluff My Life, would be set in a \"weird Bloodsport, Street Fighter Arcade Land – doing a little bit more, I don't want to call them \"one and dones,\" but maybe just a little bit more episodic nature of storytelling allows\", on consulting with uncredited I Hate Fairyland co-creator Jason Howard from having Madly Ever After as \"your movie\" with Madly Ever After, subsequent arcs would comprise \"your television show\", featuring guest artist Jeffrey \"Chamba\" Cruz in a \"fun stylized story sequence\" in the third part, and publishing imagery of I Hate Fairyland cosplayers who had taken to Madly Ever After with the first, while describing the narrative as:\n\n\"[Something] I didn’t get to do in the first arc of the series [was to] explore the weirdness of Fairyland, so in [Fluff My Life] I'm going to do that. It's going to be less driven by big plots. Each issue will be a little story with an overall thing to tie the stories together over time. In one issue, we might catch Gert playing poker in Las Fugus and end up lost inside Larry's hat. In another issue, we could see her end up in a Street Fighter blood sport tournament. All these things can happen because the world is endless. We’re going to focus on the character and her mishaps and adventures. We're going to slow down and unfold a big plot slowly over the next couple arcs rather than stuff it into five issues– like a TV show. It keeps things fresh for me and for readers.\"\nIn October 2016, Young retrospectively described Fluff My Life as having been about \"building up Gert's [own] stamina for this world [strolling] along, taking time to look around the place, soaking in the scenery. Also a blast [like Madly Ever After], just in a different way. Treating the first two arcs completely differently [having been] my way of showing the different ways I'll be approaching this book for the rest of the run. It's a free-for-all, and anything goes!\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFluff My Life at Image Comics",

        "content": "DotCode is two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode invented in 2008 by Hand Held Products company to replace outdated Code 128. At this time, it is issued by Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility (AIM) as “ISS DotCode Symbology Specification 4.0”. DotCode consists of sparse black round dots and white spaces on white background. In case of black background round dots, creating barcode, can be white. DotCode was developed to use with high-speed industrial printers where printing accuracy can be low. Because DotCode by the standard does not require complicated elements like continuous lines or special shapes it can be applied with laser engraving  or industrial drills.\nDotCode can be represented as rectangular array with minimal size of each side 5X dots. Maximal size of DotCode is not limited by the standard (as Code 128 is not limited) but practical limit is recommended as 100x99: 5.2.1.4  which can encode around 730 digits, 366 alphanumeric characters or 304 bytes.\nAs an extension of Code 128 barcode, DotCode allows more compact encoding of 8-bit data array and Unicode support with Extended Channel Interpretation feature. Additionally, DotCode provides much more data density and Reed–Solomon error correction which allows to restore partially damaged barcode. However, the main DotCode implementation, the same as Code 128, is effective encoding of GS1 data which is used in worldwide shipping and packaging industry.\n\n\n== History and standards ==\nDotCode barcode was invented in 2008 by Dr. Andrew Longacre from Hand Held Products company and standardized in 2009 by AIM as “Bar code symbology specification - DotCode”. In 2019 DotCode was reviewed as “ISS DotCode Symbology Specification 4.0”.\nSet of patents is registered, which are related with DotCode encoding and decoding:\n\nUnited States Patent US20090200386A1 by Hand Held Products Inc \"Machine readable 2D symbology printable on demand\"\nUnited States Patent US20090200386A1 by Datalogic IP Tech SRL \"System and method for extracting bitstream data in two-dimensional optical codes\"\nChinese Patent CN113297872A by Fuzhou Symbol Information Technology Co ltd \"Dotcode identification method and equipment\"\n\n\n== Application ==\nDotCode barcode can be used in the same way as Code 128 or any (2D) matrix barcode. At this time, it is used mostly to encode GS1 data in tobacco, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage, pharmaceutical and grocery industries. The main implementation at this time is in tobacco industry.\nMain advantages of DotCode are:\n\nFull support and replacement of Code 128 codeset;\nCompact encoding of 8-bit data array;\nUnicode support with Extended Channel Interpretation feature;\nEffective encoding of GS1 data;\nReed–Solomon error correction\nAbility to apply the barcode by high-speed industrial printers and other methods like laser engraving.\n\n\n== Barcode design ==\nDotCode represents data in rectangular structure which consists from black round dots and white spaces on white background or white round dots on black background. DotCode does not have finder pattern, like other 2D barcodes and it must be detected with slow blob detection algorithms like Gabor filter or Circle Hough Transform. All data, metadata and error correction codewords are encoded in the same dots array which does not have any visual difference.\nHere are some samples of DotCode: \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nDotCode symbol is constructed from the following elements:: 5.1 \n\nTwo mask bits which are represented on diagram as two green points;\nData bits (data and error correction bits) which must be read from up to down (even barcode side) and from left to right (odd barcode side);\nCorner points, marked as red on diagram, which can be used as data bits or padding bits (black dots);\nQuiet zone at least 3X size of the dots.\nThe DotCode bits array is represented as:\n(Two mask bits: M2, M1)(Data bits)(Corner bits, can be data or padding bits: C1 – C6)\nThe data codewords in 0 – 112 range are encoded in 5-of-9 binary dot patterns: 5.2  which are encoded from 9 dots where 5 black dots and 4 white spaces. The rest of barcode matrix (rest from division on 9) is padded with black padding bits.: 5.2.3  The padding bits can be from 0 to 8. The logically DotCode bits array is represented as:\n(2 mask bits)(Data codewords 9 bits each)(Padding bits 0 – 8 bits)\nDotCode size has the following requirements:: 5.1 \n\nSum of DotCode width and height must be odd: \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        W\n        +\n        H\n        )\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          2\n          )\n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (W+H){\\pmod {2}}=1}\n  \n;\nMinimal size of each side must be 5, maximal is not limited;\nIt is recommended to use width and height to have at least 6 padding black bits where data bits capacity rest from division on 9 more or equal 6:: 5.2.1.4  \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        <=\n        (\n        (\n        (\n        W\n        ∗\n        H\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        )\n        −\n        2\n        )\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          9\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6<=(((W*H)/2)-2){\\pmod {9}}}\n  \n\n\n=== Data masking ===\nTo minimize DotCode problematic symbols, the data codewords are masked to create others visual sequences. The mask pattern is applied only to data sequence and does not affect error correction codewords. DotCode standard has 4 mask pattern which are codded into 2 bits and placed as the first 2 bits of symbol bits array.: 5.2.4 \n\n\n=== Error correction ===\nDotCode uses Reed–Solomon error correction: 5.3  with prime power of 3 and finite field \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            113\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{113}}\n  \n or GF(113). The data codewords is represented with values from 0 to 112 and mask value is counted as leading data codeword from 0 to 3. In this way the data protected array length is (1 + ND). But amount of error correction codewords is calculated only from ND:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        C\n        =\n        3\n        +\n        (\n        N\n        D\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NC=3+(ND/2)}\n  \n,\nwhere ND is data codewords and NC - error correction codewords.\nThe resulting codewords NW with error correction codewords is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        W\n        =\n        (\n        1\n        +\n        N\n        D\n        )\n        +\n        N\n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NW=(1+ND)+NC}\n  \n,\nwhere NW is all encoding codewords: 1 mask codeword + data codewords(ND) + error correction codewords(NC).\nBecause Reed–Solomon error correction cannot correct amount of codewords which are more than polynomial, if NW happens to exceed 112, the data is split into error correction blocks:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        =\n        (\n        N\n        W\n        +\n        111\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        112\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B=(NW+111)/112}\n  \n,\nwhere B is block counts.\nThe data can be split into block in the following way, for each block ‘’’n’’’, for n equals 1 to B:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        D\n        (\n        b\n        l\n        o\n        c\n        k\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        (\n        1\n        +\n        N\n        D\n        )\n        −\n        (\n        n\n        −\n        1\n        )\n        +\n        (\n        B\n        −\n        1\n        )\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ND(block)=((1+ND)-(n-1)+(B-1))/B}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        W\n        (\n        b\n        l\n        o\n        c\n        k\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        N\n        W\n        −\n        (\n        n\n        −\n        1\n        )\n        +\n        (\n        B\n        −\n        1\n        )\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NW(block)=(NW-(n-1)+(B-1))/B}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        C\n        (\n        b\n        l\n        o\n        c\n        k\n        )\n        =\n        N\n        W\n        (\n        b\n        l\n        o\n        c\n        k\n        )\n        −\n        N\n        D\n        (\n        b\n        l\n        o\n        c\n        k\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NC(block)=NW(block)-ND(block)}\n  \n\nThe error correction data \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NC}\n  \n is written after single data block \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ND}\n  \n in scrambled mode:\n(ND)(NC1_1)(NC2_1)(NC3_1)...(NC1_n)(NC2_m)(NC3_k)\n\n\n== Encoding ==\nDotCode encoding size is not limited by standard, but practical encoding size in 100x99 version which includes 4950 dots can encode 366 raw data codewords, 730 digits, 365 alphanumeric characters, or 304 bytes. The data message in DotCode is represented with data codewords from 0 to 112 which are encoded with 5-of-9 binary dot patterns.\nDotCode supports the following features:: 5.2.1 \n\nNatively encodes digits or ASCII charset (between 0 and 127) with A, B and C code sets and extended ASCII values (128 to 255) with Upper Shift;\nEffectively encodes bytes (5 bytes into 6 codewords) with Binary Latch;\nEncodes GS1 data;\nEncodes Unicode symbols with Extended Channel Interpretation feature;\nSupports Structured append encoding (logically using multiple barcode symbols as single data stream);\nSupports “Macro” encoding.\n\nThere three main rules at message encoding start:\n\nThe default starting encoding is Code Set C;\nIn case of two digits in Code Set C (0 – 100 value) are encoded in the position of the first codeword, the message is decoded as GS1 message;\nIf FNC1 (opposite effect to Code 128)  or other non-digit codeword (101 - 112) is encoded in the position of the first codeword, the message is decoded as NON GS1 message.\n\n\n=== Binary byte encoding ===\nDotCode can encode full 8-bit charset in two ways:: 5.2.1.1 \n\nWith Upper Shift, which requires 2 codewords on one (128 to 255) symbol;\nWith Binary Latch, which requires 1 Binary Latch symbol and 6 codewords on every 5 bytes.\nUpper Shift modes can encode (128 to 255) extended ASCII characters in two codewords with returning to previous mode:\n\nBinary Latch mode can encode 8-bit charset and ECI sequences from 1 to 5 symbols. It uses the following rules:\n\nThe data is split into block of 5 symbols (byte or ECI mode identifier) or 6 codewords;\n0 – 258 values are radix converted from five base 259 into six base 103 values;\n0 – 255 values are byte values;\n256, 257 or 258 values marks to encode ECI sequence in next 1, 2 or 3 bytes respectively;\nAny DotCode codewords in the encoded sequence above 102 (from 103 to 112) interrupt or change mode.\n\nAs we see in the following table, Binary Latch encodes data more effectively, starting from 3 bytes.\n\n\n=== ECI encoding ===\nDotCode can encode ECI indicator int two ways:: 5.2.1.2 \n\nIn Binary Latch mode (reviewed upper);\nWith FNC2 character.\nFNC2 in any position except at the end of data signals the insertion of an ECI sequence – \"\\nnnnnn\", which represents values between 000000 and 811799. The values can be encoded in 1 or 3 codewords:\n\nIn case of next codeword < 40 directly encodes ECI value 000000 to 000039;\nOtherwise, the next three codewords valued A, B, & C encode an ECI value of \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        A\n        −\n        40\n        )\n        ∗\n        12769\n        +\n        B\n        ∗\n        113\n        +\n        C\n        +\n        40\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (A-40)*12769+B*113+C+40}\n  \n.\n\n\n=== GS1 encoding ===\nAny two digits in the position of the first codeword identify a symbol as GS1 encoded (opposite to Code 128). In case of symbol with two digits in the position of the first codeword must be decoded as ordinary data, the FNC1 (omitted in decoded message) must be inserted at the place of the first codeword.: 5.2.1.2  FNC1 in the other than the first position works as GS1 Application Identifier splitter and decoded as GS (ASCII value 29) character.\nCodeword 100 in Code Set C encodes application GS1 AI (17) the next 3 codewords is an expiration date and inserts GS1 AI (10) before decoding other codewords:\n(100)(24)(12)(30)(56)(64) -> 17241230105664\n\n\n=== Macros mode ===\nSome data codewords 97 – 100 in the lead data position in Code Set B can encode “Macros”.: 5.2.1.1  In any other position it encodes ASCII symbol:\n(Latch B)(HT) -> [)>RS05GS … RSEoT\n(Shift B)(HT) -> [)>RS05GS … RSEoT\n\n\n=== Structured append ===\nDotCode can create composite symbol, where data from multiple DotCode symbols can be logically united. This can be made with FNC2 symbol in last data position. When FNC2 is in the final data position,: 5.2.1.2  then the preceding two message characters, digits and uppercase letters in order 1 to 9 then A to Z (for values 10 to 35) shall as \"m\" and \"n\" designate where this message belongs in a \"m out of n\" sequence. As an example, a symbol whose message ends \"4 B FNC2\" shall be the 4th symbol out of 11 that comprise the entire message.\n\n\n=== Special modes encoding ===\nFNC3 in the first codeword position indicates that the message: 5.2.1.2  is the instructions for initialization or reprogramming of the bar code reader.\nFNC3 in any other position than first indicates that encoded message must be logically separated into two distinct messages (before and after it);\n\n\n=== Data padding ===\nDotCode symbol codewords capacity is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        W\n        =\n        (\n        (\n        H\n        ∗\n        W\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        −\n        2\n        )\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          9\n          )\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle NW=((H*W)/2-2){\\pmod {9}})}\n  \n\nDotCode symbol data codewords capacity is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        D\n        =\n        (\n        N\n        W\n        −\n        3\n        )\n        −\n        (\n        N\n        W\n        −\n        3\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ND=(NW-3)-(NW-3)/3}\n  \n\nIn this way we need to pad data codewords in case with have free space. There are two rules:: 5.2.3 \n\nBinary mode must be terminated with Latch to Code Set A (codeword 109);\nIn other modes codeword 106 (Latch to Code Set C / Latch to Code Set B) must be used.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomated identification and data capture (AIDC)\nBarcode\nCode 128\nExtended Channel Interpretation\nGS1\nHand Held Products\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDotCode patent\nFree DotCode generator\nFree DotCode reader",

        "content": "The Jambur Solar Power Station (JSPS), is an operational 23 MW (31,000 hp)  solar power plant in Gambia. The power station began commercial operations in March 2024. It is owned and was developed by the government of Gambia, with funding from the European Union, the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. The power generated here is integrated into the Gambian national electricity grid, through the National Water and Electricity Company network.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe power station is located in the community called \"Jambur\", in Kombo North District, in the Brikama Local Government Area, southwest of Banjul, the capital city of the country and south of the Gambia River. Jambur Solar Power Station sits on approximately 31.1 hectares (77 acres) of land, about 37.5 kilometres (23 mi), southwest of the city of Banjul.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nJambur Solar Power Station, is a component of the \"Gambia Electricity Restoration and Modernization Project\" (GERMP), a US$165 million infrastructure project financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Union (EU) and the World Bank (WB). The GERMP comprises the erection of the 23 MW JSPS, the construction and connection of an 8MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), the improvement of transmission and distribution electricity network in the country and the improvement of electricity connections to schools and health facilities. The project is expected to create 1,250 direct jobs during the construction, operation and maintenance phases.\n\n\n== Developers ==\nThe power station was developed by the Gambian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and The National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC), with funding from the EIB, EU and the WB.\n\n\n== Construction costs, funding, and commissioning ==\nThe engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract was awarded to Tebian Electric Apparatus (TBEA), a Chinese engineering and construction company. TBEA was also awarded a three-year operations and maintenance (O&M) contract. The table below illustrates the sources of funding for the (GERMP) infrastructure project.\n\nNote: Totals may be slightly off due to rounding.\nConstruction began in February 2023. Commercial commissioning was achieved in March 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSoma Solar Power Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGambia Inaugurates 23 MWp Solar PV Plant To Revolutionize Energy Sector\nA Landmark Solar PV Plant Has Been Inaugurated In The Gambia",

She was awarded the Dorothy Hill Medal by the Australian Academy of Science in 2024,  experience in science communication.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMuch of Gallant's education and research involves climate variability and climate extremes of the Southern Hemisphere. She has focussed on climate extremes including drought, extreme heat and heavy rainfall.\nGallant's research interests specifically include:\n\nExamining processes which influence variations in Australian drought.\nCharacterising decadal to multi-decadal scale variability in climate within the Southern Hemisphere.\nInterpreting variability in the pre-instrumental climate using palaeoclimate data, together with understanding dynamical explanations for past climate variability. Gallant was the National Secretary of AMOS from 2007 to 2010 and a partner investigator on CRC for Water Sensitive Cities.\nGallant worked at the University of Melbourne, and in 2024 was an associate professor at Monash University, and the Monash Node Lead of the National Environmental Science Program Climate Systems Hub. Gallant is a Chief Investigator of the ARC Centre of Excellence of 21st Century Weather.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGallant received an honours degree from Monash University, and in 2009, she received a PhD for her thesis titled \"Trends in extremes of the Australian Climate\", also from Monash. She worked at the University of Melbourne (2009–2011) and University of Washington (2011–2012) in post-doctoral positions.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n2016 – Gallant, A. J. E. and S. C.

        "content": "Kirati Promsaka na Sakon Nakhon (Thai: กีรติ พรหมสาขา ณ สกลนคร, born January 25, 1952), also widely known by his stage name Keo Carabao (เขียว คาราบาว) is a Thai singer, musician and sound engineer. Known as one of the members of Carabao. He is a pioneering member of the band alongside Yuenyong Opakul or Aed Carabao.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nKirati or Keo was born in Bangkok's Thonburi side. He grew up being raised by his mother who was a teacher. His father died when he was four years old. Keo graduated from high school from Suankularb Wittayalai School. Originally he liked playing football very much and had the potential to be a skilled footballer. Keo turned to music and started from guitar after being taught by his senior footballer friend who was also a musician. His mother didn't approve of it at all and did her best to dissuade him, but he tried to run away from home to play music. \n\n\n=== Carabao member ===\nHe co-founded Carabao in the Philippines together with two fellow Thai students were Yuenyoung Opakul or Aed and Sanit Limsila or Khai, while traveling to study at Mapúa Institute of Technology (modern-day Mapúa University or MU) in 1977.\nIn 1981, after graduation Keo had returned to Thailand. He worked as an engineer for a Filipino company that opened a branch in Thailand, along with playing music with Aed on behalf of Carabao. At the end of that same year, Carabao released their first album titled Khii Maw (ขี้เมา, \"The Drunken\"). In this album, he was one of the two who wrote the song Mon Phleng Kharabao (มนต์เพลงคาราบาว, \"Magical Songs of Carabao\") with Aed, the first Carabao's song.\nHe membered Carabao until their 10th album Haam Chot Khwaai (ห้ามจอดควาย, \"No Buffalo Parking\") in 1990 when he left the band. In this album, there was one song that he sung Sanya Na Fon (สัญญาหน้าฝน, \"Rainy Season Promise\"), with lyrics by Aed Carabao.

        "content": "Irene González Hernández (La Orotava, October 20, 1969-Tucson, February 13, 2014) was a Spanish researcher and astrophysicist, promoter of the development of holographic techniques in local helioseismology, which allow detecting solar activity in the non-visible hemisphere of the Sun.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGonzález graduated in physics, specializing in Astrophysics, in 1992 at the University of La Laguna. Subsequently, she obtained an FPI Scholarship to carry out her doctoral thesis at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands, IAC), within the Solar Seismology Group. Her work was focused on the scientific exploitation of the new high-quality data that the Global Oscillation Network Group project was providing, one of whose instruments, and nodes, was located at the Teide Observatory.\nHer thesis, titled Synoptic map of transverse flows in the upper layers of the solar convection zone (Mapa sinóptico de flujos transversales en las capas altas de la zona de convección solar), was directed by astrophysicist Jesús Patrón. In this work, the \"ring diagram\" technique was improved and expanded for the precise obtaining of horizontal velocity fluxes below the solar surface from measurements of solar oscillations, which became a new discipline within solar physics.\nIn April 1998, she obtained her Doctorate in Astrophysics, which was followed by various stays in research centers, which took her to the National Solar Observatory (NSO), to Stanford University, and to the Queen Mary University of London in the United Kingdom. In 2001 she temporarily ceased its research activity.\nIn 2003, she returned to the NSO with a senior research contract to lead a project developing holographic techniques that detect solar activity in the non-visible hemisphere of the Sun. González developed this new technique, which allows predicting fundamental characteristics of the activity that should appear in the visible hemisphere due to the rotation movement. Its implications in the so-called Space weather, or Space Meteorology, have made it a reference in that field of research. She passed away in 2014.\n\n\n== Works ==\n2014 - Solar Origins of Space Weather and Space Climate. Springer. ISBN 978-1493911813.\n\n\n== Awards & recognitions ==\nIn 2014, having already died, at the helioseismology congress HELAS VI/ SOHO 28/SPACEINN her career was remembered in the session The Legacy of Irene González Hernández. That same year, the mini planet 90455 Irenehernandez (2004CU2) was named in her memory, in recognition of González's contributions to the knowledge of the Sun.\nIn 2015, the La Orotova City Council honored her with a plaque and a central street in her hometown. At the same time, the Secondary Education Institute, IES La Orotava, began the Irene González Hernández Science and Technology Conference, which has continued annually. A couple of years later, in 2017, the Villa de Arriba municipal children's school in the municipality of La Orotava was inaugurated with her name.\nIn 2021, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FFECYT) and the Spanish Astronomy Society (SEA) held the exhibition titled AstrónomAs in which González was featured.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hangover (Suzanne Valadon) (French: Gueule de Bois / La Buveuse), also known as The Drinker, is an oil on canvas painting by French post-Impressionist artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, created from 1887 to 1889, just before he became successful as an artist. The painting depicts a drunken woman drinking alone in a club, reflecting the counterculture of Montmartre and the specter of alcoholism among French women at the time. The model in The Hangover is artist Suzanne Valadon, Lautrec's lover.  In the early 1880s, after falling from a circus trapeze at the age of 15 and suffering a back injury, Valadon was forced to switch careers and began working as an art model in Montmartre.  Although she had been drawing all her life, by 1883, she had become an artist herself, and she would go on to become the first woman painter admitted to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.\nFrench cabaret singer and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant is thought to have influenced both the content and the choice of title, although there is some disagreement about this. Lautrec's technique is loosely reminiscent of both the color theory of Neo-Impressionism and the technique of Lautrec's art school friend Vincent van Gogh. The work was preceded by a preparatory study for the painting in pastel and followed by a drawing in ink and chalk that was later published in Le Courrier français in 1889. Lautrec drank copious amounts of alcohol to deal with pain from his assumed underlying genetic disorder which left him disabled.  This and the syphilis he later acquired due to his habit of frequenting brothels would later contribute to his death at the young age of 36. The work is held by the Fogg Museum, while the study and drawing are both held by the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec. The Hangover is one of several different works by Lautrec featuring Suzanne Valadon, most notably two portraits, Portrait of Suzanne Valadon (1885) in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes,  and Portrait of the Painter Suzanne Valadon in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901) came from aristocratic family related to the counts of Toulouse.  Originally from Albi in southern France, his parents separated when he was young and he later moved to Paris with his mother. Toulouse-Lautrec was disabled, possibly due to a genetic disorder known as pycnodysostosis.  His birth parents were cousins, so there is speculation that his health problems came about due to their intermarriage. Lautrec's legs remained child-sized, but his torso continued to grow as an adult.  He required a cane to walk, and he would do so hunched over, which would invite derogatory comments about his appearance. Lautrec trained as a painter in Paris under Léon Bonnat and Fernand Cormon.  He took up residence in Montmartre, well known for its connection to the arts since the 12th century era of Louis VI, who was a notable patron. The attraction of jobs and low rents brought many people to the district.  In the late 19th century, Montmartre was inhabited by \"small tradesmen, entertainers, petty criminals, prostitutes, artists...those of Spanish, Flemish, [and] northern French...descent...poor workers, mattress menders and circus performers...factory workers, seamstresses, laundresses and artisans\".\nBetween 1884 and 1889, French laundress Carmen Gaudin modeled for Lautrec for some 15 paintings.  In the late 1880s, Lautrec began working on a series of large paintings based on the Cirque Fernando, a popular French circus in Montmartre.  His friend and colleague, Italian Impressionist painter Federico Zandomeneghi (1841–1917), recommended his own model, Marie-Clémentine Valadon, who began working as an art model after injuring herself as a circus trapeze artist at the age of 15. Taking Zandomeneghi up on his offer, Lautrec hired Valadon to pose for one of his circus scenes which he then expanded into a larger series. Lautrec's circus works show Valadon riding side-saddle on a horse as she is about to dive through a hoop held by a clown.  They were later prominently featured at the Moulin Rouge, and were said to be so influential that it led Georges Seurat (1859–1891), Pierre Bonnard (1867–1947), and Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) to try their hand at similar circus scenes in homage to Lautrec. By that time, Valadon had already modeled for Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and  Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Previously, in 1884, Lautrec famously parodied Puvis' painting of The Sacred Grove, Beloved of the Arts and Muses by creating his own humorous version of it.  Valadon, as it turns out, was the original model for most of the figures in that painting. Sociologist Janet M.C. Burns of the University of New Brunswick notes that \"it was Toulouse-Lautrec who first encouraged [Valadon's] intellectual and artistic development\".  He was the first person to buy her artwork and he also gave her the idea to change her name from Marie to \"Suzanne\".\nThe outsider French subculture of sex work held a special appeal for Lautrec, perhaps because he was also an outsider as a disabled man in 19th century French society. He also had easy access to prostitutes given his obsession with brothels (maisons closes) and his commercial work for venues like the Moulin Rouge, where prostitutes worked in secret behind closed doors. Whatever the case may be, Lautrec completed around 50 paintings featuring prostitution, none of which were exhibited or known until after he died.  By the 1890s, the successful cabaret scene began to experience a downturn due to its eventual exploitation. Le Mirliton closed in 1897, bringing the Montmartre countercultural era to an end. Lautrec sunk deeper into the depths of alcohol abuse in his final years, using a hollowed-out walking cane surreptitiously filled with alcohol, complete with a hidden glass, to hide his drinking from his family. In March 1899, Lautrec's family had him \"kidnapped\" while he was drunk to try and treat his alcohol problem.  When he awoke, he found himself in a locked room in the Chateau Saint-James asylum.  Several months later, he was released, but his health continued to get worse.  In 1901, he died at his family home at the age of 36.\n\n\n== Development ==\nToulouse-Lautrec's friendship with singer and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant is thought to have influenced his development of The Hangover, with some art historians arguing that the image derives from parts of a song Bruant wrote about drinking. Other art historians, like Gale Murray and David Sweetman, disagree. According to John Storm, Valadon modeled for The Hangover for fun and amusement, not as a paid modeling job.  It was, Storm writes, \"an experience they shared in high spirits, a little private joke that came as an aftermath of one of Lautrec's less inhibited parties\". Lautrec may have begun working on the painting sometime before February 1888. It is also believed that the relationship between Lautrec and Valadon was over sometime around or after February.  Van Gogh was present in Lautrec's studio when he began painting The Hangover, and he continued to show interest in it as Lautrec worked on it.  Art critic Henri Perruchot implies this was because Lautrec had borrowed elements from Van Gogh's technique of crosshatching. Previously, Lautrec had used Van Gogh's technique in his Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887), which depicts the artist with a glass of absinthe in a nightclub.  Van Gogh was living in Arles in the summer of 1888. He wrote a letter to his brother asking about the painting, indicating he was still curious about what Lautrec was trying to do: \"Has de Lautrec finished his picture of the woman leaning on her elbows on a little table in a café?\" Perruchot argues that in its execution, The Hangover combines \"the aesthetic influence of Van Gogh and the moral influence of Bruant\", while art historian Jacques Lassaigne notes that \"the influence of [Van Gogh's] technique is manifest.\" Gale Murray notes the influence of Neo-Impressionist color theory in the painting. The completed work was one of ten paintings by Lautrec that was on permanent exhibition at Le Mirliton, Bruant's club.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA woman sits alone inside a cafe at one of two round tables near a pillar, leaning on the table with her elbows.  Appearing in profile, her ear and forehead is hidden by her hair, tied back in a bun on her neck. A glass of wine, almost empty, sits in front of her, with a half-empty bottle next to it.  She appears sickly or tired and is treating her hangover with more wine.  Her white shirt identifies her as a working-class woman, likely a prostitute.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nArt historian John Varriano highlights the rise of alcohol consumption during the emergence of modernism, and how its depiction changed in 19th century French art. Haussmannization contributed to the rise of café and music culture, which brought foreigners and residents displaced by construction together to mingle, socialize, and drink. The French legislature deregulated the liquor industry in 1880, leading to what historian Matthew Ramsey describes as a \"rapid growth in bars and other outlets\". Champagne production almost doubled from 1850 to 1883, while wine consumption by Parisians tripled.  \"Increased consumption\", writes Varriano, \"led to increased dysfunction\". In terms of the artistic milieu, Jim Drobnick of OCAD University hypothesizes a kind of \"inebriationism\" to describe the use of alcohol for creative purposes that was popularized in the wake of Romanticism.  Drobnick cites Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire as major exponents of intoxication, which both Van Gogh and Lautrec took advantage of when it came to using absinthe in the cabarets.  Aside from this artistic \"methodology\", there were other reasons for drinking.  The general public came to the cafés \"to wash away their unfulfilled hopes and dreams with alcohol\". Varriano notes that Lautrec may have been drawn to drinking and café culture in this way as well to help cope with his disability. John Storm writes that \"Lautrec drank constantly to anesthetize the pain in his legs and in prodigious quantities.\" Valadon may have been attracted to drinking when she had to give up her dream as a trapeze artist for the Cirque Molier after she fell and injured her back at the age of 15.  In the painting, Valadon \"stares vacantly into space ...Her lack of affect is hardly unique for its time, and likenesses like this are common in the café scenes of Manet, Degas and others. This is the face of urban modernity, detached from a world which on the surface appeared so vibrant and fresh.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nToulouse-Lautrec was often criticized for the way he presented his art models. Biographer June Rose accused Lautrec of portraying Valadon as a \"slattern\" in his work, which contributed to the \"tone of disparagement of Valadon the slut\" for a century, often obscuring her later achievements as a woman artist. As late as 1996, writes Rose, experts were still unfairly referring to Valadon as a prostitute, in spite of her many achievements in the world of art since her time as a model. This bias against women in the artworld was not unique to Lautrec but was symptomatic of institutional classism and misogyny in French society as a whole.  Working-class women like Valadon were viewed as sexually available and promiscuous. Along these same lines, Kathryn Schneider of the New Orleans Museum of Art notes how Lautrec's depiction of Suzanne Valadon changed in The Hangover compared to previous paintings after their relationship soured. \"Lautrec's weakening friendship presents itself in Lautrec's painting of her\", writes Schneider, \"where he depicted her chastened and displeased, seated alone bent over a glass of wine. This portrayal differs greatly from Lautrec's 1885 portrait of Valadon entitled Madame Suzanne Valadon, artiste-peintre, where the artist represented Valadon as a confident and chic woman.\"\nOther artists who supported Lautrec were aligned with his aesthetics and sensibilities. The Hangover would serendipitously bring French Impressionist Edgar Degas (1834–1917) into Lautrec's orbit when it caught his attention and vocal admiration. The illustrated magazine Le Courrier français published a drawing of The Hangover in 1889.    Subsequently, Lautrec gifted the drawing to the Dihau family of musicians, including Désiré Dihau, Henri Dihau, and Marie Dihau.  The Dihau family collected paintings and maintained their own gallery at home and were friends with Degas, although Lautrec had never made his acquaintance up to this point.  One day, Degas was visiting the Dihau home and noticed the drawing of The Hangover, featuring Valadon as the model, hanging on the wall. \"To think,\" Degas remarked, \"a young man has done this, when we have worked so hard all our lives!\" Later, Lautrec recommended Valadon to Degas as a potential mentor. Contrary to rumors, she never posed for Degas. They became good friends, and Degas is said to have helped her exhibit her work in 1894.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe painting is thought to have been originally held by Aristide Bruant, but the provenance is unclear. It was later acquired by Maurice Masson in Paris and sold in 1911 to New York art dealer Stephan Bourgeois, thought to be representing Illiinois native and Canadian railway tycoon William Cornelius Van Horne.  It was held by his descendants until 1946, when it was sold to art collector Maurice Wertheim for $30,000 at an auction of the Van Horne collection.  Upon his death, Wertheim bequested the work to the Fogg Museum in 1951. The painting underwent a full technical examination in 1985, including pigment analysis and an X-radiograph.\n\n\n== Related work ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Hangover (Suzanne Valadon) at the Fogg Museum.",

        "content": "Acteon scrobiculatus is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Acteonidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of the shell attains 12 mm, its diameter 6 mm.\n(Original description) The shell is oblong, ovate and solid. The protoconch is acute and smooth only at the extreme summit. The shell contains seven whorls, cancellate with very distinct spiral lirae, much finer longitudinal striae. The  interstices are rounded or punctate. The lirae on the body whorl are broad and subdivided by a fine groove, longitudinal striae subdistant (so that the interstices are transversely oblong) and passing occasionally over the lirae, so as to make them subgranular, especially at the anterior margin. The aperture is subauriform and posteriorly acutely attenuate. The peristome is anteriorly everted and recurved. The plait is conspicuous, solid and obtuse.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFossils of this marine species have been found in Eocene strata in Tasmania, Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCossmann (M.), 1897 The Gasteropods of the older tertiary of Australia.

The shell contains seven round-shouldered whorls, parted by channelled sutures. The surface is smooth and glossy. The colour of the shell is a pale flesh-pink, darkest behind the aperture, interrupted by a broad white peripheral band.\nSculpture: narrow, shallow punctate grooves numbering about thirty on the body whorl, and on the two previous six each, crowded at the base and wider spaced towards the suture, separate smooth flat-topped narrow spiral riblets. The base of the shell is perforate excavate around the umbilicus. The aperture measures half the total length of the shell and is rounded below. The columella is broad with a reflected margin. Its plication is not prominent. The inner lip spreads a sheet of callus on the base of the previous whorl. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off New South Wales.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIredale, T. & McMichael, D.F. 1962.

It is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide at 350 °C and 300 bar or molten sodium hydroxide at 350 °C to convert it to sodium phenoxide, which yields phenol upon acidification.\nWhen 1-[14C]-1-chlorobenzene was subjected to aqueous NaOH at 395 °C, ipso substitution product 1-[14C]-phenol was formed in 54% yield, while cine substitution product 2-[14C]-phenol was formed in 43% yield, indicating that an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism is predominant, with perhaps a small amount of product from addition-elimination (SNAr).\n\n\n== References ==",

It also included her hit singles, \"(You're) In the Pocket\" and \"You and Me Just Started\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAs of early 1982, the album was in an uncompleted state. According to the February 8, 1982 issue of Record Business, Linda Taylor's album was unfinished. Chris Palmer of Groove Productions had come back to the UK from Midem. He had arranged world-wide licensing deals for her album Taylor Made. According to the magazine, recording was supposed to due for completion that week. A UK release was scheduled for 1st of April.\nThe album had the distinction of being the first of Groove Production's albums to come through the label's new distributor PRT after they had dropped their former distributor, Pinnacle. \nIt was released on Groove Production GPLP31. The songs on the album were, side A; \"You and Me Just Started\", \"Sweet Fever\", \"Walking in the Sun\" and \"Don't Lose the Motion\". Side B; \"Do You Know What I Am\", \"Let Me Into Your Heart\" and \"(You're) In the Pocket\". She was backed by Chris Palmer on bass and synthesizer, John McKenzie on bass, Jeff Dunne, Martin David, Pete Baron and Tony Beard on drums, Danny Schogger on electric piano, acoustic piano and syntheszer, John self on harmonica, Derek Lewis on percussion, Max Middleton on acoustic piano, Chris Hunter and Mel Collins on saxophones, Annie Whitehead on trombone, Guy Barker, Martin Drover and Steve Sidwell on trumpets. Backing vocals were provided by Taylor,  Chrissie Dixon, Nick Curtis, Ray Shell, Sheila Worrall and Tessa Webb.\nThe track \"(You're) In the Pocket\" was an earlier hit, having charted in late 1981.\nThe single from the album, \"You and Me Just Started\" charted in the UK, making it to no. 8 on the Record Business Disco Top 50 chart, and to no. 5 on the Record Business Twelve Inchers chart. It was also a hit in the United States getting top no. 13 on the Billboard Dance / Disco Top 80 chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the Disco Dealer column of the May 10, 1982 issue of Record Business, the Chris Palmber production was one of the three potential monsters noted. It was referred to as an excellent debut set.\nJames Hamilton said the standout on the album was \"Walking in the Sun\". He referred to it as \"superb gut-wrenching deep, deep soul\". He also said \"nothing else can approach the dance appeal of \"You and Me Just Started\" but also said that \"Don't Lose the Motion\" tries.\n\n\n== Charts ==\nFor the week of 17 May 1982, her album Taylor Made made its debut at no. 7 in the Record Business Disco Bestsellers albums chart. It peaked at no. 6 on the week of May 31, and held that position for another week. It was at no. 15 on the week of June 21 then dropped off the following week.

        "content": "The 2024 Boston University strike is an ongoing labor strike in Boston, Massachusetts by graduate student and residential life workers at Boston University. The strike began on March 25, 2024, and was organized by the Boston University Graduate Workers Union (BUGWU) labor union, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union Local 509. It is the longest strike the university has experienced since a 1979 strike which lasted two weeks and four days. A second concurrent strike by the Boston University Residence Life Union (BU ResLife Union) labor union, also affiliated with SEIU 509, ran for four days starting on April 12, 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1979, Boston University experienced a strike as a result of backlash over policies by the university's president John Silber. The union behind this strike, the Boston University - American Association of University Professors, found itself decertified following a ruling NLRB v. Yeshiva University stating that university professors were not protected under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The university did not see another major strike until 45 years later following a 2016 National Labor Relations Board decision that allowed students to unionize.\n\n\n== Boston University Graduate Workers Union ==\nThe university's graduate workers began organizing efforts in late 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to implement a safer workplace. Graduate workers then voted to affiliate with Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 509 in mid-2021, which also represents adjunct professors, lecturers, and residential advisors. In September 2022, graduate workers began a successful public campaign of union authorization forms, advocating for improvements in wages, workload protections, healthcare and coverage, support for international students, and housing. In December 2022, BU's graduate workers voted 1,414 to 28 in favor of unionization, officially forming the Boston University Graduate Workers Union (BUGWU).\n\n\n=== Contract negotiations ===\nBUGWU sought negotiations with Boston University's negotiation team starting in July 2023, holding at least one session a month. The first meeting saw two articles proposed, with the total number since expanding to 40, of which three have been rejected and seven have been tentatively agreed upon as of April 2024.\nDisagreements in pay, healthcare, and benefits prompted BUGWU to move towards voting to authorize a strike. The union moved towards a strike by citing the MIT living wage calculator's estimation of $62,000 a year to live in Boston as being significantly above their pay of $27,000-$40,000 a year. BUGWU also cited greater access to healthcare for workers and their dependents. They highlighted freedom from rent burden, 12-month stipends, disability and public health protections, and parent and caregiver protections. BUGWU held a strike authorization vote from February 28 to March 11, 2024, with 90% voting in favor. They also filed an Unfair Labor Practice with the NLRB against the university, totaling six as of April 2024.\n\n\n== Boston University Residence Life Union ==\nResident assistants (RAs) began organizing in early 2023 after calls for the formation of a labor union in 2021. After holding a rally in support of the BU ResLife union in February 2023, it was announced that a majority of the 280 RAs had signed union authorization forms; a month later, 92% of the RAs voted to form a union and join SEIU Local 509. This union, composed of both undergraduate and graduate students, advocated for a $15 an hour wage, meal plans for non-dormitory workers instead of a $15 per week stipend, improved CPR and Narcan training, crisis intervention, mental health care, summer safety measures, and backpay.\n\n\n=== Contract negotiations ===\nThe BU ResLife Union began contact negotiations with Boston University in December 2023, proposing 28 articles, with five having been tentatively agreed upon as of April 2024. The BU ResLife Union threatened to strike if their demands were not met by the university, holding a strike authorization vote between April 2nd and April 11th. After the strike authorization vote passed and bargaining was unsuccessful, the union began a four day strike, from April 12 to 15. The union stated that they would not fulfill ResLife responsibilities during the strike, such as being on-call or holding conflict mediation. The strike coincided with the 2024 Boston Marathon, a school holiday that sees many parties held.\n\n\n== Strike ==\nOn March 25 at noon, BUGWU began their strike with a rally at Marsh Plaza, the center of the school's campus. This included speeches by graduate workers, Representative Ayanna Pressley, whose district includes the university, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who represents Massachusetts. BUGWU stated that they would continue to picket on weekdays at both the Charles River and Medical campuses until their demands were met.\n18 days later, the BU ResLife Union also began their strike with a rally at Marsh Plaza. ResLife, BUGWU, and other student unions joined in solidarity with their strike as it moved to Warren Towers, the largest dormitory on the university's campus.\n\n\n=== Support ===\nVarious people and groups have shared their support for BUGWU, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, SAG-AFTRA, Boston City Council, State Representative Mike Connolly, the university's student government, and other graduate and teacher unions. The university's student government would also pass a resolution in support of the ResLife strike.\n\n\n== University Reaction ==\nBoston University's Office of the Provost updated their payroll policy as a result of the strike, withholding pay from striking employees. The university sent surveys to graduate workers who received stipends, which BUGWU urged their workers not to fill out without speaking to union representatives. In response, BUGWU filed an Unfair Labor Practice with the NLRB against the university, alleging wage theft. \nDuring the ResLife strike, the university stated that they would continue to allow workers to access their rooms and dining plans, not charging them a daily rate. The university also stated that professional ResLife staff would fill in during strike.\n\n\n=== Artificial Intelligence ===\nOn March 28, 2024, the dean of the Boston University College of Arts and Sciences sent an email to staff and faculty suggesting the use of generative artificial intelligence to give students feedback on assignments in the absence of graduate workers. Multiple news organizations reported on the dean's suggestion, sparking backlash from both students and professors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStudent protest\n1979 Boston University strike\nGraduate student employee unionization\n\n\n== References ==",

Between 1988 and 2011, one winner each was chosen from both the college and University Divisions. The Academic All-America program recognizes combined athletic and academic excellence of the nation's top student-athletes. The University Division team included eligible participants from National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I member schools, while the College Division team included scholar-athletes from all of the following: NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).\nBeginning in 2012, CSC revamped its award structure. The University Division was renamed \"Division I\". Since then, NCAA Divisions II and III have had their own separate All-Americans. The College Division consisted only of non-NCAA institutions through the 2017–18 school year, after which it was effectively replaced by an NAIA division restricted to members of that governing body.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Two-division era (1988–2011) ===\n\n\n=== Four-division era (2012–present) ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nall-time list",

        "content": "No Pants Today is the fourth episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 26 November 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter taking a shower, Stimpy realizes he is naked and feels embarrassed. Ren tells Stimpy he is an idiot as cats did not wear clothing and kicks him out. Stimpy meets the perpetually clueless couple, Mr. and Mrs. Pipe. Mrs. Pipe screams in horror at seeing an undressed cat while Mr. Pipe washes Stimpy away with his hose. Victor and his father, characters first introduced in A Visit to Anthony return to sell Stimpy underwear. Stimpy is kidnapped by Victor and his father who drop him off in a forest. Stimpy is robbed of his underwear by a cow. Stimpy meets a bear who gives him a squirrel to wear as a leotard. Stimpy returns home where Ren scoffs that his story is absurd as cats do not wear pants. Stimpy is revealed to be a transvestite who loves to wear women's dresses and heads down to the local dress shop.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nMrs. Pipe-voice of Cheryl Chase\nMr. Pipe-voice of Billy West\nBear-voice of Bob Camp\nVictor-voice of Danny Cooksey\nVictor's dad-voice of Charlie Callas\nCow-voice of Michael Pataki\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe story was written at the Spümcø studio by Richard Pursel and John Kricfalusi in 1992 who intended it for the second season under the title \"Stimpy That Dirty Little Naked Boy\". When the Spümcø lost the contract for The Ren & Stimpy Show, the story was assigned to the Games Animation studio. As Games Animation struggled to finish off the second season, the story for No Pants Today was held off for the third season. Pursel insisted that the original story that he envisioned was not as violent as the final version, which he blamed on Bill Wray. Pursel recalled: \"I just remember a lot of Bill's suggestions in writing meetings were, 'and then we break his neck! And then they can get him killed!' But he laughed after he said it\". The story was censored by the Nickeldeon network which removed the scene of Stimpy being dragged down a road by a car and Stimpy being tortured with a butter knife as too extreme.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski wrote that the idea for No Pants Today was \"excellent\", but the execution was \"awkward\". Komorowski wrote \"an unpleasant emphasis on pain, rather than Stimpy's humiliation or stupidity, makes \"No Pants Today\" incapable of fully embracing its ironic theme\".\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

He received his education at Dragon School, Sherborne School and the University of Oxford, where he gained two rugby blues. Due to his Welsh birth, Rittson-Thomas was eligible to represent Wales, while as an English domiciled player could also compete for England.\nA wing-forward, Rittson-Thomas won three England caps during the 1951 Five Nations, playing in losses to Wales, Ireland and France, the last of which caused in part by an injury he suffered that left England a man short.\nRittson-Thomas was married in 1951 to Silvia Catriona Fleming, daughter of Olympic rower Philip Fleming.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of England national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChris Rittson-Thomas at ESPNscrum\nChris Rittson-Thomas at England Rugby",

Lenses marketed as all-in-one usually cover a wide-angle to telephoto range beyond that of standard zoom lenses. There is significant overlap between the two categories with a few exceptions. For example, the Sigma 60-600mm F4.5-6.3 is considered a superzoom lens but not an all-in-one lens. Conversely, the Tamron 35-150mm F2-2.8 is considered an all-in-one lens but not a superzoom lens.\n\n\n== Full-frame superzoom lenses ==\nThis is a list of lenses designed for full-frame mirrorless cameras that have an optical zoom ratio greater than 7×.\n\n\n== APS-C superzoom lenses ==\nThis is a list of lenses designed for APS-C mirrorless cameras that have an optical zoom ratio greater than 7×. For comparison, the longest superzoom lens designed for DSLRs was the Tamron 18-400mm F3.5-6.3 for EF and F mounts, which had a 22× optical zoom ratio.\n\n\n== Micro Four Thirds superzoom lenses ==\nThis is a list of Micro Four Thirds lenses that have an optical zoom ratio greater than 7×.\n\n\n== Nikon 1 superzoom lenses ==\nThis is a list of Nikon 1 lenses that have an optical zoom ratio greater than 7×.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of standard zoom lenses\nList of superzoom compact cameras\nList of bridge cameras\nList of kit lenses\nList of pancake lenses\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cirucus Midgets is the third episode  of the third season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 26 November 1993.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRen and Stimpy are hitchhiking across a desert somewhere in the American Southwest when they are picked up by two diabolically cruel circus midgets dressed as clowns, Shlomo and Momo, who sound like Joe Pesci in the 1990 film Goodfellas. The two midgets play a number of vicious practical jokes on Ren and Stimpy. Shlomo and Momo rob a gas station and take hostages. The car clashes during a police chase and the hostages escape. Ren and Stimpy resume hitchhiking, this time dressed as a clowns, and are picked up by the Fire Chief.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nFire Chief-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe script for Circus Midgets was written by Peter Avanzino and was heavy with references to the 1990 film Goodfellas, which Avanzino was a fan of. Jim Gomez was assigned to direct Circus Midgets, a story that he did not want to direct as he felt that script for Circus Midgets was too violent and too full of references to Goodfellas.. Gomez was told to direct Circus Midgets if he wanted to be a director. Gomez said of Circus Midgets: \"I absolutely did not want to do it. I hated all the referential shit. Ballantine said, 'well there's not going to be any more opportunities for you directing if you don't do this one first. Their whole thinking was that this script had already been approved. I just wanted to throw it out, but there was a bunch of bullshit attached to the delivery requirements at the time that we weren't privy to, and that seemed to be the driving force for a lot of it\". Gomez was clearly unenthusiastic about the story that he directed, which impacted on the finished product..\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American journalist Thad Komorowski gave Circus Midgets one star out of five.. Komorowski wrote that Circus Midgets was as \"mean-spirted\" as it was unfunny. Komorowski stated that basic problem with Circus Midgets was Ren and Stimpy were \"merely punching bags for a domineering third party\" with Ren and Stimpy merely reacting instead of acting as been the case with the two cartoons from 1992 with George Liquor as the villain. The show's producer, Vanessa Coffey admitted that the episode was a failure, saying: \"It probably crossed some violent lines that we won't want to do again. We probably won't be using those circus midget characters in future episodes either\".    \n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015).

In his early years, he trained regiment defense in his hometown. When the Japanese army invaded China, Zhang Ti'an, his wife Zhao Lanhua, and others formed a guerrilla army, dealt with the Japanese army, and successfully contained the Japanese army. Later, the division was reorganized into the Ninth Division, where he served as general and division commander. A graduate of Whampoa Military Academy, he participated in the Battle of Tangyin. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, he fled to Taiwan. Because he was an upright official, he ran the \"True Peiping Restaurant\" on Zhonghua Road, Taipei City, to make a living. In 1966, he co-founded Minghsin University of Science and Technology with four party-state elders, Wang Zongshan, Hao Lixu, Li Hongchao and Zhang Fengxi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1218244744,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Kitano Ken (北野謙) (1968 - ) is a Japanese photographer who graduated from Nihon University's College of Industrial Technology. Kitano has held solo exhibitions and participated in various group exhibitions domestically in Japan and internationally in countries such as Belgium, China, France, Germany, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United States. In 2004, he won the Society of Photography Award, and in 2007, he won the Newcomer's Award from the Photographic Society of Japan. He was an artist-in-residence at the Three Shadows Photography Art Centre in Beijing, China, in 2010. In 2012, he spent one year in Los Angeles, California, on the Overseas Study Program for Emerging Artists which was overseen by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs.\nKitano has also published numerous photography books, such as our face: Asia and FLOW AND FUSION. He has also collaborated on other books such as Witness #2, with Moriyama Daido, and Photography? End? Seven Visions – New Photographic Experiences.\n\n\n== Flow and Fusion ==\nThis was Kitano's first project, a series of cityscapes taken predominantly throughout Tokyo near the end of the Japanese economic boom, which ended around 1992. Kitano utilized a slow shutter technique, which captures the movement of people or vehicles in a dematerialized and amorphous cloud-like entity. He was fascinated by the dematerialization of the human subjects that appeared as clouds in his images and felt he was “analyzing the world on a molecular level.” Katsuya Ishida, gallery director of MEM in Tokyo, explains that the dematerialization captured through the clouds of human movement latent with the energy and dynamism of the roaring Japanese economy made Kitano feel connected “with everyone in the universe as a whole.” \nIshida explains that after the end of the Japanese economic miracle in 1991, Japan was beset by several disasters compounded by economic stagnation. After the Great Hanshin Earthquake and the sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway, Kitano lost his artistic initiative and stopped producing works. During this time, Kitano traveled several times to Mexico, where he was exposed to the large-scale mural paintings by artists such as Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco that depicted a multitude of people which Kitano lists “figures from the pre-Columbian era, invaders, rapists, living sacrifices, despots, resistance fighters, children, clergymen, prostitutes, con-artists, merchants, farmers,… coexisting in one image.” These murals inspired him to take portraits, which he then superimposed on top of one another to create composite portraits of people from “different races, countries, classes, occupations and religions around the world.” Ishida says that the throughline between the Flow and Fusion series and his later Our Face series is the blurring of individuality, which finds itself as “part of the larger entity of the passage of time” in which he “(explores) the state of human existence in relation to individuality.” \n\n\n== Our Face ==\nKitano traveled to various locations throughout Asia and photographed people in different localities, such as Istanbul, Turkey; Xinjiang, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Mae Hong Son, Thailand; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Kermanshah, Iran. He then developed those portraits from specific localities into a single image.\nPhotography Critic, Yu Hidaka, uses the concept of Mille Plateau, a thousand plateaus, to describe the Our Face series. The thousand plateaus are “formed by the continuous configuration of… differences with no single apex or hierarchy,” and the concept was developed by the American anthropologist Gregory Bateson. In each image of the Our Face series, individuals, or differences, are superimposed with equal exposure time onto a single image or a Mille Plateau. Hidaka argues that these composite images function to flatten or loosen relationships, such as those between religion, gender, and socio-economic statuses.\nWhile photographic portraits have often been used as representations of the individuality of subjectivity, Ayelet Zohar explains that Japanese photographers such as Ken Kitano, Tomoko Sawada, Yasumasa Morimura, and Cozue Takagi have utilized the photographic portrait to address issues of \"fictionality and performativity… using strategies of mimicry, masquerade, camouflage, disguise, multiplicity, juxtaposition, and repetition.\" She states that Kitano's Our Face series addresses issues of \"layering and memory,\" where through the superimposition of portraits of people, the works arrive \"at the erasure of individual identity.\" For Zohar, Kitano's singular images conceal individuals \"under the mask of a unified portrait, where hidden layers stay secretive, like the layers of an archeological site, or of the unconscious.\" These metaphors of archeology and the unconscious allow Zohar to analyze Kitano's work in the context of Derrida's analysis of Freud's writing \"mystic writing pad,\" which \"preserves traces of past occurrences.\" Derrida goes one step further than Freud's concept and argues that systems of language and images contain \"traces… that pre-figure language, meaning, and signification.\" Kitano's Our Face series engages in Derrida's investigation of the concept of \"trace.\" By layering the individuality of his subjects, Kitano grasps at the traces of a deeper history tahat pre-figures any individual subjective identities that his subjects may have.\nZohar also compares Kitano's work to the 19th-century genetic research of Sir Francis Galton, who tried to develop a system for categorizing ethnicity through facial features. She mentions that Nancy Burson created similar layered portraits that used computer imaging in the 1980s that were critical of 19th century notions of eugenics proposed by researchers like Galton but Zohar argues that Kitano's work is not subversive like Burson's. In Zohar's analysis Kitano's works exist between these Galton's classification and Burson's criticism, as \"evidence of the crowd we have become, and the lost value of the personal portrait in the world flooded by endless visual information.\"\n\n\n== Long Exposure ==\nKitano's One Day series are long exposure photographs that capture the trajectory of the sun over one day; the resulting images are landscapes and cityscapes with a streak of white going through the sky. Kitano invokes collective memory in his deliberate choice of locations in places like “ground zeroes of bomb blasts, islands of convalescence for leprosy patients, and old battlegrounds in Okinawa.” In an essay for the series, Kitano compared his project to Monet's endeavor to capture the changing light of the Rouen Cathedral.\nWhile Kitano's One Day series tracks the movement of the sun over the course of a single day, Kitano's Gathering Light series captures the movement of the sun through long exposure over the course of six months. The streaks of light in the works are captured by a camera that is left in various locations for six months. The resulting images are landscapes and cityscapes with zebra-like stripes across the sky where the sun's movements have been recorded over time. The angle of the streaks of light, which are records of the sun's movement across the sky, in the photographs indicate the latitude and longitude of the position of the camera. Because the camera is left over the course of six months, the sun is obstructed by rain clouds, so the resulting image is also a sort of meteorological record.\n\n\n== Permanent Collections ==\nKitano's works are included in various public collections such as the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo; Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art; Tokyo Photographic Art Museum; The National Museum of Art, Osaka; and The Museum of Modern Art Saitama; J. Paul Getty Museum; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"You and Me Just Started\" is a 1982 single by English singer Linda Taylor. It became a hit for her in the UK that year as well as in the US.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAn ad appeared in the 3 May 1982 issue of UK music trade magazine Record Business informing readers that Linda Taylor's new single from her album Taylor Made, \"You and Me Just Started\" was a hit and it was available in 7\" format on GP 317 and 12: format on GP 3112. It was available through PRT Distribution or Groove Production.\nBrian Chin mentioned in his Dance Trax column for Billboard that the Prelude record label had a successful import run with the UK label Groove and would release \"You and Me Just Started\" in the US.\nIt is on the RVA Mag 039: Body Talk playlist.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn his January 30, 1982  Odds ‘N’ Bods column, James Hamilton gave a brief review of Linda Taylor's album which was still in the early stages, and in what he described by as an incomplete rough mix, he said that every cut was dripping with class and the ultimate killer was likely to be \"You and Me Just Started\". On the week of April 24, Hamilton mentioned the single again in his column, calling Cris Palmer's production an \"excellent chunkily bumping 114bpm 12in staccato lurcher full of great little twiddly bits\". He also mentioned the influence from Chic's song \"Good Times\" and that DJs could craftily mix Chic in the break near the end of the song.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== UK ===\nFor the week of April 26, 1982 \"You and Me Just Started\" made its debut in the Record Business Disco Bubbling Under chart at no. 56.

It also peaked at no. 5 in the Twelve Inchers chart that week, with the last entry in that chart at no. 9 on the week of June 14. It spent a total of eleven weeks in the Disco Top 50.\n\n\n=== US ===\nFor the week ending 19 June 1982, her single \"You and Me Just Started\" made its debut in the Billboard Dance / Disco Top 80 chart at no. 52.

        "content": "Terence 'Terry' Phillip O'Brien (12 January 1937 – 4 July 2016) was an Australian botanist who was an expert in the development of wheat, and who was an early pioneer of Australian eco-tourism.\n\n\n== Life ==\nO'Brien completed a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Science and a Master of Science from the University of Melbourne in 1962. He studied at Harvard University, and was the first Australian appointed to the Harvard Society of Fellows as a junior fellow between 1964 and 1967, and completed a PhD.\nAfter returning to Australia was employed as a senior lecturer at Monash University between 1967 and 1970. In 1970 he was appointed as a Reader in Botany at the same university, and established an electron microscope at the University, and the Plant Cell Biology Laboratory. He received a Doctor of Science from Monash University in 1978, for his contributions to understanding the physiological anatomy of plant cells and tissues. From July 1986 to June 1987, O'Brien was elected president of the Royal Society of Victoria. He also was a chartered biologist of the Royal Society of Biology, and a member of the Australian Institute of Biology.\nAfter assisting the university to introduce Australia's first postgraduate degree in tourism studies in 1989, O'Brien resigned from Monash University to found an eco-tourism company himself. He eventually moved back to his alma mater of Harvard University before retiring.\n\n\n== Botanical legacy ==\nO'Brien specialised in the study of the development and structure of wheat, and plant morphology more broadly. Publications he contributed to include:\n\nTP O'Brien and ME McCully. 1969. Plant structure and development: a pictorial and physiological approach. (New York: Macmillan.)\nSY Zee and TP O'Brien. 1970. \"A Special Type of Tracheary Element Associated with \"Xylem Discontinuity\" in the Floral Axis of Wheat.\" Australian Journal of Biological Sciences 23(4) 783 - 792.\nJG Swift and TP O'Brien. 1970. \"Vascularization of the scutellum of wheat.\" Australian Journal of Botany 18(1) 45 - 53.\nJG Swift and TP O'Brien. 1971. \"Vascular differentiation in the wheat embryo.\" Australian Journal of Botany 19(1) 63 - 71.\nTP O'Brien, RL Clark, and PF Lumley. 1972. Manual of techniques in plant histology. (Clayton, Vic.: Monash University. Botany Department.)\nTP O'Brien and J Kuo. 1975. \"Development of the Suberized Lamella in the Mestome Sheath of Wheat Leaves.\" Australian Journal of Botany 23(5) 783 - 794.\nS Craig and TP O'Brien. 1975. \"The Lodicules of Wheat: Pre- and Post-Anthesis.\" Australian Journal of Botany 23(3) 451 - 458.\nCH Busby and TP O'Brien. 1979. \"Aspects of Vascular Anatomy and Differentiation of Vascular Tissues and Transfer Cells in Vegetative Nodes of Wheat.\" Australian Journal of Botany 27(6) 703 - 711.\nTP O'Brien and ME McCully. 1981. The study of plant structure: principles and selected methods. (Melbourne: Termarcarphi.)\nTP O'Brien. 1986. Plants, insects and fire in the Big Desert. [videorecording]. (Clayton, Vic.: Educational Technology Section, Monash University.)\nSpecimens collected by O'Brien during his career at Monash University are now cared for by the National Herbarium of Victoria, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was founded in 2010 and is owned by Sunnyside Restaurant Group.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first restaurant was opened on July 12, 2010, by Spike Mendelsohn. It was located on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., next to Mendelsohn's Good Stuff Eatery. The Greek taverna that was located there wanted to leave, and Mendelsohn wanted to have both of his restaurants next to each other. He did not have an idea for what we was going to do with the area when he signed the lease, but eventually settled on pizza. This took a while, and they were paying rent on the location for around a year before it officially opened. After it opened, Barack and Michelle Obama frequented the restaurant. Mendelsohn's family also had formed Sunnyside Restaurant Group, which operates the chain and five other franchises internationally.\nIts second location was opened in June 2014, in Crystal City, Arlington. The Ballston, Arlington, restaurant opened in October 2019. In 2021, We, the Pizza partnered with Michael Waltz and Vicky Hartzler to donate pizzas to the National Guard in appreciation of their services.\n\n\n== Menu ==\nThe chain has 17 custom pre-made pizza designs. They also offer cinnamon and garlic knots, buffalo wings, and salads.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nWe, the Pizza has five locations, four of which in the Arlington-Washington, D.C. area. There are two in Arlington, in Ballston and Crystal City, and two in Washington, D.C., in Capitol Hill and U Street. The remaining restauant is in Clearwater, Florida.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "\"Emerald Archer\" is the twelfth episode of the seventh season and 150th overall of the American television series Arrow, based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, revolving around billionaire playboy Oliver Queen as he returns to Star City, after having been shipwrecked for five years, and becomes a bow-wielding, hooded vigilante who sets out to fight crime and corruption. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe. The episode was written by Marc Guggenheim and Emilio Aldrich and directed by Glen Winter.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOliver allows a camera crew to follow himself and others associated with Team Arrow around and film a documentary titled The Hood and the Rise of Vigilantes. A new vigilante, named Chimera by Curtis, begins attacking vigilantes in Star City, including Ragman, Huntress, and the new Green Arrow. William returns from witness protection and tells Felicity he was expelled from school, while Oliver debates Mayor Pollard about vigilantism but is interrupted by Chimera. During the attack, Dinah saves Pollard using her Canary Cry, revealing her identity as the Black Canary. When Team Arrow arrives and helps Oliver capture Chimera, Pollard arrests them, prompting Oliver and Dinah to turn themselves in and resulting in Pollard deputizing Team Arrow as part of the SCPD.\nIn 2040, it is shown that Blackstar is watching the documentary on Oliver. With intel gained from the documentary, Blackstar and Connor Hawke find the abandoned Team Arrow bunker.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\"Emerald Archer\" was written by Marc Guggenheim and Emilio Aldrich and directed by Glen Winter. The episode is presented as a mockumentary. The episode features several nods to various people involved with both the Green Arrow comics and series including Beth Schwartz, Kevin Smith, and David Nutter.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe episodes stars Stephen Amell, David Ramsey, Emily Bett Rickards, Colton Haynes, Kirk Acevedo, Echo Kellum, Juliana Harkavy, Sea Shimooka, Katie Cassidy Rodgers as Oliver Queen, John Diggle, Felicity Smoak, Roy Harper, Ricardo Diaz, Curtis Holt, Rene Ramirez, Dinah Drake, as Emiko Adachi, and Laurel Lance. Kelsey Grammer guest stars as the narrator of the documentary.\nThe episode features several returning characters from the series including former series regulars Paul Blackthorne and Willa Holland as Quentin Lance and Thea Queen respectively. Caity Lotz returns as Sara Lance as does Bex Taylor-Klaus as Sin.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Emerald Archer\" was met with praise from critics. IGN's Jesse Scheeden described the episode as \"fun\" and \"memorable\" rating it a 9.1/10. Scheenden felt that the episode \"hit all the right emotional notes.\" The A.V. Club's Allision Shoemaker was far more negative rating the episode a C-. She felt that the episode was disappointing and unfunny.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEmerald Archer at IMDb",

        "content": "Alfonso Soriano Benítez de Lugo (born October 2, 1936) is a Spanish jurist, civil servant, and politician, five times a member of Congress, as well as a senator and first president of the pre-autonomous entity Junta de Canarias.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe graduated in law from the University of Madrid, and after studying at the University of La Laguna, he expanded and completed studies at the School of Industrial Organization (EOI) and at the current National Institute of Public Administration, where he later became a professor. He entered public service by opposition within the technical body of the State Civil Administration in the 1960s. He held various responsibilities as a public official during the Franco dictatorship, where he was deputy director general in the personnel area of two ministries: education and housing and the Presidency of the Government.\nIn the political sphere, during the Transition, he joined the Democratic Center Union (UCD), a formation with which he was elected deputy in 1977 for the Tenerife constituency in the first free elections after the dictatorship, participating in the constituent process. In the next electoral call in 1979, he was elected senator, also for Tenerife. He was part of the Assembly of Parliamentarians that addressed the implementation of the autonomous process for the Canary Islands and began the preparation of what would later become the autonomous statute of the islands. In this process, Alfonso Soriano was the first president of the pre-autonomous governing body, the Junta de Canarias, between 1978 and 1979. He was replaced in office by his UCD colleague, Fernando Bergasa Perdomo.\nAfter the disintegration of UCD following the party's severe defeat in the 1982 elections, Alfonso Soriano joined the Popular Party, a party with which he was again elected deputy to Congress in 1989, 1993, 1996, and 2000.\nAfter leaving Congress in 2004, he was a councilor of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife City Council until 2011, being critical of his political formation, both in relation to the city government and in the management of the Tenerife leadership itself. The Tenerife City Council awarded him distinctions and honors in 2012 for his work as the first president of the Canary Islands.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAlfonso Soriano Benítez de Lugo (Q15623422)",

Currently he is the Eleanor and Jahangir Amuzegar Professor of Iranian, the founding Director of the Pourdavoud Center for the Study of the Iranian World, and the Head of the Department of Iranian Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (from 2014). He also is a foreign corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2022), a member of the Academia Europaea (2019) and the American Oriental Society and a Guggenheim fellow (2013, for writing the book Arsacids and Sasanians: Political Ideology in Post-Hellenistic and Late Antique Persia).\nSon of Dariush Shayegan, Rahim Shayegan received his B.A. from the University of Cologne, Germany, and his M.A. from the University of Sorbonne, followed by Ph.D. work at the University of Göttingen and received his Ph.D. in the Harvard University like a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows.\nShayegan focused of his research in the Iranian philology and epigraphy, religion and the history of ancient Iran, primarily the history of Achaemenid, Arsacid, Seleucid, and Sasanian periods.\nShaegan most quoted and authoritative book Arsacids and Sasanians: Political Ideology in Post-Hellenistic and Late Antique Persia was to be translated into Persian, but the intended translator died shortly after starting the work. It is a study of the relations of the Iranian empires with Western states and speculation as to whether the Sassanids were aware of Iran's Parthian past. Arsacids and Sasanians: Political Ideology in Post-Hellenistic and Late Antique Persia received positive reviews from professional iranists. Accorting to Sabine Müller, this book is 'differentiated, thorough, lively, inspiring, and ambitious study'.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nArsacids and Sasanians: Political Ideology in Post-Hellenistic and Late Antique Persia (Illustrated ed.).

        "content": "Theirs is the Glory is a 1945 Australian radio series by James J. Donnelly about the Australian army's campaign in New Guinea in World War Two. It was one of ABC radio's biggest productions of the year.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n1 (October 8) - Yellow Tidal Wave\n2 (October 15) - Green Crucible - \"On March 8, 1942. a handful of New Guinea Volunteer Riflemen accepted the challenge of Japan’s  picked troops in the landings at Lae and Salamaua, on the north coast of New Guinea. Green Crucible, in a set of exclusive actuality recordings, visions the world's most savage jungle through the eyes of a famous battle-front war photographer—the late Damien Parer. It describes in detail the Salamaua Raid one of the first ofiensive blows struck at the Japanese in the South-west Pacific. There are also highlights from the Battle of the Coral Sea\".\n3 (October 22)\n4 (October 29) - The Tide Was Turned - the Battle of Milne Bay.\n5 (November 5) - Boots to the Beach-Heads. \"Tells of the Kokoda Trail and the fighting advance across the ranges. It recalls the imperishable story of the 25th and 3 16th Brigades, veterans of the Middle East, fighting for the homeland at Australia's Northern Gate.  The story is splashed with the scarlet of Templeton’s Crossing, of Oivi-Corari, Soputa, and Journey’s End, a cul-de-sac of fever swamp where the jungle meets the sea.\"\n6 (November 12) Beaver versus Fox. \"When, the Japanese were driven across the mountains of New Guinea  they retired to weapon-pits at the north coast beachheads of Buna, Gona, and Sanananda. At the  jungle edge the battle of the beaches represent d Australian patience and determination pitted against Japanese cunning.\"\n7 (November 19) The Thin Green Line. \"Behind mountain ramparts in the jungle heart of New Guinea lies the fabulous township of Wau. Famous before the war as the centre of one of the richest alluvial goldfields in the world, it is to-day a happy hunting  ground of as select a company of Australia’s warrior sons as ever broke the pride of the arrogant invader. Episode 7 tells of the famous Battle of Wau,  when “the thin green line” was saved by reinforcements flown in under the guns of the Japanese.\"\n8 (November 26)—Bullets and Beans. \"In superstitious Japan they celebrate the New Year with a ceremony known as mami-maki, when invading devils are pelted with dried beans. Around the mountain razorbacks beyond Mubo, avenging Australians played mami-maki with bullets Instead of beans. Episode 8 presents an eye-witness  account of the Bismarck Sea battle and the arrival of  the Americans at Nassau Bay.\"\n9 (3 December) - Mountain Round Up - \"In the sky-reaching mountain masses beyond  Mubo, hard-hitting Australians, with the support of American comrades, staged New Guinea's history-making, Jap-breaking, mountain round-up. Here where the razor backs are capped with clouds—with the 15th Brigade and jungle-hardened commandos taking a will-o’-the-wisp  vengeance on many outposts—the 17th Brigade rounded up and roped the Japanese in the stockade of Salamaua.\"\n10 (10 December) - Sand-Table Saga. \"In the winter of 1943, whilst the 7th and 9th Divisions added  to their repertoire the latest in jungle craft, military experts for the first time in the Pacific War enjoyed the luxury of long-range planning. At planning H.Q.  they translated ideas for the capture of “Bomb-happy” Lae to the visual language of a sand-table saga. Sand-Table Saga brings you a first-hand story of Australian paratroops who, with dismantled 25-pounders, dropped from the sky to capture the Nadzab air-strip, in the Markham Valley.\"\n11 (17 December) - Mural in Scarlet\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abolitionists Rising (formerly known as Free The States) is an American anti-abortion organization based in Oklahoma. It is known for its categorical opposition to abortion and cold contact engagement with pedestrians, college students, and pro-choice or pro-life figures.\n\n\n== Theological position ==\nAbolitionists Rising asserts that its objectives are the \"abolition of abortion, the repentance of the nation, and the glorification of God,\" to disseminate abolitionist ideas and promote abolitionist organizations, projects, and legislation.\nIn regard to the methodology, T. Russell Hunter, the organization's Director of Operations, has stated that Christians ought to be \"build[ing] the kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven the best that [they] can,\" and that \"whether things get worse or things get better, [they] are supposed to be living as though Christ is actually King and is putting His enemies under His feet.\"\nThe organization says that several of its members have joined from the pro-life movement, and organizes conferences that call people to repentance, and have worked with Oklahoma State Senators Dusty Deevers and Joseph Silk. In December 2023, it hosted a debate with Joel Barry, the Managing Editor at The Babylon Bee, who is a pro-life advocate, over the topic of whether women who abort should be prosecuted.\n\n\n== Key principles ==\nBecause Abolitionists Rising views abortion as infanticide, it considers the distinction between different types of abortion (to allow it in cases of incest, rape, etc.) as unjust discrimination against preborn human beings based on family history and circumstance of conception. For this reason, it pursues an immediate end to all abortion, without allowing for exceptions.\nAbolitionists Rising is particular about its distinction from the mainstream pro-life position, which it says makes compromises with the pro-choice movement, and deems the latter to be unacceptable. Likewise, Abolitionists Rising  opposes what it calls \"incrementalism\", and characterizes itself as \"immediatist\". In using the term \"abolitionist\" in its name, Abolitionists Rising also draws a parallel between pro-abortion rhetoric and pro-slavery rhetoric (namely, \"My property, my prerogative\" and \"My body, my choice\").\nThe organization calls attention to the religious motivation of many abolitionists during the Second Great Awakening, and frequently cites historic abolitionist thought as authority, including that of William Wilberforce, William Lloyd Garrison, and Frederick Douglass, especially the belief that humans, from conception onwards, are made in the image of God and thus deserve equal protection under the law of the land. Owing to such convictions, the organization's website states, \"We deny that secular argumentation alone is sufficient to address the sin of abortion because secular reasoning cannot provide a justification for objective truth or human rights.\"\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Online advocacy ===\nAbolitionists Rising promotes laws and policies that advocate for the outlawing of abortion, indiscriminate of circumstance. In part due to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, and in part due to the group's viral videos on social media (such as via YouTube Shorts), the organization gained significant traction in 2023.\n\n\n=== Appeal through art ===\nMuch of the artwork generated by Abolitionists Rising is created by T. Russell Hunter, one of the main debaters who is frequently featured in the organization's social media content. Many of these artworks are put on posters, which are held up at art walks and other public streets to prompt conversation.\nIn many of Abolitionists Rising's videos on social media, passersby can sometimes be seen being agitated or upset by the graphic nature of the images on the organization's posters. However, Hunter often counters that this is a good thing and that provocative art has often been used to drive social change for good.\n\n\n=== Theological engagement ===\nThe Abolitionist Rising debaters go on college campuses to debate with students on abortion, often in conjunction with a host of other theological topics, such as the gospel, typology, religions other than Christianity, sins other than abortion, divine forgiveness, logic, history, and philosophy, as shown in the organization's social media channels. \nOften the debaters also opt for the use of biblical language. For example, they consistently describe abortion as \"child sacrifice,\" drawing a parallel between modern abortion and ancient Israel's infanticidal practices in its worship of Molech. Like the original abolitionists, the group also describes immorality primarily in terms of the category of sin, such as characterizing the practice of chattel slavery as the sin of \"manstealing,\" a word that harkens back to Exodus 21:16.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the controversial topic of abortion, the debaters of Abolitionists Rising often face overt hostility from passersby, including from various members of a local security staff or outspoken opponents, including being told to debate only in the free speech areas or to remove themselves completely from a public area. In 2023, in Wichita, Kansas, a group of Abolitionists Rising members were confronted by a former police officer, who was identified in a video making threats, knocking down a camera, and allegedly injuring one of the debaters.\nThe organization has also been accused of \"[appropriating] anti-slavery messaging and imagery\" by some in the pro-choice demographic and being too extreme by some in the pro-life demographic. In the face of such accusations, Abolitionists Rising members maintain that a national ban on slavery, too, was once perceived as an extreme stance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "A Chinese chef's knife — sometimes referred to as a Càidāo (Chinese: 菜刀, lit. \"vegetable knife\"), a Chinese cleaver or a \"chopper\", is the rectangular-bladed, all-purpose cooking knife traditionally used in China, Vietnam, Cambodia and many other Asian countries to prepare a variety of meats, fish and vegetables.  The popularity of this style of knife has spread with the associated cuisines.  They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, finely chopping and mincing vegetables, fish and boneless meats. The heavier gǔdāo (Chinese: 骨刀, lit. \"bone knife\") are produced and are used much like Western-type meat cleavers to prepare large sides of beef, pork and other boned meats.  However, Chinese-style knives of this weight are not common in the West.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nCaidao or so-called 'Chinese cleaver' is not a cleaver, and most manufacturers warn that it should not be used as a cleaver. It is more properly referred to as a Chinese chef's knife and is actually a general-purpose knife, analogous to the French chef's knife or the Japanese santoku. The confusion arises from the fact that Chinese chef's knives are rectangular and that some (particularly older, traditional knives made of carbon steel) have somewhat heavy blades. Also, the fact that the blade is heavier toward the tip encourages skilled Chinese chefs to use a swinging or \"tapping\" stroke as well as a \"pushing\" stroke. However, the edge has the gradual bevel of a chef's knife and will most probably be damaged if used for splitting bone. Actual cleavers in China have the same profile as chef's knives, but have much thicker blades with a sharp bevel and heavier handles.\nModern Chinese knives are sold under three general classifications throughout China: Caidao (slicers), choppers and Gudao (cleavers). The general distinction lies in the thickness of the blade.  Choppers are the most common all-purpose Chinese knife. Choppers have thicker blades than slicers but are not as thick and heavy as cleavers. Choppers are used for slicing, chopping and mincing meat, vegetables and herbs. Choppers are suitable for chopping through thin soft bones such as fish and poultry.  Slicers, referred to as Caidao (vegetable knives) by the Chinese have the thinnest and sharpest blades. Slicers may have the same shape as choppers or they may have less width and appear similar to Japanese Nakiri knives. Slicers are used for cutting vegetables, mincing herbs and slicing thin strips of meat for stir frying. The thin blade makes slicers unsuitable for chopping any bones. Cleavers, which are referred to as bone choppers by the Chinese have thick heavy blades. In Chinese homes, cleavers are typically used for chopping up pork ribs or for preparing hard-shelled seafood such as lobsters.\nThe average Chinese home uses some variation of the rectangular-bladed knife, usually around 18 cm to 28 cm (7–11 inches) in length. Traditional knives had a simply-forged, carbon steel blade with a long, ground bevel, but the typical Chinese chef's knife is now a stamped blade. The traditional handle is a full-length tang that is only about 1 or 2 cm wide, which is passed through a metal cap, then through the center of a round, wood dowel, then bent over and hammered into the end of the handle to retain it. Newer models, particularly those made in Japan or Germany, have full-width tangs and riveted or injection-molded handles, but these handles generally retain something of the traditional, round cross-section. The wide blade of Caidao keeps the cook's fingers well off the cutting surface and the round handle gives a nice \"pivot point\" for the cutting stroke. The blade has a curvature or rocker along its edge that is generally uniform, improving the knife's ability to chop and mince meats and vegetables. The broad rectangular blade also serves to scoop up chopped food for transport to the wok or bowl. Although it may seem unwieldy, skilled practitioners worldwide may be observed using this style of knife for everything—even carving and fine work normally accomplished with a paring knife.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCleaver\nKitchen knife\nKinmen knife\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tiiu Kirsipuu (born October 29, 1957) is an Estonian sculptor.\n\nKirsipuu's creations range from a coin measuring a few centimeters to a sculpture 8 meters (26 ft) long. Her works employ both realistic and abstract forms, and she uses many materials to realize her ideas. Among her best-known works is the Sculpture of Oscar Wilde and Eduard Vilde in Tartu.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTiiu Kirsipuu was born in Tartu. She attended Miina Härma Primary and Secondary School in Tartu from 1965 to 1975 and Tallinn Secondary School No. 46 from 1975 to 1976. In 1983, she graduated from the Tallinn State Applied Art Institute of the ESSR (now the Estonian National Art Institute), majoring in sculpture.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1983 to 1987, she supervised a sculpture class at the Nõmme Pioneers Palace, from 1987 to 1993 she was a freelance artist, and from 1993 to 2003 she worked as a lecturer at the Estonian Academy of Arts and from 2003 to 2019 as a lecturer at Tallinn University. Since 2019, she has been working as a freelance artist in Tallinn.\nShe has held solo exhibitions in Estonia, Finland, Germany, Holland, France, China, Russia, and Belgium, and she has participated in numerous group exhibitions both in Estonia and abroad. Kirsipuu has taken part in many international sculpture symposiums and competitions, and she has created snow and ice sculptures. She has also designed several commemorative plaques, awards, and memorial sculptures.\nKirsipuu was the organizer of Sagadi International Wood Sculpture Symposium.\nShe has been a member of the Estonian Artists' Association since 1987 and also belongs to the Estonian Sculptors' Association.\nIn 2012, the film Tiiu Kirsipuu. Edu kood (Tiiu Kirsipuu. Code of Success) by Rein Raamat was released.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nKirsipuu's best-known work is the sculpture of Sculpture of Oscar Wilde and Eduard Vilde on Vallikraavi tänav (Moat Street) in Tartu—that is, a statue of the \"two Wildes.\" In this work created in 1999, the bronze figures of the writers Eduard Vilde and Oscar Wilde sit side by side on a bench. A replica of this sculpture has also been made. To mark Estonia's accession to the European Union, Estonia and the city of Tartu donated a copy of the sculpture to the city of Galway in Ireland in 2004.\nShe has created numerous sculptures and memorials displayed in public spaces. Examples include the Kaarnakivi (Raven's Stone) memorial to the writer Juhan Jaik in Rõuge (1999), the monument to the 100th anniversary of the Estonia Theater in Tallinn (2006), the Johan Skytte Monument on Toomemägi in Tartu (2006), and the sculpture of a seated musician at the Vanemuine Concert Hall in Tartu (2009). She also created the sculpture Igavene Üliõpilane Juulius (The Eternal Student Juulius, 2008) located at the Tallinn University of Technology, the Stone Bridge Model (2003) located near the Arch Bridge in Tartu, the sculpture Tüdruk linnuga (Girl with a Bird) located in the University of Tartu Botanical Garden (1987; originally in front of the Tartu Student Club), and the Ants Sööt Monument (2015) in Elva.\nKirsipuu has designed several coins commissioned by the Bank of Estonia. These are an EEK 15.65 gold commemorative coin (1999), a silver commemorative coin for the anniversary of the University of Tartu (2001), a silver commemorative coin for the 100th anniversary of the Estonia Theater (2006), and a silver coin dedicated to the 2008 Summer Olympics (2008).\nShe created a bronze bust of the poet Robert Burns that stands in the Kirsipuu Garden of the Scottish Club (Estonian: Šoti klubi) in Tallinn's Old Town (2005). Since January 2011, there has also been a cast bronze bust of Sean Connery created by Kirsipuu, and since 2015 a memorial bust of Admiral Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair. Kirsipuu also created the granite soldier sculpture on the Petseri County War of Independence Monument erected in 2020 (a copy of the original sculpture by Roman Haavamägi).\nIn 2019, the 6-meter (20 ft) metal sculpture Tallinn–Chengdu was completed in Chengdu, Tallinn's sister city. Works for public spaces by Kirsipuu can also be found in Latvia, Austria, and Changchun, China. Since 2007, she has created several sculptures of well-known Estonian cultural figures such as Matti Milius, Tõnu Aav, Andres Dvinjaninov, Ülo Vilimaa, Mark Soosaar, Hardi Volmer, Leonhard Lapin, and Peeter Laurits.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n2010: Anton Starkopf Fellowship\n2010: Kristjan Raud Art Award (portraits with a technologically innovative solution, Rollimäng 'Role play' sculpture exhibition)\n2019: Order of the White Star, Fourth Class\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In 1984, Zia ul Haq regime faced another attempt of coup d'état just four years after the 1980 attempt. This time the coup attempt came from leftists who wanted to overthrow Zia and establish a populist military regime in the country. The attempt was foiled by Inter Services Intelligence and all the plotters were arrested.\n\n\n== Plotters ==\nThe plot had it's initiation in 1982 when Major Aftab along with another major in Pakistan army, met with lawyer, philosopher and Marxist sympathizer, Raza Kazim at his residence.\nKazim was imprisoned just an year before for publishing a pamphlet against Ziaul Haq. The majors began expressing their dissatisfaction towards the regime of Zia ul Haq, but the majors did not inform him that they were planning to organise a coup against him.\nThese majors, along with a member of the Pakistan leftist intelligentsia, Ali Mehmood, continued to have secret meetings with Raza. Moreover,  Mustafa Khar, a former minister in the Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto regime  and a senior member of the Pakistan People's Party also got in contact with the plotters from his exile in the UK.\nKhar was requested by the plotters to help them overthrow . Moreover, Kazim was also asked to talk to some other anti-Zia officers in the military about history, philosophy and politics. It is not known exactly how the plotters had planned to execute the coup and how many officers in planning it. But according to Kazim, over 500 military officers and soldiers were interrogated by the military intelligence apparatus.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nIn late 1982, the plotters began  collecting funds to organise exiled Pakistani leftists in the UK. They plotters also planned that this money would also be used to stir up protests against the Zia ul Haq regime in Pakistan.\nKazim was a successful lawyer, and he agreed to give the plotters over Rs. 90,000 for the  planned coup d'état against the Zia regime.\n\n\n== Motive ==\nKazim in an interview told the Pakistan monthly magazine, Herald, that the plotters were planning to topple Zia and establish a populist military regime (headed by Major Aftab). Moreover, Khar had also suggested to the coup plotters that once the coup is successful Kazim should be given an important post in the new regime.\n\n\n== Arrest of plotters ==\nIn 1984, that Kazim realised that the coup was nipped in the bud by military intelligence apparatus before its planned execution. Seth Abid played as double agent and informing the military about the plot. All the conspirators were arrested, including Kazim. They were all given heavy jail sentences, but were released in 1988 by the first Benazir Bhutto regime.\n\n\n== Indian involvement ==\nAllegedly, some disgruntled army officers were provided details of a safe house where weapons procured from India directly by Mustafa Khar after negotiating with an Indian agent in their London High Commission. This has been discussed in great length and detail by Tehmina Durrani in her award-winning book 'My Feudal Lord' where she admits to playing a passive role under duress of her then husband Mustafa Khar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The ANZPT – Australia New Zealand Poker Tour was a southern hemisphere poker tour operated by PokerStars. It ran for seven seasons from 2009 before closing in 2015 after merging with the APPT – Asia Pacific Poker Tour.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ANZPT – Australia New Zealand Poker Tour was created in 2009 as a series of poker tournaments for local players in the Australia and New Zealand region, as the low entry (around AS2,000) were not attractive for professional players from US or Europe to travel so far to the region. This helped establish PokerStars live events in the region by encouraging local players to participate in tournaments under the PokerStars brand, glamour and prestige.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2015, several cities had the presence of ANZPT, in Australia they were: Adelaide, Sydney, Gold Coast, Perth, Canberra, Melbourne and Darwin and in New Zealand the cities chosen were Queenstown and Auckland.\n\nDuring the 7 seasons, several awards were distributed to the Players of the Year, with Tony Hachem being the biggest champion, winning two years in a row in the first and second seasons. Tony is the brother of Joe Hachem, the 2005 World Series of Poker main event winner. In 2013, Anthony Hachem, son of Joe Hachem won ANZPT Melbourne.\n\nAt the same time, PokerStars organized another tour in the vicinity, with the APPT – Asia Pacific Poker Tour even having some tournaments from seasons 5, 6 and 7 happening together, expanding the reach of the APPT tournaments in the Pacific.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced by Global Poker Tours Ltd., a subsidiary for live events of Amaya Inc. (owner of PokerStars between 2014 and 2019), that ANZPT would merge with APPT and the brand would cease to exist, with only APPT continuing to organize poker events in the pacific region. \"I have been very proud to be a part of the ANZPT,\" said APPT and ANZPT President Danny McDonagh. \"There have been many memorable stops including Darwin, Gold Coast, and Queenstown together with the big city venues such as Sydney and Melbourne. The tour has preserved the freeze out format in the $2,000 range, a decision vindicated by how popular the series has been with players.\"\n\n\n== ANZPT Main Event winners ==\n\n\n=== Season 1 (2009) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 1 (2009) – Leaderboard Champion:  Tony Hachem\n\n\n=== Season 2 (2010) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 2 (2010) – Leaderboard Champion:  Tony Hachem (2)\n\n\n=== Season 3 (2011) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 3 (2011) – Leaderboard Champion:  Daniel Chevalier\n\n\n=== Season 4 (2012) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 4 (2012) – Leaderboard Champion:  Mishel Anunu\n\n\n=== Season 5 (2012/2013) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 5 (2012/2013) – Leaderboard Champion:  Iori Yogo\n\n\n=== Season 6 (2013/2014) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 6 (2013/2014) – Leaderboard Champion:  David Lim\n\n\n=== Season 7 (2015) ===\n\nAustralia New Zealand Poker Tour – Season 7 (2015) – Leaderboard Champion:  Aristomenis Stavropoulos\n\n\n== External links ==\npokerstarslive.com\nAsia Pacific Poker Tour\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "During the Middle Ages, quodlibeta were public disputations in which scholars debated questions \"about anything\" (de quolibet) posed by the audience. The practice originated in the theological faculty of the University of Paris around 1230. Classes were suspended just before Christmas and Easter holidays so that the masters could hold public sessions taking questions from the audience. After 1270, the practice spread beyond Paris, but elsewhere was usually associated with the studia (schools) of the mendicant orders. Records of quodlibeta survive on parchment from the 1230s to the 1330s, but thereafter written records are scarce. The practice, however, continued into the sixteenth century.\nA catalogue of quodlibetal questions and manuscripts was published by Palémon Glorieux in two volumes between 1925 and 1932. Glorieux catalogued about 325 recorded quodlibeta by about 120 named authors and 30 anonymous quodlibeta. This amounts to over 6,000 individual questions. About half of quodlibeta and a definite majority of questions and manuscripts are attributed to Dominican or Franciscan scholars.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nQuodlibase: Base de données des Quodlibets théologiques (1230–1350)",

The party \"welcomes people from the pro-independence left to liberal Catalanism\" with the aim to work for \"the independence of Catalonia\".\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of March 2024, Jordi Graupera and Clara Ponsatí announced that on 23 April 2024 they would present a new pro-independence political proposal in the Catalan political environment at the Teatre Borràs in Barcelona, with a view to running in the elections to the Parliament of Catalonia which were scheduled for February 2025. The scheduling of elections for 12 May 2024 by Catalan President Pere Aragonès has accelerated the process of party creation. The press conference presenting the proposal was attended by Clara Ponsatí, Jordi Graupera, Ada Ferrer and Anna Punsoda, group promoting the party.\nTo be able to stand in the elections, they need 5,703 signatures, divided by demarcations: 4,243 in Barcelona, 596 in Tarragona, 546 in Girona and 317 in Lleida. The promoters of the project asked for volunteers for the signature collection process. On 2 April 2024, they confirmed that they already had the necessary signatures.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dazaifu Gakkōin (大宰府学校院跡)  was a university in Nara and Heian period Japan, located in what is now the city of Dazaifu,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1949, with the area under protection adjusted in 1970.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Dazaifu Gakkōin was an institution for training government officials. It was located between the Dazaifu Government Office and Kanzeon-ji Temple. Although it is not clear when it was established; it is believed to have been founded with the implementation of the Ritsuryō system following the Taika Reforms. Along with importing a structure of government modeled after Tang China,  the fledgling Japanese state also imported the concept of a civil service examination system administered for the purpose of selecting candidates for state bureaucracy based on merit rather than by birth. This was intended to lead to the rise of a gentry class of scholar-bureaucrats which could offset the power of hereditary aristocracy and the military. The Dazaifu Gakkōin first appears in historical documentation in 781, in which it was recorded that the school had 200 students from six provinces of Kyushu. Subjects necessary for government officials, such as politics, medicine, arithmetic, and writing were taught, using books such as the Four Books and Five Classics. Under the Ritsuryō system, each province was to have a national academy, where if a student completed the required subjects within a given year and passed an exam, he would be hired as an official; however, the six provinces of Chikuzen, Chikugo, Buzen, Bungo, Hizen, and Higo had no such facility, and students were all sent to the Dazaifu Gakkōin. The school appears to have ceased operating around the end of the Heian period.\nArchaeological excavations starting in 1969  found the foundations of four buried-pillar buildings. Two are thought to be one-by-two bay warehouse-style buildings, and one was a four-by-seven bay building with eaves extending north and south, that is thought to be the central building. It is estimated that this building dates back to the first half of the Heian period. Seven buried pillar foundation buildings, a north–south ditch, and the remains of an earthen rampart-like structure were discovered on the eastern side of the site. The buildings were rebuilt three times, with the oldest foundations dating from the latter half of the Nara period. The north–south ditch existed from the Heian period into the Muromachi period. The complete extent of the site has yet to be determined.\nThe site is approximately a 15-minute walk from Tofurōmae Station on the Nishitetsu Tenjin Ōmuta Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)\nDazaifu Heritage(in Japanese)\nKyushu National Museum(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The New York Crusade was a major evangelistic campaign conducted in 1957 in New York City by Billy Graham. It was preceded by two years of preparation and lasted from May 15 to September 1 (16 weeks). It was the largest evangelistic campaign ever organized in New York City.\nIn addition to Graham, the gathered audience heard speeches from then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Pastor Martin Luther King, among others. 97 evangelistic meetings took place in the then-current Madison Square Garden arena on Eighth Avenue, with an average attendance of 17,828 people. Additionally, special meetings with Graham were held at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, Times Square, Yankee Stadium, and several other locations. The largest gathering occurred at Times Square, with 125,000 attendees.\nThe Crusade was daily reported on by The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. Graham's campaign was criticized by liberal theologians, Protestant fundamentalists, and proponents of racial segregation. The New York evangelistic crusade marked the beginning of televangelism – a new form of religiosity based on media.\n\n\n== Preparations and costs ==\nIn 1954, the Protestant Council of New York invited Graham to conduct an evangelistic crusade. Graham declined but encouraged the inclusion of Protestant churches not affiliated with the council. In the summer of 1955, the council again proposed the idea, and on December 9, a positive decision was made, forming a committee for the crusade. This committee included representatives from non-council churches. Around 1,700 denominations participated, not only from New York but also from Long Island, Westchester, and five New Jersey counties.A group of twenty volunteers was organized, operating for two years. Fifteen of them belonged to liberal Protestant churches, and five to fundamentalist ones. 250,000 songbooks and 100,000 copies of the Gospel of John were prepared for the evangelistic crusade. A choir of 4,000 people from New York churches was organized, with 2,000 members rotating each evening. 6,000 volunteers offered to assist during the crusade. Approximately 5,000 prayer groups were organized in the US, and 10,000 in 75 countries, to support the New York Crusade. Additionally, nightly prayer sessions for the crusade's success were held in New York.In early 1957, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association released a brochure titled Why We Must Go To New York, in which Billy Graham explained that 58% of New York residents did not identify with any religion. Protestants comprised only 7.5%, and many had loose ties to their churches. The goal of the crusade was to attract new believers to the churches and encourage less active Christians to become more engaged.It was planned that meetings would take place at Madison Square Garden every evening from 7:30 to 9:15 PM. About one-third of the seats were reserved before the crusade began. Most ticket reservations came from New Yorkers, but participants also came from Louisville, Nashville, Detroit, Buffalo, Washington, Philadelphia, and even from cities as far as Oklahoma City.On May 11, Graham met with President Dwight Eisenhower to finalize organizational matters related to the crusade. The conclusion of the crusade was initially planned for June 30, with the possibility of extension if attendance remained high. It was extended three times; on June 3, the decision was made to extend it to July 20 due to the significant interest in the early weeks. On July 19, it was extended to August 10, and on August 3, it was decided that the last meeting at Madison Square Garden would be on August 31.At the beginning of 1957, Billy Graham estimated that the cost of the crusade would be $850,000. The New York Times estimated at the outset of the campaign that its total costs would be $1.3 million, not including Graham's evangelistic group's expenses. The actual cost of the crusade was $2.5 million. Sponsors included William Randolph Hearst (Jr.), publisher Henry Luce, aviator Eddie Rickenbacker, and Norman Vincent Peale, one of the most well-known preachers in New York. John D. Rockefeller Jr. sent a check for $50,000. A daily collection was taken; during the first four days, the amounts collected were:\n\nMay 15 – $9,123\nMay 16 – $6,600\nMay 17 – $7,659\nMay 18 – $7,768\n\n\n== Course of the crusade ==\n\n\n=== Madison Square Garden ===\nThe opening ceremony took place on the evening of May 15 at Madison Square Garden. Almost all the seated places were occupied on the first night (19,000). Delegations from 112 Protestant churches attended and occupied about 6,000 seats. Graham's first sermon was published by The New York Times the following day.The New York Herald Tribune commented daily on the evangelization in a column titled Billy Graham Says. ABC Television agreed to sell its airtime on Saturdays. The first broadcast took place on June 1, attracting over 6 million viewers. It is estimated that around 96 million viewers watched at least one of the fourteen television broadcasts. This marked the beginning of a new type of religiosity, based on media – televangelism.On July 1, the influential magazine LIFE featured Graham speaking at Madison Garden on its cover. From July 2, all-night prayers for spiritual support were held in ten New York churches. The prayers continued until the end of the crusade.\nDuring this crusade, Graham identified communism as the main threat to the world. One of the most famous sermons Graham delivered during this crusade was Is Your Heart Right. It referenced the latest report from the Surgeon General of the United States on heart diseases, which was released that year, but the sermon's content focused on spiritual heart diseases. Graham asked the audience, Is your heart healthy? and urged, You can be healed!, You can have a new heart. Following this sermon, Dr. Carpenter remarked that Graham could address significant cultural phenomena without changing the fundamental message of his sermon.In addition to Billy Graham, other speakers included Martin Luther King (July 18), Mordecai Ham (May 29), and other preachers and evangelists. Popular American soloists such as George Beverly Shea, Ethel Waters, and Jerome Hines provided music ministry. Beverly Shea performed the Christian hymn How Great Thou Art 99 times, thus contributing to its popularization. Martin Luther King arrived on July 18, and Billy Graham introduced him by saying, A great social revolution is taking place in the United States today. Dr. King is one of its leaders, and we appreciate that he could take some of his time to come and share his ministry with us.\n\n\n=== Special meetings ===\nIn addition to the regular meetings at Madison Square Garden, one-time gatherings took place in various parts of New York. Special outdoor meetings were organized at different locations in New York City. On May 19, on the occasion of Norway's Independence Day, Graham spoke at Leif Eriksson Park in Brooklyn. 40,000 people gathered there. On May 25, a meeting was held at the West Side Tennis Stadium (Long Island). One-time meetings took place in Central Park, Harlem, and Wall Street. On June 30, Graham preached on the steps of Salem Methodist Church in Harlem (5,000 participants), on July 7 in Central Park (9,000), and on July 10 on Wall Street where about 30,000 people gathered, including many businessmen. The meeting in Harlem was organized to encourage African American residents of New York to participate in the crusade. On July 13, in the afternoon, a special meeting for Spanish-speaking residents of New York took place near Madison Square Garden. It was the first time Graham spoke through a translator in the USA. On July 14, he spoke on the steps of Cornerstone Church in Brooklyn.On July 20, a meeting was held at Yankee Stadium, attended by over 100,000 people (over 10,000 were unable to enter). The New York Times noted that never before in the history of the stadium had such a large crowd gathered. That day, the choir consisted of 4,000 people. One of the speakers was Vice President Richard Nixon, who greeted the audience on behalf of President Dwight Eisenhower. Nixon said, As a nation, we can be great only if we have faith in God. In his sermon, Graham listed the following threats facing America: communism, the hydrogen bomb, racism, and moral decline. He believed there was only one way to overcome these problems – hope in Jesus Christ.On September 1, about 125,000 people gathered in Times Square (according to various estimates, between 75,000 and 200,000). In his sermon, Graham spoke about serving false gods. He said, Let us tell the whole world tonight that we Americans believe in God.... Let us tell the whole world that spiritually and morally we are as well prepared as economically and militarily.Morning Bible hours were led by Paul Rees, from Monday to Friday, with the first Bible hour taking place on May 20.\n\n\n=== End of the crusade ===\nThe meeting at Times Square is considered the official conclusion of the crusade. On September 2, Graham returned to his home in Montreat.Despite the crusade officially ending on September 1, from September 25 to October 1, Graham organized several additional meetings, the largest of which had 10,000 attendees. Further meetings took place from October 20 to 27, with the final one occurring at the Polo Grounds stadium, where Graham spoke to 40,000 people. Some, like Wilfred Bockelman, consider this meeting the actual end of the crusade. On October 31, the crusade office at 165 West 46th Street, which had been operational for two years, was closed.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBilly Graham was listened to by approximately 2.4 million attendees in total. In terms of the number of listeners, this evangelization reached greater proportions than all the previous ones conducted in New York, including the 1917 evangelization by Billy Sunday (approximately one million participants). After the crusade, the number of people attending churches increased, but not to the extent expected. 6,000 to 10,000 new members joined Protestant churches.According to Graham's team, during the crusade, 56,767 people made the decision to dedicate their lives to Christ (each of them provided their address on so-called decision cards). 7,947 of them had no previous affiliation with any denomination, while the rest belonged to churches (86%). In this group, 63% attended church regularly, meaning at least once a month (according to a survey). Regarding the question of what making the decision to dedicate their lives to Christ entailed, the responses were as follows:\n\nAccepting Christ as Savior and Lord (for the first time in life) – 59%\nAssurance of salvation – 6%\nRededication – 10%\nRenewal of faith – 5%\nReaffirmation of faith – 15%.According to John Pollock, Graham's biographer, the number of signed \"decision cards\" was around 61,000. The \"converted\" were directed to various churches. The largest number, 373, was allocated to the liberal Protestant church Marble Collegiate Church. Henry J. Pratt estimated that this was the first time the Protestant Council of New York came into direct contact with its faithful.Additionally, based on the letters received by BGEA, it was reported that 65,000 television viewers were converted.During the crusade, three important factors came into play, on which American evangelicalism was divided: liberal theology, evangelical fundamentalism, and the fight for civil rights for African Americans. The extent to which the crusade contributed to discrediting liberal theology, marginalizing evangelical fundamentalism, and highlighting Martin Luther King's struggle has not yet been fully examined by historians.After this crusade, Billy Graham lost approximately 14 kg of body weight and was physically exhausted.In 1958, the film The Heart is a Rebel was made, starring Ethel Waters in the lead role. The film was inspired by Graham's New York Crusade.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nH.B. Shaffer, at the beginning of the crusade on June 5, compared it to Billy Sunday's 1917 crusade and recalled that the press also predicted failure then, announcing it as \"Billy's Rubicon\" because New York was considered \"the graveyard of evangelists\". According to Shaffer, New York is the ultimate test of an evangelist's power.During this crusade, Billy Graham pushed his ecumenism further than ever before. He stated that he would send participants of the crusade back to their own churches – Catholic, Protestant, Jewish... and the rest to God. This statement was later reiterated in interviews for the San Francisco News published on September 21 and November 11.In the fundamentalist Protestant community, voices emerged labeling Billy Graham as the Antichrist. The reason was his referral of \"converts\" to various churches: liberal Protestant, fundamentalist Protestant, Adventist, Catholic, and even Jewish synagogues. According to these critics, Graham sent people who had entrusted their lives to Christ to churches that reject Christ's teachings. Pastor Carl McIntire recalled Graham's statement from 1948, in which he said that the World Council of Churches was heading towards choosing an Antichrist, and then commented that Graham was now helping to build churches that were part of it. The following year, Ernest Pickering criticized Graham on behalf of fundamentalist Christians. Just after the San Francisco crusade, Pickering published a pamphlet stating that Graham had been a tool of God and had done much for fundamentalist Christianity in his time, leading it out of obscurity and making the Gospel a national good, but in recent times, he had turned away and drawn closer to liberals. Pickering reminded that during the Scotland Crusade (1955), Graham stated, I am not a fundamentalist. He pointed out that during the New York Crusade, \"converts\" were sent to liberal churches, and of the money remaining after the crusade, $67,618 was donated to liberal churches in New York. Fundamentalist Christian money was used to support modernists. Pickering called on all fundamentalist Protestants to cease supporting Graham's crusades from then on.Among the staunch critics of Graham from the fundamentalist side was Bob Jones, who had previously believed that Graham's activities were not the work of God. Jones could not accept the fact that the crusade was funded by liberal Protestant churches. Jones criticized Graham for organizing integrated crusades for blacks and whites, believing that whites and blacks would never want to sit beside each other, and racial segregation would always exist in the church.J. A. Johnson called Graham the \"Jehoshaphat of our time\". John C. Whitcomb accused Graham of apostasy, which he allegedly committed in 1957.Criticism also came from liberal Protestants. A certain Christian publisher accused Graham of wanting to roll back religion fifty years. Others accused him of doing more harm to Christianity than anyone else in two thousand years. Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, even during the crusade, wrote a critical article in Life, accusing him of simplifying life's problems and offering too easy solutions. However, he praised Graham for his crusades not being as common and commercialized as Billy Sunday's crusades. Niebuhr initiated criticism of Graham among theologians.Only one critical article came from the Catholic community, written by an official from the National Catholic Welfare Council. He wrote that Catholics should not participate in Protestant religious ceremonies, and that Billy is a threat to faith. According to Graham, this was the only opposition from the Catholic side, and none of the known Catholic hierarchs spoke out against the evangelization of New York.John A. Mackay, a Presbyterian theologian and ecumenist, and rector of the liberal Princeton Theological Seminary, positively evaluated the crusade. He stated that the participants of Graham's crusade would be more responsible and effective in fulfilling their duties in society. He believed that the Christian community would be strengthened, social structures would be transformed, and thus the Kingdom of God would be brought closer. However, he noted that the consequences of the crusade would largely depend on local churches and cooperation between them.Norman Vincent Peale, a preacher from the Marble Collegiate Church and the creator of the theory of positive thinking, wrote to Graham on October 22 that his spiritual life had become stronger and deeper thanks to his sermons, and his church had been wonderfully led since the time of the crusade.Uta Andrea Balbier assessed in 2009 that the New York Crusade was the most expansive undertaking in the history of American evangelicalism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billy Graham's crusades\nLos Angeles Crusade (1949)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBalbier, Uta Andrea (2009). \"Billy Graham's Crusades In the 1950s: Neo-Evangelicalism Between Civil Religion, Media, and Consumerism\".

        "content": "Keka  is a 2008 Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film directed by Teja and starring Ajay, Anoop Kumar and Ishana. The film was released to highly negative reviews.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDubbing artists\n\nNavdeep for Raja\nAjay for Kiran\nRaasi for Ishana\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film featured thirty-six newcomers including Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry's son Raja. The heroine was renamed Ishana by Teja after being unnamed by her family due to astrological reasons. Initially Chennai-based Ilaiyaraaja was to compose the music but after Teja fell sick and couldn't shift between cities, he opted for Hyderabad-based Chakri. The film was shot in sixty days in Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Rajasthan. The film was partially reshot in Tamil as Manase Manase, but that version was never released.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was released on 26 October 2008. A critic from Rediff.com rated the film two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"Director Teja seems to have got embroiled in the stereotypical pattern of filmmaking. Gone is the freshness associated with his films (as his earlier films Chitram and Jayam reflect). One can't help but wonder if he has lost his touch\". A critic from IANS rated the film one out of five and wrote that \"Keka is a movie three years too late\". A critic from 123telugu wrote that \"Director Teja knows how to make love stories. He only knows how to make love stories. And there are only so many love stories he can make. That is his real problem. He keeps trying to pour his old wine into newer and better bottles all the time, but it does not really help\". A critic from Indiaglitz rated the film zero out of five and wrote that \"In short, Teja's Keka is one more dud that desperately fails to impress. It just reaps an ultimatum for the creative director\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKeka at IMDb",

        "content": "The 2024 Spring Breakin' is an upcoming professional wrestling event produced by WWE for its developmental brand NXT. It will be the third annual Spring Breakin' professional wrestling event and will air as a two-part special episode of NXT. The television special will take place on April 23 and April 30, 2024, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida and air on the USA Network.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSpring Breakin' is an annual professional wrestling television special produced by WWE. The inaugural Spring Breakin' event was held as a special episode of NXT, on May 3, 2022 and took place at NXT's home base of the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. The second Spring Breakin' took place on April 25, 2023, thereby establishing Spring Breakin' as an annual Spring event for NXT. On the April 9, 2024 episode of NXT, it was announced that the third Spring Breakin' would take place on April 23 and 30, 2024, albeit expanded to a two-part special.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe card will include matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results are predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines are produced on WWE's weekly television program, NXT, and the supplementary online streaming show, Level Up.\nAt Vengeance Day on February 4, Trick Williams, who was accompanied by Carmelo Hayes, failed to win the NXT Championship from Ilja Dragunov. After the match, Hayes attacked Williams with a steel chair, ending their partnership and turning heel in the process. At Roadblock, The D'Angelo Family's Tony D'Angelo defeated Hayes to become the #1 contender to the NXT Championship at Stand & Deliver. After the match, Williams made his return and attacked Hayes in the ring. The following week on NXT, Williams challenged Hayes to a match at Stand & Deliver. At Stand & Deliver on April 6, Dragunov successfully defended his title while Williams defeated Hayes. On the following episode of NXT, Williams called out Dragunov to challenge him for the NXT Championship. Dragunov agreed to a title match at Week 1 of Spring Breakin' on the condition that Williams must leave NXT if he loses, which Williams accepted.\nIn December 2023, Tatum Paxley developed a deranged obsession with then-NXT Women's Champion, Lyra Valkyria. Over the next few months, Tatum interfered in Valkyria's matches, even helping Valkyria retain the title at Vengeance Day in a triple threat match also involving Roxanne Perez. At Stand & Deliver on April 6, Perez defeated Valkyria to win the title despite interference from Paxley. On the following episode of NXT, Valkyria confronted Perez and demanded a rematch later that night, only for Paxley to toss her into the steel steps, ending their partnership and turning Paxley heel in the process. On the April 16 episode in a cinematic vignette, Paxley said that she wanted to be close to Valkyria and that she was being a good girl by helping Valkyria remain champion, but after losing her title, Valkyria meant nothing to Paxley, who expressed her desire to become champion. After Paxley's match with Thea Hail, Valkyria attacked Paxley. In a backstage segment later that night, NXT General Manager Ava announced that Perez will defend her title against Valkyria and Paxley in a triple threat match at Week 1 of Spring Breakin'.\nIn early 2023, an unidentified person was behind the attacks that left several members of the women's division on the shelf. One of the victims of the attacks was Sol Ruca, and footage of the attack was shown at Spring Breakin' 2023 on the April 25 episode of NXT. On the May 30 episode, the attacker was revealed to be Blair Davenport. At Roadblock on March 5, 2024, after an 11-month hiatus, Ruca returned from injury and attacked Davenport, costing her a match against Fallon Henley. One month later on the April 2 episode of NXT, Ruca defeated Davenport in a singles match. Two weeks later, Davenport knocked Ruca off the top rope, costing her a match against Lola Vice. Later that night backstage, Ruca demanded NXT General Manager Ava to schedule a No Disqualification match against Davenport at Week 1 of Spring Breakin'. Ava accepted the demand, and scheduled the match as a Beach Brawl.\nOn the April 9 episode of NXT, during a backstage segment between members of No Quarter Catch Crew (Charlie Dempsey, Damon Kemp, and Myles Borne), members of The D'Angelo Family (Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo, Luca Crusifino, and Adriana Rizzo) challenged No Quarter Catch Crew to a tag team match later that night, where Lorenzo and Crusifino defeated Kemp and Borne. The following week, No Quarter Catch Crew revealed that they hired The D'Angelo Family to eliminate (kayfabe) No Quarter Catch Crew member Drew Gulak, but Tony D'Angelo said that No Quarter Catch Crew needed to pay him and his crew for their actions. Dempsey said that they needed to \"take care of some trash\" and The D'Angelo Family did that to do the industry some good in the process. D'Angelo wanted somebody to pay up and insinuated that he should be given the NXT Heritage Cup as payment before the two teams brawled. After that, a six-man tag team match between The D'Angelo Family and No Quarter Catch Crew was scheduled for Week 1 of Spring Breakin'.\nOn the March 26 episode of NXT, Lola Vice issued an open challenge, which was answered by Raw's Natalya, who defeated Vice. Two weeks later, Vice attacked Natalya, costing her the NXT Women's Championship. Later that night, Natalya retaliated and attacked Vice backstage. One week later, Natalya challenged Vice to the first-ever women's NXT Underground match, which was scheduled for Week 2 of Spring Breakin'.\n\n\n== Matches ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWWE NXT official website",

Sprout helps brands communicate with customers across social channels, collaborate across teams, and measure the effectiveness of their efforts.\nSprout's platform integrates with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google+, Zendesk, UserVoice, Feedly, and Google Analytics. Bambu by Sprout Social, launched in August 2015, is an employee advocacy platform that allows organizations to curate content for employees to read and share on social media.\nSprout Social was founded in 2010 by Justyn Howard, Aaron Rankin, Gil Lara, and Peter Soung. Howard Justyn of Sprout Social is on Crain's Chicago 40 Under 40 2014 list. Sprout is a privately held company backed by venture capital funds including Goldman Sachs, New Enterprise Associates, and Lightbank.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn late 2009, current Sprout Social CEO Justyn Howard worked for an enterprise software company. He was looking for a tool to help him use social media to connect and communicate with customers. He found that solutions on the market were consumer-focused and needed more business components to make social media work for brands. So he set out to build a solution, working alongside current Sprout CTO Aaron Rankin, Creative Director Gil Lara, and Director of Web & Mobile Engineering Peter Soung.\nSprout Social, Inc. was founded in April 2010. The company has raised a total of $60 million, including a $1 million initial funding round in 2010 led by Lightbank, $10 million in Series B funding from New Enterprise Associates (NEA) in February 2011, and $42 million in Series C funding from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and NEA.\nIn November 2011, Sprout released S2, the second generation of the platform that is the basis of the current model. This release included customizable dashboards tailored to each user's social media responsibilities, support for multiple users, iPhone functionality, various options for strategic partner integrations, and more.\nIn April 2015, Sprout released Spanish and Portuguese language support.\nIn August 2015, Sprout launched Bambu by Sprout Social, an employee advocacy platform.

The species is the only known lancelet species found in New Zealand, rarely being caught for having specific habitat needs of clean coarse sand. It inhabits these sandy areas around the North Island and northern parts of the South Island at depths up to 55 meters below sea level, with one recent individual being found on the coasts of Urquharts Bay near the Whangarei Heads in 2023 after being stranded in a puddle during low-tide.\n\n\n== References ==",

It depicts the French monarch Charles X awarding legion of honours to artists who exhibited at the 1824 Paris Salon at a ceremony held on 15 January 1825. The King who had succeeded his brother Louis XVIII in 1824 is shown in the uniform of the National Guard. It features portraits of many of the leading artists of the era.  The royal official Ambroise-Polycarpe de La Rochefoucauld and the director of the Louvre Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste de Forbin are shown close to the king. Heim became a celebrated depicter of scenes of the Bourbon Restoration. It is now in the collection of the Louvre and is displayed in the Salon Carré.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBouillo, Eva. Le Salon de 1827: classique ou romantique?.

        "content": "The Sea Tsar (Russian: Морской царь, sometimes inverted for emphasis: царь морской) is a character in East Slavic folktales and bylinas, the tsar of the sea realms. The best known examples are bylinas about Sadko and  fairy tales about Vasilisa the Wise, such as The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise. Vsevolod Miller suggested that the image of the Sea Tsar was influenced by the Finnish god Ahti, known for the pomors (Russian seashore dwellers of the Russian North). Also Miller doubted that the image of Sea Tsar in these fairy tales reflects old East Slavic pagan beliefs and is probably based on the tales of itinerary storytellers. The Sea Tsar should not be confused with the water spirit, vodyanoy.\n\n\n== The Sea Tsar and Sadko ==\n\n\n== The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise ==\n\n\n== Sea kings of South Slavs ==\nSome draw the parallel of the Sea Tsar with the tale about South Slavic morski kralj recorded, e.g., by  Slovenian poet and ethnologist Matija Valjavec in his 1890 collection Narodne pripovjesti u Varaždinu i okolici (Folk Tales from Varaždin and its Vicinity), also published by Franc Hubad in his Pripovedke za mladino collection (referring to Valjavec). The tale in question (in both references) is called \"Čudotvorni lokot\" (\"Magic Padlock\").\nAndrijana Kos-Lajtman and Jasna Horvat notice that in the tale \"Magic Padlock\" the sea king is not written with capital letters and there is nothing particular of sea surroundings, i.e., the sea is not a determining feature of the tale. It addition it turns out that the sea king also has a cat, clearly a non-maritime animal.\nThis is a story about a young man who rescues a dog, a cat, and a snake. Snake's mother gives him a magic padlock which fulfils his wishes. The padlock helps him to win the (land) king's daughter for a bride. A sea king comes to visit the (land) king, notices how the young man operates the padlock, steals it, and orders to bring the castle and the bride to the sea. The cat and the dog steal the padlock back, the young man wishes the castle and the bride back, and the sea king as well, whom they roast on a spit.\nAnother sea king (morski kralj) is in the elaborate literary fairy tale Ribar Palunko i njegova žena (Palunko the Fisherman and His Wife) by Croatian writer Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić. However her Sea King has nothing in common neither with that of Valjavec, nor with the Sea Tsar from the East Slavic folklore.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lila Neuenfelt (March 2, 1902 - October 8, 1981) was the first woman circuit court judge in Michigan and the youngest woman in the U.S. to become an attorney.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLila Neuenfelt was born on March 2, 1902, in Lewiston, Michigan, one of six children. Neuenfelt graduated from Highland Park High School in 1919 and from the University of Detroit School of Law in 1922. She needed to wait six months to turn 21 before she could be admitted to Michigan's state bar. She became the youngest woman lawyer in the United States at the time.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1926, Neuenfelt was a clerk for judge Leo Schaefer in Springwells, village; Schaefer suggested she run for judge. Upon winning election, she become the youngest and first woman judge in Michigan, earning extensive news coverage at the time. The Detroit Free Press ran a full-page article with the headline \"Girl Judge’s Small, Soft Voice Awes 'Bad Men'\". However, Neuenfelt didn't wanted to be recognized as a female judge, stating that gender \"makes no difference with the administration of the law\". As she started to compete with Schaefer for future votes, they developed an adversarial relationship. In 1929, Neuenfelt ran a recall election against Schaefer, who in turn planted illegal alcohol in the back of her car. In 1932, both Neuenfelt and Schaefer ran for congress against each other, with neither winning.\nIn 1935, upon running for re-election, the corporate counsel of Dearborn ruled that she would need to run under her married name; Neuenfelt successfully petitioned the court and the state attorney general, and continued to use her maiden name.\nIn 1940, Neuenfelt issued a ruling declaring an anti-union ordinance that prohibited the distribution of handbills unconstitutional. The Ford Motor Company appealed but her ruling was upheld.\nIn 1941, Neuenfelt was elected to the Michigan Circuit Court; she became Michigan's first female circuit court judge.  Neuenfelt was once approached by a union member over an injunction she had issued, and responded by threatening Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa with her \"16 gauge automatic shotgun\". Hoffa later endorsed Neuenfelt in her following election.\nNeuenfelt served as a circuit court judge in Michigan until her retirement in 1968.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nNeuenfelt died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on October 8, 1981, at the age of 79.\nShe is remembered for her accomplishments in a time when there were very limited opportunities for women in law, and noted for becoming a lawyer only two years after the 19th Amendment was passed.\nNeuenfelt was a mentor to Cornelia Kennedy, who served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\nIn 2021, Neuenfelt was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in recognition of being the first female circuit judge in Michigan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo footage of Lila Neuenfelt taking the oath of office in 1925 on YouTube",

The story revolves around the dynamic duo's attempt to take down the corporate machine responsible for irreversibly altering the art of game development from the production of meaningful, creative works into endlessly producing soulless cookie-cut cash cows, riddled with microtransactions and privacy violations.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe comic follows Rick as he attempts to save Morty from the clutches of corporate evil. The story kicks off as Morty blindly agrees to the terms of service on the latest hit mobile app - effectively signing his life away. He is later abducted by the corporate creators of the app for their nefarious purposes. Rick must come up with some crazy invention to save his most loyal companion from the clutches of corporate society. However, things take an unexpected turn when Morty unknowingly allows the company to steal Rick's interdimensional portal gun, stranding the duo in alternate dimension while the greedy corporate drones steal all of Rick's inventions and use them for evil.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Esquivel y Fuentes (27 December 1869–1955) was a Mexican poet, priest and public speaker from the town of Santa María Tepepan, in what is today the Mexico City's borough of Xochimilco. He was better known for his poetry collection called \"Tepepam, Poesías\", on which he worked from 1932 until his death in 1955, constantly adding new poems, deleting older ones and frequently changing the structure and contents of the others throughout the eight published editions.\nWhile it seems that, unbeknownst to him, by the end of his life he had gained a bit of notoriety in Mexico City's literary and artistic circle, after his death his work fell back into obscurity, in which it mostly remains to this day.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nJuan Esquivel y Fuentes was born in the town of Santa María Tepepan, in a place called Tlacomultenco, on 27 December 1869. He was the youngest son of his mother, Sóstenes Fuentes, but his father died when he was still an infant. During his childhood he grew up in abject poverty, which was commonplace for rural Mexico in the late 19th century. He was taught to read and write at a young age by the local priest's mother; however, he did not receive proper schooling because of the lack of a permanent school in Tepepan, having instead intermittent classes given by a traveling teacher.\nBetween the ages of ten to fifteen, due to the dire economic situation of his family, he was forced to work in the states and ranches around Tepepan, in the nearby Tlalpan and Xochimilco regions, either as a farmhand, a courier, a gardener or doing any other heavy work that was needed. During this time he continued with his basic education; however, he had to interrupt it sometime before age fifteen.\nAt the age of sixteen, in 1885, he and his mother had to move out of Tepepan after his older half-brother, Pedro Biscerril, kicked them out of their home. They settled in the center of Mexico City, near what today is the Templo Mayor archeological site. There he worked as the doorman and night guard of a building, getting to live with his mother in the doorman's quarters.\nHe was admitted to a school close by where he was allowed to study in exchange for menial work. After a year of going to this school, he excelled at the final exams, rising above his classmates and coming to the attention of archbishop Pelagio Antonio de Labastida y Dávalos, who gave Esquivel a place in Mexico City's Conciliar Seminary, where he started his formation as a priest.\n\n\n=== Higher education and religious career ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nEsquivel y Fuentes, Juan (1932).

The highest placement obtained by them is the top 20 finalists; won in 2016 and 2017 by Wannasai Paksee and Phattharamalin Nasawasd, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2016, after Miss Grand Thailand began franchising the provincial competitions to individual organizers, who would name seventy-seven provincial titleholders to compete in the national pageant, the license for Trang province from 2016 to 2019 was granted to a local medical doctor, Yuttana Sitapakpuranan (ยุทธนา ศิตภัคปุรานันท์), who organized the first contest of Miss Grand Trang on 10 April 2016; however, the winner later resigned from the title and the replacement was then assigned.The pageant was skipped once; in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, the national organizer was unable to organize the national event, and the country representative for the international tournament was appointed instead.\nWinner gallery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following table details Miss Grand Trang's annual editions since 2016.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== National competition ==\nThe following is a list of Trang representatives who competed at the Miss Grand Thailand pageant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Miss Grand Trang at Wikimedia Commons\nMiss Grand Thailand official website",

        "content": "The Hunterdon County LINK is a bus system in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The system offers fixed-route and demand-response services throughout the county. The system is operated by the Hunterdon County Department of Human Services, and operated by Easton Coach Company. From 2011 to 2020, it was operated by First Transit.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hunterdon County LINK system started in 1984. From 1984 until 2016, service consisted mainly of demand response service. The only fixed-route buses were the Flemington Shuffles (routes 16 and 20). In March 2016, the county's bus system was redesigned. Demand response service was retained, but four new routes (routes 14 through 18), collectively branded as the \"Cross County Shuffles,\" were introduced, replacing key demand response corridors. In addition to this, a new \"Out of County Shuffle\" route was introduced, the route 23, running from Flemington to Somerville in Somerset County. As a part of this service redesign, the Flemington Shuffles were also modified, with the route 20 (Evening Flemington Shuffle) being removed and the route 19 being added as a reverse run of the route 16. In January 2019, a bus shelter was added to the LINK Transfer Center in Flemington. \n\n\n== Routes ==\nHunterdon County LINK operates eight routes.\n\nIn addition, demand response service is operated throughout the county.\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nHunterdon County LINK currently operates exclusively minibuses. In the past, however, full-size buses have been used.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "\"The Forgotten Bride\" or \"The Forgotten Fiancée\" is a motif of folktales recognized in several folktale motif indices.\nIt was first recognized by Reinhold Köhler. It is a motif of endings of some tales, which can comprise several motifs.It may be found, e.g., in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature as \"D2003. Forgotten fiancée. Young husband visiting his home breaks tabu and forgets his wife. Later she succeeds in reawakening his memory\".Sith Thompson classified it as 313C, adding it as a subtype of Antti Aarne 313: \"The Magic Flight\", most commonly a follow-up of the motif 313A \"The Girl as Helper in the Hero's Flight\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAccording to Stith Thompson, after escaping from the villain's lair in a Magic Flight, the hero's female helper warns him against doing a certain action at home (e.g., being kissed by his mother or licked by his dog), lest he forgets his adventures. Despite her warning, the hero practices the taboo and forgets about her, eventually being betrothed or marrying another woman. The heroine then can buy from the false bride three nights in the hero's bed and makes him remember, or uses birds talking to each other to make him recover his memory.\n\n\n== Related motifs ==\n\n\n=== The Oblivion Kiss ===\nIn some variants of tale type ATU 313, \"The Magical Flight\", the story continues with a sequence called \"The Forgotten Fiancée\", with motif \"Kiss of Oblivion\". As noted by professor Dean Fansler, the \"Kiss of Oblivion\" incident occurs because the hero breaks a taboo that the maiden warns against (\"usually a parental kiss\"). The hero's true memory only reawakens on the day of the wedding with the new bride.\n\n\n=== The Sale of Bed ===\nThe Forgotten Fiancée \"often includes\" the incident known as \"Sale of Bed\": the heroine purchases from the hero's false bride the right to spend three nights with him. Since he is drugged with a sleeping potion, the heroine only succeeds in the third night.\n\n\n== As a tale type ==\nIn the second revision of the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index (henceforth, ATU), published in 1961 when the index was still called Aarne-Thompson Index (henceforth, AaTh), Stith Thompson catalogued tale type AaTh 313 as \"The Girl as Helper in the Hero's Flight\", which he decomposed in six parts (I, II, III, IV, V and VI). Parts IV to VI refer to the \"Forgotten Fiancée\" sequence, which follows the \"Magic Flight\". Thompson also reserved the latter three portions as part of subtype AaTh 313C, \"The Forgotten Fiancée\". However, German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther, in his revision of the index, published in 2004, subsumed the sequence and the subtypes back into the more general type, creating new type ATU 313, \"The Magic Flight\".The East Slavic Folktale Classification (Russian: СУС, romanized: SUS) classifies it as «Забытая невеста». (СУС 313 С).\n\n\n== Notable examples ==\nSigrid Schmidt recorded a variant in Namibia. A young man falls in love with a daughter of a cannibal named Seven Heads. Seven Heads gives him tricky jobs to do, but the daughter helps him out, and eventually helps him to escape. When he comes home he forgets the girl and plans to marry another one. But Seven Head's daughter eventually manages to make him to remember. Sigrid Schmidt wrote that some Namibian peoples immigrated to the country from  South Africa, where they lived in contact with Boers and most probably picked a substantial amount of tales from them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\nGoldberg, Christine (1992). \"The Forgotten Bride (AaTh 313 C)\".

Kris Mayes is an Arizona Supreme Court case in which the court upheld an 1864 law criminalizing abortions except to save the life of the mother.On April 9, 2024, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in Planned Parenthood of Arizona v. Mayes that the 1864 law could be enforced, to take effect 14 days later, but with no retroactive enforcement. As a result, abortion in Arizona became illegal, except for when it is \"necessary to save\" the life of the pregnant individual. There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and the legally prescribed sentence for assisting in an illegal abortion is 2-5 years in prison.Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, responded to the Arizona Supreme Court decision by declaring that \"as long as I am Attorney General, no woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this draconian law in this state.\" Mayes criticized the Arizona Supreme Court for having \"risked the health and lives of Arizonans\", after \"effectively striking down a law passed this century and replacing it with one from 160 years ago ... when Arizona wasn't a state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn't even vote\".Arizona for Abortion Access, a campaign intending to introduce a November 2024 ballot proposal to protect abortion within the Arizona Constitution, is gathering signatures up to July 2024 for their petition to introduce the amendment.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona, Inc., v.
