        "content": "Felipe Ferrer Carreras (5 April 1890 – 1986) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Mallorca, Levante, and Valencia.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn in Palma de Mallorca in 1890, Ferrer was the first player from Alfonso XIII, current RCD Mallorca, who went on to play in the First Division. From the age of 8 to 16, he lived with his family in Argentina, so he trained as a footballer in the vacant lots of the city of Buenos Aires, popularly known as potreros. Upon his return to the Balearic Islands, he began playing as an inside left player for Alfonso XIII, always appearing in the lineups of the late 1920s like Felipe.\nA player with great technique and a powerful shot, he became champion of Mallorca at only 18 years of age and played in a national championship within the Catalan Group. In the 1933–34 season, he signed with Levante, where he spent two seasons before going to play in Asturias with Real Oviedo, in the First Division, with whom he played five official matches and scored two goals. Oviedo, which finished third after Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid, had a great team, with a forward line made up of Casuco, Gallart, Lángara, Herrerita and Emilín in which it was almost impossible to find a place, but Ferrer still managed to achieve it five times, but he lacked continuity and the arrival of the Spanish Civil War definitively cut his career short.\nAfter the war, he returned to the island to play for Mallorca, and in 1939 he arrived at a Valencia team that had a dream squad. On some occasions he helped put together a luxury forward line with Epi, Vicente Asensi, Mundo, and Gorostiza, but he did not enjoy real opportunities. He only played one league game in two seasons. From Valencia he went on loan only for the Cup matches to Murcia, and later signed with Málaga in the 1941–42 season. After it ended, at the age of thirty, he returned to Mallorca, playing with Atlético Baleares and Poblense. Felipe Ferrer died in Argentina in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

Both of them then joined Athletic Club, with Eguía making his debut on 17 March 1913, in the semifinals of the 1913 Copa del Rey, in which Athletic won 3–0 against Real Madrid, and then he featured in the final on 23 March in which Athletic lost 0–1 to Racing de Irún, the courtesy of a goal from Manuel Retegui. He went on to play a pivotal role in Athletic's three consecutive Copa del Rey titles between 1914 and 1916, starting in two finals, helping his side to a 2–1 victory over FC Espanya in 1914, and then to a 4–0 trashing of Madrid FC in 1916.\nNotably, Eguía also participated in the inaugural match of the San Mamés stadium, on 21 August 1913, in which he assisted Pichichi to the first goal in the history of the cathedral. Eguía retired in 1918, at the age of 28, having played 42 official matches, which was a very high number for the amateur era.\nProfessionally, Eguía was a carpenter, being a strict worker who disarmed his opponents with the same care he showed in carpentry. Eguía died on 20 May 1934, at the age of 44.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAthletic Club\n\nBiscay Championship:\nWinners (1): 1914, 1915, and 1916\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1913\nWinners (3): 1914, 1915, and 1916\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Daniel Díaz de León Castillo, better known as Pirelo (8 February 1910 – 1 January 2006), was a Mexican footballer who played as a midfielder for Spanish club Celta de Vigo. He was also a manager.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nDaniel Díaz de León was born in Chihuahua City, Mexico, to Spanish parents, and when he was young, his family moved to Galicia, where he began playing football for Eiriña CF, with whom he played three seasons of the Tercera División (1929–30, 1931–32, and 1932–33), and was the Galician amateur champion in 1932–33. His performances eventually drew the attention of Celta de Vigo, then in the Segunda División, who signed him in 1933, thus becoming the first Mexican footballer in the club's history. In his first season at the club, he helped the team win the Galician Championship. In total, Díaz de León scored 8 goals in 30 games in two seasons for Celta before leaving in 1935, returning to Eiriña CF. After the Spanish Civil War, Celta returned to the official competition, and in order to do so in the First Division, it was required the renewal of a squad that had been devastated by the war and the break. Among other signings, Celta carried out a series of negotiations with Eiriña for the signing of several footballers, among whom was the Mexican Pirelo. In gratitude for the magnificent disposition of the Pontevedra team, Celta played a free match in their field, in which Pirelo occupied the midfielder position.\nDíaz de León thus made his La Liga debut in the first league match of the 1939–40 edition, which was also Celta's debut in the Spanish first division, which ended in a 3–2 loss to Zaragoza on 3 December 1939. In doing so, he became one of the first Mexican footballers to play in La Liga. In Celta's first year in the first team, Pirelo was practically undisputed, playing 19 games out of 22, at a time when substitutions did not exist. In the second campaign, he was also quite complete, but with the arrival of reinforcements, mainly the Canaries, he lost prominence, and in its last year (1941–42), he only played four games. In total, he played 62 matches for Celta, scoring 8 goals.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nOn 23 April 1941, Pirelo had the honor of forming the Celta eleven that defeated Deportivo de La Coruña 8–0 in Balaidos in the second leg of the round of 32 of the 1941 Spanish Cup; Celta went on to reach the semifinals after beating Real Madrid in the round of 16 and Real Oviedo in the quarterfinals. He also managed Pontevedra CF in the 1948–49 season.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nCelta de Vigo\nGalician Championship:\n\nWinners (1) 1933–34\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ciriaco Cuesta Sanz (16 March 1907), also known by his nickname Cuestita, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Atlético Madrid. He is considered by some as the most important Segovian player in history.\nHe later worked as a manager.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nCiriaco Cuesta was born in Sanchonuño, Segovia, on 16 March 1907, and he began his football career at Deportivo de La Coruña in 1928, at the age of 21. While there, he stood out as a great striker, so he was signed by Atlético Madrid in 1929, for whom he played in the inaugural La Liga season in 1929. In its December 1929 issue, the illustrated magazine Gran Vida dedicated its cover to the \"football star\" from Segovia, and defined him as an \"admirable player, a master of possessing devilish mobility\". Since his emergence into the first division, everything has been praise for Cuesta \"despite his doll-like figure\", and the press of the time in general agreed in warning that with his presence, Atlético's game had \"more life, \"more union, more danger for the enemy.\" Cuesta was also described as a player \"with easy and quick dribbling in his actions and the ability to score goals\".\nAt the end of the 1929–30 season, however, the club's permanence in the First Division was in serious danger, since they needed a win in the final matchday to avoid relegation against the already crowned league champions Athletic Bilbao, and although Cuesta netted twice in the first half, they ultimately lost 4–3 and were relegated to the Segunda División. He remained at Atlético for seven years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, playing a total of 62 competitive matches, including 47 in the league and 15 in the Copa del Rey. By this alone, Cuesta is considered by some as the most important Segovian player in history.\nAfter his professional journey, Cuesta returned to Segovia to receive a tribute on 31 May 1936, in a match between Gimnástico FC and Atlético in front of a large audience in the stands, which ended with a comfortable victory to Atlético (4–7) minimized in a second half because several red and white players change teams to balance the clash.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Cuesta played one season for Imperio CF, where he retired in 1940 and then made his debut as a coach later that same year. He also managed Gimnástica Segoviana CF between 1947 and 1949.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lighthearted and Blue is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in October 1964 by Capitol Records and was her fifth studio album. It was the first studio project released following the death of Shepard's husband in a plane crash in 1963. The album was a collection of 12 cover songs that was reviewed positively by both Billboard and AllMusic. It was her first album to make the US country chart as well.\n\n\n== Background, recording and content ==\nJean Shepard had first broke through into mainstream country music with a pair of singles with Ferlin Husky in 1953. As a solo artist, she broke through in 1955 with a pair of top ten singles. As the decade progressed, Shepard's commercial success waned, partially due to influx of rock and roll and the Nashville Sound crossover country style. In 1963, Shepard also lost her husband Hawkshaw Hawkins in a plane crash. Shepard considered abandoning her career altogether following the accident. Ultimately, she chose to refocus her priorities and continue her music career. Lighthearted and Blue was Shepard's first studio album following the accident.\nLighthearted and Blue was recorded at the Bradley Film & Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Sessions for the project were held between August 1963 and January 1964. The project was produced by Marvin Hughes, Shepard's first album produced by him after ten years recording with Ken Nelson. The album was a collection of 12 tracks. It was theorized that the album's conceptual focus on sad material was due to Shepard's grief following the death of Hawkins. The 12 songs were all covers tunes from the country music field. This included Roger Miller's \"When Two Worlds Collide\", Lefty Frizzell's \"If You've Got the Money, I've Got the Time\" and Freddie Hart's \"Loose Talk\".\n\n\n== Release and critical reception ==\n\nLighthearted and Blue was released by Capitol Records in October 1964. It was Shepard's fifth studio album in her career and her first since 1962's Heartaches and Tears. It was distributed as a vinyl LP offered in both mono and stereo formats. Six tracks were featured on either side of the record. Lighthearted and Blue was among 20 LP albums that Capitol issued in the fall of 1964. Billboard gave the album a positive reception, calling it \"one of her finest\". \"Jean once again demonstrates in this album why is one of the best loved and most respected performers and consistent record sellers in the C&W field,\" they wrote. AllMusic rated the album three out of five stars, calling it her \"comeback album\". Lighthearted and Blue was Shepard's first album to make the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart. That year it reached the number 17 position and would be the start of a series of LP's to make the same chart.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sorrelsykes House is a historic building in West Burton, North Yorkshire, a village in England.  It is noted for the follies in its park.\nA manor house, named Sorysikes Meadow, was constructed on the site in the early 17th century.  It was demolished in the early 19th century, and a new country house was built.  It was altered in 1921, with the addition of a block at the rear, giving it a rectangular plan.  The building was later divided into four houses, and it was grade II listed in 1988.\n\nThe house is built of stuccoed brick, with quoins, modillion gutter brackets, and a stone slate roof, hipped on the left.  There are two storeys, a partial basement and attics, and an east front of nine bays.  The middle three bays project under a pediment, and contain a doorway with an architrave and a cornice on consoles.  To the left is another doorway containing a fanlight with a chamfered quoined surround and a round-arched architrave.  The left bay contains a two-storey canted bay window, and most of the windows are sashes, with a variety of surrounds.  In the left return is a semicircular bay window.\n\nIn the parkland around the house are four follies.  Their date of construction is uncertain, but they may have been built by four sisters of the Tennant family in the 1870s.  At the top of a scree slope is a sham ruin, originally resembling a castle, though it was damaged in a storm in 1992 and little survives.  It is said to have been constructed to hide earlier lead mine workings.  The other three follies are better preserved, and two are grade II listed.  The Pepper Pot is in stone and has a circular plan.  There are two stages, the lower stage slightly tapering, the upper stage concave, each with a projecting top course of stones, surmounted by a conical cap.  On the west side is a very small doorway.  The Rocket Ship is also built of stone, and has a base in the form of a cube with tapering diagonal buttresses.  On the west side is a narrow doorway with a blind oculus above, and at the top is flagged coping. The base is surmounted by a tapering circular obelisk containing two blind round-headed vents and with flagged capping.  The unlisted folly is a stone arch, sometimes described as a gateway, but too low to walk through.  The follies were restored in 1993.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burton-cum-Walden\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Silencers (American band) are a rock group formed in Pittsburgh, PA, in 1979. They released two albums on Precision Records, a CBS Records subsidiary, hitting the national charts in 1980 with their single, Shiver and Shake.  Their innovative music video aired on the very day of MTV's network premiere in 1981. The original group disbanded in 1985, but is currently enjoying a resurgence, with original vocalist Frank Czuri and early member Michael Cercone on bass.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1979, Pittsburgh singer Frank Czuri started producing demo tapes of original music for producer Tom Cossie's Precision Records , a subsidiary of CBS Records. Soon, Czuri was talking with Pittsburgh guitarist Warren King about forming a band to be called The Silencers. Both had previously performed in a popular mid-1970s rock band called Diamond Reo, which released three well-reviewed albums, a cover of Ain't That Peculiar (which remained on Billboard's Hot 100 for six weeks), and toured nationally, opening for bands like Kiss and Aerosmith. \nTogether, Czuri and King recruited Silencers' members Dennis Takos on keyboards, Mike Pella on bass, and Ron \"Byrd\" Foster on drums. Before they had even played their first gig, Cossie had managed to land them a two-album record deal with Precision Records, based solely on the band's demo tape. Soon, The Silencers would become the premiere rock band in the Pittsburgh region with their raucous covers and original material that combined rock, New Wave, R&B, soul, and reggae. They toured nationally and opened for acts such as Hall & Oats, AC/DC, and Heart.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe Silencers' debut LP, Rock'n'Roll Enforcers was produced by Bob Clearmountain and yielded two singles: Modern Love and Shiver and Shake, the second of which charted nationally and was named by Pittsburgh Magazine as one of the all-time 10 best local artists' recordings.  Billboard Magazine said of Rock'n'Roll Enforcers: \"The Silencers are armed with a hard hitting debut. Fronted by the aggressive vocals of Frank Czuri...the Silencers show an amazing command of rock history…This is slashing rock which goes for the jugular.\"\nThe band's second LP, Romanic, was released in 1981 and featured all original material. It yielded the single Sidewalk Romeo (Angel of Mercy), which received heavy regional airplay. \n\n\n== MTV Video ==\nA stylish video of the Silencers' Peter Gunn/Remote Control/Illegal medley  aired on MTV on the day the network premiered - August 1,1981 - and received heavy rotation. It was the 40th song ever shown on the network.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nOriginal Members:\n\nFrank Czuri - lead singer, songwriter (1979-1983, 2019 to present)\nWarren King - lead guitarist, songwriter (1979-1983)\nDennis Takos - keyboards (1979-1983)\nMike Pella - bass (1979-1981)\nMichael Cercone - bass (1981-1985 and present)\nRon \"Byrd\" Foster - percussion (1979-1985)\nMembers, 2019 to present: \n\nDon Hollowood - current\nEd Kowalski - current\nJack Mrzowski - current\nJoe Cipollone - current\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nRock-n-Roll Enforcers  - 1979, Precision/CBS Records\nRomanic  - 1981, Precision/CBS Records\nSingles & EP\n\nShiver and Shake  - 1980, Precision Records, (Warren King & Cathy Capiola)\nPeter Gunn Theme  - 1980, Precision Records, (Henry Mancini)\nRemote Control/Modern Love  - 1980 EP - Epic Records (Warren King, Cathy Capiola & Frank Czuri)\nSidewalk Romeo  - 1981, Precision Records (Frank Czuri, Warren King, Dennis Takos, Michael Harbadin)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Richard \"Rick\" Hill (born January 26, 1953) is an American actor, author, and former gridiron football player. He is perhaps best known for his appearances in several films from veteran producer Roger Corman, including playing the title role in two installments of his Deathstalker series. He also collaborated with controversial baseball figure Pete Rose on his autobiography.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nHill was a three-sport letterman for Perrysburg High in Perrysburg, Ohio. In football, he twice won MVP honors in the Northern Lakes League, and was also a league all-star in basketball. He was recruited by the Georgia Tech football program, but his career was plagued by injuries.\nBefore 1972, NCAA players were required to spend a year on a freshman team before graduating to the varsity team. Despite a slow start which he attributed to an ankle sprain, Hill led the so-called \"Baby Jackets\" in ground gains, in part because future College Hall of Famer Randy Rhino was moved to defense. Hill's sophomore year started slow again on a weak team, and he was redshirted partway into the season, although head coach Bill Fulcher called him \"probably as good a back as we have at Tech\".\nHill came out strong in the 1973–74 campaign and led the team with six touchdowns by early November, when he suffered a ligament tear that took him out of action for the rest of the schedule. Unsure if he would even be able to play until late into the pre-season, Hill took the field for the 1974–75 campaign but was quickly sidelined with a hamstring injury. He recovered and helped a rejuvenated Tech offense to several school records in the final stretch. \nHill was a Rhodes Scholarship nominee at Georgia Tech, from where he graduated in 1975 with a major in business. Thereafter, he briefly enrolled at Emory University to study law, before attempting to turn pro. Hill trained with the Detroit Lions of the NFL, but did not make the team. He signed a contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL in the spring of 1976, but suffered a dislocated shoulder during the preseason and left training camp with no appearance on record in the regular season.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nHill's acting break came when he was scouted at a Los Angeles beach and offered the small part of a lifeguard in a production called One of a Kind.\nThe same setting begat a leading role in Beach Patrol, the 1979 pilot for a proposed Aaron Spelling series, although the show was not picked up.\nHill was able to capitalize on his athletic background to keep his career going: he played a college football star (albeit from Michigan) in Detour to Terror, an NBC telefilm starring and produced by O.J. Simpson, and had a recurring role as another football player on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives. He also guest-starred as a varsity football player on an episode of Charlie's Angels, another Spelling production. In 1981, he was cast in Today's FBI, a re-imagining of classic show The FBI, which ran for a single season on ABC. In the later stages of his career, Hill has occasionally worked as a director of episodic television.\nIn 1983, Hill made his theatrical debut in Deathstalker, which was part of a wave of heroic fantasy films that followed Conan The Barbarian. The film was profitable for Roger Corman's New World Pictures, and Hill subsequently starred in several action films for Corman (including the third Deathstalker sequel) and his associate Cirio Santiago. Hill also appeared in Warrior Queen, a film aping the Deathstalker template but made by another exploitation producer, Harry Alan Towers. In 1994, he played a secondary protagonist in the final installment of the Class of... series, Class of 1999 II. Around the same time, the actor made another push for a leading role with Immortal Soldier, an android film which he co-wrote and was to feature genre veterans Maria Conchita Alonso, Jeff Wincott, Robert Davi, Michael Ironside and Louise Fletcher. However the project, promoted by newcomers Hatch Entertainment, did not materialize.\nIn the 1980s, Hill was a member of the Hollywood All-Stars, a touring celebrity softball team raising money for various charitable causes.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nEarly in his entertainment career, Hill expressed an interest in writing, and was working on a spec script based on his college recruiting experience. A baseball fan, he wrote another about the life of Jim Eisenreich, who battled through Tourette syndrome to become a Major League player. After that one was optioned, his agent tried to pitch him as a writer for a planned biopic of Pete Rose, a fellow Ohioan with whom Hill had become acquainted at a 1986 celebrity softball game. While neither film projects panned out, Rose read the Eisenreich script and chose Hill to write a tell-all book about his life. In the resulting opus, My Prison Without Bars, Rose admitted to betting on MLB games for the first time, an accusation he had steadfastly denied before.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nNote: This Rick Hill is not to be confused with several homonyms, including an Australian actor and a kickboxer who appeared in Bloodfist II for his frequent employer Roger Corman.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRick Hill at IMDb\nOfficial website\nRick Hill stats at SRCFB",

        "content": "Gingras (alternatively Gingri) was a type of flute used by the Phoenicians, particularly in their mourning rituals. Information about the gingras comes from second-century AD Greek rhetorician Athenaeus in his work \"The Deipnosophists,\" where he reports the accounts of Xenophon, Democleides, Corinna, Bacchylides, Antiphanes, Menander, Amphis, and Axionicus about the instrument and its sound.\n\n\n== Description and use ==\nDescribed by Xenophon as about a nine inches in length, the gingras was a wind instrument that produced a shrill and mournful tone. According to Democleides, the name \"gingri\" is derived from the lamentations for Adonis, as the Phoenicians referred to their god as \" Adonis Gingres\".  Amphis describes the gingras as a new invention of the Phoenicians. The instrument is also mentioned, according to Atheneus, by fifth-century BC lyricists Corinna, Bacchylides, by the fourth-century BC poet Antiphanes in his work \"The Physician\", and by late fourth-century BC Athenian poets Menander in \"Karine,\" and Amphis in \"Dithyrambus\". The Gingras is believed to have been also used by the Carians in their lamentations.\n\n\n== In extant ancient sources ==\nAthenaeus reports the following ancient snippets that mention the gingras. In \"Phileuripides,\" Axionicus compares the love for the melodious strains of Euripides to an illness, stating that to those afflicted, every other music seems as shrill as the gingras and a mere misfortune.\n\nIn another passage from Dithyrambus by Amphis, a character says that he has acquired an excellent gingras, a new musical instrument. Although it has never been presented in any theater, he asserts that it is a luxury enjoyed at Athenian banquets. When asked why he doesn't introduce it to everyone, the character explains that he fears drawing too enthusiastic an audience, as they would disrupt everything with their applause.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNabla – Musical instrument\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Palazzo Manetti is a 15th Century Italian palazzo, located at Via Santo Spirito 23 in Florence.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe palace was built in the early decades of the fifteenth century for the Manetti family, on properties owned by them since the second half of the fourteenth century. Among the prominent figures of the family was Giannozzo Manetti, a humanist and translator of Aristotle, who was disliked by Cosimo the Elder. Therefore, with the return of the pater patriae to Florence, he was forced to leave the city, first moving to Naples and then to Rome, where he initiated the collection of the Vatican Library.\nThe palace reached its peak in the eighteenth century when it was rented to the British diplomat Horace Mann, Resident Minister of the British Government, who opened the building to Florentine high society.\nFrom 1737 onwards, there is an extensive correspondence with Horace Walpole, son of the Minister Sir Robert Walpole, in which he meticulously describes everything that happens in Florence, from the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici to that of the Electress Palatine (falling \"ruining\" the carnival), up to the arrival of the Lorraines. A painting by Thomas Patch entitled Gentlemen in the House of Horace Mann, once owned by the antiquarian Enrico Hughford, remains of that Florentine salon.\n\nThe Manetti family owned the palace until the end of the eighteenth century, when it passed to the Gondis, the Fumagallis, and, at the beginning of the twentieth century, to the Cesaroni Venanzi family. The present appearance heavily reflects nineteenth-century interventions, which have altered both the facade and the interiors, especially in the part facing the garden.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarcello Vannucci, Splendidi palazzi di Firenze, Le Lettere, Florence 1995 ISBN 887166230X\nFrancesco Cesati, La grande guida delle strade di Firenze, Newton Compton Editori, Rome 2003.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The middle finger of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was removed from his body posthumously. In 1737, 95 years after he died, his remains were transferred to a mausoleum at the Basilica di Santa Croce. Antiquarian Anton Francesco Gori, anatomist Antonio Cocchi, and Italian marquis Vincenzio Capponi removed the finger of Galileo's right hand as well as one of his vertebra, an index finger, a thumb, and a tooth.\nThe middle finger passed to Angelo Maria Bandini, who exhibited it at the Laurentian Library. In 1841, the finger was moved to the Tribune of Galileo at La Specola. It was transferred to the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in 1927. Galileo's middle finger is part of the collection of the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy. The finger is encased in a gilded glass egg.\n\n\n== Background ==\nItalian astronomer Galileo Galilei died in 1642 and had stipulated in his will that his remains go to Basilica di Santa Croce, beside those of his father, Vincenzo Galilei. Authorities from the Catholic Church did not want him to be buried on consecrated grounds given his views on Copernican heliocentrism, which were considered heretical at the time. Cardinal Francesco Barberini addressed the matter, writing that people might be scandalized by his entombment in the mausoleum. Instead, his remains were placed in a small enclosure near the Chapel of Saints Cosimo and Damiano.\nIn 1688, Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stipulated in his will that his fortune should be used to establish a mausoleum for Galileo. The mausoleum was not constructed until well after Viviani's death, delayed at first by the potential disapproval of the Catholic Church and later by the \"dillydallying\" of Viviani's nephew and heir, Abbot Jacopo Panzanini.\n\n\n== Removal from corpse ==\nNinety-five years after his death, on 12 March 1737, Galileo's remains were transferred from an unconsecrated box underneath the Santa Croce bell tower to a memorial tomb inside of the church, near Michelangelo's fingers and bones. In a ceremony resembling the transfer of a saintly relic, Galileo's remains were taken from his heretic's grave to the mausoleum of the Basilica di Santa Croce.\nThe botanist Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti was in attendance at the transfer and had brought a knife. Anatomist Antonio Cocchi, Italian marquis Vincenzio Capponi, and antiquarian Anton Francesco Gori used the knife to remove the middle finger from Galileo's corpse, along with his thumb, index finger, one of his teeth, and his fifth lumbar vertebra. The tooth, index finger and thumb were placed in a handblown glass base and remained with the Capponi family until the beginning of the 20th century. Tozzetti later wrote that Capponi's explanation for taking the two fingers as relics was \"because Galileo wrote so many beautiful things with them.\" The vertebra was donated to the University of Padua by Domenico Thiene in 1823.\n\n\n== Exhibition history ==\nThe middle finger was later acquired by Angelo Maria Bandini of the Laurentian Library where it was exhibited. In 1841, the finger was moved to the Tribune of Galileo at the Museum of Physics and Nature (now La Specola) along with Galileo's Medici-Lorraine instruments. In 1927, it was moved to the Institute and Museum of the History of Science (Museo di Storia della Scienza). The museum's inventory originally listed the finger as his left index finger, though University of Florence professor Francesco Leoncini added a footnote indicating that it was Galileo's right middle finger.\n\nIt eventually came to be included in the collection of the Museo Galileo. The finger is encased in an egg-shaped glass display above a cylindrical marble base. The base includes a commemorative inscription by astronomer Tommaso Perelli. According to the museum, Galileo's middle finger \"exemplifies the celebration of Galileo as a hero and martyr of science\". The finger is displayed alongside the objective lens from Galileo's telescope.\nThe Latin inscription of Tommaso Perelli:\n\nLeipsana ne spernas digiti quo dextera coeli\nMensa vias nunquam visos mortalibus orbes\nMonstravit, parvo fragilis molimine vitri\nAusa prior facinus cui non Titania quondam\nSuffecit pubes congestis montibus altis\nNequidquam superas conata ascendere in arces.\n\nSpurn not the remains of the finger by which the right hand measured out paths of the sky, pointed to orbs never before seen by mortals; with the aid of a small pile of fragile glass first dared the deed to which Titania, in full vigor, on mountains heaped high, was once inadequate, having tried in vain to ascend into the loftiest heavens.\n\nAmerican journalist Nino Lo Bello wrote in 1986 about his attempts to track down Galileo's finger in the 1960s. He reported being told by an employee of the National Library that it had resided there for years before it was given to the Museum of the History of Science.\nGalileo's middle finger is a rare example of a secular relic, the preservation of body parts being a practice usually reserved for saints within the Catholic Church. Bonnie Gordon remarked on the \"the irony of preserving relic style the remains of a heretic\". British art critic Julian Spalding remarked that the Museum of Science took pride in the finger, adding \"I don't particularly recommend going to see it, because what is the point of looking at Galileo's finger?\"\nIn Italy, Galileo's middle finger is considered the property of the state.\n\n\n== Galileo's other body parts ==\nTwo of Galileo's other fingers, his index finger and the thumb of his right hand, and a tooth were sealed in a glass jar that disappeared sometime after 1905. Rufus Suter wrote in 1951 that the other two fingers were said to be preserved in the reliquary of Dr. Luigi Rosselli del Turco in Florence. They turned up at auction in 2009 and were turned over to the Museum. To ensure their authenticity, the museum had the DNA of the remains tested. One of Galileo's vertebra is kept at the University of Padua.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnd yet it moves\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMiddle finger of Galileo's right hand, Museo Galileo",

        "content": "The West Burton Obelisk is a historic structure in West Burton, North Yorkshire, a village in England.\nThe obelisk was constructed in 1820, on the village green.  It is often described as being a market cross, but there is no record of a market ever having been held in the village.  It is possible that it may have been used as a preaching cross.  The structure was restored in 1889, when its top was replaced by a ball and weathervane, the old top being incorporated into a barn.  The obelisk was grade II listed in 1952.\nThe octagonal obelisk is built of stone, a mixture of rubble, stone slabs, and ashlar.  It resembles a church spire, set on a base of five steps.  Part way up is a band with a carved Maltese cross, and the dates of erection and restoration, and at the top is a ball finial and a weathervane.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burton-cum-Walden\n\n\n== References ==",

Carly, associated with the Better Homes in America movement. It was built for drugstore manager Ernest Kimberlin and was advertised as the \"Anne Hathaway Cottage\" due to its intended similarity to the home of William Shakespeare's wife, located in Warwickshire, England.\nThe Anne Hathaway Cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Reactions to the Israel–Hamas war include significant geopolitical divisions emerged. Much of the Western world provided \"strong\" support to Israel militarily and diplomatically, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany although the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\", according to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive\". In contrast, the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the \"moral authority of the West\" and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights. The double standards, in their view, is condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel that has occupied Palestinian lands.\nThe United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid.\n\n\n== Israel ==\n\nA public opinion poll conducted on 23–28 October by the polling company iPanel in collaboration with Tel Aviv University found that 57.5% of Israeli Jews believed the IDF was using \"too little\" firepower in Gaza, while 36.6% thought the amount of firepower was \"appropriate\", 4.2% were not sure, and only 1.8% thought the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower. In contrast, 50.5% of Israeli Arabs believed that the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower in Gaza. According to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, only 10% of Israeli Jews would support a pause in the war in Gaza to allow an exchange of Israeli hostages. A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza. 75% of Jewish Israelis rejected the Biden administration's calls to change the IDF's strategy to one that \"reduces the heavy bombing of densely populated areas.\"\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Hebrew University on 7–9 December on the post-war handling of Gaza, 56% of Israelis opposed the annexation of Gaza with 33% in favor. When questioned on who should administer Gaza in the immediate post-war period, 23% supported a coalition of moderate Arab states, 22% Israeli military rule, 18% an international force, 18% Israeli annexation and 11% the Palestinian Authority. The Direct Polls survey found that 83% of Israelis supported encouraging the voluntary emigration of residents of the Gaza Strip. According to a poll published by the Israel Democracy Institute, 91% of Israeli Jews and 24% of Israeli Arabs believe that the IDF is making an effort to follow international law.\nIn an Israel Democracy Institute survey of 510 Israeli citizens in early February 2024, 68% of survey respondents supported preventing all international aid from entering Gaza.\nAround 170 Palestinian citizens of Israel were arrested for posts supporting Palestinians in Gaza, which featured quoting Quran verses, \"prayers for the people of Gaza, and political analysis of Israeli military operations\". Between 1 October and 1 November, the number of Palestinians held in administrative detention, without charge or trial, rose from 1,319 to 2,070. Prisoners have been subject to torture and at least four prisoners have died in Israeli custody. The ethics panel of the Knesset voted to suspend politician Ofer Cassif for 45 days over anti-Israel statements in interviews he made after the war broke out. Following a rally in support of Gaza in Haifa, police commissioner Kobi Shabtai threatened to send antiwar protesters to the Gaza Strip. As of 18 October 63 people have been arrested in Israel on suspicion of supporting or inciting \"terror\" since the start of the conflict, according to Israeli police.\nAmidst the escalating violence, Magen David Adom initiated a blood donation drive and the Education Ministry closed schools on 7 October, transitioning to online learning from 15 October. Various events and performances were cancelled or postponed including the Haifa International Film Festival, a Bruno Mars concert, and football matches scheduled by UEFA. The Israeli energy ministry ordered Chevron to temporarily shut down the offshore Tamar gas field. Following a significant drop in the value of the New Israeli Shekel, the Bank of Israel announced that it would sell up to $30 billion in foreign reserves in its first-ever sale of foreign exchange.\n\n\n=== Emergency unity government ===\n\nOn 11 October, an emergency unity government was formally announced between Likud and National Unity following a joint statement from the latter party, with Benny Gantz, a former defence minister and military chief of staff, joining a war cabinet also consisting of Netanyahu as Prime Minister and Yoav Gallant as Defence Minister. The statement said the unity government would not promote any policy or laws except those related to the ongoing fighting with Hamas. It significantly reduces the influence of Netanyahu's previous far-right coalition partners over the conduct of the war, which was one of Gantz's demands. Haaretz reported that former IDF chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer would join the war cabinet as observers.\nOn 29 October, Netanyahu blamed security chiefs for Hamas's attack in a post on X (formerly Twitter); this was later deleted following criticism.\n\n\n=== IDF whistleblowers ===\n\nSources identified as IDF officials have spoken to the press under the condition of anonymity regarding military strategies and culture resulting in unprecedented human losses. Among the concerns are applications of artificial intelligence, such as the programs Habsora (\"the Gospel\"), Lavender, and \"Where's Daddy?\" that identify and track targets potentially linked to Hamas with minimal human oversight. Policy changes include expanding the threshold of acceptable civilian casualties and deliberately hitting targets in their homes, often killing entire family lines. A senior IDF official expressed concern about soldiers \"shooting first and asking questions later,\" particularly in the cases of IDF killing of Israeli hostages and the World Central Kitchen aid convoy attack.\n\n\n== Palestinian territories ==\n\n\n=== Gaza ===\nReactions in Gaza ranged from anger at the international community's response to fear. The territory faced numerous major crises. The Israeli blockade caused significant difficulties, including a lack of food, medicine, and water. A pediatrics doctor at Kamal Edwan Hospital described the situation in Gaza as \"really dangerous\", stating that, as a result of Israel's denial of clean water, babies in his ward were experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Schools in the Gaza Strip were closed until further notice. Yahya al-Sarraj, the mayor of Gaza City, commented that the Israeli siege was a violation of international law and urged the international community to \"support the victims\".\n\n\n=== West Bank ===\nInitially, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinians' right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\" and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\". Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinians.\nFollowing the attack, celebrations occurred in Nablus. France 24 reported \"Hamas called on \"resistance fighters in the West Bank\" to join the battle. Neighborhood watches were established in 50 locations amid fears of reprisals by Israeli settlers, while a general strike was called for 8 October. Seven Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces on 7 October, while 126 others were injured. As of 19 October, Al Jazeera reported that 76 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and Jerusalem, eight of them by armed Israeli settlers; the Palestinian Health Ministry said that 61 people have been killed and 1,250 injured in the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners Club said that 850 Palestinians, including lawmakers, prominent figures, journalists, and former detainees have been arrested by Israeli authorities since the start of the war.\n\n\n== International ==\n\nOn 7 October 2023, a large escalation of the Gaza–Israel conflict began with a coordinated offensive by multiple Palestinian militant groups against Israel. A number of countries, including many of Israel's Western allies, such as the United States and a number of European countries, condemned the attacks by Hamas, expressed solidarity for Israel and stated that Israel has a right to defend itself from armed attacks, while countries of the Muslim world (including the Axis of Resistance) have expressed support for the Palestinians, blaming the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories as being the root cause for the escalation of violence. The events prompted several world leaders to announce their intention to visit Israel, including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nNumerous countries called for a ceasefire and de-escalation. International organizations, student organizations, charities, ecumenical Christian organizations, and Jewish and Islamic groups commented on the situation. On 27 October 2023, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce and cessation of hostilities, adopted by a vote of 121 states to 14, with 44 abstentions. As of 6 November 2023, Bolivia has severed diplomatic relations with Israel, while Bahrain, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, South Africa and Turkey have recalled their ambassadors from Israel, citing Israeli actions during the war.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It consisted of men aged from 34 to 49 who were considered too old and insufficiently trained to serve in an active or reserve regiment.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe Territorial Army was created by law on 27 July 1872 which established the principles of the military reserve.\nThis law established a military service obligation of twenty years for French men as follows:\n\nfive years in the active army;\nfour years in the Army Reserve;\nfive years in the Territorial Army;\nsix years in the Territorial Army Reserve.\n\n\n== World War I ==\nOn 1 August 1914, France decreed a general mobilisation of its armed forces. A total of 145 territorial infantry regiments were formed at the start of hostilities. In addition, the Territorial Army formed cavalry squadrons, artillery groups, engineering battalions, and logistics units.\nThe Territorial Army was not intended to serve on the frontline. However, territorial units in the northern and eastern regions were engaged in battle to defend their towns and villages.\nThirteen territorial infantry divisions were formed to guard the Spanish and Italian borders, provide coastal defence against a German naval landing, and provide a reserve around Paris. As these threats receded, these divisions were gradually moved towards the frontline.\nOn August 1st, 1918, all existing territorial regiments were disbanded and their men distributed among the active and reserve regiments. Starting in January 1919, the Territorial Army began demobilising.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johann Rudolf von Sporck or Spork (27 November 1755 – 10 February 1806) served as an Austrian general during the French Revolutionary Wars. He fought in the Austro-Turkish War in 1789–1790. He led an infantry regiment in 1792–1793 and was promoted Generalmajor at the beginning of 1794. He fought in the Flanders campaign in 1792–1794 and in the Rhine campaign of 1795. After being transferred to Italy, he led a brigade at Lonato, Rovereto, and Calliano in 1796. He was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant in 1797 and led a division in 1800 at Engen, Messkirch, and the Iller River. In 1801 he became the inhaber (proprietor) of an infantry regiment. He died in 1806.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nJohann Rudolf von Sporck was born on 27 November 1755 in Prague. His noble parents were Johann Karl, Graf von Spork and Theresia Gräfin von Thürheim. His sisters were Maria Karolina Josefa von Clam-Gallas (1752–1799) and Maria Josefa (b. 1753). Johann Rudolf joined the army of the Habsburg monarchy at an early age. On 27 November 1787 he was promoted to Major and on 9 March 1789 he was promoted again to Oberstleutnant. In the war with Ottoman Turkey, he served with the 2nd Banat Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 11. On 24 July 1789, in an unnamed skirmish, he drove off a superior force of Turks by leading a flank attack. In May 1790, he led part of his regiment to the relief of the Lubina blockhouse, which was under assault by the Turks. At the end of the war, he transferred to the Brechainville Infantry Regiment Nr. 25. \n\n\n== Fighting the French ==\nIn 1792, Sporck became Oberst (colonel) in command of Grand Duke of Tuscany Infantry Regiment Nr. 23. He assumed command from Franz von Rottenburg and in 1794 would be succeeded by Anton Bürger. At the start of the War of the First Coalition the regiment was stationed in the Austrian Netherlands. On 23 April 1792, part of the regiment took part in a reconnaissance of Maubeuge. Two battalions of the regiment served during the Siege of Le Quesnoy from 28 August to 13 September 1793. On 1 January 1794, Sporck was promoted Generalmajor to rank from 17 December 1793. He fought at the Battle of Mouscron on 28–29 April 1794. In the aftermath of the Battle of Courtrai, at Ingelmunster on 12 May he led a brigade consisting of two battalions of the Sztáray Infantry Regiment Nr. 33, the 2nd Battalion of the Callenberg Infantry Regiment Nr. 54, and two guns.   \n\n \nSporck served in the Army of the Upper Rhine during the Rhine campaign of 1795. In early 1796, he was among the troops transferred to Italy. On 29 July 1796, the Austrian army commander Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser launched the first relief of the Siege of Mantua. Of the four relieving columns, Spork was assigned to lead a brigade in the I Column of Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich. The other three brigades were led by Joseph Ocskay, Peter Ott, and Prince Reuss. The two advanced guards were led by the Marquis of Lusignan and Johann von Klenau. Quasdanovich's column counted 15,272 infantry, 2,349 cavalry, and 24 position guns. Klenau captured Brescia by surprise on 30 July and his troops were soon joined by the brigades of Sporck and Reuss. The Battle of Lonato was an intricate series of actions fought on the west side of Lake Garda over the next few days in which Napoleon Bonaparte's French army made its main effort against Quasdanovich's column while holding back the rest of Wurmser's army. On the night of 3 August, Quasdanovich decided to attack Salò but both Ott and Sporck argued against it on the grounds that their troops were low on ammunition and food. Reuss soon arrived with the news that Ocskay's brigade had been destroyed. Quasdanovich elected to withdraw from the area after hearing no news of Wurmser and seeing I Column reduced to only 10,000 troops. \nAt the end of August 1796, Wurmser reorganized his army for the second relief of Mantua. He appointed Paul Davidovich to lead a corps that would defend the Tyrol while Wurmser marched to Bassano via the Valsugana. Davidovich's corps numbered 19,555 men of which the brigades of Sporck and Josef Philipp Vukassovich counted 7,840 infantry and 626 cavalry. Unexpectedly, the French attacked these two brigades with overwhelming force in the Battle of Rovereto in the morning of 4 September, driving them back after a hard combat. Davidovich assigned the 1,700 men of Preiss Infantry Regiment Nr. 24 to hold a narrow defile north of Rovereto. Thinking that they were protected, the 4,800 remaining soldiers of Sporck and Vukassovich bivouacked and began to cook dinner. However, the French rapidly overran the Preiss Regiment and at 4:00 pm charged into the camp without warning, routing both brigades. By the next day, 75% of Sporck's men were casualties or dispersed and 1,000 of Vukassovich's soldiers were casualties.\n\nJózsef Alvinczi was selected as the Austrian army commander for the third relief of Mantua. The plans for the operation were drawn up by Sporck and Franz von Weyrother. They called for Davidovich's corps to advance south through the mountains while Alvinczi's main army moved east to Verona via Bassano. At the start of the operation, Davidovich's corps numbered 18,427 infantry and 1,049 cavalry. This significantly outnumbered the 10,500-strong French division opposed to it. Davidovich's corps was divided into six brigade-sized columns, of which the III Column was led by Sporck and included 2,560 infantry. Davidovich defeated the French at the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November 1796, though the victorious Austrians suffered 3,567 casualties. After defeating Alvinczi at the Battle of Arcole, Bonaparte turned on Davidovich and forced his corps to retreat. The third relief was beaten back by a very narrow margin. \nOn 1 March 1797, Sporck was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant to rank from 28 February 1797. He served under Archduke Charles in the spring 1797 campaign. From March 1798 to January 1799, he commanded the autonomous corps in the Tyrol. In 1800, he commanded a division in the army of Paul Kray. On 3 May 1800, he fought in the Battles of Stockach and Engen. Sporck was subordinate to Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont who was tasked to defend Stockach against Claude Lecourbe's French corps. While the main armies fought to a draw at Engen, Lecourbe's 20,000 Frenchmen evicted Vaudémont's 12,000 Austrians from Stockach. In the Battle of Messkirch on 5 May, Sporck still fought under Vaudémont. In the Battle of Iller River (or Battle of Erolzheim) on 5 June, Sporck commanded the reserve and was captured by the French when he rode ahead on a personal reconnaissance.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nIn 1801, Sporck was appointed inhaber of Infantry Regiment Nr. 25. The previous incumbent was Ludwig Brechainville and the regiment's next inhaber would be Franz Julius Zedtwitz. In 1802 Sporck was appointed Grand Master of the Household to Archduke Anton Victor of Austria. He died in Vienna on 10 February 1806. \n\n\n== Notes ==\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== References ==\nArnold, James R. (2005). Marengo & Hohenlinden: Napoleon's Rise to Power.

        "content": "Xenobalanus globicipitis is a species of pseudo-stalked barnacle. It's frequently spotted on the appendages of at least 34 species of cetaceans, commonly baleen whales and bottlenose dolphins. This species is not technically a true stalked barnacle, hence the 'pseudo' in its name.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe creature is dark in coloration and up to 5 cm (2.0 in) long. It hangs from tails, dorsal fins, flippers, and less commonly rostrums and baleen plates/teeth. In a sample population of the dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba, by far the most frequent site of occurrence were the flukes. This animal is native to tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters around the world. It can cluster in various amounts, from one to one hundred, depending on the size and the animal and where on it they've adhered. These creatures are \"sessile\" — once they latch on with the shell base, they don't move off unless they need to (for example, if the water gets too cold for them). They burrow themselves into the skin and blubber of their host, though they are not technically parasitic and instead engage in phoresis.\n\n\n== Feeding ==\nX. globicipitis takes advantage of the migratory movements of marine mammals, using their motion and location to feed on plankton without having to do the locomotion themselves. It feeds through suspension techniques.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was a candidate for Mayor of Split in 2013 and 2017.\nShe served as president of Pametno from its foundation in 2013. After Pametno merged with Party with a First and Last Name (IP) and became the Centre, Puljak became one of the four co-leaders of the new party, together with Dalija Orešković, Marin Račić and Dario Carev. Orešković and Puljak were elected to the Croatian Parliament in the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election, as leading candidates of the Pametno - IP - Focus coalition.\nShe is married to Ivica Puljak, a physicist serving as the incumbent Mayor of Split and president of Centre.

        "content": "The War in Jebel Akhdar refers to the fighting between Italian soldiers and Senussi rebels near the forested and mountainous areas of the Jebel Akhdar. The attacks by the Italians were initially met by strong guerrilla resistance, but this resistance soon fell as the Battle of Uadi Bu Taga took place. This conflict resulted in the execution of the main Senussi leaders and, subsequently, the end of the Italian pacification campaign.\n\n\n== Course of the War ==\nIn 1923, the fascist government of Benito Mussolini ordered generals Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio to occupy the Jebel Akhdar area, building fortifications guarded by Savaris. However, these positions where threatened by the Lion of the Desert and his army, who used guerrilla tactics to fight back the Colonials. During this campaign, 100,000 Bedouins, half of the population of the entire region of Cyrenaica, were deported to various barbed-wire concentration camps, most of them in Benghazi. Due to this, Italian Generals and Omar Mukhtar tried to negotiate the course of the war, but none of the sides agreed and because of that, Italy began to plan the full conquest of Libya. In a carefully prepared and coordinated operation with ten differently composed columns, Graziani tried from 16 June 1930, to encircle and destroy the units of Omar Mukhtar. However, the Senussi combat units were prepared for battle as they were again informed by the local population and by deserters from Italian colonial troops and, by dividing themselves into smaller groups of units, they managed to escape the encirclement by the Italian columns but with very heavy losses.: 71  On 9 September 1931, Graziani started another offensive this time towards Slonta and Cyrene and this one was a success: the leader of the rebellion, Omar al-Mukhtar, was wounded and then captured in battle, ending definitely the War in Jebel Akhdar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Old Town Hall is a former municipal building in the High Street in Epping, Essex, a town in England. The building, which briefly served as the headquarters of Epping Urban District Council, now accommodates a firm of estate agents.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-19th century, a group of local businessmen decided to form a company, to be known as the Epping Town Hall Company, to finance and commission a town hall for the town. The new building was designed in the Italianate style, built in red brick at a cost of about £1,700 and was completed in 1863. The site they selected was on the southeast side of the High Street.\nThe design involved a single-storey entrance block of three bays, facing onto the High Street, and a full-height main block with a gable stretching back behind the entrance block. The first two bays of the entrance block were fenestrated by segmental headed sash windows, while the right-hand bay featured a round-headed doorway flanked by a pair Doric order pilasters supporting an architrave and a keystone. Internally, the principal room was the main assembly hall, which could seat 500 people and was used for a variety of meetings, concerts, and other public events.\nAfter the Epping Union and Rural Sanitary Authority was succeeded by Epping Urban District Council in 1896, the council decided to use the town hall as its offices and meeting place.  However, the company that had developed the town hall got into financial difficulties and the council had to use temporary facilities for its meetings, before relocating to Hawthorn Lodge on the opposite side of the High Street.\nIn 1912, the building was sold for alternative use and was converted into the Picture House cinema, seating 419 people.  A large hoarding was erected on the roof of the entrance block advertising the latest film available for viewing. The company which had developed the town hall was then dissolved in May 1915. By the early 1920s, the cinema was part of the Shipman & King circuit, and in 1924 it was renamed the Picture Palace.  In 1935, it suffered a major fire, but was rebuilt and reopened the following year as the Empire Cinema.  The cinema closed in 1954, and the facade was rebuilt with a modern shopfront allowing the building to become a Tesco supermarket. The entrance building was occupied by a photography shop, \"The Portrait Studio\",  in the early 21st century, then by an education centre for young people known as \"The Box\" from around 2010, and then by a firm of estate agents, Mullucks, from about 2015. Offices were installed in the former assembly hall.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fryderyk Smelting Works (German: Friedrichshütte), officially Royal Fryderyk Smelting Works (German: Königliche Friedrichshütte) was a silver and lead smelting plant operating from 1786 to 1933 located in Upper Silesia in Strzybnica (since 1975 a district of Tarnowskie Góry).\nIt was founded on the initiative of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, who made significant contributions to the industrial development of Upper Silesia. It was named after the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great. The plant processed ores from the Royal Fryderyk Mine (German: Königliche Friedrichsgrube) in Bobrowniki Śląskie (nowadays the Historic Silver Mine in Tarnowskie Góry). It gave rise to a new settlement – Strzybnica (German: Friedrichshütte) – built for the plant's workers. In 1922, it was taken over by the Second Polish Republic and hosted dignitaries such as Marshal Józef Piłsudski and President Stanisław Wojciechowski. In 1937, after over 150 years of operation, the plant was closed. Soon after World War II, the area was taken over by the Strzybnica Metal Works, later renamed the Zamet Mechanical Works in Tarnowskie Góry in 1976.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe area of the former Fryderyk Smelting Works (formerly the Zamet Mechanical Works, currently Zamet Budowa Maszyn S.A.) is located in the north-western district of Tarnowskie Góry – Strzybnica – between Zagórska Street (part of National Road 11), Father Edward Płonka Street (formerly Metalowców Street), Kościelna Street, and – until 22 December 2016 – Zametowska Street. Nearby runs railway line No. 144, which connects Tarnowskie Góry station with Opole Główne station and until April 2018 had an industrial spur leading to the plant.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From 1786 to 1862 ===\nThe silver and lead smelting plant at the site of the former Donnersmarcks' hammer mill in Piaseczna (German: Piassetzna) near Tarnowskie Góry (German: Tarnowitz) was built by the Prussian government on the initiative of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden in just six months in 1786. The construction was overseen by Johann Friedrich Wedding, brought to Silesia by Reden. Smelting of ore in two blast furnaces began on 27 September 1786, using water from the drainage canal of the Boże Wspomóż adit (German: Gotthelf), while the ore was supplied from the Royal Fryderyk Mine (German: Königliche Friedrichsgrube) in Bobrowniki Śląskie. Initially, charcoal was used as fuel, which was gradually replaced with coke produced on-site from around 1790 to reduce production costs and achieve higher temperatures. In the 1830s, black coal was also introduced for flaming.\nDuring the initial period of operation, the smelter produced 32,384 kg of silver, 28,050 tons of lead, and 30,142 tons of lead monoxide.\nIn 1799, the smelter employed almost a hundred workers. By the end of this period, with the expansion of the plant to include 6 coke-fired furnaces and a blowing engine powered by a steam engine with a capacity of 16 horsepower (in 1858), employment increased to 180 people.\n\n\n=== From 1863 to 1886 ===\nDuring the second stage of operation, the Fryderyk Smelting Works became independent. A royal smelting office (German: Kgl. Hüttenamt zu Friedrichshütte) was established there. Previously, it was supervised by the Royal Upper Silesian Mining Office in Tarnowskie Góry.\nThe beginning of this period saw increased ore deliveries from the Royal Fryderyk Mine and smaller private mines. This necessitated the expansion of the plant and modernization of production technology. A new method of silvering lead was introduced, allowing for increased lead production at the expense of lead monoxide. Additionally, in 1868, a zinc distillation furnace was built, enabling the production of pure zinc from the slag produced during ore smelting. The number of furnaces increased to 11. From 1867 to 1886, lead production increased from 3,596 to 15,061 tons (319%), while lead monoxide production increased from 827 to 1,697 tons (105%).\nEmployment also increased during this period, with the number of employees fluctuating as follows:\n\nThe employees of the smelter were mainly residents of nearby villages such as Rybna, Stare Tarnowice, and Piaseczna, for whom 13 houses and a vocational school were built. This marked the beginning of a new town, which took its name directly from the smelter – Friedrichshütte or Friedrichshütte O.S., where O.S. stood for Oberschlesien – Upper Silesia. In 1886, the construction of an Evangelical-Augsburg church was completed, followed by a Catholic church a year later. Today, this area is a district of Tarnowskie Góry called Strzybnica.\nIn total, between 1786 and 1886 (over 100 years), the Fryderyk Smelting Works produced 167,556 kg of silver, 178,011 tons of lead, and 52,726 tons of lead monoxide, with a total value of 106,358,076 Deutsche Marks. From 1865, lead was exported to Austria and Russia, and from 1865 to 1877, also to America.\n\n\n=== From 1887 to 1933 ===\nDuring this period, there was a peak in the modernization of furnace constructions, allowing for the roasting of poorer ores and the separation of sulfur from them, which enabled the start of sulfuric acid production in 1900. The plant was expanded again between 1900 and 1909, employment increased (to 640 people in 1910), and the equipment was electrified.\nNumerous processing plants were established in the vicinity of the smelter, including a factory for lead shot and sheet metal (owned by Giesches Erben since 1887), and a lead products factory founded in 1895 directly adjacent to the Fryderyk Smelting Works, owned by Bleiindustrie-Aktiengesellschaft vorm. Jung & Lindig from Freiberg in Saxony.\nDuring the Third Silesian Uprising, supervision of the smelter was taken over by a representative of the Polish plebiscite committee. On 22 June 1922, the plant was officially taken over by the Polish treasury, becoming a state-owned enterprise. On August 26 of the same year, Chief of State Józef Piłsudski visited the plant and personally poured the first block of silver in the Polish smelter. On 16 March 1923, under the name Polish Treasure Lead and Silver Smelting Works in Strzybnica (Upper Silesia) Leased Company Tarnowskie Góry SA (abbreviated as Tarnoferme), the company was transferred to a corporation, half of the capital of which belonged to the treasury, and the other half to private French capital (Mineraux et Métaux Paris). As a result, there was a limitation on the supremacy of state authorities over the smelter and practically no possibility of interference in the rights of the owners. A month after the establishment of the leased company, President of Poland Stanisław Wojciechowski visited the smelter.\nAround 1927, the workforce numbered approximately 500 employees. In 1925, the smelter in Strzybnica produced 2,100 tons of lead, 850 tons of lead monoxide, and 1,500 kg of silver. Every year, about 6,000 tons of sulfuric acid were also produced. By 1932, this had decreased to only 1,500 tons of lead, 630 tons of lead monoxide, and 1,000 kg of silver. This was due to the loss, after the division of Upper Silesia to Germany, of the western mining area of the Fryderyk mine; until 1922, over 3,000 tons of ore from this mine were smelted, but from 1922, it was only 500 tons.\nAround 1927, the management of the smelter included engineer Clemens Mülkay and former Minister of Internal Affairs Antoni Kamieński. On 15 February 1932, the decision was made to close the plant, and on 21 April 1933, the liquidation of the Tarnoferme company began. The slag accumulated around the plant and the remnants of ores from the mining areas of Brzozowice, Cecylia, and Nowa Helena were purchased by the Giesche company. The liquidation of the plant was completed on 25 July 1937.\nAmong the reasons for the closure of the smelter were:\n\nThe aforementioned loss of the western mining area of the Fryderyk mine, which reduced the amount of smelted own ore;\nthe increase in production costs due to the necessity of importing lead ores from Australia, Germany, and Romania, among others, and the difficulties in processing ore of various origins;\nthe depletion of lead deposits in its own mining field Fryderyk;\nthe declining demand for lead and the decrease in its prices on world markets caused by the Great Depression.\n\n\n=== After liquidation ===\nIndustrial activity on the site of the former lead and silver smelter was reactivated in 1946. A cast iron foundry, a pattern shop, and design and mechanical departments were launched. New machines were installed in the halls, while the original furnaces from the late 18th century were mindlessly destroyed. In 1949, a company called Strzybnica Metal Works was established, supervised by the Central Management of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry in Katowice. A year later, the name of the plant was changed to Processing Plant Strzybnica. Between 1953 and 1954, a project to expand the plant with a steel casting foundry and a machine park was implemented.\nOn 1 April 1961, as a result of the merger of the Strzybnica plant with the Mechanical and Assembly Plant of Non-Ferrous Ore Mining in Piekary Śląskie, the Mechanical Plant of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Zamet was established in Strzybnica.\nIn 1964, a new mechanical processing department was put into operation, and in 1966, iron foundry and prototype departments were established. Additionally, electric and experimental production plants were created. In 1971, the design department was expanded. During this period, production of machinery, equipment, steel structures, parts, and components for plants belonging to the Non-Ferrous Metals Mining and Metallurgical Union in Katowice was launched. This included, among other things, reinforcements and shaft cages, overburden and underburden devices, buckets and mine carts, and conveyor belts for mining, flotation machines, and pumps for ore enrichment plants, coolers and pipelines for chemical plants, electrolytic tanks, foundry machines, and equipment for zinc rectification for smelters, as well as equipment for plastic processing of non-ferrous metals. Armament production was also started between 1977 and 1979. In 1975, gear machining nests and a heat treatment department were launched. A year later, after the merger of the town of Strzybnica with the city of Tarnowskie Góry, the name of the plant was changed to Mechanical Plant Zamet in Tarnowskie Góry.\nFrom 1974 to 1980, the management of Zamet supported the reconstruction of the Warkoczów Palace in Rybna, sponsored housing development from 1981 to 1982, and built a holiday resort for plant employees near the reservoir in Pniowiec.\nIn 1986, machine exports began to countries including Yugoslavia, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, the USSR, Romania, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. Celebrations were also held to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the start of the smelting activity at Zamet by the Fryderyk Smelting Works. On 5 July 1988, the first secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Manfred Gorywoda, made an economic visit to the plant.\nTo enhance the quality of production, Zamet cooperated with institutions such as the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, the AGH University of Krakow, the Institute of Iron Metallurgy, and the Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals, as well as design offices: Hutmaszprojekt, Biprohut, and Bipromet.\nWith the beginning of the 1990s, Zamet became part of the Famur Group as ZAMET Construction Machinery S.A. In 2004, the subsidiary in Bytom was incorporated into the company – a unit created based on the mechanical department of the former Zygmunt Iron Works.\nIn 2010, the plant was acquired by Pioma Industry S.A. from Piotrków Trybunalski. The transaction was worth 85 million PLN and resulted in the change of name to Zamet Industry Joint Stock Company. In 2013, ZAMET Construction Machinery S.A., Zamet Industry Joint Stock Company, and Mostostal Chojnice jointly formed the ZAMET Group.\n\n\n== Production from 1787 to 1932 ==\nThe table below shows the production at the Fryderyk Smelting Works from 1787 to 1932.

        "content": "The Russian submarine Tyulen (Russian: Тюлень, lit. 'seal') was the third and last boat in the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was laid down in August 1913 and was launched in November 1913, though it did not enter service until March 1915. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, it saw action during World War I and became the most successful Russian submarine in the Black Sea, credited with sinking over 40 ships for a total tonnage of 8,973 gross register tons (GRT). It was also the second most successful Russian submarine in the war overall, after Volk.\nIn early 1915, Tyulen made several failed attempts to sink the German cruisers in the Black Sea, Goeben and Breslau. After that it focused on Ottoman merchant shipping, which transported coal to Constantinople from other parts of Anatolia, and sank many sailing ships and schooners. In July 1916 the submarine entered the Gulf of Varna to carry out reconnaissance on the Bulgarian naval base there, and in October, some of its crewmen boarded and captured a Turkish transport ship before bringing it back with them to Sevastopol. In May 1918, the German Army advanced into Crimea and took control of much of the Black Sea Fleet, including Tyulen. The British later acquired the submarine after Germany's surrender, and gave it to the White Army forces in September 1919. Tyulen was among Wrangel's fleet of ships that evacuated from Crimea in late 1920 during the Russian Civil War, and ended up in French Tunisia, where the submarine was eventually sold for scrap in 1930.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval-class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, and Tyulen differed from the others by having two deck guns instead of one, along with four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1⁄2 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150 ft; 46 m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140-horsepower (850 kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190 kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30 km/h; 18 mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22 km/h; 14 mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three Morzh-class boats began on 25 June 1911, and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was specifically founded to build the Morzh class. In November 1913 Tyulen became the third and last of this class to be launched.\nThe engines and electric battery were installed in January 1915, with sea trials taking place until March 1915, which was when Tyulen entered service with the Imperial Black Sea Fleet. The Morzh-class boats were considered the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet when they were completed.\n\n\n== World War I service ==\n\n\n=== 1915 ===\n\nWhen it joined the fleet, Tyulen was commanded by Senior Lieutenant Pyotr S. Bachmanov. The Black Sea Fleet spent the first months of the war in 1914 on the defensive, but in early 1915 this changed when the Stavka ordered its commander to attack the Bosporus and Constantinople in support of the French and the British Gallipoli campaign. The submarine's first mission in the spring of 1915 was patrolling the waters between the Bosphorus and Zonguldak, a coal-producing region of the Ottoman Empire. While on its third patrol, on 28 April 1915, Tyulen unsuccessfully tried to attack the German cruiser Goeben. From 7 to 15 May the submarine was on its fourth patrol, and it fired torpedoes at the cruiser Breslau near Zonguldak, though it was spotted before its attack and the torpedoes missed. Another failed attempt was made by Tyulen to attack Breslau on 28 May 1915, during its fifth patrol.\nIn the summer, Tyulen began focusing on transport ships, and on 14 June sank the Turkish coal transport Erdek. This was followed by the sinking of another coal transport, Taif, on 15 June, and more ships over the next several days. That patrol in June led to the sinking of nine Turkish ships by the Russian submarine. For the remainder of the year, Tyulen continued destroying Turkish transports, schooners, and other ships. On 10 August 1915, while on patrol together with its sister ship, the submarine Morzh, they raided an Ottoman convoy escorted by the cruisers Goeben and Hamidiye. In that attack, Tyulen sank a 1,545-ton coal transport. Senior Lieutenant Mikhail A. Kititsyn became the submarine's commanding officer in September 1915, and sank five ships over the next several months, for which he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna, 3rd and 4th classes, and the Order of Saint Stanislaus with swords. The Russian naval campaign in 1915 did not have any significant impact on the fighting in Gallipoli, but attacks on coal transports did undermine the Ottoman Empire's war effort, causing the German commanding admiral in the region, Wilhelm Souchon, to limit the actions of his ships to save fuel. But after Bulgaria entered the war, these losses were partly made up for by shipping coal overland from Germany.\n\n\n=== 1916–17 ===\n\nThe campaign against merchant shipping continued, and the submarine's commander, Kititsyn, increasingly began attacking while on the surface using artillery guns and ramming to destroy Turkish schooners. On a mission off the Bulgarian coast in May 1916, Tyulen destroyed four Turkish schooners escorting a coal ship using artillery, then captured and towed the transport to Sevastopol. Another vessel was captured in July 1916. Also that month, the submarine was able to enter the Gulf of Varna, the site of a Bulgarian naval base used by German U-boats, to chart the bay and its defenses. The crew of Tyulen spent 17 hours submerged, and Kititsyn later recalled that the air quality became so bad that it caused headaches for the crew from the higher levels of carbon dioxide. But the operation was a success, with Tyulen being able to accomplish its objectives without being seen or entering minefields. Its crew and captain were awarded decorations for the mission, and the information they gathered on the Varna naval base was used by the Black Sea Fleet to launch an air raid on it in late August 1916, using planes from three seaplane tenders, while the battleship Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya and seven destroyers provided security.\nTyulen and the other Russian submarines in the Black Sea continued disrupting the shipping of coal from Anatolia to Constantinople for the rest of 1916. The most famous incident involving Tyulen took place on 11 October 1916, while it was on patrol near the Bosporus. Tyulen came across the 6,000-ton Turkish steamer Rodosto, and the submarine commander decided to capture the ship. The submarine began to approach, resulting in an artillery fight. None of the shells fired by the steamer could hit Tyulen, which fired back and scored hits, causing a fire to break out on board. Later the captain sent a team of crewmen and officers to board the steamer, where they took prisoner several German and Turkish crew members, including the German captain. The captured Turkish transport ship was brought back by the submarine to Sevastopol, and the entire crew of Tyulen were awarded the Cross of St. George for the achievement.\nBy early 1917, German and Ottoman naval activity in the Black Sea had been greatly reduced, and the main focus of the Black Sea Fleet became planning for naval landings in the Bosporus. The crews of the Black Sea Fleet were affected by the Russian Revolution, but to a lesser degree than the Baltic Fleet, and it remained active in combat operations. Under the Russian Provisional Government, the Black Sea Fleet continued to mount attacks along the Turkish coast for months after the February Revolution, and Tyulen destroyed several more ships that year. The outbreak of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks agreeing to an armistice with the Central Powers in December 1917 ended Russian naval activity.\nUnder the command of Mikhail Kititsyn, who was promoted to Captain 2nd rank, the submarine Tyulen was credited with sinking over 40 enemy ships and capturing several, making it the highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea. One estimate put the tonnage sunk by Tyulen at 8,973 gross register tons (GRT), which was the second most in the Russian Navy during the war, only behind Captain 1st rank Ivan Messer and his boat in the Baltic Sea, the submarine Volk.\n\n\n== Russian Civil War and fate ==\nAfter the armistice, the German Army advanced all the way to Crimea, and in May 1918 Tyulen was captured in Sevastopol by the Germans along with a large part of the Black Sea Fleet. The Germans intended to put some submarines and other captured ships to use, but they only commissioned one battleship into the German Navy before the war ended in November 1918. The submarine was then acquired by the British, who gave it to the White Russian movement in September 1919. Tyulen became part of the Armed Forces of South Russia, before joining Wrangel's Black Sea fleet. The fleet evacuated from Crimea in 1920 when the Bolsheviks reached it, and ended up seeking protection from France before being sent to the French Tunisian port of Bizerte.\nTyulen and the Russian fleet went to Tunisia at the end of December 1920, arriving at Bizerte. The St Andrew's flag, the naval ensign of the Imperial Russian Navy, was removed from the boat in October 1924. The submarine was sold for scrap by France in 1930.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works ===",

        "content": "Yellow River management , Yellow River governance or Yellow River engineering (Simplified Chinese: 黄河治理, Traditional Chinese: 黃河治理) involves constructing hydraulic engineering projects to prevent flood disasters caused by the Yellow River and to harness its water resources. The river, flowing through the Loess Plateau, has been notorious since ancient times for its high sediment content and its propensity to flood and change course. Simple construction of riverbanks to prevent flooding would lead to sediment accumulation, creating an elevated river in downstream areas.\nThe management of the Yellow River has been a perennial challenge for Chinese rulers throughout history. The flooding of the Yellow River often signifies large-scale displacement and dynastic changes. The saying \"a sage emerges when the Yellow River is clear (聖人出黃河清) \" illustrates that effective management of the Yellow River is closely linked to the legitimacy, effectiveness, and stability of Chinese regimes.\n\n\n== History ==\nLegend has it that the Xia dynasty was founded by Yu the Great, who organized efforts to control water. The origin of Chinese nation is closely tied to the management of the Yellow River.\nAfter Qin Shi Huang unified the Six States, he initiated large-scale hydraulic constructions, including dredging of the river channels. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han of Han, the renowned water management expert Zheng Guo expanded the scale of the projects, constructing the Zhengguo Canal, and systematized the management of the Yellow River even further.\nDuring the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty periods, the focus of Yellow River management was on strengthening the levees and dredging the river channels.\nIn the Ming Dynasty, Pan Jixun employed the method of \"binding water to expel sand\" and integrated management of the Yellow and Huai Rivers.\nAfter the 1950s, the People's Republic of China started tree planting on the Loess Plateau to stabilize the sand and built reservoirs such as the Xiaolangdi Dam. By using annual concentrated flood discharge and sediment transport management, they aimed to deepen the downstream riverbed of the Yellow River for long-term management.\n\n\n== References ==",

She majored in mechanical engineering at the Ohio State University, graduating in 1984. She completed a PhD in geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in 1990; her doctoral research involved Earth-based observation of Mars, supervised by Thomas B. McCord.\nShe came to JPL for postdoctoral research as a National Research Council Research Associate in 1990. Initially, she intended to work on a spectrometer for the Mars Observer, but after that instrument was cancelled she quickly switched to other projects involving unmanned landers on Mars and comets, eventually including the Chemistry and Camera complex of the Mars rover missions. She has remained at JPL as a scientist since 1992, and is Deputy Project Scientist for the Mars Exploration Rover project.\nShe chaired the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society for the 2021–2022 term.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiana Blaney publications indexed by Google Scholar\nA scientific legacy with Dr. Blaney (podcast), Spacepod, August 20, 2023",

He followed his father, Leonard Voeller, in government service. By letters patent of 15 March 1656, Governor General Archduke Leopold Wilhelm appointed him deputy secretary for German letters, under his father, with assurances that he would succeed to his father's office. After his father's retirement in 1675, he became secretary of state in his own right. On 18 September 1676, in Nijmegen, he married Marie-Elisabeth Creft (died 13 May 1691). They had a daughter, Jeanne Wendeline.\nAfter the Battle of Ramillies, Voeller gave his support to the Grand Alliance. He died in Brussels on 3 May 1710 and was buried in the family vault in the Chapel Church.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\n== L Train Brass Band ==\n\nThe L Train Brass Band is a large non-profit community adult music organization based in Brooklyn, NY. Founded in 2017, the L Train Brass Band is composed of close to 100 brass, reed, and percussion musicians based in New York City. The band plays Mardi Gras/New Orleans music in addition to rhythm and blues, hip-hop, and pop covers, as well as a handful of original songs. They are currently artists in residence at Culture Lab LIC.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe L Train Brass Band was founded in 2017 by Ryan Hall and David Joseph. The band was named after the L subway line that many early members utilized to travel to and from rehearsal. When the band became too large to rehearse in a basement, they moved outside, which prompted locals to invite them to increasingly larger events. They made their first large public appearance in June 2017 when they marched in the Coney Island Mermaid Parade.\n\n\n=== Notable Appearances and Events ===\nThe L Train Brass Band has performed at many high-profile events, including the Governors Ball Music Festival and the Debt Gala, a Met Gala alternative raising money to reduce debt. The group has made several trips to New Orleans, Louisiana, where they have performed as part of the Krewedelusion and Krewe Boheme parades. They have appeared in every Coney Island Mermaid Parade since 2017, where they have won several awards  and have been cited as a parade favorite. The band appears in the 2022 Apple TV Documentary \"End of the Line.\"\nThe L Train Brass Band has run and operated a New York City-based brass music festival called Brasswick since 2019. The event provides the community access to a variety of local bands and vendors.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Soumaine Ndodeba alias Tarzan is a Central African warlord from Vakaga.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nOriginally from Tiringoulou and a Gula, Ndodeba began his career as a guard for the Northern Region Development Program (PDRN) in 1997. When he worked as a guard, he gained military and tracking training from French, Swiss, American, and British trainers. From 2004 to 2007, he joined the elite private anti-poaching guard and conducted operations against hunters and herders. The guard was led by two Russians and ex-Foreign Legionnaires who dwelled at the Sangba base. He received a salary from a charity organization named the Association for the Protection of Central African Wildlife. While working at the elite guard, Russians gave Ndodeba the nickname Tarzan.\n\n\n=== Rebellion ===\nIn April 2006, an unknown airplane landed at Tiringoulou airstrip, prompting the government to send Presidential Guard to the town, and they attacked the residents as well as burned houses. After the attack, Ndodeba returned to Tiringoulou to check on his family. However, he fled to the bush. In the bush, he found his colleagues who planned the uprising against the government. Soon after, he trained military skills to his companions in the bush. From there, he earned the title of colonel.\nNdodeba joined UFDR because he felt dismayed by the Ministry of Water and Forest's decision to choose only the trackers from Bangui and the surrounding area. He and his group launched an attack in Birao at the end of October 2006 and managed to seize the weapons from the government forces.\nNdodeba returned to his hometown, and an American medical charity appointed him as the local children's rights advocate. Apart from that, they trained him to be a football coach. As the government signed peace agreements with UFDR, he wanted to participate in the DDR program, hoping that he would receive training and money and be employed at government institutions. However, the program ended up in vain.\nIn December 2012, Ndodeba joined Seleka. As the Seleka tried to enter Bangui, he was shot and flown to Gabon for further medical treatment. He was then released from the hospital and returned to Tiringoulou for recovery. Afterward, he went to Bambari and joined RPRC. As he joined RPRC, his rank was promoted from colonel to general, and he became one of the group's important military leaders. He was designated as RPRC leader in Bambari. On 24 February 2017, he left Bambari due to the MINUSCA intervention that wanted to prevent the UPC-RPRC clash.  He later left RPRC and joined PRNC in 2019.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLombard, Louisa (2020). Hunting Game: Raiding Politics in the Central African Republic.

        "content": "Dornach is one of the main affluent residential districts of Mulhouse intra muros, bordering Morschwiller-le-Bas and Lutterbach. It is an ancient settlement that owes its name to the Celts, a name that the Romans later Latinized into Durnacum and Germanized into Dornach. Dornach was once an autonomous commune, and for a long time served as a border village between the independent Republic of Mulhouse and Upper Alsace (of which it was a part), which was alternately under French and German rule. As such, it was home to the local Jewish and Catholic bourgeoisie, who could not stay in the territory of the Republic of Mulhouse due to the adoption of the exclusive Calvinist religion.\nIn 1908, under the German Empire, the town, whose population had grown strongly in the 19th century thanks to industrial development, asked to be merged with Mulhouse, as it couldn't solve the problems associated with urban development. The merger took effect in 1914, the year the district was the scene of the Battle of Dornach. The former Dornach industrial district of Brustlein became a fully-fledged Mulhouse district, while the Daguerre district, previously located in both communes, was unified, and the City of Mulhouse used the undeveloped parts of the commune to build the Haut-Poirier district (Illberg and Bel Air) and the Coteaux district. The former village area the west of the Strasbourg → Basel railroad line, located between the Dornach fairgrounds and the commune of Lutterbach, became the Mulhouse district of Dornach, which took on its current boundaries.\nAt the start of the 21st century, Dornach retains its village-style urban layout, making it an attractive residential area. The proximity of a large peripheral shopping area, two university campuses and two business parks, combined with motorway and rail links (Zu-Rhein, Mulhouse-Dornach and Musées stations) and the presence of the tramway (Line 3, Mulhouse Vallée de la Thur tram-train) further enhance this appeal. The late 20th and early 21st centuries were marked by the development of the ever-expanding Mulhouse Technology Crescent to the north, south, and west of the district.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Dornach district lies to the west of Mulhouse. A tributary of the Dollar River, the Steinbaechlein, runs through the district, having been canalized in the 19th century when the area was industrialized.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe district is served by the Mulhouse-Dornach train station and by public transport in the Mulhouse area.\n\n\n=== Neighboring towns and districts ===\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nAlsatian: Durni. Derived from Turnach (1250) from the Gallo-Roman etymon Turnacum, meaning “where there is a rise in the ground”. This word has the same etymology as Tournay and Tournai (Doornik) in Belgium.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nEvidence of Dornach's occupation dates back to the Neolithic period, with carved flints and axes discovered at the foot of the Illberg. Remains from the Hallstatt and La Tène periods include tombs, Vilannovian fibulae, Gallic coins, and other objects. The Romans Latinized the name Durnachos to Durnacum or Turnacum. During major invasions, the area was occupied by the Alamanni and Franks, who Germanized the name to Turnich, Durnich, Durnach, and finally Dornach.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the Middle Ages, the village of Dornach belonged to the abbey of Murbach, which gave it in fief to a noble family taking the name of Dornach.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, the de Dornach family died out. The sole heiress, Vérène, married Hertrich II Zu Rhein. The fiefdom of Dornach remained in the hands of the Zu Rheins until the French Revolution. The Thirty Years' War decimated the village, which fell from 200 inhabitants at the start of the conflict to 18 or 20 by the end of the war. When peace was signed, Dornach was repopulated.\n\n\n=== In the 19th century ===\n\nMulhouse's first industrialization soon had an impact on the village. It was in Dornach that the first steam engine was installed in 1812. Along the Steinbaechlein, textile factories set up shop: Blech-Fries, DollfusMieg et Cie, Hofer and Schlumberger, Thierry-Mieg au Brustlein. Louis René Villermé visits Dornach to write Tableau de l'état physique et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie, published in 1840. In it, he describes the working conditions of workers in the commune's factories.“In Mulhouse, in Dornach, work started at five in the morning and finished at five in the evening, summer and winter alike. [...] You have to see them arriving in town every morning and leaving every evening. Among them are a multitude of pale, skinny women, walking barefoot in the middle of the mud who, for want of umbrellas, wear their aprons or petticoats over their heads when it rains or snows, to protect their faces and necks, and a larger number of young children, no less dirty, no less pale, covered in rags, all greasy with the oil from the looms that falls on them while they work. The latter, better protected from the rain by the impermeability of their clothes, don't even carry on their arms, like the women just mentioned, a basket containing the day's provisions; but they do carry in their hands, or hide under their jackets as best they can, the morsel of bread that must feed them until the time they return home.”He also describes the workers' lodgings: “I saw in Mulhouse, Dornach and neighboring houses, miserable dwellings where two families each slept in a corner, on straw thrown on the floor and held together by two boards.... The misery in which the workers in the cotton industry in the Haut-Rhin department live is so profound that it produces the sad result that, while in the families of manufacturers, merchants, drapers, and factory managers, half of the children reach the age of twenty-one, this same half ceases to exist before the age of two in the families of weavers and cotton mill workers.\"\nAdolphe Braun's photographic company was founded in Dornach in 1853. It became an industrial establishment in 1862. Its reputation soon spread around the world, thanks to reproductions of works of art housed in the major museums of Europe. The population grew rapidly: 160 in 1764, 500 in 1789, 900 in 1813, 3,000 in 1851, 11,234 in 1913.\n\n\n=== In the 20th century ===\nOn August 19, 1914, Dornach, the new district of Mulhouse, was at the heart of one of the first battles of the World War I. On August 8, according to Plan XVII, French troops entered Mulhouse. But the city fell back into German hands two days later. Heavy fighting broke out in Illzach along the railway embankment. On August 18, French troops resume the offensive. The Germans and French were face to face in Dornach the following morning. The Battle of Dornach begins. The French artillery fired large numbers of shells into the houses of Dornach to support the advance of their infantry. By 5 p.m., French troops had taken possession of Mulhouse. Hundreds were killed and wounded on both sides. French troops abandoned Mulhouse on August 25, 1914. During the war, the Dornach chemical factories produced asphyxiating gas for German troops. They were bombed by French aircraft in November 19158. According to the newspaper Le Miroir, 42 workers, the plant manager, and a German colonel were asphyxiated by the gases they were producing9. Served by streetcar, train, and freeway and close to major industrial areas, Dornach nevertheless retained a “village-like” urban structure, making it an attractive residential area. From the end of the 20th century onwards, it became one of Mulhouse's two main middle-class neighborhoods, attracting mainly residents from wealthier socio-professional categories.\n\n\n== Religious communities ==\n\n\n=== The Jewish community ===\nUntil 1798, Jews were forbidden to live in Mulhouse. They settled in the surrounding communes, such as Dornach. In 1798, the city's Jewish community drew up a Memorbuch. It contained prayers in memory of the victims of persecution in Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Spain, Poland and Holland. In the 19th century, the community continued to grow. A new synagogue, now abandoned, was built in 1851 to plans by Jean-Baptiste Schacre, architect for the city of Mulhouse. A special feature of the Dornach synagogue is the existence of a small pit, located between the Almémor and the Holy Ark and filled in 1959. In June 1940, faced with the advance of the German army, many Jews fled Mulhouse and the Dornach district. The Nazis expelled those who remained in September.\n\n\n=== The Protestant community ===\nThe Dornach temple on rue Schoepflin is the place of worship for the Protestant Reformed community. The Protestant parish of Dornach includes Protestants from Dornach, Heimsbrunn, Lutterbach, Morschwiller-le-Bas, and Reiningue.\n\n\n=== The Catholic community ===\nThe Coteaux de l'Illberg parish community supports several Catholic churches in the area, including Saint Barthélemy Church in Rue du Château Zu-Rhein.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n== Major museums ==\nThe Cité du Train and the Musée Electropolis, two internationally renowned museums, are located in the north of the district. The former is Europe's largest railway museum, while the latter is Europe's largest museum of the history of electricity and household appliances.\nIn 1961, the city of Mulhouse donated land in Dornach to enable the SNCF to display rolling stock representative of its history. On October 14, 1969, the “Association du Musée Français du Chemin de Fer” was founded.\nIn 1992, the Electropolis Museum was created, thanks in part to EDF's sponsorship, to save the exhibition's centerpiece from destruction: a genuine working steam engine from 1901, coupled with a Sulzer-BBC alternator, a jewel in the crown of Mulhouse's technical and industrial heritage. It is 15 m long, weighs 170 tonnes of cast iron, steel, and copper, and has a 6 m diameter wheel. Between 1901 and 1947, it supplied 900 kilowatts of electricity at 400 volts to Mulhouse's historic D.M.C. industrial textile mill. A witness to the era of the first world's fairs, it took 20,000 hours of restoration work to get it up and running again every day for multimedia sound and light shows.\n\n\n== Parc de la Mer Rouge ==\nThe Parc de la Mer Rouge is a business park created in 1984, mainly for service sector companies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMulhouse\nSaint-Joseph Coal Mine\nMorschwiller-le-Bas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

Their bodies were found on May 2 at the bottom of a well.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRhoads and the Robinsons were on a surfing and camping trip together at the time of their deaths. Callum Robinson, aged 33, was a member of the Australian national Lacrosse team and a Stevenson University alumnus, who had lived in the US in an attempt to become a professional Lacrosse player. Jake Robinson, aged 30, was a doctor. All three travelled together in their jeep and posted photos of isolated beaches on social media.\nThey were camped near the town of Ensenada, which is located about 60 miles from Tijuana in Baja California. All three went missing on April 29. Suspicions arose after they did not check in to the Airbnb they booked in the resort town of Rosarito. The mother of the Robinsons said she had last heard from her sons on April 27.\n\n\n== Murder ==\nA burned-out white pickup truck was found in a ranch in Santo Tomas about 40 miles from where the bodies were found. Local police confirm that the truck is the same one Callumn posted on Instagram a week before the trio went missing.\nThe missing trio were found at a bottom of a well in a site that prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez describes as \"extremely hard to get to\". It took two hour to winch the bodies out. The three friends were later identified by their parents, without a need of a genetic test.\nThe initial investigation of local authorities suggest the trio were kidnapped and murdered by thieves that wanted their truck tires.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nAs the news of the killings spread out, it sparked outrage in the surf community of Ensenada, where about 500 people marched on Sunday to call for justice and better security.\n\n\n== References ==",

They started writing Swati with their names since then.\n\n\n==== Upper Pakhli ====\nIn Pakistan, Gibari Swatis inhabits the whole Upper Pakhli region of Hazara division and are considered as the most influential tribe in term of land ownership and politics.\nHazara Gazetteer mentions that Upper Pakhli region consists of the majority areas of Mansehra District and Battagram District and is known as Gibari Swati's country while the Lower Pakhli consisting of the rest two parts of these two districts are the country of Mitravi Swatis and Mamylai Swatis.\nPakhli is evidently named after Sultan Pakhal Gibari who conquered this area in late 1190s and it was reconquered again by same people in 1640s.\n\n\n== Sub-families ==\nGibari tribe of Swatis is divided into 3 main houses.\n1- Deshrais (Sultan Pakhal family)\n\nI-Jahangiris\nII-Arghushals\nIII-Malkals\nIV-Iznalis\nV-Mandravis\n2- Sarkhelis(Sultan Behram family)\n\nI- Lughmanis\nII- Dhodyaris\nIII- Laharis\nIV- Teetwals\nV- Khawaja Khelis\n3- Mirs\n\nI-Panjghols\nII-Panjmerals\nIII- Dodals\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nSultan Pakhal Gibari (Founder of Sultanate of Swat)\nPakhal II (Ruler from House of Pakhal)\nSultan Awais Swati  (Last king of Swat Sultanate)\nKhan Khudadad Khan Swati (1st Health Minister of Pakistan)\nBabar Saleem Swati (Speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province)\nAbdul Hakeem Khan Swati (13th Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)\n\n\n== References ==",

Leonard likewise began his career in Neuburg's service, but at some point transferred to the service of Isabella Clara Eugenia.\nOn 29 January 1629, he married Johanna Smidt in Cologne. The family lived in a house that he had bought in the Wolstraat in Brussels, where they had four children: Jean Herman, Martin, Charles Albert (who died young), and Marie Anne Agnès (who died on 21 February 1721).\nVoeller was sent to Spain in 1632 to accompany Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria on his planned journey to Brussels, which was completed only in 1634. On 17 June 1642 he was appointed secretary of state for German letters, responsible for the governor general's correspondence with princes and governments of the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia. In 1656, he received assurances that his son would be appointed in succession to him. He only retired in 1675.\nVoeller died in Brussels on 13 November 1675 and was buried in a tomb in the Chapel Church in that city. His epitaph recorded that he had held his office for thirty-three years, died in his eighties, and was buried alongside his wife.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Blau-Weiß Brühl (officially known as Fußballclub Blau-Weiß Brühl 1949 e.V.) was a football club from the town of Brühl in the Rhineland region of Germany. The club's first team participated in the DFB-Pokal in 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe football club was founded in 1949 and for many decades played at the district level. In 2000, the club achieved promotion to the district league for the first time, followed by a rapid ascent to the Landesliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein League). In 2001, under the guidance of coach Nissim Beniesch, Blau-Weiß Brühl reached the final of the Mittelrheinpokal (Mittelrhein Cup) and defeated the reserves of Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the process. On May 24, 2001, they won the final against Borussia Freialdenhoven with a score of 3–2. This made the team the first seventh-tier club to qualify for the DFB-Pokal 2001/02. In the DFB-Pokal, Blau-Weiß Brühl, now playing at the sixth-tier level due to their previous promotion, faced Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern and lost 1–4 after initially taking a 1–0 lead in front of approximately 6,000 spectators.\nSubsequently, Blau-Weiß Brühl achieved another promotion to the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein Association League) in the league competition. However, in the 2002/03 season, the team narrowly avoided relegation, and a year later, they finished in last place and were relegated back to the Landesliga. The merger of TuRa Hennef with FC Geistingen to form FC Hennef 05 prevented Brühl from being relegated to the Bezirksliga. Nonetheless, they were eventually relegated to that league in 2006 due to sporting reasons. With the absence of sporting success and further relegations to the Kreisliga A and Kreisliga B in 2008, Blau-Weiß Brühl also lost important players and officials.\nIn the 2008/09 season, the team was withdrawn from competitive play and the club was ultimately dissolved. This development was facilitated by the simultaneous success of local rivals SC Brühl 06/45, who achieved promotion to the fifth-tier Mittelrheinliga in 2008.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nWinner of the Middle Rhine Cup in 2001\n\n\n== Notable personalities ==\nFuat Kılıç\nWolodymyr Ljutyj\nMohamed Azima\n\n\n== References ==",

She is best known for co-founding the Lesbian Herstory Archives with Joan Nestle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDeborah Edel was born on June 23, 1944, to anthropologist May Mandelbaum Edel and philosopher Abraham Edel. She had one brother, Matthew, and after her mother's death in 1964, her father remarried philosopher Elizabeth Flower. Her uncle was writer and historian Leon Edel.\nIn the 1970s, Edel worked as a psychologist for children with learning disabilities at the Coney Island Hospital, and in 1985 began working at the Mary Macdowell Friends School in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn 1974, she and her partner, Joan Nestle, started the Lesbian Herstory Archives after being inspired by a women's consciousness raising group of the Gay Academic Union. The collections of the archive were first housed in an apartment shared by Edel and Nestle on the Upper West Side, and along with Judith Schwartz, they served as the first official coordinators of the archive. The collection was moved to a brownstone in Park Slope in 1993 after it became too large for the apartment.\nNestle and Edel gave a presentation on the Lesbian Herstory Archives at the controversial 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality.\n\n\n== References ==",

He completed his schooling in his hometown and Budapest. On Easter Sunday in 1880, against his parents' wishes, he became an actor in Csurgó, where Károly Szathmáry was the director at the time. His first role was Lajos in \"Falu rossza.\" After a short stint traveling in the countryside, he enrolled in the Academy of Drama, but only stayed for a year. In 1884, he moved to Kolozsvár, where he achieved great success as Ferdinand in \"Ármány és szerelem\" (Intrigue and Love), becoming a favorite of the renowned tragic actor, Gyula Ecsedi Kovács.

On March 9, 1911, in Szeged, he celebrated his 30-year artistic career with \"Othello.\" He worked in Szeged until 1914, then retired on July 25 of the same year in Gyula, with a performance in \"Lear király\" (King Lear). He served as a clerk at the Ministry of Agriculture for a long time. As a councilor of the Actors' Association, he contributed greatly to the cultural aspirations of provincial theater. He retired on September 1, 1914. He was laid to rest in the Kerepesi Cemetery, and his grave is now located in the Farkasréti Cemetery (Hv26.

Ukraine declared that it would not acknowledge Putin as the president of Russia. This will be the first full term served after the 2020 Russian constitutional amendments which established a hard two-term limit. It is expected that the government will resign as usual. The President addressed the citizens, and then, according to tradition, received the parade of the presidential regiment on the Kremlin’s Cathedral Square.\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by members of the government, the presidential administration, deputies of both chambers of parliament, judges of the Constitutional Court and members of the Central Election Commission.\n\n\n== Background ==\nVladimir Putin has served as President of the Russian Federation since 1999, with the exception of the period from 2008 to 2012, when the position was held by Dmitry Medvedev .\nAccording to official data, in the 2024 presidential elections, Vladimir Putin won with 87.28% of the votes.\n\n\n== Inauguration ==\nPutin arrived in the restyled Aurus Senat.\n\n\n== Foreign guests ==\nOn 6 May, Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov informed journalists during a press briefing that formal invitations had been extended to all foreign ambassadors based in Moscow for the upcoming inauguration ceremony. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, speaking in an interview with Channel One, described the decision to invite ambassadors from unfriendly countries as a complex one, yet emphasized that it served as a clear signal from Moscow to these states. Ryabkov remarked that the conduct of states that declined to send their diplomats is deemed as \"cheap.\"\n\n Bahrain\n China\n Cyprus\n Pierre Lévy, French Ambassador to Russia\n Greece\n Hungary\n India\n Iran\n Israel Ambassador Simona Halperin\n Korea DPR\n Malta\n Norway\n Portugal\n Singapore\n Slovakia\n South Korea\n United Arab Emirates\nDeclined invitation\nPashinyan said that he did not receive an invitation as reported. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said, “We believe that the isolation of Russia, especially its criminal leader, must continue... Participation in Putin’s inauguration is unacceptable for Lithuania.” Our priority remains supporting Ukraine and its people who are fighting against Russian aggression.” The US said they aren't sending any representatives to the inauguration. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said: \"We will not have a representative at his inauguration.\" In response to a question about whether the United States’ boycott of this ceremony means that it considers Putin an illegitimate president, Miller said: \"The elections weren't fair, but he still presides in Russia.\"\n\n Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of Armenia\n Austria\n Belgium\n Canada\n Czech Republic\n Estonia\n Finland\n Germany Ambassador Alexander Graf Lambsdorff\n Japan\n Latvia\n Lithuania\n Poland\n Sweden\n United Kingdom\n United States Ambassador Lynne M.

        "content": "Elmira Sultanovna Ibraimova (кирг. Эльмира Султан кызы Ибраимова; * April 13, 1962 in Frunze, Kyrgyzstan) is a former Kyrgyz civil servant, politician and deputy prime minister.\n\nShe is the youngest of three daughters of Sultan Ibraimov (1927 – 1980), Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic from 22 December 1978 until his assassination in 1980.\n\n\n== Early Years ==\nElmira Sultanovna was born in Frunze while her father was minister of Land Reclamation and Water Management in the government of Bolot Mambetov. She studied at M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University in Moscow, Russia, and obtained there a Master's degree in political economics in June 1984. She then worked seven years (1984–1991) in an electronic machinery plant in Frunze, rising to senior economist in its research & development section. From 1986 to 1991 she was also second secretary of one of the district committees of the Komsomol in Frunze.\n\n\n== Government Service ==\nFollowing the Independence of the former Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic on December 15, 1990, as the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, she joined the Kyrgyz civil service in May 1991, where she served until October 1996. There she held various positions in the administration of the national Parliament, culminating with that of Head of the General Administration Department and then Chief of the Secretariat of the Legislative Chamber, the Jogorku Keņesh. This service was interrupted from September 1993 to April 1995 when she studied with a Muskie Fellowship at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts and obtained there a Master's degree in Public Administration. From October 1996 until December 1998 she was Auditor of the Jogorku Kenesh in the Supreme Auditing Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic, and subsequently from December 1998 to September 1999 she was Deputy Chief of the Foreign Policy Department in the Administration of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic.\nFrom September 1999 through April 2001 she was her country's Permanent Representative and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United Nations in New York.\nFollowing a year without a government appointment, she was named in May 2002 to head the preparation unit for the Village Investment Project under the Prime Minister's Administration, and from October 2003 until 2007 she was executive director of the Community Development and Investment Agency (Agentstvo Razvitiya i Investirovaniya Soobshestv – ARIS) of the Kyrgyz Republic, established to implement this and subsequent rural and community development projects. Under her leadership ARIS became the main agency for implementing foreign aided projects in the rural communities of the country. In 2005 Elmira Sultanovna was one of the recipients of the Prize for Women's Creativity in Rural Life, awarded annually by the Women's World Summit Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland.\nWhen President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who had come to power in the wake of the Tulip Revolution in 2005, formed the Ak Jol party in October 2007, he asked her to join and to serve as one of its co-chairs.

It's a wild ride through Solo's brain.\"\nJay Richardson of The Scotsman, reviewing Palindrome, described his act as \"craftily intricate and exceptionally showy, nakedly, hungrily so. Yet the Australian commits to his nerdily sketchy, cinematically-framed hour with such vein-bulging energy, sprightly imagination and crowd-pumping zeal that you're swept along in its looping, mind-bending journey.\" He added that the show is also \"an effective satire on pretentious comedians' egotistical delusions and their self-inflicted punishment\".\nDan McInnes, reviewing for the Australian Arts Review, wrote that \"Solo is the kind of guy who seems to persist with paradox past the point that most of us give up\", adding that, \"along with his bumbling enjoyment of his own material, awkward moments are also part of his charm.\" Fynn Ryan wrote for Isolated Nation that \"Solo's brand of comedy is a chaotic and inclusive event which is at its best when the audience are in on the joke.\" However, he noted that some audience members \"may be put-off by Solo's hyperactive and post-modern\" style. Kym Clayton, of The Barefoot Review, described Solo in Palindrome as eccentric, unconventional, and intelligent. She praised his ability to \"turn sharp observation and oh-so-funny acidic comment on the seemingly ordinary things we do and the trite things we say in our daily lives\".\nSolo won the best comedy weekly award at the 2023 Adelaide Fringe and the 2024 Fringe World in Perth.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSolo lives  in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

She returned to the city of São Paulo in 1930 to attend school. In 1937, she enrolled in the University of São Paulo (USP) graduating with a bachelor's in philosophy in 1940. She was one of the first women to attend the university. While there, she studied under such notable professors as Roger Bastide, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Jean Maugüé.\nShe then helped found the cultural magazine Clima, alongside her future husband Antonio Candido and other young intellectuals of the era. In 1952, she received a doctorate in social sciences, with a thesis on 19th-century fashion, and in 1954 she became the founding director of the teaching of aesthetics at USP's Philosophy Department. She would go on to direct the department from 1969 to 1972, a period of significant repression of academics under the military dictatorship. In her time as an academic, she was particularly interested in studying the work of Mário de Andrade, with her publications including the central study O Tupi e o Alaúde on his Macunaíma.\nAfter retiring in 1973, in 1999 she was named professor emerita in the USP's Faculty of Philosophy, Letters, and Humanities.\nShe married the critic and sociologist Antonio Candido de Mello e Souza in 1943, and the couple had three children. Gilda de Melo e Souza died in 2005, at age 86, at São Paulo's Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital. In 2014, professor Walnice Nogueira Galvão published A palavra afiada, a collection of some of de Melo e Sousa's interviews, letters, and writings.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nO Tupi e o Alaúde: uma Interpretação de Macunaíma (1979, seminal work on the study of Macunaíma)\nMário de Andrade, obra escogida (1979)\nExercícios de leitura (1980)\nO espírito das roupas: a moda no século XIX (1987)\nOs melhores poemas de Mário de Andrade (editor, 2000)\nA ideia e o figurado (2005)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adrián Emilio de la Garza Santos (born 17 September 1971) is a Mexican lawyer and politician who served as the municipal president of Monterrey from 2015 to 2021 and as the attorney general of Nuevo León from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDe la Garza was born on 17 September 1971 in Monterrey, Nuevo León to Filiberto de la Garza de la Garza and Sandra Santos. His father served as the attorney general of Nuevo León from 1977 to 1979.\n\n\n== Attorney General of Nuevo León ==\nOn 3 February 2011, the Governor of Nuevo León, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, announced that he would nominate de la Garza as Attorney General. Seven days later, the Congress of Nuevo León held an extraordinary session and unanimously confirmed his nomination.\nDuring his tenure, the Attorney General's Office was restructured to create three regional offices: north, central, and south; the AMBER Alert system was implemented in the state; new uniforms for the Attorney General's Office were introduced; the new organic law of the state prosecutor's office was published, the Specialized Group for Immediate Search was created, and the renovation of the State Investigation Agency building was initiated.\nOn 24 January 2015, de la Garza resigned in order to contend for the Institutional Revolutionary Party's nomination for the municipal president of Monterrey in the 2015 state election.\n\n\n=== Link to Los Zetas ===\nIn October 2016, a police report by the Spanish National Police Corps implicated de la Garza as one of several political contacts of Juan Manuel Muñoz Luévano, alias \"El Mono\", during his tenure as Attorney General. This conclusion was drawn from years of wiretapping Muñoz Luévano. Earlier in the same year, Muñoz Luévano had been arrested for his alleged involvement in coordinating the transportation of cocaine into Europe for Los Zetas.\n\n\n== Municipal president of Monterrey ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== 2015 ====\nOn 15 January 2015, candidate registrations for the Institutional Revolutionary Party began. One week later, Senator Marcela Guerra, who had registered as a precandidate for the municipal president of Monterrey, withdrew in favor of de la Garza. The following day, de la Garza resigned from his position as attorney general to register as a precandidate for municipal president of Monterrey.\nOn 27 February 2015, the PRI confirmed him as their candidate, and on 2 March 2015, he registered with the State Electoral Commission as the candidate for the coalition Alianza por tu Seguridad, which consisted of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, New Alliance Party, and the Democratic Party.\nIn the election, de la Garza won with 34.4% of the votes, defeating his nearest opponent by nearly 8 points.\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\nIn early 2018, de la Garza shared a video on social media confirming his intention to seek reelection.\nIn the election, de la Garza lost to Felipe de Jesús Cantú of the National Action Party by 4,679 votes. De la Garza contested the election at the Electoral Tribunal of Nuevo León, which decided to annul ballot boxes favoring the National Action Party, thereby reversing the result and granting the office to de la Garza. However, the regional chamber of the Federal Electoral Tribunal overturned this decision, declaring Cantú the winner. De la Garza appealed to the highest chamber of the Federal Electoral Tribunal, which annulled the election and scheduled a special election for December.\nThe special election was held on 23 December 2018, in which de la Garza won with 41.22% of the vote, becoming the first municipal president of Monterrey to be reelected for a consecutive term. Turnout for this election was significantly lower than the previous one, with only 33.04% of citizens voting, compared to the 59.7% turnout in the previous election.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\n\n==== Fiscal policy ====\nIn his first year in office, de la Garza restructured Monterrey's debt, reducing the debt inherited from his predecessor, Margarita Arellanes Cervantes, by approximately 27%. By 2020, he had reduced it by 23% when compared to the initial amount. These efforts, combined with proactive tax policies, prompted various credit rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, HR Ratings, and Moody’s, to upgrade the municipality's credit rating, placing it above Mexico's average credit rating.\n\n\n==== Crime and policing ====\nDuring De la Garza's tenure, the municipality added 780 new vehicles to the police force between 2017 and 2020, built a new police academy with an investment of MXN $110 million, and, as part of the Sistema de Seguridad e Inteligencia (in English: Security and Intelligence System), installed four thousand CCTV cameras, establishing the city's first security camera system. However, in late 2021, his successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio Riojas, revealed that half of the security camera network was not functional and that 277 of the 452 patrol cars were inoperable.\nDe la Garza presided over a 79% increase in the homicide rate, from 130 homicides in 2015, when most of the year was under his predecessor, to 233 in 2021, the final year of his second term. The total number of homicides during his first term was 589, marking a 13% increase compared to his predecessor's term, which recorded 520 homicides. In his second term, the total number of homicides reached 680, reflecting a 17% increase compared to his first term. However, other crimes saw a decrease throughout both of his terms, with business robberies dropping by 52%, house robberies by 26%, and vehicle robberies by 24% between 2015 and 2021. \nDuring de la Garza's first term, the perception of security decreased every year, measured in the fourth trimester of each year, dropping from 32.2 in 2016 to its all-time low of 15.2 in 2018. However, during his second term, this figure increased every year, reaching 30.3 by 2021.\n\n\n==== Corruption ====\nDuring de la Garza's security projects, there were several irregularities with the invitations to tender. In 2016, his administration issued an invitation to tender for the purchase of sixty police motorcylces, but the specifications only allowed one company to participate, this being Harley-Davidson. It was also reported that before the invitation to tender had been issued, a local distributer, Coyote Harley-Davidson, had already ordered the sixty motorcycles. Additionally, in 2020, de la Garza's administration directly purchased two thousand security cameras without issuing an invitation to tender from a company that had supplied security cameras previously, justifying the purshase as providing continuity to the project, as the same cameras would be used.\nIn 2019, de la Garza appointed Federico Vargas as Monterrey's Secretary of Infrastructure, despite Vargas being banned from holding public office for ten years due to corruption during his tenure as the state's Secretary of Economic Development and Social Development under Governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz. NGO Redes Quinto Poder accused de la Garza of breaking the law by omitting Vargas' ban when appointing him to his cabinet.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carmen Maria Vazquez Rivera de Figueroa is a Puerto Rican United States Army and Air Force officer and nurse who served in both World War II and the Korean War. She is the widow of Puerto Rican politician, lawyer, medical doctor, and scholar Leopoldo Figueroa.\n\n\n== Early years and background ==\nCarmen Maria Vazquez Rivera was born on February 15, 1922, in Cidra, Puerto Rico. Vazquez is the daughter of Maria Engracia Rivera y Rodriguez and Nicasio Vazquez Noguera. She was the first of six children, and niece of the regional Cidra-based businessman Manuel Rivera, Maria Engracia's brother. Carmen and her siblings Nicasio, Laura, Roberto, Jose and Carola, were raised in Cidra.\n\n\n=== Medical career ===\nIn 1938 Vazquez decided to pursue a career in medicine at the age of sixteen and began studies to become a nurse. She first studied nursing in the Escuela del Distrito de Bayamón, where she graduated in 1942. She then continued her education with a course in obstetrics from the Hospital de la Capital de San Juan. There she served in numerous capacities including as an anesthesiologist of dystocic cases, auxiliary operating room supervisor, and instructor of auxiliary nurses. During this period she also joined the Red Cross. In addition to her nursing education, Vazquez also studied Domestic Economy from the University of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nAt the start of the United States involvement in WWII, the US Army and Navy Nurse Corps were not accepting Puerto Rican nurses. This position was reversed in April 1944, and Vazquez joined the US Army that first year in December as a nurse. She quickly served in numerous leadership capacities, including becoming Head Nurse in charge of the orthopedic department San Juan's Fort Brooke and held the rank of Second Lieutenant. Vazquez's other roles included serving as an auxiliary operating room supervisor, an instructor of auxiliary nurses, as well as performing the delivery of over 100 births.\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, Vazquez became a decorated veteran following her wartime service and received a signed letter from President Truman. She was later transferred to the hospital of Trinidad in 1946, after which she was honorably discharged and returned to her civilian nursing career.\n\n\n=== Korean War ===\n\nIn 1953 Vazquez was recruited back to the armed services during the Korean War. For her second period of service, Vazquez was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant and served in the US Air Force. Following her Air Force service, Vazquez remained in the US Air Force Nurse Corps Reserve for twenty years until 1973.\n\n\n== Post-military career and later years ==\nFollowing her WWII service, Vazquez returned to her civilian nursing career and relocated to New York in the late 1940s. In New York she studied physical therapy in Columbia University and practiced nursing at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Vazquez also studied and was certified in Criminology from Bolan Academy in New York.\nShe then moved to Miami Beach where, in 1955, she became licensed to practice nursing in the state of Florida. While in Miami Beach she practiced in Mount Sinai Hospital. By the 1960s Vazquez had relocated back to Puerto Rico and lived in the capital of San Juan. There she would donate her specialized medical background in service of the community as a Mutual Aid nurse and volunteer.\nFollowing her retirement in Puerto Rico, Vazquez later relocated to the Florida capital of Tallahassee and became a member of several US veterans organizations including the American Legion and the Veterans Club of the 65th Infantry, the latter of which became known as \"The Borinqueneers” during the Korean War.\nVazquez turned 100 in 2022, during which a resurgence of interest in her life and career resulted in several honors and recognitions from public figures and organizations.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVazquez was twice married to Puerto Rican medical doctor, lawyer, politician, and scholar Leopoldo Figueroa. The couple first met in the San Jan municipal hospital when Figueroa was Vazquez's clinical instructor in the obstetrician ward during the 1940s. The pair were married following the conclusion of WWII, though they would divorce before the end of the decade.\nIn the 1950s Vazquez had had three children, a son and two daughters. She had her son Gabriel with Edward Lewison in 1954, her daughter Janice with medical doctor Jose Vigoreux in 1955, and her daughter Carol with her second husband Paul E. Giguere in 1957. While in Puerto Rico, Vazquez and Giguere had divorced by the end of the decade, after which Vazquez reunited with Figueroa who had himself also divorced from his second wife. After reuniting, the couple remarried in 1963 and remained together until Figueroa's death in 1969.  Vazquez cared for Figueroa as his health declined during his finals years.\n\n\n== Military service decorations ==\nAmong Vazquez's service awards and decorations are:\n\nAmerican Campaign Medal\nWWII Victory Medal\nOverseas Service Bars (3)\nNational Defense Service Medal\n\n\n== Legacy and civilian honors ==\nSince retiring from military service, Vazquez has been honored and recognized by several organizations, institutions, and government bodies.\nOn November 7, 2009, Vazquez was honored with a Proclamation from the New York State Senate. On the month of her 90th birthday, she was honored with a Resolution from the Senate of Puerto Rico on February 23, 2012. Vazquez is also a past recipient of the Medal of Distinction from the American Legion, Post 113.\nIn 2012 she was included in the book Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, El Ideario de un Decano 1889 – 1969, published by the Office of the Official Historian of Puerto Rico.\nVazquez received renewed recognition on her 100th birthday in 2022, during which her service was honored by public officials, civic groups, media, and the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs. Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in the U.S. House of Representatives, Jenniffer González, honored Vazquez by entering a Statement into the Congressional Record of the United States Congress and having an American Flag flown over the United States Capitol in honor of her service with an accompanying statement reading \"Her service, character, and pioneering spirit are a beacon to us all\" (flag record: 2022–011123–01). Former Congressman, Governor, and then-Gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist published a letter to Vazquez on social media marking her 100th birthday and paying tribute to her service.\nIn July, Vazquez was awarded the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Presidential Medal of Freedom, the organization's highest honor, during the 2022 LULAC conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nRecords on Vazquez's military career are held in the Women's Military Memorial (reference Member ID: 511557).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLeopoldo Figueroa\nCarmen Contreras-Bozak\nCarmen Lozano Dumler\nCarmen García Rosado\nList of Puerto Ricans\nList of Puerto Rican military personnel\nPuerto Rican women in the military\nPuerto Ricans in World War II\nMilitary history of Puerto Rico\nHistory of women in Puerto Rico\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDr. Leopoldo Figueroa, El Ideario de un Decano 1889 – 1969 (In Spanish); Author: Jose Luis Colon Gonzalez.",

        "content": "Health systems science (HSS) is a foundational platform and framework for the study and understanding of how care is delivered, how health professionals work together to deliver that care, and how the health system can improve patient care and health care delivery. It is one of the three pillars of medical education along with the basic and clinical sciences. HSS includes the following core foundational domains: health care structure and process; health system improvement; value in health care; population, public, and social determinants of health; clinical informatics and health technology; and health care policy and economics. It also includes four functional domains: ethics and legal; change agency, management, and advocacy; teaming; and leadership. Systems thinking links all of these domains together. Patient, family, and community are at the center of HSS.\n\n\n== History and development ==\nHSS, which was originally referred to as systems-based practice, emerged in response to the growing recognition that effective health care delivery requires more than just clinical expertise. It acknowledges that health care systems are complex, adaptive systems influenced by a multitude of factors, including social determinants of health, policy decisions, organizational structures, and patient preferences.\nThe World Health Organization first recognized the need to educate physicians about the link between health and the systems in which people live, work, and play in 1978. The quality and patient safety movement of the 1980s and 1990s further reinforced the need for physicians to understand systems thinking. The Association of American Medical Colleges' Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency (CEPAERs) started including identifying system failures and making contributions to a culture of safety and improvement in 1999. That year, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education also included systems-based practice as one of its six core competency domains. In 2001, the Health Resources and Services Administration funded an 18-medical-school consortium to launch several pilots related to systems-based education. In 2005, the book, Professionalism in Tomorrow's Healthcare System, outlined several aspects of the systems-based practice competency.\nMedical schools and residency and fellowship programs, however, struggled to teach these competencies. The framework for HSS was developed to address this struggle and is built on a foundation of systems thinking and the biopsychosocial model developed by George L. Engel. It aims to educate physicians to become systems citizens.\nFrom 2013 to 2015 the American Medical Association's (AMA) Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium of 11 U.S. medical schools worked to identify a comprehensive framework for HSS training. In 2017, a review of 30 grant submissions to the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative and an analysis of the HSS-related curricula at the 11 medical schools that were members of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium formed the groundwork toward the development of a potential comprehensive HSS curricular framework with domains and subcategories.\nBarriers to incorporating HSS into medical education include student resistance because it is not always viewed as essential to passing physician licensing and credentialing exams and limitations in the number of medical school faculty with expertise to teach HSS domains.\nAn increasing number of new medical schools have created their initial curriculum with HSS fully integrated including Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, which matriculated its first class in July 2020, and the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, which is expected to matriculate its first class in 2025.\n\n\n== Future directions ==\nAs health care continues to evolve, the importance of HSS is expected to grow. Efforts to integrate HSS into medical education and practice will be essential for preparing physicians to navigate the complexities of modern health care delivery, advocate for their patients, and contribute to improving the health of populations.\nHSS is also expanding to other health professions. In 2023, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a series of workshops focused on integrating HSS across the learning curriculum. HSS has been expanding to physician assistants, nurses, and other health care professionals.\n\n\n== Notable figures and organizations ==\nSusan Skochelak, MD, MPH, creator of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative and lead editor of the first and second editions of the Health Systems Science textbook.\nSchools involved in the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative that helped create the HSS framework:\n\nWarren Alpert Medical School of Brown University\nBrody School of Medicine at East Carolina University\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine\nUniversity of California, Davis, School of Medicine\nIndiana University School of Medicine\nMayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine\nUniversity of Michigan Medical School\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine\nOregon Health & Science University School of Medicine\nPenn State University College of Medicine\nVanderbilt University School of Medicine\n\n\n== See also ==\nMedical humanities\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peltigera alkalicola is a rare species of terricolous (ground-dwelling) foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. First described in 2022 from specimens collected in the Kilimanjaro National Park in Tanzania, it is characterised by its unique ecological preferences. Analysis of DNA samples indicate that the lichen may also occur in Alaska, USA, and Ningxia, China, suggesting a wider distribution in cold, montane ecosystems.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPeltigera alkalicola was formally described by the Finnish lichenologist Ulla Kaasalainen in 2022. It is closely related to Peltigera lepidophora but can be distinguished by its smaller size, the distinct colour of its isidia, and its genetic makeup. The type specimen of Peltigera alkalicola was collected in Tanzania within the Kilimanjaro National Park, specifically between the Maua and Marangu routes. It was found on soil amidst Helichrysum heath at an elevation of 4,390 m (14,400 ft). This collection, made on 8 June 2017, is designated as the holotype. The specific epithet alkalicola refers to the species' preference for alkaline substrates, particularly the alkaline trachybasaltic lava found in its type locality.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPeltigera alkalicola forms a small thallus, typically 1–5 cm (3⁄8–2 in) in diameter, but usually smaller, about 1–2 cm (3⁄8–3⁄4 in). It has thick, rounded to elongate lobes that are up to 1–2 cm long and 1 cm wide. The lobes often have rounded ends with upturned margins and may appear slightly crisped. The upper surface is tomentose, often slightly scabrous, and greyish-brown in colour. In contrast, the lower surface is generally white to pale brown, with veins that are the same colour or slightly darker and rhizines that are more abundant centrally, becoming shorter near the margins. This species develops peltate isidia, which are small, dark brown to almost black outgrowths on the upper surface that are distinctly darker than the thallus surface.\nThe species does not typically produce apothecia (sexual reproductive structures) or pycnidia (asexual reproductive structures), and no secondary metabolites (lichen products) have been detected by thin-layer chromatography. All standard chemical spot tests are negative.\n\n\n== Habitat, distribution, and ecology ==\nPeltigera alkalicola is found in high-elevation habitats, specifically in open, subalpine and alpine heathlands at elevations between 3,940 and 4,390 m (12,930 and 14,400 ft). It is adapted to growing on trachybasaltic volcanic rock, a type of alkaline substrate, and is often associated with sparse vegetation and bryophytes. At the time of its original publication, the species was known to occur only from a few locations on Mt Kilimanjaro and is considered rare. The collection sites for Peltigera alkalicola receive between 900 and 1,100 mm (35 and 43 in) of rainfall annually, maintain a relative humidity of 60 to 80%, and have an average annual temperature of 4 °C (39 °F).\nInitially discovered in Tanzania, genetic analysis suggests that Peltigera alkalicola may also be present in Alaska, USA, and Ningxia, China, indicating a wider distribution across diverse and extreme habitats. This distribution pattern highlights the species' preference for cold, montane regions and alkaline substrata.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was released on April 17, 2024, by the record label Avex Trax.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe title of the album Classy Crush originated from @onefive's group concept, \"Japanese Classy Crush\". \"Classy\" refers to old things, stereotypical images and ways of thinking, and conventional ways of doing things. \"Crush\" expresses @onefive's desire to destroy things of that nature, which hold them back, and to move forward in a new way.\nThe album represented a shift for @onefive toward the direction of hip hop, especially with the release of the single \"Justice Day\". Other musical influences included jungle, Jersey club, and Middle Eastern music. Many of the songs depict strong Japanese girls.\nThe single \"Miraizu\" (未来図) marked @onefive's major label debut with Avex Trax. It was used as the theme song for the live-action television drama adaptation of the manga If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die, which was first broadcast in October 2022. \"Chance\" was used as the theme song for the film adaptation that followed on May 12, 2023.\nIn August 2023, \"Like A\" was featured in a commercial for the Japanese jewelry brand The Kiss. In April 2024, \"Mr.Gorgeous\" was featured in a commercial for Amazon Prime Video.\nClassy Crush was released in two versions, with one containing a Blu-ray disc in addition to the CD. The album charted at number 16 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and at number 17 on the weekly Billboard Japan Top Album Sales chart.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jantar Mantar (Japanese: ジャンタルマンタル, foaled March 21, 2021) is an active Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse. His major wins include the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes and the NHK Mile Cup.\nHe was named after Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory in India. He was awarded the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Colt for 2023.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 2023: two-year-old season ===\nJantar Mantar debuted at the Kyoto Racecourse on October 8, 2023, in a two-year-old newcomer race on turf at a distance of 1,800 meters. Ridden by Katsuma Sameshima, he was the second favored horse. After settling in a good position from the start of the race, he broke away at the final stretch to win by two and a half horse lengths over Keep Calm.\nOn December 17, he made his first grade one stakes race debut at the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse. Ridden by Yuga Kawada, he was the most favored horse to win the race. Settling near the rail at the middle of the pack early on, he moved up near the front by the fourth corner as the race progressed. Then at the final straight, he quickly broke away from the pack and successfully held off the fast-finishing Ecoro Walz to win the race and clinch his first grade one win.\n\n\n=== 2024: three-year-old season ===\nJantar Mantar made his three-year-old season debut at the Kyodo Tsushin Hai, moving back up to a distance of 1,800 meters at Tokyo Racecourse. He settled in midfield throughout the race but failed to chase down Justin Milano, who moved up early, finishing second place.\nTwo months later, he once again moved up in distance to race at the Satsuki Shō (Japanese 2000 Guineas) at a distance of 2,000 meters at Nakayama Racecourse. After surviving through the grueling fast pace set by Meisho Tabaru, he moved up to the front early in the final stretch but was overtaken by the fast-finishing Justin Milano and Cosmo Kuranda and ended up at third place.\nThree weeks later, he dropped down in distance to a mile to race at the NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse. He broke off well from the gates and settled in a good position up front. In the final straight, he pulled away from the pack and maintained the lead to win the race, holding off Ascoli Piceno.\n\n\n== Racing statistics ==\nBelow data is based on data available on JBIS Search, and NetKeiba.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In 1563, a Spanish military expedition was launched to reconquer the exclave of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, which was under the control of the Ottomans. The campaign ended in a fiasco for the Spanish troops.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1522, Spain lost the peñón to a Moroccan Berber attack that resulted in the deaths of the entire Spanish garrison. Ali Abu Hassun, the new Wattasid ruler of Morocco in 1554, then gave the peñón to the Ottoman troops who had assisted him in gaining the throne. In 1525, the Spanish made an attempt to recover the islet but were defeated. After the victory at Oran, king Philip II of Spain decided to take advantage by launching a counter strike against Barbary haven, which is Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera.\n\n\n== Expedition ==\nIn 1563, the Spanish prepared another campaign against Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera. The command was given to Don Sanco de Leyva. The Spanish prepared an armada of 50 galleys and 7,000 men. The Spanish armada left Málaga on July 23. At Peñón, the Spanish governor, Pedro Venegas, made a plan by scaling the walls at night. He had fifty volunteers, accompanied by the eighth galleys of Álvaro de Bazán; however, the assault ended in failure after someone made a noise which alarmed the garrison and alarmed the others by firing cannons and dawn had arrived.\nDespite this failure, Sancho did not give up and landed between 4,000 and 5,000 men six miles away from the rock in an attempt to capture it by land, however, the night assault again ended in failure as the defenders were alarmed. Ottoman galleys began appearing to support the garrison. The failure of the assault frustrated Sancho who held a council. The majority agreed to withdraw, except Álvaro de Bazán, who argued for the continuation of the campaign. He even proposed ideas for another assault, but Sancho ordered the troops to reembark.\nThe Spanish troops began leaving, but during their retreat, the Ottoman garrison and the Gomera Berbers attacked them with their artillery, inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish. The Muslims had acquired great loot the Spanish left. The Spanish returned to Malaga on August 2.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAgustín R.

        "content": "Iraq–Somalia relations refer to foreign relations between Iraq and Somalia. Both nations are Arab League & Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members and maintain relations.\n\n\n== History ==\nDiplomatic relations between Iraq and Somalia was established on 17 October 1966. Like other neighbouring nations, both nations underwent socialist military coups in the late 1960s, Iraq's 17 July Revolution in 1968 and Somalia's 1969 coup d'état. This provided Ba'athist Iraq and the Somali Democratic Republic opportunities to collaborate in technical, military and economic affairs. Up until the collapse of their respective governments, Iraq and Somalia maintained a special relationship. In Somalia, there are numerous towns and villages named after things and places from Iraq, i.e. Baqdaad, Middle Shabelle.\nIraq was one of Somalia's top trading partners and Iraq invested and constructed energy infrastructure within Somalia. Iraq also provided scholarships for Somali students to study at Iraqi universities as it did for other Arab states. Somalia would also sell armaments & components to Iraq to bolster Iraq's domestic military industry. Additionally, Somalia is heavily suspected to be a major source of fissile material in Iraqi attempts to construct a nuclear weapon. In fact, despite not having a functioning government at the time, the United States Intelligence Community's National Intelligence Estimate of 2002 stated that Somalia was one of the suspected nations to be a source of yellowcake uranium.\nIn 1973, Somalia strongly supported the Arab coalition of the Yom Kippur War in which Iraq was a major participant.\nIn 1977, the Ogaden War broke out, Iraq was staunchly pro-Somalia, sending infantry, military intelligence officers and an expeditionary air force squadron led by then-Colonel Hakam Hassan in support of the Somali Air Force. Furthermore, Iraq refused to let Soviet Air Force fighters to refuel in Iraq and not allow them to use Iraqi airspace for the Soviet intervention in the war. Iraq's friction with the Soviet Union surrounding other issues allowed Iraq to grow closer to Somalia.\nIn 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and the subsequent Iran–Iraq War occurs, with Iranian attacks on Iraqi oil installations throughout the 1980s, Iraq is unable to provide Somalia with investments and with Somalia's then tense relationships with both the United States and Soviet Union, Somalia enters a period of sharp decline.\nSomalia was strongly and deeply against the 2003 invasion and subsequent Iraq War. Notably, there were major anti-war protests in Mogadishu in support of Iraq.\n\n\n== Diplomatic missions ==\nSomalia has an embassy in Baghdad, and Iraq is slated to reopen its embassy in Mogadishu. The current Somali ambassador to Iraq is Dr. Liban Sheikh Mahmood and Iraq currently maintains a non-resident embassy in Nairobi.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "101 Ash Street is an unoccupied office building in the downtown core of San Diego, California. The steel and concrete structure was built in 1967 on a rectangular 180 ft (55 m) x 70 ft (21 m) footprint. The building is 21 stories with two additional underground levels for a basement-to-roof height of 315 ft (96 m) and a square footage of 447,732 sq ft (41,595.7 m2), including the 240-car garage.\nThe building was occupied by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) from 1968 to 1998, and then by SDGE parent Sempra Energy from 1998 to 2015.\nIn 2016, Mayor Kevin Faulconer announced a $128 million lease-to-own deal under which the city would acquire the building as-is from owner Cisterra Development and at the end of the 20-year lease own the building free-and-clear. After the deal closed in January 2017, asbestos was discovered, complicating needed renovation work and delaying the move of workers into the building. In August 2018, the San Diego City Council approved a Faulconer administration plan to invest an additional $30 million into the site for renovations. Hundreds of city workers were moved into the building in December 2019; however, by January 2020, the mayor announced an evacuation of the building for safety reasons following asbestos violations by county regulators.\nIn September 2020, the city suspended monthly lease payments due to a lawsuit brought by a resident seeking to nullify the original contract and recover taxpayer losses. In July 2022, the City Council approved a settlement with Cisterra Development, agreeing to pay the developer $86 million for the property while receiving back a refund of $7.5 million from the original lease-to-own payments. San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott, who approved the initial deal, had urged the council to reject the proposal. The city recuperated an additional $9.4 million in March 2023 after suing Jason Hughes, the real estate broker on the original deal.\nIn August 2023, La Jolla developer Reven Capital proposed converting the building into affordable housing as a part of the city's request for proposals on future development for the site and surrounding publicly owned land.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDowntown San Diego\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1920–21 Amherst men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\n\n\n== Season ==\nAmherst had high hoped for its first full season since 1914 and got to work right after the football season was finished. Pratt Field was once again the team's home and once the rink had finished freezing, the prospective players were put through their paces. However, after returning from the exam break, several players (including Leon Plumer) were ruled academically ineligible and would not be able to play for the rest of the season.\nThe handicapped purple opened their season against one of the nation's top teams in Dartmouth. Though they lost, Amherst showed a solid level of compete by keeping the score close. A few days later, the team got its first home game of the season and met cross-town rivals Massachusetts Agricultural. Goaltender Francis Plimpton was the star for Amherst but he was unable to help the team with its biggest problem: scoring. The purple were only able to get six shots on goal for the entire game and, although Davidson was able to get one marker, it wasn't enough and the team lost 1–2. The next game had virtually the same outcome with Davidson getting the only goal for Amherst in a 1–2 loss and it was becoming quite apparent that the missing talent was holding the team back.\nA week later, Amherst was off to play YMCA College and the team got off to a fast start. The purple got an early lead but were unable to build on the advantage. YMCA tied the game in the second half but Plimpton prevented any further scoring and the two went into overtime. The Maroons struck quick and took the lead, then held Amherst off for the remainder of the match. Two more losses in quick succession left the team with just one final opportunity to get a win. Unfortunately, the offense wasn't able to get anything going in the rematch with Williams and Amherst ended the year with a perfect losing season.\nBradford L. Church served as team manager with Frank A. Myers as his assistant.\nNote: Amherst teams did not have any nickname prior to 1921.\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jan Felkl (20 May 1817 – 7 October 1887) was a Czech globe maker and industrialist. He came from Banín, but settled in Prague where he got to know cartographer and globe maker Václav Merklas. Merklas soon after gifted his tools to Felkl, who set up his own workshop in the Old Town of Prague in the early 1850s.\nFelkl's company grew rapidly and was eventually to become the most important and internationally most well-known globe manufacturing firm of Austria-Hungary. In 1870 the factory for the manufacturing of Felkl's globes relocated from Prague to the nearby town of Roztoky. By 1873 it produced 15,000 globes annually and, by 1877, in 17 languages. After Jan Felkl's death, the company continued to produce globes until 1952, when it closed due to setbacks suffered from market loss after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, legal conflicts, World War II, the installation of the Communist regime, and not least stiffening competition.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJan Felkl was born on 20 May 1817 in Banín, in what is today the Czech Republic but was then the Austrian Empire. He was the son of an ethnic German farmer. His interest in globe making was supposedly born when he was a conscripted soldier in the Imperial Austrian Army, and had a superior whose hobby was globe making. With the military he came to Prague, where he after his discharge found a job working for the postal service and settled in Hradčany. In Prague he got to know cartographer Václav Merklas, who had made the first Czech-language globe in 1848. Merklas soon thereafter took up a teaching position and abandoned further attempts at globe making, and therefore gifted his tools to Felkl in 1849. Felkl moved to the Old Town in 1850 and only began producing his own globes sometimes after this. They were initially copies of Merklas' models with diameters of 2.5 inches (6.4 cm), 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) and 4.5 inches (11 cm), respectively. Two friends from his military days helped Felkl set up his workshop. He formally founded a globe making company in 1854.\n\n\n== Globe manufacturing ==\nThe business grew rapidly. In 1855, the firm produced 800 globes annually; by 1873 it had expanded to 15,000 globes annually. Felkl employed a simple manufacturing technique, whereby plaster globes were moulded in brass moulds, onto which printed and initially hand-painted paper slips were attached. Later, some globes would also be made of cardboard. With the introduction of colouring by lithography, as opposed to by hand, production costs went down further. The printing was done in Prague but from the outset also in Leipzig. With the rapid growth of the company, in 1870 the factory for the manufacturing of Felkl's globes relocated from Prague to the nearby town of Roztoky. At that time, the company employed around 24 people. Felkl also set up his own lithographic printing office in Prague c. 1873. In the same year, at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, Felk's globes were awarded the first prize, and the next year one of the German-language versions of the globes was approved for use in primary and secondary schools in Austria-Hungary. This was followed by an approval in 1879 to use a Czech-language version in Czech-language schools. Felkl's son entered the company in 1875 has his father's business partner, whereafter the firm was known as \"Felkl & Son\". The firm had its heyday in the 1890s. At its peak, it was the most important and internationally most well-known globe manufacturing firm of Austria-Hungary. It dominated the domestic market and exported thousands of globes. \nThough his first globe models were with text in Czech, early on he began printing and manufacturing globes in German, which opened a larger market. Felkl thereafter soon expanded to producing globes in other languages as well, using translations from the German-language globes. By 1861 Felkl produced globes in English, Dutch, Hungarian, Polish and Russian. By 1877, Felkl's company offered globes in 17 different languages.\nAlready in 1855, Felkl also produced a celestial globe, which he had developed with the aid of the director of the Prague observatory, Joseph Böhm. Felkl also cooperated with others in producing his terrestrial globes, including German geographer Otto Delitsch (who aided Felkl in designing a relief globe) and Czech statistician Josef Erben, who collaborated with Felkl on finding the right terminology for the Czech globes. Apart from globes, the company also produced a range of other instruments such as telluria and orreries.\nJan Felkl married Maria Anna Jakob and the couple had nine children. Jan Felkl died on 7 October 1887. After his death, the company continued to operate and remained a family business. Production stood still between the advent of World War I in 1914 and 1921. The dissolution of Austria-Hungary after the war meant that the domestic market vanished. The company had a second period of success after 1924, when it pioneered selling illuminated globes. However, legal conflicts, World War II, the installation of the Communist regime, and not least stiffening competition led to its decline. The company formally closed in 1952.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nDörflinger, Johannes (1987). \"PRINTED AUSTRIAN GLOBES (18th TO EARLY 20th CENTURIES) / GEDRUCKTE ÖSTERREICHISCHE GLOBEN (18. bis Anfang 20.

He also worked in government and private sectors, including as a White House counselor on aging during the Carter Administration and collaborating with labor unions and organizations focused on aging issues.\nSheppard's research focused on the challenges faced by older workers, particularly in the context of job loss and retirement. His 1959 study, Too Old to Work, Too Young to Retire: A Case Study of a Permanent Plant Shutdown, examined the impact of the closure of Packard's Detroit facility on its older workers.\nSheppard authored, co-authored, and edited books and articles on aging and employment, including Where Have All the Robots Gone? (1972), The Graying of Working America (1979), and The Future of Older Workers (1990).\nFrom 1983 to 1991, Sheppard served as the director of the International Exchange Center on Gerontology at the University of South Florida, where he continued his professorship until his death in 1997.\n\n\n== References ==",

They were formed in the Gold Coast by Kai James on lead vocals, Jayden Williams on lead guitar and Aunt Liss (Melissa James) on drums. Fraser Bell later joined on bass guitar. Girl and Girl were signed by Sub Pop in 2023, and their debut album is due on 24 May 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nVocalist Kai James and guitarist Jayden Williams began jamming in James' mother's garage. One day, James' Aunt Liss (Melissa James) joined them on drums after walking her dog. Girl and Girl were formed in Gold Coast, in 2020, by James, Williams, Liss and Jayden's brother Coby Williams on bass guitar. The quartet's early singles were \"Shame Its not Now\" and \"White Tiles\" (April 2021). Their first extended play, A Typical Friday Night (Shame, Sex And Misery), was issued in October, together with a music video for its single, \"Doctor Marten\". Initially intended as a temporary arrangement, Aunt Liss became a permanent member of the band and they were later joined by bass guitarist, Fraser Bell. Their second EP is the six-track, Divorce, which was issued independently in September 2022. Coby co-wrote \"Dance Now\" with James but had left the band before the EP was released.\nIn 2023 the band were signed by Sub Pop and released the single, \"All I See\", and re-released \"Dance Now\". Their second EP was re-released, extended to eight tracks, as Divorce+, appeared in June. On 24 May 2024 Girl and Girl are scheduled to release their debut album, Call a Doctor.

After the violent attack by non-campus individuals on pro-Palestine student protestors at UCLA and the subsequent police crackdown on May 1 and 2, 2024, UAW Local 4811 issued a statement announcing that it would hold a strike authorization vote in the following week.\n\nThe union, in its statement, also called for UCLA Chancellor Gene Block to resign immediately given what they called his \"failure of leadership\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Constructed in 1969 by Winston Bronnum, Big Potato Man serves as a form of roadside advertisement for the adjacent farming business.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBig Potato Man is a large potato sculpture in Maugerville, New Brunswick. Made using concrete, it stands at a height of 20 feet (6.1 m) with a thickness of 3 feet (0.91 m). The sculpture has two legs, arms resembling twigs, a smiling face, and sports a black top hat. Big Potato Man was created in 1969 by sculptor Winston Bronnum for Karl Harvey, as a means to advertise the roadside stand for his family farming business.\nBig Potato Man stands along Route 105, which was formerly part of the Trans-Canada Highway. Since 1969, it has stood at the front of a farming business.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn 1921, J. H. Harvey bought a farm in Maugerville, a small community along the Saint John River between Fredericton and Oromocto. The Harvey family ran a business, known then as Harvey's, selling vegetables at their roadside stand.\n\n\n=== Big Potato Man ===\nIn 1968, Karl Harvey, who ran the family farming business at the time, sought the creation for a large potato sculpture, seeking a creative method to advertise his stand. In 1969, Karl had Big Potato Man built. Created by sculptor Winston Bronnum using concrete, the sculpture measured 20 feet (6.1 m) high and had a thickness of 3 feet. Big Potato Man proved successful for the business, with Gordon (Buzz) Harvey, Karl's son, later saying \"he doubled our business within three to four years pretty well.\" Following Karl Harvey's death in 1996, the $1,500 Karl Harvey Memorial Scholarship was posthumously created in his honour. On March 24, 1999, the sculpture was nearly destroyed when a fire struck the business.\nIn November 2015, the farm and home of Big Potato Man, then known as Harvey's Big Potato farm, was put up for sale. Silver Valley Farms began leasing the farm in 2016, and would take ownership of the establishment in September 2021. In April 2022, Silver Valley Farms sought repairs for Big Potato Man, which was at risk of collapsing. However, repair costs quoted at CA$10,000 prompted the creation of a GoFundMe campaign, which quickly racked in support. The fundraiser raised over CA$4,600 within the first 48 hours, and successfully reached its goal within nearly two weeks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe World's Largest Lobster, another sculpture made by Bronnum\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Piano Concerto, Op. 40, is a work for piano and orchestra completed by Airat Ichmouratov between 2012 and 2013. Composition remained untouched for a span of ten years until the composer crossed paths with a soloist, Montreal-based pianist Jean-Philippe Sylvestre. Sylvestre's keen enthusiasm for performing the concerto, coupled with his ability to \"do it justice and add finishing touches,\" as described by the composer, led to the revival of the piece. The Piano Concerto was recorded by Chandos on April 19–20, 2022, at St. Luke's in London, with Jean-Philippe Sylvestre as the soloist and the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of the composer. Its first public performance took place on May 1, 2024, at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City, with Sylvestre as the soloist, accompanied by the Quebec Symphony Orchestra under Ichmouratov.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Concerto comprises 3 movements. A typical performance lasts somewhat around 38 minutes.\n\nIchmouratov, recognized as a significant figure in contemporary neo-romantic music internationally and often hailed as a prominent Russian musical figure in Quebec, openly acknowledges the influence of esteemed Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Mussorgsky, and Shostakovich, among others, on his music. This influence is evident in his typical style, characterized by neo-romanticism, in this case, a Piano Concerto, featuring melodious and harmonically rich content infused with elements drawn from Russian folk music.\nAccording to Geoff Pearce of Classical Music Daily the composition unfolds across three distinct movements. Exhibiting a romantic flair, the musical style is characterized by virtuosity and a somewhat rhapsodic nature. Filled with abundant energy, it includes frequent mood changes. The first movement encapsulates the essence of the entire piece and could function effectively as an independent work. It traverses a spectrum of emotions, ranging from fervently virtuosic passages to moments of dramatic intensity and serene reflection. The orchestral sections demonstrate skillful composition, while the solo passages require significant technical proficiency from the instruments, especially the woodwinds. The piano part adheres to the tradition of late nineteenth-century Russian piano concertos. \nAteş Orga mentions in his article on Colin's Column the form of the concerto, labeling it as an \"episodic traversal\". He describes the Piano Concerto as an episodic journey, traversing through tempo-contrasted sections. Ideas, once introduced, are revisited in various forms—sometimes abbreviated, hinted at, or even left unresolved—reflecting the unpredictable nature of Ichmouratov's approach to keys. \"When I compose, I'm guided by a particular tonality and simply follow its course, often leading to unexpected key relationships,\" composer explains. Michael Church of BBC Music Magazine also calls Ichmouratov's form in Piano concerto as \"episodic\".\n\n\n=== I. Andante affettuoso - Allegro vivace - Andante cantabile - Allegro vivace ===\nFrom the beginning, the timpani alternate between tonic and dominant, as observed in Arthur Kaptainis's analysis. The piano enters with a contemplative melody in D Minor, softly articulated in octaves. This theme evolves harmonically and transitions into an Allegro vivace, where the piano and woodwinds engage in exchange. The buoyant atmosphere gradually diminishes as the piano introduces a noble Andante cantabile theme through a short recitative in G minor. A grand climax featuring the full orchestra gives way to a piano cadenza. Although the recapitulation initially returns to the expected home key of D minor, it eventually resolves in a resolute conclusion in G minor, accentuated by the soloist's assertive fortissimo double octaves.\nMain theme in the first movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 3–6\n\nAllegro vivace theme in the first movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 16–17\n\nAndante Cantabile theme in the first movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 155–158\n\n\n=== II. Grave Solenne ===\nArthur Kaptainis notes that the Ichmouratov regards the central movement, Grave solenne, as a personal reflection encompassing \"my thoughts, my feelings, my nostalgia, my sorrow, and my happiness.\" It begins with a solemn chorale for strings, evoking heartfelt sentiments reminiscent of the final movement of Mahler's Third Symphony. Although initially in C Major, the atmosphere conveys a distinct melancholy, with much of the movement set in C Minor. The piano enters quietly against the gentle clock-like pulse of a harp. Initially, the winds share the spotlight equally, but gradually, the soloist takes charge with increasingly assertive chords. A dramatical climax in C Major is followed by a section where the piano engages in delicate exchanges with the woodwinds and this time clock-like pulse of a glockenspiel. Finally, a soft chord from the piano settles the tonal dispute in favor of the minor mode.\nGrave Solenne theme in the second movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 464–467\n\n\n=== III. Allegro moderato - Andante - Tempo I ===\nThe finale takes a hopeful turn, Allegro moderato commencing with a burst of orchestral grandeur. Amidst the commotion, the piano introduces an energetic melody in B flat, followed by other instruments, including the xylophone. Trills lead to the introduction of the Andante's second theme by the oboe, sharing the signature rising triplet figure with the previous theme. After some development, including the return of the fanfare, the main theme resurfaces in B flat Minor, following an energetic section marked con sarcasmo. Strings then take over with longer passages played against a restless pulse. The final rendition of the main theme deviates from the expected B flat Major to C Major, the key symbolizing hope in the slow movement.\nAllegro moderato theme in the third movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 551–554\n\nPresto impetuoso theme, marked as con Sarcasmo in the third movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\n\nmm. 637–641\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n\nThe Piano Concerto is scored for the following orchestra (percussion, performed by 3 players):\n\n2 flutes\n2 oboes\n2 clarinets in B♭\n2 bassoons\n4 horns in F\n2 trumpets in B♭\n3 trombones: tenor, bass\nTuba\nTimpani\nTriangle\nCymbals\nSnare drum\nBass drum\nTubular bells\nTam tam\nGlockenspiel\nXylophone\nHarp\nStrings\n\n\n== Recording ==\nChandos Records: CHAN 5281 - Ichmouratov: Viola Concerto No.1/Piano Concerto; London Symphony Orchestra, Jean-Philippe Sylvestre piano, Airat Ichmouratov conductor\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe world premiere of the Piano Concerto took place in a sold-out concert and received generally favorable reviews. Emmanuel Bernier of Le Soleil wrote: \"The piano section offers significant advantages to the performer, featuring double octaves and expansive, harmonically rich chords. Ichmouratov, demonstrating adept orchestration skills, integrates the orchestra as an equal partner with its own distinct voice.\"\nThe recording of the Piano Concerto gained average-to-positive reviews. Michael Church of BBC Music Magazine wrote: \"Ichmouratov clearly loves what he can do in a pianissimo environment, teasing the listener into following intricate paths\". Gregor Tassie of MusicWeb International noted: \"Ichmouratov is a talented orchestrator, yet his music is devoid of originality\". Frédéric Cardin of Panm360 transcribed: \"...Ichmouratov's music very accessible, well written and often remarkably orchestrated\". Barry Forshaw of Classical Cd Choice wrote: \"The Volga-Tatar-born Canadian Airat Ichmouratov ably conducts the London Symphony Orchestra\" Geoff Perce of Classical Music Daily described Ichmouratov's music as \"colourful and free from pretence.\" Jean Lacroix of Crescendo Magazine wrote: \"...undeniable qualities in the field of orchestral treatment: demonstration and luxuriance, vitality and solemnity, expressiveness and melodic capacity.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAirat Ichmouratov - composer, official website\nJean-Philippe Sylvestre - pianist, official website\nComplete recording of the Piano Concerto  Jean-Philippe Sylvestre, piano; London Symphony Orchestra; Airat Ichmouratov conductor – Release Date: 16 June 2023",

        "content": "Daniel Angelo Marras was a Jesuit missionary in New Spain.\n\n\n== Biographies ==\nMarras was born in Cagliari, Sardinia.\nIn 1656, Marras was assigned to Mission San José de Mátape, where he founded a school for the religious education of native converts. Over the course of his tenure, Marras made Mátape into a commercial hotspot, and established cattle ranching in Sonora. Marras was also heavily involved in mining operations in Mátape, despite Jesuit rules forbidding such involvement. Under his management, two mines were established, manned by African slaves, and a refinery was founded to process the resulting ore. \nAs of 1685, Marras was vice provincial of the Jesuits in New Spain. He died in Mexico in 1689.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Van Wert County Airport (ICAO: KVNW, FAA LID: VNW) is a publicly owned, public use airport located 2 miles southwest of Van Wert in Van Wert County, Ohio. The airport is primarily a general aviation facility and serves small, privately owned aircraft.\nThe airport partners with Purdue University to be a satellite training facility for aviation, allowing students to earn credits towards a degree.\nThe airport hosts a regular fly in/cruise in with planes, cars, and motorcycles on display.\n\n\n== Facilities and aircraft ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe airport has two runways. Runway 9/27 measures 4,000 x 75 ft (1219 x 23 m) and is paved with asphalt; runway 18/36 measures 2558 x 95 ft (780 x 29 m) and is made of turf.\nThe airport has a county-operated fixed-base operator. It sells fuel, both Avgas and Jet A; offers services such as general maintenance, catering, hangars, courtesy transportation, and rental cars; and provides amenities such as conference rooms, pilot supplies, a crew lounge, snooze rooms, and showers.\n\n\n==== Facility Upgrades ====\nThe FBO's terminal building was upgraded in 2021, and its grand opening featured tours; airplane rides and tours; and more. The project cost $1.6 million and was built with private funds. New facilities included classrooms, a new lounge, and space to stay overnight.\nIn 2023, an airport expansion went up for debate, including a potential runway expansion in order to handle bigger jets. The airport is pursuing both public and private funding options to support the growth.\nLater in 2023, the airport received nearly $90,000 from the FAA to upgrade its lighting system. Relevant projects included reconstructing the runway lighting system, constructing a lighting vault to meet FAA standards, and installing replacement runway end identifier lights to make the airport more accessible by improving approaches to the runway.\n\n\n=== Aircraft ===\nFor the 12-month period ending September 24, 2020, the airport had 27,375 aircraft operations, an average of 75 per day; it was entirely general aviation. For the same time period, 22 aircraft were based at the airport: 20 single-engine airplanes, 1 multi-engine airplane, and 1 jet.\n\n\n== Accidents & incidents ==\nOn October 15, 2008, a Cessna 172 was damaged while taxiing at the Van Wert County Airport. The pilot was taxiing on grass parallel to the runway when the aircraft went into a ditch. The aircraft's tail and propeller were damaged. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane while taxiing on wet grass.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Old Hall Street is a road in Liverpool, England. Situated in the city centre, it runs between Leeds Street and Chapel Street and is part of Liverpool business district.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe street was one of the original seven streets that made up the medieval borough founded by King John in 1207, together with Water Street, Castle Street, Chapel Street, High Street, Tithebarn Street and Dale Street.\nThe 'old hall' that Old Hall Street gets its name from was originally on Mill Street, a street that dated back to the 13th century. Towards the end of the 17th century, and now known as Old Hall Street, it became a fashionable area for the merchants of the city and residencies were built on Old Hall Street during this period, stretching up towards St Paul's Square.\nThe original Cotton Exchange Building was situated on Old Hall Street, opening in 1906. The opening was performed by Prince and Princess of Wales and was attended by 3,000 guests. The front of the building was replaced with a modern façade between 1967 and 1969, which still stands today.\nSt Paul's Eye Hospital was originally sited on Pall Mall but moved to Old Hall Street in 1912. The hospital remained on Old Hall Street until 1992, when it moved to the Royal Liverpool Hospital.\nThe Liverpool Echo and Daily Post offices were situated on Old Hall Street from 1974 in the Post & Echo Building. The Liverpool Echo moved to its current home on St Paul's Square in 2018. Constructed at the same time as the Post & Echo Building, New Hall Place was built for Royal Insurance. The building is now used by the Home Office and RSA Insurance Group.\nThe closure of Liverpool Exchange railway station and the subsequent creation of Moorfields railway station saw an entrance to the new station open on Old Hall Street in May 1977.\n\n\n== Listed buildings ==\nOld Hall Street contains several Grade II listed buildings, including:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brotherhood economics (Japanese: 兄弟経済; Hepburn: Kyōdai Keizai) is a socio-economic concept associated with Toyohiko Kagawa, a Japanese Christian novelist and social reformer, and the author of the book Brotherhood Economics published in 1936. Influenced by his Christian faith and his aversion to warfare, critiqued prevailing political economies of his time—fascism, Soviet-style communism, and capitalism—for their concentration of wealth and power, which he  believed perpetuated poverty. He proposed an alternative model where Christian churches, cooperatives, and pacifist organizations collaborate to foster small, local economies grounded in cooperation.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nIn 1909, while studying at the Kobe Theological Seminary, Kagawa moved to Kobe's Shinkawa slums. Here, he engaged in relief work, aiding thousands of impoverished residents. He identified three major weaknesses among the residents: the physically weak, the mentally weak, and the morally weak. Therefore, a core aspect of his Christian mission involved establishing free medical clinics, educational facilities, and spaces for preaching the gospel.\nIn 1914, he traveled to the United States to enroll at Princeton Theological Seminary for three years, pursuing studies in divinity. While there he observed the nearby New York City slums and the workings of urban labor unions.\nKagawa returned to Japan and actively participated in peace initiatives, advocated for labor unions, promoted environmental conservation, and supported the movement for universal suffrage. He faced multiple arrests for his activities, which he viewed as obligations aligned with the principles of a Christian \"Good Samaritan.\" During his periods of imprisonment, Kagawa dedicated his time to writing.\nIn the early 1920s, Kagawa encountered disagreements with radical labor union leaders due to his assertion that spiritual reform must accompany authentic social and economic reform.\nAs he became more influenced by the gradualist ideas of British Guild Socialists and the cooperative movement of the Rochdale Weavers, he started advocating for cooperative economics as a favorable option compared to both communism and capitalism. In 1922, Kagawa declared himself as a \"Guild Socialist\" in terms of his political views, his approach is non-militant, and he could be described as a \"passivist,\" strictly adhering to peaceful methods.\nKagawa published \"Brotherhood Economics\" in 1936, wherein according to him he further develops the themes initially presented in four lectures titled \"Christian Brotherhood and Economic Reconstruction.\" at Colgate-Rochester Divinity School in April 1936.\n\n\n== Seven cooperatives types ==\nKagawa advocates for the establishment of seven types of cooperatives: health and life insurance, producers', marketing, credit, mutual aid, public utility, and consumers'. These cooperatives would serve as the foundation of the legislative body within the political state he envisions, emphasizing the necessity of Christian principles for its realization. He contends that without the development of a Christian brotherhood, an ideal economic society cannot be achieved, distinguishing his vision from socialism, communism, and capitalism's exploitative nature.\nKagawa stresses the need to base economic revolution on society as a whole rather than any specific segment, asserting that the labor movement alone cannot accomplish necessary economic reconstruction. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of a consumption system alongside production, suggesting that private ownership and enterprise could coexist with legislative intervention to safeguard the common good. While Kagawa's proposals include ambitious goals like eradicating corruption and relying on the spirit of the Cross to address economic challenges, he acknowledges the practical limitations and challenges associated with implementing cooperatives.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nIn 1921, Kagawa established the Kobe Consumer Co-operative and the Nada Consumer Co-operative in Kobe. Subsequently, these entities merged to form Co-op Kobe. Additionally, Kagawa was instrumental in founding numerous other cooperatives, including the Kyoto Consumer Co-operative, Tokyo Student's Consumer Co-operative, and Tokyo Iryou (Medical) Consumer Co-operative. Co-op Kobe currently has a membership of 65 million individuals and achieves an annual turnover exceeding $135 billion.\n\n\n=== Student housing ===\nThe inception of student co-ops traces back to Gainesville, Florida, and Austin, Texas, in the 1890s, initially as dining clubs. However, the concept of cooperative student housing gained traction during the Great Depression, spurred by economic hardships that prompted students to seek innovative solutions. A pivotal moment occurred with a speaking tour led by Japanese co-op advocate Toyohiko Kagawa, arranged by the student Christian movement. Kagawa's lectures on \"Brotherhood Economics,\" emphasizing the potential of cooperatives to foster social, political, and economic justice, resonated deeply at state universities in Berkeley, Los Angeles, Ann Arbor, and Toronto. These presentations inspired students to establish co-op housing organizations, which have since evolved to accommodate hundreds of students.\n\n\n=== Women's Cooperative Guilds in Nova Scotia ===\n\nIn the context of Atlantic Canada, the implementation of Brotherhood economics within cooperatives posed challenges for women, described by Mary Ellicott Arnold as a significant obstacle to navigate. Despite the inherently patriarchal structure of these institutions, some women were able to assert agency in fulfilling their own needs, a departure from the prevailing norm where women typically accepted what was offered to them. While these individual initiatives did not fully realize the cooperatives' vision of gender equality nor dismantle male dominance within the cooperatives, they did afford certain women the opportunity to exert degrees of social and economic influence within these structures.\n\n\n=== Toronto ===\nKagawa's op-op idea garnered significant popularity in North America. In the early thirties, the Kagawa Co-operating Committee, led by Richard Roberts, an interdenominational group of Canadian churchmen, was established in Toronto. This group, comprising about thirty individuals, frequently convened in retreats where they engaged in a blend of oriental meditation and prayer, both individually and collectively. Roberts communicated to Kagawa that their program was viewed as radical and experimental for Canadians, particularly given that no similar initiatives had been attempted within living memory in Protestant circles in Toronto.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToyohiko Kagawa\nChristian socialism\nCo-operative economics\nPacifism\nSocial economy\nDistributism\nSmall is beautiful\nChristianity in Japan\nMutual aid (organization theory)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKagawa, T.

It is expected that the audience in these cities will warmly welcome Brena and enjoy her hits.\nAlthough the current last part of the tour consists of a series of concerts in Zagreb, Croatia, at the Zagreb Arena, it is expected that Brena will announce new dates and cities as the tour progresses.\nThe \"Imam pesmu da vam pevam Tour\" shows that the popularity of Lepa Brena knows no bounds and that her music is still loved throughout the Balkans.\n\n\n== Set list ==\nThis setlist was obtained from the concert of October 20, 2018 held at Štark Arena in Belgrade. It does not represent all shows throughout the tour.\n\n\n== Shows ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In Greek mythology, Arethusa (; Ancient Greek: Ἀρέθουσα, romanized: Aréthousa) is a minor figure who became a lover of the sea-god Poseidon, before undergoing a transformation at the hands of Hera during a lost episode of Greek myth. She then became the spring of the same name in Chalcis.\nThe New Archaeological Museum of Chalcis was named 'Arethusa' after this legendary woman.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nArethusa's story is mostly known from a fragment of the Michigan papyrus (Papyrus Michigan, inv. no. 1447). The fragmentary Hellenistic text attributes the story to Hesiod, though it has been identified as part of the pseudo-Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, an epic poem written around the seventh or sixth century BC. The fragment, as restored by Reinhold Merkelbach and Martin Litchfield West, reads:\n\nἈρέθουσα θυγάτηρ μὲν Ὑπέρ[ο]υ, Π[οσ]ει[δῶνι δὲ συν]ελθοῦσα κατὰ τὸν Βοϊκὸν Εὔρειπον [εἰς κρήνην] ἠλλάγη ἐν Χ[αλκίδι] ὑπὸ [τῆς] Ἥρας, ὡς Ἡσίοδος ἱστορε[ῖ\nAccording to the damaged text, Arethusa was the daughter of Hyperes, though it does not clarify whether this is Hyperes of Troezen or Hyperes of Boeotia. It further says that this Arethusa slept by the shore of the Euripus Strait (in Euboea) with a man whose name is not preserved, but which starts with 'P' and contains the diphthong 'ei'; it is generally accepted that this is meant to read 'Poseidon' (as Merkelbach and West restored). The theory is supported by the works of Hyginus and Stephanus of Byzantium, who wrote that Poseidon and Arethusa became the parents of the hero Abas, as well as Hesychius of Alexandria, who wrote that one of Poseidon's epithets was Euripios. Euboea was often called Abantis after Abas.\nFollowing her tryst with Poseidon, Arethusa was then transformed by the goddess Hera at Chalcis, the principal city of Euboea. The fragment however makes no mention of what Hera transformed Arethusa into, or why. The presence of a spring called Arethusa in Chalcis leads to the deduction that Arethusa was changed into this spring, like other women in Greek mythology bearing the same name were.\nHera's motivations are harder to decipher. There are two possibilities behind her motive; either Hera did so in order to punish Arethusa over an unknown offence, or perhaps it was an act of mercy. Given that Arethusa's lover was Poseidon, and not Hera's husband Zeus, marital infidelity can be ruled out as the reason. It is possible that Arethusa made a hubristic remark against Hera or dared to compare herself to the queen of the gods. Alternatively, if Hera's motivation was sympathy and mercy, perhaps she did so to save Arethusa from some hardship or threat she was facing, like Athena did with Corone.\nArethusa's son Abas named his daughter Arethusa after his mother.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe myth of Arethusa is an aetiological one, as its primary role is to explain the presence of the Arethusa spring in Chalcis. According to ancient authors, the clear waters of the spring were favoured by eels in particular, which were considered sacred. Moreover, it also establishes the reason behind the cults of Hera and Euripius Poseidon at Chalcis. The myth might have also been used to establish a genealogical link between Boeotia and Euboea, two regions that enjoyed great affinity in antiquity, if Arethusa's father is taken to be Hyperes of Boeotia, who was himself a son of Poseidon by the Pleiad Alcyone.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHyria\nArethusa (Ithaca)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArjona-Perez, Manuel (2017). \"Η Αρέθουσα, ο Ποσειδώνας και η Ήρα.

She served during World War II and then led Ascham School in Sydney and Firbank Girls' Grammar School in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWhitehead was born in 1908 in Geelong. Her parents had both been born in Australia. Her mother was Jessie (born Brown) and her father, James Whitehead, was a clerk. She graduated from the University of Melbourne as a qualified teacher but instead of teaching she worked as a secretary before the war. She was an army officer during the second world war after initially enrolling as a stenographer. She served from 1942 to 1945 and she became a lieutenant and temporary major. After the war she went into teaching and she received her master's degree from her alma mater in 1945.\nSydney's Ascham School had adopted the Dalton Plan in 1922 under the direction of Headmistress Margaret Bailey. The next head who served the school for several years was Whitehead. In 1955 she was elected to serve as the President of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools for a year.\nWhitehead continued with the Dalton Plan at Ascham until in 1961, when she became the head of Firbank Girls' Grammar School in Melbourne. She served until 1970 and during her time the students were allowed more freedom. She continued with using the Dalton Plan at Firbank. She replaced exams with tests and removed the streaming of students. New buildings were introduced for physical education and to increase the boarding facility.\nWhitehead died in 1976 in Malvern.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

From 1710 to 1718, he taught philosophy at the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro, taking his final vows on February 2, 1715.\nIn 1720, Cañas was assigned to Mission Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Arizpe, and by 1722 he was Father Visitor of the Jesuits in Sonora. Other Jesuits frequently consulted Cañas as a legal expert. Cañas clashed with Captain Gregorio Álvarez Tuñón y Quirós for a decade leading up to the latter's death in 1728.\nBy 1730, Cañas was serving at Mission San Pedro Aconchi. There, he warned about curanderos, writing that \"the devil talks to [them] in the form of a jaguar, puma, dog, or, most commonly, in the form of a snake.\" In 1735, he was appointed rector of the Jesuit College in Durango.\nAccounts by Carlos de Roxas, another Jesuit missionary, describe Cañas as tormented by \"unnatural\" suffering under the spell of a shaman for the last two years of his life. Cañas died on May 9, 1740.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "PT Jaminan Kredit Indonesia (Jamkrindo) is a part of one of Indonesia's state-owned enterprises and is a component of PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Indonesia Financial Group), operating in the field of credit guarantee, both conventional and sharia. It is the only state-owned enterprise tasked with providing guarantees.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1970, the Indonesian government established the Cooperative Credit Guarantee Institution (LJKK) at a time when cooperatives were still lagging behind state-owned and private enterprises. At that time, LJKK provided limited guarantee services, namely for the TRI Program credit guarantee, Padi Palawija credit, and Fertilizer Procurement credit.\nIn its development, LJKK transformed into the Public Company for Cooperative Financial Development (Perum PKK) to expand its service coverage. It no longer focused solely on cooperatives but extended its services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This change was established through Government Regulation No. 51 of 1981, which was later refined by Government Regulation No. 27 of 1985.\nIn 2000, Perum PKK underwent another transformation into Perum SPU (Business Development Facility) through Government Regulation No. 95 of 2000. This transformation aimed to realize guarantee activities covering bank or non-bank credits, guarantees for leasing financing, factoring, consumer financing, profit-sharing financing, installment purchases, service contract transactions, profit-sharing guarantee issuance, management and consulting assistance, surety bond issuance, and other guarantee activities.\n\nIn 2008, with the issuance of Government Regulation No. 41 of 2008, Perum SPU changed its name to Perum Jaminan Kredit Indonesia (Perum Jamkrindo). This change was made because it no longer provided direct guarantees to MSMEs through profit-sharing schemes but focused on MSME credit guarantee businesses. Subsequently, in the same year, the government issued Presidential Regulation No. 2 of 2008 regarding Guarantee Institutions and Minister of Finance Regulation No. 222/PMK.010/2008 regarding Credit Guarantee Companies and Credit Re-Guarantee Companies, which positioned Perum Jamkrindo as a company required to obtain a business license as a credit guarantee company. Then, through Minister of Finance Decision No. KEP-77/KM.10/2009, Perum Jamkrindo's business license as a credit guarantee company was determined.\nIn 2020, President Joko Widodo changed the legal entity of Perum Jamkrindo to a limited liability company. This change was established through Government Regulation No. 11 of 2020 concerning the Change of Legal Entity Form of the Public Company (Perum) Jaminan Kredit Indonesia into a Limited Liability Company (Persero). This transformation was made to meet the requirements for entry into the insurance and guarantee holding company and as a business consideration to enable strategic decisions to be made more quickly compared to when it was still in the form of a Public Company.\nIn April 2020, Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Erick Thohir appointed PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Bahana) as the parent company (holding) for state-owned insurance and guarantee companies. The establishment of this holding company was enacted through Government Regulation No. 20 of 2020 concerning the Addition of State Capital Participation of the Republic of Indonesia into the Equity of the Limited Liability Company (Persero) PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia, signed by President Joko Widodo on March 16, 2020. Under this legal framework, PT Jamkrindo officially came under the umbrella of Bahana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nOfficial website (in Indonesian and English)",

        "content": "Carliol House is a Grade II listed building in Newcastle upon Tyne that curved the corner of Market Street East and Pilgrim Street in the city-centre. As of 2024 only the façade of the building remains.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe 7-storey Art Deco building was constructed in the between 1924 and 1927 to be the new headquarters of the North Eastern Electric Supply Company. It was designed by John James Burnet, Thomas S. Tait and Francis Lorne with L J Couves & Partners. The façade of the building uses Portland stone features and classical detailing as well as a plaque commemorating local developer of the incandescent light bulb, Joseph Swan. The internal structure of the building used a steel frame and the doorcase was granite and Frosterley Marble. A dome was at the top of the building. The building featured electric lifts, heating and a central vacuum plant for cleaning. The building also housed the offices of Merz & McLellan.\n\n\n== Recent history ==\nThe building gained listed grade II status on 29 March 1987. In the 2010s the building had been used as a branch of sportswear retailer, Start Fitness. Despite objections from Historic Buildings & Places among others the building was given the go-ahead to be largely demolished in the early 2020s. The building had been called \"one of the city's finest buildings\".\nIn August 2023, the demolition of the interior of the building was completed whilst retaining the 130 meter long façade. Building work will continue on the larger site, now called the Pigrim's Quarter, until 2025. The development headed up by David and Simon Reuben is part of a £155 million redevelopment scheme. In 2027 the building project will be handed over to HM Revenue and Customs who will be relocating 9000 staff from the Benton Park View site outside of the city centre.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Khwaja Muhammad Ahmad Samdani (1932 – 11 April 2013) was a Pakistani judge who served on the Lahore High Court bench.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSamdani was born in 1932 in Kareem Nagar, Hyderabad Deccan, and his family migrated to Pakistan after the partition of India in 1947. After completing his education, he taught at Islamia College Peshawar before joining the civil service and later transitioning to the judiciary. He also pursued an LLM at Yale University on a scholarship.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1972, Samdani was appointed as an additional judge at the Lahore High Court.\nIn 1974, during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's tenure as Prime Minister, anti-Ahmadiyya violence erupted in Pakistan. Samdani chaired the Rabwah Tribunal, which investigated the violence that took place on 29 May 1974. Although the full report of the tribunal was not made public, it is noted that Justice Samdani considered the Second Constitutional Amendment, which declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, to be a form of persecution against a vulnerable minority.\nIn a bail in the Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri murder case against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, he granted bail to Bhutto despite pressure from the military government led by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Samdani's decision was seen as a display of judicial independence and impartiality.\nIn April 1980, while serving as the federal law secretary, Samdani had a confrontation with Zia-ul-Haq over remarks the general had made about secretaries. Samdani stood his ground and refused to apologise, believing in the correctness of his actions.\nIn 1981, Samdani was presented with a new oath containing clauses he deemed unconstitutional. Rather than comply with these clauses, he chose to retire from his position.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Borówno Lake is a reservoir lake located in the Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship, on the Świecka Upland, in the Bydgoszcz County, in Gmina Dobrcz, approximately 9 km north of the city limits of Bydgoszcz.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe lake has an oval shape. A forest complex adjoins it from the northwest, while on the eastern shore, there is a complex of holiday homes. To the south lies the village of Borówno, from which the lake takes its name. In the forest adjacent to the north, there is the Augustowo nature reserve, protecting a peatland, alder carr, and a habitat of swamp willow. Two similar lakes, Kusowo and Dobrcz, connect to the north of the lake.\nThe lake basin has a regular shape sloping towards the center, with one central depression measuring 14 m in depth. The lake bed surface below the 12.5-meter isobath constitutes 21% of the total lake area. Small and shallow bays have formed at both ends of the lake. The total length of the shoreline is 3.96 km.\nThe littoral zone of the lake occupies 38% of the entire reservoir area. The marginal bays are entirely covered with stonewort meadows. Common stonewort dominates, accompanied to a lesser extent by species such as Eurasian watermilfoil, lesser bulrush, and Charetum fragilis.\n\n\n== Drainage basin ==\nThe lake is fed by small, intermittent watercourses and essentially constitutes a closed basin, strongly reacting (along with the neighboring reservoirs of Kusowo and Dobrcz) to changes in rainfall conditions. Therefore, in 1978, an artificial drainage system was built for the lake, which, through a pumping station, can divert excess water to the Augustowski stream. However, due to the usually low water levels in the lake, this system is rarely utilized.\nThe direct drainage basin of the lake coincides with the total drainage basin, covering an area of 19.43 km2. Its area encompasses the bifurcation part of the post-glacial tunnel valley, running northeast to southwest. Its western part is drained by the Augustowski stream, which flows into the Kotomierzyca river, a left-bank tributary of the Brda river, while in its northeastern fragment, the Niewieściński stream, which flows into the Vistula river, begins its course. The land use structure of the drainage basin is as follows:\n\nagricultural land: 71% of the total drainage basin;\nforests: 19%;\nother 10% (mostly marshes and floodplains near lakes Kusowo and Dobrcz).\nThe total drainage basin of the lake includes two water reservoirs: Kusowo Lake (48 ha), Dobrcz Lake (24 ha), and an accompanying floodplain covering an area of 24 ha.\nThe waters of Borówno Lake have limited hydraulic contact with groundwater, resulting in groundwater recharge contributing only a small percentage to the overall water balance of the reservoir.\nThe direct drainage basin of the lake is characterized by numerous recreational buildings in the form of a complex of 350 allotment gardens, which constitute a significant source of anthropogenic pressure.\n\n\n== Water quality ==\nBorówno Lake is characterized by average, second-degree susceptibility of waters to degradation. Unfavorable features of the lake's drainage basin include land use dominated by agriculture and a low elongation index value, indicating weak dilution capacity of pollutants from outside sources.\nWater stratification amounts to 11.3%, suggesting favorable conditions for the development of high primary production. This facilitates the entry of nutrients into the eutrophic zone of the lake. This is also favored by the existence of prolonged anaerobic conditions.\nWater quality studies of the lake have been conducted since 1984. In 1986 and 1992, the water was classified as Class II purity, although subsequent studies showed a gradual deterioration in water quality. A study from 2002 recorded Class III water purity. Against this background, the trophic indicators of the lake were favorable, such as water transparency (about 2.5 m, and over 3 m in summer) and chlorophyll content. Cesspits located in allotment gardens on the eastern shore of the lake have a negative impact on the water quality of Borówno Lake. A study conducted in 2009 by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Bydgoszcz showed good water quality in the reservoir.\nTrophically, the lake belongs to the transitional meso-eutrophic type.\n\n\n== Fishing ==\nThe Polish Fishing Association is the lessee of Borówno Lake. The fishing management is conducted in a manner characteristic of tourist-utilized lakes. Only controlled catches are carried out on this body of water, targeting common bream, common roach, and European perch.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\nBorówno Lake is one of the two closest recreational areas to the city of Bydgoszcz, thus serving important recreational functions for its residents. It is estimated that during the summer season, on weekends, around 5,000 to 6,000 people relax by its shores. Access from the city side is convenient via the national road 5 Bydgoszcz-Gdańsk. It is the nearest recreational lake for the residents of the Fordon district.\nOn the eastern side of the reservoir, there are recreational plots, while on the western, wooded shore, there are two beaches (one guarded), along with piers, playgrounds, and a water sports equipment rental. There is also a recreational center and camping areas. Wild beaches also exist on the southern, northern, and eastern shores of the reservoir.\nThe history of the urban swimming area by the lake dates back to 1968. The center near the village of Borówno expanded the Municipal Sports, Tourism, and Recreation Center, while further south, a center belonging to the Pomeranian Military District was established. These centers were expanded in the 1970s, and after 1990, they were renovated and modernized.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

She was educated in Vilnius, after which she went into exile and frequented Russian revolutionary circles, meeting her husband Aleksandr Ge and joining the Bolshevik Party. Following the February Revolution, Ksenia and her husband returned to Russia, settling in Moscow, where they worked for the party. After the October Revolution, Ge moved to Kislovodsk, where she worked as a senior investigator for the Cheka, and as head of the People's Commissariat of Health.\nDuring the White offensive in the Northern Caucasus, Ksenia participated in the defense of Kislovodsk, but facing an overwhelming White force, the Red Army soon fled the city. Ge decided to remain behind, in order to care for her sick daughter, who would have been unable to leave with them. She also persuaded her husband, Aleksandr Ge, to stay with them. On 20 January [O.S. 7 January] 1919, Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army captured Kislovodsk and brought the city under the White Terror. On 21 January, Ge's husband was killed by the Whites while covering the retreat of Chekists fleeing the city. The following day, Ksenia herself was arrested. She was detained in a hotel room, together with her daughter. \n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn 23 January, she was sentenced to be hanged by a military tribunal. She managed to escape that same night, disguised in a burka and a papakha, and fled to Yessentuki on foot, leaving behind her sleeping daughter and a letter addressed to her mother and late husband. She took refuge with a local doctor, but he gave her up to the Whites, in return for a bounty of 50,000 rubles. Ge was taken back to Kislovodsk, where, on 24 January 1919, she was hanged on Cossack Hill. Her daughter continued to face torture by the Whites; a hotel manager attempted to rescue her, but she died soon after.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\nIn 1957, a monument to Ksenia Ge, sculpted by Khamzat Krymshamkhalov, was erected in Kislovodsk. On 19 August 2018, the monument was vandalised with graffiti, which spelled the name of Andrei Shkuro, a member of the White movement and later the SS Cossacks of Nazi Germany, who became a popular figure in extremist Russian nationalist circles.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBuldakov, Vladimir P.

        "content": "1976 Dir revolt refers to a rebellion by Kohistani tribesmen against the government of Pakistan from 3 September to 10 September 1976. The rebellion was suppressed and stabilised government control over the area.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDir was a Princely state under the British suzerainty and after the Partition of India, it became part of Pakistan. It's autonomy was reduced in 1955 and after a coup by Pakistani special forces in 1960, the area came under de facto Pakistani control. In 1969, the state of dir was officially abolished and it was fully incorporated into Pakistan. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto started a land reform project in which large sections of timber forest was confiscated. It was a vital source of income for the locals and they stated protesting against the reform.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\nThe rebellion initially started as a protest by the local tribesmen in the Shongan valley south of Dir. In an effort to disperse the protesters, Dir Levies started firing tear gas shells on the protesters. Upon hearing the sound of shelling, multiple tribesmen including Suktankhel and Paidankhel tribesmen carrying melee weapons from the surrounding areas also entered the battlefield and started attacking the troops of Dir Levies. The situation soon went out of the control of Dir Levies. The tribesmen had blockaded the main road to Dir city and they had put the town under siege. They looted multiple military weapons storehouses, destroyed a government hospital, and lowered Pakistani flags replacing them with the flags of Dir. The Pakistani government decided to deploy the Pakistan army and Pakistan Air Force to quell the rebellion. 10,000 troops of Pakistan army entered the area. They faced heavy resistance from the 2000 tribesmen. A team of Pakistani military engineers was ambushed by the tribesmen. Infantry alone failed to quell the rebellion, and so tanks and artillery were used extensively. Sniper positions were established on multiple mountains. Similarly Pakistani Air Force's Sabres also launched multiple air strikes on the tribesmen. Pakistani casualties were about 120 while the casualties for the tribesmen numbered at around 180. The military succeeded in suppressing the rebellion on 10 September.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto visited the area after the rebellion. He expressed sorrow at the loss of life and blamed it on the irresponsible behaviour of Dir Levies. The land reforms went through without further problem.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2024-05-12 12:53:44",
        "content": "Tomasz Szmydt (Polish pronunciation: [tɔmaʃ ʃmɨt]; born 27 April 1970 in Białystok, eastern Poland) is a Polish jurist, employed as a judge in the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw. He adjudicated in the law court's second department on access to classified information in regard of members of the Polish military and intelligence. \nOn 1 May 2024, via Turkey, he defected to Belarus, where he applied for political asylum to 'temporarily rest [...] in an open and friendly country.' The judge most likely was extracted from Poland by the Belarusian security forces. Szmydt would have rather defected to Russia, but due to the short-visit visa waiver for Polish citizens to enter Belarus, he chose the latter country to avoid raising the Polish Foreign Intelligence Agency's suspicions. On 6 May 2024, the Belarusian state-owned governmental news agency BelTA held a press conference in Minsk, during which Szmydt praised the Belarusian authorities, proposing that Belarus is ‘a country with great potential,’ headed by ‘a very wise leader.’ Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, reciprocated; dubbing the fugitive judge 'a brave man' Szmydt later explained that he fled to Belarus in order to 'protest to the Polish authorities who under the influence of the US and the UK are leading the country to war.' \nAt this conference, Szmydt presented his signed letter of resignation from the post of a judge in the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw. The Regional Court announced that they were unaware of this letter, while Szmydt was on his annual leave through 10 May 2024. On 7 May 2024, the Regional Court initiated disciplinary proceedings regarding the judge's case. In reply to the request lodged by National Public Prosecutor's Office (Prokuratura Krajowa), on 9 May 2024, the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland waived the judge's immunity. Furthermore, the Supreme Administrative Court also accepted the judge's public resignation. As a result Szmydt ceased being a judge.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe unprecedented situation is assessed in Poland by the authorities and mass media as treason. Szmydt is lambasted as a 'traitor.' The Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski and Poland’s National Security Bureau (BBN) chief pl:Jacek Siewiera consent, the strong suspicion being that this defection is already used for the sake of Russia's hybrid warfare against the West. This suspicion rests on Szmydt's appeal to Polish politicians that they should ‘resume dialog with [Belarusian] President Lukashenko and Russia.’ The Kremlin's leading propagandist Vladimir Solovyov also invited Szmydt to his primetime program, in which the judge participated twice. Apart from facing potential criminal charges, recently Szmydt was deciding on state functionaries' access to top secret NATO and EU documents. Now Szmydt hopes to meet President Lukashenko in person and work as a politician or geopolitical analyst in Belarus. Meanwhile, it transpired that the judge had sojourned in Belarus in June 2023 evoking no reaction on the part of the Polish counterintelligence. Even more worryingly, between 2019 and 2023, Szmydt sojourned in Ukraine 'tens of times' with no official oversight or explanation.\nAfter the initial shock, the reactions in Poland resulted in further polarization of the political scene. Accusations are traded between the current pro-democratic government and the formerly ruling Law and Justice party (now in opposition) on who is responsible for Szmydt's recruitment to provide intelligence to Russia and Belarus. It is one of effects that the Russian propaganda seeks to achieve in a targeted democratic country, namely, 'exacerbating polarisation,' with an eye to 'to undermine democracy.'\n\n\n=== Russian and Belarusian propaganda coverage ===\nAs reported by the propaganda-led Russian and Belarusian mass media, on 7 May 2024, Szmydt changed the presumable cause of his defection, citing the danger of 'physical liquidation' in Poland. A day later, he added that upon return to Poland he would be incarcerated on trumped up changes, or would be assassinated in a staged motoring accident or suicide. Hence, Szmydt also asked for the Belarusian president's protection, which should also be extended over his relatives, who remain in Poland. Furthermore, Szmydt requested the Belarusian authorities to deliver to the Polish Ambassy in Minsk his letter of resignation from the law court in Warsaw. In line with the Russian propaganda's typical modus operandi, the presumed causes of Szmydt's defection are multiplied. Among others, it is proposed, the judge was persecuted for 'telling the truth to power,'  that an official probe into his spying for Belarus was imminent, which could result in incarceration, that he maintained 'our Slavic peoples can live in harmony', that he 'refused to hate the Russians,' or that he was compelled to adjudicate in 'breach of his civic conscience.'\nAfter discussing the 'causes' of his defection, the Minsk and Moscow propagandists began extracting from Szmydt normative judgements about Poland. The judge proposed that 'the Polish authorities behave abnormally,' 'Poland is not an independent country,' or that 'Polish politicians politicians represent the interests of the United States and the United Kingdom.' He also agreed that Poland's political system is similar to that of Nazi Germany, and stated that it is more authoritarian than what is observed in Belarus and Russia.\nSubsequently, the Belarusian and Russian propaganda began stylizing Szmydt as a 'dissident.' On 8 May 2024, Szmydt gave an interview to the Blearusian branch of Russia's propaganda Sputnik news agency, wearing on the lapel a large ribbon of Saint George, or the present-day Kremlin's preferred symbol of Russian militarism ('patriotism'), imperialism and the ongoing war against Ukraine. On the other hand, he announced that the Polish population at large 'do not want to fight against Russia, Belarus or Ukraine.' In this context, it is not surprising that on 9 May 2024, Szmydt 'revealed' he was sure that the Polish authorities were getting ready to send to Belarus assassins with the task of liquidating the judge. Yet, it is the Russian government's preferred method of 'dealing' with oponents and defectors. But to lend some credibility to Szmydt's claim, Lukashenko personally assigned a security detail to the fugitive judge. The Belarusian president also promised to consider Szmydt's application for political asylum in Belarus.\nOn 9 May 2024, that is, the Victory Day (or the most important state holiday in Russia and Belarus), this propaganda coverage reached crescendo. Lukashenko devoted much of his speech to Szmydt. The Belarusian president claimed that Szmydt is not a Belarusian (or Russian) agent but a Polish 'patriot,' who 'tells the truth about what is going on in Poland.' Lukashenko added that Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed interest in the case of this fugitive judge from Poland.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1996 Tomasz Szmydt graduated with a degree in law from the Białystok branch of the University of Warsaw. He began his work as a jurist in the County Court (Sąd rejonowy) in Ciechanów, where he was nominated to the post of a judge (sędzia) in 2001. In 2009 he was to the post of a judge in the District Court (Sąd okręgowy) in Płock. In 2011, Szmydt continued his career as a judge in the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw. On 8 May 2017, the judge was seconded to the Polish Ministry of Justice. When this secondment came to an end, Deputy Minister of Justice pl:Łukasz Piebiak prolonged it and sent Szmydt to join the National Council of the Judiciary (Polish: Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa, KRS). Szmydt speaks native-level Russian.\nThe mass media remind that Szmydt's defection to Belarus is similar to that of pl:Emil Czeczko. Facing criminal charges, this soldier desrted and fled to Belarus in late 2021. The Belarusian authorities paraded him as a 'proof' of the country's stringent observance of human rights, before the soldier's unexplained death in 2022.\n\n\n=== During PiS government ===\n\nIn 2018, Szmydt became a member of the Polish Minister of Justice's team for ‘optimizing’ the system of judicial disciplinary actions. In this capacity, as a member judge of the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), Szmydt participated in the undermining the body's legal indpendence as part of the broader process of undemrining the state of law in Poland during the Law and Justice party's rule (2015-2023). In 2019 the judge filed a baseless report to the Central Anticorruption Bureau (Centralne Biuro Antykorupcyjne, CBA) against journalist Eva Ivanova who had investigated the undermining of the rule of law in the judiciary system.\nIn 2019, it was revealed that Szmydt, together with his wife Emilia Szmydt, was a key person (see the diagram) in the WhatsApp private group Kasta (Polish for ‘caste’), composed of pro-government judges and journalists. In conjunction with the then Polish Deputy Minister of Justice Piebiak, this group organized, carried out and oversaw the carrying out of social media and online actions of hate speech mobilization and discreditation (character assassination) against independent judges and those who opposed the Law and Justice (PiS) government's breaches of the Polish Constitution. The then ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party protected Szmydt and other Kasta members from prosecution. In this capacity Poland's de facto ruler (in 2015-2023) Jarosław Kaczyński corresponded with Szmydt's wife.\nNow, the suspicion is that Russia's intelligence service controlled the Kasta, as part of a broader network of Russian (and Belarusian) secret agents in Poland and across Europe. Szmydt's superior Piebiak announced that the former was a Russian spy, and added that Russian spies had infiltrated the Polish judiciary. Polish intelligence specialists confirm this conclusion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Turgut Göle (1913–2002) was a Turkish politician from the Republican People's Party (CHP) and served at the Parliament and also, at the Senate. He left the CHP and joined the Republican Reliance Party in 1967. Before his political career he worked as a district governor and then, a lawyer.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in Ardahan, Ottoman Empire, in 1913. His family was originally from Dedeşen village of Göle district, Ardahan. His sister was married to Münir Hüsrev Göle, a politician.\nAfter graduating from Istanbul High School in 1934, he obtained a degree from the Faculty of Political Sciences at Ankara University in 1937. Then he earned his Master of Arts degree at Indiana University, USA.  \nGöle also received a degree in law from Ankara University in the early 1950s. \n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his return to Turkey Göle worked at various public institutions, including the General Directorate of Security. Then he served as the district governor of Hafik (18 October 1943–17 February 1944), Çubuk, Gündoğmuş and Gölbaşı. From 1953 he worked as a freelance lawyer. Next he was elected as a deputy from the CHP representing Kars and served at Parliament during the X. term between 2 May 1954 and 1 November 1957. He also won his seat from Kars serving at the Parliament's XI. term from 1 November 1957 to 27 May 1960. Göle was one of the signatories of a declaration issued on 4 September 1957 which demanded the detailed inclusion of the fundamental rights and freedoms in the constitution, the establishment of a Constitutional Court and the adoption of the bicameral system. The other signatories of the statement included İsmet İnönü, Fevzi Lütfi Karaosmanoğlu, Fuat Arna, Kasım Gülek, Enver Güreli, Ahmet Bilgin, İbrahim Öktem and Nurettin Ardıçoğlu.  \nGöle was a member of the Turkish Group at the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe for two terms from 29 April 1957 to 1 May 1958 and from 19 September 1962 to 1 May 1963.\nFollowing the military coup on 27 May 1960 the rule of the Democrat Party ended, and a Constituent Assembly was formed. Göle was made a member of the Assembly on 6 January 1961 and held the post until 25 October 1961. He was elected as a senator for the CHP in October 1961 from Kars and served at the Senate until 7 June 1964. He was expelled from the party for one year in 1963 due to his alleged contact with Talat Aydemir who was the leader of a failed military coup. In the same incident other CHP politicians, including Nihat Erim, Avni Doğan and Kasım Gülek, were also expelled from the party. \nIn the general election of 1965 Göle was again elected as a deputy for the CHP from Kars. He left the CHP in 1967 and was involved in the establishment of the Republican Reliance Party led by Turhan Feyzioğlu. Göle was elected as a member of the party's administrative board in the second congress held in Ankara on 28 October 1970.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nGöle was married to the sister of Ali Bozer and Yüksel Bozer, former president of Hacettepe University. He had two children: Nilüfer Göle and Celal Göle. \nGöle died on 31 January 2002. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Recapture of Tarapacá or Siege of Tarapacá was a confrontation between Bolivian occupation forces under the command of Colonel José María García and Peruvian militias under the command of Major Juan Buendía within the framework of the War between Peru and Bolivia between January 6 and 7, 1842. Peruvian victory allowed us to recover the province of Tarapacá, which had been captured by Bolivian troops days before.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1841, the president of Peru, Agustín Gamarra, attempted to annex Bolivia (colonial Upper Peru), an undertaking that cost him his life by Peruvian Army on November 18 of that same year in the Battle of Ingavi. The Bolivian army under the command of General José Ballivián invades Peru, occupying Moquegua and Puno and immediately sending Col. Rodríguez Magariños, chief of the second Bolivian division to occupy Tacna and Arica, which said Bolivian chief carried out in December 1841. On January 2 of the following year, a column of one hundred Bolivian soldiers, under the command of Colonel José María García and his second, Commander Juan Montero, 3 occupies the town of Tarapacá, converting the Cabildo house into barracks for his troops, the Peruvian sub-prefect Calixto Gutiérrez de La Fuente retires to Iquique carrying the news of the occupation of the Bolivian troops. In said city he contacted Major Juan Buendía y Noriega who organized a column of militiamen with the residents of the port of Iquique and emigrants from Tacna, thus setting off for Tarapacá on January 5, 1842.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOnce the forces were recomposed, Major Juan Buendía left Iquique with a column of volunteers towards Tarapacá , fighting on the night of January 6 with the help of residents of the provincial capital, a fight that lasted until seven in the morning on next day. However, what actually happened is that Buendía, before starting a fight, settled in the La Peña nitrate office, following to the letter the strategy designed by the subprefect, apparently days before the invasion. In this nitrate mine he not only gathered men and weapons, but on January 4 and 5 he dispatched armed groups to harass the occupation forces day and night. This procedure aimed at weakening the invading forces was so successful that the Bolivian colonel José María García asked his superiors to send infantry and cavalry troops in order to confront them:\n\"Se hallan mucho dispersos y los va reuniendo el comandante Juan D. Buendía a distancia de catorce leguas llamada La Peña, y este señor van dos noches que me tiene abrumado con sus tiros, con los doce de caballería que tiene, y como están bien montados no les puedo hacer nada, y si tuviese ya la mitad de la caballería, podría tomarlos como también toda la caballada; pues con los que tengo no puedo perseguirlos una sola cuadra porque en su vida han manejado el arma, y quizás los más de ellos no la han conocido. Esto es que me hallo con hombres armados y en inacción\".\nAtte. Cnel. José María García. (El Comercio, 22/01/1842, page 4)\".\nThus, the date and time chosen to repel the invaders was due to intelligently articulated planning a Bolivian troop without sleep for two nights in a row, also without rest and poorly fed for the same period. The account of the combat by Juan Buendía himself was issued in the following terms:\nA mi aproximación a Tarapacá, se me reunió bastante gente aunque con pocas armas. Ello es que el 6 a las 11 de la noche estuve frente al enemigo que ocupaba una posición casi inexpugnable; favorecido de la cual me rompió un vivo fuego que fue contestado por los nuestros con no menor ardor por lo que al poco rato me encontré sin municiones, mas el entusiasmo del pueblo remedió esta falta, pues mientras nos batíamos, ellos construían cartuchos con los que me sostuve hasta las 7 de la mañana del 7, habiendo habido toda la noche un fuego sin interrupción. Los paisanos que tenía sin armas hice fuesen a tirar piedras con hondas y galgas al enemigo desde un cerro que domina la casa que ocupaban; y se llenaron tanto de terror que a la hora dicha se me rindieron a discreción quedando muerto el coronel García jefe de la fuerza invasora; mal herido el mayor Coloma hermano de mi compadre, y 9 individuos de tropa. Nuestra pérdida consiste en la muerte de un soldado y 5 heridos\n(El Comercio, 01/22/1842, page 3).\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nAt six in the morning, Colonel José María García was mortally wounded, ordering Commander Montero to fight until the last cartridge. An hour later, the Bolivian garrison, without ammunition and heavily decimated, surrendered at his discretion and had to proceed to return the town of Tarapacá to its joyful inhabitants. and brave inhabitants.\nAs an interesting fact, it should be added that the brave Tarapacan priest who managed to obtain the lead for the shots of the heroes of the local resistance, was still alive at the time when Ricardo Palma immortalized the entertaining story in his famous book on the Tradiciones Peruanas.\nThe Peruvian victory made it possible to recover the province and frustrate part of the Bolivian arrogance for its territorial conquests, before the advent of peace.\nColonel José María García perished in the fight. 40 soldiers and 5 officers were prisoners they would later be executed, the captured weapons were distributed among the neighbors and the Bolivian troops did not attempt to advance on Tarapacá again.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palace de la Belle Rivière (French: Palais de la Belle Rivière) is a former palace in Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, in the Artibonite department of Haiti. It is also known as the ‘’palace of 365 doors’’ (French: Palais de 365 portes or French: Palais de trois cent soixante-cinq portes). Although, it has not 365 doors. The palace was built for the first and last king of Haiti, Henri Christophe I. It overlooks the city center and the Artibonite River. Today, the palace ruins are in poor condition and deteriorating.\nOne kilometre east of the palace is the Crête-à-Pierrot fortress, where there was a major battle of the Haitian Revolution in March 1802.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Palais de la Belle Rivière was built in 1820 by Louis Dupeyrac to serve as a royal residence for king Henri Christophe, next to his residence in Milot, the Sans-Souci Palace. It was still under construction, when the Kingdom of Haiti fell in 1820 due to revolution and the king suffering a stroke. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide—according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet. Therefore, the palace was never completed, and the intended second floor was not realized.\nHenri Christophe I constructed the palace to consolidate his power in the vast and rich agricultural Artibonite region, which bordered to the republic of South Haiti, which was ruled by General Alexandre Pétion. Henri was known for his construction works: He built six châteaux, eight palaces and the massive Citadel Henri, now known as Citadelle Laferrière, on a mountain near Milot. The Sans-Souce palace was his most famous palace. Although in ruins today, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Palace has a rectangular plan, 68 metres long and 11 metres wide. Its west facade is backed by a vast rotunda, 12 meters in diameter. The walls of the palace are made of stone masonry and clay bricks bonded with lime mortar.\nThe first restoration work was undertaken in 1932, when the first campaign to safeguard Haiti's monuments started. Although, the restoration did probably not meet the rules of restoration, it slowed down the deterioration of the ruins and protected them against bad weather. In the second half of the 20th century, the building housed a municipal primary school and lodged various offices of the State and the Municipality. The palace also housed the local office of the National Security Volunteers (VSN), the Tonton Macoute, which was disbanded in 1986.\nIn 1995, the president of Haiti declared the palace national heritage and placed it in hands of the local municipality. Another restoration followed after the 2010 earthquake, the palace was restored from its dilapidated state. However today, the palace is still in poor condition and deteriorating again.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\"Le Palais de la Belle-Rivière dit \"Ka Wa\"\" (PDF).

        "content": "Rav Hiyya bar Ami was a third- and fourth-generation Babylonian Amora.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis main teacher was Ulla, but he also learned from Rav Chisda and Ḥulfana Seder HaDoroth questions whether his father was a Kohen or not.\nOne of his colleagues was Rav Yosef bar Hiyya. The Talmud cites a dispute between Rav Hiyya and Rav Yosef regarding the precise measure of a double sit that determines liability for one who whitens on Shabbat.\nIn several places the Talmud relates that Rav Nachman, Ulla and Avimi bar Pappi were sitting and discussing halakha amongst themselves while Hiyya bar Ami was sitting before them like a student before his teachers. Sometimes he would sit and discuss among them and give answers to their questions.\nThe Talmud says that Rav Hiyya bar Ami's slave once immersed a gentile woman in a mikveh so he could have relations with her (to purify her from her niddah status). The slave then married the woman and had a daughter with her. The Talmud discusses the status of the woman and her daughter, whether immersion for the sake of niddah is also effective for conversion to Judaism.\n\n\n== Sayings ==\nMost of Rav Hiyya bar Ami's statements are said in the name of Ulla and are in the realm of halacha. The following Aggadic statements of Rav Hiyya bar Ami in the name of Ulla all appear in Berakhot .\n\nRabbi Hiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: From the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, blessed is He, has only four cubits of halacha.\nOne who benefits from the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears Heaven. For regarding fear of Heaven, the verse states, \"Fortunate is the man who fears God,\" whereas regarding one who benefits from the toil of his hands, the verse states, \"When you eat the fruit of your labor you are fortunate and it is good for you.\" \"Fortunate\" means in this world. \"Good for you\" in the world to come. With regard to fear of Heaven it does not say \"It will be good for you.\"\nA person should always live in the place of his teacher, for as long as Shimei ben Gera was alive, Solomon did not marry Pharaoh's daughter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 10th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Stockbrokers) (10th RF) was an infantry unit of 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. Recruited from the financial community of the City of London it was the original 'Pals battalion'. It served on the Western Front from July 1915 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme and the Ancre, at Arras and Ypres, against the German spring offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive.\n\n\n== Recruitment ==\n\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.\nMeanwhile, on 19 August the Director of Recruiting at the War Office (WO), Major-General Sir Henry Rawlinson, wrote to his friend Major the Hon Robert 'Bobby' White, who worked at the stockbrokers Govett & Sons in the City of London. He told White that Kitchener was anxious to get additional recruits for the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). He suggested that they could recruit from men working for the financial businesses in the city: 'many City employés ... would be willing to enlist if they were assured that they would serve with their friends'. White set up a recruiting office at Govett's premises in Throgmorton Street and enlisted over 1600 men in under a week. Parading before Field Marshal Earl Roberts at Temple Gardens on 29 August in all sorts of clothing, from silk hats and morning coats to caps and Norfolk jackets, they marched to the Tower of London to be sworn in by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Vansittart Bowater, who later became the battalion's Honorary Colonel. Impressed by the response to the battalion, the Earl of Derby coined the phrase 'a battalion of pals', and began recruiting similar groups in Liverpool. Soon Pals battalions were springing up all over the country. The Royal Fusiliers sponsored several  of these – the Empire Battalion, the Public Schools Battalions, the Sportsmen, the Frontiersmen etc, but the 'Stockbrokers' was the first, handed over to the WO as part of  'Kitchener's Second New Army' (K2) on 6 September 1914.\n\n\n== Training ==\nOn 3 September the men paraded at the Tower and entrained for Colchester in Essex, where they were accommodated at Sobraon Barracks. Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Hawker, formerly of the Coldstream Guards and just returned from service with the Anatolian Gendarmerie in the Turkish Empire, was appointed commanding officer (CO) with White as second-in-command. White had been able to obtain 25 ex-non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from the Brigade of Guards to assist with the training, which proceeded rapidly, although there were not enough rifles to equip the whole battalion. Hawker left in December and White was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 6 December to command the battalion. As a 'spare' Kitchener battalion outside the main army organisation, the 10th Royal Fusiliers was designated as 'Army Troops', ie not assigned to a specific formation. White lobbied to get the battalion attached to the First New Army (K1), which would be going overseas first. However, it was attached to the 18th (Eastern) Division which was gathering round Colchester as part of K2. 10th Royal Fusiliers remained attached to this division until 25 February 1915, when it moved to Andover, Hampshire, to join 44th (later 37th) Division. (The battalion's depot companies seem to have remained at Colchester.)\nAs authorised in March 1915, 37th Division consisted of Kitchener battalions that had originally been allocated as Army Troops to the New Armies. 10th Royal Fusiliers was allotted to 111th Brigade in the new division; the brigade also included 13th RF, 13th King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), and 13th Rifle Brigade (RB). By April 1915 when the division was formed, all its units had been training for some months, and it was quickly assembled on Salisbury Plain for final battle training. 10th Royal Fusiliers was stationed at Windmill Hill near Ludgershall from 7 April to 30 July. In July orders arrived for the division to move to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. Embarkation began on 28 July, the 10th RF advance party arrived in France on 30 July and most of the remainder of the battalion next day. On 2 August the division completed its concentration around Tilques, near Saint-Omer.\n\n\n=== 10th Battalion, Intelligence (B) ===\nBefore World War I the Directorate of Military Intelligence at the War Office had identified a number of officers and civilians whose skills could be used in the event of war, and this \nscratch Intelligence Corps went to France with the BEF in August 1914. These officers’ batmen, and later the policemen recruited for field security duties, were enlisted into the Royal Fusiliers under the cover designation of ‘10th Battalion, Intelligence B’ – not to be confused with the 10th (Stockbrokers’) Battalion, though the varied personnel of the 'Stockbrokers' did provide it with at least one intelligence officer. As the war progressed, more and more men were recruited for their language skills, ranging from idle rich travellers to a showman who trained Russian bears and an Anglo-Armenian sergeant born in France and educated in Czechoslovakia. The 10th RF I(B) specialised in plainclothes security and counter-espionage work and operated in France, Italy, Salonika, the Middle East and Russia.\n\n\n=== 31st (Reserve) Battalion ===\nOn 17 July 1915 the Lord Mayor and City of London raised a second Pals battalion of the Royal Fusiliers from the financial community: the 26th (Service) Battalion (Bankers) was recruited from bank clerks and accountants across the country. It went on to fight in 41st Division on the Western Front and in Italy. On 21 October 1915 the depot companies of the 10th (Stockbrokers) and 26th (Bankers) battalions were combined at Colchester to form the 31st (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, as a Local Reserve unit with the role of training reinforcement drafts for the two parent battalions. 31st (R)  Battalion moved to Leamington Spa in Warwickshire and joined the 24th Reserve Brigade (an all-Royal Fusiliers brigade). By January 1916 it was at Abingdon in Oxfordshire, and in April 1916 the brigade moved to Edinburgh. On 1 September 1916 the Local Reserve battalions were transferred to the Training Reserve (TR) and 31st (R) Bn RF became 107th Training Reserve Battalion, though the training staff retained their Royal Fusiliers badges. On 6 September 1917 it was redesignated 265th (Infantry) Battalion, TR, and on 1 November 1917 it reverted to the regiment as 52nd (Graduated) Bn, RF. It was then at Ipswich in Suffolk as part of 217th Brigade of 72nd Division. 72nd Division was broken up in early 1918, and in February 1918 the battalion transferred to 204th Bde of 68th Division at Newmarket, where it remained for the rest of the war. On 8 February 1919 it was converted into a service battalion and joined the British Army of the Rhine, where it was absorbed into 23rd (Service) Bn, RF (1st Sportsmen's) on 4 April.\n\n\n== Service ==\nOn arrival the units of 37th Division were attached to those of 12th (Eastern) Division in the front line for instruction in trench warfare in the quiet sector near Armentières; on 18 August 10th RF was attached to 8th RF. At the end of August 37 Division entrained for Doullens and then marched to Foncquevillers in the Somme sector, where the BEF was taking over more of the line from French troops. The battalions took turns in the front line, and there was a steady trickle of casualties. From 23 to 27 September during the Battle of Loos the division was stationed at La Cauchie to act as reserve for the French Tenth Army's attack, but then returned to Foncquevillers and the routine of trench holding alternating with billets in Souastre through the autumn and winter. On 10 December the men of 10th RF amused themselves by setting up a large noticeboard near the German trenches with a report of a peace demonstration in Berlin.\nOn 2 January 1916 the second-in-command of the 10th RF was promoted to command another battalion, and was replaced by Major Winston Churchill, who had resigned from the government after the Dardanelles affair and had been serving with the Grenadier Guards. However, Churchill had only been with the 10th RF three days when he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel to command a battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. On the moonless night of 13/14 January 10th RF made use of a gap in the German barbed wire to carry out a large raid, but the raiders were spotted and fired upon at close range, suffering casualties as they withdrew. On 6 February the battalion moved a few miles north to a new sector at Bailleulval, then on 18 March c arried out a two-day march to a training area at Mezerolles. By now the 10th RF, 1100 strong when it landed in France, was down to about 850 men, the casualties so far including 18 killed or died of wounds.\nAfter a four-week period of rest and training the battalion left Mezerolles on 21 April when it moved to Humbercamps in the rear area of the Somme sector, providing working parties for the Royal Engineers (REs) before going back into the line on 30 April. On the morning of 4 May the battalion came under heavy artillery fire, losing 9 men killed or died of wounds and 48 wounded. In May 1916 10th RF received a reinforcement draft of 54 men from 18th (S) Bn RF (1st Public Schools), which had been disbanded after most of its other ranks (ORs) had been commissioned as officers. Another 21 men arrived from 31st (R) Bn RF at Colchester. However, the battalion continued to suffer a steady toll of casualties when holding the trenches. On 5 June it carried out a short raid, which had been carefully rehearsed and was covered by an artillery barrage; casualties were trifling.\n\n\n=== Somme ===\n10th Royal Fusiliers had been in France almost a year and had still not participated in any major action, but the BEF was now preparing for that summer's 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). The artillery bombardment began on 23 June and 10th RF supplied working parties to carry forward gas cylinders for release when the assault was launched on 1 July. Initially, 37th Division was not involved. Then 111th Brigade was attached to 34th Division from 7 July as a temporary replacement for a brigade that had been shattered on the First day on the Somme. The fresh troops were immediately rushed to the front to assist with carrying and working parties. On 9 July 10 RF suffered a few casualties when a large dump of grenades was blown up by enemy shellfire. On 10 July 111th Bde HQ, 10th RF and 13th KRRC took over the left sector of 34th Division's front due east of La Boisselle. The trenches were exposed and badly battered by shellfire. That night C and D Companies of 10th RF relieved 13th RB, which had suffered serious casualties in an attack towards Pozières. Next day patrols advanced the line by 200 yards (180 m). The Battle of Bazentin Ridge was launched before dawn on 14 July: 112th Bde attacked Pozières at 08.30 the following morning (15 July), supported by 111th Bde. 10th RF advanced up 'Sausage Valley' in support at 09.00, intending to pass through and continue the attack, but the leading waves of 112th Bde had been held up 400 yards (370 m) short of Pozières by machine gun fire and the valley was full of bunched up battalions, which began to fall back to the cover of a sunken road. 10th RF pushed on, C and B Companies each on a two-platoon front followed by D and A. With this new impetus the attack reached a small orchard on the Albert–Pozières road 200 yards (180 m) from the village. Fighting went on round the village all day but despite a new artillery bombardment from 17.00 to 18.00 10th RF's second attack was disjointed when the damp signal rockets failed to fire. No further progress was possible and the attacking brigades fell back to the remaining trenches. 10th RF had lost 42 killed, 183 wounded and 21 missing; the casualties included all four company commanders. The battalion was immediately relieved, reaching the shelter of deep dugouts in the rear by 02.00 next morning.\nSome reinforcements arrived from 31st RF in England and the battalion underwent some training. On 31 July it went up in support of 101st Bde in the front line. It spent some days improving the support trenches, then on 3 August it moved up to hold the front line while 16th Royal Scots (101st Bde) attacked as part of the Battle of Pozières Ridge. The attack was a failure, so 10th RF resumed its work in the support line under spasmodic shellfire. On 6 August it relieved 13th KRRC in High Wood, working on the trenches there, and patrolling forward to locate the German trenches hidden in the tangled woodland. The battalion was relieved and moved back to 'Bottom Wood' among the heavy gun batteries, where a new draft of reinforcements arrived. 10th RF left the Somme on 18 August, travelling by train to billets in Estaires, then on 22 August to Camblain-Châtelain, where it rejoined 37th Division. It moved into huts near Bully-les-Mines on 30 August.\nOn 5 September 10th RF was attached to 190th Bde of 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, holding the line in the Calonne-sur-la-Lys sector. Next day A and C Companies went up to the line at Fosse 10 and were replaced in 10th RF by two companies from 10th Royal Dublin Fusiliers. This composite battalion then relieved 13th RF in the trenches on 7 September. No man's land here was narrow, and raids and shelling were common. On 11 September the companies of 10th RF were relieved and concentrated again at billets in Verdrel. Next day Lt-Col White left the battalion on promotion to command a brigade. He was succeeded by Maj Rice of the Scottish Horse, who had previously been attached to 13th RF. On 17 September 10th RF returned to Bully-Grenay and 111th Bde, which took over the sector from 190th Bde. The battalion then took turns in the front line, and absorbed another draft of 115 reinforcements.\n\n\n=== Ancre ===\n\nOn 17 October 37th Division marched back to the Somme, arriving at Puchevillers behind Albert on 22 October. Training here and at Hem-Hardinval was restricted by bad weather and the need to clear muddy roads. On 13 November 111th Bde moved up to the line and came under the command of 63rd (RN) Division for the Battle of the Ancre. Next day 10th RF advanced with the support of a tank to mop up a German redoubt that 63rd (RN) Division had bypassed the day before. It captured 270 Germans and released 60 British prisoners without a shot being fired, the tank terrifying the defenders. The battalion then spent the day collecting wounded from the previous day's battlefield while the rest of 111th Bde pushed on to Beaucourt and towards the objective of 'Muck Trench' (so named from its muddy condition). 37th Division took over command of the sector on 15 November, and that night 10th RF was sent up to relieve 13th KRRC, discovering and capturing a party of Germans still in the trenches when they arrived. At dawn the battalion attacked a group of trenches known as the 'Triangle', but was driven back by rifle fire; a bombing party reached the Triangle in the afternoon but was also driven back. The battalion was next ordered to occupy Muck Trench and establish a chain of four strongpoints along 600 yards (550 m) of its length. Although the trench was reached it was under shellfire and the strongpoints could not be established in daylight; eventually the two left posts were set up after dark. At 06.10 on 18 November the battalion made another attempt on the Triangle in cooperation with an attack by the neighbouring 32nd Division. Although most of the battalion's attackers reached their objectives, 32nd Division's attack failed and 10th RF had to withdraw from its gains. Strong patrols during the night also failed to enter the Triangle due to lack of promised artillery support. 10th RF made one last attack on 19 November, after a three-hour bombardment of the objective, but nothing was gained. 10th RF was finally relieved from Muck Trench that night and returned to Puchevillers.\nAfter two weeks' training at Puchevillers, where it absorbed 156 poorly-trained reinforcements, 10th RF marched northwards on 13 December, arriving in the trenches of the Neuve-Chapelle sector on 21 December. Here it began a routine of alternating trench duty with other battalions of 111th Bde, the recent reinforcements being trained at nearby Calonne-sur-la-Lys. The battalion also received a draft from 11th (Reserve) Battalion, East Surrey Regiment. In early February the brigade shifted to the Hulluch sector, where C Company carried out a raid on 1 March. On 4 March the battalion was relieved and marched to the divisional training area at Roëllecourt, west of Arras, where it trained in snowy weather for the forthcoming Battle of Arras.\n\n\n=== Arras ===\n\n10th RF's (and Third Army's) objective for this attack was the village of Monchy-le-Preux on the high ground above the River Scarpe, and the operation was carefully rehearsed. The attack was to begin on 9 April after four days of bombardment, with the assaulting formations taking a succession of objectives, the Black, Blue and Brown lines. The fresh 37th Division waiting in the Arras suburbs would then pass through to capture the final (Green Line) objective, just beyond Monchy, but it was unclear whether this could be tackled on the first day. The assault went in at 05.30 and at 12.00 111th and 112th Bdes were ordered up to the Black Line. Then at 15.00 111th Bde followed 12th (Eastern) and 15th (Scottish) Divisions up Battery Valley, believing the Wancourt–Feuchy trenches (the Brown Line) to have already been captured. However, the brigade came under heavy machine gun fire from these trenches. It was not until 18.37 that 15th (S) Division reported the Brown Line secured, and 111th Bde attacked as darkness approached. By now the enemy had recovered from the initial shock of the assault, and the British field artillery was still moving up. 111th Brigade was held up by uncut wire and its supporting tank broke down; the opportunity to seize Monchy on the first day was lost. During the night the troops of 111th and 112th Bdes were disentangled from those of 12th (E) Division, and were ordered to carry out their attack next morning once the rest of the Wancourt–Feuchy trenches had been captured. 37th Division's other brigade (63rd) was already through the gap and holding Orange Hill, so it led the attack. 111th Brigade followed and launched its assault about 12.00 in a snowstorm from the northern slope of Orange Hill, making ground rapidly despite the lack of field artillery support (although the heavy guns were bombarding Monchy). However, the machine gun fire from the village and from the north side of the river brought 10th and 13th RF to a halt about 500 yards (460 m) short of Monchy. An erroneous report that they were in Monchy led to the British cavalry being brought up to exploit a breakthrough, but they achieved nothing. The brigade tried again on 11 April, this time with four tanks in support. Progress was slow, but 13th KRRC and 13th RB finally made their way to Monchy, followed by 10th RF, who stormed into the village itself about 11.00. The official historian described the capture of Monchy-le-Preux as 'one of the outstanding feats of the whole battle'. Although the remnant of 111th Bde was now weak, with very few officers, it was assisted in consolidating the village by 63rd Bde and the cavalry. 10th RF was withdrawn at 23.00 that night, having lost 12 officers and 240 ORs killed, wounded or missing. Among the wounded was Lt-Col Rice and Maj R.A. Smith took command on 10 April.\n\n10th RF returned to the front on 19 April in time for the Second Battle of the Scarpe, opening on 22 April. The battalion held a front of about 250 yards (230 m) on the right of the brigade, and attacked next day. At Zero (04.45) the battalion advanced with each company in four waves, closely following the Creeping barrage. The advance went to plan until the German second line trench was reached. 63rd Brigade on the right had edged too far left, and the battalion on 10th RF's left was slow coming forward, so the battalion was open to machine gun fire from the flanks. Once the confusion was sorted out, a patrol from 10th RF went forward and reported that the second objective, Cuba Trench, was unoccupied. 10th RF, reduced to three officers and about 50 ORs in fighting condition, occupied the trench by 09.30, and was followed by 13th RF and 13th KRRC. Patrols made contact with the Germans along a road about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) ahead. After this success, the Germans bombarded Cuba Trench heavily, but 111th Bde consolidated it over the following days. On the morning of 28 April 10th RF extended along Cuba Trench to allow 13th RF and 13th KRRC to carry out the next assault on the road in front, the only part of the Battle of Arleux or Gavrelle that went to plan. During the night a working party from 10th RF helped the REs to strengthen the position by constructing a second trench and strongpoint in front of Cuba Trench. The battalion was relieved on the night of 29 April, having lost 4 officers killed and 6 wounded, 42 ORs killed, 192 wounded and 22 missing during the week of fighting in front of Gavrelle.\nUntil the middle of June 10 RF was at rest, training, or providing working parties for the REs. It absorbed over 300 new drafts, amounting to almost half the strength of the battalion and many proving to be unfit. Major Smith was promoted to take permanent command of the battalion.\n\n\n=== Ypres ===\nOn 23 June the battalion began a march north to the Ypres Salient, where 37th Division was to join Second Army for the forthcoming Third Battle of Ypres. 10th RF went into the line south of Wyteschaete on 28 June, suffering a few casualties over following days from shellfire and patrolling. It was behind the lines training for the attack from 16 to 25 July, then re-entered the line. The offensive began with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July, in which Second Army played a minor role, advancing its line slightly, with 10th RF supporting 63rd Bde. It was relieved on 6 August, then spent 21 days training. Lieutenant-Col Smith left and was succeeded by Maj Cyril Carter, second-in-command of 10th Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, while Maj John Dallas Waters, formerly 10th RF's adjutant, returned from 13th RF as second-in-command.\nThe battalion did another tour of duty in the front line from 26 August to 3 September, then provided working parties to dig cable trenches, suffering some casualties from Mustard gas shelling. It spent two days from 14 September in support of 19th (Western) Division, but its only activity was providing carrying parties. The battalion next provided guards for prisoner-of-war camps at Bailleul and Bois Confluet, the rest of the battalion forming a composite company that continued training and providing working parties. The reduced battalion went into the line on 28 September, suffering some casualties when the neighbouring 13th RF was raided by the Germans at dawn on 30 September, and there was constant enemy shelling. The Germans put in several more attacks on 1 October to disrupt preparations for the Battle of Broodseinde planned for 4 October. 111th Brigade's role in the battle was to form a defensive flank, 13th RF moving forward with the neighbouring troops, supported by 10th RF. Throughout the day 10th RF was required to send detachments up from the support trench to assist battalions in the front line, leaving only 40 men available at one point. The brigade failed to take its objective, a line of dugouts in Gheluvelt Wood. The battalion was relieved from its position in the support trench on 8 October. It was then employed in roadmaking until going into rest billets near Hazebrouck on 26 October.\n\n\n=== Winter 1917–18 ===\n10th Royal Fusiliers spent the following months training, providing working parties, and holding the line in the Hollebeke and White Chateau sector of the Salient, where raiding and gas attacks were common. The battalion was now so short of men that it was reorganised from four to three companies. The CO, Lt-Col Carter, allegedly took to drink in the shelter of a dugout and was replaced on 28 January 1918 by Maj Dallas Waters, who had begun the war as a Second lieutenant. In February 1918 the manpower crisis in the BEF was so bad that one in four infantry battalions was disbanded to provide reinforcements for the others: 10th RF received a draft from the disbanded 12th RF in 24th Division.\nOn 8 March 10th RF was in support when the Germans put in a serious attack in the Gheluvelt sector, heavily shelling the trenches occupied by 13th KRRC from 06.30 and occupying part of the British front line at about 14.00. Lieutenant-Col Waters took command of the brigade sector and ordered up D Company and then B Company, while A Company carried forward supplies of bombs. The situation became critical, and later the only men available to carry up more bombs were the HQ details of the two battalions. D Company was pushed back in the early evening, the enemy being held off by Lance-Corporal Charles Robertson with a Lewis gun team. Realising that he was being cut off, Robertson sent two men back for reinforcements while he and another man continued firing at the enemy. No help arrived and the two men fell back to another defended position, then were forced to withdraw a further 10 yards (9.1 m), where Robertson mounted the Lewis gun on the parapet. His comrade was killed, but despite being wounded Robertson fired off all his ammunition and made his way back with his gun. For this action he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. During the night of 8/9 March 10th RF put in three counter-attacks, the first two being unsuccessful, but A and B Companies managed to establish a trench block by about 20.40. The third attack, at dawn, involved a line of men passing bombs up the trenches to the attackers, supported by snipers. Some of the Germans ran, being shot down by machine gun and rifle fire from C Company in the chateau. By 06.45 the enemy had been cleared from the line and posts were being re-established. The battalion had lost 2 officers and 11 ORs killed, 5 officers and 47 ORs wounded and 2 missing in this unnamed action. Afterwards Lt-Col Waters received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On 14 March C Company operated dummy figures in No man's land to divert attention from a raid by 112th Bde.\n\n\n=== Spring Offensive ===\nThe Germans launched their Spring Offensive against Third and Fifth Armies on 21 March, achieving a near-breakthrough. Although heavily shelled (10th RF lost 14 killed and 11 wounded when a long-range shell hit a Nissen hut occupied by A Company), Second Army was not attacked and quickly despatched reinforcements south to help stem the enemy advance. 37th Division was sent by rail on 28 March, arriving at Hébuterne next day and beginning to take over part of the line on 31 March/1 April. 10th Royal Fusiliers went into the brigade support line at Gommecourt. 37th Division came under attack on 5 April, on the final day of the offensive (the Battle of the Ancre (1918)), but 10th RF's participation was restricted to carrying forward ammunition. Casualties were suffered among the transport section from enemy shelling. The battalion took over part of the front line the following evening. Although the first German offensive had ended in this sector, intermittent shelling, raiding, and bombing by aircraft continued throughout April and May.\n\nOn 9 May the battalion moved into positions around Foncquevillers, which was subjected to a saturation bombardment by an estimated 10,000 high explosive and gas shells on 11 May. Among the gas casualties were the CO, second-in-command, adjutant, medical officer and 18 other officers and 300 men, many temporarily blinded, who all had to make their way down to the casualty stations. A battalion runner recalled that 'long lines of men were being guided along, each man with his hand on the shoulder of the man in front'. Captain Tanner and the assistant adjutant came up from the transport lines with all available men to take charge of the battalion, which remained in the line for two more days. After it was relieved there were rumours that the shattered 10th RF would be broken up, but the divisional commander disagreed and arranged for reinforcements to be drafted to it, 10 officers and 127 ORs on 17 May and a further 4 officers and 44 ORs on 23 May. It spent the month training and holding reserve positions before taking over a frontline sector on 24 June. Trench routine and working parties filled the following weeks.\n\n\n=== Hundred Days Offensive ===\nThe Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August. On 19 August 37th Division moved up to take part in a dawn attack next day at Ablainzevelle. At 04.55 the creeping barrage began, and 111th Bde had little difficulty achieving its objectives. B and D Companies of 10th RF worked their way round either side of Ablainzevelle, then at 05.30 D Company consolidated on the ridge behind. C Company was detailed to mop up the village, being held up by a machine gun position that had been too close to the start line for effective artillery bombardment, but the infantry quickly dealt with the post. The battalion reported 1 officer and 7 ORs killed. Two days later 37th Division attacked again at Achiet-le-Grand and Bihucourt. 111th Bde advanced at 11.00 with 13th KRRC and 13th RB in line, supported by tanks, then 10th RF passed through at 13.20 behind a fresh hour-long barrage and took Bihucourt despite strong opposition and an open flank where a neighbouring battalion had not kept up. The village suffered heavy gas shelling that night, but the battalion was stationed outside and only lost 3 men killed in the whole operation. The following evening 10th RF served as reserve for the division's attack on Favreuil, advancing 4 miles (6.4 km) under shellfire from the railway cutting at Achiet-le-Grand. The battalion found 13th KRRC pinned down in front of Favreuil, so it moved up a valley west of the village and delivered an assault from the flank, causing the defenders to surrender. 10th RF then patrolled aggressively forward during  the night to gain touch with neighbouring units. When it was relieved on 27 August 10th RF had advanced 7 miles (11 km) in five days of action, capturing 1366 prisoners, 75 machine guns and 1 field gun, at a cost of 1 officer and 32 ORs killed, mainly while moving up from the railway cutting.\nAfter a period of training, 37th Division moved up to the edge of Havrincourt Wood for its next attack, with 10th RF entering the front line on 13 September. 111th Brigade led the division's assault on the Hindenburg Line (the Battle of Havrincourt). When the barrage began at 05.30 10th RF advanced with one company either side of the Trescault–Ribécourt-la-Tour road. Although the advance was successfully accomplished, the neighbouring division did not keep up, leaving the battalion exposed in a dangerous salient under enfilade machine gun fire. The Germans counter-attacked at midday, pushing the battalion down the trenches, and Lt-Col Tanner was ordered to withdraw from the most exposed position, but enemy fire still made the road dangerous for carrying parties. Fighting over Derby Trench and Bilhen Chapel Wood carried on all night and next day a small attack by the battalion was foiled by an enemy aircraft bombing and machine gunning the attackers. Lieutenant-Col Tanner requested artillery support for a renewed attack, but was ordered to hold fast, and the battalion was relieved on the night of 15/16 September, having lost 1 officer and 26 ORs killed. On 18 September the battalion was roused to move quickly up to support 112th Bde in the front line because of a German counter-attack, but the danger soon passed. During September Lt-Col Dallas Waters returned to command the battalion.\nThe Allies carried out a series of coordinated attacks along the Western Front on 26–29 September, including an assault crossing of part of the Canal du Nord. On 30 September 111th Bde found that the German bridgehead at Banteux had been abandoned, and 10th RF closed up to form an outpost line along the bank of the Escaut Canal. Attempts to push patrols across the canal were repelled, but on 5 October the enemy retreated and 13th KRRC and 13th RB crossed, pushing forward until they met opposition along the Beaurevoir Line. The division assaulted this line as part of the Battle of Cambrai on 8 October. 10th Royal Fusiliers was in position at midnight, the barrage began at 04.30 and the battalion attacked four minutes later with three companies in line, one in support, and a company of 13th RB as reserve, while 13th KRRC acted as flank guard. The battalion was held up by two belts of barbed wire that had been insufficiently cut by the artillery, and by machine guns in concrete emplacements, but with the help of tanks the Fusiliers forced their way through. Leaving C Company to mop up, the battalion moved on to capture Bel Aise Farm with many prisoners and reached its objective, a sunken road near Hurtebise Farm. 13th KRRC came up alongside about an hour later and 112th Bde passed through to continue the advance. 37th Division's advance now became a pursuit of the beaten enemy to the River Selle, but 111th Bde was withdrawn for rest at Bapaume.\nThe brigade was back in the line on 23 October for the second day of the BEF's next set-piece attack, the Battle of the Selle. After 5th Division had taken the first three objectives, including the village of Beaurain, 37th Division was to assemble 111th Bde behind a smoke barrage and then send it through at 08.00. The Germans defended Beaurain tenaciously, and 111th Bde's move was postponed until 08.40. When it went forward (10th RF supporting) the chief opposition came from machine guns, which were dealt with by the division's heavy mortars, and the whole of the fourth objective had been achieved by 12.45. However, the neighbouring corps on the right had been held up, and 111th Bde was unable to advance further towards Salesches until 17.15, without a barrage. 10th RF in the lead was soon brought to a stop by fire coming in from railway to the right, so it formed a defensive flank, making a few minor advances during the night before 112th Bde continued the advance next morning. 10th RF then went into billets at Neuville.\nThe battalion was brought forward on the night of 3/4 November for the next operation, part of the Battle of the Sambre. After a hot meal in Salesches the 10th RF was in position in support of 111th Bde at 05.00. The battalion advanced at 05.30 with B and C Companies leading, A and D in close support. After passing through 13th KRRC on the Blue Line, 10th RF continued forward, dealing with machine gun posts, D Company then pushing through Louvignies, killing or capturing all the Germans in the village. The battalion reached its objective on time and took up positions. A German barrage behind the companies cut off communications with battalion HQ, so HQ moved forward to Louvignies. At 20.00 the battalion was ordered back to Beaurain by brigade HQ, after what the RF regimental history calls a 'finished little engagement in which, for a total loss of 52 officers and men, they had captured 300 prisoners, three field guns, a motor lorry and a large number of machine guns'. It was 10th RF's last battle.\nEarly on 5 November 5 Division passed through and took over from the 37th, which concentrated with 10th RF staying in its 'bad' billets at Beaurain. On 11 November the division moved to Caudry, and during the march the men were told that the Armistice with Germany had come into force at 11.00, bringing hostilities to an end.\n\n\n=== Post-Armistice ===\nThe units of 37th Division were now employed in training, education and recreation. On 1 December they began a long move to an area north of Charleroi, but from 2 to 14 December were billeted north of Le Quesnoy in bad weather until the march could resume. On 20 December the division settled into its final billets near Charleroi. Demobilisation began, with the first man leaving 10th RF on 22 December, though new drafts continued to arrive from England: 201 on 28–29 January alone. Duties included guarding the supply railhead at Rœux. During February 253 men were demobilised, and 200 more left the battalion, having volunteered for duty with 23rd RF in the occupation force in Germany (the British Army of the Rhine) . By early March the battalion was reduced to HQ and one company. 37th Division ceased to exist  on 25 March and 10th RF closed its war diary on 31 March, when there were only 162 men on the strength, many of them absent on leave or detached duty. Shortly afterwards the cadre of the battalion returned to England and was disbanded at Catterick Camp.\nThe battalion historian estimates that 316 of the 10th RF's original 1453 volunteers were killed during the war, either with the battalion or after transfer to other units. As a whole, the battalion lost 54 officers and 688 men dead or missing between July 1915 and November 1918.\n\n\n== Insignia ==\nIn addition to the Royal Fusiliers' cap badge and brass shoulder-title, men of 10th RF wore 37th Division's gold horseshoe on the upper arm. In 1917–18 37th Division adopted a system of 'battle patches' on the upper arm to identify individual units and subunits. As the senior battalion of its brigade, 10th RF would have worn a coloured disc; for 111th Bde this was dark blue. Above the disc was a horizontal bar: red for A Company, dark blue for B, purple for C and green for D.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nThere are a memorial plaque and roll of honour to the dead of 10th Royal Fusiliers (Stockbrokers) in the church of St Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London. The plaque refers to the King's Colour presented to the battalion in January 1919: this was placed above the plaque but was subsequently stolen, leaving only the bare staff. Alongside the battalion's memorial plaque is another to Brig-Gen Hon Robert White, the battalion's long-time commanding officer who died in 1936.\nThe Royal Fusiliers War Memorial, with its bronze figure of a Fusilier sculpted by Albert Toft, stands at Holborn Bar on the boundary of the City of London. A panel on the back of the pedestal lists all the RF battalions, including 10th (Stockbrokers), 10th (B) of the Intelligence Corps, and 31st (Reserve).\nThe 37th Division memorial sculpted by Lady Feodora Gleichen (sister of the division's first commander) was erected at Monchy-le-Preux.\nThe war memorial in the London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square includes names of many members of 10th RF.\n\n\n== Commanders ==\nThe following officers commanded 10th RF:\n\nLt-Col Claude Hawker, Coldstream Guards, September–December 1914\nLt-Col Hon Robert White, promoted to command 6 December 1914; promoted to command a brigade 12 September 1916\nLt-Col Rice, Scottish Horse, temporary 12 September 1916, later promoted; wounded 10 April 1917\nLt-Col R.A.

        "content": "Flavius Julius Eucherius (d.after 395) was a Roman politician and member of the Theodosian Dynasty.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was the son of Flavius Honorius. His brother was Count Theodosius the Elder. Eucherius began his service under the reign of Emperor Julian, continued during the reign of Valentinian I. He enjoyed the support of Empress Justina. In 377 AD, Gratian appointed him to the fiscal office of Comes sacrarum largitonum.\nIn 379 AD, after the accession of his nephew Theodosius I to the Eastern Empire, his position at court was greatly strengthened. In 381 AD, Eucherius became consul together with Flavius Syagrius as his colleague.\nIn 393 AD, he appealed to the Praetorian Prefect of the East, Rufinus regarding the punishment for an insult by Lucian, the Comes Orientus. In 395 AD, he contributed to the overthrow of Rufinus by Flavius Stilicho. His further fate is unknown.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 Crown Royal Purple Bag Project 200 was the 11th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 42nd iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, May 11, 2024, in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198 km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race took the scheduled 147 laps to complete. Justin Allgaier, driving for JR Motorsports, would put on a blistering performance, winning both stages and leading a race-high 119 laps to earn his 24th career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his first of the season. With his win, he ties with Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the 10th most wins in Xfinity Series history. To fill out the podium, Austin Hill, driving for Richard Childress Racing, and Cole Custer, driving for Stewart–Haas Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.\n\nSince 2015, the race has hosted NASCAR's Throwback weekend, which features cars sporting paint schemes that pay homage to past teams and drivers.  (The lineage of this race includes races billed as the Southern 500 from 2005 to 2020.)\n\n\n=== Entry list ===\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Starting lineup ==\nPractice and qualifying was originally scheduled to be held on Friday, May 10, at 5:05 PM and 5:35 PM EST, but were both cancelled due to constant rain showers. The starting lineup would be determined per the NASCAR rulebook. As a result, Cole Custer, driving for Stewart–Haas Racing, will start on the pole.\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\n\n\n=== Starting lineup ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 45\n\nStage 2 Laps: 45\n\nStage 3 Laps: 57\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Clifford Vernon Melbourne (10 June 1888 – 7 January 1943) was an Australian historian and writer. He had a long involvement with the University of Queensland as a lecturer and associate professor in history. Initially concentrating on Australian constitutional history, he later developed an interest in international relations and foreign policy, notably Australia–China and Australia–Japan relations.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMelbourne was born on 10 June 1888 in Hackney, South Australia. He was the son of Elizabeth Agnes (née Braidwood) and William Clifford Melbourne; his father was a printer and trade union official.\nMelbourne attended Norwood Public School and then trained as a pupil-teacher, teaching at Unley Public School for three years. He went on to attend the University of Adelaide, graduating in 1910 with honours in history.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career and military service ===\n\nIn 1913, Melbourne moved to Brisbane and joined the University of Queensland's history and economics department as a temporary assistant lecturer. He was a founding member of the Historical Society of Queensland, serving as its inaugural honorary secretary and delivering the inaugural address at its first meeting. The paper he presented was titled \"Methods of Historical Research\" and has been described as \"probably the first time a professional\nhistorian spoke and wrote about historiography in Queensland\".\nMelbourne enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in August 1914 as a captain in the 9th Battalion. He served on the Gallipoli campaign and was wounded in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, receiving a further injury in June 1915. He was invalided back to Australia in October 1915 and returned to the University of Queensland, also undertaking work in wartime censorship.\n\n\n=== Academia ===\nIn 1919, Melbourne was appointed as a lecturer in history and industrial history at the University of Queensland. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the university's newly created professorial chair in history in 1924, losing out to Henry Alcock. He later made unsuccessful applications for professorships at the University of Sydney (1929), University of Adelaide (1934), and University of Melbourne (1937).\nMelbourne was eventually elevated to the rank of associate professor at the University of Queensland in the 1930s. He served on the university's academic senate from 1926 to 1928 and from 1932 to 1943, and was heavily involved in the planning of the new campus at St Lucia. He was remembered by vice-chancellor John Douglas Story as \"one of the most virile and progressive members of the Senate\".\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nMelbourne's early interests were in Australian constitutional history. He completed a Master of Arts at the University of Adelaide in 1921, with a thesis on the constitutional development of Queensland. In 1925 he began writing Queensland History, a serialised column published in the Daily Mail and intended for publication as a book, which never eventuated. In 1928, Melbourne was awarded a Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial fellowship to study in England, completing a Ph.D. under A. P. Newton in 1930. He subsequently contributed two chapters to volume seven of Newton's Cambridge History of the British Empire (1933) and published Early Constitutional Development in Australia (1934).\nMelbourne's later work concentrated on international relations and Australian relations with Asia. He visited China and Japan on behalf of the University of Queensland in 1931 and 1932. His subsequent publication Report on Australian Intercourse with Japan and China recommended that the Australian government send an official delegation to Asia, which with a similar publication by H. W. Gepp influenced John Latham's Australian Eastern Mission in 1934. Melbourne chaired the federal government's Advisory Committee on Eastern Trade from 1933 to 1935 and was an unsuccessful applicant to become Australia's first trade commissioner to Japan in 1935. He returned to China and Japan in 1936 and published Report on a Visit to the Universities of China and Japan in the same year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1916, Melbourne married Ellen Mary Lowenthal; the couple had no children. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage at a private hospital in Brisbane on 7 January 1943, aged 54. His sudden death was described by the university's chancellor James William Blair as a \"great loss to our educational progress\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCotton, James (2013). \"A.

        "content": "Homeworld: Vast Reaches is a virtual reality real-time strategy game developed by FarBridge and published by Gearbox Software. It was released exclusively on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3, with plans to release it as a PC VR title later in 2024. It is a part of the Homeworld series of games.\nThe game takes the mechanics used in the other Homeworld titles and adapts them for use in a VR game. The player controls units in \"control groups,\" which allow for easier control in the VR setting. The plot takes place between the games Homeworld and Homeworld 2.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nHomeworld: Vast Reaches is a real-time strategy game set in space. Gameplay, as in most real-time strategy games, is focused on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game features only a single-player mode, as opposed to other Homeworld releases, which included multiplayer and skirmish modes. The campaign consists of a six to eight hour story-driven campaign broken up into 11 levels.\nTo adapt the Homeworld series to virtual reality, ships are managed by the player in \"control groups,\" and the player builds units and manages each control group with virtual reality gestures and controls. The central ship of the player's fleet is the mothership, a large base which in previous Homeworld games was where ships were constructed and upgraded. Resources can be spent by the player on building new ships; unlike in previous Homeworld games, ships are no longer constructed inside of the mothership, appearing instead directly inside of control groups. Buildable ships come in a variety of types, which are discovered over the course of the game as the story progresses.\nThe Quest gives the option to play the game in mixed-reality mode – the Quest's outer cameras will place the game's ships inside of the player's room around them. The Quest 3 uses its color cameras while the Quest 2 only supports a black-and-white mixed-reality mode. Camera controls use a combination of gestures, the player's vision, and the Quest controller triggers to allow the player a wide freedom of movement.\n\n\n=== Plot ===\nThe game's plot takes place between Homeworld and Homeworld 2, when the Fleet Command Karan S’jet has disconnected from the mothership. Because of this, a new and more aggressive Fleet Command, Tyrra Soban, takes over as Karan teaches her how to manage the fleet. The fleet fends off a new enemy, which IGN's Dan Stapleton described as a faction of \"techno-fetishist bureaucrats [...] that are easy to hate.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe development team built Vast Reaches for VR from the beginning, focusing on the challenges of creating the controls for a VR Homeworld game as one of their top priorities. The release of Vast Reaches was announced on April 23, 2024, on social media, with its Meta Quest release date confirmed for May 2, 2024 and a PC VR release date later in the year.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIGN's Dan Stapleton gave Vast Reaches a mixed review, calling it \"an unsatisfying lite\" version of Homeworld. Stapleton noted that although the game captured the series's look and feel well, but that the simplified controls in VR were \"underwhelming\" and that it takes away some of the details that made Homeworld memorable. In a more positive note, Tomas Franzese of Digital Trends pushed back on Stapleton's criticism of the game's easier difficulty, noting that it allowed Vast Reaches to be a good starting place for people new to the series.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMeta store page",

        "content": "On 14 February 2023, The Future of Road Investment in Wales report was published by the Welsh Government. The report concluded a period of reassessment on the government's existing commitments to Wales' road infrastructure and how it matched new government policy. It is commonly shortened as the Welsh Government's roads review.\nMost existing road infrastructure projects were either cancelled, paused for modification, or replaced with an alternative. Those cancelled, included most of the major proposed projects, such as the Third Menai Crossing and Flintshire Red Route.\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nSurface transport emissions are the third-largest source of Wales' carbon emissions, although the Committee on Climate Change described Wales' emissions as having been \"virtually flat[ened]\" since 1990. First Minister Mark Drakeford stated transport emissions accounted for 15% of Wales' emissions and has been the \"most stubborn sector\" to reduce them.\nIn 2019, the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency, and set 2050 as a target date for Wales to achieve net zero emissions; significant policy changes, compared to those in place when many of the road investment scheme were first conceived. In its 2021 Llwybr Newydd, Wales' transport strategy, the government plans a \"new path\" on policy, focusing on reducing the need for travel and supporting travel that is sustainable. An updated land-use planning policy would complement the transport strategy, and embed a \"sustainable transport hierarchy\". The Net Zero Plan and the strategy aim for passenger transport emissions to be reduced by 22% between 2019 and 2024, and by 98% by 2050. Both call for miles driven by cars to be reduced by 10% by 2030, and for active travel and public transport to account for an increased modal share of 39% by 2030 and 45% by 2040.\nThe actions required to meet these commitments were stated to be \"huge\", with the Senedd's Climate Change Environment and Infrastructure Committee stating in October 2022, that the modal share targets were not backed up by tools that can ensure the pledges can be delivered. Another report said that the Welsh government's pre-existing policy would have only delivered \"just over one fifth\" of the changes to modal shift needed for net zero.\n\n\n=== History ===\nIn June 2021, Deputy Minister for Climate Change, Lee Waters, announced the review of funding for new road schemes by the Welsh Government. Therefore, work on new schemes would be paused for the review. Projects that were already underway at the time of the announcement would still continue, such as the Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales.\nIn September 2022, the panel submitted their final report to the Welsh Government. It was published on 14 February 2023.\n\n\n== Aims ==\nThe Welsh Government stated it commissioned the roads review for the following reasons:\n\nEnsuring road investment assists the government's delivery of their transport strategy, government programme, and Net Zero aims for Wales\nDevelop new criteria for when new road building is needed\nUse such new criteria to decide whether existing projects should be supported, altered or scrapped\nGuide the government on when to reallocate road space on the road network which might benefit from future enhancement\nLook into making savings on road investment while ensuring road issues are addressed, and how to address the backlog of road maintenance\nIt was also stated that the review looked into whether roads also aligned with government policies, and overall being good, concerning the environment, communities, places, people, culture, the Welsh language, and the economy.\n\n\n== Review ==\n\n\n=== Process ===\nThe review was conducted by a panel comprising those from the transport policy, highway engineering, climate change, and freight/logistics sectors. The panel's chair was Lynn Sloman.\nThe panel identified and reviewed 59 schemes. Eight were later dropped due to their insufficient information, or the projects were out of the review's scope. Therefore, 46 schemes made it to the final decision stage of the review.\n\n\n=== Review panel ===\nThe roads review panel was appointed by Lee Waters, deputy minister for climate change in September 2021.\nThe panel consisted of:\n\nSecretariats to the panel included:\n\n\n=== Findings ===\nThe report set out two main recommendations, that new future road investment follows four \"purposes\" and four \"conditions\".\nThe four purposes were: to support modal shift, reduce casualties through small changes, adapt to climate change, and support prosperity through access to development sites that can support sustainable transport. The purposes do not impact maintenance or renewal programmes.\nThe four conditions were: minimise construction carbon emissions, no increasing vehicle speeds that increase emissions, no increasing of road capacity for cars, and do not adversely affect ecologically valuable sites.\nThe report overall sets out 51 recommendations. These include: calling for regional investment programmes on multi-modal transport, a modal shift programme and safer speeds and routes programme for trunk roads, increased attention on freight, and creating \"exemplar\" economic and residential developments.\n\n\n== Impact on existing projects ==\n55 schemes were identified and, subsequently, impacted. 8 schemes were later not reviewed due to being \"out of scope\" or not having enough information. Of the existing road investment schemes reviewed;\n\n17 were allowed to go ahead, as they either met the new criteria or could be modified to meet it.\n31 were not allowed to go ahead.\nOf these, 9 schemes, all in early-development, were recommended for alternatives.\n8 schemes had their existing proposal described as \"not appropriate\", but an alternative solution or multiple could have a stronger case.\n14 schemes were stated to have \"not been demonstrated sufficiently\".\nBy region:\n\nMid Wales: 4 approved, 4 cancelled (2 fully, 2 mostly)\nNorth Wales: 2 approved, 14 cancelled (10 fully, 4 mostly), 5 out-of-scope\nSouth East Wales: 5 approved, 4 fully cancelled, 2 out-of-scope\nSouth West Wales: 6 approved, 4 cancelled (3 fully, 1 mostly), 4 out-of-scope\nThose cancelled included \"all major road building projects,\" which sometimes amounted to nine. Specific major examples include the planned Third Menai Crossing, the Flintshire Red Route and the A483 Wrexham improvements, in North Wales.\nThose proceeding are much smaller, with the largest being the A4042 Pontypool to M4 improvements in Torfaen. Other small improvements going ahead include the A487 Fishguard–Cardigan, and the A4076 in Haverfordwest. Other projects still going ahead include the Llandeilo bypass in Carmarthenshire, and the A465 dualling in the South Wales Valleys.\nOf those in North Wales, the government had already spent £20 million on projects, many of which were later cancelled.\n\n\n== Response ==\nEnvironmental campaigners from Friends of the Earth Cymru described it as \"world-leading and brave\". It was also welcomed by  Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds.\nFollowing publication, the report was criticised by then former Minister for Transport, Ken Skates, stating it \"ignore[d] citizens\". Skates also called for decisions on roads in North Wales to be devolved to the region.\nSome representatives of the construction industry, specifically that of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, warned the report and the subsequent cancellation of projects could put jobs at risk, and asked for clarity on future infrastructure investment.\nWelsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies, criticised the decision, stating it was \"Utter madness\". While Plaid Cymru MS Delyth Jewell agreed on reducing Wales' over-reliance on cars, but stated that there should also be a focus on a transition period, as many areas are \"already underserved by public transport links\".\nFollowing criticism, the review's chair, Lynn Sloman, stated in March 2023, that there was \"considerable engagement\" during the review, despite claims there were not. Sloman defended the decision not to consult the public and complained how the panel's work has been portrayed. Sloman stated that over 30 meetings were conducted with key stakeholders, and engaged with 25 organisations, the third sector, young people, professional institutions, and 14 local authorities. First Minister Mark Drakeford, said that the panel's engagement was \"extensive\".\nFollowing the announcement, in July 2023, a poll was revealed showing opposition to the decision. The 30 June–11 July poll by Opinium of 2,001 Welsh adults, showed that 49% opposed the ban, 33% supported it, and 18% did not know. When accounting for the main three political parties, there was more opposition than support. Conservative voters were most opposed, with 67% opposed compared to 26% supporting. Whereas Labour voters were 46% oppose and 38% support. Plaid Cymru had the narrowest margin, with 43% of their voters opposing and 39% supporting. the decision\nThe specific cancellation of certain schemes was also criticised, with Labour MP Mark Tami opposing the cancellation of the Flintshire Red Route.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTrunk roads in Wales\nRoad speed limits in the United Kingdom#20 mph default speed limit in Wales\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe future of road investment in Wales – Final report",

Areas within the parish include Even Swindon, Rodbourne, Moredon, Pinehurst, Penhill and Gorse Hill. The River Ray, a minor river flowing north to join the Thames, forms part of the western boundary of the parish.\nThe population of the parish was 36,834 at the 2021 census.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe parish spans three wards which each elect three members of Swindon Borough Council: Gorse Hill and Pinehurst, Rodbourne Cheney, and the eastern half of Mannington and Western.\nFor Westminster elections, Central Swindon North is part of the North Swindon constituency.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nLandmarks in the parish include:\n\nThe site of the Swindon Works of the Great Western Railway, where locomotives and rolling stock were built and maintained between 1843 and 1986. Two former workshops and the Chain Test House, are Grade II* listed. Most of the site is now the Swindon Designer Outlet; also here are STEAM (the museum of the Great Western Railway), and the headquarters of English Heritage and the National Trust (in the Heelis building).\nSt Augustine's Church, Even Swindon – a Church of England parish church consecrated in 1908.\nThe Oasis Leisure Centre – a domed structure in operation from 1976 to 2020, expected to reopen in 2026.\nThe North Star campus of Swindon College\nThe headquarters of the UK Space Agency\nSwindon railway station and Swindon loco yard\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCentral Swindon North Parish Council\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of civil parishes in Wiltshire",

        "content": "PropertyLimBrothers (PLB) is a real estate agency, property management and media company, headquartered in Singapore.\n\n\n== History ==\nPropertyLimBrothers was founded in 2016 by Melvin Lim and Adrian Lim, following their stint as Prisons Officers at Singapore Prison Service and their first venture towards real estate in 2007.\nOn 9 September 2022, PropertyLimBrothers left PropNex to form PLB Realty.\nMelvin and Adrian practiced real estate over the course of 10 years through traditional methods, prior to the formation of PropertyLimBrothers. During that time, with the property industry getting increasingly competitive, they looked for ways to stand out. Inspired by home tour videos crafted by real estate agents overseas and how the immersive viewing experience gave these agents a competitive edge and greater reach, the duo posted their first home tour in January 2017 as PropertyLimBrothers.\nSince 2018, PropertyLimBrothers has crafted more than 2,724 home tour Videos and Educational Real Estate Content, and transacted over 1,728 properties.\n\n\n== Corporate Social Responsibility ==\nPropertyLimBrothers has been working closely with World Vision Singapore for over 3 years, since 2021 with aims to improve the quality of life of the needy. World Vision is a Christian humanitarian non-profit organisation dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide.\nIn 2022, PropertyLimBrothers took part in a humanitarian aid expedition with World Vision Singapore to Sambour, Cambodia to understand the villagers’ living conditions and healthcare challenges. There, the team provided Procter & Gamble water purifier sachets, clean water and introduce hygiene habits.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aquilegia micrantha, the Mancos columbine or Bluff City columbine, is a perennial species of plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to Utah, Colorado, and Arizona.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Mancos columbine grows to 30–60cm in height with white, cream, blue, or pink sepals, 8 to 20 mm in length. The blades are white or cream and 6 to 10 mm long. The spurs are white or colored like the sepals, 15 to 30 mm long, and straight with the tips of the spurs curving inward. The stamens extend beyond the blades.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe specific name micrantha means \"small-flowered\", from Greek μικρός \"small\" + ἄνθος \"flower, blossom\".\nThe usual common name Mancos columbine is taken from the town of Mancos, Colorado, from where the type specimen was sent by Alfred Wetherill (brother of Richard Wetherill) to the describer of the species, Alice Eastwood. Wetherill noted in his letter to Eastwood that it was similar enough to Aquilegia ecalcarata that he at first took it for that species.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nAquilegia micrantha is endemic to the Southwestern United States (southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, and extreme northern Arizona), where it grows in hanging gardens in canyons where alkaline water seeps from the bases of cliffs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aquilegia micrantha at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Immaculada Cabecerán i Soler (24 February 1952 – 11 January 2018) was a Catalan footballer and women's football pioneer. Her promotion of the sport in Catalonia led to it becoming popular and formalised, and her ambition created the team that would become FC Barcelona Femení.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nImmaculada Cabecerán i Soler was born in Barcelona on 24 February 1952. When she was young, her father regularly took her and her siblings to the Camp Nou to watch Barcelona play. Cabecerán had an older sister and a younger brother, and played street football with her brother, though she soon knew she wanted to play club football.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAn amateur footballer and Barça fan, Cabecerán approached Barcelona president Agustí Montal Costa in November 1970 with the proposition of a women's team. Cabecerán was the girlfriend of FC Barcelona player García Castany, and had become a friend of María Dinarés, the widow of Vicente Piera. Dinarés encouraged her to talk to Montal, who was positive if ambiguous, saying that FC Barcelona would support a women's team if she had one; word of her plan reached the Barcelona fan magazine Revista Barcelonista, who suggested she run a notice in the magazine asking for players, the same tactic used by Joan Gamper to form FC Barcelona.\n\nCabecerán was the first captain of Barcelona Femení, known in their first match on Christmas Day 1970 as Selecció Ciutat de Barcelona. She played as a false 9 in the game, which ended in a 0–0 draw and went to a penalty shoot-out that saw each team shoot rounds of three penalties: Cabecerán converted both of her penalty kicks to take the shoot-out to sudden death, with Maite Rodríguez scoring to win for Barcelona. Cabecerán was then handed the trophy to a standing ovation from the 60,000 crowd at the Camp Nou. She lined up as a centre forward in Barcelona's next match, on Three Kings' Day 1971, not scoring in the 1–2 loss.\nBy this point, Barcelona had rapidly become the most popular women's football team, and were one of the four major Catalan teams to take part in the Copa Catalunya Pernod in March 1971 – now known as Penya Femenina Barcelonista, although promoted as C.F. Barcelona. They lost 1–2 in the cup final against rivals Espanyol at the Camp Nou. Cabecerán's only confirmed goal for Barcelona was scored in their second match of the 1971–72 league (the Campeonato de Cataluña), a 16–0 victory over Calella on 16 May 1971. This scoreline led Barcelona to pack out the away stadium for their next match, and to become known as \"unbeatable\"; they were still unbeaten in the league by 23 June 1971, when Cabecerán announced that she was \"hanging up her boots\" and leaving football. Due to her impact on the sport and individual popularity, Mundo Deportivo wrote that her contributions would always stay in the memories of fans.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nShe married García Castany in 1971, becoming a housewife. They had two daughters, Patricia (b. ~1973) and Ana (b. 1975), who both played football in Vidreres; Ana García-Castany Cabecerán went on to be a professional football goalkeeper for teams including Espanyol and, later, was a local politician in Lloret de Mar.\nCabecerán died on 11 January 2018, aged 65, in Girona. A minute of silence was held before the Barcelona Femení match on 14 January 2018. In April 2024, football journalist and Barcelona historian Guillem Balagué proposed that the women's Joan Gamper Trophy be renamed the Imma Cabecerán Trophy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Swinney formed the Swinney government on 8 May 2024, following his appointment as first minister of Scotland at the Court of Session.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 29 April 2024, Humza Yousaf announced his intention to resign the leadership of the Scottish National Party, and as First Minister. Swinney announced his candidacy for the internal leadership contest, and was elected unopposed. Shona Robison resigned as Deputy First Minister on 8 May in favour of Kate Forbes, but was re-appointed as Swinney's Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government.\nThe majority of Swinney's cabinet was previously part of Humza Yousaf's previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robinson as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of Màiri McAllan's responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic. Robinson was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.\nAdditionally, only one new junior minister joined Swinney's government, former minister Ivan McKee, with the number of junior ministerial posts being reduced from 16 to 14. The portfolio of Minister for Employment and Investment was created, with Tom Arthur appointed to the role. The ministers for independence and culture were abolished, with their incumbents Jamie Hepburn and Kaukab Stewart moved to other positions. Joe FitzPatrick's local government position was abolished, and he therefore departed government along with Equalities Minister Emma Roddick and Parliamentary Business Minister George Adam.\nThe Scottish Parliament formally approved the appointments of Kate Forbes and Ivan McKee on 9 May 2024.\n\n\n== Cabinet ==\n\n\n=== May 2024 – present ===\n\n\n== List of junior ministers ==\n\n\n=== May 2024 to present ===\n\n\n== Scottish law officers ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Amjad Ali Khandkar is a Bangladeshi cameraman and videographer of the Bangladesh Television. He is known for recording the speech delivered on 7 March, 1971 by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nHe was awarded the 2022 Ekushey Padak for his contributions to the Liberation War.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAmjad Ali was born in Harirampur Upazila of Manikganj. Currently, he lives in Genda area of Savar Upazila.\nIn 1968, he got a job in the film division of the Film Development Corporation of the Ministry of Information. In 1971, he recorded the March 7 speech on the instructions of the then director of the film division, Abul Khair. On the day of Bangabandhu's homecoming, he went to house Dhanmondi 32 and filmed. He also filmed the death scene of Bangabandhu's mother. On 29 June 2004, he retired as Controller-Chief Cameraman of Bangladesh Television.\n\n\n== Speech delivered on 7 March 1971 ==\nOn 7 March 1971, Bangabandhu's desired speech was banned on radio and television. Ignoring that ban, some people recorded and saved the speech. One of them is Amjad Ali Khandkar of Savar. In 1971, he was an assistant cameraman in the film department. In 1971, some of them recorded Bangabandhu's 7 March speech. After the recording, the recorded film of the speech was kept in the office that night. As there was no lab in the office at that time, the film was printed from FDC. After the Pakistani attack on 25 March, director Abul Khair called him on 9 April and asked him to take a black 42-inch trunk (box) out of Dhaka. In that trunk were some photographs of Bangabandhu and a video cassette of his 7 March speech. He took that trunk and went out through the second gate of the secretariat with the help of a Bengali officer. He risked his life and reached Swarighat in front of the Pakistan Army. He crossed the river with the trunk. After he reached Jinjira, he climbed on the roof of a bus from the bus stand and got down to a bus stand in Buxganj. As there was no vehicle there, he lifted the trunk on a horse and walked himself to Majid Darogar's house, which is about 4 to 5 kilometers away, in Joypara village of Dohar thana and kept the trunk. In the meantime, as the Pakistani army had reached Doha, they hid the trunk inside the big paddy field of two brothers named Amed Khan and Danesh Khan of Charkosha village further from Doha. Later, Abul Khair went to India and contacted the Indian High Commission and Mukti Bahini and he took the trunk from that paddy field and sent it to India through Mukti Bahini. The video cassette of Bangabandhu's March 7 speech was in India during the liberation war. After the independence of the country, when Abul Khair returned to the country, he brought it with him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Internal migration in Brazil occurs mainly for economic reasons and ecological disasters. Internal migration involves the movement of people within the same territory, which can be between regions, states or municipalities. It does not affect the total number of inhabitants in a country, but it does change the regions involved in this process. In Brazil, economic factors exert the greatest influence on migratory flows, as the capitalist production model creates privileged areas for industries, forcing people to move from one place to another in search of better living conditions and jobs to meet their basic survival needs.\nSome examples of internal migration in Brazil occurred in the 1960s, when the droughts devastated the Northeast of Brazil, leading thousands of people to abandon their homes in the Brazilian hinterland due to the lack of agricultural alternatives and social policies in the region. At the end of the 19th century, northeasterners migrated to the North of Brazil because of the rubber cycle. \nIn the 1970s, migrants from the Northeast and the South left in search of a better life in the Southeast, Brazil's only industrial center at the time.\n\n\n== History ==\nMigration across Brazilian territory has been associated with economic factors since the time of colonization by Europeans. At the end of the 18th century, after the end of the sugar cane cycle in the Northeast and the beginning of the gold cycle in Minas Gerais and Goiás, there was a huge movement of people towards Brazil's new economic center. At the end of the 19th century, the rubber cycle attracted a large number of migrants to the Amazon region. At the time, the coffee cycle and the industrialization process made the Southeast a major attraction for migrants, who left their region in search of jobs or better salaries.\nThe process of large-scale rural exodus has intensified. In rural areas, misery and poverty, aggravated by the lack of infrastructure, the concentration of land and the mechanization of agricultural activities, lead the large rural population to be attracted by the prospect of an urban job to improve their standard of living. In addition, access to services and commerce in urban areas has become the main factor attracting people to the big cities.\nBetween the 1940s and 1990s, the cities had no supply of jobs to match demand and the urban economy expanded at the same rate as migration. As a result, unemployment and underemployment in the service sector grew due to the increase in the number of informal workers and street vendors. The lack of investment and planning in urban infrastructure contributed to the emergence of slums and urban invasions. Currently, the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro register a greater outflow of population from the metropolises towards the medium-sized cities of the interior. Cities in the countryside, besides experiencing a period of economic growth, offer a better quality of life to the population.\nFrom the 1970s onwards, the North and Central-West regions became the focus of internal migration, reflecting the March to the West policy that began in the 1940s, the incentives offered by jobs in the region and the construction of Brasilia in 1960. Today, the majority of migrations occur within the same region. In addition, some states, which traditionally had more emigration, have become regions of immigration, such as Pernambuco, Bahia, Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBrazilian northeastern migration\nDemographics of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Luke Nankervis (born 25 May 2003) is a professional Australian rules footballer who plays for the Adelaide Crows in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\n\n== AFL career ==\nLuke Nankervis, who had played eight games for Sandringham in 2021, was drafted by Adelaide with the second selection of the 2022 pre-season draft.\nBefore the 2023 season, Luke Nankervis extended his contract with the Crows for an additional two seasons, securing his place in the playing list until at least the end of 2025. He averaged 21.5 disposals and a goal during the 2022 SANFL finals series. Prior to 2023, Nankervis had played almost exclusively as a half-forward flanker playing in Adelaide's reserves team. He moved to a more defensive role during the 2023 SANFL season, playing as a running half-back. He excelled in the role change, and earned an senior debut in round 19 of the 2023 season against Melbourne at the MCG. Nankervis collected 16 disposals as a half-back flanker on debut. In 2024, Nankervis is becoming one of Adelaide's more consistent young talents, slowly shifting into a role on the wing. He is currently ranked elite for marks among midfielders, averaging 6.4 across five games so far in 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNankervis has two older brothers – Ryan and Joel – and a younger sister, Milly. Since October 2022, he lives with fellow Victorians and current teammates Josh Rachele and Jake Soligo.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nUpdated to round 8, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLuke Nankervis's profile on the official website of the Adelaide Football Club\nLuke Nankervis's playing statistics from AFL Tables \nLuke Nankervis at AustralianFootball.com",

Osborn brought in fellow promoters Ted Hornsby and Jim Streets to help with the transition.\nThe search for a new site for the 1979 season ended when the North Lincolnshire Council agreed to the building of a stadium on a seven-acre area of land in the south east of Scunthorpe, near the cooling towers of the steelworks. The area was known as Ashby Ville due to the name of the nearby lake. The construction started in early part of 1979, with floodlights and a portable stand being added in an attempt to get the stadium ready for an Easter opening.\nAfter a successful application to the Speedway Control Board for a licence, the stadium duly opened by Easter, with the first fixture being held on 6 May 1979, featuring a challenge match against Middlesbrough Bears. The speedway team changed their name from the Saints to the Stags to mark the new era.\nIn January 1985, the now speedway promoter Tony Nicholls secured a 35-year freehold lease and announced optimistic plans to build an auction centre, restaurant and transport cafe and also bring stockcars and BMX racing to Ashby Ville. However, although work started on improving the facilities, Nicholls ran into financial problems and the speedway team was disbanded during May 1985.\nDespite the end of speedway at the venue, it still held BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars and there were hopes to introduce greyhound racing. The Borough council repossessed the site from Nicholls, who had debts of over £10,000 with them.\nThe stadium then sat empty for several years and was marked as a possible venue for a new football stadium for Scunthorpe United in 1986 and as a music concert venue in 1988. It also served as a home venue for the Scunthorpe Steelers American Football team in the late 1980s and as a banger racing circuit in the early 1990s.\nBy 1992, the stadium was earmarked for demolition because plans for a new shopping centre materialised. The Lakeside shopping complex was subsequently constructed and the stadium demolished in 1993.\n\n\n== References ==",

It contains a very simplified grammar and a very limited vocabulary. Varissuomi is primarily used by the younger generations of foreign families who speak different languages to communicate between each other, although some have started using English instead.\nTheir form of speech has also spread into residents of Varissuo who have an ethnically Finnish background.\n\n\n== History ==\nVarissuo has a high amount of individuals with a foreign background, being up to 90% of those who are recently starting school. For many young students, the only place where Finnish used is school, leading to a weakened understanding of standard Finnish. This has caused to the communities to start using a distinct form of Finnish, given the name \"varissuomi\", containing a very small vocabulary with very simple grammar.\n\n\n== Status ==\nThere have been many proposals to make immigrant communities around Varissuo learn standard Finnish, including the idea to replace Swedish classes with Finnish classes, or more radical ones such as forcefully moving students into other schools to expose them into standard Finnish.\nMembers of the Finns Party have expressed fears of Varissuomi also spreading more into ethnic Finnish communities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bielsko-Biała City Hall is a Neo-Renaissance, historic city hall located at City Hall Square in Bielsko-Biała, administratively within the boundaries of the Biała Śródmieście district and within the registration area of Biała Miasto. It was built between 1895 and 1897 according to the design by Emanuel Rost. Originally, it housed the city hall of Biała, the Communal Savings Bank, as well as several other institutions and apartments for officials. Since 1951, it has been the seat of the Mayor, the City Council, and some departments of the Municipal Office in Bielsko-Biała.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian authorities in Biała recognized that the city hall, built in 1827 and situated in the market square (nowadays Wojska Polskiego Square), was insufficient for the rapidly developing city. It was decided to construct a new building, with sponsorship secured from the Communal Savings Bank, a local bank founded in 1883.\nIn February 1894, the management of the Communal Savings Bank announced an architectural competition for the design of the building, which was intended to serve a dual function – housing the bank's headquarters and the city hall. The competition requirements precisely defined the expectations for the modern building, emphasizing both functionality and the grandeur of the city hall. It was to be a municipal public building with a recognizable landmark tower with a clock. The organization of the competition was entrusted to the Austrian Association of Engineers and Architects (German: Österreichischer Ingenieur- und Architektenverein). The jury consisted of three Viennese architects: Ludwig Wächtler, Franz Neumann, and Herman Helmer.\n\nOn 24 July 1894, the jury selected the winning design for execution from eight proposals. Only two of them are known today: the project under the slogan Honoris Causa by Carl Korn and Coalition 2 by Emanuel Rost. Rost's project won the competition and was chosen for implementation, undergoing several post-competition revisions and changes. Korn's proposal ranked second, probably due to the building's excessive size and the absence of the tower, which was stipulated in the competition conditions.\nConstruction work began on 1 September 1895, and was completed on 30 September 1897. Ignatz Ungwer supervised the construction. The construction costs, initially estimated at 200,000 Austro-Hungarian krones, eventually amounted to 612,000 krones. The Communal Savings Bank and the municipal authorities, led by Mayor Johann Rosner, moved into the new building on 17 October 1897. Soon after, it also became the headquarters of the police and a 20-person municipal guard unit, with a prison located in the basement. The Civic Society occupied one room, next to which, founded on 3 December 1904, was the Bielsko-Biała Museum and Castle. The top floor was designated for officials' residences. A municipal park was established west of the building in 1897.\nDue to the lack of space in the cramped urban structures of Biała, the city hall was erected on sparsely built land south of the city center, at the confluence of the Biała and Niwka rivers, near Feuerwehrplatz (Fire Brigade Square). The location of the building also had an ideological aspect. It was adjacent to the Lipnik Manor, the former seat of the Lipnik starostas, on whom the citizens of Biała were dependent in the 18th century. The imposing building clearly overshadowed the starostas' manor, which a few years earlier, in 1893, had been transferred by Archduke Albrecht to the convent sisters for use as a monastery and school. The city hall thus became a manifestation of local self-government, which in the 19th century overcame the feudal system.\nIn 1951, with the merger of Bielsko and Biała into one city, the former Biała city hall became the seat of the Mayor, the Municipal Office (currently some offices, including the Customer Service Office, are located in buildings at 6 and 7 City Hall Square), and the Municipal Council of Bielsko-Biała.\nIn 1993, conservation work began on the clock tower and roof. Two years earlier, in 1991, the old clock on the tower was replaced with a new electronic one, while the former historic clock was handed over to a museum. The main restoration work, however, took place in between 1996 and 1997, and included both the facade and the interiors. On the centenary of its existence, the city hall was restored to its original 19th-century appearance, largely based on old photographs and Emanuel Rost's design drawings.\nIn April 2008, the National Bank of Poland issued a commemorative coin from the series 32 Historic Cities of Poland with a face value of 2 PLN, featuring an image of the Bielsko-Biała City Hall on the reverse side. In 2009, the Bielsko-Biała City Hall was featured on a postcard representing the country during the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building covers an area of 1278 m2 and was constructed on the plan of an elongated rectangle. The symmetrical structure is accentuated by the central avant-corps of the vestibule and the Council Chamber, topped with a separate gambrel roof, as well as smaller corner avant-corps (the northeast one transitioning into a tower). The western side of the building features two short wings, giving it the character of a horseshoe layout. In the southern part, a square well with a side staircase is located.\nThe city hall building consists of three storeys. The articulation of the walls highlights the lower part – the basement and the ground floor – in the form of a rusticated socle with a stone cladding. The first floor served as the representative piano nobile. It was emphasized by deeply projecting, rhythmically spaced window abutments, contrasting with the delicate, flat composition of the top floor with shallow divisions, featuring herm pilasters and ornamental panels between the windows.\nThe arrangement of the individual facades relative to each other is clearly hierarchical. The rear, western part of the building is the most modest. As one approaches the facade, the articulation and ornamentation become denser, pointing to the central avant-corps, which has the most architectural details and ideological content.\n\nIt follows the principle of a tripartite arcade loggia: three entrance portals and a traditional proclamation balcony – an indispensable element of 19th-century city hall architecture, although devoid of its original function and serving purely as a decorative element. The wall divisions feature doubled Ionic pilasters and dense ornamentation with Neo-Renaissance motifs of fittings, cartouches, floral festoons, and the city's coat of arms entwined with symbolic palm and laurel branches, heads of young men and women in Renaissance attire placed between faux French doors and oculi above. The entire composition is crowned with a gable featuring obelisks typical of northern Neo-Renaissance. In the center stands a stone sculpture of the goddess Eirene with a cornucopia and a small Plutus, the god of wealth, by her side. At the highest point of the gable, there is a heraldic shield with a bee motif, considered a symbol of industriousness and prudence. This symbolism relates to the existence of the Communal Savings Bank in the building but also glorifies bourgeois industriousness, peace, and prosperity, depicted as the most important elements of the contemporary cultural and civilizational order. The compositional layout of the central projection has an analogy in the facade of the Vienna Palace of Justice, built in 1883 according to the design of Alexander Wielemans von Monteforte.\nThe composition of the city hall facade is based on the principles of symmetry and axiality, although the original layout was disrupted by the addition of the clock tower, which was an integral element of 19th-century city halls but devoid of practical function. Its significance was purely symbolic – it symbolized the sovereignty of municipal self-government and the equality of its status with churches and castles.\nThe clock tower is a natural extension of the northeastern avant-corps. It is 52 m tall, measured from the base. It is massive, square, covered with a bulbous tented roof with a long gallery and a spire surrounded by four corner domes. It has a loggia with corner bay windows. The tower houses a computerized clock with a chime, which plays the city anthem every three hours. The date of completion of the construction, 1897, is displayed in decorative framing around the window located at the base of the tower.\nThe architecture of the Bielsko-Biała City Hall clearly references the forms of the Viennese city palace and the emerging \"rental palace\", i.e., a luxury tenement with features of a city palace residence. Emanuel Rost introduced rarely used northern motifs in Austria, such as steep roofs and ornamental fittings and curving cartouches. As a result, while the city hall shares many similarities with Viennese architecture, it also features distinctively northern elements.\n\n\n== Interiors ==\n\n\n=== Vestibule and staircase ===\n\nThe vestibule is located on the ground floor of the city hall. Along with the Council Chamber, it is separated from the building's mass, forming the central avant-corps.\nIt features groin-barrel vaults supported by eight Tuscan granite columns, arranged in pairs. The space creates an atmosphere of solemnity and austere simplicity. The vestibule opens up to the sides, leading towards the rooms on the ground floor, which housed the Communal Savings Bank in the past.\nOn the axis, a tunnel-like extension of the stairway leads to the staircase. The staircase is located in the western part of the building, in a square space covered with a mirrored vault with lunettes. Traces of the original plafond still exist. The walls feature a monumental, Neo-Renaissance articulation with three-arched Ionic divisions. The stairs split in a palatial manner into two mirrored flights with a marble single-rail balustrade. The staircase, connecting the vestibule to the first floor, is enclosed by a representative three-arched opening leading straight to the Council Chamber and other rooms on the first floor, which have housed the municipal administration from the beginning. The space of the staircase clearly separates the functions of the building, which were once different on each floor. The solemnity of the vestibule transitions into a lighter, Ionian-Neo-Renaissance style in the latter part, with pastel-colored marble balustrades. A separate, two-flight staircase leads to the second floor, which was once residential, located in the southern part of the building.\nA similar arrangement of the vestibule and staircase can be found, among others, in one of the Vienna tenement buildings on Stadiongasse, built in 1883, one of the early works of Otto Wagner, and in the University of Vienna building designed by Heinrich von Ferstel in 1884.\n\n\n=== Council Chamber ===\n\nThe Council Chamber is located on the first floor, in the piano nobile zone, and together with the ground-floor vestibule, it is separated from the building's mass, forming the central avant-corps. An announcement balcony adjoins it. Both the central location of the Council Chamber and its architectural form are one of the hallmarks of the \"city hallness\" of such buildings in the 19th century. From the very beginning, it has served as the meeting room of the city council.\nThe Council Chamber, 8.6 m high, covers an area of 160 m2. It is the most decorative element of the interiors of the Bielsko-Biała City Hall. Its interior is covered with a mirrored vault with lunettes, which was originally decorated with murals, now nonexistent. The walls are filled with dense architectural articulation, incorporating elements of mural decoration. The articulation of the walls is carried out with Ionic pilasters on tall socles, supporting an elaborate entablature containing decorative panels in cartouche frames in the cornice zone, and oculi in the eastern wall. Epitaph-like aediculae are inserted between the socles. In the center of these compositions was originally a portrait gallery of the mayors of Biała, removed in 1945. The eastern wall is pierced by porte-fenêtre windows. The opposite western wall houses the entrance at the bottom and a gallery for the public at the top.\nThe direction of the composition of the Council Chamber was determined by the northern wall. In its center, there was once a powerful composition outlined by Ionic columns, closed with a semi-oval, interrupted abutment containing an oval frame, where from 1897 to 1918 there was a bust of the Austrian-Hungarian emperor, Franz Joseph I. In the frieze zone, the city's coat of arms was displayed in an ornate cartouche.\nThe bust of the Austrian emperor and the portrait gallery of mayors created dual ideological references: loyalty to the state and references to local heritage.\nThe compositional elements of the Council Chamber resemble, in proportion, the architecture of the Natural History Museum in Vienna, built in 1891.\n\n\n== City Hall at present ==\nIn the city hall, there are offices for the Mayor and his deputies, as well as the City Council Office in Bielsko-Biała. The Council Chamber serves as a meeting room. Additionally, the following departments of the Municipal Office are located here:\n\nThe Administrative and Economic Department of the Municipal Office is the building administrator.\nThe city hall is open during the Municipal Office's working hours, which are Monday to Wednesday from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM, Thursdays from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and Fridays from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. The viewing tower is not accessible to tourists (entry is only possible with permission).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Municipal Office in Bielsko-Biała\nGallery of old photos of the city hall\nVirtual tour – vestibule and Council Hall\nVirtual panorama: Session Hall, staircase\nCity hall on polska-org.pl website",

        "content": "Nobilis was a French video game publishing and distribution company founded in 2001 in the Lyon metropolitan area and dissolved in 2013. Nobilis also distributed and produced accessories for consoles under the Subsonic brand, whose activity continued after the judicial liquidation of Nobilis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and development ===\nNobilis was founded in 2001 in the Lyon metropolitan area by Arnaud Blacher, Pierre de Laporte, and Eric Pernelle, three former directors of Infogrames. The company's headquarters were initially located in Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, then moved to Dardilly and a few years later to Limonest.\nAs a public limited company, the company was a publisher and distributor of video games for PC and consoles (Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PSP, GameCube, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance). The company also distributed and produced accessories for consoles under the Subsonic brand, particularly for Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, GameCube, PSP, and Nintendo DS platforms.\nDuring its early years, Nobilis experienced rapid growth in its business. The company recorded a turnover of 3.5 million euros in its first fiscal year. By 2003, the company employed 30 people with an annual turnover of 16 million euros. In 2005, the company achieved a turnover of 20 million euros and claimed to have been profitable since its inception. In the context of this rapid expansion, Nobilis opened subsidiaries in Madrid, Brussels, and Rome.\n\n\n=== Financial difficulties and liquidation ===\nIn 2009, Nobilis faced financial difficulties in a deteriorating video game market in France, particularly in the Nintendo DS game distribution segment. Between late 2008 and summer 2009, Nobilis canceled six publishing projects commissioned to development studios and laid off 15 to 20% of its 65 employees, in addition to voluntary departures. Two members of Nobilis affected by this wave of departures founded the publishing company Zallag at that time.\nIn early 2011, Nobilis announced a strategic reorientation of its activities, focusing on the distribution of console accessories and the publishing of digital video games accessible via a web browser. The accessory distribution business was profitable: in the 2010–2011 fiscal year, Subsonic generated an annual pre-tax profit of €426,000.\nDespite this strategic reorientation, Nobilis was placed in receivership in September 2011. Unable to find a solution for takeover, the company underwent judicial liquidation on March 8, 2013, ceasing its activities. The Subsonic brand, which was generating profitable activity, was preserved by being transformed into a separate company. Arnaud Blacher, Pierre de Laporte, and Eric Pernelle retained management positions within Subsonic after Nobilis' liquidation.\n\n\n== Published and Distributed Games ==\nAccording to the database of JeuxVideo.fr, Nobilis would have published and/or distributed a total of 206 video game titles between 2001 and 2010. Some of these games include:\n\n2002: Hotel Giant (PC) – Distributor\n2003: Hearts of Iron (PC) – Distributor\n2004: Star Academy (PC) – Publisher\n2004: Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Silver Earring (PC) – Distributor\n2005: Caméra Café, le jeu (PC) – Publisher and distributor\n2005: Wild Water Adrenaline featuring Salomon (PlayStation 2) – Distributor\n2006: The Secrets of Da Vinci: The Forbidden Manuscript (PC) – Publisher and distributor\n2006: The Secrets of Atlantis: The Sacred Legacy (PC) – Publisher and distributor\n2006: Destination: Treasure Island (PC) – Publisher and distributor\n2007: Napoleon's Campaigns (PC) – Publisher and distributor\n2007: Mountain Bike Adrenaline featuring Salomon (PlayStation 2) – Publisher and distributor\n2008: King's Bounty: The Legend – Distributor\n2008: Moto Racer DS (DS) – Publisher and distributor\n2008: My Baby Boy and My Baby Girl (DS) – Publisher\n2009: Case Closed: The Mirapolis Investigation (Wii) – Distributor\n2009: Crime Scene (DS) – Publisher\n2010: Killing Floor (PC and Mac OS X) – Distributor\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ZiMAD is an American game developer and publisher founded in 2009 in San Francisco, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2009, the XIM group of companies, which develops software in the fields of fintech, aviation, and healthcare, opened XIMAD. It focused on developing games for mobile platforms. The first XIMAD headquarters was located in San Francisco, California. In 2016, the company was renamed to ZiMAD.\nIn 2011, the mobile puzzle game Magic Jigsaw Puzzles was released globally. As of 2023, the project has over 120 million downloads and partnerships with internationally renowned IPs, including LIFE magazine, Disney, Nickelodeon, Sony Pictures, Cartoon Network, and National Geographic.\nSince 2012, ZiMAD has continued to develop the Magic Jigsaw Puzzles project and has released and published other projects such as the Bubble Birds series, My Museum Story, Magic Cross Stitch, and others.\nIn 2020, ZiMAD focused on developing its M&A direction, within which a promising board game, Domino Online, was acquired. The acquisition of this project helped the company diversify its portfolio and strengthen its position in the market.\nMobile games became one of the most popular forms of entertainment during the 2020 pandemic, when many people were forced to stay home. ZiMAD noted an increase in downloads and revenue due to this trend. After the pandemic, the company almost entirely switched to the remote work format.\nIn 2022, due to the growth of the team, ZiMAD opened an office in Serbia to strengthen its presence in the European region and take advantage of more opportunities for business development. Also, in 2021, the company's headquarters moved to Florida.\nThe experience of operating Magic Jigsaw Puzzles prompted the company to expand the genre diversity of its projects. In 2022, ZiMAD released Jigsaw Puzzle Villa, a mobile puzzle game with narrative elements. The project was launched on Android on September 1 and on iOS on October 28. The game's script was developed by Brunette Games, a US-based studio that develops narratives for a variety of casual studios.\n\n\n== Games ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "John Swinney's term as First Minister of Scotland began on 8 May 2024, when he was formally sworn into office at the Court of Session, upon Humza Yousaf's resignation.\nSwinney previously served as leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2000 to 2004, when the party was in opposition. Yousaf announced his resignation as party leader and first minister on 29 April 2024, amid a government crisis. Swinney announced his leadership bid on 2 May, but faced potential leadership challenges from Kate Forbes and Graeme McCormick. Both candidates eventually decided not to stand and endorsed Swinney, who was therefore elected unopposed as the SNP party leader on 6 May.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFollowing the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP had been in a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. In April 2024, Yousaf terminated the agreement, following changes to landmark climate policy by Màiri McAllan, Cabinet Secretary for Wellbeing Economy, Net Zero and Energy. Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, co-leaders of the Greens, announced they would support a no confidence motion in Yousaf. Amid the crisis, Yousaf announced his resignation as party leader and first minister on 29 April.\n\n\n== Leadership election ==\n\nOn 2 May, Swinney launched his leadership bid, after Kate Forbes, who was a serious contender to become leader, declined to stand and endorsed him.\nGraeme McCormick announced he would challenge Swinney for the leadership, saying he had the 100 nominations on 5 May. Just hours later, he withdrew and endorsed Swinney, becoming the presumptive nominee.\nOn 6 May, with no other candidates put forward, Swinney was elected as party leader unopposed.\n\n\n== Tenure ==\n\n\n=== Government formation ===\n\nSwinney was officially sworn into office as First Minister of Scotland on 8 May 2024 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by King Charles III.\nThe majority of Swinney's cabinet were previously part of Humza Yousaf's previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of Màiri McAllan's responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic. Robison was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.\nSwinney's cabinet met for the first time on 10 May 2024, with the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government John-Paul Marks and the Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain also attending the cabinet meeting. Speaking about the first meeting of his cabinet since becoming First Minister, Swinney said \"today, my colleagues and I embark on a new chapter as we collectively work to build a better, brighter future for the people of Scotland. It is my greatest honour to lead us forward on that journey – one that will drive economic growth, tackle the climate crisis and eradicate the scourge of child poverty in our country once and for all\".\n\n\n=== Debut First Ministers Questions ===\n\nSwinney's first First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament as First Minister occurred on Thursday 9 May 2024, during which Swinney's record on education during his tenure as education secretary under former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was attacked by both Anas Sarwar (leader, Scottish Labour Party) and Douglas Ross (leader, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party). Ross asked if Swinney would \"recommit to increasing teacher numbers by 3,500\", whilst Sarwar asked Swinney if he \"could save 450 Glasgow teachers whose jobs are under threat\". Swinney confirmed to the Scottish Parliament chamber that, as First Minister, he would work with local councils to \"deliver on education\".\nHis decision to appoint Kate Forbes as the Deputy First Minister was criticised by Patrick Harvie, the co–leader of the Scottish Greens, who asked if the SNP was going back to \"the repressive values of 1950s with the return of Kate Forbes to the cabinet\". Swinney was dismissive of the claims made by Harvie and defended his decision on appointing Forbes as Deputy First Minister, claiming that Forbes \"had delivered progressive taxation when she was finance secretary\".\n\n\n=== First actions ===\nUpon becoming First Minister, Swinney addressed issues within NHS Scotland, the country's national health service. He recognised that the NHS in Scotland is \"operating under sustained pressure\", further adding that \" I am absolutely committed to working with health boards to improve standards – starting with our recent £30 million investment to drive down waiting times\". Additionally, Swinney also pledged support to infrastructure projects across Scotland, stating that the Scottish Government \"will also build on our investment and track record on major infrastructure projects. I’m pleased to also be able to visit one example of that record being the Levenmouth Rail Link, a line which will reconnect local communities for the first time in 50 years, and make a real contribution to the Government’s net-zero transport ambitions. I pledge that I will stand with Scotland’s businesses, large and small, and do whatever I can to help them to grow, innovate, and boost our economy for the benefit of those who live here\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mir Syed Hussain Simnani was an Indian Sufi saint from the 8th century Hijri, known for his role in the spread of Islam in the Kashmir Valley. He hailed from Simnan in Iran and is celebrated for his philanthropic mission and spiritual teachings in South Kashmir's Kulgam district. He is a descendant of the Muhammad through his grandson Imam Hussain, being the 16th in direct descent from Ali. He was the cousin of the Sufi saint Mir Syed Ali Hamdani and the younger brother of Syed Taj ud Din Hamdani.\n\n\n== Early life and background ==\nHis arrival in Kashmir, along with other Sayyids during the reign of Sultan Shahab ud din, greatly influenced the region's religious landscape. He chose Kulgam as his permanent abode, where he was engaged in spreading Islam and was eventually buried at a spot on a cliff overlooking the river Veshaw.\n\n\n== Spiritual life ==\nHe played a significant role in the spread of Islam in Kashmir through his missionary work and spiritual influence. Here are some key contributions he made:\n\nMissionary Work: He was part of a group of hundreds of missionaries who accompanied Mir Syed Ali Hamdani to propagate Islam in Kashmir. His efforts gave a considerable boost to the conversion of the people of the valley to Islam.\nSpiritual Influence: He was known for his piety, abstinence, and spiritual powers. His presence and teachings had a profound impact on the local population, leading many to embrace Islam.\nPhilanthropic Mission: He engaged in philanthropic activities in Kulgam, which helped in establishing a positive image of Islam and its teachings among the local communities.\nCultural Integration: He connected the global mystical culture of Islam, or Tasawwuf, with the local mystic culture of Kashmir, known as Rishism. This integration resulted in the permanence and dominance of a unique Islamic mystical culture in the region.\nRoyal Influence: Sultan Shahab ud din, the ruler of Kashmir at the time, became a follower of Mir Syed Hussain Simnani, which likely facilitated the spread of Islam due to the king's endorsement.\nHis legacy is still celebrated today, and his shrine in Kulgam remains a place of pilgrimage for many devotees.\n\n\n== Works ==\nHe is attributed to the book titled \"Hazrat Mir Sayid Muhammad Hussain Simnani : Qalandar-i-Sadat\". This book provides insights into his life, his journey to Kashmir, his role in reforming the thoughts and actions of the Sultans of Kashmir, and his efforts in relieving locals from superstitious beliefs through his preaching and miraculous powers. It's a valuable resource for those interested in the history of Sufism and the spread of Islam in Kashmir.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kakira–Kisumu Expressway, also Kenya–Uganda Highway, is a road in Uganda and Kenya, connecting the cities of Kakira and Iganga in Uganda to Busia, Malaba and Kisumu in Kenya.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe road starts at Kakira, Uganda and makes its way eastwards through Iganga, Bugiri and Busitema. At Busitema the road takes a right turn and travels southeastwards through Busia and enters Kenya. The road then continues southeast through Matayos and Kisian to end in Kisumu. The road distance between Kakira, Uganda and Kisumu, Kenya is approximately 221 kilometres (137 mi).\nA second leg of this road branches off at Busitema and continues eastwards to the Kenyan border at Malaba, a distance of about 42 kilometres (26 mi). The total distance within Uganda is approximately 143 kilometres (89 mi), while that in Kenya is about 120 kilometres (75 mi), for a total road distance of about 263 kilometres (163 mi).\n\n\n== Upgrade to double carriageway ==\nAs a preliminary to the rehabilitation and expansion of this single carriageway road to class II bitumen and widening to double carriageway, feasibility studies funded by the African Development Bank are underway.\nThe contract for the feasibility studies was awarded to GOPA Infra Gmbh of Germany and ITEC Limited of Kenya, at a contract price of US$1,499,587.00. The studies are expected to last 18 months starting in May 2024.\nThe entire length of the road will be improved to class II bitumen standard, with culverts and drainage channels. The section of this road between Busia, Kenya and Kisian, Kenya measuring 104 kilometres (65 mi) will be expanded to dual carriageway (two lanes in each direction). The road improvement project is being undertaken by the East African Community, as part of decongesting the Northern Corridor. The work includes the improvent of the Malaba and Busia \"One Stop Border Point\"s (OSBP)s and the conversion of Lwakhakha to an OSBP.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of roads in Kenya\nList of roads in Uganda\nKapchorwa–Suam Road\nSuam–Endebess–Kitale–Eldoret Road\nEast African Community\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKisumu-Uganda expressway feasibility assessment kicks off As At 30 April 2024.\nNorthern Corridor Advances Toward Dual Carriageway with $1.4M As At 29 April 2024.",

        "content": "Amirkabir NewsLetter (in Persian: خبرنامه ی امیرکبیر) is a student media outlet that began its activities at Amirkabir University of Technology in the late 1990s. Currently, this outlet is active on social networks such as Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter.\nAmirkabir NewsLetter has formed at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). This online outlet is active in the areas of student human rights issues, documenting human rights violations in Iranian universities, reporting on the status of universities, publishing news and analyses related to security crackdowns in Iranian universities, and publishing critical articles on the performance of the Islamic Republic in the field of higher education centers in Iran.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Amirkabir NewsLetter dates back to its origins as the newsletter of the Islamic Association of Amirkabir Students (Polytechnic Association), known initially as AKU-News and published in paper form. This media outlet was formed by activists of the student movement at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), with the assistance of members of the Office for Strengthening Unity, and each year, with the selection of a new central council for the Polytechnic Association, its editorial board members were determined. In Khordad 1385 (May/June 2006), the responsible person for the Amirkabir NewsLetter website and the secretary of the Islamic Association of Polytechnic were detained by the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic. One of the charges against the responsible person of the newsletter was launching the Amirkabir NewsLetter website, for which they were sentenced to two years of imprisonment and 148 lashes.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nFollowing the nocturnal destruction of the Polytechnic Association office with a bulldozer and security crackdowns on the students of this university, Amirkabir NewsLetter continued its activities unofficially. It became one of the influential media outlets of the Iranian student movement in the latter half of the 2000s. With the arrest of several Polytechnic students in the case of Amirkabir NewsLetter organizers in 2008 and the blocking of Amirkabir NewsLetter coinciding with the blocking of Facebook prior to the presidential elections in 2009, the activities of this outlet decreased.\nAmirkabir NewsLetter resumed its activities in 2015 through its Telegram channel. Its activities intensified concurrently with the emergence of the Women-Life-Freedom uprising. By publishing various reports on the situation of Iranian universities and the suppression of universities, including Amirkabir University of Technology, it shed light on human rights violations in Iranian universities at the international level.\nDuring the summer and fall of 2023, Amirkabir NewsLetter released classified documents regarding the recruitment of faculty members in line with the Islamic Revolution (aligned with the Islamic Regime's policies) in universities, triggering widespread reactions. The publication of a list of 2843 summoned students to disciplinary committees of various universities at the request of security institutions is another document published by this outlet. These incidents have been reflected in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Committee.\n\n\n== Cyber Attack ==\nOn February 5, 2010 (16 Bahman 1388), Amirkabir NewsLetter, along with Advar News, the media of Generations of the office of Strengthening of Unity (also known as the Organization of Islamic Iran's Graduates), came under attack by government hackers known as \"Iran Cyber Army\" and went offline. In their message, the hackers wrote: \"If the Leader (the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader) commands, we will rise; if he wishes, we will give our heads for him.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmirkabir University of Technology\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Esther Porter (née Polinska; c. 1900–1935) was a Ukrainian Jewish anarchist who was active in Argentina during the early 20th century. She participated in the events known as the Patagonia Rebelde and later became the mother of intellectuals Ismael and David Viñas.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nEsther Polinska (Yiddish: אסתר פאלינסקא) came from a Ukrainian Jewish family that emigrated to Argentina in the mid-1900s, fleeing their home city of Odesa, which was a target of the pogroms in the Russian Empire. The family landed in Argentina after being denied entry to the United States because one member was ill. Because she emigrated as a child, aged about four or five, the youngest of four sisters, she retained little of her native language or culture as an adult. Upon entering Argentina, her father changed his surname from Polinsky to Portes.\n\n\n=== Life in Santa Cruz ===\nIn 1919, Porter moved to the city of Río Gallegos. She went there together with her partner, the radical lawyer Ismael Pedro Viñas, who was about 15 years her senior, who had been sent there as a judge-advocate. Viñas was an influential figure in the local justice system, as he was the first to openly confront the estancieros, who held the de facto power in the territory of Santa Cruz. He was also a major player during the series of strikes and social conflicts that took place in Santa Cruz between 1920 and 1921, commonly known as the Patagonia Rebelde, which was repressed by the Argentine army, which killed roughly 1,500 rural workers.\nIn this sparsely populated town, located at the southern tip of Patagonia, the fact that the territory's legal judge was living with Esther Porter, without being married, was considered unheard of. This, together with some of Esther Porter's liberal attitudes, such as going to the cinema alone, meant that she was seen as a woman of advanced ideas. In turn, these attitudes and her anarchist ideas led to enmity between her partner and the interim governor Edelmiro Correa Falcón, who at the same time was secretary of the Río Gallegos Rural Society. This, together with the fact that Viñas soon began to investigate acts of corruption involving some livestock companies and members of the territory's rural societies, led to a notorious institutional conflict between the governor's office and the court.\nAccording to Esther Porter's eldest son, it was she who made Viñas aware of the injustices suffered by the Patagonian workers and the exploitation to which they were subjected by the big landowners:\n\nAccording to what my father told us much later, when my mother went to visit the prisoners in the police station, one of them [Pedro Mogilnitzky] stood up, greeted her in Russian, kissed her hand in the most ceremonious European manner, and told her the 'truth'. That they were not criminals, but workers who had organised themselves to fight against exploitation, and that was why they had been arrested.\n\n\n=== Final years in Monte ===\nPorter and Viñas finally married in 1925, when she was pregnant with their first child, Ismael Viñas, who would grow up to become a writer and Marxist intellectual. The following year they moved to Buenos Aires. In 1927 their second son, David Viñas, who would later become a renowned writer and literary critic, was born. Soon after, they moved to Monte, where they suffered political persecution from right-wing groups during the Infamous Decade. There, her children would recall that she defended her house from attacks by armed gangs, and confronted conservative supporters who harassed her husband, a known radical militant. In 1935 she died unexpectedly at the age of 35. \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nEsther Porter's untimely death left a deep mark on her two sons, Ismael and David, which was reflected in their literary works and various interviews they gave throughout their lives. In the book Los dueños de la tierra by David Viñas, one of the main and most important female characters, Yuda Singer, is clearly inspired by her. This was confirmed on several occasions by David Viñas, who recognised several similarities between the two. In turn, this same character represents the ideological alter ego of Judge Vera, who is the main figure in the work, who has been interpreted as representing either his father or David's own alter ego. This author idealised the figure of his mother and her rebellious character, which is reflected not only in the female character in this book, but also in other literary works written by him.\nIn Osvaldo Bayer's work, La Patagonia Rebelde, Porter appears only as the partner of the judge Ismael Viñas, depicted as not having play any significant role herself. However, according to her children, she played important an role in the events. When she died, several Santa Cruz workers who survived the army massacres sent her widower a bronze memorial plaque for her grave, but he refused to put it in place, for fear that it would be vandalised.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Television in Catalonia, in reference to the autonomous community of Spain, is made up of television channels broadcast exclusively in Catalonia, whether for the whole of Catalonia or for certain regions and counties, as well as state-wide Spanish channels, which may or may not have disconnections from the general feed with exclusive programmes for Catalonia.\nProgramming on Catalan channels is mainly broadcast in one of the languages of Catalonia (Catalan and Aranese Occitan), although Castilian content is not subtitled or translated. Additionally, most Catalan channels and disconnected versions of Spain-wide channels are also watchable from Andorra and most of Northern Catalonia.\nThe first television broadcasts in Catalonia took place around the beginning of 1959, when the newly born Spanish television station Televisión Española (TVE) arrived in the capital city of Barcelona. Catalan public broadcaster Televisió de Catalunya (TVC) began broadcasting in 1983.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== During the dictatorship ===\nTelevision broadcasts in Catalonia began in the late 1950s, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Although Spanish broadcaster Televisión Española had officially started operating on 28 October 1956, broadcasts were only visible on a small number of television sets, all of which were located in Madrid. It was not until 15 February 1959 that it arrived in Catalonia, when the city of Barcelona began broadcasts with a football match between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Local headquarters, Miramar studios, were established in the city on 14 July of the same year.\nDue to the strict repression and ban on Spanish languages other than Castilian under Franco's regime, no television programmes were initially broadcast in Catalan or Occitan. However, in 1964, the first ever official Catalan language broadcasts took place, when RTVE Catalunya began broadcasting some theatre programmes, such as Teatre Català. Most notably, the cultural programme Mare Nostrum was broadcast once a month from 1967 to 1973. 1975 saw the birth of Miramar, a territorial disconnection news programme for Catalonia, nowadays known as L'informatiu.\n\n\n=== Transition ===\nAfter the passing of Franco and the transition to democracy, Catalan language broadcasts began becoming more common and accepted. Catalan-language programmes began to be broadcast on TVE on a daily basis, with territorial broadcasts being mostly in Catalan from 1977 onwards.\nOn 7 June 1980, Televisió de Cardedeu, the first channel to broadcast entirely in Catalan, as well as the first local channel in Catalonia and in the whole of Spain, began broadcasting to the town of Cardedeu, in Vallès Oriental county. It is a community channel that continues operating today. In 1983, RTVE's Catalan studios were moved from Barcelona to Sant Cugat del Vallès (Vallès Occidental), where they remain today.\n\n\n=== Birth of Televisió de Catalunya ===\n\nOn 29 September 1982, the Executive Council of Catalonia approved the draft law for the creation of a radio entity and television for Catalonia. On 23 April 1983, coinciding with St Jordi's Day, the Catalan government launched an experimental broadcast, which would become the first from Televisió de Catalunya (TVC), exclusively in the Eixample district of Barcelona.\nBroadcasts from the nascent Catalan flagship channel TV3 began on a test basis on 10 September 1983, a day before the National Day of Catalonia, this time reaching 70% of Catalonia. Regular broadcasts started on 16 January 1984, point in which Catalan news programme Telenotícies was also first aired. By late 1984, TV3 reached all of Catalonia, including part of Northern Catalonia. In April 1986, Televisió de Catalunya opened its headquarters in Sant Joan Despí (Baix Llobregat).\nOn 10 September 1988, TVC started test broadcasts for its second channel, El 33, beginning regular broadcasts just a year later. That same year, TVE started its first broadcasts in Occitan, with programme Era Lucana.\nOn 24 April 1989, TV3 began broadcasting Telenotícies comarques, offering local news for each of the Catalan regions. Special broadcasts for the Aran Valley (in Occitan) began every Friday in 1990.\n\n\n=== The 1990s ===\nIn 1991, TVE channel La 2 began broadcasting The Simpsons with a Catalan-dubbed audio option for Catalonia. That same year, commercial broadcaster Antena 3 launched regional broadcasts for Catalonia, the only ones not in Castilian in the whole of Spain.\nOn 24 July 1992, TVC and TVE signed an agreement to launch Canal Olímpic, a channel entirely dedicated to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, replacing the frequency of El 33. It was restored to the original channel on 9 August.\nOn 3 November 1994, betevé, Barcelona's local television station, began broadcasting regular programmes, which can now be seen throughout the whole throughout Barcelonès county.\nOn 10 November 1994, TV3 began broadcasting Poble Nou, its first soap opera.\nCommercial broadcaster Antena 3 obtained airing rights for The Simpsons in December 1994, exceptionally including the Catalan audio channel for Catalonia, but only up to the fourth season, the last that TVE had dubbed, being exclusively in Castilian from that point onwards.\nOn 27 July 1999, Barça TV began broadcasting. That same year, TVC began experimenting with broadcasting all its channels on digital terrestrial television.\n\n\n=== The 2000s ===\n\nThe city of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelonès) began broadcasts of its own local television channel, Televisió de l'Hospitalet, on 22 December 2000.\nOn 23 April 2001, TVC began broadcasting channel K3, dedicated to children and young people, on the same frequency as El 33. On that same day, Citytv began broadcasting in Barcelona as the first fully commercial Catalan television station, later renaming to 8tv and broadcasting for all of Catalonia as well as Andorra.\nThe regional channel Lleida Televisió, which has coverage in Ponent, Alt Pirineu and Aran, began broadcasting on 10 May 2001.\nOn 11 September 2003, 3/24 was launched as TVC's all-news channel.\nOn 2 July 2004, Antena 3 discontinued its regional broadcasts in Catalonia. On 4 October of that same year, local broadcasting network Localia TV entered Catalonia with Catalan programming.\nOn 5 September 2005, the Balearic channel IB3 became visible in the south and east of Catalonia through analogue signals.\nOn 21 November 2005, TVC launched the Canal 300 series and films channel, available exclusively via digital terrestrial television.\nTV3 began broadcasting an experimental HD channel on 23 April 2007.\nIn December 2007, IB3 discontinued its analogue broadcasts in Catalonia, replaced with IB Sat, a special version of the channel for Catalonia, which would take until 2009 to show up on digital terrestrial television.\nOn 9 February 2008, commercial musical channel RAC 105 TV began broadcasting.\nIn 2009, the Spanish all-news channel 24 Horas began broadcasting programmes exclusively for Catalonia. That same year, on 12 August, Valencian channel Nou began broadcasts in Catalonia, while TVC channels did the same in Valencia. In addition, on 18 October, K3 was replaced by Canal Super3, a new children's channel based on the Club Super3 programme.\n\n\n=== The 2010s ===\nThe decade began with the analogue switch-off, which took place throughout the whole of Spain on 30 March 2010.\nAt the end of March 2010, Nou was replaced by Nou Internacional in Catalonia, as the Valencian government failed to consistently broadcast TVC channels. In July, Nou Internacional stopped broadcasting there entirely, going online-only due to financial problems.\nOn 19 September 2010, TVC launched Canal 3XL, replacing Canal 300, a youth programming channel with Catalan dubs of many series and anime shows.\nOn 5 November 2010, the first channel in Occitan, Aran TV, began broadcasting sporadically through the Lleida TV frequency, thanks to an agreement between the General Council of Aran and the Catalan government.\nTVC began tests for a sports channel on 22 October 2010, called Esport3, fully rolling out on 5 February 2011.\nOn 30 September 2012, due to financial problems, 3XL ceased broadcasting, with El 33 broadcasting at night on the same frequency as Super3. On 1 November of that same year, IB3 stopped broadcasting in Catalonia.\nOn 30 April 2013, the Valencian and Catalan governments made an agreement to broadcast both TVV and TVC channels in both territories, although this was never realised due to the complete shutdown of Radiotelevisió Valenciana on 29 November 2013.\nEl Punt Avui TV, a channel from Girona-based newspaper El Punt Avui, began broadcasting on 23 April 2014.\nOn 15 April 2016, IB3 began broadcasting in Catalonia again, under a special IB3 Global channel.\nThe Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals and the Ens Públic de Radiotelevisió de les Illes Balears make an agreement to launch a pan-Catalan online channel, known as Bon Dia TV, on 27 November 2018. The Corporació Valenciana de Mitjans de Comunicació has also formed part of it since 19 November 2021.\nEl Punt Avui TV ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2019.\n\n\n=== The 2020s ===\nBOM Cine, a commercial films channel available in select Spanish communities, began broadcasting in Catalonia on 16 March 2020 through an agreement with 8tv owner Group Godó. Although only 3% of its airtime was broadcast in Catalan, in breach of Catalan broadcasting law, which requires a minimum of 50% in Catalan, no sanctions were taken against the broadcaster.\nOn 20 April 2020, commercial channel Teve.cat began broadcasting, watchable from the regions of Barcelona and Tarragona, as well as part of Girona and Central Catalonia.\nRAC 105 TV closed on 1 June 2020, being replaced by Manresa-based commercial channel Fibracat TV, mainly targeting content relating to new technologies and feminism.\n\nDue to extremely low audience figures on commercial channel 8tv, broadcaster Group Godó announced the sale of Emissions Digitals de Catalunya on 5 March 2021, which, in addition to 8tv, included the frequencies of Barça TV, Fibracat TV and BOM Cine, to OC 2022, for ten million euros. It was authorised by the Catalan government in July 2021.\nOn 23 November 2021, BOM Cine was replaced by Verdi Classics, a commercial channel broadcasting films, mainly in Catalan.\nTeve.cat was shut down on 12 September 2022, date in which Canal 4 began broadcasting in the Barcelona region.\nIn October 2022, the sale of EDC was realised, forming part of OC 2022. The rebrand of 8tv was heralded as an attempt to compete with TVC, and one of the slogans used by 8tv when it was re-launched was \"TV3, are you ready?\". It was also announced that the broadcaster would begin to focus on full Catalan-language programming in order to achieve this competition, although on the very day of the rebrand the broadcaster continued to broadcast a large amount of content in Castilian.\nFibracat TV was closed on 31 December 2022, after the company stopped paying rent for the frequency in June 2021.\nOn 2 June 2023, the company managing 8tv, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya, declared a debt moratorium, and began a 3-month period to renegotiate the debt with its creditors. Due to financial issues, Barça TV was closed that month, on 30 June 2023.\n\nAt a press conference in May 2023, the Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals announced the merger of Televisió de Catalunya and Catalunya Ràdio under a new brand, 3Cat, scheduled for 2028.\nOn 10 October 2023, Super3 was replaced by SX3, a rebrand of TVC's youth programming channel, displaying an S3 logo for children audiences and an X3 one for young viewers and more mature programmes. Although it still shared its frequency with El 33 on terrestrial television, it had now been made available online throughout the day. It was started in response to the very poor audiences of the former Super3.\nAfter having obtained several overtime concessions from the Catalan government, the company behind 8tv filed for bankruptcy and the channel was due to cease broadcasting at midnight on 15 October 2023. However, broadcasts continued both through terrestrial television and the internet until a few minutes after midnight on 17 October 2023, when both 8tv and Verdi Classics stopped broadcasting, marking the end of the whole of Catalan commercial television. As of May 2024, Catalonia's commercial multiplex (MAUT-CAT-2) continues to be empty.\nOn 30 October 2023, the CCMA launched the new 3Cat digital platform, replacing the old 3alacarta video-on-demand service and the TV3 mobile application. On the same day, channels 3/24, SX3, Esport3 and El 33 began broadcasting in HD, exclusively online, via the new platform, with terrestrial broadcasts continuing in SD quality.\nOn 8 January 2024, three months after the closure of 8tv, the station began operating again through the Internet, still self-proclaimed as \"the commercial television of Catalonia\", but now broadcasting entirely in Castilian. Some of its programmes are also broadcast through terrestrial television through Canal 4, which broadcasts in the Barcelona region, Mallorca and the community of Madrid.\nAlthough the Spanish government had set the date to switch-off all SD television signals on 14 February 2024, Televisió de Catalunya announced on 12 January 2024 that they would carry out the switch-off a month earlier, on 16 January 2024. The SD version of TV3, the only TVC channel broadcasting through terrestrial in HD, was to be switched off, while all the other channels, which only aired in SD, would automatically switch to HD. Additionally, the Balearic channel IB3 Global, which was broadcast in Catalonia with a poor SD quality due to the limited space left in the multiplex, also switched to HD and a better-looking bitrate on that day. Following the switch-off of SD signals, the need for many viewers with older TV sets to buy an adapter or a newer TV caused queues and shortages throughout Catalonia.\n\n\n== Regulations ==\nAudiovisual content in Catalonia, which includes television broadcasts, is regulated by the Catalan Audiovisual Council, in accordance with article 82 of Catalonia's Statute of Autonomy and created in May 2000. The council conducts studies and monitors compliance with television and radio regulations (usage of Catalan, advertising, sexist content, impacts on children, violence/discrimination, etc.) and is, most significantly, the body responsible for approving and allocating frequencies to television channels.\nThe 1998 law of Catalan linguistic policy mandates that television channels with licences granted by the Catalan government must broadcast over 50% of their own programmes in Catalan.\n\n\n== Local programming ==\n\n\n=== Disconnected broadcasts ===\nSince 24 April 1989, TV3's Telenotícies comarques programme offered a brief regional news segment via disconnections from the main feed for the four demarcations (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona) every working day, including a special Aranese-language broadcast for Aran on Fridays. In June 2017, these disconnected broadcasts were discontinued (with the exception of Aran).\n\n\n=== County and regional broadcasters ===\n\nThere are several local television channels in Catalonia, which can be watched exclusively in certain counties, regions or territories. Not all of these broadcasters are public, as some are commercial and some such as Ràdio Televisió Cardedeu are community-operated.\nIn order to provide much of the content to these broadcasters, the Xarxa de Comunicació Local (Local Communication Network) was set up in 2013 to share the content produced between member local broadcasters.\n\n\n== List of terrestrial television stations ==\n\nThis is a list of the channels broadcasting through digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Catalonia, whether limited disconnections of unique content not available to the rest of Spain, or completely exclusive channels. For a list of state-wide channels that broadcast the same content in Catalonia as in the rest of Spain, see the List of television stations in Spain.\n\n\n=== Active stations throughout all of Catalonia ===\n\n\n==== Catalan channels ====\n\n\n==== Spanish channels with local disconnections ====\n\n\n=== Active regional/local stations ===\n\n\n==== Barcelona region ====\n\n\n==== Alt Pirineu region ====\n\n\n==== Central Catalonia region ====\n\n\n==== Girona region ====\n\n\n==== Ponent region ====\n\n\n==== Penedès region ====\n\n\n==== Tarragona region ====\n\n\n==== Terres de l'Ebre region ====\n\n\n==== Aran Valley ====\n\n\n=== Defunct stations that broadcast throughout Catalonia ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Television in Catalonia at Wikimedia Commons",

The campaign ended in a fiasco for the Spanish troops.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1508, the Spanish general, Pedro Navarro, captured the islet of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera while combating barbary corsairs. Gomera possessed a strategic location and its capture posed a threat to the Badis Berbers. It was fortified place and a shipyard for Barbary and Ottoman corsairs. In December 22, 1522, the Wattasid Moroccans recovered the islet and put the entire garrison to sword, including their governor, Juan de Villalobos. The Spanish saw a fleet and thought it was their own, opening their gate to the fleet and discovering it was a Moroccan fleet.\nIn 1525, the Marquis of Mondejar, Luis Hurtado de Mendoza, obtained permission from Charles V to recover the islet, to which he agreed. Luis came with 70 ships and 1,500 men. The plan was to capture the islet at night; however, the Spanish arrived before night fell. The Moroccans were warned of the upcoming expedition and prepared themselves. As the Spanish troops were landing, the Moroccans attacked them with vigor, putting them on route. The Moroccans also used their artillery to damage their ships. Luis, who was on his ship near the coast, saw the massacre and could do nothing to help the landing forces.\nMany Spanish knights were killed, including Juan Hutado de Mendoza, Garica de Guzman, Gonzalo de Medrano, and other knights.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMagdalena de Pazzis Pi Corrales (2019), Tercios del mar, History of the first Spanish Marine Infantry (In Spanish).[2]\nEnrique García Hernan (2006), War and society in the Hispanic monarchy, politics, strategy and culture in Modern Europe, 1500-1700 (In Spanish), Vol I .[3]\nJuan Antonio Vilar Sánchez (2000), 1526, boda y luna de miel del emperador Carlos V: la visita imperial a Andalucía y al reino de Granada.[4]",

This phase involves the construction of essential infrastructure, including four roundabouts, a pedestrian crossing, an underpass, and retaining walls. The project, with an estimated cost of €26,126,000 + VAT, commenced construction on 19 September 2020, originally slated for completion by 13 March 2023.\n\n\n=== Second phase ===\nThe anticipated second phase of the Limassol-Saitta motorway project has faced postponements, with its commencement now projected for 2025 instead of the initially planned 2024 start. Budgetary allocations for the year 2024 indicate a mere €50,000 earmarked for studies, reflecting a delay in crucial preparatory steps such as awaiting plans from the Land Registry and pending environmental assessments. Exacerbating the situation, unresolved issues with expropriations and environmental considerations, notably within NATURA-designated areas, have surfaced, necessitating additional studies and approvals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Limassol-Saïtta motorway project consists of multiple phases, with Phase A commencing construction on 19 September 2020. Originally slated for completion by 13 March 2023, Phase A has faced extensions due to unforeseen challenges, with the latest extension pushing the completion date to mid-2024. Meanwhile, Phase B, scheduled for initiation in 2025, has also been impacted by delays.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoads and motorways in Cyprus\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Darrell Tibell (born 20 February 2002) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a forward for Sandefjord in Eliteserien.\nHe was born in Umeå and is of Cameroonian descent. Joining IFK Norrköping as a youth player, he was a prolific goalscorer in the national U20 league and was drafted into Norrköping's first team early in the 2022 season. At the same time, he was loaned out to Norrköping's cooperation team IF Sylvia. Spending the season mostly in Sylvia, he also made his Allsvenskan debut in April 2022 against Djurgården. Ahead of the 2023 season, he was on trial with Västerås SK and Icelandic club ÍA, but was loaned out to Superettan team Skövde AIK.\nAfter Skövde struggled during parts of the 2023 Superettan, the form of both the team and Tibell picked up in the late phase of the season. Tibell scored two goals in the playout against Falkenberg, helping Skövde save their Superettan berth. He nonetheless left Norrköping in favour of a move to Norwegian club Sandefjord. He made his Eliteserien debut on 1 April 2024 against Rosenborg.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chronotropic incompetence (CI) is the inability of heart rate to increase as expected in response to exercise. In healthy people, cardiac output during exercise increases via a rise in both heart rate and stroke volume. When the heart rate does not rise sufficiently, this can lead to exercise intolerance. CI can be detected using a cardiopulmonary exercise test. People with CI have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and early death.\nChronotropic incompetence occurs in various diseases. Roughtly half of people with heart failure experience it, compared to less than 9% of age-matched healthy controls. When it occurs alongside alongside issues with stroke volume, it can leading to a strong decrease in functional ability. It is associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (part of the fight-or-flight response) leading to higher levels of norepinephrine. CI in heart failure can further be related to the use of β-blockers, a high resting heart rate or the downregulation of β-adrenergic receptors.\nCI is also observed in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Similarly to CI in heart failure, it is possibly linked to the autonomic nervous system shift towards the sympathetic nervous system. People with type-2 diabetes often experience CI too, as do some people with long COVID. People with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) also experience a blunted heart rate response to exercise. The CI in ME/CFS is most evident on the second day of a repeated exercise test, which induces post-exertional malaise.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Emilio Silva Barrera (born November 9, 1965, in Elizondo, Navarre) is a Spanish sociologist, journalist, and activist for the recovery of Historical Memory. He is one of the founders and president of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), a collective that has been searching for the mass graves of victims of repression in the Francoist zone during the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco dictatorship.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThough he initially aspired to pursue poetry, Silva graduated in Sociology and Political Science from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) and has dedicated most of his professional life to journalism. Within his journalistic career, he was the content director of the television program Caiga quien caiga during Manel Fuentes' tenure.\nIn the summer of 1999, he left his job to write a novel related to his family history during the repression unleashed by the Francoist troops and paramilitaries after the July 18, 1936 coup. In March 2000, following an interview with the communist militant and former political prisoner Arsenio Marco, he located in Priaranza del Bierzo (León) the site where his grandfather, Emilio Silva Faba, had been buried in a mass grave along with twelve other men. They were all left-wing and republican militants murdered by Falangists on October 16, 1936, during the Spanish Civil War.\nIn September 2000, he published an article in La Crónica de León titled: \"My grandfather was also a disappeared person.\" In it, he lamented how Spanish society celebrated the so-called Pinochet case while doing nothing to search for the thousands of men and women who had disappeared due to Francoist repression, murdered by Falangist paramilitaries who hid their bodies to multiply the pain of their families and to declare their belief that those who created Spain's first democratic period during the Second Spanish Republic should not have existed.\nFollowing the exhumation of the grave where the now-known \"thirteen of Priaranza\" were found, he founded, along with Palma Granados, Jorge López, and Santiago Macías, the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), of which he is president. The association has been exclusively dedicated to searching for Republican disappeared persons, those who were not rescued by either Francoism or democracy. It has also been responsible for exhuming numerous mass graves and providing extensive documentation to people who have not known anything about their loved ones for decades.\nFrom 2007 to 2014, Silva worked as a political trust position for the mayor's office of the Madrid municipality of Rivas-Vaciamadrid. Additionally, he has worked as a journalist in various media outlets and is part of the team of the radio program La Cafetera de radiocable, directed by journalist Fernando Berlín, where Silva covers news related to Historical Memory. Due to his involvement in the recovery of Spain's Historical Memory and the exhumation processes of mass graves, Silva has appeared in several documentaries narrating these processes, such as Los caminos de la memoria (José Luis Peñafuerte, Spain, 2009), premiered at the Valladolid International Film Festival as part of the official section, Lesa Humanidad (Héctor Faver, Spain, 2017) and Bones of Contention (Bones of Contention, Andrea Weiss, United States, 2017).\n\n\n== Works ==\n2004 – La memoria de los olvidados: un debate sobre el silencio de la represión franquista.

        "content": "Stian Kristiansen (born 6 January 1999) is a Norwegian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Sandefjord in Eliteserien.\nHestnes hails from Vevelstad and played youth football for Vevelstad, Tjalg and Brønnøysund. He also made his senior debut for Brønnøysund before moving to Mosjøen to attend upper secondary school. With this came a transfer to Mosjøen IL, where he experienced relegation from the 2017 3. divisjon. He moved to Bodø to take higher education, which also entailed a transfer to IK Junkeren, though the 2020 season of the lower leagues was cancelled. In 2022 Kristiansen scored 10 league games as Junkeren won promotion to the 2023 2. divisjon. After the 2022 season he went on trial with Sogndal, but stayed in Junkeren.\nPlaying his first seson on the third tier in 2023, several transfer bids were rejected in the first phases of the 2023 summer transfer window. In August, a bid from Åsane was accepted, and then another from Ranheim, with Kristiansen being close to finalizing a transfer to the second tier. However, Junkeren's neighboring club, and dominant Norwegian club in the 2020s, Bodø/Glimt, suddenly entered the process. The move to Bodø/Glimt was confirmed on 16 August, and was regarded as surprising. His unassuming career before suddenly making the leap from the third tier to a club in European competition was described as \"the beauty of football\".\nWhile Kristiansen only reached as far as being benched for two of Bodø/Glimt's league games and the two 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League qualifying phase and play-off games against Sepsi, the fellow first-tier team Sandefjord saw fit to procure Kristiansen ahead of the 2024 season. He made his Eliteserien debut on 1 April 2024 against Rosenborg. He made national headlines when scoring Sandefjord's 2–1 goal in the 3–1 victory over Bodø/Glimt's assumed title contenders, Molde. Eurosport described him as \"a very important piece\" for Sandefjord.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "MIAX Pearl Equities (MIAX), is an American stock exchange headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey. The exchange also has offices in Miami, Florida, where its parent company Miami International Holdings is based.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn March 2019, financial conglomerate and exchange operator Miami International Holdings (MIH), announced plans to launch a new US stock exchange, which would later become MIAX Pearl Equities. Prior to this, MIH had already set up three equity options exchanges in the US. According to then-Chairman and CEO Tom Gallagher, MIH hoped to complement its options offerings and later break into the listings business.\nOn August 18, 2020, the Securities Exchange Commission approved MIH's filing to register the stock exchange, paving the way for its launch.\nMIAX Pearl Equities was launched in September 2020, in the same month as the Long-Term Stock Exchange and Members Exchange. This brought the total number of US stock exchanges at the time to 16, with MIAX Pearl Equities being the latest entrant.\nInitially, the exchange raised $22 million by selling prepaid blocks of fees to a group of market makers that included Citadel Securities and UBS. The exchange also waived fees for market data and offered a rebate of 32 cents per 100 shares for market makers to display orders on the platform, a level which sits toward the higher end of what incumbent exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq offered, in hopes of gaining market share and trading volume.\nThe exchange began trading on September 29, 2020, initially offering only a single low-volume symbol, Netgear (NTGR), before gradually expanding to all US listed stocks.\nIn May 2022, MIAX's parent company Miami International Holdings announced that it had confidentially submitted paperwork with the regulators for a U.S. IPO.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Fees ===\nMIAX Pearl Equities is positioned as a lower cost alternative to its larger rivals such as NYSE and Nasdaq.\nThe exchange also incentivizes a group of nine high-speed market makers, using a system of rebates or special fees, to provide liquidity on its platform.\n\n\n=== Clearing ===\nAs of April 2024, clearing members of the exchange include major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, and also equity market makers such as Jane Street Capital and Hudson River Trading.\n\n\n=== National Market System ===\nThe exchange is a participant of several National Market System plans, including the Consolidated Tape Association, Unlisted Trading Privileges, Consolidated Audit Trail (CTA), and Limit Up-Limit Down (LULD).\n\n\n=== Market data ===\nThrough its affiliate Bermuda Stock Exchange, MIAX Pearl Equities publishes its market data to the Pyth Network, a decentralized service that provides real-time market data on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\n=== Matching engine ===\nThe exchange's trading system is situated in the Equinix NY4 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Products ==\nStocks\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMiami International Holdings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Goodenia parvisepta is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales. It is a glabrous perennial herb with erect flowering stems, lance-shaped leaves with toothed or lobed edges, and yellow flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia parvisepta is a glabrous, perennial herb with erect or ascending flowering stems up to 40 cm (16 in) long. Its leaves are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 80–150 mm (3.1–5.9 in) long and 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) wide with toothed or lobed edges. The flowers are borne on the flowering stem with bracteoles up to 10 mm (0.39 in) long and free from each other. The lower sepal is elliptic, 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) long, and the petals are yellow, 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) long and hairy only on the outside, with wings about 1 mm (0.039 in) wide, almost to the base of the lower sepal. Flowering mainly occurs from September to January and the fruit is a more or less spherical capsule containing seeds about 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1967 by Roger Charles Carolin who gave it the name Velleia parvisepta in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd and others transferred it to the genus Goodenia as G. parvisepta in Australian Systematic Botany.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nGoodenia parvisepta grows in damp situations in the Goonoo State Forest in New South Wales.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juna Furniture (transl. Old Furniture) is a 2024 Indian Marathi-language drama film written and directed by Mahesh Manjrekar, who is featured in the leading role. Other cast included Medha Manjrekar, Bhushan Pradhan, Anusha Dandekar, Sameer Dharmadhikari, Sachin Khedekar, and Upendra Limaye in pivotal roles. It is produced by Yatin Jadhav under the banner of Skylink Entertainment.\nThe film was theatrically released on 26 April 2024 and grossed over ₹6 crore (US$750,000) at the box office, become the fourth highest grossing Marathi film of the year. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, praised for its portrayal of human emotions, resilience, and societal concerns, particularly regarding the neglect of senior citizens and criticised for illogical elements and a slight drag in the plot post-interval.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOnce upon a time, there lived Govind Pathak, a senior citizen. His son, Abhay, a prominent IAS officer, tied the knot with Avni, a woman from a wealthy family. Abhay's career soared as he was appointed as the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. To secure his father's future, Abhay invested Govind's retirement savings and managed his financial transactions. However, Govind often found himself in need, having to repeatedly ask Abhay for money. One fateful day, when Govind urgently needed Abhay's help due to his mother's deteriorating health, Abhay was preoccupied with a birthday celebration. Despite Govind's attempts to reach out, the message went unanswered until it was too late. Tired of His sons ignorance, Abhay decides to file a case against his son demanding the sum of money he had spent for his sons future till now. The movie then shows how Abhay fights the case gaining support for other senior citizens but also angrying some other people.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMahesh Manjrekar as Govind Shridhar Pathak\nMedha Manjrekar as Suhasini Pathak\nBhushan Pradhan as Abhay Govind Pathak\nAnusha Dandekar as Avni Abhay Pathak\nSameer Dharmadhikari as Sameer Joshi, Abhay's father-in-law\nSachin Khedekar as Sessions Judge\nShivaji Satam as Magistrate\nSharad Ponkshe as Advocate\nUpendra Limaye as Prakash Dagdu Bhope alias Pakya bhai\nGirish Oak as Adovocate Bapat\nRamdas Sawant as Ramdas Sawant\nMakarand Anaspure as Chief Minister\nOnkar Bhojane as Bandya\nShrirang Deshmukh as Deshmukh\nPrem Dharmadhikari as Vinya\nShridhar Limaye as Dr. Joshi\nVijay Nikam as Adovocate Dinkar Pandit\nAlka Parab as Manda Gawde\nDhananjay Mandrekar as Dr. Veerendra Sharma\nRajesh Bhosale as Vada Pav stall owner\n\n\n== Production ==\nMahesh Manjrekar conceived the idea for \"Juna Furniture – Try Stopping This Old Man\" nearly 12 years ago, drawing from a deeply personal space following the loss of his mother. This contemplation led him to explore the plight of abandoned senior citizens in India, a topic close to his heart. Originally planned as a Hindi film, Manjrekar encountered delays in production due to casting and other logistical challenges. However, producer Yatin Jadhav's enthusiasm for the project prompted Manjrekar to pivot to Marathi cinema, allowing for a quicker turnaround. With no actor available on short notice, Manjrekar took on the central role himself, marking his first lead role in his own directorial venture.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe teaser of the film was launched at Aaji Ajoba Udhyan at Shivaji Park, Mumbai, where Salim Khan was attended the event. The film was theatrically released on 26 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nKalpeshraj Kubal of The Times of India rated 3.5 stars out of 5 stars and wrote \"Juna Furniture is a story of human emotions, resilience and a societal concern that is prominently seen today.\" Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in called it \"A simplistic crusade against the neglect of senior citizens.\" Priyanka Kulkarni of Sakal awarded 3.5 rating out of 5, the reviewer is praised the film's music and cinematography, acknowledging its excellence. However, she also found aspects of the film are illogical. Sanjay Ghaware of Lokmat rated 3.5 stars out of 5 stars, noted the mix of poignant and humorous dialogues and praise the gripping first half, though acknowledging a slight drag in the plot post-interval, which eventually recovers.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film collected ₹40 lakh (US$50,000) on its opening day and grossed over ₹1.2 crore (US$150,000) in three days. The film has earned ₹4 crore (US$500,000) in the first week. The film stands at ₹5.75 crore (US$720,000) in five days. On the next day film crossed ₹6 crore (US$750,000) mark.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n\n== Remake ==\nManjrekar had announced that the Hindi remake of the film will hit the screens on May 10, 2024, in an interview with ABP Majha.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJuna Furniture at IMDb",

        "content": "The 2024 Q School is a series of four snooker tournaments to be held at the start of the 2024–25 snooker season. An event for amateur players, it serves as a qualification event for a place on the professional World Snooker Tour for the following two seasons. The events will take place in May and June 2024 at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England and also at the BSAT Academy in Bangkok, Thailand with a total 12 players qualifying via the four tournaments. The two events held in England were organised by the World Snooker Tour, whilst those in Thailand were organised by the Billiard Sports Association of Thailand.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe 2024 Q School consists of four events, two held in the UK and two \"Asia-Oceania\" events held in Thailand. The Asia-Oceania events were only open to citizens of those continents. Any player was allowed to enter the UK events, but players could not enter both the Asia-Oceania and UK events. All matches will be the best of seven frames.\n\n\n== Event 1 ==\nThe first 2024 Q School event will be held from 21 to 26 May 2024 at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England.\n\n\n== Event 2 ==\nThe second 2024 Q School event will be held from 27 May to 1 June 2024 at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England.\n\n\n== Asia-Oceania event 1 ==\nThe first 2024 Asia-Oceania Q School event will be held from 22 to 27 May 2024 at the BSAT Academy in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n\n== Asia-Oceania event 2 ==\nThe second 2024 Asia-Oceania Q School event will be held from 28 May to 2 June 2024 at the BSAT Academy in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n\n== Q School Order of Merit ==\nA Q School Order of Merit will be produced for players who fail to gain a place on the main tour. The Order of Merit will be used to top up fields for the 2024–25 snooker season where an event fails to attract the required number of entries. The rankings in the Order of Merit will be based on the number of frames won in the two UK Q School events. Players who receive a bye into the second round will be awarded four points for round one. Where players were equal, those who win the most frames in the first event will be ranked higher. Other tie-breaker criteria will be used if players are still tied.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Oskar Brehm (12 December 1823 – 8 May 1850) was a German entomologist and naturalist. He was a half-brother of Alfred Brehm and the two were travelling and collecting in Africa when Oskar drowned in the Nile.\nOskar brehm was born in Renthendorf in 1823 to Christian Ludwig Brehm and his first wife Amalia Wächter who died in 1826. Alfred Brehm was born to Ludwig Brehm and his second wife Bertha Reiz who also raised Oskar.  Oskar became keenly interested in insects along with his father and went on hunting and bird study trips from an early age. He went to the village school and at 15 he apprenticed in the pharmacy in Münchenbernsdorf (Thuringia). He collected nearly 1500 European beetles along with Rector Lübben from Aschersleben. In 1846 he went to study architecture in Dresden and also studied pharmacy at Jena and went to Heinrich Wackenroder's (1798–1854) private pharmaceutical-chemical institute. He interrupted his studies to join a trip with Baron von Müller to Africa along with his brother. The travel began in September 1847 and the first part ended in December 1848 and Alfred stayed in Egypt. A second part was from February 1850 to October 1851. Oskar joined the second part and was a specialist on the plants and insects. He initially went to Trieste where he met Reinhard Vierthaler (1820–1852) and they travelled together to Alexandria. Oskar has been identified as being particularly interested in insects but a number of later records have been confounded and ascribed to Alfred. When Oskar sent a shipment of pills to his brother, Oskar asked for a beetle in return for each pill. When Oskar joined on the second part of the trip he collected extensively and many of the new species were described by Johann Heinrich Gottfried Apetz. He joined up with Alfred on November 24, 1849, via Smyrna. A nine-member party set off to Sudan in December 1849. When they reached Dongola on May 8, 1850, Alfred and his brother went for a swim in the Nile and Oskar suddenly disappeared. His body was not found until half an hour later and attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was buried in a simple brick monument in the Coptic cemetery at Dongola.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n175. Geburtstag von Oskar Brehm (175th birthday of Oskar Brehm)",

In 1909 she was sold and renamed Thracia and in 1917 she was torpedoed and sunk by SM UC-69.\n\n\n== Building and registration ==\nThe Orono and her sister ship Oceano were built by the Sir Raylton Dixon & Co. at Middlesbrough, United Kingdom. Orono was launched and completed in 1898. Orono had a registered length of 310 ft (94 m) and her beam was 43.9 ft (13.4 m). Her measured tonnage was 2,891 GRT. The ship's engines were rated at 258 NHP and gave her a speed of about 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). \n\n\n== Early years ==\nOrono's maiden voyage was in 1898 during the Second Boer War. She continued in service with the Plate Steamship Co, Ltd. until 1909 when she was sold to the Cunard Line, which renamed her Thracia. The ship continued to deliver cargo on Cunard lines Mediterranean route until 1914.\n\n\n== First World War and sinking ==\nWith the outbreak of First world war in 1914. Thracia was used to deliver cargo for the war effort. she was given a Vickers machine gun at her stern. The cargo ship sailed without incident until March 1917. While sailing in a convoy from Bilbao to Glasgow with a cargo of iron ore, the vessel was torpedoed by the German U-boat UC-69, on the night of 27 March 1917. Thracia sank very fast taking the lives of 36 men, only two men survived. One was picked up by a French fishing boat and the other by the Norwegian steamer Nordborg.\n\n\n== Wreckage ==\nThe wreck of Thracia lays off the coast of France. The wreck was located after the war by a salvage company for scrap metal using explosives, destroying much of ship. The Thracia wreck was mostly forgotten until being rediscovered by a French diver. The wreck is in bad shape. It is badly broken up and is mainly just a confusing tangle of beams and plates. One of the most distinctive features of the wreck is the two large boilers which lie side by side. Her Vickers machine gun is on display at the Musee de Quiberon.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a Professor and the former Chair of the Department of Human Development and Family Sciences at the University of Delaware (UD).\nTrask's research focuses on globalization, women's employment, and family dynamics in Western and non-Western countries. She has authored and edited multiple books including Women, Work, and Globalization: Challenges and Opportunities, Globalization and Families: Accelerated Systemic Social Change, and Cultural Diversity and Families. She has been elected as a fellow to NCFR, and is the recipient of the UD Excellence in Teaching Award, the Jan Trost Award from NCFR and the Groves Feldman Award from the Groves Conference on Marriage and Families.\nTrask has held a guest editorship of the Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal.\n\n\n== Education ==\nTrask completed her B.A. in Political Science with a concentration in International Relations from Yale University and a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBeginning in 1995, Trask served as an adjunct Lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania before transitioning to a position as an assistant professor from 1997 to 2002, holding a joint appointment in the Department of Individual and Family Studies and the Center for Community Research and Service at the University of Delaware. She then assumed the role of associate professor in 2002, maintaining her joint appointment at the UD. In 2007, she became a Professor with a joint appointment within the same department and institute, later serving as Professor and Associate Chair/Graduate Coordinator until 2015. From 2015 to 2023, she held the position of Professor and Chair of the Department of Human Development and Family Sciences at the University of Delaware.\nTrask has been engaged with the United Nations, contributing to various expert group meetings, panels and conferences focused on family dynamics, migration, urbanization, and human rights-based policies.\nShe has given two keynote addresses on the International Day of Families in 2018 and 2022. She has also spoken at United Nations expert group meetings and other United Nations international conferences, and served as a keynote speaker at the 9th Biennial International Conference of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre in Galway, Ireland. In addition to her involvement with the UN, she has presented at the 2014 White House Summit on Working Families and the Joseph Biden Institute. She was elected as a National Council on Family Relations (NCFR) Fellow in 2015 and later served as a Program Chair for NCFR in 2018.\n\n\n== Research ==\nTrask's research has focused on the effects of economic shifts on family dynamics and gender roles, the evolving notions of race, ethnicity, and gender in a globalized world, and the formulation of policies to support and empower low-income families. In her studies, she analyzed societal mega-trends such as demographic change, international migration, technological advancements, and the impact of COVID-19 on families, emphasizing the importance of informed policies to support families in achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while also highlighting families' crucial role in fostering inclusive societies by promoting social rights, legal frameworks, participation, and access to housing and public green spaces, aligning with SDGs 16 and 11. Additionally, her research has highlighted various factors impacting families, emphasizing the need to prioritize globalization-families interplay for effective policy implementation.\n\n\n=== Women and globalization ===\nTrask's first edited book, a volume in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Women's Issues Worldwide provided a coverage of women's efforts for gender equality globally, examining the intersection of local conditions with international influences such as globalization and UN initiatives. Feminist Collections commented that this book, \"is a must for all college libraries, and highly recommended for public and high school collections.\"\nAnother book authored by Trask, Women, Work, and Globalization, looked into the increasing presence of women in the global labor force, focusing on how it affects their roles in society and within families. Through comparative analysis, it explored the challenges and opportunities women face, from managing work-life balance to the broader social, political, and economic implications of their participation in the workforce. Carol J. Auster remarked, \"Trask's book offers insights about the impact of globalization on societies at a variety of levels. Trask avoids the unevenness apparent in some edited volumes. The author not only keeps the promises described above that she makes early in the book, but she also provides students in a variety of social science disciplines more than just a book about women, work, and globalization.\"\n\n\n=== Family dynamics ===\nThrough her edited work, Personal Relationships, she focused on the interplay between healthy relationship dynamics and overall life satisfaction.  She explored the influence of cultural diversity on families, shifting the focus from categorization by race or ethnicity to discussing diverse family issues thematically in her edited book, Cultural Diversity and Families: Expanding Perspectives. She also authored, Globalization and Families: Accelerated Systemic Social Change, which discussed the impact of globalization on families, influencing their social, economic, and identity dynamics through work, communication, and cultural exchange. This book has also been translated into Chinese. Rahul Sharma reviewed the book and wrote, \"Trask observed that while in the past, locale mattered, today social relationships are maintained over great distances with ease. Global communications such as the internet, e-mail, and satellite linkups are facilitating these relationships over space and time.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2017 – UD Excellence in Teaching Award, University of Delaware\n2019 – Jan Trost Award, NCFR\n2022 – Groves Feldman Award, Groves Conference on Marriage and Families\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nThe Greenwood Encyclopedia of Women's Issues Worldwide (2003) ISBN 978-0313327872\nCultural Diversity and Families: Expanding Perspectives (2007) ISBN 978-1412915427\nGlobalization and Families: Accelerated Systemic Social Change (2009) ISBN 978-0387882840\nPersonal Relationships (2010) ISBN 978-1609279219\nWomen, Work, and Globalization (2013) ISBN 978-0415883382\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nTrask, B.

The illustrations were created by Japanese illustrator Uedatsubasa, and the film was edited and produced by Tsumiki.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nThis song placed at number 13 on the Heartseekers Songs chart released by Billboard Japan on December 15, 2021, and peaked at number 10 on the Heatseekers Songs chart in the fifth week.\nIn the YouTube Top User Generated Songs chart released by Billboard Japan on January 12, 2022, it entered the top 20 and ranked third, later rose to second place in the 24th week, and eventually surpassed \"Kamippoi na\" and won the first place in the 31st week.\nThe song ranked second on the Top User Generated Songs chart for the first half of 2022. And won the second place on Billboard Japan Niconico Vocaloid Songs Top 20 chart on December 21, 2022.\n\n\n== Wagakki Band version ==\n\nWagakki Band covered \"Phony\" and released their music video on YouTube on 1 June 2022.\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Phony\" on Niconico",

        "content": "The siege of Carmona was a military engagement between the Umayyads and the Abbasids, who besieged the city of Carmona, where Abd al-Rahman garrisoned himself there, in an attempt to install Abbasid rule in Andalusia. The Umayyads decisively defeated the Abbasids and prevented their invasion.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 763, the local governor of Beja, Al-Ala ibn Mughith al-Judhami, rebelled against the Umayyads in Andalusia. The Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, made one final attempt to bring Andalusia under Abbasid control. Al-Ala aligned himself with the Abbasids. He received money, arms, and moral support from the Caliph. Al-Ala even raised the Abbasid flag and appointed himself governor of Andalusia. The Umayyad prince, Abd al-Rahman, left Cordoba and went to Carmona, a strong fortress high on a hill.\nAl-Ala besieged the fortress for two months. Eventually Abd al-Rahman saw the Abbasids becoming impatient with the siege and ordered his troops to burn the scabbards of their swords, encouraging his men, numbering 700, to follow with him in a sortie that took the Abbasids by surprise. Al-Ala was killed alongside many Abbasid officers. The officers were beheaded, including Al-Ala. Their heads were embalmed and sent to Kairouan as a message of defiance to the Caliph.\nThe debacle at Carmona ended any Abbasid interference in Andalusian affairs; both sides soon became preoccupied with other issues. Al-Mansur reportedly said:\n\nWe all belong to God. We sent this miserable man to his death. Praise be to God who has put the sea between me and this devil.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHugh Kennedy (2014), Muslim Spain and Portugal, A Political History of Al-Andalus.[1]\nTimothy M.

        "content": "Terezinha de Jesus Almeida Silva Rêgo (São Luís, February 5, 1933 – May 3, 2024) was a professor, researcher and important educator as well as a doctor at the Federal University of Maranhão.\nShe worked in teaching botany, in addition to carrying out extensive research on medicinal plants that were subject to extinction. She worked on the study of the Amazonian flora existing in Maranhão, which allowed her to work on the manipulation of medicines used in treatments using plants. This work served as inspiration for the launch of the Maranhão project Farmácia Viva.\n\n\n== First years ==\nBorn in São Luís, on February 5, 1933, she was the daughter of Joaquim Pedro da Silva and Francisca da Conceição Almeida Silva.\nShe was a student of Basic Education and Gymnasium at Colégio Rosa Castro, where she began to develop a taste for science and plants. Secondary studies were completed at Liceu Maranhense.\nHer family owned a farm in the municipality of Cajapió. Her grandfather was an Army colonel and Secretary of State, and was very interested in treatment through plants, always asking people what they took to cure an illness. Her grandfather was a great inspiration for her career, as well as her supporter, having given her her first scales to weigh materials collected in research to prepare medicines.\nIn 1955, she entered the undergraduate course in Pharmacy and Biochemistry (an isolated federal institution that would become part of the Federal University of Maranhão, created in 1966), having graduated in 1957. During college, she was a Botany teacher at the main schools. in Maranhão (Rosa Castro, Liceu Maranhense, Santa Teresa).\nDuring her undergraduate studies, Terezinha went to peripheral neighborhoods to survey the most common diseases and brought plants that were already known and studied for a certain type of treatment, considering the difficulty of people not having access to a pharmacy, as the medicines were very expensive. The active ingredient was extracted from the selection of plants for the manufacture of natural medicines. There was also a concern about people who came from the countryside and were used to treating illnesses with herbs and could not find the same plants in the capital, having promoted the installation of medicinal gardens.\nTerezinha recognized the greater effectiveness of allopathic medicines, which gave faster responses, but considered that their side effects were stronger than herbal medicines, which could be used to treat some diseases.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nIn 1959, she went to the University of São Paulo to pursue a doctorate in General Botany, returning in 1965 to São Luís.\nThe researcher achieved the title of associate professor in General Botany after three years at the University of São Paulo (USP), as a Capes scholarship holder, having completed her thesis \"Contribution to the morphological and anatomical recognition of Tagetes minuta L\" in 1977, which was defended at the Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA), becoming a professor in the university's Department of Pharmacy.\nThroughout her academic career, she published several books, reports and articles, such as: \"50 medicinal teas from the flora of Maranhão\" and \"Phytogeography of medicinal plants in Maranhão\", \"Survey of the flora of the Baixada Maranhão\" (1977); \"Analysis of the fundamental characteristics of the Pre-Amazon\" (1980); \"Medicinal plants of the Maranhão flora\" in UFMA research notebooks, 1985 and in \"Acta Amazônica\" (1977).\nIn January 1984, she created the \"Ático SEABRA\" herbarium at UFMA, where 10,800 species that characterize the flora of the state of Maranhão were catalogued, with support from CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development). tinctures, ointments and syrups.\nShe also specialized in phytotherapy at the University of Havana, in Cuba, in addition to having trained in the Emergency Toxicological Chemistry Course, 1970; Biology Course, 1970; Update Course on Medication Analysis, at the \"I Maranhão Congress of Pharmacists\", 1974; Botanical Systematics Course, 1976; Plant Anatomy Course, 1982, in Brasília.\nShe retired from the university in 1991, but continued working as an advisor between 1999 and 2021, continuing with research, conferences, classes, and activities at the \"Ático Seabra\" Herbarium.\n\n\n=== Recognition and legacy ===\nAmong her main works, three herbal medicines are Essência de Cabacinha, Urucum Syrup and Assa-Peixe Tincture. Cabacinha Essence is the result of 20 years of research, being used to treat sinusitis, rhinitis and adenoid problems through the infusion of cabacinha fruit in alcohol. Terezinha Rego also did research on chanana, a yellow flower that has an energetic substance that can be used to improve the immune system, with its component being used in the treatment of cancer at the Aldenora Bello Hospital, in São Luís.\nFrom 2001 onwards, Chinese universities began to exchange with the Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA), with annatto syrup being used to combat Asian pneumonia (SARS) and was especially useful during the outbreak of the disease in 2003. Much of Brazil's annatto production is exported to China, turning into syrup. Teresinha was honored by the Brazil-China Chamber of Industry and Commerce for sending three medicines to combat the disease, in addition to annatto syrup, used to treat pneumonia, and assa-peixe tincture, a herb originating from Baixada Maranhense, to alleviate the effects of diabetes; and gourd essence, for cases of nasal congestion.\nIn the 1990s, she was elected, in Cuba, representative of Ethnobotany in Latin America, from 1990 to 1994.\nIn 1983, her work was awarded an award at the Ethnobotany Congress in Córdoba, Spain, for her research with the Canela indigenous people, after spending several days in the village in the late 1970s, selecting and classifying 75 plants that were used for medicinal purposes. The work was published by the Brazilian Botanical Society.\nIn 2019, a special session was held in honor of the Federal Senate of Brazil to the professor for the health of the needy population and the training of new pharmacists.\nThe professor was a founding member of the Maranhão Academy of Sciences, coordinated the Maranhão Biotechnology Center (MAR-BIO) and phytotherapy projects in needy communities in Maranhão through the state Farmácia Viva program, which has 32 gardens implemented in state agencies, institutions teaching facilities, schools, quilombola communities and terreiros.\n\n\n== Death ==\nTeresinha died at the age of 91 in São Luís from respiratory failure after contracting pneumonia. She was admitted in serious condition to a private hospital in the capital a week ago after falling and hitting her head.\nThe teacher was married for more than 56 years to the dental surgeon from Piauí Artur Nunes do Rêgo, with whom she had two daughters, Tânia Maria Silva Rêgo, teacher and doctoral candidate in music, and Telma Maria Silva Rêgo, professor of philosophy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fang Yi'ai (Chinese: 房遺愛; ?— 6 March 653), was a Tang dynasty politician who served as the governor of Fangzhou. He was the second son of Fang Xuanling, a prominent statesman who served as Chancellor under Emperor Taizong of Tang. Fang Yiai was married to Princess Gaoyang, the 17th daughter of Emperor Taizong.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nFang Yi'ai was a native of Qizhou, but his exact birth date is unknown, but it is believed to be sometime in the early 7th century. He was born into a prominent family, as his father, Fang Xuanling, was a highly respected official in the Tang court. Fang Yi'ai did not receive a well-rounded education but was skilled in martial arts.\nIn 648 CE, Fang Yi'ai was married to Princess Gaoyang, the 17th daughter of Emperor Taizong. The marriage between Fang Yi'ai and Princess Gaoyang was arranged by Emperor Taizong after the execution of Princess Gaoyang's lover, a monk named Bianji. Gaoyang became bitter after Bianji's death, and her betrothal and wedding went ahead despite her protests. However, instead of animosity and resentment, Gaoyang and Fang Yi'ai grew closer and bonded over their mutual hatred for the imperial court.\nAfter his marriage, Fang Yi'ai was appointed to a number of government positions. He served as a right-guard general and later as the governor of Fangzhou. In 653 CE, Fang Yi'ai was involved in a failed rebellion against Emperor Gaozong of Tang. The rebellion was orchestrated by his wife, Princess Gaoyang. However, the rebellion was swiftly suppressed, leading to Fang Yi'ai's death. Subsequently, Princess Gaoyang committed suicide upon the orders of her brother, Emperor Gaozong.\nXu Jingzong, a Tang dynasty historian, later commented on Fang Yi'ai's rebellion in the Old Book of Tang, stating, \"Fang Yi'ai is still a child at the breast, how could he conspire with women to rebel?\".\nCai Dongfan, a late Qing dynasty historian, commented on Fang Yi'ai's actions, stating, \"When discussing the princess's wrongdoing, Fang Yi'ai is the main subject. If Fang Yi'ai had been diligent in preventing idleness, how could the princess dare to indulge in wanton behavior? Even if a wife commits adultery, the husband bears the blame according to the laws.\" The authors traced the origin of the disaster to Wu Meiniang and Fang Yi'ai; subtly ridiculing them. This critique was not intended to excuse the prince and the princess but to highlight the corruption of women and the lack of moral principles in men, both of which are seen as causes of national downfall and family ruin.\nFang Yi'ai had a great-grandson named Fang Jiang, who had two sons, Fang Hui and Fang Xun. Fang Hui had a son named Fang Ning, whose courtesy name was Xuanjian, and who served as the governor of Yingzhou. Fang Xun had a son named Fang Kerang, who had two sons, Fang Ye and Fang Fu. Fang Ye's courtesy name was Zhengfeng. Fang Yiai's grandson, Fang Nu, later became an imperial censor.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Pan Yueming in the 2001 Chinese TV series Love Legend of the Tang Dynasty\nPortrayed by Ye Peng in the 2006 Chinese TV series The Rise of the Tang Empire\nPortrayed by Bai Yunfei in the 2006 Chinese TV series Wu Zi Bei Ge\nPortrayed by Lou Yajiang in the 2014 Chinese TV series Heroes of Sui and Tang Dynasties\nPortrayed by Zhu Xiaohui in the 2014 Chinese TV series The Empress of China\n\n\n== References ==",

From April to July 2015 he was a Visiting Researcher at the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo in Japan. Following this, he became a Senior Researcher at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione di Bologna, from November 2018, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen in Germany, from May to June 2019.\nCosta became the managing director of the INGV Branch of Bologna from September 2019 to August 2022. Since September 2022, he has been serving as a Senior Researcher at the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia of Sezione di Bologna, Italy.\n\n\n== Research ==\nCosta's primary research interests revolve around the fluid mechanics of volcanic processes, particularly emphasizing magma ascent dynamics, magma properties, models for geophysical flows, atmospheric gas dispersion, atmospheric transport of volcanic ash, and natural hazard and risk assessment.\n\n\n=== Volcanology ===\nCosta introduced a semiempirical model that accurately predicted the effective relative viscosity of crystal-bearing magmas across diverse suspended solid configurations, showcasing its utility in comprehending magma behavior through parameter adjustments within fitting ranges. He developed magma ascent models that enlightened the controls of conduit geometry and wallrock elasticity on lava dome and explosive eruptions.\nIn collaboration with Costanza Bonadonna, Costa introduced an empirical approach for estimating tephra-deposit volumes, utilizing the integration of the Weibull function. He is also one of the lead authors of the FALL3D model. With Yujiro Suzuki, he coordinated the international study on Eruption Column Model Inter-comparison of the IAVCEI Commission on Tephra Hazard Modelling.\n\n\n=== Geophysical fluid dynamics ===\nCosta's research on fluid dynamics presented a new equation relating permeability and porosity, derived from classical methods and fractal geometry; the Kozeny‐Carman approach, with only two parameters.\nAmong Costa's research works is the exploration of thermal effects on the dynamics temperature-dependent fluids as well as of rheological properties of high-solid suspensions, with a focus on silicate melts, and the proposal of semiempirical models describing the effective relative viscosity of crystal-bearing magmas and partially melted rocks as a function of crystal fraction, crystal shape, and strain rate backed up by extensive experimentation.\n\n\n=== Natural hazards ===\nIn 2016 Costa was lead author of the report for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Volcanic Hazards Assessment for Nuclear Installations: Methods and Examples in Site Evaluation. More recently in 2022, he served as the contributing author of reports addressing methodologies and case studies for coastal nuclear safety, emphasizing defense in depth post-2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2011 Fukushima Daiichi incident, and the use of validated numerical models for tsunami hazard evaluation.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2013 – Wager Medalist, International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI)\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nCosta, A.

        "content": "The 22nd Utah Territorial Legislature met in 1876. The regular election for the House of Representatives was held August 3, 1874. The regular election for the Territorial Council was held August 2, 1875. \n\n\n== Session ==\nThe legislative session convened on January 10, 1876, at the City Hall in Salt Lake City, and ended on February 18, 1876.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nThe House seat from Tooele was caught up in a general dispute over the 1874 election in that county. The Liberal Party, a rough coalition of disaffected Mormons allying with non-Mormon residents of the territory, achieved there its first notable victory over the People's Party supported by the Mormon establishment; the Liberal ticket prevailed in the official results, and Erastus S. Foote was chosen as the territorial House delegate over George Atkin. However, each side attacked the validity of the other's votes, keeping the outcome in doubt as further wrangling ensued.\n\nThe Liberals argued that many votes for the People's ticket were illegal, having been cast by alien nationals. With a sizable portion of the Mormon population having immigrated from England, including some of its leaders (Atkin among them), this allegation might disqualify many voters and also render candidates ineligible to serve. Most claimed to be naturalized as Americans, but often had their papers issued by the county probate courts, whose jurisdiction to confer citizenship was further called into question.\nFor its part, the People's Party faction alleged that many voters were ineligible due to not meeting the requirement of being taxpayers and resident in Utah for six months. This particularly singled out the relatively transient mining settlements in Tooele County, largely non-Mormon districts that overwhelmingly provided the base of Liberal support. It was claimed that up to 80% of their votes should be disqualified. In response, the Liberals wished to assert that many miners were in fact residents, while the failure to enroll them as taxpayers was due to the negligence of territorial officials. They also questioned the treatment of women voters under the circumstances. The territorial legislature had granted women the right to vote in 1870, but they were not required to be on the tax lists, and most women voters were Mormon, in contrast to the predominantly male mining communities.\nThe federal appointees in the territory, Governor George L. Woods and Chief Justice James B. McKean of the Supreme Court, sided with the Liberals, so Foote was issued the certificate of election and presented himself at the opening of the legislative session. But the House of Representatives, claiming the power to ascertain the qualifications of its own members, opted to consider Atkin's suit to contest the result, and referred the matter to its Committee on Elections. After conducting an investigation, the committee in its report rejected a significant number of ballots for each side that were deemed illegal, but considerably more for Foote, with the result that the election was awarded to Atkin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hezbollah in Latin America is a splinter organization of the Shia Islamist Lebanon-based group Hezbollah which operates in throughout South America.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was established in the 1980s in the tri-border region of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina which was considered a safe haven for the group's operations of smuggling, recruitment, and plotting of attacks. They expanded into Venezuela with some degree of sponsorship from the Venezuelan state. They also receive funding from the Iranian state in order to conduct operations against U.S. and Jewish interests in South America with many of the members of the group being Arab Muslims who either immigrated or were born in South America. The establishment was also seen as a way for Iran to get more leverage against the U.S., with this formation being taken as the setting up of a South American proxy terrorist network.\nIn 1994 the group bombed the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association building. Though a Palestinian Jihadist group took responsibility as a front for Hezbollah.\n\n\n=== Terrorism after October 7th ===\nAfter the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and throughout the Israel–Hamas war there have been numerous attempts by Hezbollah in Latin American to commit terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli civilians in South America.\nIn November 2023 two men who had links to Hezbollah in Latin America and the main group of Hezbollah were arrested by Brazilian police. One of the men was arrested in the international airport in São Paulo after coming from Lebanon into Brazil. The plan that the men had was to attack Jewish communities in Brazil, but the plan was foiled with assistance from the Mossad intelligence agency. In addition to these arrests, the Brazilian police executed 11 search warrants in relation to the recruitment of extremists in Brazil.\n\n\n== Revenue ==\nMost of the group's international revenue comes from Iran, with some funds being laundered from Venezuela. Some of the revenue that is gained by Hezbollah in Latin America goes towards the main group in Lebanon to make up for loss of funds in Lebanon. A lot of the funds they receive in South America come from the smuggling of illegal items through the tri-border of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay which is used to fund terroristic activities. Many of these items include drugs, stolen goods, weaponry, and pirated content. The group also funnels cocaine through Colombia and Venezuela. Selling illegal goods make up around 60-70% of all of the group's revenue.\n\n\n=== Sanctions ===\nThe United States have issued many sanctions against the group, especially during the Trump Administration, but they have been more limited in South American compared to its Lebanese sector. Efforts were made by Trump to increase sanction against Hezbollah in Latin America more during his presidency.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It runs in a southerly direction from the southern end of Turtle Lake to the North Saskatchewan River across from Delmas. The town of Turtleford is the only sizeable community along the river's course.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTurtleford River begins at the community of Turtle Lake South Bay at the southern end of Turtle Lake in the Rural Municipality of Mervin No. 499. At the source, Turtle Lake South Bay is on one side of the river and the 10-acre Turtle River Campground is on the other. From the lake, the river flows south-west through the Thunderchild 115B Indian reserve where it is met by Brightsand Creek (which originates at Brightsand Lake) to the town of Turtleford. At Turtleford, Turtlelake River turns south towards the Rural Municipality of Turtle River No. 469 and the North Saskatchewan River. It meets the North Saskatchewan across from Delmas, near the Michaud Islands.\nHighways 26, 303, 674, and 795 cross Turtlelake River.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Saskatchewan\nHudson Bay drainage basin\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Burhanpur Dargah Case  was filed to resolve the dispute arisen due to right to the use of certain waqf property belonging to Dawoodi Bohra, situated in Burhanpur, India.\nThe 46th Dai-ul-Mutlaq, Syedha Mohammed Badruddin, and his predecessors Dais were appointed by valid ‘nass’ but on his death a controversy arose between members of the Dawoodi Bohras community as to whether or not \"Badruddin appointed a successor by ‘Nas-e-Jali’ (a sort of declaration). Dispute between the parties to this particular property case arose on the point that a true Dai-ul-Mutlaq can only be a custodian of the property.\nThe case was filed in 1925, by Mahomed bhai and Taib ali. They died during course of time and new appellant were applied to attend the case. After years together when the hearing before their Lordships began in Privy Council, the appellant were Hasanali Jaffarji and Tahir bhai. They stated in evidence that they do not regard the defendant as truly appointed Dai-ul-Mutlaq.\nAfter due deliberations, the main question left to be decided by counsel in the case was whether respondent is a Dai-ul-Mutlaq. The council finally came to the conclusion  that ‘there is ample evidence upon which the fact of \"Nas\" can be inferred’ and, therefore, agreed that respondent 51st Dai Syedna Taher Saifuddin ‘must be regarded as Dai-ul-Mutlaq’.\nThere was a similar case known as Chandabhoy Galla Case in which position of Dai-ul-mutlaq got further ascertained. In year 1591 AD also, in the court of Mughal emperor Jalaluddin Akbar,  Sulayman ibn Hasan challenged 27th Dai Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah's accession. After much deliberation, Akbar eventually issued a royal farman (lit. 'decree') in favor of Dai Qutub Shah, instead. In another instance in 2014, succession of Mufaddal Saifuddin was contested by an opposing faction led by Khuzaima Qutbuddin, 51st Dai Syedna Taher Saifuddin's son, who moved  the Bombay High Court to protract the case despite lack of mainstream recognition. On 23 April 2024, the Bombay high court dismissed the suit challenging Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin's position as the 53rd Dai-al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra Community. The court dismissed Taher Fakhruddin(son of Khuzaima Qutbuddin)'s claim and upheld Syedna Mufaddal as Dai-ul-Mutlaq..\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yunxian Man (Chinese: 郧县人; pinyin: Yúnxiàn rén) is a set of three hominid skull fossils discovered at the Xuetangliangzi site (学堂梁子遗址; Xuétángliángzǐ Yízhǐ) in Yunyang district, Hubei, China. Two skulls were discovered in 1989 and 1990, followed by a third in 2022. The first two were described as \"crushed and distorted\" but \"relatively complete\", and compared to Homo erectus or early Homo sapiens. In contrast, the third skull was discovered \"in good condition\".\nThe Xuetangliangzi paleontological site is at the mouth of the Quyuan River (曲远河; Qūyuǎn Hé), where it flows into the Han River, so it has also been called the Quyuan River site.\n\n\n== Skulls ==\nFragments of two heavily deformed and broken skulls were discovered in Xuetangliangzi in 1989 and 1990. These finds were called Yunxian Man, after the name of the local district at the time. These were given collection numbers EV 9001 and EV 9002 and are sometimes referred to as Yunxian 1 and Yunxian 2. The fossils were excavated by the Institute for Cultural Objects and Archeology of Hubei Province, the Yunyang Regional Museum (now the Shiyan City Musem), and the Yun District Museum. \nIn autumn 2022 the discovery of a third skull 35 meters from the discovery site of the two original skulls was discovered and designated Yunxian 3.\nIn June 2001, the State Council designated the Xuetangliangzi site as a major cultural heritage site under national-level protection, as part of the fifth batch of additions to the list.\n\n\n== Scholarly analysis ==\nThe first two skulls bear similarities to Dali Man, but are significantly older. Adjacent animal fossils allowed their age to be narrowed down to 600,000 to 400,000 years before present. Some sources have described the specimens as Homo erectus, including a 3D virtual imaging analysis in 2010. However, scholars are still divided, with some suggesting that it could be a more modern species or a mix with Homo sapiens.  \nThe paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer has suggested that Yunxian Man could be Homo heidelbergensis, which may thus have originated in Asia, though Chinese scholars dispute this classification. In a 2016 article in Scientific American, Stringer called for better access to Chinese fossil specimens such as Yunxian Man and Dali Man, such as by replicas or CT scans. In 2012, Stringer also wrote about speculation that Yunxian Man could be a Denisovan ancestor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Black Horses, or Lower Cambridge Valley is a 1942 oil painting by the American outsider painter Grandma Moses, produced at age 82 and signed \"Moses\".\nIt was in the collection of Otto Kallir in 1975.\nThe painting shows the artist's impression of three horses, with the brown one on the left being ridden by two children coming up the hillside, and two black ones on the right that are cantering towards each other. The hillside overlooks Cambridge Valley with the Hoosic River in the middle and the mountain range beyond. \nA recurring subject by the artist, this version made an impression on the gallerist Otto Kallir when he first saw it at Ala Story's show of Grandma Moses paintings at her American-British Art Center in December 1942. He considered it an important improvement upon the two circa 1940 versions he had shown at his gallery in What a Farm Wife Painted. This painting convinced him the artist had grown in two years and prompted him to undertake a copyright agreement with Grandma Moses at his Galerie St. Etienne. He included all three versions in his 1946 Grandma Moses American Primitive catalogue. Another 1942 version painted in the summer before Black Horses is held in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nImage of the 1940 version in Otto Kallir's 1946 catalogue of 40 paintings with comments by Grandma Moses herself, called Grandma Moses American primitive\nOtto Kallir, Grandma Moses, Complete edition, New York, Harry N.

        "content": "The Beltway Bowl is the name given to a geographic rivalry between two NFL teams named the Washington Commanders and Baltimore Ravens. Both teams locations are in the same metropolitan area, however they compete in separate conferences. This rivalry represents the opposition that other Baltimore and D.C. teams have due to them being in the same area, like the Beltway Series of the MLB between the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles.\nThe first meeting of these two teams occurred in 1997, half a decade after the Redskins, now the Commanders, have moved from Massachusetts to Washington. The Baltimore Ravens have just come off of a tough loss versus the Miami Dolphins decided by only 11 points. Luckily for Baltimore, they hastily took a 14–7 lead at the half. Matt Stover and the Ravens sprung for a field goal in the middle third quarter of the game to extend the lead by 10. All Washington needed was a touchdown and field goal for the tie. Frerotte completed a pass to Brian Mitchell which gave the Redskins another 6 points on the board. The extra point kick sailed through the crossbars to cut the Ravens' lead down to 3. The score was noted 17–14. Matt Stover kicked a successful field goal for Baltimore to potentially put the game out of reach and make it 20–14. The Redskins settled for a late field goal, however, it was too late. Ravens evened out the teams' record to 4-4 and sealed a victory for the first time they played the Redskins. 20–17, the final score.\nSTUD",

        "content": "NGC 7222 is a large barred spiral galaxy with a ring structure, located in the constellation Aquarius. It is located 570 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered by German astronomer, Albert Marth on August 11, 1864. \nNGC 7222 has a luminosity class of II and it has a broad H I line which contains regions of ionized hydrogen.  NGC 7222 also has a surface brightness of 14.20 mag/am, which means it is considered a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSBs are diffuse galaxies that have surface brightness one magnitude lower compared to the ambient night sky.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been discovered in NGC 7222 so far: SN 2008dr.\nSN 2008dr\nSN 2008dr was discovered by a team of astronomers; J. Leja, D. Madison, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko from University of California, Berkely as part of Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). It had a magnitude of 16.8 and was located 1\".3 west and 8\".1 north of the nucleus. SN 2008dr was confirmed to be a Type Ia.\n\n\n== Companion galaxy ==\n\nNGC 7222 has a companion which is a spiral galaxy, PGC 68229, also known as CGCG 377-036. The galaxy is located west of NGC 7222 at close proximity and is 579 million light-years distant. It is possible both galaxies together make up a galactic pair.\n\n\n== References ==",

Seasons in which the Giants were league members (or an associate team), only games that counted in official league standings are included. Seasons in which they had no league membership and played an independent/barnstorming schedule include games against primarily major-league-caliber teams.\nContemporary coverage of games and won-loss standings was spotty and inconsistent.  On-going research continuously discovers unreported or misreported games, while some games are probably lost forever.  Therefore, Negro league seasonal finishes will likely remain incomplete and subjective.\n\n\n== Year by year ==\n\nKey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Honeygar Farm, or Honeygar, is a rewilding project of Somerset Wildlife Trust, near Westhay on the Somerset Levels of Somerset, England.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe Trust announced in August 2021 the purchase of the site, a former dairy farm near the River Brue, by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation; this would be repaid by the Trust through fundraising. The farm, together with adjacent parcels of land purchased, has an area of 81 hectares (200 acres).\nWesthay Moor and Catcott are nature reserves of the Trust in the Avalon Marshes, where the total area held by the Trust, including Honeygar, is 418 hectares (1,030 acres). This and nearby land held by other environmental organisations form the Avalon Marshes Partnership. Honeygar, lying between these sites, would create green corridors for wildlife in the area when managed for nature.\nTony Juniper, chairman of Natural England, said when the purchase was announced: \"Places like Honeygar represent fantastic opportunities to demonstrate how simply allowing nature to regenerate itself can be a powerful solution to the ecological and climate crises.\"\nSimon Clarke, head of nature recovery at Somerset Wildlife Trust, has said: \"Honeygar will be managed very differently to our nature reserves as it's our first wilded site. There's much to be done to reverse years of intensive management and to transform this nature-poor dairy farm into the wildlife-rich site we know it can be.\"\nA 50-year management plan has been set out. Initial interventions allow the restoration of natural processes such as grazing by herbivores, natural flooding, restoring peat by rewetting the peat soils, and natural afforestation. Describing the project, the Trust recognises that this is a journey: \".... we are learning as we go, so we will take an adaptive approach.... there will be changes to species on the site over time as nature returns....\" In managing the site, there will be no attempt to retain any particular species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Avalon Marshes",

The play, a comic farce, followed on the success of Cooper's first play, Colonial Experience.\nThe New Crime was inspired by claims from New South Wales politician Henry Parkes that there was a \"new crime\" in the colony, that of Fenianism (this followed the attempted assassination of Prince Alfred in Sydney in 1868 by Henry O'Farrell).\nThe Tamworth Examiner said \"the English papers have treated the colony to a little bit of their mind\" over the issue and since \"Sydney people feel that they have a good deal to answer for in connection with the matter, and feeling further the humiliation which has been brought upon them, are prepared to go to great lengths to relieve themselves in some way of the very severe rebuke which have been administered them. Mr, Cooper, in order to meet popular sentiment, has written a farce.\"\nThe play premiered at Victoria Theatre in Sydney on a double bill with The Rivals. Opening night also operated as a benefit for author Walter Cooper.\n\n\n== Critical reaction ==\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said the play was \"well written, and contains sufficient humour spiced with hits upon posed and passing events to provoke considerable amusement.\"\nThe Tamworth Examiner said the play \"seems to be immensely enjoyed by the citizens. We have not the least doubt but that if properly handled the farce will prove successful, for a more shameful trick was never played upon any community of Englishmen by a Cabinet Minister than that performed by Mr. Parkes with his \"New Crime\".\"\n\n\n== Cast of original production ==\nMr Davis as \"The Hon.

        "content": "Colonial Experience is a 1868 Australian stage play by Walter Cooper. It was Cooper's first play and the only one known to have survived in script form.\nAccording to academic Richard Fotheringham the term \"colonial experience\" was originally :a requirement for farm labour stipulated in advertisements; but by the 1860s it had become associated ironically with young well-bred Englishmen coming to Australasia and going bush to learn self-reliance and useful skills. Often they were the sons of the absentee owners of grazing properties, finding out at first hand about the nature of their family's investments.\"\nThe original production was \"a great success\". According to the Sydney Morning Herald this \"has shown the playgoing public that the talent necessary to the production of a good play is not confined to the mother country and a number of gentlemen, anxious to recognise Mr. Cooper's ability, have tendered him a benefit.\"\nSydney Punch said \"his comedy bears abundant evidence of his abihty to hit off the more stirring features of these characteristics with ease and 'dramatic wit and effect. The dialogue is effective throughout, and the interest never\nflags. There is nothing extravagant or improbable in the piece, and the modesty of nature is in no way violated.\"\nCooper appeared in a production.\nCooper followed the play later that year with another comedy The New Crime.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nMatthew Grudge, a rich usurer, has the will of his deceased brother which gives the money to a nephew, Grudge wants the money to go to a niece so she can marry his own son, so Grudge concels the will. However Grudge's clerk, Peter Shrivel, has a duplicate.\n\n\n== Revival ==\nThe play was published by Currency Press in 1979. Reviewing the published edition, Leonard Radic of The Age called it \"a lively piece.\" The play was presented by the New Theatre in Sydney in early 1981. The Sun Herald called it \"a beautiful old fashioned farce.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nColonial Experience at Ausstage",

As a literary work of art it is an exceedingly commendable production ; the characters are boldly and graphically sketched, and the dialogue lively\nand well pointed. Perhaps the principal defect of the latter is a trifling redundancy of colonial colloquialisms of the class most affected by bushmen and diggers, such as 'My colonial oath,'... and the drama wonld, technically speaking, playniuck ' closer for a judicious curtailment of the first and second acts.\nAs a piece of the sensational school, it is decidedly inferior to none.\" \nThe original production involved a court action.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSun and Shadow at Ausstage",

He was a Catholic priest and served  as a military chaplain during the Philippine Revolution in 1896. He was excommunicated in 1899 for rebelling against Spanish rule in the Philippines. Aglipay later co-founded the Philippine Independent Church in 1902 and became the church's first bishop.\nThe shrine houses Aglipay's mausoleum. It has a marker dated 1949 from the Philippines Historical Committee, now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. The commission declares the site as a national shrine.\n\n\n== References ==",

The WBC began in 1984 and served as a second-tier national league under the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL). It operated for six seasons until it was adopted by the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) in 1990.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1981, the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) was established. In 1983, it was determined that two national competitions were required for the development of women's basketball in Australia. A second-tier reserves league to sit under the WNBL was established, with the Women's Basketball Conference (WBC) debuting in 1984. The inaugural WBC champions were the Hobart Hustlers, which was followed by the Canberra Capitals winning in 1985, the South Adelaide Panthers in 1986, and the WAIS Rockets in 1987. The Dandenong Rangers won at least one WBC championship in 1989.\nIn 1990, the WBC was adopted by the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) to become the inaugural SEABL women's competition.\n\n\n== League championships ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hyatt Hotels Corporation, commonly known as Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, is an American multinational hospitality company headquartered in the Riverside Plaza area of Chicago that manages and franchises luxury and business hotels, resorts, and vacation properties. Hyatt Hotels & Resorts is one of the businesses managed by the Pritzker family. Hyatt has more than 1350 hotels and all-inclusive properties in 69 countries across six continents.\nThe Hyatt Corporation came into being upon purchase of the Hyatt House, at Los Angeles International Airport, on September 27, 1957. In 1969, Hyatt began expanding internationally. Hyatt has grown by developing new properties and through acquisitions, with the biggest growth coming from the acquisition of AmeriSuites (later rebranded Hyatt Place) in 2004, Summerfield Suites (later rebranded Hyatt House) in 2005, and Two Roads Hospitality in 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and early years ===\nThe first Hyatt House was opened in 1954 by entrepreneurs Hyatt Robert von Dehn (1904–1973) and Jack Dyer Crouch (1915–1990) as a motel near Los Angeles International Airport. In 1957, the hotel was purchased by entrepreneur Jay Pritzker for US$2.2 million. His younger brother, Donald Pritzker, also took on an important role in the company. Considering the growing use of air travel for business, the Pritzker brothers realized that locating a high quality hotel near a major airport was a valuable business strategy. Within two years, they opened Hyatt House Hotels near San Francisco International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.\nThe company went public in 1962 as Hyatt Corporation. It had two divisions - Hyatt House Hotels and Hyatt Chalet Motels (renamed Hyatt Lodges in 1966).\nIn 1967, the company opened the Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta, Georgia (today named the Hyatt Regency Atlanta). The futuristic hotel was designed by Atlanta architect John Portman, who would go on to design many other hotels for the chain. It featured a massive indoor atrium, which soon became a distinctive feature of many Hyatt properties.\nIn 1968, Hyatt International was formed, to operate hotels outside the United States. It would soon become a separate company. In 1969, Hyatt opened its first international hotel, when it was awarded the management contract for the President Hotel in Hong Kong, which was renamed the Hong Kong Hyatt Hotel (later known as the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong).\nIn 1972, Hyatt formed Elsinore Corporation, a subsidiary to operate the Four Queens Hotel and Casino and the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa & Casino. Donald Pritzker died in 1972 and Jay Pritzker continued to run the company.\nHyatt became a private company in 1979, when the Pritzkers bought the outstanding shares. Elsinore was spun off as a public company. The company opened the Playboy Hotel and Casino as a joint venture with Playboy Enterprises.\nAlongside the Hyatt Regency brand, the company introduced the Grand Hyatt brand in 1980, with the opening of the Grand Hyatt New York. That same year, the boutique Park Hyatt brand was also introduced.\nThe Pritzkers took Hyatt International private as well, in 1982. However, Hyatt and Hyatt International remained two separate companies until June 2004, when substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by the Pritzker family business interests, including Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity called Global Hyatt Corp. On June 30, 2009, Global Hyatt Corporation changed its name to Hyatt Hotels Corporation.\n\n\n=== Development since the 2000s ===\nIn December 2004, Hyatt Hotels Corporation acquired AmeriSuites, an upscale chain of all-suite business class hotels from affiliates of the Blackstone Group, a New York-based private equity investment firm. Blackstone had inherited AmeriSuites from its 2004 acquisition of Prime Hospitality. The AmeriSuites chain was rebranded and called Hyatt Place, a competitor to the limited-service products Marriott International's Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Worldwide's Hilton Garden Inn.\nIn December 2005, Hyatt acquired limited service company Summerfield Suites from the Blackstone Group. Blackstone had inherited Summerfield Suites from its purchase of Wyndham International. In January 2012, Hyatt Summerfield Suites were rebranded as Hyatt House in 2012 to compete in the \"upscale extended stay market\" against Residence Inn, Homewood Suites, and Staybridge Suites.\nHyatt launched its first lifestyle brand, Andaz, in April 2007. Hindi for the word 'style', Andaz is positioned as a luxury brand, with the first hotel being a rebrand of the Great Eastern Hotel in London, followed by hotels in San Diego, West Hollywood, Shanghai and New York City.\nIn August 2009, it was reported that Hyatt Hotels Corporation filed plans to raise up to $1.15 billion in an initial share sale. That November Hyatt completed an initial public offering and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol H. According to the filing Mark S. Hoplamazian was to serve as CEO and Thomas Pritzker as Executive Chairman. The public offering was a result of the acrimonious breakup of the Pritzker family empire. Accused of looting family trusts, Thomas and cousins Penny and Nicholas took control of the family businesses when they and other family members were sued by cousin Liesel Pritzker, claiming fraud and seeking damages of over US$6 billion.\nOn September 1, 2011, Hyatt acquired Hotel Sierra, which had 18 properties in 10 states. Along with Hyatt Summerfield Suites hotels, several of these properties were rebranded as Hyatt house in January 2012.\nIn November 2013, Hyatt introduced their first all-inclusive resort brands, Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara, with the first resorts being opened in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos and Rose Hall, Montego Bay, Jamaica.\nAs of 30 November 2015, Hyatt had over 627 hotels worldwide.\nOn October 28, 2015, Hyatt announced that they were in advanced talks to acquire Starwood Hotels in a cash and stock transaction. The transaction was not completed, and Starwood was acquired by Marriott International instead.\nIn 2018, Hyatt saw expansion with the acquisition of Two Roads Hospitality. This added the Joie de Vivre, Destination, Alila, and Thompson hotel brands to the Hyatt portfolio, a growth of 85 hotels in 23 markets.\nIn March 2021, Hyatt announced the official opening of Hyatt's 1,000th hotel worldwide, Alila Napa Valley in St. Helena, California.\nIn August 2021, Hyatt acquired Apple Leisure Group (ALG), a luxury resort-management services, travel and hospitality group, from affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and KSL Capital Partners for $2.7 billion in cash. ALG's hotel portfolio consists of over 33,000 rooms operating in 10 countries. The acquisition will extend Hyatt's brand footprint into 11 more European markets.\nIn 2024, the company is expanding its presence in India with seven hotels (1,115 rooms), including a historic hotel at The Noor-Us-Sabah palace in Bhopal after its restoration.\n\n\n== Brands ==\nHyatt-branded properties have traditionally catered to upscale or business customers; its properties were either full-service or boutique hotels. In 1980, Hyatt added the Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt brands to its portfolio. In 1995, Hyatt entered the vacation ownership market. Hyatt introduced the Hyatt Place brand, designed as a limited service offering for business travelers, in 2006. Hyatt House was Hyatt's first select-service property, catering primarily to travelers with long-term stays and at a more economical price point. Since then, Hyatt has added a wide range of other brands, especially in the lifestyle and resort segments.\nHyatt categorizes its brands under four categories: timeless collection (containing Hyatt's classic brands), boundless collection (lifestyle brands), independent collection (soft-branded independent properties) and inclusive collection (all-inclusive hotels). Two additional upscale lifestyle brands, tommie and Caption, have been announced and will be joining the portfolio once the first properties open.  Another brand, Hyatt Studios, was unveiled in April 2023 as Hyatt's first upper-midscale lodging segment in the Americas. Plans call for 100 Hyatt Studios hotels to be built starting in 2023 and the first location opening in 2024.\n\n\n=== Timeless Collection ===\n\nTimeless Collection houses Hyatt's signature hotel brands, including:\n\nPark Hyatt – top-tier luxury hotels offering fine dining and residential-style accommodation\nGrand Hyatt – large luxury hotels with expansive meeting facilities\nHyatt Regency – Hyatt's staple full-service brand offering city hotels, resorts and convention hotels\nHyatt Place – upscale select-service hotels with convenience features\nHyatt House – upscale select-service extended-stay hotels\nHyatt – a small assortment of Hyatt's small-scale full-service hotels\nUrCove – upper-midscale hotels targeted to Chinese travelers, co-developed with Home Inn.\nHyatt Vacation Club – timeshare and vacation rental resorts\nHyatt Studios – planned upper-midscale extended-stay hotels in the Americas, expected to debut in 2024\n\n\n=== Boundless Collection ===\nBoundless Collection houses Hyatt's lifestyle hotel brands, including:\n\nMiraval – luxury wellness resorts and spas\nAlila – luxury boutique hotels built around sustainable practices\nAndaz – destination-inspired luxury lifestyle hotels\nThompson Hotels – art-and-F&B-focused luxury lifestyle hotels\nDream Hotels – market-making design, nightlife and experiential hospitality\nHyatt Centric – compact full-service lifestyle hotels with location-reflective design\nCaption by Hyatt – select-service lifestyle hotels with lively public spaces\n\n\n=== Independent Collection ===\nIndependent Collection houses Hyatt's soft brands of independent hotels, including:\n\nThe Unbound Collection by Hyatt – a collection of independent story-telling upmarket hotels\nDestination by Hyatt – a collection of independent destination-defined luxury hotels, formerly Destination Hotels\nJdV by Hyatt – a collection of independent properties designed around their immediate neighborhoods, formerly Joie de Vivre Hotels\n\n\n=== Inclusive Collection ===\nFormerly AMR Collection and AMResorts of Apple Leisure Group, Inclusive Collection houses Hyatt's all-inclusive resort brands following its 2021 acquisition of ALG.

        "content": "NGC 3978 is a large intermediate spiral galaxy with a bar located in the constellation of Ursa Major. It is located 460 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered by William Herschel on March 19, 1790, but also observed by John Herschel on April 14, 1831. \nNGC 3978 has a luminosity class of II-III and it has a broad H II region which contains regions of ionized hydrogen. In addition, it is categorized as a LINER galaxy by SIMBAD, meaning its nucleus presents an emission spectrum which is characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms.\nAccording to Vaucouleurs and Corwin, NGC 3978 and NGC 3975 form a galaxy pair with each other.\n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nTwo supernovae were discovered in NGC 3978: SN 2003cq and SN 2008l.\nSN 2003cq\nSN 2003cq was discovered on March 30, 2003, by British astronomer Ron Arbour. It was located 32\".0 east and 2\".3 south of the nucleus with a magnitude of 17.1. This supernova was Type Ia.\nSN 2008I\nSN 2008I was discovered by astronomers P. Thrasher, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko as part of Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) on January 2, 2008. It was located 3\".7 west and 10.\"4 north of the nucleus with magnitude of 19.1. The supernova was Type II which possibly resulted from a collapse of a massive star. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David Smilde (born September 23, 1966) is an American sociologist and the Charles A and Leo M Favrot Professor at Tulane University, and Senior Fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. He is known for his contributions to the sociology of religion and scholarship and advocacy around Venezuela's political crisis.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSmilde graduated from Calvin College with a BA in philosophy and sociology in 1989 and received his MA in 1994 and PhD in 2000 from the University of Chicago. He completed his dissertation under Wendy Griswold. In 1995, he received a Fulbright-Hays dissertation fellowship and in 2006 was named a Fulbright Scholar to teach at the Universidad Central de Venezuela.\nHis 2007 book Reason to Believe: Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism won the 2008 Best Book Award in the Sociology of Religion section of the American Sociological Association. He has also won best article awards from the Sociology of Religion Section and the Association for the Sociology of Religion.\nFrom 2011 to 2018, he was editor-in-chief of the journal Qualitative Sociology. From 2015 to 2018, he was a part of the International Panel on Social Progress and co-authored the report's chapter on religion.\nIn 2012, he founded the blog Venezuelan Politics and Human Rights and curated it for the Washington Office on Latin America until 2020. From 2010 to 2012, he was chair of the Venezuelan Studies Section of the Latin American Studies Association. He is the program co-chair of the 2023 Latin American Studies Association Congress in Vancouver. He has been a residential fellow at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame, in 2001 and 2020.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\nSmilde became an important voice advocating for democracy in Venezuela, frequently commenting in the media and writing numerous opinion articles in The New York Times, Washington Post, and El País. In March 2017, he testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Venezuela, advocating against sanctions. His Venezuela advocacy has been criticized from the right and the left. In the Venezuelan blog Caracas Chronicles, Juan Cristobal Nagel criticized Smilde's analysis saying it “passing off government propaganda as cold analysis under the veneer of impartiality.\" In Jacobin, Daniel Finn argued that Smilde criticizes the possibility of military intervention but is simply advocating \"for intervention of a different kind.\"\n\n\n== Works ==\nSmilde, David, Veronica Zubillaga and Rebecca Hanson (eds.). 2022.

        "content": "Ruth Bashall (b. Bromsgrove England, 23 May 1952, d. London, England 11 November 2023) was an activist for lesbian and disability rights. She co-founded Stay Safe East, an organisation that supports disabled survivors of abuse, in 2010.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nBashall was born to Bill Parsons, an economist, and Joan, a translator and English teacher. The family moved to Paris in 1954, where Bashall learned French at Lycée Blaise Pascal. She returned to the UK in 1970 to study sociology at the London School of Economics, graduating with a BSc in 1975. She married Alan Bashall in 1971, they had a daughter the following year. They divorced in 1977.\n\n\n== Employment ==\nBashall worked as a bus conductor from 1977 to 1981, then at a community bookshop from 1981 to 1984. She was a transport researcher for the Campaign to Improve London’s Transport (CILT) from 1984 to 1990. She was a local council access worker for the London Borough of Waltham Forest from 1990 to 1996, and a policy officer from 1996 to 1999. In 1999 she became an independent disability equality trainer and consultant. From 2007 to 2017 she advised the Metropolitan Police and Greater London Authority on domestic and sexual violence and disability hate crime.\n\n\n== Activism ==\n\n\n=== Lesbian and women’s rights ===\nBashall came out as lesbian in the mid-1970s. At around the same time she helped to establish the Lesbian Mothers’ Group, a group dedicated to winning lesbians the right to keep their children after separating from their male partners. She also joined the London Lesbian Line collective and was a member of the disabled gay rights group, Regard. With Hillary Torrence she co-organised Women for Improved Transport (WTI) in 1984, with the objective of calling “attention to the needs of all women using London Transport, with particular regard to matters of safety and access.”\n\n\n=== Disability rights ===\nBashell became a wheelchair user and experienced “numerous incidents of disability-targeted hostility on the buses”, including a driver who refused to come close enough to the kerb for her to board, saying “she shouldn’t be out at that time of night” (it was 10pm on a weekday). In 1989 she co-founded Campaign for Accessible Transport (CAT).

        "content": "Lieutenant general Orwin C. Talbott (18 June 1918 – 26 April 2011) was a United States Army officer who served in World War II and the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOrwin Talbott was born on 18 June 1918 in San Jose, California to Ernest Orwin Talbott (1885–1951) and his wife Anna Violet Smith. His father was the principal of Molinos High School and his mother was a teacher at another school. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, but did not graduate.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nIn 1941, he joined the U.S. Army. During World War II, he served in the 359th Infantry Regiment, part of the 90th Infantry Division. He first became a company commander and later a battalion commander. He and his unit took part in the Allied landings in Normandy, where his troop transport the USS Susan B. Anthony was sunk by mines off Utah Beach on 7 June 1944. He was awarded the Silver Star twice during the war.\nAfter the war, Talbott stayed in the Army. Between 1959 and 1963 he was a member of the staff of General Lyman Lemnitzer who served as Chief of Staff of the Army (1959–1960), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1960–1962) and Supreme Allied Commander Europe. In 1963, Talbott left Lemnitzer's staff. Subsequently, he commanded a brigade of the 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg, West Germany. He was later transferred to Fort Carson, Colorado, where he served on the staff of the 5th Infantry Division.\nIn 1968 he was transferred to South Vietnam where he served as assistant division commander of the \n1st Infantry Division. In September 1968 he assumed command of the division after General Keith L. Ware died when his helicopter was shot down. In October he received a third Silver Star. He hosted the visit by President Richard Nixon to the division's Dĩ An Base Camp on 31 July 1969. Talbott retained command of the division until August 1969. \nIn September 1969, he assumed command of Fort Benning. In this capacity, Talbott oversaw the trial of William Calley for his role in the My Lai massacre.\nIn 1973 he was promoted to Lieutenant general. At the same time, he became deputy commander of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. He retired from the Army in 1975.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nFollowing his retirement from the Army he lived in Annapolis, Maryland. There he was head of the Maryland Historical Trust for six years. In 1983, together with other retired generals Lyman L. Lemnitzer and Bruce Palmer Jr. he established the Army Historical Foundation. In 1994 he introduced President Bill Clinton during the 50th anniversary ceremony of the Normandy landings at Utah Beach. In 1999, he moved to Washington, D.C.. He died of a heart attack at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 26 April 2011. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== Decorations ==\nHis decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal (2), Silver Star (3), Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross (4), Bronze Star (3), Purple Heart (3), Legion of Honour (France), Croix de Guerre (France) and Gallantry Cross (South Vietnam).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Forged: A Life Drama, of English and Australian Interest is a 1873 Australian stage play by Arch Murray.\nThe story was inspired by Bully Hayes. The play was published in 1873.\nLeslie Rees commented:\n\nJudging from the text the play is actable, but the character of Wayes as an interesting and dominating scoundrel is insufficiently developed. In the dialogue there is competence but little charm. The characters make revolutionary decisions without warning the reader — a common fault of the inexperienced dramatist, though not to be taken too seriously in melodrama. Diana could be a more appealing heroine — if heroine she remains, for it is an Australian girl who decamps with the squatter. The play has some historical value as emphasizing the notorious fascination of The Gap for wouldbe suicides—even in 1873.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1995 Choco Earthquake, also known as the 1995 Cali Earthquake or 1995 Darien Earthquake, was a moment magnitude 6.4 that struck the Valle del Cauca, Choco, and Risaralda departments of Colombia on February 8, at 18:40 UTC, with the epicenter being located 24 kilometres (15 mi) NW of the town of Darién. The earthquake was felt throughout all of Colombia, and major damage was reported.\nIt would be the strongest earthquake to hit Colombia since the Páez River earthquake in 1994, and the strongest to hit the department of Valle del Cauca since the 1979 El Cairo earthquake.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a depth of 73.5 kilometres (45.7 mi). The epicenter was 24 kilometres (15 mi) NW of the town of Darién, at 4.104°N 76.622°W. Tremors were felt across Colombia, reaching as far out as Bogota. Due to the location of the earthquake and its tectonic setting, it was not as strong in parts such as Northern Colombia.\nAftershocks were later reported with various magnitudes ranging between 3.0 and 5.6. \n\n\n== Impact ==\nOver 2,000 buildings across the area were damaged and 700 were reported to have collapsed. 4 schools and 22 community centers in the areas affected were damaged, as well as a provincial government building, colleges, police stations, and offices. Telephone poles were destroyed, and utilities such as electricity and water were cut off as water mains burst and wires were split. Two highways were blocked due to landslides that were caused by the earthquake.\nShortly after the earthquake, relief teams were deployed made up of Red Cross personnel, firemen, policemen, and civil defense officers. A state of emergency was later declared by the Colombian Government in response to the earthquake. Many walls and buildings had collapsed, causing multiple deaths in towns such as Palestina, Armenia, and Pereria.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOver 7,000 people were impacted by the earthquake. 3,000 were left homeless due to the substantial damage caused by the quake. Immediately after the initial earthquake, medical teams were sent out to aid people who were injured, with some cases having to airlift patients due to the damage. Blood was brought to victims who required it from national resources, and first aid tents were set up.\nRelief supplies were sent out, with kits including corrugated iron and plastic sheets, mattresses, blankets, sanitation kits, and emergency food rations. Cash grants of US$20,000 (equivalent to $39,991 in 2023) were given out to people as well for personal belonging replacements.\nMany homeless people stayed with their friends or relatives on industrialized areas or coffee farms, while others were brought to temporary shelters set up in schools or tent camps. During reconstruction, there were concerns about housing for the homeless.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in Colombia\nList of earthquakes in 1995\n1994 Paez River earthquake\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Foiled, or Australia Twenty Years Ago is a 1871 Australian stage play by Walter Cooper.\nThe play was popular and was still being revived fifteen years after Cooper's death.\nAccording to Leslie Rees the play \"was no less riotous and tropic-hued in plot than other melodramas of the period. It was filled to the neck with villainy. It contained... what was probably the first example of that breath-dispelling, blood-refrigerating type of incident so often copied by the silent films of two generations later, wherein a man is tied to a log in a timber mill and slowly directed towards the engine-driven saw, only to be saved from bisection in the nick of time.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Sydney Evening News said \"the characters are boldly sketched and well contrasted one with another, the dialogue is unstrained and well pointed, and the details of the plot are elaborated in a manner which produces an unflagging interest in the piece throughout its performance.\"\nThe Age said \"The piece is of considerable merit in its way, and will compare favorably with any of the later productions\nof Bouoicault.\"\nThe Argus, reviewing a 1879 revival, said the play \"is made up of stock materials and it ends with a stock sensation scene\" but allowed \"its construction is so much better than the average that there is no flagging in the interest and the episodal filling in is judiciously distributed. It is not a high class play but it is a play one may sit out withought weariness. Moreover it is Australian and most of the characters have a local colour which helps the interest proportionally.\"\nThe Geelong Advertiser called it \"an unqualified success\".\nThe play may have been performed in the USA.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFoiled at Ausstage",

        "content": "Helen Drage Little (b. Winchester, 1871 d. York, 8 Nov 1933) led a successful fundraising campaign in 1922 to restore the Five Sisters window of York Minster and have it dedicated to the women of the British Empire who died in the line of service during World War I.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHelen Drage Beckwith was born to Rev. George and Emily Jane Beckwith in Winchester, Hampshire in 1871. She had a younger brother Arthur. At least two sisters died in infancy.\nShe married Colonel Charles Blakeway Little of Somerset Light Infantry at Winchester Cathedral on 10 January 1899. She died at St Peter's Grove, York.\n\n\n== World War I ==\nLittle was in Cairo when the first trainloads of wounded arrived from Gallipoli. She wrote that she \"was witness to the untiring devotion under great difficulties of the nurses and other women who gave themselves up, entirely regardless of their own health, in some cases with fatal results, to alleviate the suffering of the men.\" After the war, she noted that \"when memorials on all sides were being erected to our brothers, I often thought that our sisters who also made the same sacrifice appeared to have been forgotten.\"\n\n\n== Five Sisters window, York Minster ==\n\nLittle first visited York Minster in 1909. She said the Five Sisters window, \"in its quaint simplicity, quiet dignity\", had made a lasting impression on her.\n\n\n=== Little's vision ===\nOn 30 November 1922 Little had a vision. She detailed it in a letter which was published posthumously in The Times. In her vision she was in the Minster and saw two of her sisters, who had both died in infancy, pointing towards the Five Sisters window. It then moved, as if on hinges, to reveal a garden behind it. In the garden was a tree under which sat five women, all weaving. In the distance girls and women \"came gliding up the garden in misty grey-blue garments.\" The window then swung back into place with her sisters both still pointing at it. She woke up and cried out \"The Sisters Window for the sisters.\"\n\nThis vision led Little to propose that the restoration of the Five Sisters window be completed in memory of the women of the Empire who gave their lives in service during WWI. (During the war the Minster's windows were removed for safety, when it was discovered they were in need of significant restoration.) The Dean immediately accepted her proposal and fundraising efforts began.\nLittle was the joint honourable secretary, together with Almyra Gray, for the fundraising effort for the Five Sisters window memorial. Within nine weeks, 32,000 people had donated a total of £3,500 (equivalent to £165,000 in 2024). The window was reinstalled, together with ten oak panels listing the names of all the women who died in the line of service, and the dedication service was held in June 1925.\n\n\n=== After Little's death ===\nThe first part of Little's funeral took place at York Minster's Chapel of St Nicholas (which also forms part of the memorial). It was attended by the Yorkshire School for the Blind, the Voluntary Aid Detachment, the Primrose League, the County Hospital Linen Guild, the National Council of Women Workers and Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps. The subsequent part of the funeral was held in Winchester.\nAfter Little's death the executors of her will donated the archives of the Five Sisters fundraising effort to York Minster's archive.\n\n\n== Other roles held by Little ==\nClifton Women's Conservative Association - chair\nConservative Women's Central Advisory Committee - chair\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "IC 5145 is a type Sab spiral galaxy located in the constellation Pegasus. It is located 356 million light-years from the Solar System and was discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard, although the year he discovered it is unknown.\nThe luminosity class of IC 5145 is I-II and it has a broad H II region. Its dimensions measure 1.60 x 0.9 arcmin.\n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nFive supernovae have been discovered in IC 5145 so far: SN 2002dn, SN 2003hy, SN 2010iq, PSN J21542359+1509224 and SN 2022lfa.\nSN 2002dn\nSN 2002dn was discovered in IC 5145 by astronomer W. D. Li from University of California at Berkeley via unfiltered KAIT CCD images taken on June 15 and June 17, 2002. It was located 8\".8 west and 18\".3 north of the nucleus. A further inspection done by A. V. Filippenko, R. Chornock and R. J. Foley, using the Shane 3-m reflector at Lick Observatory confirmed SN 2002dn was a Type Ic supernova which resembled SN 1987m.\nSN 2003hy\nSN 2003hy was discovered by British amateur astronomer, Tom Boles from Coddenham, England on September 14, through unfiltered CCD images using a 0.35-m reflector as part of the course done by U.K. Nova/Supernova Patrol. Surprising, SN 2003hy was also discovered by another amateur astronomer, Mark Armstrong who saw it on the same unfiltered CCD images and via a 0.35m reflector. It had a magnitude of 16.6 and was located 5\".5 west and 12\".5 north of the nucleus. The supernova was Type IIn.\nA 14-minute exposure of SN 2003hy taken on December 28, 2003, shows it is much dimmer than 19.4 magnitude, which the dimmest stars are magnitude 20.\nSN 2010iq\nLick Observatory Supernova Search discovered SN 2010iq on October 11, 2010. It was reported by A. Narla, S. B. Cenko, W. Li and A. V. Filippenko from University of California, Berkeley through unfiltered CCD images. It was located 2\".8 east and 4\".4 south of the nucleus with a magnitude of 18.2. This supernova was Type Ic.\nPSN J21542359+1509224\nPSN J21542359+1509224 was discovered on 13 May 2014 by Bin Wang and Xing Gao. It was located 5\".3 east and 0\".9 south of the nucleus with a magnitude of 18.3. This supernova had an unknown type.\nSN 2022lfa\nSN 2022lfa was discovered on May 28, 2022, by Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) through Palomar 1.2m Oschin telescope on the behalf of K. De from Caltech. On June 28, 2022, astronomers confirmed that SN 2022lfa is a Type Ic supernova via a spectrum obtained on MJD 59755.43 using the 3-m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Islet in the Sky is a sandstone pillar located within Canyonlands National Park, in San Juan County, Utah, United States. It is situated in the Island in the Sky District of the park, one mile (1.6 km) east of the Island in the Sky paved road that leads to Grand View Point. This spire is composed of Wingate Sandstone, which is the remains of wind-borne sand dunes deposited approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic. Precipitation runoff from Islet in the Sky drains east to the nearby Colorado River via Buck Canyon. Access is via the White Rim Road which traverses between this remote spire and the river.\n\n\n== Climbing ==\nThe first ascent of the summit was made by Ken Trout and Bruce Lella on November 22, 1979, via the north side. The climbing route is rated class 5.10+ A3.

        "content": "Benigno Belausteguigoitia Landaluce (16 January 1879 – Unknown) was a Spanish doctor and footballer who played as a defender for RCD Espanyol with he won the Catalan championship in 1904.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn to a wealthy family that was native to Llodio, Benigno was the third of the twelve children (eight men and four women) of the marriage formed by Federico and Dolores. His life was much more discreet than those of his brothers, some of whom were also football players, such as José María (1889), Santiago (1890) and Ramón (1891), who all played for Athletic Bilbao, while the others were writers, brilliant lawyers or illustrious scholars of the Basque language.\n\n\n== Professional carrer ==\nBelauste studied Medicine for almost twenty years at the Faculty of Barcelona and he took advantage of his stay in the Catalan capital to join the ranks of RCD Espanyol, playing as a defender for the club's second team. He specialized there in the throat, nose, and ears, and returned to Bilbao, where he worked as such at Gota de Leche, the Montepío de la Mujer que Trabajo and in his office on Calle de la Estación No. 8. He selflessly served in the Ledo office and for this reason, he was granted entry into the Civil Order of Charity.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Belauste remained in Bilbao. There was no news that he suffered persecution by the Franco authorities, unlike his brothers, several of whom went into exile in Mexico. He continued to work after the war and enjoyed a good name among the population and among his medical colleagues. Cultured man, member of Eusko Ikaskuntza, he dedicated his free time to the study of eating habits and Basque Popular Medicine. He wrote about both topics in the magazine Vida Vasca.\n\n\n== Playing carrer ==\n\n\n=== Bilbao FC ===\nIn the late 1890s, Belauste became a member of an informal group led by Carlos and Manuel Castellanos, the so-called Bilbao Football Club, the first entity to play football in Bilbao since the disappearance of Club Atleta. Although it was formed in 1896, it was not until 30 November 1900 that the Bilbao Football Club was officially established in a meeting held in the house of industrialist José Luis de Villabaso (1852–1917) in the Biscayan neighborhood of Algorta. However, before he even could play one match for the club, he moved to Barcelona to complete his studies, and there he joined the ranks of Espanyol.\n\n\n=== RCD Espanyol ===\nTogether with Ángel Ponz, Gustavo Green, Emilio Sampere, and the three Joaquins (Escardó, Carril, and García), Belauste was part of the team that won the first edition of the Campionat de Catalunya in 1903–04.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBelauste married the Cuban Ysabel de Azcue Gorostizaga, and the couple had three children Manuel, Ramón, and Javier Belausteguigoitia Azcue.\nBelauste died in Bilbao in 1946, at the age of either 66 or 67.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRCD Espanyol\n\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (1): 1903–04\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrés Aranda Gutiérrez (7 August 1905 – 10 March 1965) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Real Betis, and later a manager, taking charge over Betis and Recreativo de Huelva.\nHe began his career as a player at Real Betis in 1921, aged 16, remaining there for 13 uninterrupted seasons until the 1933–34 season, being one of the team's most outstanding players during those years, in which they won the Andalusian championship in 1928 and reached the final of the 1931 Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao. He was a very versatile player, who covered almost all positions on the field, starting his career as a defender, later moving on to play inside on both sides, even playing as a goalkeeper, always characterized by great dedication.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAndrés Aranda was born in the Sevillian town of Lora del Río on 7 August 1905, moving to Seville in 1917, at the age of 12. The Aranda family settled in the Puerta Real neighborhood, and there, the young Andrés was part of one of the many popular teams that made up the local categories, such as Estrella FC and Agrupación Deportiva Museo. In this team, he and teammate Manuel Nogueras quickly stood out from the rest and they eventually drew the attention of Betis, with Aranda joining their ranks in 1921, when he was 16 years old, and both went on to become very important footballers during the 1920s.\nAranda made his official debut with Betis on 13 November 1921, on the first day of the Andalusian Championship, helping his side to a 3–1 victory over Sevilla FC. In doing so at the age of 16 years and 104 days, he remains the youngest footballer in the history of the club to officially wear the Betis jersey of the first team, since Juan Baena, who debuted with a little over 15 years old, did it in a friendly match. Aranda was a very versatile player, who covered almost all positions on the field, including goalkeeper: in a friendly match against Recreativo de Huelva on 23 December 1923, where he replaced the injured Jesús, and then he did it again against Deportivo de La Coruña, he replaced the injured Jesús again in a League match. He was a true wild card, standing out for his dedication and fight although he was also a player with technique.\nAranda played with Betis for over a decade, initially as a defender, but then developed into a lethal striker, becoming one of the main architects of the team's football power in Andalusia, competing head-to-head against Sevilla, finishing as the runner-ups of the Andalusian championship for five consecutive years (1922–23, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27) before finally winning it 1928. Sevilla, who had greater economic and social power, was constantly plundering his rival's best players, but Aranda always refused their offers and remained loyal to Betis, and following the regulation of professionalism in 1926, which brought order to the football market, Aranda saw how Betis grew throughout the second half of the 1920s, winning the Andalusian championship in 1928, premiering the Estadio de Nervión with victory in 1929, reaching the Cup final in 1931, which they lost 1–3 to Athletic Bilbao, and achieving promotion to the First Division in 1932.\nAranda also traveled on the tour of Germany in 1925, in which he was baptized as \"the Scientist\". In the following year, he was a member of the first Betis side that played in the Copa del Rey and that won La Copa Spencer in 1926, named after the recently deceased Sevilla player, whose coffin was carried by Aranda, among others, through the streets of Seville.\nAranda had to retire in 1933 due to an annoying ankle injury, playing his last game on the Christmas Day of 1933 in Nervión, in a friendly match against the Sevilla reserves. He retired with a total of almost 300 official and friendly matches with Real Betis. On 8 September 1940, Aranda received a tribute match from Real Betis before a friendly between Betis and Xerez FC.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nIn 1934, almost immediately after leaving active football, Aranda joined the Betis youth team as a coach and entered the technical ranks of the club, being in charge of preparing the amateur team that won the 1934–35 amateur Andalusian championship. Despite being a man of good humor, his iron discipline led him to be the \"father\" of the team, since his companions respected him without question due to being a natural leader. At the beginning of the 1935–36 season, in October 1935, at only 30 years old, Aranda took over the management of the first team during the regional championship, as well as in the league, to replace the Irishman Patrick O'Connell after his departure to FC Barcelona and after the Englishman Charlie Slade had failed with embarrassing defeats to Xerez, Racing de Córdoba, Mirandilla FC, and CD Malacitano. Despite picking up Betis not only in a bad run of form, but also devalued compared to the previous year after the departure of Pedro Areso and Simón Lecue, Aranda still managed to lead them to the middle of the table in a quiet 7th position in the 1935–36 season, although they were knocked out from the cup in the quarterfinals by CA Osasuna on 31 May 1936, which was the last official match of any Sevillian team until January 1939.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Aranda became the coach of the Aviation team of the Air Region in the improvised Seville Tournament, with Sevilla players of the likes of López, Pepillo, Berrocal, a renowned offensive line at Sevilla called the \"Stuka\". He led Betis again at the end of the Civil War in 1939, marking his return with a 0–1 loss to Cadiz CF on 22 January. He coached Betis in both the Andalusian Championship, in which they achieved runners-up status, and in the 1939–40 La Liga, in which Betis, who had a squad devastated by the war, could not avoid relegation to the Segunda División.\nAlthough he never left Betis as a footballer, Aranda did not do so on the bench, taking charge of Xerez FC in 1941, thus ending his 20-year-old stint with Betis. His good performance there, such as a runner-up finish in the Segunda División in 1942–43 led him to return to Betis, who was striving to return to First Division in the mid-40s. After failing to achieve this, he continued his pilgrimage through the benches in Andalusia and Extremadura, coaching the likes of Real Jaén (1945–48), Recreativo de Huelva (1948–49 and 1954–55), CF Extremadura (1952–53) and Ayamonte CF (1959–60), in addition to returning to the Betis bench for two campaigns in the Tercera División in 1949–50 and 1950–51, also appearing as a member of the Verdiblanco affiliate, Juventud Balompié.\nStarting in 1960, with the arrival of Benito Villamarín to the presidency of Betis, Aranda returned to his club. His only disagreement was with Antonio Barrios, the coach who promoted the team to First Division in 1958, which led him in those years to move to Ayamonte where despite being a member of the Governing Board of Coaches of the Andalusian Football Federation, Aranda took charge of the modest Ayamonte in 1958, which at that time was a subsidiary of Betis, doing so until 1960, when he was finally reincorporated into Betis.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nIn 1960, Aranda joined the technical roster of Betis, and remained in that position until 1965, when in March he was called to replace Rosendo Hernández from the Canary Islands on a provisional basis on the first team bench. In his debut for the fifth time on the Betis bench on 7 March, Betis lost in Altabix 3–1 to Elche CF. From there, Betis moved to the town of Sierra de Aracena, having taken advantage of a league break to try to remedy a disastrous streak of seven defeats in a row that seriously endangered the permanence of the club in the First Division, holding a Betis team concentration preparing for the league match against Real Zaragoza. They trained on the local field and returned to the hotel near the Casino Arias Montano, where Aranda watched some games of billiards during the night and immediately retired to his room, where the masseuse Vicente Montiel noticed loud snoring in his rooms, so he went to them and found Andrés sitting in a chair and unconscious. Montiel immediately called the town's doctor urgently, arranging for Aranda's transfer to Seville, but he died during the trip the veteran green and white coach must have died on 10 March 1965, at the age of 59, due to angina pectoris.\nHis funeral was held the following day in Seville and led to a large mobilization of Betis fans, with an impressive demonstration of family, friends, players, and the club's board of directors while the coffin was carried on the shoulders of his former teammates and the players of that time until his house on Alfonso XII Street. In the pages of Marca, journalist Carlos Méndez \"Cronos\" dedicated a tribute article to him titled \"With the boots on\".\n\n\n== Honours ==\nReal Betis\n\nAndalusian championship:\nChampions (1): 1928\nCopa del Rey:\nRunner-up (1): 1931\nSegunda División:\nChampions (1): 1931–32\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eleanor Mary \"Ella\" Latham CBE (née Tobin; 10 October 1878 – 26 March 1964) was an Australian charity worker and hospital administrator. She served as president of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne from 1933 to 1954.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLatham was born on 10 October 1878 in Northcote, Victoria. She was the only child of schoolteachers Fanny Louisa (née Matthews) and Richard Tobin, who lived along Merri Creek. Her father authored the petition for the creation of the Borough of Northcote in 1883.\nLatham attended the University High School, Melbourne, and went on to graduate Bachelor of Arts from the University of Melbourne in 1904. The following year she and her friend Jessie Webb published a poetry anthology titled Phases of Literature from Pope to Browning: Prose and Verse Selections. After graduation she worked as a schoolteacher until her marriage in 1907, when she was required to resign in accordance with the marriage bar in place at the time.\n\n\n== Public life ==\nLatham had a long-standing involvement with Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital (RCH). She joined a suburban auxiliary (volunteer group) in 1923 and in 1926 was appointed to the hospital's management committee. She served as president of the committee from 1933 to 1954, resigning after grooming Elisabeth Murdoch as her successor. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the same year.\nAlong with medical director Vernon Collins and lady superintendent Lucy de Neeve, Latham oversaw the transformation of RCH from \"a charity hospital to an institution that provided medical services of the highest quality, education and training facilities for staff, a research organization in both curative and preventive medicine, and a link with the university\". In 1946 she launched an appeal for a complete rebuild of the hospital closer to existing medical research institutions, which eventuated in 1963 with the hospital's move to Parkville. One of her innovations was the introduction of an independent medical advisory board to advise the committee on appointments of senior medical staff.\nLatham had a particular interest in paediatric orthopaedics and in 1935 co-founded the Victorian Society for Crippled Children (now part of Yooralla). She helped establish a rehabilitation centre for disabled children at Frankston, including a \"craft hostel\" providing training in carpentry and home economics. After World War II she conducted a study tour of orthopaedic hospitals in the United Kingdom. \nLatham was a founding member of Melbourne's Lyceum Club in 1912 and later served as president from 1925 to 1926. She also served on the national committee of the Australian Red Cross, serving as the delegate for the territorial divisions of New Guinea, Norfolk Island, the Northern Territory, and Papua.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nLatham married John Greig Latham in 1907, with whom she had three children. The couple were predeceased by their daughter Freda, who died from complications of diabetes, and older son Richard, who was killed in World War II.\nLatham died on 26 March 1964, aged 85. Her husband died a few months later.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The head axe,  also known as headhunter's axe, is a battle axe of the Cordilleran peoples of the Philippines specialized for beheading enemy combatants during headhunting raids. They are distinctively shaped, with concave or straight blades and elongated upper corners. They also have a protruding stub or spike near the bottom end of the haft for better grip. Their native names and designs varied by ethnic group, ranging from axes with curving slender designs to heavy axes with straight edges. Head axes, like most other pre-colonial bladed weapons of the Philippines, were also utilitarian. They were also used for cutting trees, clearing undergrowth, or even cutting hair.\nHead axes were outlawed, along with headhunting practices, during the American colonial period of the Philippines in the early 20th century. They have largely been replaced with the bolos of lowlander Filipino cultures.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPanabas\nKalasag\nSibat\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Olive Blackham (1899–2002) was a British puppeteer. She was the director of the experimental Roel Puppets theatre company, author of Shadow Puppets (1961) and “one of the leading authorities on all forms of puppetry”. In 1948 she was one of the first puppeteers to appear on television, in a broadcast from Alexandra Palace.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBlackham was born in West Bromwich to Harriet and Walter Blackham. She was the oldest of four siblings. A brother was the philosopher Harold John Blackham. Blackham attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, after which she worked for a bank in Birmingham. In 1932 she moved to Roel Farm, Cheltenham where she established the Roel Puppets theatre company. During WWII she worked at Lloyd's Bank in Montpellier.\nIn the mid-1960s she retired to Cheltenham. After donating her puppets to several museums, she turned her attention to weaving. She died at the Sherborne Tower Care Centre, aged 103. In lieu of flowers, donations were made to the Puppet Centre Trust.\n\n\n== Puppetry career ==\nWhile working as a bank clerk in the early 1930s, Blackham read a book on puppetry and was inspired to put on a “little show on the dining-room table” for her family. The following year her brother built her a stage, which focused her interest. Eventually “so many friends came to see her puppet, that [she] took a loft over a stable in Kings Heath” in 1927, which became a small experimental theatre, The Ark. The name was inspired by the stable's appearance, its entrance being up a ladder and through a trap door.\n\n\n== The Ark ==\nBlackham ran The Ark with a group of friends, including Bernard Griffin, Gerald Shaw and Frances Norris. Blackham wrote the plays, designed the sets and made the costumes. Of The Ark she said, \"It is not run merely to entertain. It is a puppet theatre workshop where we can experiment in every form of theatre activity in miniature. It is the outcome of a revolt against the cramping conditions the modern playwrights have imposed upon theatre and against the spiritual weariness their fare induces. We are experimenting with puppets in the belief that they can lead the way to a more beautiful and satisfying theatre.\"\nThe Ark ran from 1927 to 1932, at which point she decided to give up her job and make puppets her career.\n\n\n== Roel Puppets Theatre ==\nWith money she had saved from her work, she moved to the Cotswolds in 1932 and bought a granary belonging to Roel Farm in Guiting Power where she established the Roel Puppets theatre company. Active until 1961, it put on performances each spring and summer, and toured during autumn and winter, playing at theatres, colleges and private houses.\nBetween 1936 and 1958 Blackham would run an annual summer school where participants would create their own puppets and visit the nearby Lanchester Marionettes Theatre in Malvern. The Roel Puppets’ patron was Sir Barry Jackson. Her long-time assistant was Amina Chatwin. Other puppeteers who worked in the company included: Mary Morley, Joyce Blackham, Gray Skipworth and Robert Tronson.\nIn 1937 Roel Puppets were chosen by the British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild to represent British puppet theatre at the 1937 Paris Exhibition. In 1939 the theatre historian George Speaight worked with her to learn the art of puppetry.\n\n\n=== Experimental ideas ===\nBlackham “tested the possibilities of the marionette as an art form”. Her experimental ideas included:\n\nFor Alfred Kreymborg’s 1925 play Lima Beans, Blackham made faceless puppets; the woman’s head was a sphere, the man’s was a cube, and “the audience’s imagination was stirred to invent features and changes of expression.”\nRather than making the mannequin's strings as invisible as possible, she experimented with making them thick and “brightly coloured against a neutral background.”\nRather than using the traditional wooden ‘control’ or ‘perch’ for the strings of marionettes, she attached them to the fingertips of a pair of gloves.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring WWII Blackham toured extensively with a simpler theatre using glove puppets, as it was “impossible to obtain the transport for the complicated mechanism necessary for a string show”. In 1939 some of Blackham's students took puppet-making and manipulation techniques into evacuation camps. In November of the same year the Cannon Hall Museum, Birmingham, which was closed at the outbreak of the war, with all its permanent collection moved to safety, reopened with an “exhibition of theatrical designs and puppets”, including puppets made by Blackham.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\nIn 1948 the Roel Puppets appeared on a television programme broadcast from Alexandra Palace. Puppet Pie was a 30-minute show featuring Blackham's glove and rod puppets. In the same year she appeared at the Cheltenham Music Festival. In 1950 the Roel Puppets appeared on the BBC show Children’s Newsreel. In 1960 Blackham worked with costume designer and Thunderbirds wardrobe supervisor, Elizabeth Coleman. She also worked with Welsh puppeteer Jane Phillips. In 1966, at the point of her retirement, she became the first British member of the French organisation, Union Internationale de la Marionette (UNIMA).\nIn 1992 three of her Japanese Noh puppets were exhibited at Cheltenham's Pittville Pump Room alongside many other historical puppets, including the original Muffin the Mule.\n\n\n== Shows ==\nBlackham's output was varied, including contemporary verse plays, farces, burlesques, and satires:\n\n\n=== Pre-war productions ===\nLima Beans: A Scherzo Play in One Act (1925) by Alfred Kreymborg\nCrescent Theatre, Birmingham (November 1933)\nMunicipal Players' Theatre, Birmingham (December 1933)\nEngineer's Institute, Cardiff (November 1934)\nGloucester School of Art (November 1934)\nBerwick High School (November 1935)\nUnity Theatre Club for the International Puppet Show, London (October 1936)\nCurtain Theatre, Rochdale (October 1936)\nPlayers' Theatre, Covent Garden (December 1936)\nBluecoat Hall, Liverpool (January 1937)\nHaileybury College, Hertfordshire (December 1939)\n\n\n=== Post-war productions ===\nChester Miracle Plays including Abraham and Isaac in the style of Noh theatre, with figures designed by Bernard Griffin and music by C Sumsion\nThe Clown and his Dog\nThe Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò\nDog into Sausage written by Blackham (with paper clowns made by Margaret Hoyland)\nThe Early Bird a ballet with music by Paul Dukas\nHagoromo\nKinuta – a Noh play with puppets made by Gerald Shaw\nPeople Who Die by Alfred Kreymborg (with carvings by Gerald Shaw)\nTwo medieval Chinese plays including A Princely Fortune\nThe Proposal by Anton Chekhov\nScenes from The Tempest by Shakespeare\nSt George and the Turkish Knight mummers' play\nThe Unwilling Martyr by Anton Chekhov\nWidecome Fair\n\n\n== Books ==\nBlackham wrote the following books:\n\nPuppets into Actors (1948) with drawings by F E Norris.

        "content": "Raoul Kernumees (until 1936 Raoul Kirnmann; October 25, 1905 – June 25, 1990) was an Estonian printmaker and painter.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKernumees was born in Udeva, the son of Juhan Kernumees (né Kirnmann, 1862–?) and Anna Maria Kirnmann (née Kontrakt, 1877–1918). He was the youngest child in a family of five children. He started his schooling at the Rakvere Educational Society School, and his next-door neighbor was the future artist Hando Mugasto.\nIn 1917, the family moved to Tallinn. In 1918, he started studying at Tallinn City High School on Vene tänav (Russian Street). His drawing teacher there noticed Kernumees's artistic talent and advised him to continue his studies at the State Industrial Art School. Kernumees studied there from 1921 to 1923. In 1925, Kernumees, together with Erich Leps, Kaarel Liimand, and Andrus Johani, went to study at the Pallas Art School in Tartu. His studies at Pallas were interrupted (1925–1927, 1930–1931, 1933) due to both financial reasons and the tuberculosis that shattered his health in 1927. Kernumees's name first appears in the catalog of exhibition works by Pallas students in 1925.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKernumees started presenting his work at art exhibitions in 1931, mainly with prints. In 1932, the Estonian Government Foundation for the Fine Arts acquired four of Kernumees's works: Külakõrts (Village Inn), Põrgu (Hell), Peaparandus (Hair of the Dog), and Tulekahi (Conflagration), and he was awarded a scholarship for six months (his fellow scholarship recipient was Eduard Timberman). From then on, Kernumees consistently exhibited almost every year, except for the more severe years of his illness from 1936 to 1938. In 1942, the publisher Eesti Kirjastus ordered illustrations from Kernumees for the Nibelungenlied translated by Marta Sillaots. Kernumees created 12 ink drawings, but they were lost in the chaos of the war, and the book was never published. However, these illustrations were exhibited once in 1944. Kernumees also continued to participate in exhibitions in Estonia under Soviet rule.\n\n\n== Works ==\nKernumees attracted attention as an especially virtuosic and detailed draftsman, and a master of figural compositions. He mainly portrayed villagers, whose monotonous everyday life was enhanced by a bottle of vodka and a song accompanied by an accordion. Nationalism also characterizes Kernumees's fantastic grotesque drawings; for example, Põrgu (Hell; 1931, ink, Art Museum of Estonia), created at the same time as Eduard Wiiralt's etching of the same name. In addition to painting landscapes and still lifes in oil, Kernumees was also a portraitist, mainly in pastel. He painted many portraits of cultural figures.\n\n\n== Family ==\nKernumees married Liidia Kivikas (1913–1985); their daughter was the artist Maret Kernumees (1934–1997) and their son was the musician Koit Kernumees (1947–2011). The artist Valdur Ohakas was Kernumees's nephew.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mafaz Al-Suwaidan (born November 21, 1990) is a Kuwaiti academic who is currently a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. She is also a producer and writer for American Muslims (2024), a series of short documentary films about Muslims in America.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nMafaz was born in Oklahoma to Islamic author and speaker, Tareq Al-Suwaidan, who is also a leader of Kuwait's Muslim Brotherhood. Although Mafaz was born in the US, she has lived in Kuwait for most of her life.\nIn 2010, she married singer-songwriter Humood AlKhudher. They have two children.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMafaz got her undergraduate degree in journalism from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) in 2011, after which she worked as a journalist in Kuwait. In 2016, she received her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in creative writing from Emerson College, Boston.\nShe got her Master of Theological Study (MTS) degree in Islamic Studies from Harvard Divinity School in 2018. She is currently at Harvard as a PhD candidate in Philosophy of Religion focused on Islam and Modern Thought, with a secondary degree in African and African American Studies. She is also a member of the Committee on the Study of Religion.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nMafaz has been a vocal supporter of Palestine in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nShe has also participated in conversations about racism in the Arab world in context of the Black Lives Matter movement. \nIn 2021, when philosopher Cornel West had threatened to (and eventually did) leave Harvard after his request for tenure was denied; Al-Suwaidan, who had trained under West as a master's student, organized a letter of support for him, which was signed by more than 60 doctoral students.\nShe was one of the representatives of HGSU-UAW who wrote a letter in February 2024 to Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), on behalf of the UAW Arab Caucus, demanding the UAW divest from Israel.\nIn March 2024, she withdrew her participation from a Lowell House panel on antisemitism and Islamophobia, following criticism of the range of political views offered by the panelists.\nDue to her father's antisemitic statements which resulted in him being banned from the US and Belgium, and her anti-Zionist views, Mafaz has been accused of antisemitism by Canary Mission and The Daily Wire journalist Kassy Dillon. MEMRI had reported in 2022 about a YouTube video by Tareq Al-Suwaidan in which he described his daughter's anti-Israel activism at Harvard, urging young Arabs at Western universities to collaborate for the Palestinian cause.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peltigera castanea is a species of terricolous and muscicolous (ground- and moss-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. Described as a new species in 2003, it is part of the taxonomically challenging species complex centred around Peltigera didactyla. Recognised based on phylogenetic studies that highlighted its unique genetic markers, P. castanea is distinguished by its dark, chestnut-coloured upper surface, which inspired its vernacular name, chestnut pelt lichen. Its known distribution includes North America (British Columbia, Western Canada), Asia (China and Siberia), Europe (Estonia), Greenland, and the Antarctic. The conservation status of Peltigera castanea varies regionally, from being critically imperiled in British Columbia and Yukon to critically endangered in Estonia due to significant habitat degradation and restricted population size.\nPeltigera castanea is distinguished by its foliose, leaf-like thallus that loosely attaches to the substrate, covering up to 8 cm (3+1⁄8 in) with stiff, overlapping lobes that often curl upwards. Its distinctive upper surface is chestnut-brown, turning pale bluish-grey when sheltered, and features granular soredia for vegetative reproduction, housed within irregularly shaped soralia. The lichen's densely veined lower surface transitions from white to black, with tufted rhizines that become woolly towards the centre. Compared to related species in the genus Peltigera, such as P. extenuata and P. didactyla, P. castanea has a smooth, shiny, mostly non-tomentose upper cortex, darkening veins, and flocculent, often tufted rhizines, whereas its relatives show variations in lobe concavity and surface texture, including the presence of apothecia (fruiting bodies).\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nPeltigera castanea was scientifically described as a new species in 2003 by the lichenologists Trevor Goward, Bernard Goffinet, and Jolanta Miądlikowska. The lichen falls within the Peltigera didactyla species complex, a group known for its taxonomic challenges due to subtle morphological differences among its members. The species was officially recognised following phylogenetic studies, which identified it as a distinct monophyletic group—a unique evolutionary lineage—separate from other members of the Peltigera didactyla complex. These studies were based on DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and the large subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene, demonstrating that P. castanea forms a distinct lineage and highlighting genetic variations unique to this species.\nGoward collected the type specimen of Peltigera castanea in British Columbia's Clearwater River Basin, near Philip Creek along the Battle Mountain Road at an elevation of about 1,500 m (4,900 ft) on 1 October 2001. The specimen grew on a moss-covered boulder in an open, sunlit forest on a south-facing hillside. The species epithet castanea, meaning \"chestnut\", refers to the lichen's dark, chestnut-coloured upper surface, a trait that also inspired its vernacular name, \"chestnut pelt lichen\".\nPhylogenetically, Peltigera castanea is closely related to other species within the Peltigera didactyla complex, such as P. lambinonii and P. ulcerata. While sharing some morphological traits, P. castanea has unique genetic markers that confirm its distinct species status. The complex itself is part of a larger grouping of lichens that have been difficult to categorize due to their overlapping morphological traits and the subtleties in chemical and genetic distinctions.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPeltigera castanea can be differentiated from other species within its genus by several distinctive features of its thallus, a term which refers to the body of the lichen. The thallus of Peltigera castanea is foliose, meaning it is leaf-like and loosely attached to its substrate, covering areas up to 6–8 cm (2+3⁄8–3+1⁄8 in) across. The individual lobes comprising the thallus are stiff, fragile, and not much longer than they are wide, with a strong concavity or sometimes flat appearance, featuring loosely overlapping and irregularly branched patterns. The tips of the lobes are rounded and tend to curl upwards.\n\nThe upper surface of the thallus is notable for its dark chestnut-brown colour, which becomes a pale bluish grey when sheltered. The surface is more or less shiny and smooth except for being tomentose (covered with short, soft hairs) near the lobe tips. This surface is also characterised by the presence of soredia—granular reproductive structures that help in vegetative reproduction—found in rounded to irregularly shaped soralia (structures that house the soredia).\nThe lower surface of the lichen is densely veined, gradually shifting from white at the edges to brown or black near the centre. The rhizines (root-like structures underneath the lichen) are abundant, tufted, and become flocculent (woolly) towards the centre of the thallus, matching the colour of the veins.\nIn contrast, closely related species such as Peltigera praetextata have a smoother, more uniformly grey thallus with less prominent veining on the lower surface and a lack of strong colour contrast. Another similar species, Peltigera leucophlebia, has a broader thallus with a predominantly greenish hue and larger, more dispersed soralia.\nThe absence of apothecia (fruiting bodies) and the presence of frequent, marginal pycnidia (structures that produce asexual spores) containing ellipsoid pycnoconidia (asexual spores) further help in distinguishing Peltigera castanea from its congeners. These traits, combined with its unique colouration and texture, make Peltigera castanea a distinct species within its habitat. Like all Peltigera species, the photobiont of the lichen is cyanobacterial, visible as a dull bluish layer in the thallus. All of the standard chemical spot tests are negative in P. castanea, and no secondary metabolites (lichen products) have been detected using thin-layer chromatography.\n\n\n== Similar species ==\n\nSeveral species within the genus Peltigera genus resemble Peltigera castanea, yet they have distinctive morphological traits that aid in their identification. Peltigera castanea is known for its spreading lobes with a smooth, shiny, chestnut brown, mostly non-tomentose upper cortex. The veins darken and the flocculent rhizines are often tufted and form hedgerow-like structures. This species lacks apothecia but frequently features marginal pycnidia.\nClose in resemblance, Peltigera extenuata has flatter lobes with a duller, densely tomentose and minutely scabrid (crusty and rough) upper cortex that varies in colour from bluish grey to purplish brown when exposed to sunlight. Unlike P. castanea, the veins and rhizines in P. extenuata are typically pale, offering a stark contrast to the darkening veins seen in P. castanea.\nPeltigera ulcerata is distinguished from P. castanea by its shiny upper surface, which remains non-tomentose, including at the margins of the lobes, and by its generally elongated soralia.\nAnother species, Peltigera didactyla, also shares some similarities with P. castanea, particularly in terms of the potential shininess of the upper cortex. However, fertile specimens of P. didactyla are easily identifiable by the presence of a thick tomentum covering the upper surface and the occurrence of apothecia. Sterile specimens (i.e., those lacking apothecia) require more careful distinction, characterised by a more pouch-like habit and predominantly discrete, non-flocculent rhizines. Unlike P. castanea, the cortex of P. didactyla tends to have a predominantly purplish brown hue, distinct from the chestnut tone of P. castanea.\n\n\n== Habitat, distribution, and ecology ==\n\nPeltigera castanea predominantly inhabits mountainous forests and alpine heaths, typically growing in open, south-facing outcrops with ideal microclimate conditions. It grows on xerophytic moss mats, suggesting an affinity for drier, well-drained habitats. In Estonian alvar communities, it is commonly found with mosses such as Abietinella abietina, Bryum argentatum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Tortula ruralis, sharing its habitat with several rare, ground-dwelling lichens of arcto-alpine distribution.\nOriginally known only from northwestern North America, Peltigera castanea's range includes terricolous and muscicolous growth on rock outcrops from Alaska's Chilkoot Trail to Glacier Bay, extending east to the Yukon and south to Alberta's Rocky Mountains. Subsequent research has revealed its presence as far as northeast Greenland and even the Antarctic Peninsula, marking the species' adaptability to a wide range of cold environments.\nIt also occurs in Russia and Estonia. In 2023, the species was documented in Mount Xiaowutai, Hebei, China, and its 2020 discovery on James Ross Island in the Antarctic Peninsula marked the first record of the lichen in the Southern Hemisphere. It is one of eight Peltigera species that are known to occur in the Antarctic. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe conservation status of Peltigera castanea varies by region. In British Columbia, it is critically imperiled with an \"S1\" status and is listed as \"red\" on the B.C. List, indicating it is a candidate for Extirpated, Endangered, or Threatened status. However, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada has not yet assessed it. In Alberta, the species is classified as \"SU,\" denoting that it is unrankable due to insufficient information, while in the Yukon, it ranges from critically imperiled to imperiled (\"S1S2\").\nIn Estonia, the 2019 red list categorises Peltigera castanea as critically endangered. This designation is due to significant habitat degradation that has reduced its geographical range and habitat quality, along with its very small or restricted population size, which makes it highly vulnerable to extinction.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St John's Voices is the secondary choir of St John's College, Cambridge, alongside the College choir of St John's. Founded in 2013 to allow female members of the college to take part in the college's choral tradition, it is a mixed voice adult choir, comprising around 30 singers. As well as singing Choral Evensong in the College chapel, St John's voices gives frequent concerts, and has toured internationally. The choir's outreach has extended to Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The choir has also produced critically acclaimed recordings under the Naxos label, of works by William Mathias and Pavel Chesnokov.\n\n\n== Reactions to disbandment ==\nIn March 2024, the choir received written notice from the college that St John's Voices would be disbanded by June 2024. They stated that the decision was made to \"to adopt a broader approach to the provision of co-curricular opportunities in music for our students, including in different genres\". This decision caused widespread controversy, due to the reduction of opportunities for female singers. Despite the fact that St John's College choir has admitted women since 2022, it does not include soprano voices.\nMembers of St John's Voices initiated a campaign against the disbandment, condemning the decision as \"regressive\" in an open letter which received over 14,000 signatures. They stated that the admission of female singers into the Choir of St John's College had been \"weaponised against the very existence of another ensemble, supposedly in the name of broadening opportunities\". The open letter received national media attention from The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent, with notable supporters including Rowan Williams, Simon Rattle, Sarah Connolly, Gareth Malone, Alexander Armstrong, Anna Lapwood, and John Rutter.\nIn response to the protest, the college released a statement saying that the move was made to \"redirect the significant resources currently devoted to St John's Voices\", highlighting that the choir has recently expanded to include members from other colleges.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Doha Metropolitan Area (DMA; also known as Greater Doha Area) is the metropolitan area of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. The DMA comprises several contiguous cities and urban zones immediately surrounding Doha, serving as the main area of Qatar's population concentration. As of 2021, the population of the metropolitan area is upwards of 2 million.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe exact boundaries of the DMA are open to interpretation, with different definitions existing. However, at a minimum, the following areas are included in the DMA: \n\nAll of Ad-Dawhah Municipality\nParts of Al Rayyan Municipality\nAspire Zone\nEducation City\nDoha Industrial Area\nWholesale Market Area\nAl Rayyan City\nParts of Al Daayen Municipality\nSome definitions attribute a larger area to the DMA by including the entire urbanized section in the easternmost half of Al Rayyan Municipality, all of northern Al Wakrah Municipality terminating before Mesaieed, all of Umm Salal Municipality and all of Al Daayen Municipality, including the city of Lusail.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Doha Metropolitan Area has witnessed substantial growth since the 1980s, marking when Qatar began investing its hydrocarbon wealth into developing its infrastructure on a major scale. From 1984 to 2020, the metropolitan area expanded eightfold while the amount of bare land decreased by half.\nIn 2003, Greater Doha's urban confines primarily clustered around the downtown core. However, a gradual westward expansion, encompassing segments of Al Rayyan Municipality, mirrored the city's demographic influx. This foundational growth phase laid the groundwork for subsequent transformations of Greater Doha.\nA notable a milestone in Greater Doha's urbanization was the 2006 Asian Games, which catalyzed a rapid surge in urban development, directing attention towards the western districts and culminating in the development of the Aspire Zone. This urban sprawl coincided with the emergence of new residential developments.\nBy 2007, Greater Doha's geographical boundaries had expanded further, enveloping extensive swathes of Al Daayen Municipality. This sustained pattern of urbanization continued in the following years, characterized by progressions westward and northward. Since then, the traditional population centers of Greater Doha have shifted from densely populated downtown hubs to areas flanking the ring roads, encroaching into the neighboring municipalities of Al Rayyan and Al Daayen.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Toyota/Save Mart 350 is a stock car racing event in the NASCAR Cup Series that has been held annually at Sonoma Raceway at Sears Point in Sonoma, California since 1989. The 218.9-mile (352.3 km) race has been known as the Toyota/Save Mart 350 since 2007.\nThe race joined the NASCAR circuit in 1989. It was added as a replacement for the Budweiser 400 at Riverside, which closed in 1988. The race has undergone several name and length changes since its inception. The NASCAR \"West Series\" held a combination race from 1989 to 1997 and has held a standalone race since 2006. Due to the track's unique layout, the race generates annual discussion, with media, fans, and participants both in favor and against racing this event. Due to its unique layout, \"road course ringers\" are common, a NASCAR term standing for drivers that appear on the NASCAR circuit only for the road course races.\nMartin Truex Jr. is the defending winner of the event.\n\n\n== Race history ==\n\nFrom 1989 to 1997, 2019 and 2021, NASCAR uses the full 2.52 miles (4.06 km) road course, best known for sports car racing. Subtle changes to some of the turns accommodated the stock cars and increased passing widths. Ricky Rudd won the inaugural Cup race at Sonoma.\n\nThe 1991 Sonoma Cup race ended in a controversial fashion. With seven laps left in the race, Mark Martin tried to pass Tommy Kendall, subbing for an injured Kyle Petty. The two made contact, resulting in Martin crashing into the tire barrier on a pull-over site and Kendall cutting his tire. The lead went to Davey Allison. Then, with two laps left, pole-sitter Rudd passed Allison for the lead but Allison spun out from contact in the final turn. Rudd led to the white flag and was contending to win the race, his second Sonoma victory, and to advance his championship points to the lead. However, as he came around to take the win, Rudd was black-flagged just three feet from the finish line. Allison was declared the winner of the race with Rudd's controversial penalty while Rudd finished in second place.\nThe last Sonoma NASCAR race held at the previous road course passage was in 1997 on October 5 at a Truck Series event. There, Joe Ruttman won the race but controversy erupted when Rich Bickle blamed a loss of a top-ten finish on rookie Boris Said. Bickle cut down Said's tire and in reply Said waited for Bickle to come back around and crashed him. NASCAR, after a brief red flag for a massive crash in a wall of tires, disqualified Said and fined him $10,000 for his actions.\nIn 1998, the circuit for the NASCAR event was shorted from the full road course to a 1.95 miles (3.14 km) modified road course with the addition of the Chute from turn 4 to turn 7, bypassing turns 5 and 6.\nIn 2001 the Chute was modified to such that the NASCAR circuit measured 1.99 miles (3.20 km) long.\nThe 2014 running of the race, the final event from Sonoma broadcast on TNT, was dedicated to NASCAR designer Ray Fox, as mentioned in a moment of silence dedicated to his memory, as well as in the opening invocation.\nIn 2019, the race returned to the full 2.52 miles (4.06 km) road course layout to commemorate its 50th anniversary. This marked the return of the Carousel section after a 22-year hiatus.\nThe 2020 race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022, the race was reverted to racing the club configuration.\n\n\n== Gilligan's Island ==\nFrom 1989 to 2001, the pit road could only accommodate 34 pit stalls. In the early years, some teams were required to share pit stalls while other teams were forced to pit inside the garage area. When cars dropped out of the race, their pit stalls were reassigned to cars who were sharing.\nBefore the 1994 race, a makeshift auxiliary pit road was constructed inside the hairpin (turn 11) nicknamed Gilligan's Island. Cars that had the nine slowest qualifying speeds were relegated to these pit stalls. Pitting in this area was considered an inconvenience and a competitive disadvantage, more so than even the disadvantages one would experience pitting on the backstretch on a short track at the time.\nSince the length of the auxiliary pit road was significantly shorter than the main pit road, the cars that pitted there were held from 15 to 20 seconds to make up for the time that would have been spent if the cars had traveled the entire main pit road.\nPitting on Gilligan's Island had several other inconveniences. The location (the staging area for drag races) was landlocked by the racecourse, and crew members were unable to leave once the race began. Teams sent only the primary pit crew to Gilligan's Island, and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters to collect spare parts/tools. The only repairs that could be made were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as only minor repairs. Other auxiliary pit crew members, who were not part of the main crew, were staged in the garage area and would have to service the car if it required major repairs. If a team pitting on Gilligan's Island dropped out of the race, the crew was unable to pack up their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.\nChanges to the track in 2002 that included a separation of the drag strip from the front stretch, removal of the main drag strip grandstand, and the new control tower for road racing led to the pit road being expanded by extending pit road into the main straight and moving the pit exit up the hill past Turn 1, thereby expanding it to 43 cars, and Gilligan's Island was abandoned.\n\n\n== Trophy ==\nThe trophy is in the form of a wine bottle holder paired with a giant wine glass as a nod to the Sonoma County wine industry.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n2008, 2009, 2012, and 2021: Race extended due to a NASCAR Overtime finish.\n2020: Race canceled and moved to Charlotte due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Multiple winners (drivers) ===\n\n\n=== Multiple winners (teams) ===\n\n\n=== Manufacturer wins ===\n\n\n=== USAC stock car NorCal 200 ===\n1970 Roger McCluskey\n\n\n== Race summaries ==\n1989: Ricky Rudd won the inaugural race under King Racing which proved to be his only victory of 1989.\n1990: Rusty Wallace in his new No. 27 car won the race at Sonoma after Mark Martin got loose with 3 laps left.\n1991: After Mark Martin and Tommy Kendall clashed, Davey Allison took the lead in a huge margin against Ricky Rudd. Ricky Rudd nonetheless caught up and in the final turn with 2 laps left, he spun Allison around. Allison contended second after turning a 180 to hold on to the second spot. Ricky Rudd led the final lap and in the final turn, he waved to his pit crew and gave the victory fist but was instead shown a black-flag at the last second. His furious pit crew retorted to NASCAR that it was plain racing but nonetheless Rudd was disqualified from his victory and put in second place behind the eventual winner Davey Allison.\n1992: Ernie Irvan, who was black-flagged and given a stop-and-go penalty after the start of the race for jumping the start, wowed the fans by pulling up to the lead in the final laps to hold off Terry Labonte for the victory. The race was also notable for having been held just hours after the death of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr.\n1993: Ernie Irvan dominated but in the final 3 laps he was passed by NASCAR veteran and popular driver, Geoffrey Bodine who held him off to win the race. This would be the last victory for the Bud Moore Engineering team and one of the last races for Bodine driving for the team before becoming a driver-owner after purchasing the assets of what had been Alan Kulwicki's team following the defending Winston Cup champions' death in an April 1, 1993 plane crash.\n1994: Ernie Irvan dominated again and went on to win his second victory at Sonoma.\n1995: Dale Earnhardt dominated the race and held off a close friend and rival Mark Martin to take the victory. This victory at Sonoma put Earnhardt in the lead of the championship standings which gave him popularity at Sonoma. It was Earnhardt's much sought after, first-ever (and only), Cup Series win on a road course.\n1996: Again Mark Martin dominated but suffered heartbreak to fierce rival Rusty Wallace when Wallace passed Martin on a final restart to win the race.\n1997: Mark Martin dominated and won the race after Jeff Gordon got loose in the final 5 laps.\n1998: Jeff Gordon started on the front row, dominated nearly the entire race, and won his first Sonoma victory.\n1999: Jeff Gordon again started on the front row and won after domination.\n2000: Jeff Gordon started in 5th place which caused the fans to think his hopes of victory would not work. However, Gordon rushed up to the top spot on a first restart and dominated to win the race for a third consecutive time.\n2001: This race was one of the first races in NASCAR where road course aces were among the Cup drivers who were serious threats to win. Jeff Gordon won the pole and led the early portions of the race. After pitting, Canadian road ringer Ron Fellows led the most laps of the race, leading over 20 laps. However, Fellows lost his shot at the win through an untimely yellow with less than 57 laps to go. The final 30 laps found one-off road course ringer Robby Gordon (The two Gordons are not related) dominating. Robby Gordon had been fired from his team in spring 2001 and was racing only on rare occasions. Robby Gordon hoped to win in order to find a new ride. After Gordon spent too much time battling a lapped Kevin Harvick to keep Harvick a lap down, Tony Stewart got by Robby Gordon for the lead and stole away the victory.\n2002: Jeff Gordon dominated, but under a final caution he pitted and Jerry Nadeau took the lead by not pitting with 19 laps to go. Nadeau led 22 laps driving for Petty Enterprises. With 2 laps to go his car engine blew and he stalled in a pullover-site to avoid causing a caution. Ricky Rudd crossed the finish line first and this time he got to keep his victory, and it was also his final Cup win of his career. Nadeau finished 34th after another near-miss in less than 9 months (Nadeau ran out of gas on the final lap of the 2001 NAPA 500 at Atlanta).\n2003: Robby Gordon ended Jeff Gordon's domination streak by dominating the race in his No. 31 team he had driven for since 2001. On lap 43, Robby Gordon and his RCR teammate Kevin Harvick got loose racing side-by-side which nearly gave the win away to Ron Fellows. Fellows controlled the race from then until an untimely caution at lap 72 and losing any shot at winning with a spin with less than 20 laps left. Coming to the caution on lap 72, Robby Gordon passed Kevin Harvick in turn 11, violating a non-written gentlemen agreement to not pass under yellow. Robby Gordon went on to win.\n2004: Jeff Gordon dominated again and won the race with help from his teammate/student driver Jimmie Johnson who had pushed him on a late restart. The win was overshadowed by an altercation between Tony Stewart and Brian Vickers. Tony Stewart had retaliated against Brian Vickers on lap 85 for prior contact and on pit road, Tony Stewart smacked Vickers. For his part, Tony Stewart was fined $50000 and put on probation for the rest of the year.\n2005: Tony Stewart showed his skills at Sonoma and held off Sonoma's favorite, Ricky Rudd to take his second Sonoma victory. Stewart later became the next person after Robby Gordon to win both road course races in one NSCS season. Road ringer Brian Simo drove in this race for Richard Childress Racing and recorded his only top-ten finish, finishing 10th.\n2006: Jeff Gordon again amazed the audience by dominating and winning his 5th Sonoma race. The biggest highlight was Terry Labonte finishing 3rd in a new single-car team-the No. 96 for Hall of Fame Racing.\n2007: Jamie McMurray won the pole position and Robby Gordon led the most laps. However, the final laps saw Jamie McMurray back on the lead. With 8 laps to go Jamie McMurray was passed by a bitter rival; the cup rookie Juan Pablo Montoya. The final 10 laps both McMurray and Montoya were in fuel mileage drama and RCR driver Kevin Harvick (The Daytona 500 winner of 2007) who had enough fuel to make it; was gaining on them. McMurray later ran out of gas, in turn, one with 3 laps to go and slowed down giving up second place and ending up 37th because he ran out of gas just past pit road. Montoya never gave up his lead and amazed the racing world by stretching off his fuel crisis to win the race. RCR finished an amazing 3 in a row with Harvick in second place, Jeff Burton in third, and Clint Bowyer in fourth place.\n2008: Kyle Busch started a road course sweep in 2008 by winning at Sonoma for his first road course victory. He later became the next person after Tony Stewart to sweep both road course races with a victory. Marcos Ambrose had his first NSCS start in this race and had contention to win but crashed with Elliott Sadler with 25 laps left. David Gilliland matched his best career finish, finishing second behind Busch.\n2009: Kasey Kahne dominated the race and held off Tony Stewart and Marcos Ambrose for his first road course victory in NASCAR.\n2010: Due to fuel concerns, leader Marcos Ambrose stopped in turn 1 during a late caution. He drove back to the lead but was discovered to have violated the rule of maintaining speed under caution causing him to be reset by NASCAR in 7th costing him a shot at his first Cup victory; he finished 6th. Jimmie Johnson nabbed the lead thanks to the debacle and scored his first career road course win. As a result of his loss, Ambrose announced his decision to leave JTG-Daughtery Racing after 2010 to race under the renamed Petty Enterprises; Richard Petty Motorsports. Boris Said had his first top-ten finish since 2007's Sonoma race, finishing 8th in the new Latitude 43 Motorsports car.\n2011: In one of the most action-filled races of the event, after a repeat of history from 2004; a vicious fight between Tony Stewart and Brian Vickers (in which Vickers' retaliation on Smoke saw the number 14 propped on the tire wall at the hairpin), Kurt Busch dominated and won his first road course victory leading 76 laps in total.\n2012: Clint Bowyer dominated the race and won his first road course victory and one of Michael Waltrip Racing's first biggest victories in their career. It was also the first victory on a road course for MWR. This victory and a few others in 2012 showed that Bowyer would be a contender for victory even though he left legendary RCR to an underrated MWR team. Phoenix Racing had its greatest NSCS finish since its first win in 2009 at Talladega, with Kurt Busch the defending race winner who ended up in third place for his first top-five of 2012's NASCAR season. Kurt almost got second but Tony slipped by Kurt on the final lap for the second place his first top-five since his 2011 fall Dover win.\n\n2013: Marcos Ambrose led the first quarter against pole-sitter Jamie McMurray. After pit stops and penalties for other drivers, Martin Truex Jr. went upfront. Eventually, the lead was traded with Juan Pablo Montoya, among other drivers. With 22 laps left, Martin Truex Jr. went back up front and held off Jeff Gordon to win his second NSCS win and his first since Dover in 2007. While Truex celebrated an emotional victory MWR got two in a row owner wins at Sonoma, and Kurt Busch was praised by the drivers for recovering from two speeding penalties to finish in the top five. Drivers such as Ron Fellows, Boris Said, and Jacques Villeneuve returned to NASCAR to race at Sonoma.\n2014: A. J. Allmendinger led the most laps of 35 and appeared to probably have a sure victory in his hand. He was driving the No. 47 car which nearly won the 2010 race. However, he got tapped from behind by Dale Earnhardt Jr. which put him out of chances of a win. Carl Edwards ended up going on to win the race against Jeff Gordon who finished second for the second consecutive time. Boris Said and Tomy Drissi were the only road ringers who raced in this event.\n2015: The race was aired on FS1 for the first time after eight years on TNT, A. J. Allmendinger won the pole. Kurt Busch and Jimmie Johnson both dominated the race. With 5 laps to go, Kyle Busch, driving while recovering from a broken leg from the Xfinity series event at Daytona, drove past Johnson and pulled away from brother Kurt. Kurt was unable to close the gap and Kyle won, the first 1–2 finish for the Busch brothers. Boris Said was the only road course ringer in the event.\n2016: Carl Edwards put his car on pole and led the early laps. Allmendinger, who started second, ran up front for most of the first 40 laps, leading 20 of the first 40 laps. However, a pit road penalty for an uncontrolled tire cost Allmendinger his shot at victory. Denny Hamlin led the midpoint of the race while Tony Stewart anticipated a caution and pitted with less than 30 laps to go. Tony's pit stop paid off as the caution came out just after he pitted and he went up front to lead the final 20 laps and hold off a hard-charging Hamlin for the win, ending a 3-year winless streak. The only road course ringer in the race was semi-retired Patrick Carpentier who was driving the #32 Can-Am car. It would be one of the most popular wins of 2016 as it was Stewart's final year of NASCAR competition as a driver, as it became his 49th and final win.\n2017: For the first time since 2014, the field involved multiple road course ringers such as Billy Johnson, Kevin O'Connell, Alon Day, Tommy Regan, Boris Said, and Josh Bilicki, although they were not serious threats to win. The race was primarily a duel between guys such as Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick, Brad Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch, and Denny Hamlin, with Truex leading the most laps. After Truex's engine blew up on lap 86 while leading the race, the lead went to Kevin Harvick who led the final 22 laps to win the race over teammate Clint Bowyer.\n2018: Martin Truex Jr. and Kevin Harvick were the dominant cars. Kyle Larson won the pole but Harvick and Truex were the class of the field. Truex went on to win the race for his 2nd Sonoma victory, in a mostly caution-free race. Tomy Drissi and Justin Marks were the only road course ringers in the race.\n2019: Truex defended his 2018 win in NASCAR's return to running the full-length course, holding off Kyle Busch for the win. This was the first Sonoma race since 1995 that there were no \"road course specialists\" in the race. Matt DiBenedetto picked up his career-best finish in this race.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSonoma Raceway race results at Racing-Reference",

It is native to the low evergreen forests of Hong Kong.\n\n\n== History ==\nAilanthus fordii was first discovered in Cape D'Aguilar between the years 1884 and 1886.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAilanthus fordii is a dioecious, evergreen tree that can grow up to 5 metres (16 ft) tall. The branchlets are grey-brown and are densely puberulent. Odd, pinnately compound leaves are gathered at the upmost part of the branches and are 40-60 centimeters long. The petiole is 0.7–1.3 cm (0.3–0.5 in) long, and there are 13-27 leaflets, mostly opposite. The leaflets are oblong-ovate, and are 7–13 centimetres (2.8–5.1 in) long 4–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in) wide. The buds are inflorescence terminal, paniculate, and are 20-40 centimeters long. The flowers can be unisexual or polygamous, and they are calyx-cup shaped. Petals are about 2–3 millimetres (0.079–0.118 in). In female flowers, the anthers are imperfectly developed.\nThe samara is 3–5 centimetres (1.2–2.0 in) long and 1–1.8 cm (0.4–0.7 in) wide. The flowering period is October to November, and the fruiting period is December to April the following year.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Josiah Gillie, known professionally as J.P. or Jody P, is an American rapper and singer. He released his debut single \"Juicey Ahh\" in 2022 and his breakout single \"Bad Bitty\" went viral on TikTok in 2024.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJosiah Gillie was born in Milwaukee to parents Ramona Gillie and Antoine Buchanan. He has one brother, who, as of 2024, works as his manager. As a child, Gillie performed in musicals and sang jazz, opera, and in his church choir; he also played basketball and joined an Amateur Athletic Union team in eighth grade. He attended West Allis Central High School. He began making music in high school, which he described as \"horrible quality\". As of 2024, Gillie is attending the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point as a music performance major with a focus on vocal performance and a minor in communications. He also plays as a power forward for the school's basketball team, the Pointers.\nAs a freshman at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, Gillie's cousin encouraged him to try making lowend music, a style of hip hop music from Milwaukee. He recorded his first song, \"Juicey Ahhh\", on his phone using BandLab and a lowend beat from YouTube that was produced by Milwaukee producer DDMakinHits. He released it under the name J.P. in December 2022. The song soon went viral on TikTok after being posted by the popular Milwaukee-based TikTok account @414hypehousetiktok. After it was endorsed by rapper Lil Uzi Vert on social media in January 2023, a remix of \"Juicey Ahhh\" featuring Sada Baby was released. In 2023, J.P. released the song \"Get Down\" and his debut album, No Discounts. J.P.'s breakout single, \"Bad Bitty\", was released in February 2024. It went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms the following month due to the song's choreography and a meme involving the song's ad-libs. His song \"Freak Girl\" was released in April 2024.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nJ.P.'s music is primarily lowend, and he has described his music as a combination of lowend with R&B. He has named Otis Redding, Luther Vandross, and Sam Cooke as musical influences. He has stated that he does not write his music and that his lyrical process is \"more of a feeling-type thing\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJ.P. is bisexual. Social media rumors about him having had sex with another man circulated in 2024, which he confirmed during an Instagram Live video, stating, \"The same way you decide to crack a bad bitch, I made a decision to crack a [man].\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Claudius Ira \"Bud\" Vermilye Jr. (1928 – June 22, 2018) was an American defrocked Episcopal priest and child pornographer who operated the \"Boys' Farm\" in rural Franklin County, Tennessee, between 1971 and 1976.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nClaudius Vermilye was born in 1928 and raised in Bayside, Queens, New York City. He graduated from Bayside High School and attended the local All Saints Episcopal Church. During the Korean War, Vermilye served in the Air Force for four years as a staff sergeant at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. After the war, he moved to Tennessee and graduated from Tusculum University. Vermilye was ordained a priest in 1948 and served the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee.\nIn 1971, he opened the 1½-acre Boys' Farm of Roarks Cove in Alto, Tennessee, marketed as a rehabilitation center for homeless and wayward youths—a place where \"boys could learn self-respect and responsibility.\" Troubled adolescents were placed into his custody by courts, welfare agencies, and, in some cases, their parents. The Boys' Farm was not church-sponsored and was funded largely by its clientele.\n\n\n== Boys' Farm ==\nDuring his tenure as director of the Boys' Farm, Vermilye sexually abused his wards, aged 11 to 16, and photographed them engaging in sexual acts amongst each other. The photographs were developed in a darkroom located in his attic and were mailed to customers in and out of state, often with assistance from the boys. The children were also engaged in prostitution during overnight stays with customers.\nLaw enforcement became aware of illegal activities at the farm after his advertisements appeared in pornographic magazines, and from material found while investigating a New Orleans scoutmaster. During the execution of a search warrant at the farm, police discovered developed and undeveloped images of child pornography, as well as card catalogs containing the names of hundreds of current and previous financial contributors. Several of the sponsors would go on to testify against Vermilye at his trial in exchange for legal immunity in Tennessee.\nAccording to several boys who went on to testify, their homosexual activities were consensual, and none mentioned any use of force on Vermilye's part. One, however, said it was understood that the photography sessions were required if they wanted to continue living at the farm. Vermilye denied knowledge or responsibility for most of the photographs and said that he had shot a few of them for an artist and for \"sublimation counseling\" with his homosexual clients, whom he was trying to help stay closeted. He claimed the remaining photographs were placed on the farm by agents of an unspecified \"national child porn ring.\"\nIn addition to the crimes committed against his wards, Vermilye also used his son William for child pornography. William disappeared in the summer of 1974 and was never found.\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nFollowing Vermilye's November 1976 arrest, ex-ward David Forrister sued the state of Tennessee for $1 million, claiming that corrections officials placed him in a male prostitution ring and willfully neglected their duty to investigate the facility. Forrister's lawyer claimed that he and other boys who refused to cooperate were beaten and subjected to \"constant pressure to conform.\"\nOn June 3, 1977, a jury of ten found Vermilye guilty. He was sentenced to five to ten years of imprisonment for crimes against nature and ten to fifteen years for aiding and abetting crimes against nature, totaling an effective sentence of 25 to 40 years in prison. In 1978, he was deposed from the priesthood while free on bond, pending a later failed appeal to the Supreme Court.\nIn 1984, Vermilye again sought retrial, claiming that his conviction and sentences were void due to a denial of his constitutional right to effective legal counsel. His request was denied by the Supreme Court in December 1987.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nVermilye died on June 22, 2018, in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, aged 89.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn David Norman\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "United States Senate elections in Colorado occur when voters in the U.S. state of Colorado select an individual to represent the state in the United States Senate in either of the state's two seats allotted by the Constitution. Regularly scheduled general elections occur on Election Day, coinciding with various other federal, statewide, and local races.\nEach state is allotted two U.S. Senators elected to staggered six-year terms, which were originally selected by the state legislature. The Senate is divided into three classes to stagger the terms of its members such that one-third of the Senate would be up for re-election every two years. Upon Colorado's admission to the Union in 1876, the state was assigned a Class 2 seat and a Class 3 seat, first elected in 1876. Since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, U.S. Senators are elected directly by the voters of each state. Special elections may be held to fill mid-term vacancies to elect an individual to serve the remainder of the unexpired term.\nThe list below contains results from all U.S. Senate elections held in Colorado after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, sorted by year. The next scheduled election for the Class 2 seat is in 2026, while the Class 3 seat will hold its next election in 2028.\n\n\n== List of recent elections ==\n\n\n=== Class 2 ===\n\nCounty results of Class 2 elections since 2002\n\n\n=== Class 3 ===\n\nCounty results of Class 3 elections since 2004\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United States senators from Colorado\nList of United States presidential elections in Colorado\nElections in Colorado\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElection Information, Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives\nElection and Voting Information, Federal Election Commission",

        "content": "Francesco (or Francis) Caracciolo (died 31 May 1316) was a Neapolitan nobleman, diplomat and theologian who was the chancellor of Notre-Dame and of the University of Paris from 1309 or 1310 until his death.\n\n\n== Life ==\nCaracciolo was born in the latter half of the 13th century, probably in Naples. His father, Ligorio, count of Pisciotta, belonged to a cadet branch of the Caracciolo family. After completing his studies at the University of Naples, he became a counsellor of King Charles II of Naples (r. 1285–1309). He was sent by Queen Mary as her ambassador to the Roman curia, but he soon abandoned a secular career for theology. Caracciolo obtained a Master of Arts degree before 1300, either at Naples or at the University of Paris. By 1307, he was studying theology at Paris and held a prebend at Rouen.\nThrough the intervention of Duke Robert of Calabria, the future King Robert the Wise, Caracciolo obtained half of a priestly prebend attached to Notre-Dame. In August 1308, Pope Clement V granted him a future full non-priestly prebend in Paris in lieu of his half-prebend. He acquired a further prebend at Beauvais. All of these prebends were a result of his rank and connections. They facilitated his theological studies and gave him a secure income for the rest of his life.\nIn 1309, he wrote to King Robert asking that his old teacher, Peter of Narnia, be permitted to come to Paris to teach. He lectured on the Sentences in the period 1309–1311, but was still only a Bachelor of Theology when he was named chancellor. This took place in 1309 or 1310, for he was certainly chancellor for the academic year 1310–1311. He finally incepted as a Doctor of Theology in 1311 or 1312.\nCaracciolo was the first foreign chancellor of the university and of Notre-Dame. He served as chancellor while continuing to teach. On 9 September 1311, in his first recorded act as chancellor, he approved the works of Ramon Lull, which had come under criticism. After the death of Cardinal Landolfo Brancaccio on 29 October 1312, King Robert conferred one of his abbeys on Caracciolo. He was seemingly ill by 1 March 1316, since he did not preside at the inception of Prosper of Reggio Emilia. He remained in Paris as chancellor until his death on 31 May 1316. On his deathbed he joined the Dominican Order.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAlthough Caracciolo was a very prominent theologian during his time at Paris, very few of his writings have survived. He was a defender of the Immaculate Conception and is usually cited by other as \"the Chancellor\" (Cancellarius).\nThere are several witnesses to Caracciolo's lectures on Book III of the Sentences. John of Saint-Germain's notes on the lectures are found in the manuscript Worcester, Cathedral Library, F 69 under the title Notabilia Cancellarii addita super tertium. In his commentary on the Sentences, Peter of Palude cites Caracciolo even more extensively while discussing Book III and once on Book I. An anonymous disciple of Palude's included similar quotations in his commentary, which is largely derivative of Palude's. It is found in the manuscript Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, Ripoll 77bis.\nReports also survive of Caracciolo's role as an opponent in the inception disputation of Thomas Wylton in late spring 1312. There is a report attached to the Notabilia Cancellarii in the Worcester manuscript and another in the notebook of Prosper of Reggio Emilia, now Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 1086. Prosper also records four questions from a disputation of Caracciolo's, probably that associated with his own inception.\nThe Vatican manuscript Borghese 171 contains one quodlibetal question by Caracciolo and a Quaestio de ydeis that may have been written by him but more probably by Thomas Wylton. Up to six quodlibetal disputations of which record survives, but the attribution of those in the Vatican manuscript Latin 932 to him is disputed.\nThere is a quire bound as part of the manuscript Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 15669 that was probably written by Caracciolo himself. The handwriting is small. It contains one partial and one complete draft of the letter to King Robert and a series of short texts probably composed by Caracciolo.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

He was educated at Haileybury and the Royal Naval College. He joined the Royal Marine Artillery in 1884, and came to Canada in 1887 and farmed there and in the United States.\nHe joined the Governor General's office in 1891 as a clerk and was appointed private secretary to Lord Minto in 1899. He continued in office under Lord Grey, the Duke of Connaught, the Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Byng of Vimy. He was appointed CMG in 1911 and CVO in 1916.\nHe was allegedly dismissed by William Lyon Mackenzie King on account of his suspected Conservative sympathies. He died in Ottawa in 1944.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tom Ongena (born 20 September 1975) is a German-born Belgian politician for the Open Vld and has served as chairman of the party since 2023.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOngena was born in Cologne, Germany in 1975 before moving to Belgium as a teenager. He obtained a law degree from the University of Antwerp and from 1998 to 2003 he worked as a researcher in international criminal law and criminal procedural law at the university. He was then a political director for Flemish minister Bart Somers and later an advisor to Minister of Asylum and Migration Maggie De Block in 2019.\nDuring the 2019 Belgian regional elections, he was elected in first place on the Open VLD's list to the Flemish Parliament for the Antwerp constituency and was delegated as a member of the Belgian Senate.\nIn July 2023, he was appointed as temporary chairman of the Open VLD party at the recommendation of Alexander De Croo after Egbert Lachaert resigned as chairman a few days earlier. A few months later in September, he was officially elected as leader of the party. The election was seen as controversial as the Open VLD's leadership process did not take place via a direct vote which had been how previous chairmen were elected where members could also cast their votes digitally or by letter, but via a vote that required physical presence at the Open VLD party congress and for which an amendment to the articles of association was approved at the same congress. According to critics, this restricted the party's membership democracy. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Tom Ongena at Wikimedia Commons",

He had previously played Super 12 rugby for the Blues and later spent a season with the Chiefs.\nKerr is now a schoolteacher in the Bay of Plenty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJames Kerr at ESPNscrum",

In his second season with the team in 2011, Voulany returned to give Tevragh-Zeina its second title in the same tournament, and scored one of the winning goals in the final also against his former team, ACS Ksar. In his third season with the team in 2012, Voulany returned to help his Tevragh-Zeina team win its first title as Mauritanian Premier League. After the 2014 season, Voulany became the top scorer in the Mauritanian league for three consecutive seasons, and Egyptian and Moroccan clubs began trying to sign him.

In his first match with the team in the league, he was able to score two goals to lead his team to a 2–0 victory against ASAC Concorde and obtain the first 3 points. At the end of the season, he won the Premier League title with them. The team also relied a lot on the player in the 2018 CAF Confederation Cup due to his goals that either won the team or saved it from losing in several matches in the tournament.\nVoulany also played professionally in the Iraqi Premier League. Where he moved to the Iraqi club Al-Talaba on September 25, 2019, and then on February 25, 2020, he moved to the Iraqi club Al-Minaa.

        "content": "Wilkiea angustifolia is a species of flowering plant in the family Monimiaceae, and is endemic to Queensland. It is a dioecious shrub with elliptic leaves, male and female flowers on separate plants, male flowers with 4 stamens, female flowers with 8 to 20 carpels, and the fruit a purple to black drupe.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWilkiea angustifolia is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of up to 6 m (20 ft). Its leaves are narrow to broadly elliptic, 70–210 mm (2.8–8.3 in) long and 20–90 mm (0.79–3.54 in) wide on a petiole 3–10 mm (0.12–0.39 in) long, the edges of the leaves wavy or serrated. Male and female flowers are borne on separate plants, male flowers in leaf axils in clusters of 3 to 5, each flower on a pedicel about 10 mm (0.39 in) long with 4 stamens in 2 pairs. Female flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils, 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long, sometimes with 2 or 3, or on the ends of branches on a pedicel 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long with 1 or 2 carpels and 4 to 13 ovules. Flowering occurs from November to May and the fruit is a purple to black, oval drupe, 10–18 mm (0.39–0.71 in) long and 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1892 by Frederick Manson Bailey who gave in the name Mollinedia angustifolia, in the Botany Bulletin, Department of Agriculture, Queensland, from specimens collected on Mount Bellenden Ker \"at or about 3,000 or 4,000 ft (910 or 1,220 m) elevation\". In 1911, Janet Russell Perkins transferred the species to Wilkiea as W. angustifolia in Adolf Engler's Das Pflanzenreich. The specific epithet (angustifolia) means \"narrow-leaved\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nWilkiea angustifolia grows in the understory of rainforest at altitudes between 100 and 1,585 m (328 and 5,200 ft) in north-east Queensland.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nThis specfies is listed as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\n\n\n== References ==",
