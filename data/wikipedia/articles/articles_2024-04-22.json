        "content": "Isidro Lloret Massaguer (1880–1922) was a Spanish footballer, referee, and a lawyer specializing in municipal law and the first director of the School of Local Administration of Catalonia of the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona, created in 1914. He was also a director of X Sporting Club and then president of the Catalan Football Federation between December 1906 and 1908.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nLloret was a member of RCD Espanyol until 1905 when the club had to suspend its activities due to a lack of players since most of them were university students who enrolled to study at universities outside Catalonia in the 1905–06 academic year. Like him, most of Espanyol's players joined X Sporting Club, such as Emilio Sampere, Ángel Ponz, and goalkeeper Pedro Gibert. In his first season at the club, Lloret played a few matches, including a Catalan championship fixture against FC Barcelona on 11 December 1904, which ended in a 0–1 loss; however, it was X who ended up winning the championship.\n\n\n== Presidency of the Catalan Football Federation ==\nLloret hung up his boots shortly after, but remained closely linked to X as the club's director. He then became president of the Association of Football Clubs at the end of 1906, which he dissolved the association to create the Catalan Football Federation, which he led until 1908. He was thus the person in charge of the transition between the Association of Football Clubs and the Catalan Football Federation. During his presidency, the Federation experienced confrontations with FC Barcelona, who accused its president Lloret of benefiting X during the Catalan championship in 1908. To put an end to the fights, Lloret, who was the protagonist of a controversy in which he was accused of favoring his team and who had received strong criticism from the sports press, resigned in 1908, being replaced by the then Barça player Juli Marial, who accepted the presidency of the Federation in October 1908.\nThree years later, on 22 January 1911, Lloret refereed a Catalan championship match between Barcelona and Català FC, which ended in a 1–3 loss to the latter.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn his professional life, Lloret was a lawyer who specialized in municipal law, and as such, he became a professor of municipal law. Additionally, he was an official of the City Council of Barcelona and as such, he participated in the drafting of the Statute of the Commonwealth of Catalonia in 1914. In the following year, he began organizing the Setmanes Municipals (Municipal Weeks). In 1914, he published two books about his line of work Publicà Dret municipal vigent and Dret orgànic municipal (Current Municipal Law and Municipal Organic Law).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bernardo Picornell Richier (31 December 1883 – 27 September 1970) was a Spanish swimmer and sports leader. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the amateur beginnings of swimming in Spain since he was the fundamental head behind the organization of its first championship in 1907, the foundation of its first club in 1907, the writer of its first chronicles, and the first president of the Spanish Swimming Federation, a position that he held for over four decades between 1922 and 1968. He was also the main driving force behind the organization of its first water polo match in Spain in 1908.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nBernat Picornell was born on 31 December 1883 in Marseille, as the son of a Mallorcan boat captain. As a young man, he participated in swimming championships in his hometown. He moved to Barcelona in 1905, at the age of 22, where he continued his interest in the world of sports, through which he met Manuel Solé, owner of the Gimnasio Solé, and together, in 1907, they organized the first swimming competition in Spain, which took the name of the Spanish Swimming Championship-Copa Solé. This initiative gave him the idea to found, in the same year, the first swimming club in the history of Spain, the Club Natació Barcelona, which was established on 10 November 1907 at the Gimnasio Solé, settling itself first in the Eastern Baths of Barceloneta and later in the Baths of Sant Sebastià. At the time, aquatic activities in Spain were presented only as a leisure sport, mostly with no competitiveness. However, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, this changed under the influence of Picornell and Solé, the former bringing the experience of having competed in swimming and water polo while the latter stood out in sports practice in a pioneering way, having previously used his gym to host the founding of the football club FC Barcelona in 1899.\nPicornell presided over Club Natació Barcelona in an alternative way between 1908 and 1931. Under his leadership, the club organized the first recorded water polo match in Spain, which was played in Catalonia on 12 July 1908 between two teams mostly made up of foreign residents in Barcelona, on the Barceloneta beach, and which was refereed by Picornell himself. In that same year, he organized the first Winter Championship, which from the second edition was called the Christmas Cup, and in 1909 the Easter Grand Prix, tournaments that are still held today. He also wrote the first chronicles of swimming in all of Spain in the columns of Mundo Deportivo.\nPicornell was well connected with the great world personalities of swimming and sports in general such as the Pierre de Coubertin, the creator of the modern Olympic Games, of whom he was a personal friend and with whom he shared his ideas about the amateur sport. He was president of the Barcelona Natació Club for many years, as well as of the Spanish Swimming Federation and the Bureau of the Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur. In 1920, Picornell intervened in the foundation of the Spanish Amateur Swimming Federation, which he chaired from 1932 to 1968, and promoted the attendance of Catalan swimmers at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. He also participated in the foundation of the Catalan Swimming Federation in 1921. He was a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee and since 1952, a member of the Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) and instituted the Picornell Challenge, which was awarded to the members of the Spanish 4 × 200 m free relay champion teams. He managed to have the 1970 European Aquatics Championships held in Barcelona, at the municipal swimming pools of Montjuïc, which had been named after Bernat Picornell. He died in Barcelona on 27 September 1970 shortly after finishing the European Swimming Championships.\nIn 1946, Picornell was named honorary president of the Catalan federation, from which he received the Extraordinary Medal for sporting merit in 1957. From the Delegación Nacional de Deportes, he received the Gold Medal for Sports Merit in 1957 and the Spanish State awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Order of Civil Merit (1958), and the French named him officer of the Royal Order of Sports Merit in 1959. In 1993 he became part of the honor list of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, as a Pioneer Contributor.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gannanoolithus (meaning \"Gannan stone egg\") is an oogenus of dinosaur eggs likely laid by a dromaeosaurid theropod. It contains a single oospecies, G. yingliangi, known from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lianhe Formation of Jiangxi Province, China.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe generic name, Gannanoolithus, combines \"Gannan\", an alternate name of Ganzhou City where the fossils were found, with the suffix \"‑oolithus\", meaning \"stone egg\". The specific name, yingliangi, honors the Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum, where the fossils are housed. The authors also used the binomial variation \"Ganzhouoolithus yingliangensis\" in a figure in their publication.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Gannanoolithus holotype specimen, YLSNHM 01579, consists of a clutch of eight eggs. Specimens CUGW EH067-1 (a single egg) and EH067-2 (a pair of eggs) were also referred to the oogenus. All of the known fossil eggs have been found in layers of the Lianhe Formation in the Shahe Industrial Zone of Ganzhou City in Jiangxi Province, China. The eggs are symmetrically elliptic, ranging in size from 120–133 millimetres (4.7–5.2 in) long. The eggshells are 0.56–0.65 millimetres (0.022–0.026 in) thick. Similar to the preserved eggshells of Deinonychus-like maniraptoran theropods, they demonstrate an angusticanaliculate pore system. The porosity of Gannanoolithus eggs is similar to that of extant crocodilians and galliforms, whose nests are typically covered.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nDue to similarities with North American fossil eggs, Gannanoolithus eggs were likely laid by a dromaeosaurid. Notably, the eggs are paired in the holotype clutch, which has been observed in some other ootaxa. This may indicate that the egg layer had paired functional oviducts, as has been suggested for troodontids and oviraptorosaurs.\n\n\n== Parataxonomy ==\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Wu et al. (2024) found Gannanoolithus to occupy an uncertain position in relation to other dinosaur ootaxa. They recovered it in a polytomy of other theropod eggs which is the sister taxon to oviraptorosaur eggs, most of which belong to the Elongatoolithidae. Their results are displayed in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kargil Air War was fought between India and Pakistan during the Kargil War from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere along the line of control. In India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (Hindi: विजय, lit. 'Victory'), which was the codename of the Indian military operation in the region. The Indian Air Force acted jointly with the Indian Army to flush out the Pakistan Army and paramilitary troops from vacated Indian positions along the line of control, in what was designated as Operation Safed Sagar (ऑपरेशन सफेद सागर, lit. 'White Sea').\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe conflict was triggered by the infiltration of Pakistani troops—disguised as Kashmiri militants—into strategic positions on the Indian side of the line of control which serves as the de facto border between the two countries in the disputed region of Kashmir. During its initial stages, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed the involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid.\n\n\n== Indian operations ==\n\n\n=== First bombing campaign ===\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF) had been carrying out routine Electronic intelligence (ELINT), photo and Aerial reconnaissance since early May in such weather. On May 21, a Canberra PR57 from 106 Squadron on a reconnaissance mission, flown by Sqn Ldr A Perumal and Sqn Ldr UK Jha, was hit by a Chinese-made Anza infrared surface-to-air missile. The plane returned to the nearest IAF base, Srinagar, on one engine, and the crew landed safely. The Indian Govt, intent on not provoking escalation, cleared limited use of offensive and defensive Air Power only on May 25, restricted entirely to the Indian side of the Line of Control. There was no opposition at all by the Pakistani Air Force, leaving the IAF free to carry out its attacks with impunity.\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF) flew its first air support missions on 26 May, operating from the Indian airfields of Srinagar, Awantipora and Adampur. Ground attack aircraft MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars and helicopter gunships struck insurgent positions. The Mirage 2000 fleet was inducted on 30 May. Although the MiG-21 is built mainly for air interception with a secondary role of ground attack, it is capable of operating in restricted spaces, albeit with limited influence, which was of importance in the Kargil terrain.\nThe initial strikes had the Air Defence versions of the MiG-21s and (later) MiG-29s providing fighter cover. Mil Mi-17 gunships were also deployed in the Tololing sector. Srinagar Airport was at this time closed to civilian air-traffic and dedicated to the Indian Air Force.\n\n\n=== Second bombing campaign ===\nStarting May 30, the LGB capable Mirage 2000, which was deemed the best aircraft in the IAF inventory capable of optimum performance under the conditions of high-altitude seen in the zone of conflict, was used extensively. Armed initially with 250 kg \"dumb\" bombs, No. 7 Squadron led by Wg Cdr Sandeep Chabra, struck over three days infiltrator positions in Muntho Dhalo, Tiger Hill and Point 4388 in the Drass Sector. The receding snowline in June laid bare the hitherto camouflaged Pakistani positions, opening them up to non-stop day and night attacks by the Mirage 2000 and, subsequently, all aircraft.\n\nThrough the last weeks of June, the Mirages, armed with LGBs as well as with \"dumbs\", repeatedly struck the heavily defended Tiger Hill. Only 9 LGBs were used in this war, 8 by the Mirage and one by a Jaguar, as the dumb bombs proved highly effective. The first of the LGB missions on June 24 were observed by the (then) Chief of Air Staff, ACM AY Tipnis. All LGBs were delivered by two-seaters, with the rear-seat pilot doubling up as a WSO.\nThe Mirage 2000 proved its worth in this war. Such was its accuracy with dumb bombs that an LGB-equipped two-seater would join up as the tail of a 2 or 4-ship formation of other Mirages carrying between 6-12 dumb bombs each, film their attacks, and only if the results were less than optimal, or if it had spotted a Command and Control bunker on its Litening sensor / camera, let loose its LGB. The IAF therefore used the LGB selectively.\nAll aircraft operated at an altitude of 9–10,000 metres, (~30-33,000 feet above sea level), diving when required and pulling out well out of MANPADs range. The low number of airstrips for take off and landing of the flights also constrained the regularity and efficiency of the attacks. Despite this, there were hundreds of sorties on the intruders with no further material or personnel casualties enabling a gradual takeover of the mountain posts by Indian troops. According to the IAF, the \"air strikes against the Pakistani infiltrators, supply camps and other targets yielded rich dividends.\" \nAll remaining intruders were withdrawn and the operation was ended, being declared a success by the IAF in having achieved its primary objectives. However, there has also been criticism of the methods initially used and the type of planes being unsuitable to the terrain that resulted in early losses. This is believed by many in the Air force as coming as a wake up call to upgrade the ageing fleet of aircraft (especially the attack aircraft and helicopters) to better enable them to fight in the mountainous region. But, in the context of the war and in light of the poor information available on the infiltrations, the Indian Air Force was able to coordinate well with the Army and provide air support to the recapture of most of the posts before Pakistan decided to withdraw its remaining troops.\n\n\n== Pakistani operations ==\n\n\n=== 26 May Mig-27 shootdown ===\nFlt. Lt. Kambampati Nachiketa a Mikoyan MiG-27 pilot from No. 9 Squadron IAF (Wolfpack) who took part in a strike in the Batalik Sector on 26 May 1999. Armed with 80mm rockets and the aircraft's 30mm cannon, Nachiketa attacked an enemy position. During the operation, the aircraft took a hit from a Anza surface-to-air missile of the Pakistan Army's Air Defence Corps;, and Nachiketa was forced to eject. After ejecting, Nachiketa evaded immediate capture but after two to three hours, a Pakistani army patrol captured him. Nachiketa continued to fire his service pistol until he ran out of bullets. He was taken to a prison in Rawalpindi where he was beaten up by Pakistani soldiers until a senior officer intervened. Speaking to NDTV in 2016, Nachiketa said:\n\nThe jawans who had captured me were trying to manhandle me and maybe trying to kill me because, for them, I was just an enemy pilot who had fired on their locations from the air... Fortunately, the officer who came was very mature. He realised the situation that I am now a captive and now I need not be handled that way. So he was able to control them, which was a big effort because they were very aggressive at that stage.\n\n\n=== 27 May Mig-21 shootdown ===\nOn 27 May 1999, as part of \nOperation Safed Sagar during Kargil War, Sqn Ldr Ahuja was undertaking a photo reconnaissance mission. Another member of the mission, Flt Lt Nachiketa ejected from his MiG-27L after an engine flame out. Sqn Ldr Ahuja stayed over enemy positions to help the rescue attempts knowing full well the existence of enemy surface-to-air missiles in the area. However, his MiG-21MF fighter, C-1539, was hit by a shoulder-fired FIM-92 Stinger. Ahuja gave a radio call – \"Hercules, something has hit my plane, possibility of missile hit cannot be ruled out, I am ejecting over...(location).\". IAF authorities lost track of his aircraft and all communication shortly afterward.According to the data released by the Indian Air Force, Ahuja's aircraft had crossed the Line of Control, a ceasefire line and pseudo-border agreed upon by India and Pakistan in 1972 to maintain status quo in Kashmir. It is claimed by the Indian Air force that he was killed by Pakistani Soldiers after landing safely as his post-mortem report says that he had two fatal bullet injuries and fractured knee which was caused when he landed after ejection (shows that he was alive when landed). However, these claims were strictly rejected by Pakistan. Sqn Leader Ahuja's body would be recovered by the men of the 10th Battalion of the Garhwal Rifles.\n\n\n=== 28 May Mi-17 shootdown ===\nOn 28 May, a Mi-17 piloted by Squadron leader Rajiv Pundir was shot down- with the loss of all four of the crew- when it was hit by three Stinger missiles while on an offensive sortie in the Tololing sector. These losses forced the Indian Air Force to reassess its strategy. The helicopters were immediately withdrawn from offensive roles as a measure against the Man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS or MPADS) in possession of the infiltrators.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe lessons learned in this limited war influenced Indian Air Force to upgrade its combat fleet. It acquired and later started co-developing Sukhoi Su-30MKI heavy fighters with Russia beginning in the early 2000s. Development of HAL Tejas was also accelerated.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

        "content": "The Sweeper is a 1996 American action film produced and directed by Joseph Merhi, starring C. Thomas Howell, Ed Lauter, Kristen Dalton, Janet Gunn and Jeff Fahey. Howell plays a cop haunted by the early loss of his father (Fahey), whose unhinged behavior makes him a prime recruit for the vigilante unit assembled by a hardline LAPD veteran (Lauter).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nTeenager Mark is the son of police officer Trevor Goddard who, against the objections of his partner, allows his son to accompany him on patrol, as he wants him to one day join him on the force. During an altercation with some criminals loitering on a pier, one of the thugs recognizes the senior Goddard and warns him that word is out on the street that somebody wants him dead. Later at his house, contract killers barge in, looking to murder the entire family. Trevor and his wife are killed, and the leader of death squad hunts Mark down to the bathroom, where he taunts him, handing him a gun and daring him to avenge his parents. However, Mark can't muster the strength to pull the trigger and the gunman shoots him.\nMark is left for dead but survives and is nursed back to health thanks to the support of his grandmother and his crush Melissa. 15 years later, Mark is a grown man, and has indeed enrolled into the police to honor his father's wishes. However, he remains haunted by memories of his parents' violent death and is routinely castigated by his superiors for using excessive force, having been involved in the deaths of nine suspects. As a consequence of his obsession with police work, he is also estranged from Melissa, with whom he has had a son named Danny.\nFollowing his latest misconduct, which saw him beat a child molester after he had already been incapacitated, Mark drinks his problems away at a bar. He is picked up by a female patron who takes him home. There, it is revealed that the seduction was a ploy orchestrated by fellow officer Donald Molls. Molls introduces Goddard to Justice Incorporated, a secret police fellowship which uses extrajudicial methods to fight crime, and sees him as a potential candidate. Mark joins the group, enticed by the prospect of getting his revenge on the criminal underworld that destroyed his family, and by the charms of Molls' right-hand woman and top executioner, Rachel Gill.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in the Los Angeles metropolitan area during parts of July and August 1995. Although getting second billing, Jeff Fahey only makes a short appearance in the film's prologue as the hero's ill-fated father. He took the job as a favor to producer/director Joe Merhi, to whom he had been introduced by his agent, and with whom he was then in talks to produce an ensemble dramatic comedy written by his friend Robert Downey Sr. (which was eventually made without Fahey or Merhi's involvement as Hugo Pool)\nAccording to cinematographer and PM Entertainment regular Ken Blackey, the film marked yet another step up for the company, which aimed to stay current with the new intensity brought to Hollywood by directors such as John Woo. As such, the featured set pieces—all done without CGI—were more complex, such as the propane-fueled night chase and the climax featuring both a massive truck explosion and a mid-air plane fight. For these sequences, as many as nine different cameras were used. Roughly half would be mounted on or inside vehicles, while the other half would be small Eyemos protected by steel boxes and integrated into the decor to get close-ups of the destruction.\n\n\n== Release ==\nPM Entertainment released The Sweeper domestically on VHS on June 25, 1996.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Sweeper received mixed to negative reviews. TV Guide was broadly dismissive, writing: \"There is little to distinguish The Sweeper from the other action video product put out by [...] PM Entertainment Group. They generally include a bounty of drawn-out car chases, one gratuitous sex scene, and loads of gunplay. The Sweeper is no exception.\" The publication was also irked by Howell's \"brooding and petulant\" hero. Ballantine Books' Video Movie Guide was slightly more amenable, writing that \"C. Thomas Howell fares well in this derivative crime-thriller.\" Entertainment Weekly was moderately positive, writing that although C. Thomas Howell \"shrug[ged] through his role\", the film boasted \"a series of explosions-and-flying-bodies set pieces that are refreshingly old-fashioned given Hollywood’s current love affair with computer F/X.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly is a Malian politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mali between 2012 and 2013 and 2017 and 2018. Coulibaly also served as the Minister of State Domains and Land Affairs between 2013 and 2014, and the Minister of Defense between 2015 and 2016.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCoulibaly was born in Bamako, Mali, and graduated from Jean Monnet University and Stendhal University in France. He first entered politics at university, joining the Union of Communist Students while at Jean Monnet University. He then joined the Socialist Party of France, and supported Michel Rocard, along with forming the Malian Students of Saint-Etienne student association.\nWhen he returned to Mali, Coulibaly worked at a variety of Malian businesses including as the general administrator of European Handling Mali-sa and as the CEO of the Stellis telecommunications group based in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea. He became vice-president of the Union for Democracy and Development (UDD) in 2010. Following the 2012 Malian coup d'état, Coulibaly was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on August 21, 2012, serving in the role until 2013.\nAs foreign minister, Coulibaly expressed the need for stronger ties with Niger over counter-terrorism efforts in the early years of the Mali War, and claimed that \"conventional war is over\" in 2013. His first priority as foreign minister was the recapture of Azawad from the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). In his role as Minister of State Domains and Land Affairs which he held from 2013 to 2014, he received some support. Coulibaly also served as Minister of Defense between 2015 and 2016, but was sacked after a deadly jihadist attack in Boni. He returned as the Minister of Foreign Affairs again in 2017, but was sacked in favor of Kamissa Coumara in 2018.\nFollowing the 2021 Malian coup d'état, Coulibaly was forced to flee the country into Cote d'Ivoire and later France. He became an outspoken critic of the Malian junta led by Assimi Goïta, and has referred to him as a dictator. In August 2022, the junta released an international arrest warrant for Coulibaly and former colleagues of the Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta (IBK) administration for forgery and corruption.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTiéman Coulibaly sur RFI: «Le Niger et le Mali ont un destin commun» - May 24, 2013\nTiéman Hubert Coulibaly : « Assimi Goïta est un dictateur » - November 28, 2022\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The National Defense Brotherhood (護国同志会, Gokoku Doshikai) was a Japanese political organization formed on 11 March 1945, and dissolved on 15 August 1945. Although its chairman was Hiroya Ino, the group was actually conceived and led by Nobusuke Kishi.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAs Japan's outlook in World War II became increasingly bleak in 1944, Nobusuke Kishi, at that time a cabinet minister without portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō, came to be convinced that the war against the United States was unwinnable under Tōjō's policies. In July 1944, during the political crisis caused by the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Saipan, Tōjō attempted to save his government from collapse by reorganizing his cabinet. However, Kishi refused a request to resign, telling Tōjō he would only resign if the prime minister also resigned along with the entire cabinet, saying a partial reorganization was unacceptable. Kishi's actions succeeded in bringing down the Tōjō cabinet and led directly to Tōjō's replacement as prime minister with General Kuniaki Koiso, but also plunged Japanese politics into chaos.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nFollowing Tōjō's fall from power, Kishi moved quickly to reinvent himself as a key figure in the civilian \"Continue the War\" (Kōsenha) faction of the Diet. As part of this, Kishi ingratiated himself within prominent rightist communities such as the League of Patriotic Diet Members (Yūkoku Giin Dōshikai) and the ex-members of Seigō Nakano's Eastern Society (Tōhōkai). Kishi forged additional ties with extra-parliamentary sympathizers such as Rear Admiral Sōkichi Takagi, who prominently argued both for replacing the existing government, and a Decisive Battle (Kessen) against the Allies that would enable a settled, \"honourable\" peace. Most fruitful of these new connections however, was a close collaboration with the radical Pan-Asianist Takeyo Nakatani. As Kishi was now under continued surveillance by agents of the Special Higher Police (Tokkō), Nakatani functioned as Kishi's special emissary to other rightists both in the leadup to Tōjō's ouster and afterwards.\n\nKishi differed from Takagi's Kessen doctrine in that he rejected an expedient end to the war - believing instead that a prolonged war would allow for  the formation of a National Salvation Party (kyōryoku na kyūkoku seitō), that would articulate the \"political power of the masses.\" Working behind the scenes with ex-Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, Kishi worked towards this goal by advocating a military-led cabinet led under Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi. Kishi planned to reclaim his seat in the Diet by arranging the resignation of Yamaguchi representative Yoshimichi Kuboi and forcing a by-election, but these plans were frustrated by a targeted retribution campaign from remaining Tōjō allies in the army and government. Tokyo Military Police chief and close Tōjō ally Ryōji Shikata articulated this hostility at a drunken high society dinner by threatening to kill Kishi:\n\nI poisoned Ōtani Kubutsu, I killed Nakano Seigō, watch now I will kill Kishi\nKishi responded by temporarily withdrawing from frontline politics, resolving to work in the background towards creating a new political movement. In this atmosphere, Kishi held nightly meetings between January and March 1945 with several close associates at Tokyo's  Imperial Hotel. These meetings included figures such as Ryōichi Sasakawa, a preeminent fascist political fixer, Yoshio Kodama, a prominent rightist deeply involved in Japan's criminal underworld, Mamoru Shigemitsu, the then-foreign minister, and Ichirō Hatoyama, the future prime minister. From these meetings came a plan to form a new renovationist political movement aimed at mobilising the general public for a final confrontation with the Allies.\n\nRather than proposing a political party or any informal Diet faction, Kishi's vision resembled that of the early plans for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association put forward by Count Yoriyasu Arima and Fumio Gotō in the late 1930s. The aspect Kishi sought to revitalize was the creation of a nationwide network of vocational guilds, which would supersede the power of the National Diet and rally millions of potential civilians around military-directed national defense organizations.\nTo this end, Kishi enlisted the agrarian activist and political strongman Kōtarō Sengoku, and Dietman Naka Funada to help prod guild leaders towards enlisting some six million members into his new mass movement. When these outreach efforts stalled, Kishi extended an olive branch to the pro-army  Association of Imperial Rule Assistance Diet Members (Yokusō Giin Dōshikai). Kishi imagined riding on the popular support of the Agrarian Guilds and the Yokusō  all the way towards a serious bid for the Premiership. Kishi's plans coincided with the dissolution of the IRAPA in March 1945. Out of the IRAPA's disbandment emerged two political associations: the mainstream Greater Japan Political Association (Dai Nippon Seijikai) led by General Jirō Minami, and Kishi's anti-mainstream National Defense Brotherhood (Gokoku Dōshikai). Some 32 Diet members jumped ship to join Kishi's new association by the end of March.\n\n\n== Ideology and Activities ==\nThe Dōshikai established their central office in Tokyo's Marunouchi business district. Their location, alongside rumours that Kishi received vast sums of donations from industrialist Yoshisuke Aikawa, led to allegations that Kishi was soliciting kickbacks from Aikawa as a reward for Kishi's role in transferring the Nissan group to Manchukuo and establishing the half-Nissan owned Manchurian Industrial Development Company (Mangyō) in 1937. As the US stepped up its incendiary bombing campaign in 1945, the Dōshikai underwent several major structural and ideological changes in correspondence with the deteriorating situation of the war.\nThe structural changes were its administrative and policy shift from urban Tokyo to politics on the local village and hamlet level in Japan's rural hinterlands, and the founding in May 1945 of the Bōchō Association to Revere the Emperor and Expel the Foreigner (Bōchō Sonjō Dōshikai).\nThe shift from urban to local organization was prompted both by Kishi's shift towards active preparation for a National Defense Movement, as well as the diplacment of roughly 8.5 million civilians from Japan's major cities into the countryside throughout 1945. Kishi proposed extending the Dōshikai's reach into the countryside in order to create a new pro-army, militaristic coalition of agrarian youth groups, regional business guilds, and military reserve associations (zaigō gunjinkai). These calculations were almost entirely political. Kishi believed that whomever controlled the bulk of national mobilization associations officially linked to the imperial army would hold a decisive advantage over the power of the Japanese Home Ministry, an institution long-despised by Kishi for its political stranglehold over the politics and functions of the National Diet.\nThe Bōchō Association was founded by Kishi during his activities while in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Named after the Bōchō region of Yamaguchi, Kishi declared that the new movement would become a \"clean and bright\" mass movement, aimed at preparing the defense of the entire region, and for its individual citizens to \"discard both wealth and fame\" in order to lead a resistance to Anglo-American invasion in the so-called \"Birthplace of the Meiji Restoration.\" While making great efforts to avoid characterization of the Bōchō Association as a political club, Kishi enlisted the partnership of local elites, prefectural assemblymen, members of the House of Peers, and businessmen such as Kan Abe, paternal grandfather of Shinzo Abe. At a May 10 rally in Yamaguchi to \"Repulse the Demon\" (Kichiku Gekijō Kenmin Taikai), Kishi elaborated on his view of a decisive battle as the self-sacrifice of Japan's entire population in a 100-million strong  do-to-die corps (ichioku kotogotoku tokkōtai).\nIdeologically, the Dōshikai became evidently more radical, jingoistic, and grandiose in both its rhetoric and visions for the coming showdown with the Allied powers. To overcome the issues of Absenteeism and the aerial attacks on urban infrastructure which were crippling military production, members of the Dōshikai argued that a nation-wide mass conscription of civilians would create a martial class of \"productive soldiers\", who could be mobilized for work in factories, arsenals, and mines across Japan. Advocating a general evacuation of the populace and of industry from Japan's cities to the countryside, the Dōshikai couched their visions of the future in apocalyptic terms:\n\nAs we see it, all of the industrial cities will be destroyed by aerial bombing, and when that happens there will no option other than to relocate munitions production and foodstuffs to fortified strongholds in mountainous regions where the enemy does not usually bomb, and where they will not approach in the event of an invasion.\nThe hypothesized decisive battle (kessen) evolved from a purely military term to that of a foundational ideological tenant of the new \"War for Constructing Asia\" (Kōa-no-sen). As the war continued to deteriorate, Dōshikai members only increased their commitment to an imagined vision of Japan as a global Anti-Imperialist force. While lacking in details, the Dōshikai envisaged a united military front against the Allied powers, made up of anti-colonial nationalists and pro-collaborationist paramilitaries across the globe - all of whom would allow for new fronts for the decisive battle to be fought on and won:\n\nJapan’s fate is no longer its own. The independence and liberation of Asia and Africa depends on us.\n\n\n== Confrontation with the Government ==\nThe arrival of the Kantarō Suzuki cabinet in April 1945 was initially received warmly by Kishi and members of the Dōshikai, owing to the prominence of military and civilian renovationists in the cabinet. Quickly however, Kishi's mood towards Suzuki turned from approval to loathing, as Suzuki quickly expelled hardline renovationists from the government, heeding the retired Konoe's fears of a \"revolution of the left under the guise of the right\". Dōshikai members such as Nakatani viewed the Suzuki debacle as another missed opportunity, positing that had Kishi been dealt a fairer hand, the Dōshikai could have played a kingmaker role in the formation and structure of the Suzuki government. Figures on the political right, such as those in the Dōshikai, began referring to Suzuki's government as the \"Badoglio cabinet\", after the Italian General Pietro Badoglio, who in 1943 had arrested and toppled the government of Benito Mussolini, turning Italy away from the Axis alliance in the wake of Allied invasions. \nItching for a fight with the Government, the Dōshikai harangued Suzuki for a remark given on 9 June, as part of a speech to the House of Representatives on his personal view of the war. Suzuki spoke of a desire for peace in the Pacific, warning that \"the wrath of heaven [would] befall both countries\" if hostilities were allowed to persist. Interpreting the phrase as a direct attack on the imperial decision for war in 1941, Kodama Yoshio rose to speak on 11 June to attack Suzuki directly:\n\n“[The Japanese masses], convinced the divine spirit is always with them, rush forward joyfully into the fight without the slightest thought they will be punished by heaven...the premier must ensure citizens of this sacred country fight with undaunted determination of certain victory.\nAt the same time, a pamphlet from the Parliamentary Army Office, penned by Dōshikai member Tadataka Ikezaki, further denounced Suzuki's comments:\n\nThis villainous remark, which desecrates the sacred national polity and overthrows the glorious national faith, is such high treason even heavenly beings cannot forgive. Our comrades will pursue this lack of faith to eliminate defeatist and obscene people with the hope that one hundred million people will unflinchingly advance down the path to absolute victory.\n\n\n== Downfall ==\nThe Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet declaration of war on 6 and 9 August 1945 created a tense and uncertain atmosphere across Tokyo. As rumours that the government was preparing to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, various groups began planning a pre-emptive military uprising to halt the impending surrender. From 10 to 14 August 1945, the Dōshikai's Tokyo headquarters swarmed with numerous radical nationalists, parliamentarians and junior officers, all gathering informally to plan some form of resistance to the government. Lamenting their situation and the role they had played in bringing it about, Dōshikai leaders remarked:\n\nIf Tōjō had still been in power, he would have resisted until the very end...we would never have surrendered to the Anglo-Americans.\nWhile the Dōshikai acted as a key political mediator for the various conspiracy groups emerging in the capital, even their most optimistic members had begun reckoning with the gravity of Japan's situation. While positive that a Military Dictatorship would allow for Kishi's technocratic plans to adequately defend Japan against an Allied ground invasion, Dōshikai members conceded that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was totally lost under any circumstances, that the Japanese armies would immediately withdraw from the fighting in China, and that Manchukuo would ultimately have to be abandoned. Without any plan to deal with future Atomic strikes on the mainland other than proposing a general evacuation of the cities, members of the Dōshikai imagined no future for the Japanese Empire other than its holdings in Okinawa and \"Half of Korea.\"\nWhile no evidence exists claiming Kishi had any knowledge of the 14-15 December attempt on the Imperial House, the alignment of the Kyūjō officers and members of the Dōshikai on the conduct of the war suggests that he was, at the very minimum, sympathetic to their cause and unopposed to a military government. On the morning of 15 August, as the officers responsible for the failed insurrection committed suicide on the Nijubashi Bridge, the Kishi faction met in an undisclosed office close by and agreed to formally disband the Dōshikai, thus ending the \"Continue the War\" movement entirely.\nAccording to Levidis, the Dōshikai represented the culmination of Kishi's most radical impulses prior to his major political reorientation after the end of the war. At the same time, the actions and aspirations of the group also reflected Kishi's unrelenting political ambition in a time of total war and ruthless imperialism. Reflecting on Kishi and the Dōshikai in his 1974 memoirs, Nakatani wrote:\n\nPerhaps if Japan had not suffered the bitterness of defeat, the first Kishi cabinet might have been realized ten years earlier.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nLevidis, Andrew (2023). \"The War Is Not Over: Kishi Nobusuke and the National Defense Brotherhood, 1944–45\".

        "content": "The History of the Canton of Aargau is dedicated to Aargau in Switzerland, founded in 1803, and its various preceding territories.\nThe area was settled over 150,000 years ago, with the Helvetii being the first historically recorded inhabitants. The Romans ruled for just over 400 years until the beginning of the 4th century. Augusta Raurica and the legionary camp of Vindonissa were particularly important during that period. The remaining Gallo-Roman population was gradually assimilated by immigrating Alemanni. During the latter half of the 8th century, the region was referred to as Aargau, which was a Gau in the Frankish Empire. Some of the current cantonal territory was once part of the Frickgau, the Sisgau, and the Zürichgau.\nDuring the Middle Ages several noble families governed different areas in Aargau, such as the Lenzburgs, Kyburgs, and Zähringers. Among them, the Habsburgs became the most influential, eventually becoming one of the most powerful ruling dynasties in the Holy Roman Empire. While their base of power shifted to Austria towards the end of the 13th century, they lost their ancestral land of Aargau in 1415 when it was conquered by the Confederates.\nThe Confederates divided the territory among themselves. The largest part, the Bernese Aargau, was subject to the city of Bern, while smaller areas were given to the cities of Lucerne and Zurich. Two areas became common dominions under the joint administration of the places involved in the conquest: the County of Baden and the Freie Ämter. Only the Fricktal remained under Austrian control. The individual territories developed differently due to their ruling structures. The Reformation caused further division, being able to establish itself in Bernese Aargau and parts of the County of Baden.\nThe Canton of Aargau was created in 1798 as a result of the French invasion and the founding of the Helvetic Republic. At the time, it only comprised the western part. It was created at the same moment as the Canton of Baden and was followed by the Canton of Fricktal four years later. In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte decreed the merger of the three cantons to form the Canton of Aargau. Despite its internal divisions, the new state became a pioneer of liberalism and triggered several developments that contributed to the founding of the modern federal state in 1848. Aargau, now the fourth largest canton in Switzerland by population, is primarily known as an energy and transit hub and struggles to assert its independence between the centres of Basel, Bern and Zurich.\n\n\n== Prehistoric period ==\n\n\n=== Formation of the natural landscape ===\nThe canton of Aargau is divided by natural features. The northern part was shaped by the formation of the Jura Mountains, while the southern part on the Central Plateau was formed by glacial movements during the ice ages. The Riss Ice Age peaked approximately 140,000 years ago and covered most of the present-day canton, except for the western Fricktal valley around Rheinfelden and some Jura peaks that emerged from the ice.\nThe Würm Ice Age had a lasting impact on the landscape, although the glaciation was smaller than in other areas. Only the south-eastern part of the canton was covered by ice. The Reuss glacier and the Linth Glacier, which were at their largest around 20,000 years ago, left behind numerous erratic blocks that were displaced from the Alpine region to the plain. The previous range of these glaciers is still evident today in the terminal moraines located near Killwangen, Mellingen, Othmarsingen, Seon, Staffelbach, Würenlos and Zetzwil. The rocks left behind by the moraine at Seon created a dam that formed Lake Hallwil. At the end of the Ice Age, the lake was approximately twice its current size and gradually reduced to its present size over a few thousand years because of sedimentation. The glaciers in front of the valleys caused the rivers to deposit large amounts of gravel, creating significant aquifers.\n\n\n=== Stone Age ===\nThe oldest archaeological findings in Canton Aargau have all been made in the western part of the Fricktal, which has always remained ice-free. A 150,000-year-old hand axe was found near Zeiningen, and a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal stone axe was discovered near Stein. During the final stages of the Würm Ice Age, approximately 10,000 years ago, reindeer and wild horses were hunted. A resting place near Magden was used multiple times. After the glaciers retreated, the moraine and gravel areas were gradually reclaimed by vegetation, resulting in the development of a moorland landscape. This was later replaced by extensive forests. People settled along the rivers, lakes, and high terraces of the large valleys, engaging in hunting, fishing, and gathering.\nThe earliest evidence of sedentary farmers in Aargau dates back to the period between 4500 and 4200 BCE, in the area around Wettingen and Würenlos. A burial ground with 16 stone cist graves on the Goffersberg near Lenzburg dates from around 3500 BCE. Additionally, several lakeside settlements were established on Lake Hallwil during this time. Further settlements were located near Untersiggenthal, Mönthal, and Suhr. Archaeologists discovered graves dating back to around 2400 BCE near Sarmenstorf and Spreitenbach, which are also of significant archaeological importance.\n\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nThere are few findings from the transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age (2400 to 1800 BCE) in Aargau. One of the few findings is a double grave discovered near Zurzach in 1986. Between 1600 and 1200 BCE, the population increased and people started to move to higher altitudes for better protection, instead of living only in the river valleys and on the shores of Lake Hallwil. A fortified hilltop settlement on the Wittnauer Horn near Wittnau, inhabited for several centuries until the Latène period, is the best-known site from this period. Another settlement was located on the Chestenberg.\n\n\n=== Iron Age ===\nThe Iron Age started during the Hallstatt period around 750 BCE. Burial mounds, both large and small, from this period can be found mainly in Freiamt. The Reuss Valley served as a significant trade route from north to south during this time. The largest burial complex of this period discovered in Switzerland to date, consisting of no fewer than 63 burial mounds, is located near Unterlunkhofen. Other significant grave finds have been made in Reinach, Schupfart, Seon and Wohlen.\nAccording to Roman sources, the Helvetii migrated from southern Germany and settled on the Central Plateau in the 1st century BCE. The larger Helvetian settlements were located in Mellingen and Baden. Julius Caesar mentioned twelve fortified towns (oppida) in his work De bello Gallico, but it is uncertain whether the settlement on the Windisch plateau was one of them. The Raurici, another Celtic people, lived in the Basel region and Fricktal.\nOrgetorix led the Helvetii, who were frequently threatened by Germanic raids to the north, to abandon their settlements and move southwest to the lower reaches of the Garonne. However, in 58 BCE, Roman troops commanded by Julius Caesar stopped their advance at Bibracte. The Helvetii were forced to return, rebuild their villages and towns, and acknowledge Roman supremacy.\n\n\n== Roman rule ==\n\nA few years later, the Romans started colonising areas independently. Around 45 BC, they founded the town of Augusta Raurica (today Kaiseraugst) in the far north-west of today's canton of Aargau to secure an important transport route to Gaul. Initially, the settlement was concentrated west of the Violenbach stream in the canton of Basel-Landschaft and expanded onto Aargau soil around a hundred years later.\nSettlement in the area came to a standstill for around three decades after Caesar's assassination in 44 BC and the subsequent civil war. In about 15 BC, the Romans constructed a small military station on a plateau near the confluence of the Aare, Reuss, and Limmat rivers to secure the Augustan Alpine campaigns. This station was later expanded into the legionary camp of Vindonissa (now Windisch) in 14 CE. Additionally, two significant Roman roads intersected at this location. To supply the camp, farmsteads (villa rustica) were scattered throughout Aargau. The largest known ones were located near Möhlin, Oberentfelden, and Zofingen (see Villa rustica (Zofingen)).\nThere were also three vici (village settlements): Aquae Helveticae (now Baden), a few kilometres east of Vindonissa on the Limmat, dates from around the time the camp was founded. It was known far and wide for its hot springs and thermal baths, but was also an important settlement for craftsmen. Tenedo (now Bad Zurzach) was a roadside village on the Rhine, settled from the second quarter of the 1st century and used as a bridgehead for an important river crossing. The vicus Lindfeld near Lenzburg (name unknown at the time, probably Lentia) existed from the second quarter of the 1st century. A theatre with 4000 seats formed the centre of a religious complex.\nThe Legio XIII Gemina was stationed in the Vindonissa camp until 44, when it was replaced by the Legio XXI Rapax. In 69, the year of the Four Emperors, the Helvetian militia stationed in Tenedo supported Emperor Galba and ambushed a courier detachment. The legionaries that were allied with Vitellius carried out a punitive action under Caecina's command. They devastated and plundered estates and settlements in a wide radius around Vindonissa. Following his ascension to power, Vespasian ordered the transfer of the 21st legion to Lower Germania and the stationing of Legio XI Claudia in Vindonissa.\n\nIn 101 the military departed the camp, leaving behind a guard post of Legio VIII Augusta. Vindonissa was transformed into a civilian settlement, which included an amphitheatre with seating for 11,000 people. The second century was a relatively peaceful and uneventful period. Trade flourished, with raw materials and luxury goods imported from Italy, southern France and Spain in particular. Producers in Aargau exported a variety of foodstuffs, including grain, meat, honey and cheese, to Italy. Artisans were also plentiful. There were potteries and blacksmiths in Baden, Kaiseraugst, Windisch and Lenzburg, brickworks in Hunzenschwil, Kaisten and Kölliken and quarries in Mägenwil and Würenlos.\nThis period of prolonged peace came to an end in the 3rd century with the invasion of the Alemanni. Attempts to repel the Alemanni's initial incursions in 213 and 233 were initially successful. However, in 259, the Alemanni finally breached the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes and advanced through the Central Plateau, plundering and destroying. The Roman troops were compelled to retreat across the Alps and did not regain control of the area south of the Rhine until 277, which was now the northern border of the Roman Empire. The Battle of Vindonissa, in which the Romans were victorious over the Alemanni, is recorded for the year 298. In response to the threat posed by the Alemanni, numerous forts and watchtowers were constructed to defend the border. The Vindonissa legionary camp was also reoccupied. During the 4th century, the Alemanni repeatedly launched raids. To reinforce the border defences on the Rhine, the Romans extended them for the last time between 369 and 371. Between 401 and 406, the Romans withdrew across the Alps for good. The population, which had been depleted by the ravages of war, was forced to seek refuge in the fortified towns, where they became impoverished and the infrastructure fell into disrepair.\n\n\n== Early Middle Ages ==\n\n\n=== Settlement by the Alemanni ===\nAlmost a century after the Romans departed, the Alemanni commenced the process of settlement in the Aargau region. Initially, they aspired to relocate to western France, but in 497, following a military defeat, they were compelled to acknowledge the authority of the Franks and turn their attention to the south. Between 507 and 536, the southern portion of Aargau was under the control of the Ostrogoths until they were also expulsed by the Franks. By the middle of the 7th century, the Frankish dynasty of the Merovingians had lost considerable influence, and the Alemanni had established an independent duchy. In 746, the Alemanni were finally subjugated by the Carolingians, and the duchy was dissolved.\nThe endings of place names from the present day indicate approximately when the individual villages were founded. Villages with the ending \"ach\" (e.g. Mandach, Rüfenach, Zurzach) are of pre-Germanic origin and are derived from the Gallo-Roman word ending \"acum\". The Alemannic endings indicate three phases of settlement: in the 6th century, places with the ending \"ingen\" emerged. These settlements were typically named after the head of the family. Villmaringen (now Villmergen) is an example of this, meaning \"by the people of Villmar.\" From the late 6th to the 8th century, places with the endings \"ikon\" or \"iken\" emerged. These are shortened forms of \"inghofen\" and denote a farm. Dottikon, therefore, means \"by the farms of the men of Toto.\" Villages with the ending \"wil\" or \"schwil\" (e.g. Dättwil, Waltenschwil) emerged after the 8th century. This ending denotes a hamlet. Other endings such as \"büren\", \"dorf\", \"heim\", \"stetten\" or \"hausen\" appeared around the turn of the millennium.\nApart from numerous graves with grave goods, there are few archaeological traces, as the Alemanni constructed all their houses out of wood. However, their economic and social system characterised the lives of the inhabitants of the Aargau until well into the 19th century. Over time, their language developed into Swiss German.\n\n\n=== Aar-Gau ===\n\nFor administrative purposes, the Carolingians divided the empire into gaue, which were ruled by counts. The name Aar-Gau first appeared in 768 as \"pagus Aregaua\" and in 778 as \"pagus Aragougensis\". Aargau encompassed the area between the rivers Aare, Reuss, Mount Pilatus, Lake Brienz and Lake Thun. The territory only encompassed approximately half of the area that the canton occupies today.\nIn the Wasserschloss of Switzerland, located to the north of Windisch, three districts of the Frankish Empire met. Crossing the Aare marked the transition into the Augstgau. The Reuss formed the border with Thurgau, a fact reflected in the name of the municipality of Turgi, which still serves as a reminder of this border demarcation today. After the division of the empire in 843, the border between the Middle Kingdom and the Eastern Kingdom ran along the Aare. Following the dissolution of the Middle Kingdom in 870, the entire canton was incorporated into the Eastern Kingdom. Around 900, the Burgundians conquered Aargau.\n\nIn the 10th century, the district was reduced in size and divided into Unteraargau and Oberaargau. The north-western part of today's canton was in the Frickgau and partly in the Sisgau, while the part east of the Reuss was in the Zürichgau. In 1033, the entire territory of Switzerland fell to the Holy Roman Empire. It was not until the 14th century that the term Aargau began to be used to describe the remaining areas.\n\n\n=== Christianisation ===\nChristianity only spread very slowly in Aargau during Roman times. The first religious communities can only be traced back to the early 4th century. Saint Verena, who came from Thebes (Egypt), moved to what was then the Roman fort of Tenedo (Zurzach), where she healed the sick and supported the poor until her death in 344. Zurzach then developed into a place of pilgrimage. In 346, Augusta Raurica was named as the seat of a bishop (the seat of the diocese was subsequently moved to Basel in the 7th century). Vindonissa had also been the seat of a bishop in the 6th century, but was then replaced by the diocese of Constance. Initially, Christianity was only able to gain a foothold in the old Gallo-Roman fort centres, while the Alemannic immigrants remained largely pagan. Only the most elite members of the Alemanni initially permitted themselves to be Christianised, following the example of the Merovingians. The Christian faith only finally became established at the end of the 7th century.\n\n\n== High Middle Ages ==\n\n\n=== Nobility in Aargau ===\n\nIt is challenging to ascertain the precise age of the earliest castles. The history of Alt-Homberg Castle in Fricktal can be traced back to at least the 10th century. Lenzburg Castle, the largest and most significant castle complex in Aargau, was constructed in the early 11th century and first mentioned in a document in 1036. It was the ancestral seat of the Counts of Lenzburg, who exercised authority over the Seetal valley. A second centre of power was located around Baden with Stein Castle.\nThe Lenzburg family dynasty was extinguished in 1173. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa personally resolved the succession issue at Lenzburg Castle and bestowed the majority of the lands upon his son, Count palatine Otto of Burgundy. However, following his death in 1200, the Kyburgs were able to reclaim their right to succession and oust the Hohenstaufen family from Aargau. Following the extinction of the Zähringers in 1218, the Kyburgs became the most powerful noble family in Aargau. However, they too eventually died out in 1264.\nOther significant noble families with extensive land in Aargau included the Counts of Frohburg, the Barons of Regensberg and the Barons of Klingen. Additionally, there were numerous minor local noble families, of which the Hallwyls were the most prominent.\n\n\n=== Germ cell of the Habsburg Empire ===\n\nThe Kyburgs' principal rivals for dominance in the Alpine foothills were the Counts (later Dukes) of Habsburg. It is probable that they descended from a branch of the Etichonids in Alsace, and that they were able to acquire extensive territories there, as well as in Breisgau and Frickgau. In the 10th century, they settled in Altenburg near Brugg, and made the Eigenamt the centre of their activities. In the vicinity of Altenburg, Radbot constructed the \"Habichtsburg\" (subsequently known as Habsburg) in approximately 1020, establishing it as his new family seat. In 1108, Otto II, Radbot's grandson, was the first documented individual to be referred to as \"von Habsburg\".\nThe Habsburgs were able to gain control of the inheritance of other noble families by building skilful connections through marriage. This enabled them to expand their possessions. In 1223, they took over the inheritance of the Old-Hombergs and thus gained control of the strategically important Bözberg Pass. In 1232, the Habsburg-Laufenburg collateral line split off. However, the Laufenburgs only owned relatively insignificant territories around Laufenburg and in Obwalden. This line became impoverished and died out in 1386 with the sale of the last possessions to the main family line.\nDuring the reign of Rudolf I, the Habsburgs ascended to become a significant European power. The Kyburgs, who had inherited the Zähringen and Lenzburg dynasties, ceased to exist in 1264. The Habsburgs assumed control of their legacy and supplanted them as the preeminent territorial power in northern Switzerland. Following Rudolf's election as German king in 1273, the Habsburgs' influence shifted to Austria. Nevertheless, they continued to expand their holdings in their native lands. In 1291, the Alsatian prince-abbey of Murbach sold its sovereign rights over several villages in Aargau, the monastery of St Leodegar in Lucerne and numerous villages in central Switzerland for 2000 marks of silver.\nThe Confederates began to apply increasing pressure on the Habsburgs in their homelands. The Habsburg expansionist policy received its first setback in 1315 following the loss of the Battle of Morgarten. In 1351, troops from Zurich marched through the Ostaargau. They devastated Baden and Siggenthal and destroyed Freudenau Castle, the conflict culminating in the Battle of Dättwil. In 1375, the Gugler raided the Mittelland, inflicting relatively minor damage on Aargau in comparison to its western neighbours. However, the town of Lenzburg was razed to the ground for tactical reasons and rebuilt shortly afterwards. The defeat at the Battle of Sempach on 9 July 1386 severely weakened the Aargau nobility. In addition to Duke Leopold III, around 400 nobles allied to him were felled. The resulting power vacuum made it increasingly evident that the influence of the Habsburgs was shifting towards the east.\n\n\n=== Founding of towns and monasteries ===\nAround 1100 there was not a single town in Aargau. But this was followed by a wave of town foundations that reached its peak between 1230 and 1240, when no fewer than six towns were founded. The initiative came from nobles who wanted to strengthen their domain and create new sources of income.\n\nThe first town in Aargau was Rheinfelden, which was founded between 1130 and 1140 by the Zähringen dynasty. In the early 13th century, the Counts of Frohburg followed with the foundation of Zofingen. The first Habsburg towns were Brugg (after 1200) and Laufenburg (before 1207). Four Kyburg towns were founded within ten years: The towns of Baden and Mellingen were founded around 1230, while Aarau and Lenzburg were established around 1240. The Habsburg town of Bremgarten was also founded during this period, as was Klingnau. The exact date of foundation is only known for Klingnau: this town was founded on 26 December 1239 by the barons of Klingen. The Habsburg towns of Meienberg (after 1250) and Aarburg (after 1300), and Kaiserstuhl (approximately 1254), the only town founded by the Regensberg on Aargau territory, were the last to follow.\n\nSome places failed to develop further. The most notable example is Zurzach, which had an urban structure and, thanks to the Zurzach trade fair, was an important economic centre beyond the region. However, it was not granted a town charter as there were already three towns in the immediate vicinity that were under the control of the Bishop of Constance (Klingnau, Tiengen, Waldshut). Although Biberstein was fortified with a ring wall in 1399, it lacked both a market and town rights and was reduced to a village. Meienberg was destroyed by the Confederates after the Battle of Sempach in 1386 and has remained a small farming village to this day. Kaiserstuhl has only grown marginally since its foundation. No Aargau town has succeeded in building up a larger territory of its own. The reasons for this are threefold. Firstly, the foundation occurred relatively late in the history of the region. Secondly, the town was granted only limited rights. Thirdly, excessive power held by sovereigns.\nIn addition to nobles and cities, various monasteries also exercised secular power. For centuries, these were also centres of art and knowledge. Between the 11th and 14th centuries, thirteen monasteries and three canonries were founded on Aargau soil. The most significant abbeys were Muri (1027, Benedictines), Wettingen (1227, Cistercians) and Königsfelden (1309, Franciscans). Monasteries situated outside of the Aargau region also exerted considerable influence, in particular Saint Blaise and Säckingen, as well as the diocese of Constance. Additionally, the Order of Saint John (Biberstein, Leuggern, Rheinfelden) and the Teutonic Knights (Beuggen, Hitzkirch) possessed considerable landed estates.\n\n\n== Conquest of the Aargau ==\n\nThe underlying conflict between the German King Sigmund and the Austrian Duke Frederick IV reached a critical point at the Council of Constance in 1415. Frederick assisted one of the three popes at the time, John XXIII, in fleeing the city. Sigmund perceived this as an opportunity to inflict harm upon his adversary, calling upon the Habsburgs' neighbours to seize their lands in the name of the empire.\nThe Confederates were tasked with occupying Aargau at that time, despite having signed a peace treaty with Austria just three years prior. Bern demonstrated the least hesitation, immediately marching troops out. Zurich and the towns in central Switzerland initially hesitated due to the peace treaty, but ultimately set off to avoid leaving everything to the Bernese. Only Uri did not participate in the campaign.\nOn 18 April Zofingen was captured by the Bernese. Six days later, Aarau, Brugg, Lenzburg and Habsburg were also conquered, with minimal resistance. Lucerne besieged Sursee and subdued the Michelsamt and the offices of Meienberg and Richensee. Zurich occupied the Freiamt Affoltern and the Kelleramt. Following the capitulation of Mellingen, the Zurich troops joined forces with those of Lucerne, Glarus, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Zug. Together, they compelled the inhabitants of Bremgarten to surrender on 24 April. The inhabitants of the Villmergen area also voluntarily allied themselves with Lucerne.\n\nThe siege of Baden commenced on 25 April, during which the troops of the Austrian bailiff Burkart von Mansberg mounted a resistance. The defenders evacuated the town on 3 May and retreated to Stein Castle. On 9 May, the Bernese, who were already on their way back, were requested to assist in a siege on the castle. On 11 May, von Mansberg signed a truce. Following the surrender of the defenders on 18 May, the castle was immediately razed to the ground.\nDuring the campaign Duke Frederick reconciled with King Sigmund, who demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and the return of the territories that had been conquered. Only the Confederates did not comply. By acquiring the lien over the Bailiwick of Baden and the towns of Baden, Mellingen, Bremgarten and Sursee on 22 July, Zurich was able to find a formal legal solution to this problem. On 18 December 1415, Zurich incorporated the five towns of Lucerne, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug and Glarus into the pledge. This was followed by the incorporation of Bern on 1 May 1418. The Habsburg house archives, which had been located in Stein Castle, were transferred to Lucerne and only returned to the Habsburgs in 1474. In the same year, the Habsburgs finally renounced all territorial claims with the \"Perpetual Acoord\".\nWith the conquest of the Aargau, the Confederates assumed de facto sovereignty. As they had not reached an agreement before the campaign, they disagreed for more than ten years on the division of the conquered territories. Bern finally prevailed and was permitted to retain all the territories it had conquered in Unteraargau (the so-called Bernese Aargau). Zurich was awarded the Kelleramt and the Freiamt Affoltern, while Lucerne was granted the Michelsamt. Nevertheless, Lucerne was obliged to return the offices of Richensee and Meienberg, as well as the area around Villmergen, to the common property in 1425.\nThe Confederates established two common dominions, the Freie Ämter and the County of Baden, from the common property, a strip of territory averaging 15 kilometres in width. The initial impact of the conquest on the inhabitants of the Aargau was minimal. The Confederates merely assumed the sovereign rights that had previously belonged to the Habsburgs. In some villages, the change in authority only affected the higher jurisdiction, while the lower jurisdiction was initially retained by the towns, local nobles, or monasteries.\n\n\n== Development in the individual dominions ==\n\n\n=== Unteraargau ===\n\nThe territorial situation in Bernese Aargau underwent a fundamental transformation. The Bernese succeeded in acquiring new territories in the Jura and securing the Bözberg and Staffelegg passes. In 1460, they conquered the lordship of Schenkenberg, and during the Waldshut War in 1468, they gained the lordship of Wessenberg, which included the villages of Hottwil and Mandach. In 1499, the lordship of Biberstein was occupied during the Swabian War. In 1502, the lower court of Urgiz with the village of Densbüren was purchased. The expansionist policies of the Bernese reached their conclusion with the purchase of the lordship of Bötzberg (comprising Bözen, Effingen and Elfingen) in 1514.\n\nOver more than three centuries, the Bernese succeeded in almost completely buying up or usurping the manorial rights of local rulers. By the 18th century, the influence of the nobility had fallen to a minimum. Bernese Aargau gradually developed into a state with a modern character. Initially, the region was administered by a single bailiff from Aarburg. Subsequently, the bailiwicks of Lenzburg (1442), Schenkenberg (1460), Biberstein (1499), Königsfelden (1528) and Kasteln (1732) were incorporated. The four \"municipal towns\" of Aarau, Brugg, Lenzburg and Zofingen were granted the right of self-administration and their own jurisdiction. The tight administration facilitated economic development, with Bernese Aargau becoming the most industrialised region in Switzerland by the beginning of the 18th century.\nThe Old Zurich War also had an impact on Bernese Aargau. On 30 July 1444, Brugg was plundered and burned down by Habsburg nobles in the so-called \"Brugg Night of Murder\". In February 1499, during the Swabian War, an Austrian army marauded through the Schenkenberg district. They were supported by peasants from the Mettauertal. In response, the Bernese, in conjunction with the inhabitants of Fribourg, devastated the settlements situated to the north of the Staffelegg, extending as far as Frick.\n\n\n=== Freie Ämter ===\n\nThe Freie Ämter constituted a common lordship and comprised the former Habsburg administrative districts of Meienberg, Muri and Richensee, as well as the north-eastern part of the district of Lenzburg. The six ruling places of Glarus, Lucerne, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug and Zurich alternated in occupying the influential office of bailiff for two years. The bailiff did not have a fixed residence; rather, they only appeared three times a year to deal with serious court cases and collect taxes. From 1532 (one year after the victory of the Catholic towns in the Second Kappel War), Uri also appointed bailiffs. The Kelleramt south-east of Bremgarten was conquered by Zurich, which, however, only took over the high jurisdiction, while the lower jurisdiction remained in the possession of the town of Bremgarten.\n\nThe jurisdictions within the court system and the lordships were highly fragmented. The most significant landowner, the largest economic factor, and the holder of the lowest jurisdiction in the majority of locations was Muri Abbey. This Benedictine abbey was regarded as the richest monastery in Switzerland at the end of the 17th century. Other lords of court and landlords included Hermetschwil Abbey, the towns of Bremgarten, Mellingen, Lucerne and Zug, as well as individual local nobles. Merenschwand had been under the jurisdiction of Lucerne since 1394 and was not part of the Freie Ämter.\nAs the rulers changed every two years, the administration was less developed than in Bernese Aargau, for example, and the subjects could permit themselves more than elsewhere and were rarely called up for military service. The ruling places were mostly only interested in tax revenues and otherwise cared little about the area. From 1562, a land registrar residing in Bremgarten took care of the few administrative tasks. However, the loose control also had its disadvantages: Freiamt served as a gathering place for beggars and vagrants from across the Confederation. The economy remained underdeveloped due to a lack of investment security. The pivotal battle of the Swiss Peasant War occurred in Wohlenschwil, in the far northwest of the Freie Ämter, on 3 June 1653. Here, the rebellious peasants from the Bernese and Lucerne subject territories were defeated by the troops from Zurich.\n\n\n=== County of Baden ===\n\nThe County of Baden was a common lordship that was administered by all seven places that had been involved in the campaign of 1415. From 1443, Uri was also included in the administration. Each village provided a bailiff for two years, who resided in the Baden bailiff's castle. It was only in individual villages that the bailiff exercised the financially lucrative lower jurisdiction, which meant that the County of Baden was initially a loss-making business for the Confederation. The Wettingen and Saint Blaise monasteries, the In commendam of the Knight Hospitaller in Leuggern and the Bishopric of Constance were important court and landlords. The towns of Baden, Bremgarten and Mellingen were largely autonomous and only belonged to the County of Baden for administrative purposes.\nOver the centuries the Confederate bailiffs were able to gradually usurp the rights of the secular and ecclesiastical lords. However, developments occurred more rapidly in the villages of the eastern Limmat Valley, where Zurich was able to exercise almost unrestricted powers, provided the lords of the court and recruited troops. Today, all of these municipalities belong to the canton of Zurich, and Altstetten is even a district of Zurich.\n\nThe administration of the territories that had been jointly conquered required more frequent consultations between the individual parts. To this end, the delegates met from 1415 onwards for Tagsatzungen, which took place in Baden's town hall. Although other towns also organised conventions, Baden was particularly popular due to its baths and the associated diversions. The most significant matters of the entire Confederation were exclusively negotiated in Baden, including the approval of the annual accounts of all the common lordships from 1426 onward, as well as decisions on war and peace.\nThe proximity of the region to Zurich also led to its involvement in the Old Zurich War. In 1444, Baden, Mellingen and Bremgarten allied themselves with Zurich and opposed the Confederation. As a result, the Confederates besieged these three towns and recaptured them. During the Swabian War, the villages in the parish of Leuggern (located in the northwest of the county) were plundered and partially burnt down.\n\n\n=== Fricktal ===\nThe Fricktal was not conquered by the Confederates in 1415 and remained in the possession of the Habsburgs as part of Further Austria. The bailiff of Further Austria initially resided in Ensisheim in southern Alsace. Following the conquest of Alsace by France in 1651, the Fricktal was governed from Freiburg im Breisgau. Unlike today, the Rhine did not form a political border. The Fricktal valley was divided into two administrative units, the Kameralherrschaft Rheinfelden and the Kameralherrschaft Laufenburg, which were part of the Oberamt Breisgau from 1752. The area was not uniformly structured, with numerous villages directly under the Austrian administration and others where the nobility and clergy exercised individual rights of rule, particularly in lower jurisdiction. The Säckingen convent was the most important landowner and the greatest economic power in the region.\nIn comparison to the other regions, the Fricktal was significantly more affected by armed conflicts. During the Old Zurich War, Bern, Basel and Solothurn unsuccessfully besieged the town of Laufenburg. In 1445, Rheinfelden allied itself with Basel but was compelled to submit to Austrian rule once more in 1449 following a siege that lasted several months. In 1469, the Habsburgs pledged the Fricktal to Burgundy to raise funds for reparations following the Waldshut War. Following the Burgundian Wars, which was disastrous for the Burgundians, the Habsburgs reestablished control in 1477.\n\nDuring the Swabian War of 1499, peasants from the Mettau Valley plundered the neighbouring villages in Bernese Aargau with the acquiescence of Austria. In response, the villages north of the Staffelegg were devastated by the Bernese and Fribourgs. In the Rappenkrieg (1612 to 1614), the Fricktal farmers unsuccessfully defended themselves against a tax increase. Between 1633 and 1638, the Fricktal was one of the few areas of present-day Switzerland to be directly affected by the Thirty Years' War. Swedish, French and Austrian troops marched through the region. The Battle of Rheinfelden took place in 1638, resulting in a victory for the reformed side. Ultimately, more than a third of all houses in the Fricktal were destroyed, and the impoverished population required decades to overcome the consequences of the wars.\nDuring the Nine Years' War, French troops advanced through the Fricktal until they were halted by the Confederates. In 1689, the government of Further Austria was compelled to seek refuge in Klingnau for approximately one and a half years. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, the Fricktal was not directly involved in hostilities. However, the population was subjected to high war taxes, which had a significant impact on economic life. The Josephine reforms of Austrian Emperor Joseph II brought about a gradual improvement in living conditions.\n\n\n== Confessional division ==\n\n\n=== Reformation turmoil ===\nFollowing the establishment of the Reformation in Zurich in 1523, Huldrych Zwingli and his like-minded colleagues began disseminating the new doctrine in the County of Baden. Initially, this occurred in those villages in the Limmat Valley that were under Zurich control and thus largely removed from the influence of the bailiff. Additionally, individual priests also began disseminating the ideas of the Reformation in the area around Aarau and the Freie Ämter.\n\nIn 1524, the central Swiss cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Uri and Zug resolved to maintain Catholicism and sought to assert this claim in the common dominions. To this end, they convened the Baden Disputation in 1526. The German theologian Johann Eck succeeded in persuading the clergy from Baden and the surrounding area to adhere to the traditional faith, whereas Johannes Oecolampadius was unable to gain support for the Reformation. However, the Reformation attracted more and more adherents, particularly in the Zurzach region and in the lower Freiamt area around Wohlen and Bremgarten.\nBern initially adopted a neutral stance and remained undecided, particularly given that the majority of the subject territories expressed support for the old faith in an official survey. However, under pressure from the guilds, the Small Council of Bern decided to organise a religious debate. At the Bern Disputation in January 1528, the supporters of the Reformation prevailed, leading the Small Council to consistently introduce the new denomination in all Bernese subject territories, including Unteraargau. Bern proceeded to abolish all monasteries and confiscate the estates of ecclesiastical lords. This measure proved particularly beneficial to the towns, as the monasteries had previously constituted a significant economic competitor.\n\nA narrow strip of Catholic territory remained between Bern and Zurich, but half of the parishes had already converted to the new denomination. Finally, in June 1529, the First War of Kappel broke out, but largely without hostilities. In the First Peace of the Land, the Reformed villages ensured that each parish was free to choose its own faith. However, following the Second War of Kappel in 1531, which resulted in a Catholic victory, the previous conditions were reinstated under the Second Land Peace. The County of Baden and the Free Offices were re-Catholicised, on occasion through the use of force. Only in Zurzach and Tegerfelden was a Reformed majority maintained, as well as in the communities of the eastern Limmat Valley. The villages of Gebenstorf, Birmenstorf and Würenlos remained confessionally mixed. Heinrich Bullinger, the parish priest of Bremgarten, was obliged to flee to Zurich and succeeded the deceased Ulrich Zwingli.\nThe Fricktal, which was under Austrian rule, remained largely unaffected by these events. Over time, small reformed minorities in Rheinfelden and Laufenburg were re-Catholicised or emigrated to Basel.\n\n\n=== Internal contrasts and conflicts ===\nFollowing the turbulence of the Reformation, the differences between the various regions of Aargau became increasingly pronounced. In the Catholic areas, the grievances that had ultimately led to the Reformation were only gradually resolved after the Council of Trent in 1563. This was followed by a religious revival, which manifested in the construction of magnificent Baroque church buildings and the increase in pilgrimages. Muri Abbey developed into a centre of Baroque art. Between 1588 and 1650, four Capuchin monasteries (Baden, Bremgarten, Laufenburg, Rheinfelden) and one for Capuchin nuns (Baden) were also constructed in Aargau. The other monasteries also experienced an upswing, and in 1701 Muri Abbey was granted the status of a prince abbey.\nFor over a century people in Aargau followed two different calendars. The Reformed towns refused to use the Gregorian calendar introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. This resulted in a lack of mutual respect for public holidays, which repeatedly led to serious tensions. It was not until 1701 that the difference of ten days was equalised when the reformed places also adopted the improved calendar. Over time, the number of public holidays on which no work was allowed increased. The resulting lower productivity in the Catholic areas led to economic decline. The fragmentation of political responsibilities meant that nobody in the common lordships took action to improve the situation. Only in the Fricktal did the Habsburgs attempt to counteract this by introducing a state church. During the reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, numerous public holidays were abolished and pilgrimages lasting several days were banned. Nevertheless, as the controls were relatively lenient, the inhabitants of the Fricktal continued to observe their traditional customs in private.\n\nThe long-standing tensions within the confessional divide reached a boiling point in 1656 with the outbreak of the First War of Villmergen. Following the expulsion, handing over to the Inquisition, or execution of numerous reformed individuals by the authorities of the state of Schwyz, Zurich declared war on the Catholic towns. However, the campaign was poorly organised, with the allied Bernese troops being defeated by the central Swiss in the First Battle of Villmergen on 24 January. The peace treaty, which was concluded on 7 March, reaffirmed the conditions that had existed since 1531. In Baden, Stein Castle, which had been destroyed in 1415, was rebuilt as a fortress.\n\nThe conflict resumed in 1712 when the reformist inhabitants of Toggenburg revolted against the Prince-Abbot of Saint Gallen. The Second War of Villmergen initially took place mainly in eastern Switzerland but then moved westwards. In May, the Bernese occupied Mellingen, and Zurich occupied Bremgarten. In the \"Battle of the Stauden\", which took place near Fischbach-Göslikon on 26 May, the Bernese troops managed to extricate themselves from an ambush laid by the Central Swiss. Four days later, they besieged Baden in conjunction with the Zurich troops, attacked the fortress of Stein and succeeded in destroying it. Finally, on 25 July, the decisive Second Battle of Villmergen took place. The conflict concluded with a decisive defeat for the Central Swiss forces at the hands of the Bernese.\nThe power dynamics within the common lordships underwent a profound transformation. The Freie Ämter were divided into two distinct halves, with a clear and straight demarcation line extending from the church in Oberlunkhofen to the gallows in Fahrwangen. This line also delineated the village of Boswil into two unequal segments. In the upper districts, the Catholic villages were still permitted to participate in the political process, but in the lower districts, only the Reformed villages of Bern, Zurich and Glarus exercised authority in a ratio of 7:7:2. In the county of Baden, the Catholic villages were now entirely excluded from the political sphere; here, Bern, Zurich and Glarus ruled in the same ratio. The Reformed Church of Baden was established in 1714 from the ruins of the demolished fortress of Stein, which had a profound impact on the Catholic inhabitants of Baden.\nAfter 1712 Baden's significance as a venue for diplomatic conferences declined significantly. Only a few Tagsatzungen were held, as the Catholics refused to engage in discussions about the administration of the common dominions at the place of their defeat. In contrast, the peace congress organised by Emperor Charles VI and King Louis XIV of France in \"neutral\" Baden in 1714 attracted diplomats from across Europe to the spa town. This resulted in the Peace of Baden, signed on 7 September 1714 by Prince Eugene of Savoy and Claude Louis Hector de Villars. Together with the peace treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt, this treaty brought an end to the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\n\n=== Situation of the Jews ===\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews lived in many Swiss towns. However, they were not allowed to practise a trade or own land, so they were only allowed to trade and lend money. When the ban on interest for Christians was lifted, the Jews became a troublesome competition. They were expelled from the towns and settled mainly in the common lordships, where they were directly subordinate to the bailiff. From 1696, they had to buy an expensive letter of protection every 16 years. From 1776, all Jews in Switzerland were only allowed to live in the Surbtal communities of Endingen and Lengnau in the north of the county of Baden. As they were only allowed to stay in the two villages at night, their radius of action was severely restricted, leaving them practically only the Zurzach fair as a source of income.\n\n\n== Revolution and upheaval ==\n\n\n=== Forerunners of the revolt ===\nIn the second half of the 18th century the inhabitants of Aargau began to become more tolerant of followers of other denominations. At least the Bernese Aargau and the Austrian Fricktal were gradually transforming into a modern state. While cotton processing spread in Bernese Aargau (particularly through the establishment of Indienne printing works), straw plaiting emerged in the Freie Ämter.\nThe ideas of the Enlightenment found fertile ground in Bernese Aargau, particularly from 1761 onwards, when representatives of the intellectual and economic elite of the Confederation met in Schinznach-Bad to exchange ideas. This led to the establishment of the Helvetic Society the following year. Furthermore, the number of schools and libraries in the Reformed regions continued to grow. As the education system in Catholic areas was essentially non-existent, except for monasteries, Catholics reacted with suspicion and even hostility to the new ideas. Those espousing modern thought were perceived as being opposed to religion.\nFrom 1789 only a minority of wealthy merchants and educated city dwellers sympathised with the ideas of the French Revolution. As more and more French refugees reported atrocities from 1791 onwards, the level of rejection of the Revolution grew, especially among the Catholic rural population.\n\n\n=== Helvetic Republic ===\n\nIn the early months of 1798, French troops initiated an invasion of Switzerland (French invasion). On 30 January, the inhabitants of Aarau declined to provide troops to protect the city of Bern. Despite Bern's occupation of the renegade city on 4 February, it was compelled to surrender on 5 March following the Battle of Grauholz. Between 19 and 28 March, the bailiffs withdrew from the common lordships. In numerous villages and towns, freedom trees were erected, and revolutionary celebrations were organised.\nOn 12 April 1798 Peter Ochs officially proclaimed the Helvetic Republic in Aarau. Due to the pro-revolutionary attitude of the townspeople, Aarau was declared the capital. The former Bernese Aargau became the Canton of Aargau, while the County of Baden and the Freie Ämter became the Canton of Baden. The western part of the district of Aarburg remained with Bern. In the centralised republic, the cantons were merely administrative units. It soon became apparent that Aarau was too small to fully fulfil the functions of a capital city, so the government transferred to Lucerne on 20 September. On 26 April 1798, supporters of the old order from Zug and the Free Offices were defeated by French troops in the battle of Hägglingen.\nA considerable number of individuals from Aargau played a pivotal role in the new state. These included Philipp Albert Stapfer, Albrecht Rengger, Johann Rudolf Dolder, Johannes Herzog, Johann Heinrich Rothpletz and Heinrich Zschokke from Magdeburg. The Fricktal had already become a French protectorate in 1797 following the Treaty of Campo Formio. The physician Sebastian Fahrländer from Ettenheim in the district of Ortenau assumed the role of governor with the support of the French and facilitated the establishment of the canton of Fricktal, which joined the Helvetic Republic on 13 August 1802.\nIn 1799 Aargau became a theatre of war in the War of the Second Coalition between France and Austria. The inhabitants were compelled to billet and feed the troops on both sides, resulting in significant material hardship. On 16 and 17 August, 40,000 Austrian soldiers attempted unsuccessfully to cross the Aare at Döttingen. In the subsequent artillery engagement, the villages of Kleindöttingen and Eien (now part of the municipality of Böttstein) were destroyed.\nDuring this time, there were attempts at establishing a definitive border for the Aargau, but the criteria used by the proposals greatly differed. The fact that there were no fewer than three different proposals for the demarcation of the cantonal borders before they were finalised shows just how randomly they were drawn:\n\nThe initial constitution of the Helvetic Republic, drafted by Peter Ochs in January 1798, initially proposed the incorporation of the County of Baden and the Freiamt into the Canton of Zug. However, this was rejected by the French and also failed due to strong opposition from Zug itself. Following two coups d'état in 1800, the Malmaison Constitution, drawn up by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, provided for the cantons of Aargau and Baden to be merged and the lower Fricktal to be ceded to the canton of Basel. In the summer of 1801, activists attempted to collect signatures in favour of the reunification of Bernese Aargau with Bern but were prevented from doing so by Aargau government troops. Following a third coup d'état on 27 October 1801, those in favour of the status quo revoked the merger of the two cantons.\nThe second constitution of the Helvetic Republic of 1802, which was drawn up following another change of power, stipulated that the cantons of Aargau and Baden were to be reunited. Zug was to receive the upper Freiamt, while Lucerne was to gain the Amt Hitzkirch. The Fricktal was to remain an independent canton. However, the implementation of this constitution was thwarted by Napoleon's decision to withdraw French troops from Switzerland in July 1802, a move that was motivated by his frustration with the perceived ineptitude of the Helvetic authorities.\nImmediately a civil war-like atmosphere of unrest emerged, with opponents of the revolution launching attacks against the supporters of the French. During the Stecklikrieg in September, an ever-increasing number of impoverished country folk marched from Aargau to Bern, engaging in plunder and forcing the Helvetic government to flee to Lausanne. On 21 September, hatred was unleashed against the Jews, who were perceived as supporters of the new order. In the \"Plum War\", a large group of approximately 800 men invaded the towns of Endingen and Lengnau, seizing the belongings of the local population, who were unable to defend themselves.\n\n\n=== Napoleon's decisive authority ===\n\nOn 30 September 1802 the Helvetic state crisis reached its zenith. Napoleon Bonaparte feigned the role of a mediator between the conflicting parties. He threatened renewed French military occupation and demanded that a delegation from all the cantons be sent to Paris. This Helvetic Consulta was to negotiate a new constitution. On 12 January 1803, Napoleon finally decided to merge the cantons of Aargau and Baden. This decision was entirely in line with the wishes of the Aargau delegation, which was led by Philipp Albert Stapfer. After the people of Fricktal had successfully petitioned against the division of this region into a Basel and an Aargau part, Napoleon decreed the merger of the entire region with Aargau on 2 February.\nThe members of the Consulta finally signed the revised Act of Mediation, which was approved by Napoleon, on 19 February 1803. This resulted in the dissolution of the centralised Helvetic Republic and the establishment of a loose confederation of states, with Aargau as an independent canton. Furthermore, Napoleon established the definitive border. The canton of Aargau acquired the western portion of the district of Aarburg and the Lucerne district of Merenschwand, yet was obliged to relinquish the district of Hitzkirch to Lucerne and the municipalities of Dietikon, Hüttikon, Oetwil an der Limmat and Schlieren to Zurich. Aarau was designated as the capital.\n\n\n== New Canton ==\n\n\n=== Government structure ===\nNapoleon Bonaparte established the canton of Aargau, an artificial entity comprising four distinct regions of the country, whose inhabitants exhibited minimal shared characteristics and no common historical legacy. In the year of its foundation, Aargau had a population of 131,000, of whom 67,000 lived in the reformed Bernese Aargau and 64,000 in the Catholic areas of Freiamt, Fricktal and the County of Baden. There was no recognised state authority, and thus a completely new state had to be established on this basis.\n\nThe recently adopted Aargau cantonal constitution established that the majority of authority resided with the nine-member Small Council. The Grand Council, the parliament comprising 150 members, was only authorised to approve or reject laws, but not to make any amendments to them. The strict age and wealth limits in electoral law ensured that only approximately seven per cent of the population were eligible to vote (so-called active citizens). The concept of separation of powers was entirely alien to the system. Indeed, the members of the Small Council were also members of the Grand Council and were elected from their ranks.\nThe most pressing tasks were the establishment of a legal framework and the formation of a cantonal administration, which initially comprised just 15 civil servants. The government and parliament initially convened in Aarau town hall. Between 1811 and 1823, a former inn in Aarau was converted into a distinguished government building. The Grand Council building, the seat of the cantonal parliament, was inaugurated in 1829. The introduction of new symbols to reinforce the sense of community was also of significant importance: in 1803, Samuel Ringier from Zofingen created the new cantonal coat of arms.\n\n\n=== Canton of culture ===\nThe new canton assumed a prominent position in Switzerland in the cultural and educational realms. The cantonal school in Aarau, the inaugural Gymnasium in Switzerland whose instructors were not members of the clergy, had already been established by a private entity in 1802. The school was subsequently taken over by the canton in 1813 and developed into one of the most respected gymnasiums in the country due to its liberal attitude, producing numerous well-known politicians and three Nobel Prize winners, including Albert Einstein. Aargau also played a pioneering role in the lower school levels. In 1805, one of the first secondary schools for young women was established in the former Olsberg convent, which was considered very progressive at the time. In 1835, the former Latin schools were also taken over by the canton and converted into progymnasial district schools. With the purchase of the Zurlauben collection in 1803, the foundation was laid for the cantonal library in Aarau, which opened in 1807.\n\nIn 1811, Heinrich Zschokke and numerous fellow campaigners founded the \"Society for Patriotic Culture.\" The society, whose members included numerous prominent politicians and business leaders, created a savings fund, supported the founding and equipping of numerous schools and welfare institutions, and promoted the general education of the people with early forms of adult education centres. The society's numerous activities, which radiated throughout Switzerland, earned Aargau the nickname \"canton of culture.\" The concept of supporting charitable causes out of pure patriotism was novel at the time and met with scepticism, particularly among conservative circles.\nThose in favour of the old order were more concerned about the liberal Aargau press, which was permitted to flourish unhindered in contrast to other cantons than they were about the cultural society. From 1804, Heinrich Zschokke published the Schweizer Boten, one of the most widely read newspapers in Switzerland during the 19th century. In 1814, Paul Usteri established the Aarauer Zeitung, which ceased publication in 1821 due to numerous protests from foreign aristocrats and diplomats. Usteri subsequently relocated to Zurich, where he facilitated the transition of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung into Switzerland's leading liberal newspaper. Nevertheless, even after this, censorship in Aargau remained comparatively lenient, with the full abolition of censorship occurring in 1829.\n\n\n=== Threat to continued existence ===\nFrance's \"tutelage\" lasted until 1813. On 21 December of that year, German, Russian and Austrian troops crossed the Rhine and pursued the French troops, who retreated to southern Germany and France. In total, more than 80,000 foreign soldiers marched through northern Aargau. The foreign armies brought with them a devastating typhus epidemic. It is estimated that approximately 3,000 Austrian soldiers died in the military hospitals in Klingnau. The population was also affected to some extent, particularly in the Rheinfelden district.\nFollowing the restoration of power in Bern to the aristocratic circles, who had received assistance from Napoleon's opponents, the reincorporation of the Aargau as a subject territory was demanded. Zug laid claim to the upper Freiamt. At the Congress of Vienna, the continued existence of the canton of Aargau was at stake. The Aargau delegate Albrecht Rengger demonstrated his negotiating abilities, thus preventing the restoration of the old order. On 20 March 1815, the major European powers guaranteed the continued existence of the nascent canton. The people of Aargau were able to rely on the support of the Russian Tsar Alexander I, who had a close relationship with Switzerland through his tutor Frédéric-César de La Harpe.\n\n\n=== Restoration and regeneration ===\n\nIn the wake of the Restoration, conservative forces implemented a revision of the cantonal constitution in 1814. The Small Council was expanded from nine to thirteen members, its term of office was extended from five to twelve years, and the popular election of the Grand Council was further restricted. Consequently, only forty-eight out of one hundred and fifty Grand Councillors could now be elected directly by the people. The Grand Council itself elected 52 members, while an electoral college chose the remaining 50 Grand Councillors. Authorities had to be made up of equal numbers of Catholic and Reformed members. Despite this constitution, which is undemocratic by today's standards, Aargau was considered one of the most liberal cantons in Switzerland. After all, freedom of establishment and trade was enshrined and all professional privileges were abolished.\n\nThe government became increasingly authoritarian, leading to the emergence of the \"Duchy of Aargau\" as a metaphorical reference to Small Councillor Johannes Herzog, who dominated the government and styled himself \"von Effingen,\" despite not being of noble birth. The government's inability to reform led to the formation of an opposition movement in the autumn of 1830. On 7 November, approximately 3,000 to 4,000 individuals gathered in Wohlenschwil to demand constitutional reforms. The elections to the Grand Council, scheduled for 17 November, were only held properly in 26 of 48 constituencies due to the prevailing unrest. Finally, on 5 and 6 December 1830, the Freiämtersturm took place. Between 5,000 and 6,000 armed men, led by Johann Heinrich Fischer, marched from Merenschwand and Wohlen to the cantonal capital and compelled the government to resign in a bloodless revolt.\nThe new constitution, which came into force in 1831, was the first to be approved in a referendum. The restrictive electoral law was relaxed, and the people now directly elected almost all the Grand Councillors. This represented a significant step towards the separation of powers, as the Grand Council (legislature) was now authorised to discuss and amend laws. The authority of the Small Council now designated the Government Council and comprising a mere nine members, was curtailed. Aargau was now among the vanguard of those engaged in the process of Regeneration.\n\n\n=== Religious and political conflicts ===\nThe rift between the Reformed and Catholics deepened. The liberal government, dominated by the Reformed, sought to limit the influence of the Catholic Church, which the faithful perceived as an encroachment on their way of life. A contentious issue had already arisen in 1829 when Aargau was transferred from the diocese of Constance to the diocese of Basel against the wishes of the Catholics. The Baden Articles, passed by seven liberal cantons in 1834, served to exacerbate the situation. These Articles called for the establishment of a national bishopric independent of Rome and stronger state supervision in church matters. Those priests who did not swear allegiance to the Constitution were subject to fines or imprisonment. Furthermore, the canton placed the assets of the monasteries under state supervision, closed the monastery schools and imposed a ban on the further admission of novices.\nThe 1831 constitution provided for a total revision within ten years. The new constitution, drawn up at the end of 1840, was almost identical to the old one and was rejected in the referendum. The liberals objected to parity, the principle that there had to be an equal number of Reformed and Catholics in all authorities. The second draft was favourable to them and was approved by 58% on 5 January 1841. The approval rate varied considerably, ranging from 0% in the Catholic constituency of Rohrdorf to 99% in the Reformed constituency of Brugg. Conservative-Catholic circles around the Bünz Committee were not prepared to accept the result and instigated riots in Freiamt and the Baden region. Government troops swiftly suppressed them, and by 12 January the situation had returned to normal. The conflict was characterised by a single minor skirmish near Villmergen, during which two government soldiers and seven insurgents died.\nOn 13 January the Catholic seminary director Augustin Keller delivered a diatribe at the Grand Council. He described the monasteries as the source of all evil and the mastermind behind the conservative coup attempt, and called for their immediate abolition. The government did not require any further prompting and proceeded to confiscate the monasteries' assets in a gross breach of the constitution. The nuns were given an eight-day deadline, while the monks were required to leave the canton within 48 hours. Although some monasteries had already been secularised following the canton's foundation, the severity of this measure led to the Aargau Monastery controversy. This almost resulted in a war with Austria and was only settled in 1843 with the re-authorisation of four women's monasteries.\n\nSubsequently, the canton of Aargau played a pivotal role in the Free Guard campaigns (1844/45) and the agitation against the Jesuits, who had been employed as teachers by the new conservative government in Lucerne. The cantons of Central Switzerland, Valais and Fribourg joined to form the Sonderbund. The refusal to dissolve this union led to the Sonderbund War in 1847. Government Councillor Friedrich Frey-Herosé (later Federal Councillor) was the Chief of Staff of the Tagsatzung troops. The Battle of Geltwil on 12 November 1847 was the only armed conflict on Aargau territory. Following the defeat of the conservatives, the confederation was dissolved in 1848 and gave way to the federal state that still exists today. Confessional tensions gradually subsided as a result, with other problems now taking centre stage.\nThe fifth constitution of 1852 introduced further improvements in terms of the separation of powers and was no longer controversial, even among Catholics. It was not until 1863 that the Jews were granted full equality with the other citizens of the canton. Consequently, they migrated to the large cities, where they found better employment opportunities. The old denominational differences resurfaced briefly after 1870 when Aargau assumed a leading role in the Kulturkampf. In Fricktal in particular, numerous adherents joined the new Christian Catholic Church. The sixth constitution of 1885 finally reconciled the Reformed and Catholics, expanded the people's rights, and formed the basis of the state until 1980.\n\n\n=== From a farming to an industrial canton ===\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, three-field farming, which had been practised since the early Middle Ages, was gradually replaced by crop rotation in agriculture. This was accompanied by the establishment of potato cultivation. The dissolution of the commons had created a lot of pastureland, which led to an increase in livestock farming. This process was completed around 1830 and led to an unprecedented increase in productivity. The replacement of the tithes lasted until 1850. In the second half of the nineteenth century, grain cultivation was replaced by dairy farming and fodder cultivation due to the cheap imports that were now possible thanks to the railway. The last famine occurred in 1816 in the so-called Year Without a Summer and resulted in a major wave of emigration.\nBefore 1800 the earliest forms of industry had only developed in Bernese Aargau. Favoured by the targeted economic policy of the Bernese rulers, numerous textile factories and trading companies were established. The towns of Aarau, Lenzburg and Zofingen were the main beneficiaries of this development. The other small towns in the Aargau initially retained their role as market and craft centres. The rest of the canton was almost exclusively agricultural. By the end of the 18th century, there were no factories in the County of Baden or the Fricktal. However, there were at least a few straw weavers in Freiamt. In 1810, Johannes Herzog constructed the first mechanical spinning mill in Aarau. Factories, which mainly processed cotton, silk and straw, were also established in other locations. By the end of the 1830s, the tobacco industry had been established in the Wyna valley and the upper Seetal.\n\nThe straw and wickerwork industry, centred in Wohlen and the rest of the Freiamt, became the most important branch of industry in the second third of the 19th century, exporting its products all over the world. Its importance declined rapidly after 1900 when cheaper East Asian products came onto the market, and it almost disappeared after 1960. At its peak around 1860, almost 30,000 people were employed in the straw industry, most of them at home.\n\nBenefiting from the political stability after 1848 and the construction of the railways, new industries were soon added. These included the cement industry in the Aare Valley and salt mining and brewing in the western Fricktal. But textiles remained by far the most important industry. Nearly all factories depended on watercourses for their power; in 1859 there were only eleven steam engines in the whole canton.\nFrom 1860 the metalworking industry began to develop in the Limmat and Reuss valleys, as did the shoe industry in a decentralised manner. Brown, Boveri & Cie was founded in Baden in 1892 as part of the project for the first hydroelectric power station in Aargau. The company manufactured generators, turbines and motors and quickly made the Baden region the centre of the Swiss electrical industry. From 1890, the mechanical engineering industry also began to expand in Aargau.\nThe first local savings banks were established in 1812. From 1850 several commercial banks were established, including the Aargauische Bank, founded in 1854 by the politician and railway pioneer Carl Feer-Herzog, which became the Aargauische Kantonalbank in 1913. Apart from the spa towns of Baden, Schinznach-Bad and Rheinfelden, tourism did not play a major role. In 1900, 43.4% of the workforce was employed in agriculture, 42.4% in industry and 14.2% in services.\n\n\n=== Expansion of transport infrastructure ===\nThe rapid economic development of the 19th century would have been unthinkable without a well-developed transport infrastructure. Although only a few new roads had to be built after the canton was founded, the majority were in a precarious state. Consequently, goods and passengers were transported by boat on the rivers, which was not without danger due to the numerous rapids and shallows that existed at the time. The new canton initially used a significant proportion of its tax revenue for road construction. The most significant projects were the connections from Aarau via Staffelegg to Frick, from Bremgarten via Mutschellen to Dietikon, between Laufenburg and Koblenz and between Lenzburg and Reinach. When the canton assumed responsibility for the postal service in 1804, there were only ten post offices in the entire canton of Aargau. The daily stagecoach service between Aarau and Zurich commenced in 1820. By the time the Confederation assumed responsibility for the postal service in 1849, the number of post offices had increased tenfold.\n\nThe railway was the catalyst for a revolution in the field of transport. In 1837, a private initiative from Zurich presented a project for a line from Zurich via Baden, Koblenz, Laufenburg and Rheinfelden to Basel. However, all Swiss railway projects initially failed due to the \"small-state-ery\" and the unstable political situation. Finally, on 7 August 1847, the Swiss Northern Railway opened Switzerland's first railway line between Zurich and Baden. Further construction stalled and could only be continued after the Nordbahn was merged into the Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB). The latter constructed the Baden-Turgi-Brugg (1856), Brugg-Wildegg-Aarau (1858) and Turgi-Koblenz-Waldshut (1859) lines. The west of the canton was opened up by lines of the Swiss Central Railway (SCB). The construction of the Aarau-Olten-Aarburg-Emmenbrücke (1856) and Aarburg-Bern (1857) lines further expanded the network of the two largest Swiss railway companies, which met in Aarau to complete the basic network.\n\nAfter 1870, a period of railway expansion commenced throughout Switzerland, including in Aargau. Joint subsidiaries were established by the NOB and SCB, and the Bözberg line between Brugg and Basel was constructed and opened in 1875. Additionally, the Aargau Southern Railway between Rupperswil and Rotkreuz was built and connected to the new Gotthard railway between 1874 and 1881. Additionally, the NOB constructed the Wohlen-Bremgarten branch line in 1876 and the Hendschiken-Brugg line in 1882. The NOB also constructed a line along the Rhine, which was opened in two stages (1876 and 1892). The Seetal railway line, which was established with British capital, inaugurated the Lenzburg-Lucerne route in 1883. The extension to Wildegg was subsequently completed in 1895, while the branch line from Beinwil am See to Beromünster was opened in two stages in 1887 and 1906.\nThe Swiss National Railway (SNB) commenced operations in 1877. The company planned a second east–west main line between Lake Constance and Lake Geneva, which was to compete with the established \"gentlemen's railway\" of high finance as a broad-based \"people's railway\". In Aargau, the line ran from Würenlos via Wettingen, Lenzburg and Suhr to Zofingen (with a branch from Suhr to Aarau). However, the SNB went bankrupt as early as 1878 and was purchased at auction by the NOB for a fraction of its value. The municipalities along the route had invested a significant amount of capital and were consequently burdened with substantial financial obligations as a consequence of the bankruptcy. In certain instances, the repayment of debts extended into the 1930s.\n\n\n=== Population ===\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the population of the region in question increased by almost 60 per cent (1798: 125,669 inhabitants; 1850: 199,852 inhabitants), primarily due to a high birth surplus. This trend reversed after 1850. For almost 40 years, Aargau was the only canton with a declining population (1888: 193,580 inhabitants). This was due to numerous economic crises, which resulted in many Aargau residents having to leave their canton. The majority of these individuals relocated to large cities such as Zurich and Basel, while around a third emigrated overseas (mostly to the US). However, this development varied greatly from region to region. The exodus had a particularly significant impact on rural communities, with the upper Fricktal and Zurzibiet experiencing a notable decline in population (the community of Baldingen, for example, lost almost half of its population). In contrast, industrial centres such as Aarau, Baden, Brugg, Rheinfelden and Wettingen demonstrated a notable increase in population. From 1890 onwards, there was another slight increase in population, with a total of 206,498 individuals recorded in 1900.\n\n\n== 20th and 21st centuries ==\n\n\n=== Impact of the world wars ===\nThe outbreak of the First World War caught the population completely unprepared, leading to a surge in hoarding and a subsequent increase in food prices. Despite modest price control measures, these were ineffective in the context of high inflation and long periods of military operations, which resulted in significant material hardship for large sections of the population throughout the war. In the summer of 1918, the Spanish flu broke out. As there were insufficient hospitals to care for the numerous individuals afflicted with illness, 20 regional emergency hospitals were established. Despite the cantonal government's prohibition of public gatherings, approximately 750 individuals perished from the virus in Aargau by May 1919, with approximately one-tenth of the population becoming infected. The national strike in November 1918 was particularly popular in the industrial centre of Baden. The cantonal government was concerned that a revolutionary upheaval might occur and deployed 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers to protect those willing to work, set up checkpoints and prevent any outbreaks of violence. After three days, the national strike ended without incident.\nIn response to the national strike, right-wing conservative circles established vigilante groups in various municipalities without any legal basis. Eugen Bircher unified these groups in the Aargau Patriotic Association, which at times had over 15,000 members and exerted a significant influence on the anti-communist Swiss Patriotic Federation. The consequences of the Great Depression were felt in Aargau in the form of company closures and rising unemployment figures. In response to the economic crisis, the cantonal government implemented numerous employment programs, which primarily focused on infrastructure construction. In 1933, the National Front, influenced by the National Socialist seizure of power in the neighbouring German Reich, attempted to gain a foothold in the region. It organized rallies, published propaganda newspapers, and established local groups. However, it only won one seat in the 1937 parliamentary elections and subsequently disappeared into obscurity.\nSwitzerland was demonstrably better prepared for the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 than it had been a quarter of a century earlier. To ward off a possible German attack, the 5th Division was deployed to cover the Aargau border region and occupy positions in the Jura, along the Rhine and on the Limmat line. In the summer of 1941, it was withdrawn following the réduit strategy and relocated to the Alpine region. From the outset of the war, food was rationed. As part of the \"Anbauschlacht\" initiative, the arable land in Aargau was expanded by 113% through clearing, melioration and conversion of grassland. By 1945, arable land accounted for 42% of the cultivated land, compared to 23% at the beginning of the war. To continue importing the raw materials that were urgently needed, Switzerland was forced to co-operate economically with the Axis powers. Aargau power plants supplied electricity to Germany, and the Allies blacklisted numerous Aargau companies (above all Brown, Boveri & Cie.).\nFrom 1940 some 2,000 Polish soldiers were interned in 19 camps in the canton. They were employed in agriculture and road construction, with the most notable example being the \"Polenstrasse\" in Thalheim. Furthermore, there were an additional 1,000 internees (including deserters and escaped prisoners of war). Allied aircraft dropped bombs over the Aargau on several occasions. This resulted in significant damage to buildings in Koblenz, Full-Reuenthal, Leuggern and Sins. At the end of April 1945, several thousand German refugees crossed the border and were housed in camps. In contrast to orders given to retreating Wehrmacht soldiers, they did not carry out the destruction of the Rhine power stations.\n\n\n=== Political development ===\nFollowing the comprehensive revision of the cantonal constitution in 1885, the people of Aargau adopted a cautious approach to the introduction of further popular rights, demonstrating a lack of enthusiasm for progress. The canton of Aargau was one of the last to implement the popular election of members of the cantonal government and the Council of States in 1904. The introduction of proportional representation at the cantonal level was not until 1920 (29 years after the canton of Ticino). Although women were eligible for election to cantonal councils for the poor from 1936 and for school boards from 1940, full voting rights for women were not introduced until 1971.\nThe first political parties emerged in the 1890s. The Catholic-Conservative Party (now the Christian Democratic People's Party) was founded in 1892, followed by the Free Democratic Party in 1894. In 1902, the early labour movements joined the Social Democratic Party. Until the introduction of proportional representation, the Free Democrats held a majority both in parliament and in government. The Social Democrats subsequently ascended to become the most powerful party, a position they retained until 1981. Following the establishment of farmers' parties in 1917, these parties merged in 1936 to form the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents. The resulting Swiss People's Party was able to significantly expand its electoral base from the 1980s onwards, becoming the party with the largest number of voters. Other parties represented in the Grand Council are (or were) the Evangelical People's Party (since 1921), the Alliance of Independents (1937–2001), the Young Farmers' Movement (1937–1957), the Green Party (since 1985), the Auto Party (1991–2005), the Conservative Democratic Party (since 2009) and the Green Liberal Party (since 2009). The nationalist Republican movement reached its zenith in the 1960s, subsequently merging into the Swiss Democrats.\nThe number of members of the Grand Council was fixed at 200 in 1952; since 2005, it has been 140. The comprehensive revision of the cantonal constitution, which commenced in 1972, was relatively moderate following an initial period of enthusiastic reorganization. The new constitution came into force in 1980, following the rejection of an initial draft in 1979 that sought to replace the mandatory with the optional legislative and financial referendum. The state's catalogue of fundamental rights and duties was updated, and the Grand Council was also given planning powers. Since1966, larger municipalities replaced their municipal assemblies with residents' councils, as they found it increasingly challenging to achieve a negotiating capacity (according to the law at the time, at least half of those entitled to vote had to be present at municipal assemblies). By 1974, 15 municipalities had made use of this option. Nevertheless, between 1981 and 1997, Aarburg, Oftringen, Spreitenbach and Suhr reverted to the previous system for a variety of reasons.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\n\n==== Agriculture ====\nIn 1880 vineyards covered an area of approximately 2,700 hectares. Following the impact of phylloxera and mildew in Aargau after 1900, the area under vines shrank to 330 hectares by 1935. The lowest point was reached around 1965 with 212 hectares. Since that time, the area under vines has increased again, reaching over 400 hectares. This growth is largely attributable to the efforts of amateur winegrowers. The most prevalent varieties cultivated are Müller-Thurgau (also known in Switzerland as Riesling x Sylvaner) and Pinot noir. The most significant growing regions are the lower Aare valley, the lower Surbtal, the Limmatt valley, the upper Fricktal and the Schenkenbergertal.\n\nThe mechanisation of agriculture commenced in 1900, initially resulting in an increase in productivity and subsequently causing a reduction in the workforce. By 1941, the proportion of individuals employed in agriculture was 21%, declining to just under 3% by 2000. The number of farms in Switzerland fell from 18,777 in 1939 to 6,845 in 1990, while the average farm size increased from 4.5 to 9.5 hectares over the same period. Since the 1950s, the cultivation of sugar beet and maize has been the dominant agricultural practice. The fruit trees and hedges that were once abundant have largely disappeared as a result of melioration and the consolidation of estates. The excessive use of fertilisers has resulted in a high level of pollution in the waters, with Lake Hallwil, for example, requiring the introduction of artificial aeration since 1986.\n\n\n==== Electricity sector ====\n\nThe introduction of electricity played a significant role in the industrialisation of the region. The abundance of water in the Aargau facilitated the construction of hydroelectric power stations. Between 1892 and 1914, ten plants with an output of more than one megawatt were constructed, six by 1945 and three more by 1966. The plants significantly altered the landscape with their dams and backwaters. The numerous rapids and gravel banks disappeared almost completely, as did the floodplains. In 1935, the Klingnau reservoir was dammed during the construction of the Klingnau power plant, and in 1975 the Flachsee on the Reuss was dammed. Several energy supply companies based in Aargau were established, including AEW, Axpo, Motor-Columbus and EGL. In 1993, a popular initiative was adopted that requires the canton to renaturalise the river banks and establish a floodplain conservation park. This park should cover one per cent of the canton's area, which equates to approximately 14 km2, by 2014.\n\nThe rivers also offered ideal conditions for the construction of nuclear power plants, which require large quantities of cooling water. The Beznau Nuclear Power Plant (Block A in 1969, Block B in 1971) was opened without any major protests. In contrast, the situation was different with the construction of the Leibstadt Nuclear Power Plant, which was met with significant opposition. Following the reactor incident at Three Mile Island, new safety regulations were introduced, and the plant could only be inaugurated in 1984 after eleven years of construction. The construction was also accompanied by fierce protests. The planned Kaiseraugst Nuclear Power Plant failed due to fierce opposition from the population and environmental groups. The most spectacular action was an eleven-week occupation of the construction site in 1975. The project was finally abandoned in 1988.\nThe Swiss Federal Institute for Reactor Research (EIR) was established in 1960, followed by the Swiss Institute of Nuclear Physics (SIN) in 1968. The latter institution gave rise to the Paul Scherrer Institute (a multidisciplinary research institute specialising in nuclear research) in Villigen and Würenlingen in 1988. Currently, Aargau generates approximately a quarter of Switzerland's total electricity output, a figure that has earned it the sobriquet \"Energy Canton.\" The canton is occasionally derisively referred to as \"Nuclear Aargau.\"\n\n\n==== Industry ====\nBy 1910, 51% of all employees were already engaged in industrial work. The machine, metal and apparatus industries (and the electrical industry in the Baden region) became increasingly significant, displacing the textile industry from the top position around 1920. Concurrently, home-based work became less prevalent. The district of Baden benefited most from industrialisation and rose to become the most populous district. This was largely due to the success of Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), which became the largest private employer in Switzerland. By 1930, Aargau was the third most industrialised canton in Switzerland, behind Solothurn and Glarus. The economic crises at the beginning of the 1920s and in the 1930s led to the closure of many businesses, particularly in the textile industry. Following the economic boom and the influx of foreign labour in the post-war period, there was a marked expansion of industrial and construction capacity. By 1960, the proportion of the population employed in the industry had risen to 62 per cent.\n\nA growing number of companies from the Zurich and Basel areas relocated their space-intensive production sites to Aargau. This is particularly evident in the case of the Basel chemical industry, which has constructed several large production facilities in the lower Fricktal. In addition, numerous Aargau companies have expanded their operations, such as BBC, which has outsourced its production to Birrfeld and the Lenzburg area. The production of cement remains a significant industry in the region, with the majority of facilities concentrated in the Aare Valley and the Zurzibiet. Holderbank (now LafargeHolcim), named after the municipality of the same name, grew to become the second-largest cement group in the world.\n\nThe structural change that occurred in the mid-1970s as a result of the economic crisis did not have the same impact on Aargau as it did on other regions. This was due to the more diverse range of industries present in the canton. However, the service sector has since become the most important economic sector in Aargau, with small and medium-sized enterprises becoming increasingly important. In 2008, the proportion of industrial jobs in the canton was still 34 per cent. The rapid expansion of industry following the Second World War also led to an increase in environmental pollution. Until the 1970s, waste was disposed of almost exclusively in landfill sites. The first waste incineration plant was established in Turgi in 1970, followed by two further plants in Buchs in 1973 and Oftringen in 1974. The Kölliken hazardous waste landfill, which commenced operations in 1978, is regarded as the largest contaminated site in Switzerland. Despite its relatively brief operational lifespan of seven years, the landfill is subject to extensive remediation. The remediation process, which commenced in 2005, is estimated to cost up to CHF 770 million.\n\n\n==== Service sector ====\nAlthough the proportion of people employed in the service sector rose steadily throughout the 20th century, it consistently remained below the national average. For a considerable period, Aargau was regarded as a typical industrial canton. It was not until the mid-1980s that the share of industry was surpassed, with the proportion amounting to 62 per cent in 2008. The canton of Aargau benefited from its excellent road network, which facilitated the establishment of a greater number of logistics companies and shopping centres than would be expected given its size. Tourism remained a relatively minor industry, with the addition of a fourth spa in Bad Zurzach in 1955, in addition to the traditional spas in Baden, Rheinfelden and Schinznach-Bad.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Railway ====\n\nFollowing the turn of the century, only a few new railway lines were constructed. These railways, which were electric from the outset, were primarily used for local transport. The Aarau-Schöftland Railway was inaugurated in 1901, followed by the Wynental Railway in 1904. These two-metre-gauge railways merged in 1967 to form the Wynental and Suhrental Railway (WSB). In 1902, the Bremgarten–Dietikon Railway, also metre-gauge, commenced operations. In 1912 it leased the Wohlen-Bremgarten West line from the SBB. The standard gauge Wohlen-Meisterschwanden railway was completed in 1916.\nThe next significant extension was not realised until 1975. The Heitersberg tunnel between Mellingen and Killwangen considerably shortened the journey time on the Bern-Zurich route, as it eliminated the diversions via Brugg and Baden. At the same time, the large Limmattal marshalling yard went into operation in Spreitenbach. Since 1990, the Zurich S-Bahn has operated to Baden and Brugg, and since 1997 the Basel S-Bahn has connected the Fricktal. On some lines, passenger services were discontinued due to low usage or inadequate access quality and replaced by bus services. The following lines were replaced: Lenzburg-Wildegg (1984), Beinwil am See-Beromünster (1992), Laufenburg-Koblenz (1994) and Wohlen-Meisterschwanden (1997).\nThe most significant change occurred with the inauguration of the Rail 2000 project on 12 December 2004. This involved the opening of the new Mattstetten-Rothrist line and the \"war loop\" between Zofingen and Rothrist. The latter was originally constructed in 1941 but had not yet been operationalised. Conversely, the SBB ceased passenger traffic on the former national railway lines Aarau-Suhr and Mellingen-Wettingen. This was partially offset by the extension of the Zurich S-Bahn through the Heitersberg tunnel to Aarau. The former SBB sections Reinach-Menziken and Aarau-Suhr were converted to metre gauge and have been operated by the WSB since 2003 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\n==== Road transport ====\n\nThe expansion of the road network was a far more significant phenomenon than railway construction in the 20th century. The advent of the motor vehicle saw a rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road, particularly after the Second World War. The most urgent task was initially to tarmac the gravel roads. In 1950, only 85 per cent of cantonal roads and 21 per cent of local roads had a hard surface. Twenty years later, all roads were fully paved.\nBetween 1966 and 1980 the A1 and A2 motorways were constructed on Aargau soil. The A3 initially ran between Kaiseraugst and Frick. The closure of the gap between Frick and the Birrfeld motorway junction was postponed until 1996 due to protracted negotiations over a route that would minimise environmental impact. Until 2003, the Baregg Tunnel near Baden constituted a significant bottleneck throughout Switzerland. Its elimination required the construction of a third tunnel tube. In addition to the motorways, a network of over 100 kilometres of four-lane expressways was planned. However, these projects were conceived in the utopian belief in progress of the 1960s, were ultimately abandoned following the economic crisis of the 1970s, and only a small fraction of them were realised.\nGiven that a significant proportion of both east–west and north–south traffic passes through Aargau (both by road and rail), Aargau is perceived as a \"transit canton\".\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nSince the beginning of the 20th century there have been repeated plans to expand the waterways for large goods ships. One such project was the proposal to make the High Rhine navigable from Rheinfelden to Koblenz in 1913. Another, the Limmat Canal project, was presented in 1924 but was cancelled after the Second World War. In the early 1950s, the Trans-Helvetic Canal project was proposed between the mouth of the Aare and Lake Geneva. The barrages of the hydroelectric power stations would have been overcome with locks, and large river harbours were planned at Brugg, Klingnau and Full-Reuenthal, which would have completely changed the landscape. Over time, all of these projects were increasingly seen as unnecessary and unprofitable, and they also failed due to opposition from the local population and environmental protection groups (above all the Working Group for the Protection of the Aare). Consequently, the projects were finally shelved in 1989.\n\n\n=== Population ===\nFrom 1890 the population began to grow again, particularly in the industrial areas and especially in the Baden region. The proportion of Swiss citizens not born in Aargau rose from 8 to 31 per cent between 1888 and 1950. The proportion of foreigners reached a temporary peak of 8 per cent in 1910 (52 per cent of foreigners at that time were German, 37 per cent Italian). The growth levelled off in the inter-war period. The proportion of foreigners fell to 3 per cent by 1941.\nAfter the Second World War the economic boom triggered a veritable growth spurt, with average annual growth of 1.3% between 1950 and 2000. Growth was particularly strong in the districts of Baden, Bremgarten and Rheinfelden, which were catching up with the fast-growing conurbations of Zurich and Basel. An extreme example is Spreitenbach, where the population increased sixfold during this period. The district of Aarau also experienced strong growth.\nIt can be observed that approximately half of the population growth between 1950 and 1970 was due to the immigration of foreigners, predominantly Italians. The majority of foreign labourers were Catholic, and thus in 1970, the number of Catholics exceeded that of Protestants for the first time since the Reformation. The proportion of foreigners rose to 18 per cent. Following the increased emigration of foreigners between 1975 and 1978, caused by the recession, their numbers rose steadily once more. Since 1980, the proportion of Italians in the foreign population has been on a downward trajectory. Currently, the majority of immigrants originate from the Balkan states and Turkey.\nIn 2009 the population exceeded 600,000. During the period of rapid growth that occurred in the 1960s, spatial planners had assumed a population of 1.15 million in the year 2000. Various plans were put in place to steer this targeted growth in the right direction. Garden cities with several thousand inhabitants were planned at various locations. Spreitenbach, for instance, was projected to have 30,000 inhabitants upon completion (the actual population is just over 10,000). The most prominent urban development project was the proposed Aarolfingen, which envisioned a metropolis of approximately 350,000 inhabitants in the Aarau-Olten-Zofingen area. However, this project failed due to a lack of public support and the economic crisis of the 1970s.\nDespite this rapid growth (the population increased by more than 200,000 in the second half of the 20th century), no real centre has yet developed. Compared with the rest of Switzerland, Aargau has an above-average number of municipalities. Only Aarau and Wettingen have more than 20,000 inhabitants. The lack of a strong centre means that even 200 years after the canton was founded, there is still a pronounced regionalism. The districts of Baden, Bremgarten and Zurzach are strongly oriented towards the canton of Zurich, and in many municipalities, the proportion of commuters from outside the canton exceeds 30 per cent. The district of Rheinfelden is increasingly oriented towards Basel, the district of Muri towards Zug and Lucerne, and the district of Zofingen towards Olten and Bern.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== General ===\nGautschi, Willi (1978).

        "content": "Ruach Planitia is a roughly circular flat plain and probable cryolava lake on Neptune's moon Triton. It is located in Triton's northern hemisphere within Monad Regio and directly borders the cryovolcanic plains of Cipango Planum. Ruach Planitia, along with the other walled plains on Triton, is one of the youngest and flattest features on Triton.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nRuach Planitia was discovered alongside Triton's other surface features by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby of the Neptune system on 25 August 1989. The name Ruach Planitia was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1991; Ruach Planitia is named after the legendary French Isle of Ruach.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nRuach Planitia is quasi-circular in shape and some 175–180 km in diameter.: 869  The floor of Ruach Planitia is depressed by about 200 meters relative to the surrounding plains,: 106  with the floor surrounded by bounding scarp that ranges in height between 40 and 250 meters. Most of Ruach Planitia is surrounded by a single bounding scarp, but on its east side the scarp appears to separate into two, giving a terraced profile.: 886  The floor of Ruach Planitia is generally flat, but may be subtly warped; given the limitations of Voyager 2 elevation data in the region, whether or not these are artifacts or true elevation features is uncertain. The central region of Ruach Planitia is significantly more varied in topography compared to much of Ruach Planitia's floor, with a large central pit—Dilolo Patera— nearly 10 km wide and roughly 350 m deep. Dilolo Patera is surrounded by a network of smaller pits, linear troughs, and scarps. The pit cluster at Ruach Planitia is similar to the pit clusters found within the other three walled plains of Triton, with only a single pit cluster with the largest pit at the center of the plains.: 894  Both Ruach Planitia and nearby Tuonela Planitia cut into the surrounding cantaloupe terrain, and Ruach Planitia cuts into the western regions of Cipango Planum.\nRuach Planitia's terraced appearance resembles that of terrestrial volcanic calderas, albeit at a very large scale. As with terrestrial calderas, eruptions from Ruach Planitia may have involved several distinct stages, with an early explosive stage of high-viscosity or high-volatility cryolava to form the terraced walls, with a later effusive stage that forms the flat floor.: 921  However, the crenulated appearance of the walls of Ruach Planitia do not appear to indicate collapse, and instead resemble eroded shorelines found on Earth. The multiple terraces on Ruach Planitia's eastern side may have arisen from compositional differences in different layers of Triton's crust, with some layers being more volatile than others. The flat floor of Ruach Planitia suggests that fluid cryolava infilled the depression, with the pits around Dilolo Patera acting as central vents whence material erupted from.: 870 : 219 \nThe terrain surrounding Ruach Planitia appears to be significantly modified, with apparent glaciation. The cliffs of both Ruach Planitia and Tuonela Planitia appear to have been significantly eroded, with the north wall of Ruach Planitia having apparently been breached in at least three sites. The breach connects to an apparent channel system that stretches for at least ~230 km, though it extends beyond Triton's terminator and into unimaged regions. It remains uncertain on which direction fluids may have flown within the channel, though tentative deposit features on the north floor of Ruach Planitia may indicate that material flowed into the plains, depositing eroded material onto the floor. Several smaller subcircular depressions are located nearby Ruach Planitia to the south and southwest; these subcircular depressions may be of cryovolcanic origin or from diapirism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTuonela Planitia – Walled plain on Triton\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tuonela Planitia is an elongated plain and probable cryolava lake on Neptune's moon Triton. Located in Triton's northern hemisphere within Monad Regio, it overlies part of Triton's unusual cantaloupe terrain. As with neighboring Ruach Planitia and other walled plains on Triton, Tuonela Planitia is among the youngest features on Triton's surface.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nTuonela Planitia was discovered alongside Triton's other surface features by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby of the Neptune system on 25 August 1989. The name Tuonela Planitia was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1991; the name originates from the Underworld realm of the dead from Finnish mythology.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nOf the four observed major walled plains on the surface of Triton, Tuonela Planitia is by far the largest. In contrast to neighboring Ruach Planitia, which is roughly circular in shape, Tuonela Planitia is significantly elongated. Its longest axis of roughly 400 km is nearly thrice longer than its short axis of roughly 150 km, and its longest axis is aligned roughly north to south. Tuonela Planitia's alignment may be tectonically controlled, although north–south trending tectonic features are usually found closer to Triton's equator.: 905  Its floor is broadly flat, though its surface may be slightly warped; the low quality of Voyaer 2 elevation data in the region makes it uncertain as to whether or not the warping is a real topographical feature or an artifact. The depressed floor of Tuonela Planitia is bound by a single scarp with a crenulated profile; the scarp appears to superficially resemble coastlines on Earth, with alcoves, bay-like features, and numerous \"islands\" rising 100–250 meters above the floor of Tuonela Planitia.: 886, 888  As with Ruach Planitia and the two other major walled plains of Triton, Tuonela Planitia hosts an unusual cluster of pits within its flat plains,: 893  though the pits of Tuonela Planitia are located within its northern \"lobe\". The largest pit in Tuonela Planitia has a low dome centered within it, rising some 200 meters above its surrounding moat. Tuonela Planitia cuts into the older cantaloupe terrain, indicating that it (along with other walled plains) is one of the youngest features on Triton's surface.: 939 \nLike Ruach Planitia, it has been hypothesized that Tuonela Planitia represents a massive basin infilled with cryolava. The pit clusters within the walled plains like Tuonela Planitia have been compared to volcanic vents or drainage pits, and they may represent sites whence material erupted from.: 870 : 219  As with terrestrial calderas on Earth, the eruptive history of Tuonela Planitia may have occurred in multiple stages, with an early stage of explosive eruptions involving high-viscosity or high-volatility material that clears a caldera,  later transitioning into a stage of effusive eruption that fills the basin with cryolava.: 921, 940  The shoreline-like profile of Tuonela Planitia's walls indicate that they may have been eroded by fluid sitting within the basins for extended periods of time, and the surrounding smooth terrain may represent sites of viscous cryolava flows or cryoclastic deposits.: 921  However, Tuonela Planitia's walls do not appear to resemble the collapse scarps of typical calderas.: 870 \nBoth Tuonela Planitia and Ruach Planitia appear to have bounding scarps that were subsequently modified by erosive processes, carving channels and valleys into their faces. In particular, Tuonela Planitia's eastern wall is host to a system of short, dense, narrow channels that may have been carved by glacial activity. Other features of probable cryovolcanic origin also lie close to Tuonela Planitia, such as a number of pitted cones south of the plain. These pitted cones are roughly conical hills with central depressions, superficially resembling terrestrial and lunar cinder cones.: 922 \n\n\n== See also ==\nRuach Planitia – Walled plain on Triton\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sthyr & Kjær was a grocery wholesaler based in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1978, it was merged with another firm under the name Dagros (after another merger renamed Dagrofa). Since 1970, its former headquarters at the corner of Rådhusstræde and Magstræde has housed the Huset KBH cultural centre (formerly known as \"Huset i Magstræde\")).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe company was founded on 2 August 1866 by Selgen Sthyr (1837–1922) amd P. B. Kjær (1835–1911). They knew each other from Adolph's trading firm where they had both worked.\nThe company was initially mostly involved in the sugar trade. It bought almost all the sugar that Moses & Søn G. Melchior imported from the Danish West Indies.\nIm 1875, Selgen Sthyr's brother P. C. A. Sthyr (1835–1916) became a partner. In 1881, Sthyr & Kjær bought the property at Rådhusstræde 13 and made it its new headquarters. It also owned the Niels Brock House on Strandgade in Christianshavn.\nIn 1893, P. B. Kjær retired from the firm. In 1894, Selgen Sthyr's  son Hans Hald Sthyr (1868–1944) became a partner.\nIn 1888, Sthyr & Kjær established a washing soda factory. In 1896, it became part of Akts. Sodafabrikkerne. In 1896, together with Moses & Søn G. Melchior, Sthyr & Kjær established Maribo Sugar Factory on Lolland. In 1898. it was taken over by De Danske Sukkerfabrikker. In 1899, Sthyr & Kjær also established a potato flour factory at Holstebro. It was later converted into a sugar factory. It was destroyed by fire in 1912. It was subsequently moved to Copenhagen where it was continued as  A/S Kbh.s Sukkerraffinaderier.\nIn 1913, P. C. A. Sthyr left the firm. In 1919 Sthyr & Kjær was converted into a limited company with Hald Sthyr as chairman\nBy the 1920s, Sthyr & Kjær was one of the largest grocery wholesalers in Denmark. The company was the principal supplier of the retail chains CENTRA and SPAR.\nIm 1978, Sthyr & Kjær was taken over by Lund & Rasmussen and continued as Dagros. The company was later merged with Brdr. Justesen and continued as Dagrofa.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1969, Copenhagen Municipality bought Stgyr & Kjær's former headquarters at Rpdhusstræde 13. It was subsequently converted into a cultural centre, known simply as Huset i Magstræde (\"The House in Magstræde\"). In the late 1990s, it housed a theatre known as Teater Shyr & Kjær. Selger Sthyr is one of the men seen on Peder Severin Krøyer's monumental 1894 oil-on-canvas group portrait painting From Copenhagen Stock Exchange.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bute Docks Feeder is a canal in Cardiff, Wales, constructed to provide a water source for the Cardiff docks.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn July 1830 an Act was passed by King William IV allowing the Marquis of Bute to construct the Bute Ship Canal, a mile-long body of water connecting the sea to the Glamorganshire Canal. The Ship Canal was to be supplied with water via a feeder canal diverted from the River Taff, half a mile north of Cardiff Castle and running through the town. The feeder canal took about five years to complete, in the run up to the completion of the new dock in 1839 (in 1835 it was reported to have already been extended past Cardiff Castle and into the Crockherbtown area of town).\nThe Bute East Dock was completed in 1859, with the dock feeder extended in the 1850s to provide water for the new dock.\nThe Corporation Baths were built on Guildford Crescent in 1862, whose swimming pools drew 1 million gallons of water from the dock feeder, which ran alongside it.\nIn 1945, Cardiff Corporation applied for permission to culvert over the dock feeder between Queen Street and Bute Terrace, which would create a wide new road - named Churchill Way in 1949 after the work had been completed.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe feeder canal is diverted from the River Taff at Blackweir and follows a three and half mile route from this point to its destination at the Cardiff docks.\nThe canal provides approximately 50 million gallons of water each day to keep the docks full.\n\n\n== Churchill Way Canal Quarter ==\n\nPlans were underway in 2022 to create a 'Canal Quarter' in the east of Cardiff city centre, with work was carried out to uncover the feeder canal in Churchill Way. Sixty-nine of the concrete beams were removed from above the canal, creating a new leisure area around the stretch of canal, which was officially opened in November 2023.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Devonport & Lake Takapuna Tramway was a 1-mile (1.6 km) horse tramway system in Auckland, New Zealand that operated between Victoria Wharf in Devonport to Cheltenham Beach from 1886 to 1888. It was the only commercial horsetram system to run on Auckland's North Shore.\n\n\n== Incorporation and construction ==\nThe idea of a tramway between Devonport and Lake Pupuke to increase the marketability of real estate along the proposed route had first been proposed by the Devonport Steam Ferry Company in 1883. Though the ferry company did not pursue their proposal, a group of Devonport businessmen took the concept and incorporated the Devonport and Lake Takapuna Tramway Company, Ltd., on 19 August 1885. The original proposal was to build five sections:\n\nSection 1: Victoria Wharf to Cheltenham Beach\nSection 2: Victoria Wharf to Takapuna Wharf and Northcote School.\nSection 3: Victoria Wharf to Narrow Neck Beach\nSection 4: Victoria Wharf to Stanley Bay\nSection 5: a connection between sections 1 and 3 along Tainui Road or Oxford Terrace\nThe sale of shares was low forcing the company to prioritise the construction of Section 1.\nCousins and Atkin Carriage Factory assembled the two horse-powered tramcars. These were designed in such a way that the horse could be attached to either end and the seats could be reversed, eliminating the need for a turntable. The tramcars were delivered to Devonport on 29 April 1886. Bolton and Walsh began construction on the line in late March 1886 after several bureaucratic and technical delays. The road was completed in 8 July but testing revealed several faults and it was not certified until 19 July. Since it was the middle of winter, the company decided to delay the opening of the line until September.\n\n\n== The route ==\nThe tramway began commercial operations on 25 September 1886. In addition to its termini, the tramway route had two stops, one at the head of Devonport Wharf at the bottom of Church Street, and another in the vicinity of Devonport Domain and Jubilee Avenue. A carbarn and horse paddock was also erected on Eton Avenue, accessible via a spur down Tainui Road. A planned passing siding may have been built near the halfway point of the line, but there is no contemporary evidence for it. A request to build a passenger ticket booth at the foot of Victoria Wharf was denied by the Auckland Harbour Board, so all tickets were sold by the conductor on the tram.\n\n\n== Operational years and abandonment ==\n\nThe Devonport tramway was never profitable. It ran for less than five months continuously, during which time it reduced fares twice. Meanwhile, increasingly expensive lawsuits were levied against the company in late 1886 and early 1887, undercutting the company's profits. On 8 February 1887, the company was given a court order to close. The franchise was listed for sale to recoup costs and Robert and Richard Duder acquired it on 28 March. Robert Duder had served as a provisional director on the company's board before it was incorporated and it is likely both were investors.\nFor the next year, the Duders ran a reduced seasonal service on the line, closing during the winter months and sending the horses out to graze on Browns Island. In June 1888, the Duders petitioned the Devonport Borough Council to suspend service for the winter, but it was never resumed. Repeated attempts by the borough to reinstate the service or have the tracks removed went nowhere, and the Duders failed to maintain the right-of-way despite demands and threats that they would lose the franchise if they did not do so. In September 1894, the Foreman of Works requested the tracks be removed and the borough council financed the task. The franchise was formally terminated on 19 December 1894, transferring the tramway rights back to the borough council.\nThe tracks were removed in late December 1894 and in many places Beach Road, now King Edward Parade, was widened to absorb the former right-of-way. The rails were sold to the Michelson Timber Company near Aoroa south of Dargaville. The tramcars were abandoned beside the old carbarn on Eton Avenue. They were eventually removed and the property redeveloped around 1909.\n\n\n== Later attempts ==\nIn 1898, Paul Hansen and William Napier obtained permission from the Waitemata County Council and the Borough of Devonport to build an electric tramway north from Devonport to a loop around Lake Pupuke. Hansen travelled to London to find recruit financiers for the venture, eventually persuading the British Electric Traction Company to fund it. However, this company was more interested in building an electric tramway system in Auckland City. Hansen acquired the franchise rights from William Gentry Bingham and the rights-of-way currently used by a horsetram system from Max Epstein. In March 1899, The Auckland Electric Tramways Company was formed, but nothing was announced about Devonport. Hansen requested two extensions from the Devonport Borough Council, the second of which in November 1900 was denied. The franchise rights reverted to the borough, although Napier fought for years to regain the franchise.\nFollowing Hansen's failure, the borough council attached a £500 deposit to any future attempt to acquire the franchise rights for a tramway. Napier refused to pay, but in 1906, Edward Robert Nolan Russell, a solicitor, put down a deposit. Unlike previous attempts, Russell planned to keep his tramway network within the borough boundaries. The proposed route included branches to Narrow Neck, Stanley Bay, Cheltenham Beach, and the Takapuna Race Track. Russell also pledged to install electrical lighting throughout the borough. Had it been built, the route would have likely connected with the Takapuna Tramways & Ferry Company's system, which would run between Bayswater and Milford from 1910 to 1927. Russell acquired sufficient funds to incorporate on 28 July 1908 as the Devonport Transport Company. However, the new Tramways Act 1908 required a vote by ratepayers to build any municipal tram system. On 18 January 1909, residents voted overwhelmingly against construction of the tramway.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPublic transport in Auckland\nPublic transport in New Zealand\nList of town tramway systems in Oceania\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nA blank stock certificate for the Devonport & Lake Takapuna Tramway Company, 1886, Auckland Council Libraries.\nA woman and girl sitting beside the Devonport tramway tracks, ca 1886, Auckland Council Libraries.",

        "content": "The Battle of Iller River or Battle of Erolzheim (5 June 1800) saw a French Republican army led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau fight a Habsburg Austrian army led by Paul Kray. In late May, the adversaries reached a stalemate with the Austrian army holding Ulm and the French army facing it from the south. Both armies numbered about 80,000 men. Kray launched an attack against the French left wing along the Iller River at Erolzheim and Illertissen, but he withdrew his troops when Moreau sent reinforcements. The action occurred during the War of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. \nThe Iller River flows north past Memmingen, Erolzheim, and Illertissen in southern Germany and enters the Danube at Ulm. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Forces and plans ===\nAt the start of 1800, Paul Kray commanded the Austrian army in southern Germany. Kray enhanced his reputation by winning the Battle of Magnano in 1799. According to James R. Arnold, Kray commanded 120,000 troops, though 25,000 of these were posted farther east to defend the Tyrol and Vorarlberg. One liability was that several allied contingents were less than first-class value, including 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 7,000 Tyrolean militia, 6,000 soldiers from the Duchy of Württemberg, and 5,000 militia from the Electorate of Mainz. The Aulic Council planned for the Austrian army in Italy to strike first, forcing the French to weaken their army on the Rhine River. Kray would then cross the Rhine and invade France via the Belfort gap. Meanwhile, Kray distributed his troops in a 170 mi (274 km) long cordon defense. One weakness of Kray's position was the magazine that he established at Stockach was very close to French-held Switzerland. Another flaw was that the Austrian army's supply services began to break down due to dissension among his staff, leading to low morale and a spike in desertions. Historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge claimed that Kray's army numbered 110,000 infantry, 25,000 cavalry, and 4,000 artillerists with 500 guns. \nOn 1 March 1800, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte of the new French Consulate government ordered Moreau to reorganize his army into four corps. Moreau's Army of the Rhine got the best soldiers and was well supplied. The Right Corps was led by Claude Lecourbe and the Center Corps was commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Each contained three large infantry divisions and a small reserve. The Left Corps was under Gilles-Joseph-Martin Bruneteau Saint-Suzanne and included two medium and two small divisions. The Reserve Corps was led by Moreau and had three large divisions and a small cavalry reserve. Altogether, Moreau's army counted 89,585 infantry, 14,065 cavalry, and 4,000 artillerists. Switzerland was garrisoned by 8,234 soldiers and the Rhine fortresses were held by 16,758 men. Moreau rejected a bold strategy proposed by Bonaparte. Instead, Moreau planned to feint with his Left Corps and cross the Rhine at Basel with the Reserve. He would then march east, join with the Center and Right Corps, and confront Kray near Stockach.\n\n\n=== Operations ===\nKray's 25,000-man left wing under Heinrich XV, Prince Reuss of Greiz held the Vorarlberg. The Austrian center led by Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf numbered 40,000 men and was deployed from Donaueschingen to Villingen. It held an outpost line on the Rhine River from Basel to Lake Constance. The right wing consisted of Michael von Kienmayer's 15,000 men holding the Black Forest and Anton Sztáray's 16,000 soldiers defending the Rhine north of the Black Forest. A 20,000-strong reserve was posted near Stockach and 8,000 men held Frankfurt. There was an entrenched camp and a major supply base at Ulm. \nOn 25 April 1800, Saint-Suzanne's Left Corps thrust out of its bridgehead at Kehl and drove Kienmayer's forces back. It then turned northeast and advanced toward Rastatt, which was defended by Sztáray's corps. Saint-Cyr's Center Corps crossed to the east bank of the Rhine at Alt-Breisach, pushed back Ignaz Gyulai's division, and seized Freiburg im Breisgau. Kray reacted by ordering 7,000 troops to reinforce Kienmayer. Having drawn Kray's attention away from Moreau's main attack, Saint-Suzanne withdrew to the west bank of the Rhine at Strasbourg. His corps marched upstream, crossed the Rhine at Alt-Breisach, and marched from Freiburg to Neustadt. Saint-Cyr's corps moved southeast through the Black Forest from Freiburg toward Sankt Blasien. \n\nLecourbe's Right Corps crossed the Rhine between Schaffhausen and Stein am Rhein and headed for Stockach. Moreau's Reserve Corps crossed the Rhine at Basel and advanced toward Engen where he planned to join with Saint-Cyr's corps. Kray reacted by canceling the reinforcement to Kienmayer. Kray suddenly realized that his Stockach magazine was threatened, but it was too late. The Battles of Stockach and Engen occurred on 3 May 1800. At Engen, the two armies fought to a draw, but at Stockach, 20,000 French troops faced 12,000 Austrians. Lecourbe defeated Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont and captured the Stockach supply base, causing Kray to withdraw north to Messkirch. The Battle of Messkirch on 5 May was stoutly contested between 50,000 French and 40,000 Austrians. That night, Kray retreated north to Sigmaringen where he crossed to the north bank of the Danube on 6 May. \n\nKray moved to the northeast, crossed to the south bank of the Danube at Riedlingen, and marched east to protect his magazine at Biberach. While Moreau was with Saint-Suzanne's Left Corps, Saint-Cyr with 25,000 men defeated Kray with 20,000 troops at the Battle of Biberach on 9 May. The supply base fell into French hands and Kray retreated to Ulm. On 10 May, some French elements reached the Iller River at Memmingen. At about this time, Lazare Carnot delivered the orders of the French government to detach a strong reinforcement to Italy, so 15,000 troops were sent under Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey. This left Moreau and Kray with about 80,000 men each. On 13 May, Moreau's Right, Reserve, and Center Corps crossed to the east bank of the Iller at Memmingen.  \nOn 14 May 1800, Saint-Suzanne's corps arrived at Erbach an der Donau on the north bank of the Danube near Ulm. Kray attacked Saint-Suzanne, but when Saint-Cyr marched back west and appeared on the south bank, Kray suspended the operation. The Austrian commander thus passed up an opportunity to maul Saint-Suzanne's corps. On 25 May, Moreau sent Lecourbe's Right Corps to occupy Augsburg and brought Saint-Suzanne's Left Corps to the south bank of the Danube. This extended the French across a 60 mi (97 km) front. By doing so, Moreau hoped to tempt Kray into coming out to fight. However, Kray would not take the bait and stayed in his entrenched camp at Ulm. Moreau seemed unable to maneuver Kray out of Ulm. Moreau wrote to Bonaparte, admitting that he and Kray, \"were fumbling against one another.\" Unhappy with Moreau's leadership, Saint-Cyr resigned his command, pleading bad health. On the Austrian side, morale was low because of Kray's lack of success. \n\n\n== Battle ==\n\nMoreau reorganized his army, sending Saint-Suzanne and one of his division commanders, Joseph Souham, to the lower Rhine to take charge of reserve troops. Antoine Richepanse assumed command of Saint-Suzanne's corps which became the flying left wing. Paul Grenier took charge of Saint-Cyr's corps, which was now the left wing. Moreau took personal control of the center and reserve. Lecourbe retained command of the right wing and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor took control of the flying right wing in Switzerland. On 5 June, Kray mounted an attack against Richepanse's flying left wing. \n\nKray placed Ludwig Anton, Count Baillet de Latour in command of the third attacking column. It consisted of 8 infantry battalions and 10 cavalry squadrons. Baillet's column successfully ousted Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc's French brigade from Balzheim and Wain on the west bank of the Iller. However, Moreau quickly sent Richepanse reinforcements. Michel Ney's French division from Grenier's corps attacked Count Baillet's division and forced it to retreat after sustaining serious losses. In the Battle of Erolzheim, Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este commanded the main column of 23 battalions and 26 squadrons, but \"was not favored by the luck of arms\". Johann Rudolf von Spork, who commanded the reserve, was captured by a French patrol while carrying out a personal reconnaissance.\nKray ordered a withdrawal after the French reinforcements arrived on the field. Out of 55,000 infantry and 2,780 cavalry, the French sustained losses of 700 killed and wounded plus 300 captured. The Austrians engaged 28,000 troops in the battle and lost 800 killed and wounded plus 1,100 men and 4 guns captured.  \n\n\n== Notes ==\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== References ==\nArnold, James R.

        "content": "Secrets of the Octopus is a nature documentary television series that depicts a variety of octopus species in a variety of habitats. The first episode aired April 21, 2024, on National Geographic, with all three episodes being released the following day on Disney+ and Hulu to celebrate Earth Day. Executive produced by James Cameron, it is the third series in his Secrets of franchise, preceded by Secrets of the Whales, and Secrets of the Elephants.\nThe octopuses were filmed in their natural habitat over 200 days by the production team.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nSecrets of the Octopus explores the life, culture, and behavior of different octopus species across the globe. Featuring narration by actor Paul Rudd, and commentary and discussion by a number of marine biologists, scientists, and experts in the field, the documentary series seeks to bring viewers closer than ever to one of the planet's most elusive and alien creatures.\n\n\n=== Featured octopuses ===\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nSecrets of the Octopus was announced on February 2, 2022, alongside twelve other National Geographic series as part of their streaming deal with Disney+, including its predecessor Secrets of the Elephants.\nFollowing the previous iterations of the Secrets of franchise, which focused on whales and elephants respectively, executive producer James Cameron spoke about his excitement at exploring the world of octopuses, noting that he studied marine biology in the early 1970s, and was particularly fascinated by the discoveries that were being made about the octopus at the time. Speaking about the inspiration for the series, Cameron explained “I’ve always held the octopus in very high regard as a science fiction writer. I always imagined that when that flying saucer lands on the White House lawn and the ramp comes down, it’s going to be something that looks like an octopus that comes out. The beauty of this octopus series is they live relatively shallow, and you can pretty much do your work on scuba. This is about human patience and human understanding and creating. In the case of Dr. Alex Schnell, for example, who is our featured marine scientist, it’s about creating a bond with individual animals of these different species and just observing them, then applying some science to interpret what you’re seeing.”\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAhead of its premiere, The Guardian highlighted Secrets of the Octopus as one of the best seven shows to watch that week, stating \"the octopus clearly becomes more fascinating the closer to it you get. It’s a beautifully shot and at times genuinely psychedelic insight into an otherworldly realm.\" In a positive review, Tony Bradley of Forbes wrote \"A significant portion of the series is dedicated to capturing behaviors never before filmed, offering viewers an unprecedented look at how octopuses interact with their environment and other species. This includes their unique reproductive strategies, where female octopuses sacrifice their lives for the next generation, and their ability to \"think\" with their arms, each of which has a mind of its own. Paul Rudd's narration adds a layer of warmth and humanity to the series, inviting viewers to connect deeply with the narrative. His enthusiasm for the subject matter is palpable, as he expresses awe and admiration for the octopuses' capabilities and the scientists who study them.\"\nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson praised the cinematography, calling the series \"visually stunning\" and noting that \"the information is fascinating, but the movement, the colors and the precision of the photography are exhilarating. So are the moments apparently never before captured: the actual mating process, and the use of a clam shell for self-defense. The terrestrial participants in the show are beside themselves. Their enthusiasm is infectious.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSecrets of the Octopus at IMDb",

        "content": "Christopher Reed (born February 25, 1947) is a New Zealand-educated, American professor emeritus and inorganic chemist known for his contributions to synthetic and structural chemistry across the periodic table, particularly his discovery of the strongest known acid.\nHe is a fellow of The Royal Society of Chemistry, the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nReed was born in Auckland, New Zealand to English parents, Mick and Sylvia Reed, and educated at Dilworth School.\nHe obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from The University of Auckland in 1967, followed by a Master of Science with First Class Honors in 1969. His master's thesis was Nitrosyl Complexes of Iridium, done under the mentorship of Warren R. Roper.\nIn 1971, Reed completed his Ph.D. at The University of Auckland with his thesis on Oxidative Addition Reactions of Low-Valent Complexes of Iridium, again under the guidance of Warren R. Roper.\nDuring 1971–1973, he did postdoctoral research on picket fence porphyrin models for hemoglobin at Stanford University with James P. Collman.\n\n\n== Career ==\nReed was an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1973. He was associate professor from 1979 to 1982 and Professor of Chemistry until 1998. During his tenure at USC, Reed served as the Head of the Division of Inorganic/Biological Chemistry from 1994 to 1998.\nIn 1998, he joined the University of California, Riverside (UCR) as a Distinguished Professor and was Director of the UCR Center for s and p Block Chemistry from 2005 until he retired as Emeritus Professor in 2012.\nReed held several visiting professorships at institutions worldwide, including the Centre d'Études Nucleaires de Grenoble, The University of Auckland, Monash University, Université de Rennes, Domaine Universitaire de Grenoble, University of Sydney, Oxford University, and Freie Universität Berlin.\n\n\n== Research and contributions ==\nReed's early work in collaboration with Robert Scheidt, led to an understanding of spin and oxidation state relationships in the structures of iron porphyrins and hemoproteins, as well as the development of new principles guiding spin-spin coupling mechanisms in copper dimers and metalloporphyrin radical cations.\nIn collaboration with Peter Boyd, Reed uncovered novel supramolecular interactions between porphyrins and fullerenes.\nReed's work on icosahedral carboranes opened up new avenues of research in the field of least coordinating anions, leading to the isolation of highly reactive cations such as t-butyl cation and controversially, silylium ions. Silylium ion chemistry has led to transformative developments in cationic catalysis.\nOne of Reed's most notable achievements was the synthesis of the strongest known acids, H(CHB11F11) and H(CHB11Cl11), surpassing the acidity of typical superacids based on SbF5. Paradoxically, these carborane acids are also the gentlest known acids, because their counterions are so inert.  This has allowed the isolation and structural characterization of reactive cations previously thought to be unstable, such as HC60+ and C59N+.\nReed's more recent work in collaboration with Evgenii Stoyanov, on one of the oldest problems in chemistry, the molecular structure of Haq+ in water, challenges conventional wisdom theories about the nature of acids in water. \nReed has written several essays on exploitative practices in the scientific literature.\n\n\n== Memberships and awards ==\nHe received Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, the USC Associates Award for Creativity in Research and Scholarship, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, the Tolman Award from the Southern California Section of the ACS, and the F. Albert Cotton ACS Award in Synthetic Inorganic Chemistry.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n“Myths about the Proton. The Nature of H+ in Condensed Media” C. A. Reed, Acc. Chem.

This right of disposal (dispositionsrätt), still in effect, was enacted during the period when the Swedish Constitution of 1809 was worked out, where the king lost income and other powers.\nProperties thus placed at the disposal of the monarch are owned by the State of Sweden, administered by the Office of the Steward  (Ståthållarämbetet) of the Royal Court of Sweden and managed by the National Property Board of Sweden, with the exception of   Djurgården with Rosendal Palace which is under special royal management (Kungliga Djurgårdens Förvaltning). It has been asserted that, through the Royal Right of Disposal, a part of the old absolute monarchy from before 1809 is still intact and that this is contrary to Swedish democracy in general.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nembo (\"Nimbus\") was the lead ship of the Italian Nembo-class destroyers. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") in 1902, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was sunk during the latter conflict in October 1916.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\nNembo was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, on 6 August 1899. She was launched on 18 May 1901 and completed on 26 June 1902. She was commissioned in June 1902. Nembo, like her sister ship, Turbine, had her armament modified in 1905, each having her Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 gun removed and two additional 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes installed, giving them the same armament as that of the following three Nembo-class ships.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Nembo′s took place in 1909. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. In 1914–1916 Nembo underwent additional modifications, receiving equipment that allowed her to lay 10 to 16 mines.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. Nembo was assigned at the time to the 2nd Squadron's 4th Division along with her sister ships Aquilone, Borea, and Turbine. On 17 April 1912 she suffered damage in a collision with Turbine, but not enough to prevent her from joining Turbine, the armored cruisers Francesco Ferruccio, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Varese, and Vettor Pisani, the torpedo cruiser Coatit, and the torpedo boats Climene, Pegaso, Perseo, and Procione in a bombardment of the Ottoman forts of Gum-Galesch and Sed Ul Bahr in the Dardanelles on 18 April 1912. On 4 May 1912, Nembo and Aquilone occupied the island of Lipsos in the Dodecanese in the Aegean Sea.\nAt 04:00 on 14 July 1912, Nembo got underway from Stampalia in the Dodecanese with Borea and Vettor Pisani to provide support to the torpedo boats Astore, Centauro, Climene, Perseo, and Spica as they conducted a reconnaissance of the Dardanelles. The ships first steamed to the Italian-occupied island of Leros in the southern Aegean Sea, where the torpedo boats were prepared for the incursion. They then proceeded to Strati (also known as Bozaba), where they arrived on 17 July 1912 and the officer who would command the torpedo boats during the operation joined the force. Delayed by bad weather, the force left Strati on the afternoon of 18 July bound for the Dardanelles. While Nembo, Vettor Pisani, and Borea remained off the coast out of sight of land, the torpedo boats penetrated the Dardanelles, noting the location of Ottoman ships and the defenses of the strait. Suffering only slight damage and no casualties, the torpedo boats returned to Vettor Pisani during the predawn hours of 19 July 1912. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915–1916 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Nembo, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Sorrentino, as well as Aquilone, Borea, Turbine, and their sister ship Espero made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto.\nOn 23 June 1916 Nembo and the French Navy destroyer Casque, later joined by the French destroyer Protet and four Italian torpedo boats, took part in rescuing the survivors of the Italian auxiliary cruiser Città di Messina and the French destroyer  Fourche, torpedoed and sunk by the Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine U-15 while on a reconnaissance cruise in the Strait of Otranto. Rescuers saved 302 of the 335 men who had been aboard Città di Messina and 66 of the 85 men who had been aboard Fourche.\nIn October 1916 Nembo, Borea, the destroyers Ascaro and Garibaldino, and four torpedo boats provided protection and support to a landing force consisting of Francesco Ferruccio and the steamers Ausonia, Bulgaria, Choising, and Polcevera sent to occupy Sarandë (known to the Italians as Santi Quaranta), in the Principality of Albania. At 05:15 on 2 October 1916, four platoons of sailors, a unit of miners, and a unit of personnel from Francesco Ferruccio landed on the beach and quickly occupied the area, the 32 members of the Greek garrison at Sarandë having no option other than to retreat after protesting the Italian operation. After disembarking an infantry battalion and a cavalry squadron, the steamers departed at 16:00 on 2 October for Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona), Albania, where they embarked more troops. On 3 October, Ausonia and Polcevera landed a pack artillery battery and a second cavalry squadron, and on 4 October the operation was completed when Bulgaria and Choising put another infantry battalion and a third cavalry squadron ashore.\n\n\n==== Loss ====\nOn 16 October 1916 Nembo, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Russo, left Vlorë to escort the steamer Bormida, which was bound for Sarandë with troops on board. On 17 October, between Vlorë and Sazan (known to the Italians as Saseno) the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-16 attacked the convoy, hitting Nembo with two torpedoes. Nembo broke in two and sank quickly at 40°08′N 019°30′E. U-16 also sank during the clash, although how and why she sank is unclear: According to some sources Nembo rammed U-16 before sinking, while other sources claim that Nembo′s depth charges sank U-16 when they exploded after falling overboard while Nembo sank. Still other sources claim that U-16 sank after colliding with Bormida.\nOf Nembo′s 55-man crew, 32 died in the sinking, including Russo, the executive officer, the chief engineer, and another engineering officer. Twenty-three men survived, either rescued by Italian ships or swimming to the Albanian coast. Among U-16′s crew, two men died and 14 survived. Of the Italians who survived by swimming to shore, four refused rescue by a lifeboat manned by U-16′s survivors so as to avoid being taken prisoner. After reaching the coast, they contributed to the capture of the Austro-Hungarians in the lifeboat, who were taken prisoner by Italian ships.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W.

        "content": "Scaralina marmorata is a species of planthopper in the family Fulgoridae, found throughout the southeastern United States. It is one of four species (the others being Scaralina aethrinsula, Scaralina cristata, and Scaralina metcalfi) that were, for several decades, erroneously grouped together under a single name, Alphina glauca; this name is now treated as a synonym of S. marmorata.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nHistorically, this species has been incorrectly associated with three other genera; the genus Calyptoproctus (which molecular DNA evidence suggests is not in the tribe Poiocerini), the genus Crepusia, a slightly more closely related genus from South America, and Alphina, a closely-related genus also from South America.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nScaralina marmorata is associated with oaks (Quercus spp.). It is the only species in the genus routinely found at elevations below 1000 meters.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nScaralina marmorata is found from central Texas up to Oklahoma and across to Virginia, and all areas south and east of this, wherever oaks are found.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On September 3 and 5, 2020, al-Shabaab militants attacked the village of Shabeelow in Galmudug, Somalia, sparking clashes with villagers who took up arms in self-defense.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFor years, the jihadist militant group al-Shabaab has launched incursions into the village of Shabeelow, pressuring residents to wage jihad against the Somali government and turn over their livestock to al-Shabaab. In response to the constant attacks, residents of Shabeelow had taken up arms to fight against the jihadists. In March 2020, al-Shabaab ordered residents of the village to provide children to fight for the group. Tensions had reportedly risen between the two groups in the days prior to the battle, but these confrontations had no injuries or fatalities.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nClashes broke out between villagers and al-Shabaab on September 3 after the latter attempted to force villagers to hand over their livestock. When the villagers refused, al-Shabaab placed landmines in and around the village. Villagers who had taken up arms along with nearby freelance militiamen fought back against the jihadists, sparking the clashes. The fighting had a brief lull on September 4 before flaring up later that night and into September 5. The clashes on September 5 lasted for five hours, and left sixteen jihadists and fourteen villagers and militiamen dead. At least six militiamen and villagers were injured as well, and subsequently transported to hospitals in Galkayo.\nBy September 5, the Somali military's 21st and 15th Battalions headed to Shabeelow to evacuate the injured and dispel al-Shabaab. al-Shabaab claimed that nine Galmudug State Forces militiamen had been killed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vault-Tec Corporation, otherwise known as Vault-Tec and sometimes called Vault-Tec Industries, is a fictional defense megacorporation from the post-apocalyptic Fallout franchise. Throughout the United States, Vault-Tec created government-funded vaults, large fallout shelters that would serve to shelter civilians and allow for the continuation of human life in the threat of a nuclear attack. Within most of these Overseer-governed vaults, Vault-Tec carried out human experiments on its residents without their consent or knowledge, ranging from being mostly harmless to disturbing and inhumane.\n\n\n== Concept and design ==\nVault-Tec is a pre-war defense megacorporation responsible for creating the vaults featured throughout the Fallout series. Their purpose of conducting human experiments on its residents began as an idea by Fallout co-creator Tim Cain following the 1997 release of the first Fallout game. Despite its slogan \"revolutionizing safety for an uncertain future,\" Vault-Tec is consistently portrayed as a corrupt, unscrupulous corporation with themes of unfettered capitalism.\n\n\n=== Vaults ===\nVault-Tec created vaults throughout the United States with the help of government funding. These vaults served as large fallout shelters used to house civilians and allow for human life to continue in the potentiality of the U.S. being in immediate threat of a nuclear attack. These vaults were Overseer-governed, with Vault-Tec carrying out human experiments on its residents without their consent or knowledge, which ranged from being mostly harmless to inhumane and disturbing. In total, Vault-Tec created 122 vaults, 17 of which, being \"control vaults,\" or vaults not made for human experimenting purposes. Vault-Tec made revenue through selling reserved spots in these vaults. In order to market themselves, Vault-Tec made various products such as lunchboxes and bobbleheads.\n\n\n== Technology and identity ==\nThe Pip-Boy, a wearable computer by RobCo Industries, was initially made for pre-war and vault-living use, with many of the device's settings used for inhabitants of Vault-Tec's vaults due to the Pip-Boy being issued to each dweller. The Pip-Boy's useful functionalities have also allowed for it to be used in the wasteland. Fallout 4 features two games created by Vault-Tec that are playable on a Pip-Boy, one of which, titled Red Menace, being a propaganda game against China.\nVault-Tec created V.A.T.S., or the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, a special combat system introduced in Fallout 3 and featured throughout the series. The combat system allows for the player to target the specific limb of an enemy based on chance. Fallout 76 features technology created by Vault-Tec such as portable C.A.M.P.S., and G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) devices.\nVault-Tec's identity is highly represented by Vault Boy, the corporation mascot.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nThe first of Vault-Tec's creations appeared in the first Fallout game, where the player originates from Vault 13, one of many created by Vault-Tec. Although Vault-Tec's concept of conducting human experiments wasn't yet developed, Vault 13 still had remnants of the yet-existent concept as the Overseers were tasked with keeping its residents in the vault no matter what, for as long as possible.\nVault-Tec's lore formulized with the release of Fallout 2, in which Cain described one of vaults as being a \"control vault,\" explaining it as giving the company \"a purpose beyond just 'let's save some of the American population then release them back into a radioactive dead zone.'\"\nIn Fallout 4, the player is guided through a tutorial sequence where they enter Vault 111 and, as part of Vault-Tec's experiment within this vault, becoming cryogenically frozen for two centuries. The game also has features the Vault-Tec Workshop expansion pack, in which the player has the ability to construct and customize the initially-empty Vault 88.\nIn Fallout Shelter, the player builds and manages their own vault.\nIn Fallout 76, which takes place in West Virginia, the player is an inhabitant of Vault 76, one of the 17 \"control\" vaults. According to a log in Fallout 3, one of the workers for Vault 76, the assistant CEO of Vault-Tec, was kidnapped by aliens. Vault-Tec runs an institution in the area known as Vault-Tec University, which features a simulation vault for training purposes.\n\n\n=== Vault-Tec buildings and structures ===\nSome of Vault-Tec's buildings and structures have been featured throughout the series. The Vault-Tec Headquarters is landmark featured in Fallout 3, which takes place in Washington, D.C., and the Vault-Tec Regional HQ, Vault-Tec's headquarters in Boston, is a landmark in Fallout 4. Additionally, \"Among the Stars\" is a Vault-Tec amusement park attraction in the Fallout 4: Nuka-World expansion pack. The Vault-Tec University is also a landmark in Fallout 76. The Fallout television series also reveals that Vault-Tec has a headquarter building in California.\n\n\n=== Fallout show ===\n\nVault-Tec is featured in the 2024 television adaptation Fallout. It goes into more depth surrounding its pre-war corporate events, contributing heavily to the plot of the series. Four of their vaults were featured in the series: three neighboring vaults, Vault 33, Vault 32 and Vault 31, as well as Vault 4. Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), a dweller of Vault 33, leaves in search of her Overseer father Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan) who was kidnapped during a New California Republic (NCR) raid led by Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury). One of the earliest mentions of the corporation itself takes place in the second episode where Enclave-defector Siggi Wilzig (Michael Emerson) takes \"Vault-Tec Plan D,\" a cyanide pill which he described as \"the most humane product that Vault-Tec ever made.\" It becomes later revealed in the show that Vault-Tec, led by representative Barb Howard (Frances Turner), was proposing dropping nuclear bombs throughout the United States to initiate a nuclear war, allowing themselves to be the only ones left thanks to the Vaults. High-ranking employees of the corporation, including Hank, were cryogenically frozen inside of Vault 31, as discovered by Norm MacLean (Moisés Arias). It is also revealed that Hank dropped a nuclear bomb on the NCR's headquarters, Shady Sands, following the NCR's rise in political power over California.\nThe show featured an easter egg by providing a Vault-Tec phone number through an in-show advertisement casting actor and Vault-Tec spokesman Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), which viewers could actually contact.\n\n\n== Promotion and merchandise ==\n\nIn 2008, as part of a marketing campaign for Fallout 3, a collector's edition version of the game was released, which included a Vault-Tec lunch box. In 2019, a limited edition Vault-Tec themed computer case was released by NZXT, with a limited quantity of 1,000 units. The following year, Bethesda partnered with gaming chair company Noblechairs to release a Vault-Tec edition chair.\nFollowing the release of the 2024 Fallout series, Arizona Beverage Company released Fallout and Vault-Tec themed ice tea energy drinks. Gunnar Optiks also released Vault 33-themed eyeglasses.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nVault-Tec has been placed in several top-ranking lists for evil corporations within video games, including by The Guardian, GamesRadar+, PC Gamer, and TheGamer. Sarah Milner of Polygon described Vault-Tec as having \"little interest in saving the population – its corporate leadership was playing the long game, using the majority of the Vaults to conduct social experiments and scientific research, free from the restraints of regulations or ethics.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVault-Tec Corporation at The Vault, the Fallout wiki",

        "content": "Ignacio Jesús \"Chus\" Trujillo Cabrera (born 6 July 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer, and the manager of Terrassa FC.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTrujillo was born in Tenoya, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, and played for local side CA Tenoya before becoming manager of their Cadete squad in 2004. In 2007, after one year in charge of their Juvenil team, he moved to UD Las Palmas as an assistant of the Juvenil División de Honor squad and manager of the Juvenil C team.\nAhead of the 2009–10 season, Trujillo was named manager of CD Goleta in the Segunda Regional, leading the club to a promotion to the Primera de Aficionados in his first year, and to the Interinsular Preferente in 2013. Shortly after his second promotion, however, he was named at the helm of UD San Antonio also in the fifth tier.\nIn July 2014, Trujillo returned to Las Palmas after being announced as manager of the C-team also in division five. On 16 June 2016, he became Manolo Márquez's assistant at the reserves, but left the club in the following year, after Márquez was named in charge of the first team.\nOn 14 November 2017, Trujillo was appointed manager of Tamaraceite; he was already a technical secretary of the club since their refoundation in 2015. He led the club back to Tercera División after 34 years in his first season, and also won their group in his second, missing out promotion in the play-offs; he also renewed his contract with Támara in the process.\nDuring the curtailed 2019–20 season, Trujillo led Tamaraceite to the play-offs once again, achieving a first-ever promotion to Segunda División B, and extended his link for a further year on 20 August 2020. On 24 June 2021, after avoiding relegation, he left the club.\nOn 25 June 2021, a day after leaving Tamaraceite, Trujillo was named manager of Segunda División RFEF side AD Ceuta FC. He led the club to promotion to Primera Federación at the end of the campaign, but was sacked on 18 September 2022, after a winless start to the 2022–23 season.\nOn 4 October 2023, after more than a year without a club, Trujillo was appointed in charge of Terrassa FC also in the fourth division.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 28 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChus Trujillo manager profile at BDFutbol",

        "content": "Scaralina metcalfi is a species of planthopper in the family Fulgoridae. It is found from Arizona in the United States south to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is one of four species (the others being Scaralina aethrinsula, Scaralina cristata, and Scaralina marmorata) that were, for several decades, erroneously grouped together under a single name, Alphina glauca; this name is now treated as a synonym of S. marmorata.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nScaralina metcalfi typically occurs at higher elevations, above 1000 meters, and is associated with oaks (Quercus spp.). Of the three co-occurring species in the area where it is found, it is much rarer than the other two species, and may feed on a rarer host oak species.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nScaralina metcalfi is found in a subset of the Madrean Sky Islands in Arizona down into Chihuahua. In Arizona, its range is overlapped by the ranges of Scaralina aethrinsula and Scaralina cristata, and all three species can be found together.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lucas Fratzscher (born 6 July 1994) is a German biathlete. He is the winner of the overall IBU Cup standings for the 2019/20 season.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLucas Fratzscher grew up in Schleusingen. After initially practicing athletics, he started biathlon at the age of nine at WSV Oberhof 05. In 2007, he attended the Sports High School Oberhof, where he graduated in 2014. Since then, he has been a member of the sports promotion group of the Bundeswehr in the Rennsteig Barracks and is coached by Mark Kirchner and Marko Danz at the Thuringian Olympic Training Center in Oberhof.\nLucas Fratzscher competed in his first international races during the IBU Cup 2016/17 in Obertilliach. In the same winter, he also participated in the Biathlon European Championships, with a 13th place in the sprint in Martell being his best result of the season. In the following season, he couldn't improve this result. At the European Championships in Ridnaun, he once again missed out on the medal positions by a considerable margin.\n\n\n=== Season 2018/19 - First international successes and World Cup debut ===\nAt the German Championships in 2018, Fratzscher secured his first international starting position for the season with three fourth places. Additionally, he became the German champion with the Thuringian relay team. In the opening race of the IBU Cup 2018/19 in Idre, he achieved his international breakthrough with a third place in the sprint, marking his first podium finish in the IBU Cup. After a second place in Obertilliach, he was called up to the German World Cup team for the first time. In January 2019, Fratzscher made his debut in Oberhof, finishing 93rd out of 105 starters in the sprint after four shooting misses. Upon returning to the IBU Cup, he secured another second place. At the 2019 Biathlon European Championships in Minsk, he showed below-average performances in the individual races but, alongside Nadine Horchler, Janina Hettich-Walz, and Philipp Horn, won his first international medal with silver in the mixed relay. In the remaining IBU Cup season, he won his first individual race in Martell, achieving a German sweep in the sprint ahead of Philipp Horn and Danilo Riethmüller, and narrowly secured second place in the overall standings with a one-point lead over Aristide Bègue, thanks to several other top-10 finishes. As a result, he qualified for further World Cup appearances at the season finale in Oslo in March 2019. These races went significantly better than in Oberhof: he qualified for the mass start, achieved points in all three races, and secured two top-10 placements.\n\n\n=== Season 2019/20 - IBU Cup Overall Victory ===\nAt the German Championships in 2019, the Thuringian relay, including Fratzscher, repeated their success from the previous year. In the first race of the IBU Cup 2019/20 season, he secured his second career victory in the sprint in Sjusjøen. He also reached the podium in the two subsequent races there. At the next IBU Cup stop in Obertilliach, he finished second in the short individual race and won the single mixed relay together with Stefanie Scherer. Fratzscher entered the Christmas break as the clear leader in the overall standings and, like the previous year, was nominated for the World Cup in Oberhof in January, where he finished 86th with four shooting misses. Upon returning to the IBU Cup, he finished second with the German mixed relay in Osrblie. In February in Martell, he achieved three more individual podium finishes and two additional top-10 placements. The European Championships 2020, which were once again moved to Minsk at short notice, did not go as well for Fratzscher, as he failed to win any medals. However, at the subsequent IBU Cup finale at the same venue, he achieved results within the top ten in both sprints. With a 13th place in the final mass start, he defended his lead in the overall standings with just one point ahead of Endre Strømsheim and secured the big crystal globe. Additionally, he won the sprint standings. Consequently, he was nominated for the World Cup in Kontiolahti, where he failed to score points in both the sprint and pursuit. The subsequent season finale in Oslo was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Biathlon results ==\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\n\n\n=== World Cup ===\n\n\n=== European Championships ===\n5 medals (3 silver, 2 bronze)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLucas Fratzscher at IBU",

        "content": "Gateshead Association Football Club was a football club based in Gateshead, County Durham, England. The club was formed in South Shields in 1899 as South Shields Adelaide Athletic. After success in the North Eastern League prior to World War I, they were voted into the Football League in 1919. Financial problems in the late 1920s saw the club relocate to Gateshead in 1930, adopting the name of their new town. They remained in the Football League until 1960, when they were surprisingly voted out of the Football League and replaced by Peterborough United, despite not having had to apply for re-election since 1937. They subsequently played in regional leagues before folding in 1973. In order to replace them, another South Shields club was then moved to Gateshead, becoming Gateshead United.\n\n\n== Seasons ==\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Stuart, Mr. N.S. Harwood, Miss Sarah Harris, and Frank M. Hall.\nThe membership fee was $1. Mr. Harwood was the only president the club had during its twelve years of existence\n\n\n== Career ==\nHeld eight annual exhibitions over the years.\nAfter Cora Parker who was the head of the club in 1897 left, the university at the time was instituting an Art Department and in 1900 the club was expanded into the Nebraska Art Association.\nIn 2008 the Nebraska Art Association became the Sheldon Art Association, an association of the Sheldon Museum.\nThe connection between the Nebraska Art Association and the University of Nebraska Lincoln has survived since.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe club's first exhibition in 1888 of a single large painting found success and set a precedent for permanent exhibit spaces for other purchases within the University of Nebraska's art department. A relationship between the association and the university was sustained while exhibitions continued in the University Library Building, Morrill Hall, and finally in the Sheldon Gallery. The continuous efforts toward building an art scene by the artists in Lincoln led to the creation of art collections. A notable one was Mr. and Mrs. Frank M. Hall's which in 1928 was given to the university.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the son of Marcus Vettius Bolanus, consul in 66 AD, and Pontia, of the gens Petronia. He had a twin brother, Marcus Vettius Bolanus, consul in 111 AD. It is believed he was adopted by a member of the gens Claudia, whence the name.\nCrispinus began his political career during the Flavian dynasty. Under Emperor Domitian, he joined the Roman Senate, where he was until the reign of Emperor Trajan. He was known for his patronage of the poet Statius. Around 93 AD, his mother tried to poison him and his brother, failing and committing suicide shortly after. In 113 AD, he became consul together with Lucius Publilius Celsus as his colleague.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Yi Sun (孙毅) is a Chinese–American distinguished molecular biologist and oncologist, specialized in protein ubiquitylation and neddylation. He served as professor emeritus of Radiation Oncology at University of Michigan. He is the Qiushi Chair Professor at the 2nd Affiliated Hospital and Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.\nSun has published more than 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals with an H-index of 77 and over 38,500 citations. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) since 2012.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1982, Sun earned his M.D. degree at Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang, China, and continued at Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, obtaining his M.S. degree in biochemistry in 1985.\nHe went to US in 1986 and obtained his PhD in Radiation biology from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA in 1989. Thereafter, Sun spent 5 years at the National Cancer Institute as a postdoc fellow, later as a senior staff fellow from 1990 to 1995.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his tenure at the NCI, Sun spent 8 years in Parke-Davis/Pfizer as Research Fellow for cancer target identification and drug discovery in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nSun then joined the faculty of University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA in 2003, and was promoted to tenured full professor and Director of the Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology in 2008.\nHe retired from University of Michigan as a professor emeritus of Radiation Oncology in 2020.\nSun also served as the founding Dean at the Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University, China from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSun has research expertise in cancer biology, radiation oncology, and translational medicine, specialized in protein ubiquitylation and neddylation, and their role in cancer.\n\n\n=== SAG/RBX2 E3 ligase is a validated anti-cancer target ===\nSun cloned SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2, as an antioxidant protein, and a RING component of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), required for their activities; He and his team discovered that Sag is essential for mouse development, as well as for angiogenesis and apoptosis protection.  The team validated SAG as a target for anti-cancer drug discovery by demonstrating its promoting role during tumorigenesis in the lung, prostate, and pancreas; and its overexpression in human cancer tissues with positive correlation to poor survival of cancer patients.\n\n\n=== SAG-CRLs regulates many important biological processes via targeting degradation of key proteins ===\nSun and his team identified a number of key regulatory proteins as the substrates of CRLs that control a variety of important signal pathways and biological processes, particularly in growth and survival of cancer cells.  These substrates include DEPTOR, Nf1, c-Jun, IκBα, Erbin, NOXA, XRCC4, SHOC2, SKP2, β-Catenin, MSX2, ASCT2, and DIRAS-2, as well as procaspase-3, HIF-1α, p27, MFN1, and EGR1. Targeted inhibition of CRLs causes accumulation of the tumor suppressors to inhibit cancer cell growth and cancer development.\n\n\n=== Elucide neddylation function and discover neddylation inhibitors as novel anticancer agents ===\nSun and his team showed a cross-talk between two neddylation E2s, and neddylation E2/E3 regulated the functions of immune cells. The team also found that E1 inhibitor MLN4924 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to radiation; regulates stem cell proliferation and differentiation; and strikingly suppressed tumorigenesis in the lung and pancreas, triggered by mutant KrasG12D as a single agent.  The study in the lung tumorigenesis triggered an intensive collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutics, Inc., leading to an investigator-initiated Phase II clinical trials of MLN4924 (also known as pevonedistat) plus Docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In drug discovery side, Sun and his team discovered small molecule inhibitors of neddylation E1, and neddylation E2 UBE2F as well as UBE2M-DCN interactions in collaboration with S. Wang's team in University of Michigan.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nDuan, H., Wang, Y., Aviram, M., Swaroop, M., Loo, J. A., Bian, J., Tian, Y., Mueller, T., Bisgaier, C. L., and Sun, Y.

It is a regional landmark, known locally as \"The Mall\". Tutu Park Mall not only includes the mall building itself but the surround area. It contains over 60 stores. Kmart and Plaza Extra serve as anchor stores. Additionally, there is also a food court. Numerous fast food businesses can be found in the area. It also serves as a central gathering point for the local community. Parking is also available. It is located along U.S. Virgin Islands Highway 38. It is centrally located on the island.\nBecause of its location, it serves as a local transportation hub. \n\n\n== History ==\nWilliam Mahaffey and John Foster were the principal partners to start the mall. With other investors, they leased the property from the Hartland family. Prior to construction, the site of the mall was the site of an archaeological excavation. In September 1992, construction started and it was opened a year later. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

His debut season ended well after he participated in the Knockout Cup final and contributed to the winning side.\nThe following season he nearly won a second consecutive knockout cup with Berwick, reaching the final but losing to rivals Edinburgh Monarchs. In 1982, he then joined Edinburgh and improved his season average to 7.03.\nSaunders became a regular with Edinburgh and also emerged as a fan's favourite, improving his season average to 7.46 by the end of the 1985 season. By 1988, he was starting his seventh consecutive season with the club and was rewarded with the captaincy and in 1989 he recorded a 8.24 career best average for the season.\nAfter eleven years with the Scottish club he rode one final season in 1993, riding for Sheffield Tigers and Middlesbrough Bears on loan respectively.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Crips and the Bloods, two street gangs founded in Los Angeles, California, have been in a gang war since the 1970s. The war is made up of smaller, local conflicts perpetrated by chapters of both gangs, and has mostly taken place in major cities in the United States, especially Los Angeles (L.A.). It is also present in other countries, including Belize. The gangs often identify themselves using clothing colored blue for Crips, and red for Bloods; people wearing those colors in gang territory are often targets of violence.\nThe war started when a lack of economic opportunities in South Central L.A. led to the formation of gangs, who claimed city territory and guarded it from other gangs. The Crips and Bloods were major groups who started extorting money from local business distributing in the 70s, and distributing crack cocaine in the early 1980s. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) fought heavily against the gangs. In 1977, they formed a new unit, Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH), which targeted Watts housing projects. In 1987, the LAPD started an intense anti-gang operation, Operation Hammer. The operation was controversial, as it lead to mass incarceration which did not greatly reduce gang violence, and included the vandalism of people's homes; in response, the various gangs gained a sense of solidarity and began discussing a truce. \nA peace agreement was signed in 1992 in Los Angeles between two rivaling Crip chapters, which eventually included the Bloods. The resulting truce lasted in the city for around 10 years; gang violence came back as there was still a lack of economic opportunities. Crime was brought down again due to new policies enacted by the city of Los Angeles starting in 2006. Despite this, the war continued in the city and elsewhere, including a major war in Hempstead, New York, in 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn the 1970s, few job opportunities for young Black men in South Central L.A., especially the neighborhood of Watts, lead to the formation of groups which claimed city territory and guarded it from other gangs. The Crips were formed by Raymond Washington and Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams. Williams \"ruled by terror\", bringing \"impressionable youths\" into his gang and causing shootings across the city. Multiple groups formed in response to the Crips, including the Bloods. The Crips and Bloods went to war with each other to defend their territory. They fought each other with cheap \"Saturday Night Special\" handguns, switchblades, Molotov cocktails, as well as through hand-to-hand combat. They also participated in theft, facilitated by the establishment of protection rackets to extort money from local businesses. In 1979, Washington died in a gang-related shooting, and Williams committed four murders which would later put him on death row.\nIn the 1970s, law enforcement agencies heavily patrolled the South Central area, after civilians had been participating in \"collective violence\" against local government in the 1960s and 70s. In 1972, Los Angeles County created a \"Street Gang Detail\" LAPD unit to combat violent groups. Gang enforcement in turn led to greater membership and numbers of gangs in Watts, Compton, and Inglewood. In 1977, the police unit CRASH started, which targeted gangs mainly in the Watts housing projects of Imperial Courts, Nickerson Gardens, and Jordan Downs.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nIn the early 1980s, drug trafficker Freeway Rick Ross introduced crack cocaine to South Los Angeles Bloods and Crips gangs, and both gangs became distributors. Watts housing projects became \"open-air drug markets\". Gang members started identifying their membership to others through the use of clothing colored blue for Crips, or red for Bloods. This made those who wore affiliated colors targets of violence. By the mid-1980s, the gangs had more advanced weapons, including submachine guns like MAC-10s and Uzis. The amount of weaponry available increased the amount of deaths in drive-by shootings, which resulted in the deaths of many civilians and lead to a greater police response. The Reagan administration supported the removal of many Americans from welfare rolls, food stamps, and school lunch programs, which worsened the conflict. California greatly increased its spending on policing and incarceration in the late 80s. Despite a fourth of Los Angeles gang members being arrested by 1992, gang controls measures were considered to have failed. \nIn the 1980s, many African-descending gangsters from Belize living in California (who were immigrants to the U.S. after a 1961 earthquake in Belize) were deported back to their original country. This Crips–Bloods war was brought back to Belize City. The war in the city grew after the release of the 1988 film Colors, whose plot involves the two gangs in Los Angeles. By 2012, there were 20 to 25 different gangs in the city with some affiliation to either the Crips or Bloods. The war has continued due to conflicts in drug distribution; cocaine left in the ocean by drug cartels have washed up on the shores of Belize for years.\nIn the summer of 1987, as a response to the crack epidemic, LAPD officers started Operation Hammer in Los Angeles, which had a goal of \"[making] life miserable\" for gang members by arresting them for misdemeanors like traffic citations. Large numbers of arrests were made daily. They also performed raids which vandalized local homes; this and similar \"gang-like\" behavior lead to mass violence and arson. The reaction to the violence was a sense of \"solidarity\" that led to discussions (starting in summer 1988) of a ceasefire in the gang war amongst members of the Bounty Hunter Bloods, Grape Street Crips, Pirus (Bloods), and the PJ Watts Crips.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n\n==== 1992 Los Angeles truce and riots ====\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Amer-I-Can program (led by former NFL player Jim Brown) had been holding discreet meetings on \"the principles of responsibility and self-determination\". Many of the men in these meetings went on to organize a truce that happened between the Grape Street Crips and their rivals, the PJ Watts Crips, at the Imperial Courts housing project (home of the PJ Watts Crips) on April 28, 1992. The 1992 Los Angeles riots on April 29 were over the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King. They involved mass looting and arson, and were ended by a massive law enforcement presence on May 4. \nThe Crips and Bloods decided the riots were \"an opportunity to transform themselves and their community\". During the riots, graffiti was made across the city advertising the April 28 truce. On May 3, the Pirus Bloods joined the April 28 accords. On May 16 and 17, as the National Guard was being withdrawn from Los Angeles, the Crips and Bloods sponsored a Saturday \"unity picnic\" and a Sunday family event which welcomed members of the community. More than 5,000 people (including Congresswoman Maxine Waters) showed up to these events, including members of both gangs. A final treaty between gangs featured a code of ethics included the phrase: \"I accept the duty to honor, uphold and defend the spirit of the red, blue and purple [the colors of the Watts gangs], to teach the black [sic] family its legacy and protracted struggle for freedom and justice.” It also prohibited the throwing up of gang signs. \nCommunity organizers created the Community Against Police Abuse and Community Youth Gang Services with the goal of stopping future violence. They also pushed for more employment opportunities, to offset the amount of people who got involved in gang conflict because they could make money from the gangs' drug trade. The reforms made by the community after the riot temporarily decreased violence and lead to the association of members of both gangs. In 1993, gang-related deaths in Los Angeles decreased by 10 percent, the first decrease since 1984. \n\n\n==== Failure of gang reforms ====\nAfter the truce, Sneakers made by the company Eurostar were manufactured which featured gang colors or the colors of the Pan-African flag, to promote the truce; \"TRUCE\" was written on the heels. President George H.W. Bush praised Eurostar, which promised to use the profits to pay employees who would be former gang members. The promise was unsuccessful, as Eurostar faltered by the summer of 1993. \nThe LAPD claimed that the truce included a pledge among gang members to commit violence against police. This led to a greater police patrol, which went against community organizers' wishes. They also arrested many people who were celebrating the truce in hopes that they would be angered and commit violence. \nIn mid-May 1992, members of the Crips and Bloods drafted a proposal for the city's new Rebuild LA city program, requesting a $3.728 billion investment in gang-affected communities. Rebuild LA chose not to work with the gangs, and so the proposal failed; however, it nonetheless influenced lawmakers' policies. Rebuild LA invested far less into affected communities than it had pledged, and by 1997, it disbanded. One of the organizers of the truce said that despite a decrease in gang violence, \"this community [Watts] is more hopeless now that it was before\", and that \"they have no hope that anything is gonna change\". The truce made in 1992 would last for about a decade. Time magazine wrote: \"Given the continued lack of jobs, substandard housing, limited educational opportunities, and police harassment—all of the conditions that precipitated the rebellion in the first place—the old status quo seemed destined to reemerge. Crime, collective mistrust, and exhaustive policing ultimately prevailed.\"\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nOn December 25, 2005, Branden Lullard (\"Baby Loc\"), the head of the Grape Street Crips, was shot in the face. This led to a violent feud between the Bounty Hunter Bloods and Grape Street Crips which lasted for months. The first Blood to die was within an hour of Lullard's shooting. The feud would lead to 20 shootings which included 8 deaths. It lead to the area's city councilwoman, Janice Hahn, creating the Watts Gang Task Force, a neighborhood watch group headed by relatives of gang members. \nThe Watts Gang Task Force included Cynthia Mendenhall, who was a high-ranking member of the PJ Crips in the 1980s. She had planned to build a charter school in Watts, which was criticized by Maxine Waters. The two had a public feud, which led to Mendenhall getting support from local Republican politicians. However, she decided to leave the task force. On April 26, 2006, Mendenhall's son Anthony Owens was shot and killed outside Imperial Courts, in a drive-by shooting perpetrated by the Carver Park Compton Crips. The hospital Owens was being treated at was visited by the PJ Crips, Grape Street Crips, and Bounty Hunter Bloods. Mendenhall told the crowd that Owens had died and pleaded with them not to seek revenge. Police honored her as a peacemaker, and provided to her a motorcade escort to the funeral, which was visited by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. \nThree months later, Mendenhall's other son Darrian was spotted by police driving in a Dodge Charger, a car frequently used by gangsters. Darrian, who had an illegal handgun in his car, sped over to a nearby housing development where Mendenhall was working as a property manager. The two had a struggle, and he shot himself in the head in front of her. A crowd outside heard the shot and assumed police had killed him. They started pelting the police at the scene with rocks and bottles, and a riot nearly started. The violence stopped after Mendenhall, at the request of LAPD Captain Rick Jacobs, told the crowd Darrian had shot himself. This meant Mendenhall had twice stopped gang-related conflict.\nIn 2006, Charlie Beck, a former CRASH officer, became Deputy Chief for the South Bureau of the Los Angeles Police Department. He worked with civil rights lawyer Connie Rice to develop \"a plan to train, certify and deploy gang-intervention workers to the city's hot spots\". Villaraigosa also changed the city's method of dealing with gangs by spending $21 million of his office's annual budget on the city's Gang Reduction and Youth Development program. The New York Times described the program as such: \"Schools in neighborhoods with the highest gang presence, including Watts, now systematically identify the most at-risk children for extra services; gang-intervention workers receive city financing; and the city provides summer activities through its Summer Night Lights programs, which keeps parks and recreation centers open later in high-crime neighborhoods.\" Beck became the chief of the LAPD in 2009. His tenure was successful; from 2011 to 2013, violent crime fell down 30 percent in Watts.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2011, a war started in San Diego, California, when a member of a Bloods-connected gang was killed by the Crips. Prosecutors claimed that a member of the Bloods gang, Nicholas Hoskins, made an agreement with at least 20 fellow members to kill Bloods. He was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but the conviction was thrown out by the California Supreme Court in 2022, saying there was no evidence of conspiracy.\nIn 2012, there was a major war in and around the village of Hempstead, New York (mostly in the village's Linden Triangle neighborhood), which lead to 56 people being shot by the end of the year (40 of them within Hempstead). 10 of them died, and three became fully or partially paralyzed. The war ended when the Crips lured two of the Bloods' leaders into an ambush under the guise of negotiating a truce. Those Bloods then associated with a gang called the Very Crispy Gangsters.\nBy 2014, an estimated 20,000 people had died from the war.\nIn 2015, Baltimore, Maryland's police department announced that there was a \"credible threat\" of violence from the city's Crips, Bloods, and Black Guerrila Family, saying that the three gangs had formed a partnership. There was a popular theory among \"observers\" of the police department (including Slate magazine) that this announcement was fake, and used to distract the public from the department's poor image.\n\nOn March 31, 2019, popular rapper Nipsey Hussle, a member of the Rolling 60s Crip gang, was murdered in Crenshaw by Eric Holder, Jr., another member of the Rolling 60s. Nipsey Hussle was well-liked among both Crips and Bloods for his peaceful relations with the Bloods, which included bringing them on stage to perform with him. His death led to the most peace negotiations between the gangs since the 1992 truce. This started with a public meeting between the Swamp Crips and Campanella Park Pirus at Van Ness Park, and continued for multiple meetings at a location east of the 110 Freeway.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nIn 2020, an up-and-coming Blood rapper from Fort Worth, Texas, named Javien Calvin Wright (\"J-Dub\"), was fatally shot outside of his residence. \"Arguing and posturing\" regarding his death began on social media; notably, a YouTube vlogger uploaded a video titled \"Why Channel-5 J-Dub is dead.\", which featured clips of people celebrating while holding guns and wads of money. This conflict over Wright, which began to involve members of gangs on the east and south sides of Fort Worth, lead to a gathering of over 400 people at the city's Village Creek Park on May 10. At the park, there was a shooting which wounded five people.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 1988 film Colors, which follows police officers as they investigate the two gangs in Los Angeles, gained notoriety for using real gangsters as extras, as well as when a Crip murdered a Blood waiting in line to see the movie in Stockton, California.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Weatherby-Kayser Shoe Company was a chain of footwear retailers with origins in Los Angeles in the early 1900s. It was founded in 1884 by Bruce Weatherby and Emil Kayser (d. August 26, 1948).\nOn December 1, 1902, the store moved to 215 S. Broadway in the B. F. Coulter Building (Potomac Block), then in 1911 to the Grant Building at 4th and Broadway, following the gradual migration of upscale stores ever further south and west from the Los Angeles Plaza before suburbanization. In 1924, the store had opened branches in Pasadena and Hollywood. By 1925, the main store was at 416-8 W. Seventh Street, between Olive and Hill, about 17,000 sq ft (1,600 m2) in size, in addition to the 4th & Broadway store and a store at the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard. In 1925 it opened a 12,000 sq ft (1,100 m2) store at 715–7–9 S. Flower St., in the new upscale shopping area around J. W. Robinson's and Barker Brothers' new stores, which a newspaper at the time called the \"Fifth Avenue of the West\".\n\n\n== Expansion ==\n\n\n=== Other Western cities ===\nBy the 1920s there was a store in San Diego on 6th Street. A store opened in Valley Plaza in 1955.\n\n\n=== Arizona ===\nIn 1929 Weatherby-Kayser opened a store in Phoenix, Arizona, in the Security Building at 242 N. Central Avenue. It later opened a branch in 1961 in El Con Center in Tucson, and by 1964 Chris-Town in Phoenix.  \n\n\n=== St. Louis area ===\nBy 1963 the chain had opened four stores in the St. Louis area, including one in Richmond Heights, Missouri, across from what was then the Westroads Shopping Center (now the Saint Louis Galleria).\n\n\n=== Los Angeles suburbs ===\nIn 1985 the firm advertised 13 locations in Greater Los Angeles: \n\nWestside: Westwood, Century City, and Culver City–Fox Hills Mall\nSan Fernando Valley: Topanga Plaza, and Sherman Oaks Fashion Square\nSouth Bay: Palos Verdes–Peninsula Center and Torrance-Del Amo Fashion Center\nSan Gabriel Valley: Puente Hills, Arcadia–Santa Anita Fashion Park, and West Covina Fashion Plaza\nSoutheast Los Angeles County: Cerritos\nOrange County: Santa Ana Fashion Square and Westminster\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of Downtown Los Angeles store 1904\nPhoto of interior of San Diego store\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jim Gannon (born 4 March 1948) is an English guitarist.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom Leicester, he was a member of prog rock band Black Widow from 1969 to 1972. He is credited on their first four studio albums, including Sacrifice and their self titled album. Sacrifice features the band's best known song \"Come to the Sabbat\" and its lyrical themes are centred on Satanism and occultism. Gannon left Black Widow in 1972, and the band dissolved in 1973. From 1974 to 1981, Gannon was the guitarist for Fox. Led by American songwriter Kenny Young and fronted by Australian singer Noosha Fox, they had three top 20 hits on the UK Singles Chart - \"Only You Can\" and \"Imagine Me, Imagine You\" in 1975 and \"S-S-S-Single Bed\" in 1976, the latter song topping the Austrian charts, entering number five in the UK, and later being covered by duo Bananarama.\nIn the mid-1970s (c. 1977), Gannon, with Fox members Kenny Young and Herbie Armstrong formed the group Yellow Dog. The band is considered a One-hit wonder, as their only commercial song was \"Just One More Night\". It ends on a humorous note with a telephone call in which the protagonist (a woman) continues to beg to be allowed to stay \"just one more night\" after being told emphatically \"No!\", and for this reason is considered something of a novelty song. Overall, Yellow Dog released three studio albums, only one of which charted (at number 50 in Australia), and included many famous musical figures, such as Gerry Conway of Fairport Convention, session guitarist Phil Palmer, and multi-instrumentalist and public speaker Mo Foster. Yellow Dog faded out of obscurity, and quietly disbanded around 1981.\n\n\n== References ==",

She has been a professor of computational medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) since 2020. Langenberg investigates the basics of metabolic diseases using large amounts of data from international patient and population studies.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nClaudia Langenberg studied medicine in Münster. After her clinical training and work in Germany, she moved to England for her Master's and PhD in epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University College London and completed her specialist training in Public Health in 2016.\nLangenberg was also involved in setting up international consortia such as MAGIC (Meta-Analysis of Glucose and Insulin related traits Consortium) and COMETS (Consortium of Metabolomics Studies). She was chief editor of the 2016 report Generation Genome by the UK Chief Medical Officer.\nIn 2017, Langenberg took over as Program Director of Molecular Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, where she was previously involved in discovering the genetic basis of metabolic diseases and risk factors.\n\n\n== Research focus ==\nThe focus of Langenberg's research is on the discovery of genetic influences on so-called 'omic' data, specifically on metabolites circulating in human blood. Her research group integrates data on these metabolites from large-scale population and clinical studies. This is used to characterize the genetic makeup of the human metabolism and its influence on health and disease, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHelmholtz International Fellow Award, 9 July 2018\nIn recognition of Langenberg's achievements as a scientist and researcher, an exhibition plaque was dedicated to her as part of the exhibition \"Berlin – Capital of Women Scientists\" on the occasion of Wissensstadt Berlin 2021.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublications of Claudia Langenberg at Google Scholar\nClaudia Langenberg at the Berlin Institute of Health website\nClaudia Langenberg at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Invisible Light: Spells is a collaborative album by American musician T Bone Burnett, drummer Jay Bellerose and keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, released on August 5, 2022, through Verve Forecast Records. It is the second installment in The Invisible Light series, following The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space (2019). The album received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Invisible Light: Spells received a score of 70 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on reviews from five critics, which the website categorized as \"generally favorable\" reception. Uncut felt that \"The likes of 'Casting a Spell' and 'You May Leave But This Will Bring You Back' reassure that Burnett's formidable facility for waspish wordplay remains intact.\" Mark Deming of AllMusic found it to be similar to Acoustic Space in that it is \"built around the percussion of Burnett's longtime associate Jay Bellerose and the clouds of sound conjured by keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, generating slowly roiling sonic backdrops of rhythm and carefully sculpted noise, with Burnett chanting his verse over it all\". Lee Zimmerman of American Songwriter said that it \"veers sharply\" from Acoustic Space as it \"consists almost entirely of songs marked by didactic rhythms and ominous overtones\" and a \"heady fusion of trance, electronica, tribal and global music\".\nPopMatters' Steve Horowitz wrote that \"Burnett and company go high tech to attack high tech\" as \"the lyrics offer whip-smart criticisms of technology and its users\" and \"the instrumentation and arrangements can be primal, martial, or formal then mixed with more contemporary electronic effects\". Shawn Donohue of Glide Magazine commented that Burnett \"continu[es] his avant-garde style, furthering his sense of desolation, end of times despair, and unflinching pessimism\" with an album that \"feels as if it was sonically inspired by the Talking Heads' Remain in Light track 'The Overload' with humming uncertainty, bleak windswept soundscapes, and a sense of percolating anxiety\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The rebellion began with mutinies by Tuareg officers integrated into the Malian army following the Tuareg rebellion of the 1990s, and mediation between the Malian government and the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) began immediately afterwards. The mediation culminated in the Algiers Accords of 2006, although the same Tuareg leaders during the 2006 rebellion went on to ally with Nigerien Tuareg rebels during the Tuareg rebellion of 2007 to 2009.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Tuareg rebellion of the 1990s ended with the signing of a National Pact in 1996, with one of the provisions being the reintegration of Tuareg rebels into the Malian Army. In 2006, Kel Adagh Tuaregs of Kidal Region took issue with the promotion of El Hadj Ag Gamou, an Imghad Tuareg; considered by Kel Adagh to be a servile class. This promotion prompted members of the Ifergenoussen sub-clan of Kel Adagh to form the May 23, 2006 Democratic Alliance for Change, focused on gaining more autonomy for Kidal Region.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\nThe rebellion began on May 23, 2006, at the Malian army bases in Kidal and Menaka, with ADC-affiliated Tuareg officers mutinying and looting arms at their bases. The rebels then retreated to remote bases in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in northern Kidal Region. The ADC was led by Hassan Ag Fagaga, who had been passed over for promotion in favor of Gamou, and Ibrahim Ag Bahanga, Iyad Ag Ghaly, and Ahmada Ag Bibi joined the group shortly afterward. Ghaly took the reins of the rebellion early on and attracted many Ifergenoussen rebels, although the group was not entirely Ifergenoussen.\nMalian authorities quickly entered negotiations with the ADC immediately after the rebellion's start, and offered concessions very similar to those outlined in the National Pact and the Tamanrasset Accords. Kafougouna Koné, the Malian minister of Territorial Affairs, led the Malian delegation during the negotiations. Meanwhile, Malian forces sent reinforcements to Kidal and Menaka and formed two militias to secure territory; one was led by El Hadj Ag Gamou, and one was led by Tilemsi Arab Ould Meydou.\nIn June, negotiations shifted to Algerian mediation, as the ADC rejected mediation from Tuareg leaders from Kidal Region and Tuaregs from LIbya. During the renewed negotiations, Algeria forced the ADC to drop their demands for autonomy, while forcing Malian officials to drop their demands of a ban on contacting Tuareg organizations in other countries. These negotiations culminated in the Algiers Accords of 2006 on July 4, 2006. Malian elites disliked the accords, and attempted to stall it's implementation.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe rebellion ended with the Algiers Accords, although Fagaga, Bahanga, Ghaly, and Bibi all helped lead the ADC in a renewed rebellion that began in 2007. From July to October 2006, the ADC and the jihadist Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat clashed multiple times across Mali, with Ghaly uniting various Tuareg groups against the GSPC.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTuareg rebellion (1962–1964)\nTuareg rebellion (1990–1995)\nTuareg rebellion (2007–2009)\nMali War\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jean-Baptiste - Joseph Willart de Grécourt was a French ecclesiastic and poet born on February 7, 1684, in Vallières (currently Fondettes) and died at Tours on April 2, 1743.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGrécourt comes from a family of Scottish origin, noble but without fortune, son of Jean Baptiste Vuillart, lord of Grécourt, advisor to the king, grenetier of the salt granary of Tours and the Anne Orceau. His mother had to take a job as a post office manager in Tours to provide for her family. Grécourt himself, as a cadet, was destined for the Church. He studied in Paris under the direction of an ecclesiastical uncle whose credit obtained for him the title of canon of Saint-Martin de Tours in 1697, when he was only fourteen years old.\nOnce ordained a priest, Grécourt had great success through his talents as a preacher, but his preaching had to be put an end to after the scandal caused by a sermon in which he had made many serious allusions to several ladies of the city. His temperament led him more towards poetry and pleasures. Brilliant positions were offered to him, which he always refused, declining for example the offers of John Law, who wanted to attach him and to whom he responded with an apologue in verse, Le Solitaire et la fortune.\nWhile remaining a canon, he renounced ecclesiastical life and spent a lot of time in Paris, where he became friends with Marshal d'Estrées and other young libertines. He ends up settling completely in the capital where he is a regular among the freest and most gallant companies. Epicurean, lover of pretty women and good food, he composed many licentious tales and poems, often libertine, among which there is a long poem against the Jesuits titled Philotanus, burlesque pieces, epistles, fables, tales, epigrams, madrigals. He refrained from having them printed but circulated them secretly, giving extracts in selected circles, because he read, it seems, in an incomparable manner. He is one of the main authors of Recueil de poésies choisies rassemblées par un cosmopolite, printed in 1735 in only 62 copies for the Duke of Aiguillon.\nHe died in 1743, leaving a pleasant epitaph for himself:\n\nIl est mort, le pauvre chrétien!\nMolina perd un adversaire\nEt l'amour un historien.\nSi je consulte son bréviaire\nLa religion n'y perd rien.\n\n\n== Works ==\nPhilotanus, ou l'Histoire de la constitution Unigenitus, poem, 1720\nLes Appellants de l'autre monde, 1731–1732\nLes Nouveaux appellants; ou la Bibliothèque des damnés.

        "content": "Borisas Dauguvietis (26 March 1885 – 13 July 1949) was a Lithuanian actor, playwright, writer, poet, and theater director. He is the brother of pianist Lidija Dauguvietytė, and father of actresses Galina Dauguvietytė, Elena Dauguvietytė-Kudabienė, and Ksana Dauguvietytė-Šniukštienė. The Borisas Dauguvietis Earring Award is named after him, and is given to people who significantly contribute to Lithuanian theater.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nBorisas Dauguvietis was born on 26 March 1885 in the Dauguviečiai village of the Russian Empire. According to Dauguvietis, his ancestors were Don Cossacks. He attended school in Panevėžys, in which he participated in an anti-Tsarist strike in 1905, and Jelgava. After briefly studying engineering in Riga, Dauguvietis enrolled in the Imperial Theatrical School in St. Petersburg, which he graduated from in 1909. From 1909 to 1913 he acted at the St. Petersburg Literary and Artistic Society Theatre. From 1914 to 1920 he continued his acting career in Nizhny Novgorod and Penza, and also headed an enterprise in Grodno.\n\n\n=== Director in Lithuania ===\nIn 1920 he returned to Lithuania in Rigmantiškiai to work as a forester. Here he encountered the Biržai Music and Drama Society Mūza, and shortly became its director. Dauguvietis gained notoriety after directing Molière's play Le Médecin malgré lui. In 1922 Dauguvietis began talks with Liudas Gira, then the director of the National Kaunas Drama Theatre. In 1923 he was invited to direct for the theater. He also lectured at the Kaunas Theater School, which he founded in 1924 along with Konstantinas Glinskis. From 1924 to 1940 Dauguvietis produced and directed various plays in the theater, especially those of Petras Vaičiūnas. He also worked with authors such as Kazys Binkis, Augustinas Gricius, and Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas. In 1929 he wrote a travel book Teatrališkoji Maskva (Theatrical Moscow). From 1931 to 1935 Dauguvietis also directed plays at the Šiauliai Drama Theater. In 1931 Dauguvietis was awarded the Order of Gediminas, 3rd degree. The following year he was awarded the Order of the Three Stars, 3rd degree. In 1938 he was awarded the Order of Vytautas the Great, 3rd degree.\nDauguvietis also produced Russian and other foreign classic plays. Under Dauguvietis's initiative, the weekly newspaper 7 meno dienos was established. Dauguvietis's performances were characterized by expressive theatricality, emotion, and comedic interludes. Dauguvietis's students included the actors Elena Bindokaitė, Emilija Grikevičiūtė, Galina Jackevičiūtė, Kazys Jarašūnas, Aleksandras Kernagis, Bronė Kurmytė, Vanda Lietuvaitytė, Balys Lukošius, Antanas Mackevičius, Juozas Monkevičius, Stasys Petraitis, Emilija Platušaitė, Alfonsas Radzevičius, Juozas Rudzinskas, and Liucija Rutkauskaitė.   Dauguvietis reportedly liked classical music, could play the cello and the piano, and knew many of Alexander Pushkin's, Mikhail Lermontov's, and Sergei Yesenin's poems. Dauguvietis also composed poems himself. He enjoyed frequently retreating to his home village of Dauguviečiai rather than the classical resort of Palanga.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nDuring Nazi Germany's war with the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1944, Dauguvietis lived in the Joniškis District. After the war, Dauguvietis himself wrote several plays: Nauja vaga (1945), Uždavinys (1946), and Žaldokynė (1947). From 1947 Dauguvietis was the manager of art and director at the Lithuanian National Drama Theater. Additionally, he was a deputy of the Supreme Council of the USSR and chairman of the Playwrights Section of the Theater Society and the Writers' Union.\nBorisas Dauguvietis died on 13 July 1949 in Vilnius. He was buried in the Rasos Cemetery.\n\n\n== Remembrance ==\nSculptor Rapolas Jakimavičius created a bust of Dauguvietis which stands in the foyer of the Lithuanian National Drama Theater. The surname of Dauguvietis is engraved in the \"Tree of Unity\" sculpture in Vilnius, which contains one hundred of the most prominent Lithuanian personalities of all time. There is also a street named after him in Vilnius.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Herbert Shelley Bevington (15 December 1852 – 9 August 1926) was a footballer who played for Clapham Rovers in the 1879 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBevington was born in Denmark Hill, the younger of two children to Henry and Mary Ann Bevington; his mother's maiden name provided his middle name.  He was educated at Harrow School, an early promoter of the association game, and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge as a pensioner in Michaelmas term in 1871; he took his Bachelor of Arts in 1875 and his Master of Arts in 1878.\nHe showed significant athletic prowess at university, representing his college in the quarter-mile in a university meeting in February 1872 and on the cricket pitch that summer.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nHe first played for the Cambridge University A.F.C. in 1871, with his second match being against the Wanderers at the Kennington Oval.  He received a Blue for his appearances for Cambridge, although he was unable to play in the first Varsity match against Oxford University in 1874; in the 1875 match, he officiated as referee.\nBy the time the university entered the FA Cup for the first time, in 1873–74, he had been made captain; he gave so much for the cause in the university's first FA Cup match - against South Norwood, also at the Oval - that he was knocked flat in one run on goal, and forced to leave the pitch, but \"with great pluck\" returned.  In the second round, the Light Blues were drawn to face Clapham Rovers, and took the more experienced side to a draw, before losing 4–1 in the replay; Bevington made the Cambridge goal by backing up fellow Trinitarian Roberts.\nThe meeting with the Rovers proved beneficial for both the Hybrid Club and Bevington, as for the 1874–75 he was found in the Clapham cerise and grey, as well as making the occasional appearance for the Harrow Chequers.  He scored his first competitive goal in the first round of the 1875–76 FA Cup – the opener in a 3–0 win over the Panthers, played at Winchester - and apart from the 1876–77 season, in which he seems not to have played at all, remained a fixture in the side until 1878.  He also made guest appearanes for the Wanderers in 1875–76, and for South Norwood and the Old Harrovians in 1877–78.\nHe did not play in the 1878–79 FA Cup at all, other than the final, in which he missed \"an easy shot\" just before half-time, which proved costly as opponents Old Etonians scored the only goal just after the hour.  He did, however, play in many other high-profile matches, usually as a left-sided forward, including in a friendly against Rangers at the Oval in October 1878.\nThe Cup final seems to have been his final match, although he continued to officiate matches as a Clapham Rovers member, and also officiated at the Rovers' athletic sports.\n\n\n=== Representative football ===\nHe came close to representing England against Scotland twice.  In 1876 he was a reserve for a match which England lost 3–0, and in 1878 he took part in an international trial match, albeit playing for the Improbables XIV against the Probables XII at the Kennington Oval.  He represented the London Football Association in the \"mini-international\" against the Sheffield Football Association in 1876 at Bramall Lane, but the visitors were turned over 6–0, despite Bevington's \"effective service\".\n\n\n== Post-football and personal life ==\nBevington married Seraphine Jonghmans (the daughter of a professor of music) at Holy Trinity Church in Brompton on 28 March 1883.  They had a daughter (Vera) and a son (Reginald).\nIn common with many of the Clapham Rovers, Bevington was from the middle class.  He became a partner (with his uncle Samuel) in the family firm of Bevington and Morris, a fur and leather trading company, based at Cannon Street, and his household ran an average of four servants from 1891 to 1911.  By 1924 the partnership consisted of Herbert and his son Reginald.\nHe lived his later life in Clapham Common, but happened to be in a house in Streatham when he died, on 9 August 1926.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sogolon Wulen Condé (Gambian English: Sogolon Konte/Konteh) of Dò ni Kiri, commonly known as Sogolon Condé (in Malian French), was a 13th-century princess of Imperial Mali, and one of the prominent women portrayed in the Epic of Sundiata. Her trials and tribulations are well preserved in the epic. She was the second wife of Faama (King) Naré Maghann Konaté, and mother of Mansa Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire in the 13th century. \nAccording to Bamba Suso and Banna Kanute, Sogolong's father was Sankarang Madiba Konte, also known as Faa Ganda (probably Sangaran Madiba Konte, king of Sankaran, according to Conrad and Frank), a descendant of Khulubu Konte. In the epic, Sogolon is portrayed as the daughter of the \"buffalo woman\" (Dò Kamissa, from the land of Dô/Dò)–so-called because of her \"ugliness\" and hunchback, and so was Sogolong. The griots of Guinea refer to Sogolon as the younger sister of Do Kamissa. In many parts of the Senegambia region, and Mali, Sogolon is regarded as her daughter. As well as her physical deformities and \"ugliness\", Sogolon also gave birth to a disabled son (Sundiata), and was ridiculed for that. Following the death of her husband Naré Maghann Konaté, her co-wife, the politically ambitious Sassouma Bereté, Naré Maghann's first wife along with their first son Dankaran Toumani Keïta, plotted against Sogolon and her children, including assassination attempts on their lives. Fearing that the new King Dankaran and his mother Sassouma could inflict harm upon her and her children, Sogolon went into exile with her children to protect them from harm. Due to the power and influence of Dankaran and his mother, Sogolon and her children were refused asylum by many states within the Ghana Empire they traversed seeking protection. She was eventually granted asylum by the King of Mema (or Nema) Mansa Farin Tunkara. In Mema, Sogolon encouraged his disabled son Sundiata to fulfill his destiny, and return to Mali (Manden) and take the throne.\nThe King of Mema who admired Sundiata for his courage and tenacity despite his physical disability as a cripple (paralised from the waiste down) gave him important responsibilities in Mema. Following the conquest of the Mandinka people by the powerful and vailiant warrior Sosso King, Soumaoro Kanté, messengers were sent to search for Sogolon and her children, as Sundiata was destined to be a great leader according to the prophecy revealed to his late father prior to his marriage to Sogolon. The prohecy revealed to the late King Naré Maghann, was for him to marry a woman of Sogolon's physical's attributes as she would bear him a great heir despite her lack of physical beauty and hunchback. The messengers found Sogolon's children in Mema, and persuaded Sundiata to return home and liberate his people and their homeland. Sogolon had died prior to the messengers' arrival in Mema. Accompanied by a force of soldiers given to him by the King of Mema, Sundiata returned home with his siblings, and at the plains of Sibi, gathered some of the Mande warrior clans including the future conqueror of Kaabu, Mansa Tiramakhan Traore—where an alliance was formed to liberate their people and land from the powerful Soumaoro Kanté. That alliance resulted in the famous Battle of Kirina (1235), the battle which gave birth of the Mali Empire.\n\n\n== Other names ==\nThere are many spelling variations of Sogolon's name depending on the West African country, and whether the country is a French or English speaking country. The last name Condé (Anglacised to Konde) is a variation of the French spelling \"Conté\" (Konte/Konteh/Conteh in English). Some of these variations are given below:\n\nSukulung Conté (in Malian French)\nSogolon Kédjou\nSukulung Konte/Konteh/Conteh (in Gambian English)\nSukulung Konte/Katuma\nSogolon Konde\n\n\n== Death ==\nSogolon died in Mema before her son Sundiata was crowned Mansaya. After her death, Sundiata returned to Mandea (or Manden) with his siblings including the Princess Kolonkan, herself a powerful woman in her own right, where Sundiata would go on to liberate his people and accept the kingship.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSogolon Condé is remembered as a loving and supportive mother, who despite her lack of physical \"beauty\" and hunchback, and having \"faced severe hardship\", and giving birth to a disabiled son for which she was much ridiculed for, she overcame that and helped her son overcame his disability. Upon the death of her husband, and sensing imminent danger to both herself and her children, she protected them by seeking asylum in a foreign land where she could ensure her family is safe and protected. In  the Senegambia region, and in Mali, when the griots praises Sundiata Keita, he is sometimes praised through his mother Sogolon, for example one of the many names ascribed to Sundiata Keita is \"Sogolon Djata/Jata\", which in Mande mean son of Sogolon. His name \"Sundiata\" is believed to be a contraction of his mother's name \"Sogolon Jata\". His other name Mari Djata/Jata mean the Lion King. Sogolon had great ambitions for her son, and is regarded as the source of Sundiata's greatness.  According to David Conrad et al., she is \"one of the great heroines of Manding oral tradition, and her death is invariably noted as a significant event\" in the narrative.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nKouroukan Fouga\nBalla Fasséké\nGbara\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nConrad, David C., \"Sunjata: a West African epic of the Mande peoples.\" (editors: David C.

        "content": "Sebastião Maria Reis Bugalho (born 15 November 1995) is a Portuguese journalist and political commentator. He will lead the Democratic Alliance's list for the 2024 European elections.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe is the eldest son of journalists João Alberto Santos Fernandes Bugalho and Patrícia Reis.\nHe was a student of Political Science at the Institute of Political Studies of the Catholic University and he currently studies at ISCTE – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa.\n\n\n== Journalistic activity ==\nHe began his journalistic career at the Jornal i, when only 19 years old, after he proposed to write an opinion article there. He was subsequently invited to write an weekly opinion column and to work on the news coverage of the CDS – People's Party.\nIn his first years of college he combined classes with internships at Jornal i and Sol. He wrote mainly about politics, having interviewed Pedro Nuno Santos, Graça Fonseca, Rui Moreira, Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos and André Ventura. Shortly before abandoning his journalistic career, he published a article about the future list of CDS-PP candidates for the 2019 legislative elections, a list that he would later join.\nHe was then invited to offer political commentary on TVI, with José Miguel Júdice and Constança Cunha e Sá. He then had a program, with António Rolo Duarte, Novos Fora Nada, on TVI24.\nHe was a columnist at Diário de Notícias, at Observador and a commentator at CNN Portugal. He is currently a columnist for the weekly Expresso. Since October 2023, he has been a commentator on SIC Notícias, which underwent a rebranding that same month.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nHe was chosen by Assunção Cristas to join, in sixth place, the CDS-PP list, in the 2019 Legislative Elections, by the Lisbon constituency, as an independent. At that time he was not elected but later, in September 2021, he was able to replace the MP Ana Rita Bessa, in the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal, but at that time he refused to do so.\nBugalho considers himself to be right-wing, Catholic and conservative, but also Europeanist and Atlanticist.\n\n\n== References ==",

Inaugurated on 6 March 2024, it covers an area of 5600 square meters. It is the first mosque in the world that was constructed using 3D printing technology, reflecting Hejazi architecture. The mosque was built by Wajnat Abdulwahed, the widow of Saudi Arabian businessman and equestrian Abdulaziz Abdullah Abbas Sharbatly, who died in 2021 and after whom the mosque is named.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAbdulaziz Abdullah Sharbatly Mosque was inaugurated on 6 March 2024. It is the first mosque in the world that was constructed using 3D printing technology. The 4 printers used in 3D printing technology were manufactured by China-based Hangzhou GuanLi Company. The mosque was designed by Mohammed bin Adam al-Suqair and was built as part of several projects overseen by the National Housing Company, the investment arm of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing. It was a brainchild of Wajnat Abdulwahed, the widow of Saudi Arabian businessman and equestrian Abdulaziz Abdullah Abbas Sharbatly, after whom the mosque is named. Wajnat is the CEO of Fursan Real Estate, the company that took part in the construction, which took six months in total. The design of the open outdoor area of the mosque was inspired by Hijr Ismail, also known as Hateem, beside the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque in Mecca and incorporates elements of traditional Hejazi architecture while adhering to the values of the King Salman Urban Charter.\nThe mosque got completed almost one year before the planned construction of the world's first 3D printed mosque in Dubai, which was slated to be built by 2025.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dave Trownson (born 28 February 1954) is a former motorcycle speedway rider from England.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTrownson, born in Urmston, Greater Manchester, began his British leagues career riding a couple of times for Boston Barracudas during the 1973 British League Division Two season season after being signed from Belle Vue Aces.\nThe following season he started riding for Boston reserves before securing a season-long loan deal with Berwick Bandits. He enjoyed his time at Berwick and did not want to return to Boston. After riding for Berwick in 1975 and making a few appearances for his new parent club Wolverhampton Wolves, he suffered a miserable 1976 season, struggling to gain selection and then breaking his arm.\nTrownson began the 1977 National League season with Wolves but soon found a home at Edinburgh Monarchs, who had returned to speedway after a seven-year break. \nTrownson not only became a regular with Edinburgh but soon emerged as fan's favourite, improving his season average for six consecutive years from 6.15 in 1977 to 9.21 in 1982. He was also part of the team that won the 1981 Knockout Cup and Fours championship final, held at the East of England Arena on 26 July 1981.\nTrownson became the club's number 1 rider and would spend eleven years in total in Scotland until the end of the 1987 season. \n\n\n== References ==",

At the time of his birth, his parents were in house arrest near Yalta, living at the estate of his mother's brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander. As a young child he moved with his parents to the Caucasus, where his little brother was born in April 1919. In November of the same year, the family escaped to Novorossiysk where they lived with the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte. Following this, the family fled Russia and by spring 1920, they moved to Denmark where they first lived at the Amalienborg Palace, then at Hvidøre.\nTikhon retained his connection to Russia, spoke Russian well and his parents' home became the centre of the Russian monarchist community in Denmark.\n\n\n== Second World War and aftermath ==\nTikhon served as an officer in the Danish Army during the occupation of Denmark. He was kept as a prisoner of war, but initially for less than two months. He was imprisoned for another month after being arrested on charges of espionage.\nIn 1948 he emigrated from Denmark with his parents, wife, brother, sister-in-law and their two children. First arriving in London, they later moved to Canada as agricultural immigrants.\nOn April 6, 1993, he was in hospitalized in Canada, and he died two days later.\n\n\n== Marriages and children ==\nTikhon married three times. His first marriage was to the Danish-born Agnete Carla Petersen in April 1942. They divorced, without issue, in 1955.\nHe then married Libya Sebastian, with whom he had one daughter, Olga Tikhonovna, born in 1964. He and Sebastian divorced prior to his third marriage to Olga Nikolaievna Pupynina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Tractatus de herbis (Treatise on Herbs), sometimes called Secreta Salernitana (Secrets of Salerno), is a textual and figural tradition of herbals handed down through several illuminated manuscripts of the late Middle Ages. These treatises present pure plant, mineral, or animal substances with therapeutic properties. Depending on the version, there are between 500 and over 900 entries, grouped in alphabetical order. Originating in Italy, they were distributed throughout Europe and contributed to the transmission and popularity of the pharmacopeia of the Salerno School of Medicine.\nThe illustrations in these manuscripts attracted the attention of art historians from the 1950s onwards, due to their descriptive value, which was interpreted as a revival of Greek botanical illustration. Some of these plant images represent the first studies based on nature since Antiquity. The original Latin text, whose author remains unknown, comes from Circa instans, a work from the second half of the 12th century attributed to Matthaeus Platearius, and written in the Salernitan milieu. It is augmented by extracts from other late antique and early medieval sources, such as Pseudo-Apuleius, Arabic medicine handed down by Constantine the African, medieval Latin versions of Dioscorides' work, Isaac Israeli's dietary principles, and perhaps includes pharmaco-botanical knowledge from oral tradition.\nThe two earliest versions of the Tractatus de herbis, whose relationship is debated, are preserved in Egerton Manuscript 747 at the British Library in London and in Latin Manuscript 6823 at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. The manuscripts derived from them are mainly divided between a group originating in northern Italy, some copies of which are devoid of text, and a French translation containing almost thirty testimonies and known collectively as the Livre des simples médecines. The latter was responsible for the publication of the first herbarium printed in French, Le Grant Herbier en françoys, which underwent several reissues between the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and was in turn translated into English as the Grete Herball.\nThe origins of the tradition and the exact function of herbariums remain obscure and debated. While the earliest manuscripts were probably compiled as true scientific treatises, some derivative versions are more like prestige creations intended for a wealthy elite. Despite competition in the early 15th century from more naturalistic works, such as the Herbarium Carrarense, the schematic, flattened images of the Tractatus de herbis enjoyed over two centuries of popularity, before being definitively sidelined by the shimmering exoticism of New World plants.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nThe title Tractatus de herbis appears for the first time in a late 18th-century catalog of the Estense Library in Modena, to designate, within a collection of larger medical texts, a specific treatise on medical matters in Latin attributed to Dioscorides. It is derived from the explicit text that begins with the phrase Explicit tractatus herbarum (\"Ends the treatise on herbs\"). The treatise attracted the attention of the self-taught botanist Jules Camus, who recognized it as an amplified and illustrated version of Circa instans, a twelfth-century Latin text attributed to Matthieu Platearius and known since the second half of the eighteenth century through the works of Albrecht von Haller and, above all, Kurt Sprengel. In his study published in 1886, Camus also analyzed a second manuscript from the Estense library, which he identified as the French translation of the Tractatus de herbis and as the primitive version of a work printed at the end of the 15th century under the title Le Grant Herbier en françoys.\nIn 1950, the Austrian art historian Otto Pächt noted that the Modena Tractatus was merely a copy of a manuscript in London's British Library, ms. Egerton 747, and that the latter had been compiled 150 years earlier. He also established that two other versions, preserved in Florence and Rome respectively, were directly derived from the London manuscript and belonged to the same figurative tradition, which he called Secreta Salernitana. In 1974, the Swiss Felix Baumann studied the development of this tradition, alongside his work on the Carrara herbarium, and popularized the use of the term Tractatus de herbis to describe the texts contained in numerous codexes from the 13th and 14th centuries, and to distinguish them from the Circa instans from which they deriver. He confirms the centrality of ms. Egerton 747 and identifies a more or less contemporary derivative version transmitted by a codex from the Bibliothèque nationale de France - Latin manuscript 6823. Baumann also proposes a division of the various Tractatus into two categories: the \"Northern Italian Group\" (Oberitalienische Gruppe) and the \"French Manuscripts\" (Französische Handschriften). The latter include the numerous Livre des simples médecines from the 15th century, including the Modenese manuscript studied by Jules Camus, and are in turn divided by Baumann into three groups according to the order of the sentences in their incipit5.\nThis classification was called into question by François Avril when he published a critical edition of the French text contained in ms. 12322 of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Instead, the French art historian proposed two main geographical groupings: manuscripts from Northern France and the Burgundian states, and those from Western France. These conclusions are partially contradicted by the work of Belgian historian Carmélia Opsomer, author of a two-volume edition of a Brussels manuscript likely to have originated in southern France. These works demonstrate that Livre des simples médecines are more numerous than those taken into account by previous researchers, and that they deserve to be classified not only according to their iconography but also in relation to the redaction of the text they contain.\nIn the 21st century, the figurative cycle of the Tractatus de herbis was the subject of a detailed chapter in Minta Collins' book on the illustrative traditions of medieval herbariums. The American researcher does not question the classifications proposed by Baumann and Avril, but argues for a Campanian origin for the two oldest manuscripts. Her work is complemented by Vera Segre Rutz's analysis of the illustrative corpus of ms. 459 from the Casanatense library, which identifies the influence of North Italian manuscripts on the artistic production of the Visconti court. In 2006, Jean Givens analyzed the evolution of the transmission of medical and botanical knowledge through the study of three versions of the Tractatus de herbis: ms. Egerton 747 from London, a Livre des simples médecines from the Royal Library in Copenhagen and a printed edition by Grete Herball. While most research has focused on iconography alone, in 2009 Iolanda Ventura published the first critical edition of the Latin text contained in ms. Egerton 747. Her analysis highlights the relationship between the Tractatus de herbis and other redactions of the Circa instans, as well as with the main pharmacological sources of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe Tractatus de herbis exists in two distinct versions, transmitted by the two oldest manuscripts in the tradition: the version by \"Pseudo-Barthélémy Mini de Sienne\", contained in ms. Egerton 747 in the British Library, and the version by Manfred de Monte Imperiale, present in ms. Latin 6823 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Each of these has given rise to copies, derived versions, and vernacular translations.\n\n\n=== Egerton Manuscript 747 and derivatives ===\n\nThe Tractatus de herbis contained in manuscript Egerton 747 in London's British Library is the earliest evidence of the treatise, and may be the original version from which all the others derive. It occupies the first 109 folios of the codex, which also contains other texts, including a Nicolas Antidotary. The treaty is signed by a man named Barthélémy Mini from Siena.\nOn the basis of its illustrative corpus and Gothic script, the manuscript itself is dated to a period between the last quarter of the 13th century and the first decades of the 14th century. Source analysis of the Tractatus, however, shows no use of works from after 1250, and it is possible that the work was copied from an earlier codex, or that it is based on a pre-existing text, probably unillustrated, the trace of which has been lost. The absence of references to Matthew Silvaticus's Opus pandectarum medicinae offers a potential terminus ante quem for the treatise: Silvaticus's medico-botanical encyclopedia, dedicated in 1317 to Robert d'Anjou, was a great success and was widely used by teachers at the Salerno school. It is unlikely that the Tractatus was written after this date, and that its author would have been unaware of the existence of such a source or chosen not to include it in his compilation. The geographical origin of ms. Egerton 747 is also obscure: some authors have suggested that it was compiled in Tuscany, more precisely in Sienne, while others consider it to have originated in southern Italy, in the Naples or Salerno region. These attempts at localization are all based on the illustrations in the manuscript, as the text itself offers no clues as to its origin, and it may have been written in any part of the Italian peninsula, then copied into the codex. Whatever its exact provenance, the manuscript quickly crossed the Alps and must have been in French hands at a fairly early date. Indeed, there is an abridged version of the treaty translated into Occitan around 1350, and a direct copy of the manuscript made in Bresse in 1458. The numerous accounts of the French edition known as the Livre des simples médecines also seem to derive from a single translation of a text very similar to that of the London manuscript.\nTwo clues suggest that the Tractatus de herbis in ms. Egerton 747 is an original compilation. Firstly, extracts from Isaac Israeli were added to the margins of the manuscript after the first draft, whereas these passages are integrated into the body of the text and quoted in the summaries of later versions. In addition, the last folios of the treatise are ruled only at the top of the columns, to allow for the insertion of illustrations and to prevent paint from accumulating in the recessed lines. This adaptation of the illumination process, which took place in the course of production, indicates a close collaboration between the scribe and the illustrators, which could be the sign of an original figurative undertaking, rather than the copying of an existing work.\n\n\n==== Provençal translation ====\n\nIn Manuscript Palatino 586 from the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence, each folio features four images surmounted by three to six lines of text, rarely one or two, in Occitan, with abbreviations. They correspond to condensed translations of each chapter of the ms. Egerton 747. The incomplete codex was produced in two separate campaigns. It opens with a series of quatrains containing the Dits de philosophes, at the bottom of which the copyist gives his name (\"Aguiton\") in a Latin formula common among medieval scribes: \"Nomen scriptoris: aguito plenus amoris \"ref 4. This is followed by portraits of seven \"doctors\" delivering aphorisms in Latin and Occitan (see below). Folios 9 to 29 contain the first series of simples, which follow the chapter order of ms. Egerton 747. The plants are surrounded by figures and grotesques. The first part of the manuscript, which dates from the middle of the 14th century, ends with the letter F. Folios 30 to 65 contain only images, and from folio 38 onwards, only preparatory drawings in black line are present. This second illustration campaign was carried out using a different technique and in a style similar to that of Jean de Sy's Master of the Bible. This illuminator would have appeared during the last years of the reign of John the Good, and would have frequently worked for Charles V. It is therefore possible that ms. Pal. 586 was brought to Paris from the South of France to be decorated for a royal patron in the years 1370–1375.\n\n\n==== Bresse copy ====\n\nManuscript alfa.l.09.28 (formerly ms. Lat. 993) from the Estense Library in Modena is a 15th-century Latin version, very close to that of ms. Egerton 747, and the first to be given the title Tractatus de herbis. It even contains the explicit with the (usurped) signature of Barthélémy Mini de Sienne, whose surname was mistranscribed as \"Mundsens\" in the library catalogue. The treatise includes 390 images of plants, 50 of minerals and other substances, often depicted in boxes, and 22 unframed illuminated scenes. The illustrator may have been the Master of the Prince of Piedmont, an artist known for his work for the future Duke Amédée IX of Savoy. The last folio of the treatise includes a second explicit in French, following the one already present in ms. Egerton 747, which provides information on the provenance of the manuscript (Bourg-en-Bresse), the date of its completion (1458) and the name of its copyist (\"Le petit pelous\"):Explicit this herbology\nTo which an affair has been made\nIn bourg it was script\nOne thousand fifty and eight\nAnd wrote it all certain\nThe owner with his hand\nPlease pray for him\nFor the love of your company\n\n- Le petit pelous, etc., 1458\n\n\n=== Central European Kräuterbuch ===\n\nIn addition to the two groups of manuscripts defined by Felix Baumann, an abridged version of the Tractatus de herbis has been transmitted by two manuscripts from the Germanic cultural area. It is limited to substances of plant origin and has been purged of all medical data, retaining only lexicographical information. The text, which is accompanied by illustrations, is comparable to the ms. Egerton 747.\nOne of these Kräuterbuch (\"Book of Herbs\"), comprising just 200 chapters, is contained in ms. K II 11 of the Basel University Library. It was the subject of a critical edition in 1961, which dated it to the end of the 14th century based on the costume worn by the character in its only figurative scene. In 1990, however, the discovery of a second manuscript rendered this initial analysis obsolete: the \"Petroneller Kräuterbuch\", so nicknamed because it was kept in the library of the castle of the Counts of Abensberg-Traun in Petronell, Austria, turns out to be the model for the Basel manuscript and dates from the mid-15th century6. The codex was sold at auction at Sotheby's in 1985 and is now in private hands. The codex has a specificity for the history of the transmission of the Tractatus de herbis: an anonymous reader at the end of the 15th century inserted between the pages additional folios with the complete translation of the text into German, in a dialect of the Austro-Bavarian group.\n\n\n=== Latin manuscript 6823 and Northern Italian group ===\n\nLatin manuscript 6823 at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris contains a version of the Tractatus de herbis, entitled \"Liber de herbis et plantis\", which is different from that of ms. Egerton 747. Its signature indicates that it was written and illustrated by Manfred de Monte Imperiale, an unknown author whose origin is the subject of debate. The work could not be precisely dated, and would have been written between the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century. However, the terminus post quem date of 1296 has been retained, due to the presence of extracts from Simon of Genoa's Clavis sanationis, which appeared no later than that year. The geographical origin of Latin ms. 6823 is as much debated as that of ms. Egerton 747, although the illustrations on the preface folios may point to a Neapolitan production (see below). Apart from the Paris manuscript, the \"Manfred version\" was transmitted by four other codices dating from the 15th century: mss. Ross. 1067 and Chigi F. VIII. 188 from the Vatican Apostolic Library, ms. L. VIII. 18 from the Biblioteca comunale degli Intronati in Sienae and ms. Thott 191 2° from the Royal Library in Copenhagen, which is incomplete and lacks illustrations.\nManfred's writing sweeps across a more varied cultural horizon than Pseudo-Barthélémy Mini's. The link between the two works has not yet been elucidated and is the subject of debate among scholars. They agree in drawing parallels between the illustrative corpus of the London and Paris codices. The text, on the other hand, shows differences that make the hypothesis of a direct relationship between the two manuscripts unlikely. If Manfred had ms. Egerton 747 on his desk, he would have consciously and systematically replaced the content of certain chapters with texts taken from other sources (see below). Another explanation is that he used a version of the treatise containing illustrations derived from that of the London manuscript, but a substantially different text. A third hypothesis is that both versions are descended from a common archetype, which would have undergone distinct developments.\nWhatever the answer to this question, Manfred's version represents an essential step in the history of the transmission of the Tractatus de herbis and the extended, illustrated versions of Circa instans. Having probably been found in Lombardy as early as the second half of the 14th century, it served as the basis for some of the most famous accounts of the work, collected by Baumann under the name of the \"Northern Italian group \" . This migration from the south of the peninsula, if Latin ms. 6823 was indeed produced in this region, is the subject of an elaborate hypothesis: the manuscript may have belonged to Francesco da Carrara, lord of Padua from 1350 onwards. This acquisition is perhaps linked to the gradual transfer of Salerno's center of medical knowledge and teaching northwards, first to Bologna, then to Padua through the efforts of the House of Carrara to develop its university. When the city was taken by Jean Galéas Visconti in 1388, books were listed as spoils of war, and in 1426 the Latin ms. 6823 was mentioned in the catalog of the Library of the Dukes of Milan. A few years later, Francesco's son Francesco II commissioned a superb manuscript known as the Carrara Herbarium, whose images were partly inspired by Manfred's treatise. Unable to physically recover his father's books, Francesco II may have attempted to replace the loss by creating a new illuminated manuscript.\n\n\n==== Padua and Lombardy picture books ====\n\nThe oldest manuscript in the Northern Italian group appears to be ms. M. 873 from the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, entitled Compendium Salernitanum. It is unusual in that it contains only illustrations, although a separate volume with text may have existed. The 488 images, all by the same hand, follow the order of those in Manfred's version. The chapters without illustrations are not represented, but the New York manuscript includes, alongside the simple ones, the animals from the Liber medicinae ex animalibus. Analysis of the costumes and handwriting has enabled us to place its origin in northern Italy, probably in the Veneto region, and to date it to the third quarter of the 14th century. As indicated in a note on folio 94, the codex belonged to Marcellin-Hercule Bompart, physician to Louis XIII, whose library was subsequently passed on to Antoine Vallot, archiatrist to Louis XIV. Many titles are translated into French in cursive script of the 15th or 16th century.\nA second, textless manuscript is held by the library of the École nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the Masson number 116. A hard-to-decipher note at the bottom of the first folio, as well as several iconographic clues, link the codex to the city of Padua. The 580 illustrations, whose uneven level reflects the participation of several artists, are presented in an order now disrupted by a clumsy restoration of the binding and which does not correspond to the original sequence. Unlike the Morgan Library manuscript, ms. Masson 116 was not originally designed to contain images only: the folios show traces of a discreet pen and ink rule, and the trees are placed in the center of the pages to allow the insertion of two columns of text. The details of the costumes and certain scenes show many similarities with the illustrations of a Guiron le Courtois and a Lancelot du Lac transmitted by two Parisian manuscripts, suggesting that they may have come from the same workshop, and have made it possible to date ms. Masson 116 to the years 1370 or 1380. The work of some of the manuscript's illustrators also corresponds closely to the stylistic canons of Altichiero da Zevio or Jacopo Avanzi, two artists who worked in Padua between 1376 and 1379.\n\nAlthough apparently unintentional, the absence of text in ms. Masson 116 seems to have served a remarkable tendency in the 15th and 16th centuries to prefer picture books to scientific treatises. The École des Beaux-Arts manuscript, or a copy of it, thus served as the basis for two books designed to feature only illustrations. The first is ms. Chigi F. VII. 158 from the Vatican Apostolic Library, dated to the late 14th or early 15th century. Although it is labelled \"Latin Dioscorides\" and has been studied as such, the codex contains only images belonging to the figurative tradition of the Tractatus de herbis. The second is British Library manuscript Sloane 4016, whose illustrations are almost identical copies of those on ms. Masson 116, but adjusted and grouped to fill the entire surface of the folios. They are accompanied by captions indicating the name of the simple and its synonyms, and feature scenes that indicate a clear predilection on the part of their patron for courtly and worldly aspects, testifying to a realization with a primarily aesthetic purpose. Details of costumes and hairstyles have been altered from the original and have been used to date the manuscript to the 1440s, by comparison with the frescoes attributed to the Zavattari in the chapel of Queen Theodelinde in Monza Cathedral. The link with this family of Lombard painters, as well as the presence of Visconti emblems, would place the origin of ms. Sloane 4016 to Pavia or Milan. Other authors, however, have suggested a Venetian production around 1450.\nSome of the illustrations in ms. Masson 116 still appear in a distinct 15th-century tradition commonly referred to as \"alchemical herbariums\", of which there are around twenty manuscripts originating in Italy. The best-known examples are ms. 106 from the botanical library of the University of Florence and ms. Aldini 211 from the University Library of Pavie both of which have been the subject of detailed studies. These codices are divided into two parts: the first presenting 98 illustrated \"alchemical\" plants, and the second containing a selection of images from the Tractatus de herbis tradition, interspersed with texts.\n\n\n==== Historia plantarum: a sum for Wenceslas ====\n\nIt was at the court of the Visconti family that the most luxurious version of Manfred's treatise was produced: ms. 459 from the Casanatense library in Rome, otherwise known as the Historia plantarum, is a grandiose edition of over 900 entries that represents the pinnacle of medieval scientific illustration. Its design and border decoration correspond to the style employed by Giovannino and Salomone de' Grassi for the Book of Hours commissioned by Jean Galéas Visconti. It is likely that the Historia plantarum was produced in the same workshop, by the same artists and for the same patron39. The representation of plant species follows in the tradition of the Tractatus de herbis, and closely resembles that of ms. Masson 116, which could suggest an archetype common to both manuscripts. On the other hand, that of the animals and figurative scenes differs markedly: it corresponds more closely to the studies carried out in the de' Grassi workshop, and has many points in common with the contemporary production of the Tacuinum sanitatis illustrated in the Lombard region.\nThe manuscript may date from the period 1394–1395, when Jean Galéas was trying to persuade the King of the Romans to invest him with the Duchy of Milan in exchange for financial support. Wenceslas of Luxembourg, to whom the work was presented, is depicted on the frontispiece surrounded by his electors and the seven virtues. The latter may be an allusion to the title of Count of Vertus conferred on Jean Galéas after his marriage to Isabelle de France. The manuscript was later inherited by the famous library of King Matthias Corvin in Hungary, who had his coat of arms placed over that of the House of Luxembourg on the same frontispiece.\nA copy of the Historia plantarum was produced in the 15th century during this stay in Hungary. Transmitted by ms. Cim. 79 (formerly ms. 604 2°) of the University Library of Munich, and known as the Lexicon plantarum, it was essentially limited to simple plants. Written in bastard Latin script, the manuscript was probably originally intended for a hospital.\n\n\n=== Books of simple medicines and printed works ===\n\nThe Tractatus de herbis was translated into French, commonly known as the Livre des simples médecines, at the end of the 14th century or the beginning of the 15th century. In France, this period corresponds to the transition from Latin to the vernacular of many scientific and philosophical works. The vernacular version was transmitted by at least 28 manuscripts, alternately titled Livre des secrets de Salerne or Arboriste. The earliest date from the second quarter of the 15th century, and the majority from the second half of that century. The Livre des simples médecines is clearly derived from the Pseudo-Barthélémy Mini version: it contains the same chapters, presented in the same sequence, and strictly adheres to alphabetical order, even when the transition to French would have required otherwise. It does, however, show certain specific features that might suggest that the original translation was not based on ms. Egerton 747, but from another codex containing a derived version, closer to that of Modè's ms. alfa.l.09.28. Finally, while the stemma codicum of the Livre des simples médecines tends to indicate a unique archetype, the original translation developed over time and evolved into several sub-editions, according to what its copyists felt authorized to add or subtract. Some of these contain extracts from the work of the Italian physician Gentile da Foligno and the Tacuinum sanitatis, two sources absent from earlier versions of treatise.\n\n\n==== Large meadows ====\n\nIt was precisely one of these redactions that was used to produce the first printed herbarium in the French language: published in Besançon in 1486 or 1487–1488, it was entitled Arbolayre contenant la qualitey et virtus, proprietey des herbes, arbres, gommes et semences, extrait de pluseurs tratiers de medicine, comment d'Avicenne, de Rasis, de Constantin, de Ysaac et Plateaire, selon le commun usaige bien correct. The work is a large folio in Gothic script on two columns, which was reprinted in Paris at least twice, in 1498 and 1520, this time under the name Grant Herbier en françoys. The woodcuts in these works no longer follow the iconographic tradition of the Tractatus de herbis, but seem to have been borrowed from the Gart der Gesundheit, the first herbarium printed in German, published in Mainz in 1485. L'Arbolayre's text has a number of remarkable features that distinguish it from all versions derived from the Tractatus de herbis and the Livre des simples médecines, such as the presence of chapters absent elsewhere. As it seems unlikely that the editor himself would have taken the initiative of making such additions to an existing work, this means that the manuscript at the source of these impressions has yet to be determined.\nThe Grant Herbarium was in turn translated into English as The Grete Herball and published several times between 1526 and 1561. The work is dedicated to \"the perfect knowledge and understanding of all kinds of herbs and their gracious virtues\" and incorporates a number of novelties: a register of chapters in Latin and English, an anatomical diagram showing the names of different human bones, a section devoted to 25 treatments presented as \"innovative\" or a treatise on urine attributed to Avicenna.\n\n\n== Text ==\n\n\n=== Material processed ===\n\nThe Tractatus de herbis consists of an alphabetical compilation of over 500 simples, each chapter devoted to the description of a different product. The enumeration begins after a short prologue from Circa instans, which explains that a simple medicine is a substance used as found in nature, without additions or modifications. Each initial begins with a summary, which does not always correspond exactly to the products actually processed. Within the same alphabetical section, the chapters follow a sequence that does not respect alphabetical order, but seems dictated by the sources used for compilation. The treatise is mainly made up of plants and substances of plant origin, but also includes several simple animals (such as ambergris, castoreum and musk) and minerals (such as mercury, orpiment and magnetite). It also contains a number of processed products, such as starch, butter, vinegar and... mummies.\nThe internal organization of the chapters varies according to the sources used. Those taken from Circa instans, however, all share a similar structure: they begin by mentioning the qualities of the simple (hot or cold, dry or wet) and their degree of intensity, then provide lexicographical information, such as synonyms and sometimes the etymology of the name, and finally indicate the substance's secondary qualities (astringent action) as well as the mood it serves to regulate (blood, phlegm, bile, atrabile). After this introduction, which constitutes a kind of \"identity card\" for the product, the text goes on to list its various therapeutic properties. These are grouped by body part, often following a sequence a capite ad calcem (\"from head to heel\").\n\n\n=== Authors ===\nThe colophon of ms. Egerton 747, copied in full in the Modena manuscript, cites Diascorides (Dioscorides), Platone (Appuleius Platonicus), Galienus (Galien) and Macronem (Macer Floridus) as authors of the treatise, and mentions the name of \"Bartholomeus Mini de Senis\" as compiler and scribe:\n\n« Explicit tractatus h[e]rbar[um] Diascorides &\nPlatone adq[ue] Galienus et Macrone[m] tra[n]s\nlatate manu et i[n]tellectu bartholomei mini\nd[e] senis i[n] arte speciare se[m]p[er] i[n]fusus d[e]o gra[tia]s am[en].\nQ[u]i scripsit scribat se[m]p[er] cu[m] d[omi]no vivat.\n\nVivat i[n] celis bartho[lo]m[eu]s i[n] no[m]i[n]e felix.»\"Barthélémy Mini de Sienne\", of whom no other work is known, has been identified as an apothecary, \"versed in the art of spices\". Jules Camus suggested that he was related to Andrea Mino da Siena, a 14th-century Tuscan poet of the Piccolomini family. The name Bartholomeus Mini was also found with his coat of arms on the ceiling of a salon in Siena's Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, dated no earlier than 1347. A Bartalomeo d'Antonio di Mino, a resident of the Terzo di Camollìa, is also mentioned several times between 1453 and 1474 in the lists of the Sienese apothecaries' guild, but this late connection is unlikely.\nOtto Pächt points out, however, that the two mentions of the name in the colophon are later additions, written in a similar but different script and with darker ink. It is also unlikely that the compiler and scribe of the text were the same person, and that the latter signed twice. The abbreviation \"barthoms\" is used to fill a nine-character space in a formula (\"Qui scripsit...\") that was very common among medieval scribes. The reason for this probable usurpation remains unknown, but it is possible that Bartholomew Mini of Siena made several corrections and additions to the original text, and that he considered these modifications sufficient justification for substituting his name for those of the compiler and scribe.\n\nOn the other hand, the attribution of the Tractatus de herbis in the Paris ms. 6823 to Manfred de Monte Imperiale is indisputable. The incipit of the treatise contains his original signature: \"Cum ego, Manfredus de Monte Imperiali, in artis speciarie semper optans scire virtutes [...] in libro hoc scripsi et per figuram demonstravi.\" The name does not appear in any other source, however, and nothing is known of the author beyond what he himself says in this passage, i.e. that he is a medical scholar with a thorough knowledge of the existing literature on simple medicines and first-hand experience with plants and their medicinal properties. The toponym \"Monte Imperiale\" has been likened to Kaysersberg in Alsace, Poggibonsi (formerly Poggio Imperiale) near Sienne, or Castel del Monte in Puglia, a castle built by Emperor Federico II.\n\nFor François Avril, Manfred and Barthélémy belonged \"to a still little-known milieu of herbalists in the Sienese region\", while for Minta Collins, both authors worked in the South. Manfred would have commissioned Neapolitan artists to illuminate the frontispiece and incipit of his work (see below), having compiled it during his stay in Salerno. The explicit title would also indicate the author's attachment to the teachings of the famous medical school:\" Ne vero presentis operis prolixitas in immensum infundatur, haec leto fine illud concludimus. Actenus Arcanum Salerne diximus urbis littera et in lassa pollice sistat opus.\"\n\"In order to prevent the prolixity of this work from becoming too long, we close it with pleasure. Thus far, we have spoken of the secrets of Salerno, and the work ends with weary handwriting and a [tired] thumb.\"The reference to \"the secrets of Salerno\" is present in a shortened form in French in the Livre des simples médecines, and has often been used as an alternative title for the work. However, it is already present in ms. Egerton 747, as well as in several versions of Circa instans, even though they were written far from Salerno.\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe chapters of Pseudo-Bartholomew Mini's Tractatus de herbis offer a pharmacological compilation typical of the field of knowledge of a mid-thirteenth-century expert in medicine and therapeutics. The author was probably not a university-educated intellectual, as the collection shows no influence of the academic sources typical of the period, such as Avicenna's Canon. Rather, it is representative of \"popular\" medicine, based on sources circulating in the Salernitan cultural milieu and on texts typical of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. The compilation's methodology is relatively simple to reproduce: each alphabetical section begins with the chapters of the Circa instans, presented in the same sequence as in the original work. These are followed by additional chapters drawn from other sources, often grouped together according to their provenance. The internal structure of the chapters follows three distinct typologies:\n\nPerfect reproduction, without modifications or additions, from a single source;\nInterpolation of the content of one source within the data of another;\nMixed chapters\", in which several sources are used to describe different properties of the substance.\n\n\n==== Salerno heritage: Circa instans ====\n\nAlthough Platearius is not cited in the treatise's colophon, the Circa instans is the main source of the text. Compiled in the mid-11th century by a member of Salerno's medical school, the work is one of the main texts on medieval pharmacology, which was distributed throughout Europe, and of which nearly 200 manuscripts have been preserved. Its title derives from the prologue, which begins with the phrase \"Circa instans negotium in simplicibus medicinis\". The traditional attribution to Matthew Platearius, a semi-legendary figure, has now been refuted by most scholars. The question of the sources of Circa instans is made particularly difficult by the almost total absence of references or mentions of the authors consulted. Nevertheless, the treatise is certainly based on the pharmacopoeia of Constantine the African, derived from his Latin translations of Arabic medical texts. The prologue and all the chapters of the Circa instans are included in the Tractatus de herbis, which differentiates it from the other sources of the treatise, which appear only as extracts. It also dictates the overall structure of the compilation, and transfers to it the essence of the Salernitan therapeutic tradition. Other texts typical of the school's pharmacopoeia are conspicuous by their absence: barely a handful of chapters can be compared with the antidotaries of the Liber iste and Antidotarium Nicolai, or with the glossary of the Alphita, but these are only vague reminiscences that could very well have come from glosses in other sources.\nAmong the numerous redactions of the Circa instans, the one contained in ms. 674 of the Erlangen university library, with 252 entries, is the one that bears the closest resemblance to the Pseudo-Barthélémy Mini text. The latter was probably written later, as shown by the inclusion under the initial S of several additional chapters placed at the end of the treatise in the Erlangen codex. The manuscript is not precisely dated, but it postdates other versions of Platearius' text produced in the first half of the thirteenth century, providing a terminus post quem to the compilation of the Tractatus. The similarities and differences between the Erlangen and London manuscripts suggest the existence of an intermediate edition between the two works. Several chapters are taken from Constantine the African's Liber de gradibus, and it is possible that the anonymous compiler of the Tractatus, rather than having extracted them on his initiative, simply copied them from an amplified version of the Circa instans, now lost.\n\n\n==== Alto-medieval tradition: Pseudo-Apulée ====\n\nThe second main source of the Tractatus is the Herbarius of \"Pseudo-Apulée\", a herbarium compiled in Latin in the 4th century and artificially attributed to Apulée of Madaure. Based on Greek and Latin sources, in particular Pliny the Elder and Pliny's Medicine, the Herbarius comprises 131 illustrated chapters, each devoted to a distinct plant. It exists in two different versions and has been preserved in numerous manuscripts, often accompanied by other short texts from late antiquity, such as the anonymous Liber de taxone, the Liber medicinae ex animalibus by Sextus Placitus, the Ex herbis femininis by Pseudo-Dioscorides or the Liber de herba vettonica, wrongly attributed to Antonius Musa to increase its authority. The latter is entirely devoted to the therapeutic properties of Betony, and serves as a partial source for the \"De bectonica\" chapter of the Tractatus dedicated to this plant. These compendia were immensely popular between the life and the tenth century, thanks to their conciseness, simple, accessible structure and easy-to-understand form, devoid of excessive technical terms. The subsequent distribution of the Herbarius is less well documented: it is likely that by the thirteenth century, the treatise was no longer part of the reference texts, but rather part of the baggage of sources that dominated popular medicine.\nIn the Tractatus de herbis, 49 chapters are copied directly from the work of the Pseudo-Apuleius, and in a further 32 cases, extracts are used to interpolate the contents of the Circa instans. The Alto-medieval herbarium is not, however, evenly represented: its last thirty chapters are virtually absent from the compilation, which might suggest that the copy used was not complete. It's also interesting to note that in the case of extrapolations, only the list of synonyms for the substance is included. This is a strange lexicographical approach, as most of these names were no longer in use at the time the Tractatus was compiled, and is perhaps explained by the fascination they still exerted in popular culture. By inserting these synonyms, the author would have chosen to provide accessory elements of no practical use, presented as precious and exotic rarities.\n\n\n==== Dietary supplements: Isaac Israeli ====\n\nThe last important source of the Tractatus de herbis has no connection with medicine and pharmacology: it is the De diaetis particularibus, a Galenic-inspired treatise on nutrition and dietetics. Written in Kairouan in the 10th century by the Jewish physician and philosopher Isaac Israeli, the work was translated into Latin by Constantine the African and forms part of the typical corpus of medical texts of the Salerno school. While the Tractatus de herbis is not the first amplified version of the Circa instans to include extracts from Isaac's work, the modality of these extrapolations is very specific: they are mostly written in a smaller script inserted in the empty spaces of the columns or in the margins. Although in the same hand as the main text, these extracts are undoubtedly later additions. They sometimes simply enrich the information on a substance taken from another source, but in some cases they also form separate entries, absent from the alphabetical summaries. In all, De diaetis particularibus represents the source of 60 chapters scattered throughout the treatise. Their particular form could be proof that the London manuscript is not a copy but an original arrangement. Later versions of the Tractatus de herbis integrate the dietetic chapters into the body of the text and cite them in the summaries opening each alphabetical section, which could indicate that they are directly derived from ms. Egerton 747.\n\n\n=== Other sources ===\n\nCompared with the massive use of the Circa instans and the Herbarius, and the special place of the De diaetis, the role of other sources is rather limited. Only three chapters are taken from Macer Floridus's De viribus herbarum, a botanical poem composed in France at the end of the eleventh century. It is, however, used on numerous occasions, not as a reference text, but to introduce specific information into the text of another source. Macer Floridus is also the only source in the Tractatus that is systematically cited as such: passages copied from De viribus herbarum are thus introduced by phrases such as \"Et etiam dicit Macro, quod multas habet virtutes, [...]\" (\"And Macer, who has many virtues, says [...]\").\nThe anonymous compiler of the Tractatus still alludes to the authority of Dioscorides, and it is clear that many passages in the text are taken from De materia medica. The question of which of the many forms, direct and indirect, in which the ancient text circulated in the 13th century, was used remains unresolved. Nevertheless, several chapters bear similarities to the text of the alphabetical Latin Dioscorides of the xieme century, which is the alphabetical rearrangement of the Latin translation of the xieme century, enriched by several additions.\nFinally, of the more than 500 chapters in the treatise, around a hundred have no identified sources. For the most part, they are grouped together at the end of each alphabetical section, which may reflect the compiler's desire to separate them from the other chapters. Some may have been extracted from appendices to other texts, of which we have lost track. The chapter \"De hecino\", for example, bears some resemblance to a text appended to a Florentine codex that also includes a Pseudo-Apuleius and a Pseudo-Dioscorides. But many other chapters have a very particular form that leads to another explanation: they are written in a less rigid style and in a language showing significant Romanesque influences; they also contain a description of the plant that always corresponds perfectly to that of the illustration. It has therefore been hypothesized that they derive not from written sources, but from oral tradition. If this is the case, the Tractatus de herbis should be redefined not as a scholarly compilation, but as a vade mecum combining data from medical manuals with pharmaco-botanical practice.\n\n\n==== Further amplifications ====\n\nThe original text of the Tractatus de herbis, that of ms. Egerton 747 or an earlier version no longer extant, has been the subject of two successive amplifications that form distinct redactions including other sources. Manfred de Monte Imperiale's version makes more extensive and detailed use of the pharmaco-botanical literature available at the end of the thirteenth century: the author includes Arabic medical science, represented by Avicenna's Canon and the Liber aggregatus in medicinis simplicibus by Pseudo-Serapion. He also makes use of Simon of Genoa's Clavis sanationis, a dictionary of Latin, Greek and Arabic medical terminology. Finally, Manfred reappropriates Dioscorides' medical material, using a version that does not fully correspond to the alphabetical Latin Dioscorides. The extracts attributable to the physician of Anazarb are much more numerous and developed than in the version of ms. Egerton 747, and are systematically substituted for those of the Pseudo-Apuleius. The chapters based on Isaac Israeli's De diaetis are perfectly inserted into the body of the text and often accompanied by an illustration, which was lacking in the London manuscript. The management of images is not homogeneous: most alphabetical sections open with entries already present in the Pseudo-Barthélémy Mini version and are accompanied by illustrations inspired by them. Added to this central core is a series of images unique to Manfred's version, whose model has not been determined. Finally, the sections end with unillustrated chapters dedicated to mineral and animal substances, or little-known plants cited by Dioscorides or Avicenna. Manfred's superior erudition is finally perceptible in the treatment of several entries originally based on oral tradition: the author retains the substance's common name, but replaces the chapter's content with written sources, mainly from the work of Dioscoride. He thus proceeds, in a method that might be described as \"pre-scientific\", to identify certain plant species mentioned in ancient sources, and offers their authority a kind of \"actualization\".\n\nMore than a century later, Manfred's Tractatus de herbis can be found in the Visconti library in Milan. The earliest catalog of this collection, entitled Consignatio librorum and dated 1426, actually indicates the presence of two copies of the text: the one now preserved in ms. Latin 6823 in Paris (catalog entry no. 923) and a second, now lost (no. 492). He also mentions two Circa instans (nos. 458 and 768), an alphabetical Dioscorides (no. 780), several volumes of Avicenna's Canon (nos. 481, 487, 489, 491, 801 and 802) and Isaac Israeli's De diaetis particularibus (no. 431). A few decades earlier, the anonymous author of the Historia plantarum certainly had access to this rich library to produce the most imposing version of the cycle. He used the structure established by the Tractatus to complete a compilation of over 900 chapters based on the same sources as those used by Manfred, but exploited in a broader way. The author has also reorganized the chapters, abandoning the \"block\" arrangement of each initial in favor of strict alphabetical order. A notable exception is the chapter dedicated to gold, \"Aurum\", which should logically have closed the section with the initial A, but is kept in first position below the frontispiece. This choice betrays a tendency to seek prestige on the part of a compiler who also made a selection among the entries in the Parisian version to retain only \"noble\" substances (perfumes, spices, exotic plants and fruits), as well as those that could be easily illustrated. Chapters on the nature of animals are also included in the midst of those dealing with simples (see below). They are taken from the Liber medicinae ex animalibus by Sextus Placitus, but also from the Cyranides, a collection of late antique hermetic works. This singular combination of pharmacopoeia, dietetics and magic is indicative of the nature of the Historia plantarum: the work was probably not a medical-botanical encyclopedia, but rather a work intended for a courtly audience curious about the wonders of the natural world.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nDue to its composite nature, the Tractatus de herbis exhibits considerable linguistic variability: the various sources used to compile it are integrated into it while respecting both the content and the form of their original texts. The language used in the treatise thus varies substantially from chapter to chapter, depending on whether they are taken from the Circa instans (written in simple but correct Latin), the Herbarius (a work that testifies to a phase of decline in classical Latin) or other sources. The sections that probably originated in oral tradition (see above), on the other hand, are deeply influenced by the vulgar language and perhaps even Italian. It is also remarkable that the copyist of ms. Egerton 747, who was not the compiler of the text, had only a very partial understanding of what he was writing, as evidenced by the very many errors present throughout the treatise. These are particularly glaring in the poor transcription of scientific abbreviations, which should have been familiar to any medical experte. This tendency reaches a climax in the extracts from De diaetis, where the scribe seems to understand neither the technical vocabulary nor even the logical meaning of the sentences.\nOn the phonetic level, the language used to write the treatise does not show all the features that usually characterize medieval Latin. While the classical diphthongs ' ae ' and ' oe ' are systematically changed to ' e ', the transformation of the ' ti ' group into ' ci ' (e.g. vitium, \"the defect\", into vicium), though typical of the medieval language, is not applied. For other phenomena, the text shows a certain graphic uncertainty, with two different forms sometimes coexisting for the same terms. This is the case for the oppositions ' ph ' / ' f ' (morphea and morfea, \"the morphea\"), ' x ' / ' s ' (axungia and asungia, \"the axonge\") or ' l ' / ' r ' (clister and crister, \"the clyster\"). This variability is particularly marked for technical terms, such as the names of diseases, plants or medical instruments: icterus is thus attested in the forms ictericia, yctericia and hictericia, and epilepsy is noted as epilentia, epilensia or epiletsia.\nAs far as morphology and syntax are concerned, the language in which the treatise was written is marked above all by the disappearance of the Latin grammatical case system. This can be seen in the loss of sensitivity to the function of the accusative (purgandi colera instead of purgandi coleram) and in the lack of concordance between prepositions and the cases that normally accompany them in the classical language. In chapter headings, for example, the preposition de (\"about\") is followed by the nominative rather than the ablative. The same applies to the prepositions contra (\"against\"), super (\"on\"), circa (\"around\") or propter (\"near\"), normally governed by the accusative. Another feature of the transition to Romance languages is the transformation of genders and the partial disappearance of the neuter. As in other contemporary texts, the neuter is often replaced by the feminine: for example, the neuter plural menstrua, \"menstruation\", becomes the feminine singular menstruam. The phenomenon can also be seen in the lack of concordance between noun and adjective (e.g. vinum [neuter] bibitus [masculine]), or in the indistinct use of gendered forms (qui, quae, quod) of the relative pronoun \"que \".\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nThe iconographic tradition of the Tractatus de herbis, which probably originated in ms. Egerton 747, represents an important innovation in medieval illustration. For the first time since the end of Antiquity, it reproduces botanical images rich in naturalistic observations. For Otto Pächt, this new tradition was not the result of a change in aesthetic credo, but rather was driven from outside the realm of art: it was the growing development of empirical science that adopted pictorial representation as a means of teaching.\n\n\n=== Plants ===\nThe Egerton ms. 747 contains 406 illustrations of plants, which Pächt has described as \"half-image, half-diagram \". There is no attempt at shading or modeling, and plants are represented schematically and strictly two-dimensionally. In a few rare cases, leaves, stems or branches overlap, intertwine or curve to show the plant's growth profile. However, the details of the leaves and flowers, and their arrangement on the stem, are depicted with sufficient accuracy that the plant can, in the majority of cases, be identified from the illustration alone. A number of techniques have been employed to provide pleasing and varied images and to accentuate the character of different species. This effect is created by the broad spectrum of green hues, as well as by the use of lighter and darker shades to represent leaf veins.\nAt least three stylistic groups of plants can be distinguished. Trees and shrubs from overseas or \"the Indies\", such as the incense tree (fig. A, bottom right), whose products reached Europe in dried form, are illustrated with images that bear no resemblance to their natural appearance. They are characterized by clean, fine lines and careful application of paint, and are well framed in the space of the column reserved for them. Familiar trees such as the fig tree (fig. B, right), with their more recognizable leaf shapes, are marked by a freer, bolder use of paint, and a more sketchy, less delicate style. Finally, common aromatic herbs such as coriander or chervil (fig. C) are depicted in a more precise, smaller and more schematic way. These groups suggest that the artists worked from sets of drawings, some invented for unknown plants, others composed of characteristic features but without proportion, and still others drawn from nature.\n\nWith regard to this third group, Felix Baumann suspects that the often two-dimensional representations of plants are based on pressed originals. The leaves of wild chicory (fig. D, left), which are naturally arranged in a rosette around the stem, are thus represented in a star shape as if they were a flattened specimen. However, the first evidence of the herbarium technique, collections of dried plants, is only known from the 16th century onwards, and if true, this hypothesis would bring the discovery forward by almost two centuries. The thesis is also of decisive importance for the question of the relationship between art and nature in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as it suggests a new form of knowledge production that focuses on the relationship between experimentation and the artist's experience beyond the copying of pictorial models. The Tractatus de herbis could thus be an unprecedented example of a painted hortus siccus, transferring into images the practices of collecting, pressing, preserving and classifying plants.\n\tExamples of simple illustrations in ms. Egerton 747.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn Latin ms. 6823, Manfred de Monte Imperiale draws largely on the illustrative corpus of the London manuscript, but manages to push the naturalistic rendering of images even further. For example, the layout of the folio devoted to officinal cress and serpentaria (fig. E and F) is very similar in the two codices, but in Manfred's version, the serpentaria is depicted with the spathe and leaves in profile, showing a prominence over the cress in proportion to the nature of the two plants. The schematic and frontal models of ms. Egerton 747 are thus adapted to show the leaves from different angles. The flowers and their different colors are also rendered with greater precision, and the relative size of the species is better rendered. Depending on whether the leaf is viewed from the front or the back, the veins appear as if sunken inwards or curved outwards, creating a strong haptic effect.\n\nThe work of the artists of the various Tractatus de herbis, is not necessarily objective. In the case of exotic plants, the illuminator has no choice but to use his imagination based on textual clues. Manfred's version includes one of the earliest representations of a banana tree in the West (fig. G, left). To accompany the chapter dedicated to the \"Tree of Paradise\", which is devoid of illustration in ms. Egerton 747, the painter followed the indications given by the text: the plant is described with leaves resembling those of the greater elecampane, but longer and broader, with long, thick branches and lemon-like fruits, whose sweet taste appeals to the gallbladder. The image is thus based on that of the elecampane (fig. H, left), but shows leaves enlarged by about a third and stems bearing yellowish, oval-shaped fruits. The latter are more reminiscent of melon or pumpkin than lemon, perhaps in an attempt to accentuate their sweetness87.\n\tExamples of simple illustrations in Latin ms. 6823.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe links between text and images are manifold, going beyond the mere explanation of botanical characteristics. At the same time, the interactions between the images themselves, although a priori dictated by alphabetical order, are also numerous. An interesting example of this phenomenon is provided by folio 163 ro of Latin ms. 6823, which presents vitriol, glass and viticella, the common sieve (fig. J). The plant's leaves, which are much larger in the lower part, taper upwards to reveal berries that are first red, then green in the upper part of the tendril. This illustration shows the whole process of growth and maturation of this climbing plant, whose main feature remains an oversized root divided into three branches. On one of these, a man is seated on a stool with a glassmaker's cane in his hand. He is part of the adjacent scene illustrating glassmaking in a furnace. Above him, a snake points to the sentence in the text indicating the poisonous nature of vitriol (see below). It forms both a side branch of the sieve and a rope from which the bell-shaped furnace hangs. This visual interplay creates new networks of relationships between the singles, dissolving dimensional relations and suggesting to the viewer that there is a possible link between them. This is established in the text by several indications: firstly, the recurring motif of the element fire as a means of transformation, which acts as a tertium comparationis of the three substances. The recipe for one remedy, for example, calls for the grated root to be burned with lard. Glass is also described as having a dual origin: from earth and a plant. One variety of vitriol, produced in Spain, is obtained by coagulation and separates into grape-like pieces. The immature berries of the Tamier tree are the same pale green as vitriol and glass samples from the kiln. The latter also shares the same bell shape as the copper sulfate piece. Some of these connections may be coincidental, but they are suggested by the painter's idiosyncratic composition and illustrate how the interplay between natural measurement and creative imagination gave birth to something entirely new.\n\n\n=== Minerals and animals ===\nIn ms. Egerton 747, simple products derived from animal or mineral substances are illustrated either by pen-and-ink sketches, or by figurative scenes showing the harvesting or extraction process. The latter feature poorly proportioned, crudely drawn figures, and stand out for their unprofessional appearance in comparison with the plant illustrations. However, these scenes have been copied throughout the iconographic tradition of the Tractatus de herbis to the point of constituting its main feature, and, once re-elaborated by more expert artists, have become far more attractive. In most manuscripts of the Book of Simple Medicines, figurative scenes receive special attention: they emphasize the detail of costumes, and depict lively poses and a plausible rendering of space.\n\tEvolution of the depiction of the extraction of the Armenian bowl (\"De bolo armenico\") from the Tractatus to the Book of Simple Medicines\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe London manuscript contains two hunting scenes marked by the illuminator's ignorance of the animals involved. Castoreum, a secretion from the beaver's glands, is interpreted as coming from its testicles: the mammal, depicted as a kind of deer, castrates itself with its own teeth in the hope of leaving hunters the product of their hunt. Musk-producing Asian chevrotains are also unrecognizable. The depiction of the ivory-supplying elephant (see above), although much more common in medieval art, is equally inaccurate: the animal resembles a pig with a trunk, short hair along the back, tusks that grow abruptly upwards and marked ribs. Latin ms. 6823 is scarcely richer or more accurate in its animal representations, but the Tractatus is followed by a short illustrated treatise dedicated to birds and fish. This is probably a reminiscence of a complete version of Sextus Placitus' Liber medicinae ex animalibus, a late antique text transmitted in the same medical corpus as Pseudo-Apuleius' Herbarius. In the manuscripts of the Northern Italian group derived from Manfred's version, the chapters of the text are integrated into the single chapters of the Tractatus in alphabetical order. Following a tradition common in herbariums, most manuscripts finally include numerous illustrations of snakes, spiders and scorpions. These are shown opposite paragraphs describing antidotes for their respective bites or stings.\n\n\n=== Doctores et magistri ===\n\nThe incipit pages of the Tractatus de herbis and the antidotary (see above) in ms. Egerton 747 are decorated with borders in a style and technique very different from the other illustrations. According to Minta Collins, they closely resemble the work of Jacobellus of Salerno, an illuminator active in the last years of the 13th century: curved tendrils in the corners form roundels containing heads or grotesques on a gold background, some with wings in the shape of small acanthus leaves. The colors (blue-gray, rust and madder enhanced with white) are also typical of the artist's illuminations. The initials of both texts feature busts of figures on a gold-leaf background. They are wearing the distinctive garb of university doctors in Italy at the end of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries: a cape lined and edged with petit-gris, a subtunic and a two-pointed cap on a white headdress. The straight, elongated lines of the noses and the pronounced treatment of the pupils also resemble the style used by Jacobellus to depict faces.\nLatin ms. 6823 also shows doctors in the initials of the incipits of the Tractatus (see above) and the Antidotarium. Their style has consistently been described as Northern Italian, and the illuminations attributed to artists from Bologna, Lombardy or Pisa. For Minta Collins, on the other hand, the two pages were likely commissioned from Lippo Vanni or one of his close associates. Although the painter is well documented as having been active in Siena in 1344, he may also have worked in Naples in the preceding years, which remains compatible with the thesis of the manuscript's southern origin. Two folios of the preface also contain pen-and-wash figures of famous medical authors, whose style has been compared to that of Roberto D'Oderisio's frescoes in the Santa Maria Incoronata church in Naples. A bearded figure in hooded robes is usually identified as Manfred himself, facing a group of doctors presenting him with plants to identify. The following folios show four pairs of famous doctors seated on benches and engaged in discussion, each identified by an aphorism taken from his works and forming like a phylactery. The first two represent Hippocrates and Johannitius, then Hippocrates and Galen, three classical authors whose works formed part of the basic corpus of the medical curriculum in Salerno and Naples. Next come Jean Mésué and Barthélémy of Salerno, then Averroès and Porphyre of Tyre, commentators on the former and on Aristotle. The ms. Palatino 586 from Florence begins with a comparable series of seven physicians: Adam, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Johannitius, Averroes, Jean Mésué and Serapion. It is possible that ms. Egerton 747 also began with portraits of medical authors that have not been preserved. \n\nIn subsequent manuscripts, the motif of medical men is often repeated in other forms. The ms. Chigi F. VII. 158 from the Vatican presents a very complete series, opening with a depiction of Dioscorides picking strawberries, opposite another unidentified figure. Thereafter, each alphabetical summary is accompanied by a full-length illustration of a scholar examining one of the simples presented on the folio, surmounted by the name of a famous medical author. Most are dressed in long, brightly colored garments, while a few wear short tunics, perhaps because they were not considered professional physicians. Of the authors represented, nine are Greek: Dioscorides, Galen (initial A), Democritus (B), Moschion (D), Oribasius (F), Alexander of Tralles (G), Paul of Aegina (H), Palladius and Gerodius (N); nine are Latin: Antyllus (E), Butanicus (T), Cornelius Celsus (X), Macer Floridus (Y), Pliny the Elder (Z), Isidore of Seville, Cassius Felix and Theodore Priscian (present on other folios, among the herbs); and ten are Arabic: Abrahamn (C), Avicenna (I), Albucasis (K), Serapion (L), Açaraviusnote 23 (M), Avenzoar (O), Jean Mésué (P), Isaac Israeli (R), Haly Abbas (S) and Rhazès (V).\nThe illuminators of ms. 459 of the Casanatense may have been inspired by this series to decorate the initial of the first chapter of each alphabetical section with the bust of an anonymous magister. Some are women, others wear the symbolic turban of Arab physicians, and many have their hands raised in typical teacher gestures. They form a genealogy of illustrious physicians reminiscent of the series of portraits of ancestors typical of several other contemporary Visconti manuscripts. The theme can also be seen in the Livre des simples médecines, some of whose manuscripts feature a bordered incipit featuring several doctors. They are depicted in full activity: reading, teaching, examining a patient, inspecting a urinal or heating a still. The figure of Galen is also often present, to suggest the theoretical and historical basis of the medical arts.\n\n\n== Functions and reading ==\nThe Tractatus de herbis is the result of a late thirteenth-century scholar's compilation of the pharmacological and botanical knowledge of the time. While such collections of texts were common complements to therapeutic theory and practice, the treatise's unknown author departed from several centuries of medieval tradition by including over 400 images in his communication strategy. This choice proved a winning one, as the numerous manuscripts that followed it prove, and readers in the 16th century were still consulting in printed form a treatise that had retained the essential structure and content of its ancestor. The exact function of the Tractatus remains unknown, however, and is likely to have varied over its more than 200 years of use.\n\n\n=== Field guide ===\nThe most striking feature of the early versions of the treatise is the presence of several hundred images whose naturalism has attracted the attention of art historians. The plant illustrations are remarkably descriptive, and in this respect stand out significantly from the imagery used at the time. Drawing on the work of science historian Charles Singer, Otto Pächt considers medieval herbariums to be field guides, asserting that \"the illustration of these manuals would be useless to the herbalist (and physician) if the plants were not depicted with such veracity that they could be easily identified\". From this perspective, most earlier works would have failed to achieve this standard by tirelessly copying the same useless images, and the success of the Secreta Salernitana would be due to the high informational value of their observation of nature.\nAlthough intuitively obvious, the idea that medieval images were primarily used to identify plants in the wild is contradicted by further analysis. First of all, it's hard to imagine that a volume as costly and cumbersome as ms. Egerton 747 could have been taken into the field. It should also be noted that the vast majority of medieval herbariums did not include any images, and that at the time the Tractatus was produced, scholars likely to use it received their plant material in prepared form, as is the case today. Medicinal plant gatherers are identified in contemporary texts as rustici, a social group that the English scholar Roger Bacon describes as illiterate, and who were certainly not the target audience for such treatises. The true function of illustrated herbariums therefore remains a much more open question than Pächt's or Singer's statements might suggest.\n\n\n=== Ordinatio and Compilatio ===\n\nThe Tractatus de herbis was conceived during a period of transition in Western scholarship that saw the establishment, between the 11th and 14th centuries, of new scholarly thinking practices and a shift from meditative monastic reading to analytical scholastic reading. According to a thesis by British paleographer Malcolm Parkes, this change was partly due to the development in the books of the concepts of Ordinatio (\"order, arrangement\") and Compilatio (\"compilation\"). The former refers to the functional characteristics and organization of a work written for ease of reference, while the latter describes the concern to study an argument from beginning to end by providing the auctores in toto, the author's original and complete corpus. Readers who previously depended on glosses could now form an informed opinion thanks to a new textual structure, which would have fostered the development of the analytical and systematic reading to which modern scholars are accustomed.\nThe Tractatus de herbis in ms. Egerton 747 is a practical analogue of Parkes' thesis. Its form has been designed to help the reader find certain types of information easily (Ordinatio): a table of contents opens almost every alphabetical section, and within each table, each item is highlighted by a pied-de-mouche (the C of capitulum, \"chapter\") alternately in red or blue. In the body of the text, entries are indicated by an image and the name of the substance. The latter is introduced by a littera notabilior, an enlarged letter designed to mark the beginning of a textual unit, which is colored alternately red or blue. Each substance is itself associated with a series of remedies, and the quotation evoking each treatment is in turn marked by a red or blue pied-de-mouche. A reader familiar with the Latin name of a substance could thus easily locate it in the treatise thanks to the alphabetical summaries, and then just as easily find each of its therapeutic uses.\nIn terms of content, the manuscript adheres strictly to the Compilatio principle, presenting summarized versions of authoritative texts reorganized and supplemented to provide a complete picture of available knowledge. The result is often compared with the Liber de virtutibus herbarum, a slightly later treatise based on the same sources and compiled comparably. It is the work of a certain Rufinus, who presents himself as a scholar who had applied himself to the seven arts in Naples and Bologna, and who, after learning astronomy, went on to study the science of plants. It is possible that the anonymous author of the Tractatus was a medical man with a similar scholarly background.\n\n\n=== Copies for bibliophiles ===\nManfred de Monte Imperiale's version of the Tractatus shares the same erudition as Egerton's 747 and is, in a way, the culmination of his compilation process. But from the second half of the 14th century, the function of the Tractatus evolved in another direction. In Northern Italy, the Masson 116 ms. was never completed, and lost its scientific value by presenting only images. Its descendants, the mss. Casanatense 459 and Sloane 4016, are sumptuous works illustrated by leading artists, intended above all for a wealthy elite.\n\nIn 15th-century France, princes such as Charles d'Anjou, Louis de Bruges, Isabelle de Portugal, Charles d'Orléans and even King Louis XII had a Livre des simples médecines made or owned. While the passage in the vernacular might a priori have made the treatise more accessible, a closer examination of the text shows quite the opposite. The preservation of the order of the lists according to the initial of their name in Latin requires knowledge of both the Latin terminology and the French translation in order to locate a substance in the work. Generally speaking, the layout of translated versions features a smaller number of visual cues. The system of \"pieds-de-mouches\" to indicate the various therapeutic indications is often omitted, and the lists of synonyms that open each entry are truncated. The French version does, however, include several new features: an alphabetical glossary to help explain the more learned terms, often translated literally from Latin, and an index of effective remedies for various ailments, starting with headaches and ending with more general disorders such as fever or poisons. Most of the plant illustrations are copied from ms. Egerton 747, but the physical details, notably the shape of leaves and flowers, are often simplified and sometimes misinterpreted. Human figures, on the other hand, are far more numerous and depicted in carefully executed, brightly coloured scenes. Certain substances known specifically to treat royal patients, such as musk, deer heart bone or lynx stone, are specifically enhanced with gold leaf in several manuscripts. As with earlier versions of the treatise, it is difficult to determine the function of the images and to judge whether they served to inform, aid mnemonics, visually signal entries or simply assert some degree of textual authority. But without saying that the Livre des simples médecines were not consulted for their medical content, it seems clear that the original scientific purpose of the treatise gradually gave way to the interests of bibliophiles.\n\tExample of the evolution of illustrations: the \"De appio emorroidarum\" chapter\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The end of a tradition ===\n\nThe Livre des simples médecines cycle comes to an end with two manuscripts whose layout and iconography mark the end of the tradition and herald a new approach to the subject. These are the ms. fr. F. v. VI, 1 from the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, illuminated by Robinet Testard for Charles d'Angoulême and Louise de Savoie between 1489 and 1495, and its replica from the first quarter of the 16th century, French ms. 12322 from the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Their first singularity is that the illustrations that previously accompanied each chapter have been extracted to form a separate \"album\". The text itself, rather than following alphabetical order, is divided into five successive sections by category of substance: \"herbs\", \"trees, fruits and resins\", \"metals and minerals\", \"animal matter\" and \"other substances\". The arrangement of the images, however, is only very partially in keeping with this plan, and the album that follows the text is divided into just two parts: the first is devoted to grasses, and the second to trees and shrubs. In each of these sections are interspersed folios that break the apparent rule. One contains several frames with figurative scenes (metal and mineral extraction, aloe wood fishing) and the whale from which ambergris is extracted. Two others are compositions in the form of landscapes combining several singles. Finally, the rest of the non-vegetable substances are collected on a single folio in the form of a double-sided cupboard, the shelves of which are loaded with labeled samples.\n\nOverall, the album only partially covers the content of the text, illustrating only 324 of the 486 chapters of the Livre des simples médecines. This discrepancy is difficult to explain, but could mean that the St. Petersburg manuscript was never actually completed, perhaps following the untimely death of its recipient, Charles d'Angoulême. While half of the plant figures reproduce the schematic mode of the tradition, the others are of a realistic type, in complete break with the illustrative cycle of the Tractatus de herbis, and for the most part painted after nature for the original manuscript. Thirteen plants are also represented in duplicate, in both styles, and some sixty are not mentioned anywhere in the text.\nAlthough they are not the first versions to have reinterpreted or modified the treatise's original layout, the St. Petersburg manuscript and its Parisian copy represent a clear enough break that is not accidental. The need to reorganize the simplicities according to different, more \"modern\" criteria, and the apparent weariness with two-dimensional plant representations, clearly show that the two-hundred-year-old tradition was already no longer deemed satisfactory. Change seemed obvious and inevitable, and the Tractatus was soon to be replaced by precise botanical illustrations and printed herbariums. The Grant Herbier en françoys and its translation Grete Herball, the last representatives of the tradition, would in turn disappear in the second half of the sixteenth century, following the introduction into European pharmacopoeias of products from the New World and Paracelsian medical principles.\n\n\n=== Manuscript list ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of florilegia and botanical codices\nMedieval medicine of Western Europe\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCamus, Jules (1886).

He completed a bachelor's degree in Agricultural system management from University of Missouri in 2013.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nDiehl raises corn and soybeans on his family farm, as well as a cow–calf operation and feedlot.\nDiehl is the District 4 Director of the Missouri Soybean Association, and is also a member of Missouri Corn, the Missouri Cattlemen's Association, Missouri Farm Bureau, the Nevada Elks Lodge, and the Butler Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n=== Missouri House of Representatives ===\nDiehl represents district 125, comprising Bates, Vernon, and Cedar counties.\nIn 2024, Diehl worked with Bayer to introduce legislation in the Missouri House that would protect pesticide companies from legal liability from claims that products such as Roundup cause cancer. Diehl argued that costs associated with lawsuits could cause Bayer to pull products from the US market. Similar bills were introduced in Iowa and Idaho, with legal experts warning of broader impacts. Bayer increased lobbyists in Missouri over the previous year and also leads an advertising campaign with Modern Ag Alliance claiming that litigation costs threaten the availability of glyphosate. The bill received opposition from fellow Republicans, as well as a Democrat Representative who recently battled cancer.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n=== State representatives ===\n\n\n== References ==",

It aimed to bring an end to the First Ivorian Civil War, and was followed up by four complementary accords.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe Ivorian government and FNCI, along with other armed groups, had been in talks mediated by Burkinabe president Compaore in the Burkinabe capital of Ouagadougou since February 5 over ending the five-year long war. The talks culminated in the Ouagadougou Agreements on March 4.\n\n\n== Accords ==\nThe first measure of the accords was the dismantling of a neutral zone separating northern Ivory Coast, controlled by the Forces Nouvelles (FNCI), and the government-held south led by Gbagbo. Areas in the former neutral zone were jointly manned by government forces and FNCI soldiers. The ceasefire and the dismantling of the zone largely by 2008. On March 29, 2007, FNCI commander Soro was appointed Prime Minister of the country under Gbagbo as part of a transitional government. In the new government consisting of thirty-three government ministers, FNCI had seven, PDCI-RDA had five, Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (PFI) had nine, Union for Democracy and Peace in Ivory Coast (UPDCI) had two, Rally of Republicans had five, the Democratic and Citizen's Union, Ivorian Labor Party, and Movement of the Forces for the Future had one each.\nThe agreement led to the end of the war, and the 2010 Ivorian presidential election that was initially scheduled in 2008.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLinas-Marcoussis Agreement\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 BetRivers 200 was the 10th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 43rd iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, April 27, 2024, at Dover Motor Speedway in Dover, Delaware, a 1 mile (1.6 km) permanent asphalt oval shaped speedway. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 200 laps, but was increased to 208 laps due to numerous NASCAR overtime attempts. In a wild race with carnage in the final stages, Ryan Truex, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would steal the win after taking the lead from Carson Kvapil on the final restart, and won the race after the caution came out on the final lap. This was Truex's second career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, his first of the season, and his second consecutive win at Dover. Cole Custer had dominated the majority of the race, winning the second stage and leading a race-high 95 laps. He pitted following a brief red flag for rain, and navigated through the field to finish 5th. To fill out the podium, Kvapil and Sam Mayer, both driving for JR Motorsports, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\nThis was also the fourth and final race of the Dash 4 Cash. Drivers who were eligible for the Dash 4 Cash were Jesse Love, Riley Herbst, and Anthony Alfredo, since they were the highest finishing Xfinity Series regulars following the race at Talladega. Ryan Sieg was also eligible, due to winning the latest D4C race. Alfredo would claim the $100K bonus cash after finishing 9th, seven positions ahead of his closest competitor, Riley Herbst.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nDover Motor Speedway is an oval race track in Dover, Delaware, United States that has held at least two NASCAR races since it opened in 1969. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the NTT IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete oval, with 24° banking in the turns and 9° banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Speedway Motorsports.\nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nThe first and only practice session was held on Friday, April 26, at 3:00 PM EST, and would last for 20 minutes. Brandon Jones, driving for JR Motorsports, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 23.345, and a speed of 154.209 mph (248.175 km/h).\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\nQualifying was held on Friday, April 26, at 3:30 PM EST. Since Dover Motor Speedway is a short track, the qualifying system used is a single-car, two-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have two laps to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nBrandon Jones, driving for JR Motorsports, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 22.950, and a speed of 156.863 mph (252.447 km/h).\nChad Finchum was the only driver who failed to qualify.\n\n\n=== Qualifying results ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\nStage 1 Laps: 45\n\nStage 2 Laps: 45\n\nStage 3 Laps: 118\n\n\n== Standings after the race ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Exile of Rama was an event that appeared in Ramayana, and was the most important period in the life of Rama. Rama was exiled by his father, Dasharatha and step mother Kaikeyi along with his wife Sita and Lakshmana for 14 years. Rama's exile leads to the further events of Ramayana, such as abduction of his wife Sita, his meeting with Hanuman and Sugriva, his battle with Ravana and ultimately, killing of Ravana, for which Vishnu incarnated himself as Rama. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Early life of Rama ===\n\nKing Dasharatha was the king of Kosala Kingdom from Ikshvaku or Solar Dynasty. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. Dasharatha was ashamed of being childless, despite being reached in his middle years, and thus, he performed a Putrakameshti Yajna on the advice of his ministers by Rishyasringa. From the sacrificial fire, Agni himself blessed Dasharatha with four sons, and thus, Dasharatha's three wives bear four sons, Rama from Kaushalya, Bharata from Kaikeyi and twins Lakshmana and Shatrughana from Sumitra. Rama was actually the seventh avatar of Vishnu, who incarnated himself as human, to kill cruel demon king Ravana. Rama spend a happy childhood with his brothers and parents, and took education from Guru Vasishtha in his Gurukula. After completing his education, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana accompanied Vishwamitra, to kill demons and protect sages and their Yajnas. There, Rama killed several demons, including Maricha, Subahu and Tataka and even freed Ahalya, wife of Rishi Gautama from a curse, and thus proved his divinity. After that, both brothers accompanied Vishwamitra to the Mithila in the Svayamvara of Mithila's princess Sita, daughter of King Janaka. He broke the bow of Shiva, as the condition of Svayamvara and married Sita. Rama's other three brothers also married to Sita's sister. Lakshmana to Urmila, younger daughter of Janaka and Bharata and Shatrughana to Mandavi and Shrutakirti respectively, daughters of Janaka's brother, Kushadhvaja. All four couples married and led a peaceful life in Ayodhya, for some time.\n\n\n=== Envy of Manthara ===\n\nAfter several years, Dasharatha decides to coronate Rama as crowned prince of Ayodhya. Rama's coronation was organized and led to the celebration in Ayodhya. Manthara was a trusted maid and confidante of Queen Kaikeyi, known for her sharp wit and cunning nature. However, her loyalty to Kaikeyi was overshadowed by her envy towards Rama, the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Kaikeyi's stepson.\nUpon learning of King Dasharatha's intention to crown Rama as his successor, Manthara saw her position threatened. She seized upon Kaikeyi's love for her own son, Bharata, and planted seeds of doubt and fear in Kaikeyi's mind regarding Rama's ascendancy to the throne. Manipulating Kaikeyi's emotions and exploiting her insecurities, Manthara cunningly convinced her that Rama's coronation would endanger Bharata's future and her own status in the palace.\nDriven by Manthara's relentless persuasion, Kaikeyi demanded the fulfillment of two boons granted to her by King Dasharatha years earlier. Exploiting these boons, Kaikeyi coerced Dasharatha into banishing Rama to the forest for fourteen years and crowning Bharata as the king instead.\n\n\n=== Companionship and exile ===\n\nTo fulfill his father King Dasharatha's promise to Kaikeyi, Rama willingly accepts exile, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to upholding dharma (righteousness) and honoring his father's word. Despite being the rightful heir to the throne of Ayodhya, Rama selflessly agrees to go into exile for fourteen years to honor his father's promise to Kaikeyi. His decision exemplifies his dedication to duty and sacrifice. Sita, Rama's beloved wife, and Lakshmana, his loyal brother, accompany him into exile, demonstrating their unwavering support and commitment to Rama. Sita's steadfast devotion and Lakshmana's selfless service complement Rama's resolve and form a poignant tableau of familial loyalty. Amidst scenes of sorrow and lamentation, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana bid farewell to their loved ones and depart for the forest. The citizens of Ayodhya, grief-stricken at the departure of their beloved prince, express their sorrow as they watch the exiles leave the kingdom. The departure of Rama for the forest symbolizes the transient nature of worldly attachments and the importance of fulfilling one's duties and obligations, even at great personal cost. The episode underscores the central theme of dharma and the moral complexities inherent in familial relationships and political intrigue. The departure of Rama for the forest with his wife and brother remains one of the most iconic and poignant moments in Indian mythology. It serves as a timeless reminder of the power of duty, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion to principles of righteousness. The episode continues to inspire artists, writers, and devotees, resonating across cultures and generations with its timeless message of courage, loyalty, and spiritual fortitude.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== First day ===\nRama, along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, left Ayodhya during the night to honor his father King Dasharatha's word, despite protests and pleas from the citizens who were deeply attached to him. He didn't want to cause them emotional distress, so he chose to leave while they were asleep.\nDuring their journey, Rama encountered several individuals who would later play crucial roles in the narrative. Nishadraj Guha, a tribal leader and a devotee of Rama, provided shelter to them on the banks of the river Ganga on the first night of their exile. Kevat, the boatman, helped them cross the river and showed his devotion by washing their feet. Both Nishadraj Guha and Kevat, were symbolised the epitome of devotion and purity.\nAfter crossing the river Ganga, Arya Sumant, the minister, who was sent by Dasharatha to bring Rama back to Ayodhya returned to Ayodhya adhering to the orders of Rama. Despite being unhappy with Rama's decision to stay in exile keeping his father's words, Sumant was forced to return Ayodhya without Rama, Sita and Lakshmana.\n\n\n=== Chitrakoot and initial days ===\nAfter Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana depart from Ayodhya following Rama's exile decree, their journey brings them to Chitrakoot, a serene and picturesque region nestled along the banks of the Mandakini River. This marks the beginning of their temporary abode during the exile period.\nUpon arriving in Chitrakoot, Rama seeks out the renowned sage Bharadwaja, known for his wisdom and spiritual prowess. Sage Bharadwaja's ashram in Chitrakoot serves as a sanctuary for Rama, providing him with spiritual guidance and solace during this challenging time.\nSage Bharadwaja warmly welcomes Rama, recognizing his divine lineage and righteous character. He offers his blessings and imparts valuable guidance to Rama, advising him on the path of dharma (righteousness) and the duties of a prince even in exile.\nDuring their stay in Chitrakoot, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana immerse themselves in the teachings of Bharadwaja. They engage in spiritual practices, meditation, and discussions on philosophy and morality, enriching their understanding of life's deeper truths.\nBharadwaja serves as a trusted counselor and mentor to Rama, offering counsel on various matters and providing emotional support during moments of doubt or adversity. His wisdom and guidance strengthen Rama's resolve to fulfill his responsibilities despite the challenges of exile.Chitrakoot's natural beauty and tranquil environment provide Rama and his companions with a serene backdrop for contemplation and introspection. The lush forests, flowing rivers, and gentle hills of Chitrakoot nurture their spirits and deepen their connection with nature.\nAs Rama resides in Chitrakoot under the benevolent guidance of Sage Bharadwaja, the ashram becomes a haven of spiritual growth and inner peace.\nThe teachings and experiences gathered during this period lay the foundation for Rama's steadfast adherence to dharma and his unwavering devotion to righteousness.\n\n\n=== Death of Dasharatha ===\n\nAfter Sumantra returned with the news of Rama's exile, Dasharatha was overcome with grief and guilt. His heart, already burdened by the separation from Rama, couldn't bear the additional shock. He fell seriously ill, his health rapidly deteriorating as he struggled to come to terms with the events unfolding in his kingdom.\nDespite the best efforts of the palace physicians, Dasharatha's condition worsened day by day. He suffered from intense emotional distress, leading to physical complications that ultimately proved fatal. Surrounded by his loved ones and advisors, Dasharatha breathed his last breath, leaving Ayodhya in mourning for their beloved king.\nAfter the death of Dasharatha, Bharata along with Shatrughana, who was at the Kekeya kingdom summoned by Sage Vashishta.\nAfter the death of King Dasharatha, Bharata's return to Ayodhya is marked by a mix of emotions and challenges. As he arrives, the atmosphere in Ayodhya is heavy with grief and uncertainty. The sudden demise of the beloved king, coupled with the circumstances surrounding his death, leads to suspicion and distrust among some of the people towards Bharata.\nOne of the primary reasons for this suspicion is the role played by Kaikeyi, Bharata's mother, in Rama's exile and Dasharatha's subsequent death. Kaikeyi's actions, driven by her desire to see Bharata crowned as king, are widely criticized and seen as a betrayal of Rama, who was dearly loved by the people of Ayodhya. This leads to doubts about Bharata's loyalty and intentions, despite his innocence in the matter.\nHowever, Bharata remains steadfast in his devotion to Rama and his commitment to the well-being of Ayodhya. Upon his return, he takes on the responsibility of performing the last rites of his father Dasharatha with utmost reverence and respect, showcasing his adherence to tradition and duty as a prince.\nDespite the challenges and criticisms he faces, Bharata's love and reverence for Rama shine through. He prepared to go to Chitrakoot, where Rama was staying in his exile, to tell him the news of his father's demise and bring him back to ascend the throne Ayodhya. Bharata's return to Ayodhya after Dasharatha's death is a complex narrative of familial loyalty, duty, and the struggle to uphold righteousness amidst challenging circumstances.\nBharata, along with his three mothers, ministers, citizens and priests moved to Chitrakoot in order to bring Rama back to Ayodhya. He met with Guha, on the way, who directed him the way to Chitrakoot.\n\n\n=== Bharata and Rama's meet or Bharatmilaap ===\n\nWith company of Guha and other people, Bharata reached to Chitrakoot to Rama, and was first misunderstood by Lakshmana. The event of Rama and Bharata's meeting is generally called as Bharatmilaap (Sanskrit: भरतमिलाप; lit. The meeting with/of Bharata).\nBharata meets Rama in the forest where Rama, along with his wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshmana, has been living a life of asceticism. Bharata, dressed in simple attire and carrying Rama's wooden sandals, approaches Rama with reverence and humility. He expresses his deep sorrow at the turn of events and his earnest desire to see Rama return to Ayodhya as the rightful king.\nRama, touched by Bharata's devotion and unwavering loyalty, embraces his brother warmly.

He was once the prosperous king of the vanaras, ruling from the Kishkindha kingdom. However, his brother Bali, known for his strength and valor, grew suspicious of Sugriva's intentions, particularly regarding Bali's wife Tara. In a series of misunderstandings and power struggles, Bali banished Sugriva and seized control of the kingdom. Sugriva, unjustly accused and exiled, sought refuge in the Rishyamukha mountain, where he met Hanuman and formed a loyal friendship. The conflict between Sugriva and Bali intensified due to Bali's oppressive rule and mistreatment of Sugriva's allies, including Hanuman and Angada.

Rama, armed with his divine weapons and supported by Sugriva and the vanara army, confronts Bali in a duel.

Having accomplished his tasks, Hanuman returned to Rama with news of Sita's whereabouts and the situation in Lanka. His return was met with joy and gratitude by Rama and his allies. Hanuman's devotion, bravery, and intelligence played a crucial role in the eventual rescue of Sita and the defeat of Ravana.\n\n\n== War of Lanka ==\n\n\n=== Preparations ===\nAfter Hanuman's return, Rama, with Lakshmana, Sugriva, Jambvant, Angad and other Vanara sena, marched to the Indian Ocean, (present- day that part is known as Palk Strait). Rama's journey to Lanka required a passage over the vast sea. Rama requested sea to give them a way to cross sea, however, sea filled with pride, ignores Rama.

Their collective effort and determination showcased the power of unity and teamwork in overcoming obstacles. The construction of the bridge also attracted divine attention and support. Various celestial beings, including gods and sages, blessed the endeavor, ensuring its success.

After Sita's rescue Sita was ordered by Rama, to pass through fire, to receive original Sita, and termed it as Agniparikhsa. However, people there thought that, Agniparikhsa was done to check the purity of Sita.\n\n\n== Return to Ayodhya ==\n\nAfter killing Ravana, Rama finally prepares to return Ayodhya, as 14 years were about to complete.After the victorious battle against Ravana and the rescue of Sita, Rama's return to Ayodhya is marked by grandeur and celebration.

Citizens can approach him with their grievances, and he listens to them with empathy, addressing their concerns promptly and fairly. Rama's governance is marked by ethical conduct and transparency. He leads by example, upholding moral values and integrity in all his dealings, setting a high standard for his administration.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nRama's later life is described in the Uttar Kand of original Valmiki's Ramayan. However, many scholars believes that it is not a part of original epic, but a later interpretation in it. This section of epic goes in detail, about the suspicion of Rama on his wife Sita, and sent her into exile, despite being pure, and birth of his twin sons, Lava and Kusha.  \nAfter Rama becomes the ruler, Sita became pregnant with twins. However, citizens of Ayodhya are suspicious about the purity of Sita, as she was kidnapped by Ravana, tough untouched.  \nRama, heard the rumours spread among the citizens, and exiles Sita. There, she seeks shelter in the Ashram of Valmiki and gave birth to twin sons of Rama: Lava and Kusha. Both were trained by Valmiki in various subjects, and were brave, like Rama. Valmiki also taught them Ramayana, which he composed on the orders of Narada and Brahma. When Rama does Asvamedha Yajna in order to expand his kingdom, his horse was captured by Lava and Kusha, and it was then, they both recite Ramayana in the court of Rama and Rama got to know about their real identity, that Lava and Kusha are his sons. However, Rama asked Sita to again give an Agnipareeksha or fire test, to prove her purity. Disheartened Sita, returned to her actual mother, Dharti Maa or Goddess Earth forever leaving Rama and Ayodhya behind.  \nMany versions, such as, Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas, doesn't include about the exile of Sita. Tough, many scholars believes that Tulsidas didn't want to end Rama's story in a tragic way.        \nAccording to Valmiki Ramayana, Rama ruled for 11000 years, and after completing all his duties accordingly, he along with his companions left his human body and moved to his heavenly abode.        \n\n\n== Timeline ==\nIn terms of historical dating, the Ramayana doesn't provide specific dates in the Gregorian calendar. Instead, it is traditionally placed in the Treta Yuga, an era within Hindu cosmology. However, scholars and researchers have attempted to correlate events from the Ramayana with historical timelines and astronomical observations.\nOne such attempt is the work of Dr. V. V. Raman, a physicist and Indologist, who proposed a dating for Rama's exile based on astronomical references in the epic. He suggested that Rama's birth occurred around 5114 BCE and his exile around 5077 BCE. This dating is based on astronomical configurations described in the Ramayana, such as the positions of planets and stars, which have been correlated with astronomical software to determine possible dates.\nAnother approach involves analyzing archaeological evidence and cultural contexts. Some scholars suggest that events from the Ramayana might have taken place during the early part of the first millennium BCE, based on archaeological findings and cultural developments in ancient India.\nIt's essential to note that these datings are subject to debate and interpretation, and there isn't a consensus among scholars. The Ramayana is primarily a religious and mythological text deeply embedded in Hindu tradition, and attempts to historically date its events should be approached with caution.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nRama's exile holds a profound legacy within Hindu tradition and beyond. It serves as a narrative of moral and ethical lessons, exemplifying virtues such as duty, sacrifice, and devotion. Rama's adherence to dharma, or righteousness, even in the face of adversity, provides a timeless example for devotees. Additionally, Rama is revered as the epitome of an ideal king, symbolizing just and compassionate governance. The bond between Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshmana is celebrated as a model of unwavering love and familial duty. The Ramayana, which chronicles Rama's exile, is one of the most revered epics in Hinduism and has influenced literature, art, and culture across South and Southeast Asia. Festivals such as Diwali and Vijayadashmi commemorate aspects of the Ramayana narrative, while philosophical insights explored in the epic delve into concepts such as karma, dharma, and the pursuit of spiritual liberation. Overall, Rama's exile continues to inspire individuals and societies with its timeless teachings on morality, devotion, and righteousness.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nVarious artistic depictions of Rama's exile is a  significant part of Indian art and culture:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRama\nRamayana\nVersions of Ramayana\nList of characters in Ramayana\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Missoula Children's Theater (MCT) is a nationally recognized touring children's theater program that travels across the United States and casts local youths in performances of original plays based on classic children's stories. Based in Missoula, Montana, it is part of MCT, Inc., a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization that employs about 120 full-time staff members and also includes the Missoula Community Theater.  The Missoula Children's Theatre is believed to be the world's largest touring children's theatre.\nThe mission statement of MCT is “the development of life skills in children through participation in the performing arts.” The organization has traveled to 50 states, 5 Canadian Provinces and 17 countries. One goal of MCT is to “reach the small communities that have few creative outlets or resources for their children,” and to “[help] our country’s children grow into confident, successful citizens using the positive results of our programs.” Traveling to over 1000 communities annually, MCT works with roughly 65,000 children a year who perform in plays, and their theater workshops reach 150,000 young people in underserved areas.\n\n\n== History ==\nMCT was founded by Jim Caron and Don Collins in 1970. They began by putting on performances for children, then started casting actual children when appropriate for certain plays. The decision to use child actors who lived in the communities where they performed began in 1972, when Caron and Collins scheduled a performance of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in Miles City, Montana, in February. Not wanting to travel with their child cast members over 500 miles of icy roads, they decided to cast local children instead. They arrived a week early to prepare and, thinking they would have difficulty finding enough young performers, were stunned to be greeted by over 450 children wanting to audition for the seven spots.\n\nCaron continued to serve as CEO of MCT until 2010 when he was succeeded by Michael McGill. For his work with MCT, Caron was awarded the Montana Governor's Arts Award in 1987, and received an Outstanding Alumnus Award from the University of Montana in 1993. Originally, the CEO also needed to serve as the artistic director, but by 2018, they had obtained grant funding from the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, which allowed them to hire a separate full time artistic director, allowing the CEO to focus on leadership and development.\nMissoula Children's Theater has contracted with the United States Department of Defense Dependents Schools and other service programs of  the Army, Navy, and Air Force to bring programs to the children of families at domestic and overseas military bases for over 20 years. For example, the staff of MCT was hired by the U.S. Army's Installation Management Command to support Child, Youth and School Service in 2012 and toured multiple U.S. military bases throughout Europe.\nIn 2015, MCT launched an Intergenerational Tour Program that added stops at retirement communities where school-age children and senior citizens work with one another. Each resident is paired with a child from the community and they prepare for their roles together.\nIn 2020, MCT was awarded grant funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, one of seventeen regional and community musical theatre organizations so recognized. As the organization had needed to suspend many of its activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the funding was particularly timely and helpful as MCT staff restarted their traditional programs.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nMissoula Children's Theater's touring program is unique in its approach to casting local children. Communities have to ask for MCT to come and do a residency. There are approximately 40-50 traveling teams that each consist of two adult actor-directors. MCT staff usually travel to communities in distinctive red pickup trucks that carry the scripts, costumes, props, and other items required to put on a play. While there is a small or no charge to the local children who participate, communities support the program by providing lodging for the MCT staff, performance and rehearsal space, a piano and accompanist, publicity, and a residency fee (which varies by region). Generally, 50 to 60 children are cast and they have 20 hours of rehearsal. MCT presentations are original musical adaptations of classic children's stories, usually with a humorous twist.  Local children audition for roles, and then rehearse for six days prior to putting on two performances. The MCT team also conducts enrichment workshops that serve additional children.\nOne special focus of MCT has always been to reach rural areas. In casting young performers, they look beyond children with dramatic talent and seek out children who would benefit from the process. Another area of emphasis is to work with military bases and the children of people serving in the armed forces.  MCT also holds musical theatre day camps and performing arts classes in Missoula, as well as a summer Performing Arts Camp that admits students from around the world.  Their program “Next Step Prep—The Academy for Musical Theatre” is for high school students and helps them prepare for college or a career in the performing arts.\nGroups that have helped sponsor the MCT in local communities have included local colleges and universities, local United Way groups, and arts councils, and local community theater organizations.\nA documentary, The Little Red Truck, followed a MCT team and their young actors as they prepared a show. Co-produced by director Rob Whitehair and his wife, Pam Voth, it was released in 2008 to mixed reviews, but was favorably described by The New York Times as “the cutest thing in the history of cuteness.” Whitehair stated, “This film restored my faith in humanity. It forced me to look at things in a different light and ask myself, ‘At what point do we lose the ability to say anything is possible.’ These kids still believe.” \n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\nLily Gladstone was cast in a Missoula Children's Theatre production of Cinderella when the program visited her childhood hometown of  East Glacier, Montana. As an adult, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 2024 for her role in  Killers of the Flower Moon, the first Native American woman to do so. She also was the first Indigenous actor to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Female Actor, as well as the first Native American woman to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She explained, “I just remember how much it meant to me when MCT would come through…It's like I know in every single one of those classes there's a little me.” \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Charter of Paris against Cancer is an international convention that commits signatory countries and individuals to better combat cancer, notably through support for medical research, the implementation of screening policies, and the development of support measures for patients.\nPresident Jacques Chirac, representing France, was the first signatory of the Charter on February 4, 2000. It is in memory of this event that February 4th was chosen to become World Cancer Day.\nSince its first ratification, the Charter continues to be promoted by the AVEC Foundation established by oncologist David Khayat, who was among the personalities behind the text. Each year, the Foundation organizes an annual gala at the Palace of Versailles, during which the \"Charter of Paris against cancer Awards\" are presented to recognize individuals committed to the fight against cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999, Professor David Khayat decided with several colleagues to draw attention from governments and public opinion to the fight against cancer. During a meeting in Paris among specialists on the subject, including David Khayat and doctors Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, Peter Harper, James F. Holland, Lawrence H. Einhorn, and Martine Piccart, the idea emerged to create the \"Charter of Paris against cancer,\" an international political document that would establish the general principles for global action against this disease, considered by WHO as a major cause of death worldwide.\nOn February 4, 2000, during the first World Summit against cancer organized in Paris, the Charter was signed at the Élysée Palace by French President  Chirac, UNESCO Director-General Kōichirō Matsuura, and over a hundred doctors, oncologists, and biologists from around the world. The text of the Charter was subsequently intended to be signed by politicians and doctors from around the world, but also by patients and their families.\nThe ratification of this text by the French government led to the simultaneous adoption of a \"National Cancer Control Program\" in the country, aimed at strengthening prevention, screening, the quality of care, and patients' rights. This plan foreshadowed the first Cancer Plan, announced on March 23, 2003, by President Jacques Chirac, and implemented between 2003 and 2007 with the objective of raising public awareness about cancer and taking effective measures to defeat it. This program also gave rise to the French National Cancer Institute in 2005.\nWith the support of oncologists from around the world and significant patient associations, the Charter of Paris against cancer has been translated into many languages to facilitate its global reach. It is now promoted by the AVEC Foundation, chaired by Khayat.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe Charter consists of ten articles. These define principles and actions to be implemented to improve access to and the quality of care for patients in order to increase their chances of survival.\n\nArticle 1 upholds the dignity of patients by stating that \"Every person with cancer has the same rights as any human being.\" This is a principle of non-discrimination aimed at preserving the patient's place in society.\nArticle 2 emphasizes the need to change the way individuals view cancer and cancer patients and \"redefine this disease as a potentially curable biological condition and not a social condition.\"\nArticle 3 requires signatories to support medical research against cancer. \"The parties commit to making every effort to improve government and industrial funding for fundamental research (...) and to improve conditions that allow scientists to work freely.\" The article also emphasizes the importance of clinical research to \"enable the realization of rapid and effective clinical trials.\"\nArticle 4 urges parties to focus on the quality of care provided to patients to reduce statistical disparities observed in survival rates.\nArticle 5 promotes cancer prevention and the implementation of awareness campaigns to curb the rapid progression of the disease forecasted by the World Health Organization. The article particularly highlights the importance of \"public education on tobacco consumption.\"\nArticle 6 advocates for the development of screening so that all individuals can benefit from it \"regardless of their race, nationality, or socio-economic conditions.\"\nArticle 7 aims to improve patient care and make them \"an active partner in the fight against cancer\" by strengthening their ties with healthcare professionals.\nArticle 8, starting from the premise that \"survival probabilities can be affected by the mental and physical state of the patient,\" requires the commitment of signatories to improve the quality of life of patients \"at all stages of the disease,\" including \"when cancer is not curable.\"\nArticle 9 pushes for national planning in the fight against cancer to establish a relevant strategy \"based on resources and local needs.\"\nArticle 10 encourages the establishment of global alliances and networks, alongside the national effort required in Article 9, to more effectively achieve all the objectives set by the Charter. It also proclaims that February 4th will be considered World Cancer Day.\n\n\n== Signatories ==\nDuring its initial ratification on February 4, 2000, the Charter was signed by 156 individuals, a majority of whom were doctors and oncologists, often directors of specialized medical institutes in oncology. On the diplomatic front, in addition to Jacques Chirac and Kōichirō Matsuura, signatories included Elie Wiesel and Princess Chulabhorn of Thailand. In total, the signatories hailed from about thirty different countries. A few months later, in July 2000, the Charter was also signed by cyclist Lance Armstrong, himself a cancer survivor, at the conclusion of the 2000 Tour de France.\nSeveral countries subsequently joined the Charter in the following years, including Tunisia in 2006, Ukraine in 2007, Uzbekistan in 2010, and Kazakhstan in 2011.\n\n\n== Charter of Paris against cancer Awards ==\nThe AVEC Foundation, responsible for promoting the Charter, organizes an annual charity gala held at the Palace of Versailles, with the venue graciously provided by the French State. These events bring together several hundred guests, including celebrities from the worlds of music, cinema, politics, and business. On this occasion, the foundation presents the \"Paris Charter Against Cancer Awards,\" which annually recognize several individuals who have demonstrated their commitment to the fight against cancer.\nAmong the recipients of the award are notably scientists or institute directors who have been able to advance cancer research, leaders of foundations or associations dedicated to supporting patients, as well as significant donors. The award was notably presented in 2010 to the Princess of Morocco, Lalla Salma, President of the Lalla Salma Foundation for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, or in 2012 to François Pinault. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Battle of Nowa Woda was an armed struggle between the forces of Hetman Janusz Radziwill and the Russian Army which took place on 25 June 1654, and ended with a Polish-Lithanian victory.\n\n\n== Situation Before Battle ==\nAfter the tsarist army invaded the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, King Jan Kazimierz convened the Sejm in March under the chairmanship of Franciszek Dubrawski, Chamberlain of Przemyśl, and in July, were broken up by the deputies with a \"Liberum veto\". In addition, no effective methods were devised to defend the Polish-Lithuanian state. Both the grand bullahs (position of hetman), of the Crown and Lithuania, were vacant after the death of Janusz Kiszka, but the King, despite the fact that Prince Radziwiłł was in opposition to him, conferred the mullah on him.\nHowever, fearing similar consequences as those which arose during the reign of King Sigismund through the humiliation of Duke Krzysztof Radziwiłł, the king granted him the position, and Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski became the field hetman.\nThere were disputes between Radziwiłł and Gosiewski. The situation was aggravated by the King's attempts to deprive Radziwiłł of his post, it was also made worse by the fact that Gosiewski was a treasurer and had no intention of donating money to pay the Lithuanian army. In this atmosphere actions were initiated.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAlthough with a small number of soldiers, Radziwill was eager for a clash, like any strategist in those days. There was a need for reconnaissance, so Radziwill sent Ganzhoff with a detachment consisting of several light banners and dragoujes, in general 2500 men, to Dochorobuzh. Ganzhoff, passing Smolensk, on June 25 met the Moscow forces at Novaya Voda numbering 8,000. The Tsar's army was celebrating St John's Day. After the Russian soldiers got drunk and fell asleep, Gallzhoff took advantage of this and attacked in the night. The battle lasted until morning. When he saw fresh troops coming, Ganzhoff retreated to Orsha where there was a Lithuanian camp.\nIn honour of victory in a battle Ganzhoff carried 13 banners to Radziwill, also 7 Bojars were taken prisoner. \n\n\n== Aftermatch ==\nAfter breaking up the Russian forces, at the same time Rotmistrz Lipnitsky achieved victory by dispersing the Moscow forces at the river Dzvina and near Polon, and captured several major Bojars, including Boris Marchalov, the Tsar's Podchai. The Tsar laid siege to Smolensk, which capitulated. Not waiting, Radziwill moved with his army in August, where he smashed a 40-thousand-strong Russian detachment in the great battle of Skhlow.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mikhail Valerijevicj Mikusjin is a former scientist and suspected Russian intelligence agent, who was arrested in October 2022 in Norway. He is charged with espionage against Norway.\nMikusjin had an internship at University of Tromsø and posed as a Brazilian researcher named José Assis Giammaria. He later revealed that he is a Russian citizen.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMikusjin has a bachelor's degree in political science with a focus on international relations at the Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies in Canada. He also has a master's degree from the University of Calgary.\nIn autumn 2021, he came to Norway as a visiting researcher where he worked at Centre for Peace Studies at UiT, dealing with topics such as social security, preparedness and hybrid threats.\n\n\n== Espionage case ==\nOn 20 October 2022, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security sent a warning about the Brazilian visiting researcher José Assis Giammaria who worked at UiT, in which they believed that he was a \"threat to fundamental national interests\".\nOn 24 October, Mikusjin was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), and the following day he was brought before the Nord-Troms and Senja District Court, where the PST believed that he was an illegalist who worked for the Russian intelligence service and asked for deportation from Norway.\nOn 28 October, the Oslo District Court decided to remand him for four weeks, subject to a ban on letters and visits for the entire period of imprisonment and complete isolation for two weeks. On 25 November, Mikusjin was remanded in custody for another four weeks.\nThe Russian embassy in Oslo maintained that they did not know the researcher and would not comment on the charge. In November 2022, it became known that Brazilian authorities were investigating the researcher and were considering requesting his extradition.\nIn December 2023, the researcher stated that his real name is Mikhail Valeryevich Mikushin and that he is a Russian citizen.\n\n\n== Connection to Russian intelligence ==\nEarly in the investigation, PST believed that the researcher was a Russian citizen whose real name was Mikhail Valerievich Mikushin, born on 19 August 1978 in Russia, and who was working on behalf of Russian intelligence.\nAccording to Bellingcat, Mikushin is a colonel in the Russian intelligence service GRU.\n\n\n== Charge ==\nOn 28 October 2022, Mikusjin was first charged by the PST with violating Section 121 of the Norwegian Penal Code on \"Intelligence-gathering activity targeting state secrets\" and Section 126b of the Criminal Code, which deals with illegal intelligence that may harm other states' security interests. In December 2022, the charge was changed to a violation of Section 122 of the penal code (aggravated intelligence-gathering activity targeting state secrets).\nIn April 2024, PST had finished the investigation and forwarded it to the National Authority for Prosecution of Organised and other Serious Crime for assessment of charges.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joel T. Rosenthal is a medieval historian and the author of several scholarly books and articles. He is Distinguished professor and Emeritus of History at the State University of New York in Stony Brook. He is a fellow of the Medieval Academy of America and the Royal Historical Society. He gained his doctorate in 1963 from the University of Chicago—where he took seminars under Sylvia L. Thrupp—with a dissertation on Richard, 3rd Duke of York.\nRosenthal's particular interests and specialisms have varied over his career, but have been generally on English social history, including aspects such as noble family life—including women and children—old age, widows, religion, and English personal names. Interests outside and beyond both England and the Late Middle Ages have focused on Anglo-Saxons, Capetians, and pedagogy. He has co-edited books—for example, the Garland Encyclopedia of Medieval England—as well as journals, such as Medieval Prosopography.\n\n\n== Significant works ==\nFor a complete chronology of Rosenthal's publications, see Christine Fox's 2018 bibliography.\n\nThe Purchase of Paradise: Gift Giving and the Aristocracy, 1307–1485: London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972.\nAngles, Angels, and Conquerors: New York: Random House, 1973.\nNobles and the Noble Life, 1295–1500: London: Allen and Unwin; New York: Barnes and Noble, 1976.\nAnglo-Saxon History: An Annotated Bibliography, 450–1066: New York: Abrahams Magazine Services Press, 1985.\nPatriarchy and Families of Privilege in Fifteenth-Century England: Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991.\nOld Age in Late Medieval England: Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996.\nTelling Tales: Sources and Narration in Late Medieval England: University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003.\nFrom the Ground Up: A History of the State University of New York at Stony Brook: New York: 116 Press, 2004.\nMargaret Paston, Matriarch of the Paston Family: Dereham, UK: Larks Press, 2009.\nMargaret Paston’s Piety: New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010.\nChristianity and the Church in Post-Conquest England: New York: Oxford University Press, 2010.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Senate elections will be held in Thailand on 26 June 2024, the first of its kind under the 2017 Constitution. Under the Constitution, the transitional Senate of Thailand will expire on 10 May 2024. Afterwards, the following Senates will be a 200-member body and have no power to elect Prime Ministers. \nThis will be the first election to utilize the highly complex electoral system envisioned by the 2018 Organic Act on the Acquisition of Senators. Its members will be elected among the independent candidates, without participation from outside the candidate pool. The elections were already criticized for the complexity, secrecy and confusion of the voting system.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Thai Senate has undergone several reformations since it was originally established in 1947. On various occasions, the Senate has been appointed, directly elected, indirectly elected, or some combination of these. Under the present 2017 Constitution, which was promulgated in the aftermath of the 2014 Thai coup d'état, provided for a 5-year transitional Senate appointed by the National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta that governed Thailand from the coup in 2014 until 2019, followed by \"permanent\" Senates.\nThe transitional Senate is composed of 250 members handpicked by the junta. It had the power to vote for Prime Minister, alongside members of the House of Representatives. It voted overwhelmingly for Prayut Chan-o-cha in 2019 and Srettha Thavisin in 2023. This provision came under intense public scrutiny during the 2023 Prime Ministerial election, when Senators refused to back the election of Pita Limjaroenrat, despite a large majority of the House supporting his candidacy. \nAfter the transitional Senate expires on 10 May 2024, the following Senates are indirectly elected via a highly complex election system, intended to produce a technocratic institution. The 2024 elections will be the first to use this system. The permanent Senate will not have the power to vote for Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== 2023 elections ===\n\nThe government of Prayut Chan-o-cha was defeated in a landslide in the 2023 House of Representatives elections. The Move Forward Party won the most seats, with Pheu Thai Party in second place. An attempt to form a coalition government between the two parties failed, after Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat failed to be elected prime minister, largely because of opposition from the conservative Senate.\nInstead, the government was formed by Pheu Thai's Srettha Thavisin. The Srettha Cabinet is supported by the conservative Bhumjaithai Party and Chart Thai Pattana Party, as well as Prayut-aligned parties such as Palang Pracharath Party and United Thai Nation Party.\n\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe permanent Senate of Thailand is composed of 200 senators, chosen by and among \"persons having the knowledge, expertise, experience, profession, or characteristics or common interests or working or having worked in varied areas of the society\". It is a non-partisan body, and all candidates will run as independents. Senators serve five-year terms for only one term limits. The rules for the election are laid down in the 2018 Organic Act on the Acquisition of Senators.\nCandidates must be Thai nationals by birth, at least 40 years old, and have a minimum of 10 years expirence in their field. The 20 groups include:\n\nPublic administration and national security group\nLaw and justice group\nEducation group\nPublic health group\nRice or emblements farmer group\nOrchardists, persons who work in forests, ranch, and fishing group\nEmployees excluding governmental employees group\nPersons who work in the environmental, city planning, real estate and utilities, natural resource, and energy field group\nSME entrepreneurs and other group\nEntrepreneurs other than (9) group\nPersons who work in the tourism field group\nIndustrialists and similar group\nPersons who work in the scientific, technological, communications, innovative, or similar field group\nWomen group\nElderly, disabled, ethnic minority and other identity groups\nArts, culture, music, performance and entertainment group\nNGOs group\nPersons in sports, mass media and literature group\nFreelancer group\nOther group\nThey must have some connection to the district they seek to contest in. They must also pay a 2,500 baht (US$67.46) application fee. Candidates cannot be members of a political party. Also prohibited from contesting are civil servants, current and former member of parliaments, former government ministers, former local administrators, former political party executives (unless they have been out of their post for at least five years), parents, spouses and children of senatorial candidates. Members of the transitional Senate cannot run.\nSenators are elected among applicant candidates pool, without any participation from non-candidates. Each candidate applies to represent one of 20 eligible groups, and ten senators will be elected from each group. There are six rounds of voting, two each at the district, provincial, and national level. Notably, the public cannot observe the voting process, except the candidates themselves.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nAt the district level, the candidates will vote within their group. In each district, the five candidates in each group with the most votes will advance to the second round. In the second round, each candidate will be assigned 3–5 random groups (other than their own), and vote for the candidates in those groups. The top three candidates in each group in each district will then advance, for a total of 60 candidates in each district.\nThe provincial level process will occur on 16 June. Because the number of districts in each province varies (anywhere between three and 50), the number of candidates in each province will vary significantly. Candidates will first narrow the number of candidates in their group to 5. They will then again vote for candidates in other groups. They may or may not be assigned the same groups to vote in at the provincial level than at the district level. There will now be 2 candidates in each group in each province, for a total of 3,080 remaining candidates nationwide.\nThe process will then move on to the national level, where the remaining 3,080 candidates will repeat the intra and inter-group voting to elect 10 senators from each of the 20 groups.\nThe number of candidates each voter is allowed to vote for varies depending on the round. The system lends itself to limited voting. At the district and provincial level, each voter will have two votes within their group, and one vote for the inter-group election. At the national level, a voter may have ten votes for the intra-group election, and five for the inter-group election. The candidates with the most votes will proceed, and all others will be eliminated. There is no minimum threshold of votes required to be elected. Candidates may vote for themselves in the intra-group elections. A voter may not cast more than one vote for a single candidate. A voter does not need to use all of their votes.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe electoral system is controversial. Critics have referred to it as \"the most complicated election in the world\".\nOther criticism centers on the system's alleged vulnerability to manipulation. Because any eligible person can run, district-level elections can be packed in order to ensure the election of particular candidates. The 2018 election for the transitional Senate utilized a similar system, although most senators were ultimately selected by the junta. Candidates who participated in the process alleged vote buying, saying that desired candidates utilized their professional connections to be elected.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe Election Commission is expected to publish the list of elected senators in the Royal Gazette in 2 July.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The death of Clara Nunes occurred on April 2, 1983, and was caused by anaphylactic shock triggered by halothane at the São Vicente Clinic in Rio de Janeiro. Before her death, she spent 28 days in a coma with immediate brain death after suffering anaphylaxis during surgery to remove varicose veins from her legs on March 5 of that year. There was considerable speculation regarding the cause of Clara's coma. The work of the doctors who attended her and her relationship with her husband, songwriter Paulo César Pinheiro, were thoroughly analyzed by the press and her fans. An investigation conducted by the Regional Council of Medicine of Bahia, commissioned by the Regional Council of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro (which was unable to investigate because the Federal Council of Medicine had intervened) concluded that Clara had not suffered a medical error. The cause of death presented on her death certificate was \"hypersensitivity to halothane\", a gas administered during surgery as an anesthetic.\n\n\n== Surgery background ==\nAfter undergoing a hysterectomy in 1979 due to a proliferating myoma in her uterus, Clara Nunes started receiving sclerotherapy treatment, which consists of injecting medication directly into the varicose veins. Over time, the caliber of the veins decreases and the vessels close up. Angiologist Antonio Vieira de Mello was chosen by Clara to conduct the treatment on the recommendation of Cézar Seminario, her gynecologist. She wished to treat some protruding varicose veins that bothered her aesthetically. She attributed the pain she felt in her legs to varicose veins, which was considered exaggerated by people close to her.\nImproving the look of her legs became an obsession for Clara, who had always been very vain. Her concern became more relevant when thicker varicose veins appeared, which could only be treated by surgery. In June 1982, after performing at the Horizonte Latin American Art Festival in West Berlin, Clara phoned her friend Bibi Ferreira from the hotel room where she was staying to tell her that she was worried about her varicose veins. Clara reportedly told her friend that she was dancing at the front of the stage when she noticed that everyone was looking at her legs, at the level of her shins, and notified her friend of her decision to have surgery to remove her varicose veins after returning to Brazil. Bibi tried to convince her that the concern was silly, but said that she should have the surgery if she was really bothered.\n\n\n== Surgery ==\nClara scheduled the surgery for March 5, 1983. Doctor Antonio Vieira de Mello headed the surgical team. She asked for complete secrecy to avoid any press reports. The date chosen for the surgery followed Carnival (celebrated on February 15 that year), when Clara had paraded for the last time in the Portela and the Clube do Samba carnival block, which she had helped to found in January 1979. About two weeks before the surgery, she submitted to another minor procedure at the ophthalmology clinic of Marcos Wajnberg to remove a chalazion. According to Wajnberg, \"in this case, the surgery was not for aesthetic reasons, but out of necessity. The chalazion is harmful and has to be removed\".\nOn the day scheduled for the surgery, Clara got up early and headed to the São Vicente Clinic in Gávea, accompanied by her friend Vilarinda Marçal de Faria, whom Clara had asked to come from Paraopeba to help her in the days following the operation. According to her husband Paulo César, who found out about the surgery in late February, Clara decided not to have epidural anesthesia because she was afraid of becoming paralyzed if there was a medical error.\nClara arrived at the clinic and went straight to her room. When the anesthesiologist Américo Salgueiro Autran Filho arrived, Clara informed him that she had opted for general anesthesia. The doctors tried to convince her to abandon the idea, explaining the advantages of the epidural, and that general anesthesia, in the case of small surgeries, could cause complications. In the end, they agreed to Clara's request.\nAfter Américo applied the anesthesia to Clara, Antonio Vieira began to operate on her. She had been anesthetized with a mixture of halothane, nitrogen protoxide and oxygen. Her right leg had already been operated on and her left leg was being sutured when Antonio noticed that Clara's blood was very dark and gushing out in large quantities. He asked Américo to check her blood pressure, as she was suffering a cardiac arrest. Antonio ordered the anesthetic outlet to be closed and the oxygen supply to the tracheal tube to be increased to 100%. Manual resuscitation had already begun, but was interrupted due to heart fibrillation. Clara was revived with a defibrillator, but did not respond voluntarily to stimuli, indicating that she had fallen into a coma.\nClara had suffered a strong allergic reaction to one of the components used in the anesthetic, which caused a generalized dilation of all the blood capillaries in her body. Her brain failed to withstand the pressure and a huge edema formed, causing her immediate brain death. At 3:40 in the afternoon, Clara was taken to the clinic's Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\n\n== Coma period and repercussions ==\n\nAccording to the medical team, if Clara survived, she would have very serious sequelae due to the lack of oxygen in her brain. Her husband, Paulo César, began to closely monitor her medical condition, as did her family, who left Minas Gerais to take care of her. At his request, who hoped that the situation would be reversed, the case was kept under wraps, but ended up leaking to the press two days later.\nAs soon as the information about Clara's state of health was published, Engenheiro Alfredo Dutra Street, where she lived, and the São Vicente Clinic were crowded with reporters. At this point, it had already been reported that Clara had suffered anaphylactic shock as a result of surgery, but different versions of the motives behind her surgical procedure began to circulate, such as artificial insemination, abortion and a suicide attempt. It was also rumored that the anaphylactic shock was caused by the huge amount of whiskey she had drunk the night before the surgery and that she was a drug user.\nDozens of fans and artists arrived at the São Vicente Clinic, which became the place for hysterical crises and prayers. Rosemary, Elizeth Cardoso, Dori Caymmi, Grande Otelo, João Nogueira, Dona Zica, Mauro Duarte, Fafá de Belém, Paulinho da Viola, Luiz Ayrão, Roberto Ribeiro, Alcione, Elza Soares, Beth Carvalho, Chico Buarque, Marieta Severo and Baby Consuelo are among the artists who went to the clinic.\nBaby Consuelo had one of the most tense moments when she tried to enter the ICU with Thomaz Green Morton, a medicine man who had convinced several artists that his \"paranormal powers\" cured serious illnesses. However, she was blocked by Maria Gonçalves Pereira and Branca, Clara's sisters. While Clara was in a coma, all kinds of healers appeared, but Paulo César Pinheiro prevented most of them from entering. One of the few medicine men he allowed into the ICU was the Chinese acupuncturist called Mister Wu, who tried to revive Clara using an acupuncture technique called moxibustion.\nNone of the attempts were successful. Clara had no brain activity and the doctors were aware that her vital functions would cease at any moment. Ten days after the onset of the coma, the real extent of the edema was discovered when Clara was taken for a CT scan at Santa Casa. At the hospital, they concluded that nothing could be done to prevent her death due to the size of the edema. Faced with Paulo César's silence and the uninformative medical reports, the media demanded that the doctors hold a press conference and that the operating room be opened for an inspection of the equipment. In the third week of March, the head of anesthesia guided members of the press around the clinic. There were suspicions that the anesthesiologist Américo Salgueiro had been absent from the room during the surgery, that a medical error had occurred in her care and that there had been a failure in the equipment that released oxygen. Veja magazine interviewed an employee of the operating room who said that there was indeed a lack of oxygen during the operation.\n\n\n== Death, wake and burial ==\nIn the early hours of April 2, 1983, Clara's vital functions began to disappear. At 4:30 in the morning, she died of heart failure after spending 28 days in a coma. Maria Gonçalves and Paulo César Pinheiro contacted Portela's president, Nezinho, to arrange for the funeral to take place at the school's headquarters in Madureira. Radio stations announced the her death and fans flocked to the clinic door and the Portelão. As a safety measure, Clara's body was transported by ambulance from the São Vicente Clinic to Portela's headquarters. After the body was placed in the coffin, six soldiers from the Military Police led it to the center of the court to the applause of the more than 5,000 people who had gathered there. Meanwhile, programming on Brazil's main television networks was interrupted with live flashes from the clinic and the Portela's court; on the radio, the hits from Clara's latest album, Nação, played incessantly.\nAt the time, only 30 soldiers from the Military Police were securing the site, as well as some private security guards from Portela. Six security guards from TV Globo were also present and acted truculently, pushing the public and reporters away from the center of the court. Some of the people present fell from a stage about two meters high. There was a rush of pushing and falling and the coffin nearly fell to the ground. Shortly afterwards, there was a second riot, with people running into the street. Some felt ill and at least one person fainted from lack of air. The Portela management, unable to control the situation, took refuge in a room with Clara's family. The Military Police shock battalion was called in to contain the crowd. Overall, 50,000 people passed through the Portela's headquarters to say goodbye to Clara.\nAt 4pm, the coffin was closed and covered with the flags of Clube do Samba, Portela, Mangueira, Caprichosos de Pilares and Império Serrano. A fire department truck took the coffin to the São João Batista Cemetery, where Clara was buried at 6pm after a small uproar at the time of her arrival due to the large number of people who had gathered there.\n\n\n== Religious interpretation ==\nClara Nunes was one of the main exponents of Afro-Brazilian religiosity through her music. As a result, her death was subject to religious interpretation. Some Umbanda practitioners said she had been reckless to operate during Lent. The pai-de-santo Edu, who was Clara's guide until he split up with Paulo César Pinheiro, had warned her not to have surgery during that period. Clara had opted for general anesthesia because of advice he had given her. He later exonerated himself from any blame for Clara's death, claiming that she was following the guidance of the wrong orishas.\nAccording to neo-Pentecostalism, Clara's death was caused by the intercession of a demonic spirit. According to Edir Macedo, founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God and current owner of Record, the demonic possession was revealed during an unloading session held in one of his temples. According to him, \"the spirit that was in her was manifested by a person present\" at the time and this spirit said that it would \"take her away\".\nThe day after Clara Nunes' funeral, her grave became a place of pilgrimage for Candomblé and Umbanda worshippers. It remains a popular place to visit to this day, especially for followers of Afro-Brazilian cults, who perform rituals there and leave offerings to her, such as flowers and candles. According to the newspaper O Globo, Clara Nunes' tomb is currently the second most visited in the São João Batista Cemetery during the All Souls' holiday, behind Cazuza's tomb.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nPaulo César Pinheiro decided not to file a lawsuit against the doctors who treated Clara for medical malpractice since he had to authorize the exhumation of her body, which she had expressed her disapproval of before she died. In addition, the Regional Council of Medicine of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Cremerj) was under intervention by the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM) since 1978.\nThe intervention in Cremerj began when two opposition parties disregarded a rule issued by Murilo Belchior, former president of the CFM, which banned the inclusion of candidates with less than five years of training on the ballot. Slate 2, which won the election, did not have the results ratified by the CFM. There are indications that the votes were rejected because the opposition slates were linked to trade unions, which displeased the CFM board, allegedly linked to the military dictatorship. Eventually, the CFM appointed a provisional board for Cremerj with limited functions and composed of members of Slate 1. In 1983, Cremerj decided to investigate the causes of Clara Nunes' death. However, the trial was held by the Regional Council of Medicine of Bahia (Cremeb), chaired at the time by Aristides Maltez Filho.\nJournalist Vagner Fernandes, author of Guerreira da Utopia, Clara Nunes' biography released in 2007, had access to the documents about the investigation into Clara's death, which total five volumes and 815 pages. The documents include Américo Salgueiro's version of the anaphylactic shock, the testimonies of each of the team members who worked on the surgery and those of other witnesses mentioned in news reports, and the medical records detailing which drugs were given to Clara during the 28 days she was hospitalized at São Vicente Clinic. Cremerj's provisional board had decided to gather newspaper clippings and request reports on the case from doctors Antonio Vieira de Mello, Américo Salgueiro Filho and Jacob Cukier (then head of the clinic's ICU). On June 27 and 28, Paulo César Pinheiro, members of the surgical team and directors of the clinic testified to Fernando Marigliano and Artur Ventura, from Cremeb, at Cremerj's former headquarters in Rio de Janeiro.\nAs it had been reported that anesthesiologist Américo Salgueiro had left the operating room to take a phone call, Josélia Alves Pereira, the clinic's operator, was also invited to testify. When asked if any of the doctors from Antonio Vieira's team had been at the call center during her shift, she said no. When asked if any doctors were in the call center at the time of the operation, she said she didn't know, because her shift started at noon (one hour and fifteen minutes after the surgery began). All the team members confirmed that Américo had been in the room continuously. There was media coverage of the fact that the São Vicente Clinic had not asked Clara to undergo drug allergy tests before the surgery, but the clinic argued that this was not standard procedure.\nThe testimonies revealed that, from both a technical and human point of view, there were no flaws. Overall, thirteen people were heard. The councilors' report was based on the evidence presented by the doctors and the testimony of witnesses. It was unanimously approved at a plenary session held on July 28, 1983. Cremeb's decision could be appealed. However, Paulo César Pinheiro reportedly said that he would not appeal because he \"didn't believe in this justice system\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n1983 in Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFernandes, Vagner (2007).

        "content": "On 24 October 1983, 24-year-old Singaporean housewife Khor Gek Hong (许玉凤 Xǔ Yùfèng) was attacked and stabbed to death by her lover along Kim Seng Road, Singapore. Khor's lover, 31-year-old welder Wong Foot Ling (黄福麟 Huáng Fúlín), surrendered himself two days after the fatal stabbing, and he was charged with murder. During Wong's trial, it was revealed that Wong was angered at Khor choosing to return to her husband rather than continuing their relationship with one another, and it caused Wong to commit the murder. Although Wong raised the defences of having killed Khor in a fight and killing Khor under a loss of self-control via sudden and grave provocation, the High Court judged that Wong had intentionally stabbed Khor, which in turn caused Khor to die from her wounds and hence, Wong was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging in August 1984. Wong's appeal was dismissed and he was hanged on 19 September 1986.\n\n\n== Khor Gek Hong's death ==\nOn the night of 24 October 1983, a woman was attacked and grievously stabbed by a male attacker while she was waiting for a taxi along Kim Seng Road. Shortly after the ruthless stabbing, the perpetrator was last seen fleeing the area in his car.\nThe victim, who was pronounced dead at Singapore General Hospital, was identified as 24-year-old Khor Gek Hong, who was an ex-hostess and housewife married with a two-year-old son and the seventh of eight children in her family. The stabbing incident was witnessed by multiple people right in the public eye, and it caused shock among the bystanders who seen the killer stabbing Khor to death. One of the witnesses, a salesman, told the press that he originally believed it was a spousal conflict when he saw Khor and her assailant struggling with one another, before his thoughts were proven wrong by the man brutally stabbing Khor to death, and he managed to take down the car registration number of the vehicle used by Khor's murderer to flee the scene. Reportedly, Khor, despite being mortally wounded, managed to fight off her killer and escaped to a grocery store, where she used a public telephone to call her 51-year-old mother Poh Ah Lee, who rushed down from her 8th floor flat to tend to her daughter. Poh later told police that herdaughter was actually attacked and strangled by a man whose feelings were rejected by Khor, who claimed she was happily married to her husband and seaman Foo See Teck (alias Peter), although the family did not make a repot after they informed the man's parents about what he did, with hopes to stop the man from coming after Khor. A knife was later recovered from the scene.\nDr Wee Keng Poh, a senior forensic pathologist, conducted a post-mortem examination on the deceased. Dr Wee discovered that Khor had been stabbed a total of ten times on her body with a sharp instrument, and out of all the ten wounds, one of them (measured 6 cm in depth) was inflicted from the back and it penetrated the lung and caused massive bleeding, and this particular injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.\nThe murder of Khor Gek Hong was one of the two murder cases involving female victims to happen within the same week. The second case was the murder of Wong Ah Peng, a 19-year-old Ipoh-born prostitute found dead with her flat ransacked on 26 October 1983. Wong's murderer, a Kedah-born bread seller named Wong Kim Poh, was arrested five years later in Malaysia in 1988, before he was extradited back to Singapore, where he was tried and sentenced to hang in 1990 for murdering the teenager.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nThe Singapore Police Force classified the death of Khor Gek Hong as murder, and the case was transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for official investigations. The police eventually closed in on one suspect, whom they identified as a 31-year-old Singaporean named Wong Foot Ling (alias Ah Beng; 阿明 A Míng), a welder and ex-lover of Khor, and placed him on the wanted list. The police also sent out a public appeal for information leading to Wong's arrest.\nOn 26 October 1983, Wong surrendered himself to the police for allegedly killing Khor. The following day after his surrender, 31-year-old Wong Foot Ling was charged with murder in a district court, and subsequently remanded without bail. No plea was recorded from Wong during his appearance in court.\n\n\n== Trial of Wong Foot Ling ==\n\nOn 6 August 1984, ten months after his arrest, Wong Foot Ling was officially brought to trial for the murder of Khor Gek Hong from the previous year. The prosecution was led by Lawrence Ang while Wong himself was represented by Nathan Isaac during his trial, which was presided by two judges - Justice Abdul Wahab Ghows and Justice T S Sinnathuray.\nThe trial court was told that prior to Khor's marriage, both Khor and Wong, who were neighbours, first knew one another since 1973 and had once shared an intimate relationship with each other. SHortly after Khor was married to Foo See Teck on 11 May 1978, Khor rekindled her relationship with Wong, and while Khor's husband was sailing out, they often would go out together secretly for trips, even having sex on some occasions. Throughout her relationship with Wong, Khor tried several times to seek a divorce but her husband, who knew about the affair through his family, refused to grant her a divorce and wanted to maintain his marriage with Khor, or otherwise he would commit suicide together with their son. Khor also refused Wong's offer to elope with him for the sake of her son. Eventually, Khor chose to stay with her husband and give her marriage a chance. This dashed away all of Wong's hopes to marry Khor after splitting with Foo, and according to the prosecution, it became the motive of Wong's merciless attack on Khor before he killed her. It was also noted that Khor often changed her mind between choosing to give her heart to Wong and staying with her husband, which made the judges call her a \"fickle-minded\" woman in their verdict of Wong's murder trial.\nAccording to Wong's confession, he had tried strangling Khor in a love suicide pact due to her distress over the failure to secure a divorce from her husband, but he could not bring himself to continue on after seeing her suffering, and a day later, he only learned that Khor chose to return to her husband, which greatly saddened Wong. Wong also told the police that on the day of the murder, he was driving along Kim Seng Road when he chanced upon Khor and he decided to approach Khor, offering her a lift. However, Khor refused, and their conversation escalated into an argument over Khor's feelings for both Wong and Foo, and Wong failed to force Khor to go with him into his car. Afterwards, Wong went into his car and retrieved a knife, and he therefore plunged the knife into Khor's back while she was in a kneeling position, and knifed her to death. Chua Aik Hock, the sales representative who took down Wong's car registration number, testified that he saw Wong stabbing Khor at least five times from behind while Khor was in a kneeling position. Chua's colleague, Shum Sun Seng, corroborated Chua's testimony when he came to court as well. Khor's husband also appeared in court as a witness and he testified that when he and his mother-in-law received a telephone call from the dying Khor, she told her that it was \"Ah Beng\", which was Wong's alias, who stabbed her.\nIn his defence, Wong claimed that after approaching Khor moments before the murder, he was scolded by Khor for having revealed to her mother about the two abortions she underwent due to their past intimacy. Wong also testified in court that their argument gotten worse and it gave rise to the hostility between the couple. Wong also sated that as a result of uncontrollable anger, he went back to his car to retrieve a knife and therefore stabbed Khor. In rebuttal, during their cross-examination, the prosecution sought to argue that Wong had intentionally killed Khor in the \"most cruel fashion\" after coming to the conclusion that he was never going to have her and as resulted from his anger towards her, which Wong continued to deny while on the stand. Apart from this, the defence argued that Wong acted under sudden and grave provovation and thus killed Khor as a result, and even stated there was a sudden fight erupting between both lovers and Khor's death was an unintended consequence of the fight. Even so, the prosecution refuted that Wong's defences should not stand, and they cited that in the absence of an intention to kill, an offender can still be convicted of murder if he/she had intentionally inflicted fatal bodily injuries on the victim, as defined under Section 300(c) of the Penal Code. They also cited that given the number of wounds sustained by the deceased, it cannot be said that Wong had not meant to cause harm on Khor and he had the intention to stab Khor, which in turn led to her death.\nOn 10 August 1984, Justice T S Sinnathuray and Justice Abdul Wahab Ghows delivered their verdict, with Justice Sinnathuray pronouncing the decision in court. In the joint judgement, Justice Sinnathuray found that there was no sudden fight between both Khor and Wong, and Khor was in a kneeling position when Wong knifed her to death, and she herself was unarmed and wanted to leave. Also, the two judges found that there was no provocation from Khor as she was then on the way to visit a friend and refused the offer by Wong to drive her, which in turn led to Wong murdering her in a fit of anger. Since the judges rejected Wong's defences, and also determining that Wong had the intention to cause bodily injuries during the stabbing, such that one of the wounds caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of Khor, Wong's actions constituted as an act of murder under the law and the judges thus concluded that there were sufficient grounds to return with a guilty verdict of murder.\nIn conclusion, both Justice Sinnathuray and Justice Abdul Wahab found 32-year-old Wong Foot Ling guilty of murdering Khor Gek Hong, and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty – the sole legal punishment permitted for murder in Singapore – under Section 302 of the Penal Code.\n\n\n== Appeal ==\nIn April 1985, it was reported that Wong was in midst of appealing against his conviction and sentence at the Court of Appeal. Similarly, another ten out of 15 other people on death row (alongside Wong) were separately filing appeals against the death penalty, most of whom were convicted of either murder or drug trafficking.\nOn 20 May 1985, Wong lost his appeal against the murder conviction and death sentence. The three judges – Justice Lai Kew Chai, Justice L P Thean (Thean Lip Ping) and Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin – affirmed the trial court's decision to convict Wong of murder based on the reasons they similarly found in Wong's case, and noting that Khor was in a kneeling position when Wong stabbed her several times in front of the witnesses, they had no doubt that Wong had indeed committed murder through the definition of his actions under the law, and therefore confirmed Wong's death sentence and murder conviction. On that same day itself, another death row convict and killer Tay Cheng Hoe also lost his appeal against the death sentence he received for murdering 19-year-old Yeo Kee Yong over an alleged motorcycle incident at Jalan Kukoh back in June 1981. Tay's death sentence had since been carried out on an unknown date.\n\n\n== Execution ==\nOn 19 September 1986, 34-year-old Wong Foot Ling was hanged in Changi Prison at dawn. It was revealed in November 1986 that, both Wong and another death row prisoner Ramu Annadavascan had donated their corneas to two women before their death sentences were carried out, which left 18 more inmates remaining on death row. Ramu, who was executed on the same day as Wong, was one of the two men found guilty of murdering 45-year-old boilerman Kalingam Mariappan in 1981 by battering him with a rake and burning him to his death. Ramu's accomplice Rathakrishnan Ramasamy, on the other hand, was spared the gallows due to his age of 16 at the time of the murder and he thus served 20 years of detention at the President's Pleasure. The two women who received the corneas of both Wong and Ramu were reportedly recovering well and were in good condition as of November 1986.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Other Side is an album by American musician T Bone Burnett, released on April 19, 2024, through Verve Records. It includes collaborations with Rosanne Cash, Steven Soles, and the band Lucius. The album received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBurnett wrote and recorded the tracks in a three-week period after purchasing several new guitars while working on the final chapter of the intended trilogy of albums that began with The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space (2019) and The Invisible Light: Spells (2022).\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Other Side received a score of 87 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on reviews from four critics, which the website categorized as \"universal acclaim\". Mojo called the album \"probably the most honest reflection of himself he's ever made\", and Uncut described it as \"supremely inviting, warm and ruefully radiant\" and \"a crown on a career still going strong\".\nJim Hynes of Glide Magazine found it to be a \"return\" to Burnett's \"roots\" as a singer-songwriter and noted that it is \"simple on the surface, basically a country blues effort\" with \"a sneaky quality. It will grow on you after a few listens.\" Mark Deming of AllMusic characterized the album as \"a collection of 12 songs of uncluttered eloquence informed by Burnett's belief in the human spirit, while the arrangements are almost exclusively taken up by acoustic instruments and vocals\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Boyuan Foundation is a Chinese think tank created in 2007 with the ambition to promote political and economic liberal reforms in China. In 2012, a prominent Beijing-based western journalist wrote that the \"Boyuan Foundation exists almost entirely under the radar but may well be the most ambitious, radical and consequential independent panel of advisers in China.\" In 2014, at a time when it was already paring down its operations, it was described by The Economist as \"closely connected to the families of some top leaders and to elite players in the financial system\". It has had little if any observable activity in subsequent years. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Boyuan Foundation was established in 2007 by He Di, former chairman of UBS China, and Qin Xiao, former chairman of China Merchants Group and China Merchants Bank. UBS provided five million US dollars to the foundation, gaining a seat on its board, while He Di contributed one million dollars of his own money. The foundation established its seat in a renovated courtyard house in central Beijing.\nIndividuals who have worked for the foundation as researchers and/or published authors have included Ding Xueliang, Lou Jiwei, and Xu Jilin. By 2013, its board members included Wang Jianxi, Gao Xiqing, and Brent Scowcroft.\nThese and other high-level connections have been reported as providing the foundation some political cover despite vitriolic attacks from the Chinese New Left, and more general political misalignment between the Boyuan Foundation and the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn addition to more discreet meetings, the Boyuan Foundation was a co-organizer of several high-profile public events. In 2012, it co-organized a \"China-Europe Beijing Forum\" in partnership with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. In 2013, it held a flagship event in Beijing, the Chinese Economic Forum, with sponsorship from China Everbright Limited. In the following three years (2014-2016), successive iterations of the Chinese Economic Forum were held in New York in apparent partnership with Peking University.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese Academy of Social Sciences\nUnirule Institute of Economics\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "content": "The Kyiv Caves Patericon or the Kyiv-Pechersk Patericon (Ukrainian: Києво-Печерський патерик), full title: Patericon, or the Life of Saint Fathers of Kyiv Caves is a monument of Old Russian literature, a collection of tales about the monks of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, later Lavra. One of the most original works of Russian hagiographic literature. Its basis consists of texts written by the Bishop of Vladimir and Suzdal, Simon, and the monk of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, Polycarp, supplemented over the centuries with additional biographies of the monks.\n\n\n== Circumstances of creation ==\n\n\n=== Correspondence between Bishop Simon and monk Polycarp ===\n\nThe contemporary-known Kyiv Caves Patericon emerged through the re-editing of the correspondence exchanged in the 1220s between the monk Polycarp and the Bishop of Vladimir and Suzdal, Simon. Despite clearly indicated senders and recipients, most of the correspondence took the form of open letters. Simon treated the written letters not only as a form of spiritual and theological education for Polycarp but also as a means of promoting knowledge about the Kyiv Monastery (where he had once been a monk) and his ideas related to the clergy. This was related to the loss of Kyiv's original significance as an administrative and ecclesiastical center. The description of the lives of selected monks from the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves was meant to preserve their fate from oblivion and remind of the former glory of the monastery. Tadeusz Kołakowski also writes that proving the monastery's significance in the letters was to justify future interventions by its representatives in state affairs and the supremacy of the monastery in the spiritual life of Russia.\nThe oldest surviving part of the exchange of letters between Simon and Polycarp to our times is a passage known as Simon's Epistle, in which the bishop rebukes his spiritual disciple for excessive desire for power, manifested in his eager pursuit of ecclesiastical dignities without the permission of the hegumen of the Kyiv monastery. Simon presents Polycarp with nine biographies of monks from this monastery, recognized as saints, to convince him that the mere fact of belonging to such a distinguished monastery should be a cause for happiness for him. He complements them with several legends about the unknown beginnings of the monastery. In his text, he uses information known to him from his own experience, from the stories of other monks, but also from chronicles and named lists of the deceased.\nPolycarp, in turn, undertook the creation of further biographies of monks. The Epistle, which follows Simon's text, contains 11 more stories written by him on this subject. Polycarp dedicated his work to the hegumen of the monastery, Akindyn. Unlike Simon, Polycarp does not present his text in the form of a letter but openly states that the purpose of his writing about the monks is to preserve the memory of the miracles and signs attributed to them.\n\n\n=== Development of the Kyiv Caves Patericon between the 13th and 15th centuries ===\nThe statements contained in the correspondence between Simon and Polycarp indicate that both authors aimed to create a collection of stories about the revered monks of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves. However, even after their death, the text created in this way continued to be developed and modified. Monks from the Kyiv Monastery added stories that emerged later, while other passages were shortened or removed. The goal of this work was to present the entirety of the monastery's history in the Patericon. Ludmiła Nodzyńska believes that it is not possible to determine unequivocally at which point in the development of the text it received the name by which it is known today. Tadeusz Kołakowski, on the other hand, argues that this title appeared in 1462, in the so-called second Cassian edition.\n\n\n=== Editorials of the Kyiv Caves Patericon created in the 15th century ===\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, at the behest of Bishop Arsenius of Tver (formerly living in the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves), a new edition of the Patericon was compiled. This text, although linguistically retaining the characteristics of the original, for reasons unknown, makes cuts in the text, removing both the Epistles and fragments of narratives (including the entire section dedicated to Alimpius). However, it retains some works authored by the monk Nestor the Chronicler, unrelated to the original Patericon.\nIn the years 1460 and 1462, the monk Cassian of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves prepared two more editions, the second of which was a significant expansion of the first (referred to as the \"first and second Cassian redaction\"). Cassian adapted the language of the texts to his contemporary readers. Serious differences between the two texts lead some researchers to conclude that Cassian was only a co-author of the first version, as evidenced by his listing together with the contents of the first edition under another monk named John. The second Cassian edition served as the most frequently repeated basis for printed editions (the first in 1661 in Kyiv). Compared to the original wording of the Patericon, the second Cassian edition makes significant changes in style and vocabulary: it removes numerous Ruthenian words in favor of Church Slavonic ones, makes the language of the text more solemn, and adds many quotations from the Bible.\n\n\n=== Paterykon ===\nIn 1635, the first translation of the Patericon into Polish was published by Bishop Sylvester Kosiv of Mogilev, titled Paterykon, albo żywoty ss. Ojców Pieczerskich. Kosiv translated the Patericon with the intention of using it as an argument in discussions between Orthodox and Uniate Christians, especially to demonstrate the complete distinctiveness of the Russian Christian tradition from Rome. In preparing the text, he accompanied it with extensive commentary, referring to Russian and Polish chronicles and explaining inconsistencies in the work concerning historical events. Kosiv dedicated his translation to Adam Kisiel.\nThe Kosiv edition, developed based on the second Cassian redaction, modifies the language and style of the original in a similar spirit – softening overly harsh formulations, elevating vocabulary and style, and employing complex rhetorical figures. The known works of Piotr Skarga influenced the shape of Kosiv's translation. Despite these significant departures from the original wording of the Patericon, Kosiv's translation became its most popular version in the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as the basis for subsequent translations into Ukrainian and Russian.\nFurther editions of the Patericon consisted of repetitions of the texts contained in earlier editions. In scholarly works produced in the 20th century, only the original text is used.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nThe Kyiv Caves Patericon, as understood in scholarly literature, i.e., the text compiled by Simon and Polycarp without later modifications, contained the following parts:\n\n\n=== Legends about the establishment of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves ===\nThe Caves Patericon, which recounts the construction of the church, so that everyone would understand that it arose and was accomplished by the intention and will of the Lord Himself, and by the prayer and desire of His Most Pure Mother, it emerged as a fitting temple to God, resembling the heavens, the great church of the Pechersk Lavra of the Holy Mother of God, the archimandrite of all the Rus' land, which is the lavra of our holy and great father Theodosius;\nThe word about the arrival of church masters from Constantinople to Anthony and Theodosius;\nThe word about the founding of the Caves church;\nThe word about the arrival of church painters from Constantinople to Hegumen Nikon;\nAbout John and Sergius, an extraordinary miracle before the miraculous icon of the Mother of God in the Divine Caves Church;\nThe tale of the holy altar and the consecration of this Great Church of the Mother of God;\nAbout the sealing of the tomb of our holy father Theodosius of the Caves.\n\n\n=== Stories about monks edited by Simon ===\nThe humble Bishop of Vladimir and Suzdal, Simon's epistle to Polycarp, the Caves monk;\nSimon, Bishop of Vladimir and Suzdal's tale of the holy Caves monks. Why one should have devotion and love for the blessed Anthony and Theodosius, the fathers of the caves;\nAbout the blessed Eustratius the Fastidious;\nAbout the humble and greatly patient Nikon the monk;\nAbout the holy martyr Kuksha and Pimen the Fastidious;\nAbout the holy Athanasius the Recluse, who died and rose again the next day and lived for 12 years;\nAbout the blessed Svatosha, the prince of Chernihiv;\nAbout Erazm the monk, who lost his property on holy icons and gained salvation through them;\nAbout Areta the monk, whose stolen property was counted as alms by thieves, and thereby he was saved;\nAbout two brothers, Titus the priest and Evagrius the deacon, who quarreled with each other.\n\n\n=== Stories about monks edited by Polycarp ===\nThe second epistle to our Caves archimandrite Akindyn concerning the holy and blessed Caves monks, our brothers, written by Polycarp, a monk of the same Caves monastery;\nAbout Nikita the Recluse, who later became a bishop in Novgorod;\nAbout Lawrence the Recluse;\nAbout the holy and blessed Agapetus, the physician who refused payment;\nAbout St. Gregory the Miracle-Worker;\nAbout the greatly patient John the Recluse;\nAbout the venerable Moses the Hungarian;\nAbout Prochorus the monk, who made bread from a plant called \"lebioda\" through prayer, and salt from ashes;\nAbout the venerable Mark of the Caves, whose commandments were obeyed even by the dead;\nThe word about the holy venerable fathers Theodore and Basil;\nAbout the holy Spirydon the Prosphora-Baker and Alimp the Icon-Painter;\nAbout the holy sufferer Father Pimen and those who desire monasticism before death.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Style of the text ===\n\nThe individual parts of the Patericon clearly differ stylistically. The texts written by Simon indicate erudition in patristic literature and a striving for an elegant, lofty style. However, this style diminishes when the author mentions events known to him from personal experience or from the accounts of other monks – they are written in a much simpler manner. Fragments edited by Polycarp are characterized by greater caution in the selection of quotations, which the author seeks to present by referring to credible sources. Due to his presence in Kyiv at the time of writing, Polycarp had wider access to monastery archives than Simon and more faithfully reflected the contemporary realities of monastic life. His stories about the monks approach the conventions of folk tales, which leads some researchers to directly derive them from the tradition of oral transmission.\n\n\n=== Characteristics of the stories ===\nThe tales of the monks of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves combine the characteristics of chronicle accounts, orally transmitted folk tales, hagiographic texts (the ubiquitous presence of supernatural beings, numerous visions, and miracles), or even folk tales (characteristic devilish figures in Polycarp's stories). A clear source of inspiration is the Holy Scripture, which manifests not only in the abundance of direct quotations but also in plot references (similarities between episodes from the lives of the monks and events from the lives of Old Testament prophets and leaders). Many motifs of miracles described in the work appear in almost unchanged form in other saints' legends originating in Rus and later. However, elements constituting the replication of the hagiographic scheme are intertwined with detailed depictions of monastic life and, to a lesser extent, the society of Rus, making the Patericon a unique work in its genre.\nThe stories also address broader issues. Through examples from the lives of individual monks, the Kyiv Caves Patericon formulates a message regarding the relationship between the monastic community and secular authority; not hiding that disputes occurred between them, it unequivocally supports the monks. The stories about the individual monks are quite schematic. By repeating well-known hagiographic patterns, they focus on emphasizing the extraordinary piety of the monks through descriptions of the ascetic traditions they practiced, followed by the miracles they performed.\n\n\n== Meaning ==\nIn the history of literature, the Kyiv Caves Patericon is an example of the process of transferring earlier Eastern Christian traditions to the Rus' context, in this case, a specific genre of hagiographic literature. The Patericon was also a highly popular work in the Rus' lands, highly regarded by later Ukrainian and Russian literati.\nLudmiła Nodzyńska describes the Kyiv Caves Patericon as one of the three fundamental historical sources for the study of the Christianization of Rus', alongside the Primary Chronicle and the Life of Theodosius of the Caves. However, she emphasizes that the nature of all three texts, combining hagiography with an account of known facts to the author, requires their specific treatment. The facts cited in the Patericon must be confronted with other source materials and located in the broader context of the tradition of the Caves Monastery. The most valuable are the depictions of monastery life presented in the text, which – while maintaining the hagiographic poetics – provide a credible picture of the formation of the Kyiv monastic tradition as an adaptation of the life rules developed by Theodore the Studite to the Rus' context.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarański, Z.; Semczuk, A., eds.

        "content": "Irina is an album by the Barry Altschul Quartet, led by drummer Altschul, and featuring saxophonist John Surman, trumpeter Enrico Rava, and double bassist Mark Helias. It was recorded on February 12, 1983, at Barigozzi Studio in Milan, Italy, and was released on vinyl later that year by Soul Note. The album was remastered and reissued on CD in 1998.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote: \"The music... finds the pianoless group sounding halfway between the Gerry Mulligan/Chet Baker Quartet and the late-'50s Ornette Coleman/Don Cherry group... The advanced and passionate solos... and the close communication between the four highly individual improvisers make this a notable and highly recommended release.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings stated: \"This doesn't feel like fully three-dimensional Altschul. In the absence of a piano, he takes on an accompanist's role and does it very successfully, often leaving Helias to keep the count, though his own metre is rock steady. Rava and Surman don't quite gel early on and the album really comes alight only towards the end.\"\nSteve Holtje of MusicHound Jazz called the album \"Altschul's masterpiece as a leader,\" and noted that the musicians \"walk the fine line between adding their own considerable inspiration yet not overwhelming the leader's concepts.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Tap-A-Jack\" (Ray Anderson) – 7:56\n\"Irina\" (Barry Altschul) – 7:12\n\"Da Baron's Blues\" (Barry Altschul) – 8:17\n\"Sips\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:14\n\"Le Tango\" (Mark Helias) – 7:42\n\"Jitterbug Waltz\" (Fats Waller) – 9:11\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums\nJohn Surman – baritone saxophone, soprano saxophone\nEnrico Rava – trumpet, flugelhorn\nMark Helias – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Heinrich Meier (born 8 April 1953) is a German philosopher. He has published on subjects including political theology, Leo Strauss and Carl Schmitt. He led the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation from 1985 to 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs a young man, Meier was engaged in radical politics as a nationalist and as a socialist, but became disillusioned with both ideologies. He began his academic career with studies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He then came to focus on political theology, Friedrich Nietzsche and Leo Strauss.\nMeier's book Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: The Hidden Dialogue (1988) is about the both open and private intellectual exchange between Carl Schmitt and Strauss. Meier argues that political theology is at the centre of Schmitt's work and that his influence on Strauss was considerable.\nIn The Lesson of Carl Schmitt: Four Chapters on the Distinction between Political Theology and Political Philosophy (1994), Meier further analyses Schmitt as a political theologian.\nMeier was the editor of Strauss' collected works in German. Meier's book Leo Strauss and the Theologico-Political Problem (2003) evaluates Strauss and his critics, with the aim of encouraging self-criticism among philosophers. The book argues that Strauss' main concern was never politics, but the conflict between reason and revelation.\nRobert Howse is critical of Meier's interpretation of the Schmitt–Strauss connection, arguing that Meier both exaggerates Schmitt's influence on Strauss and gives it an unfounded political dimension. Howse argues that the relationship between them was merely professional.\nFrom 1985 to 2022, Meier was the managing director of the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation. Since 1999, he has taught as Honorarprofessor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFaculty page – Ludwig Maximilian University",

        "content": "The Virtanen type Finnish surnames are the surnames that became popular in the  19th century in western Finland that are formed by combining of a word related to nature (but not an animal) with the suffix -nen. The name of the type was introduced by Finnish expert in naming Sirkka Paikkala after the surname Virtanen, the most common surname of this  type (Until 2009 it was the most common surname in Finland, later superseded by \"Korhonen\".\n).\nThe suffix -nen, commonly used as a diminutive,  was already in use in Eastern Finland (Savonia , Karelia) since the Middle Ages to create surnames in church records from the name of the parent (i.e., used as patronymic, e.g., Pentikäinen). In Western Finland Finns mostly didn't have surnames, and in the era of Finnish national awakening Finns stated acquiring \"Virtanen-type\" surnames, which followed the pattern of the existing surnames in Eastern Finland, but without any personal association, and the suffix '-nen' acquired a new meaning of an abstract surname-generating suffix. There are also some rare old  surnames with suffix '-nen' of unknown origin, such as Korhonen.\nLater, the suffix '-nen' was dropped altogether, and the surnames, such as Lahtinen and Lahti coexist. The surnames like Lahti are called the Laine type surnames, after the surname Laine, the most common one of this type.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On August 23, 2011, as part of the Libyan Crisis (2011–present), members of the Khamis Brigade (a military force loyal to Muammar Gaddafi) carried out summary executions of hostages in a warehouse near Tripoli, Libya, which was then set on fire. In total, 124 people were killed at the site.\n\n\n== Background information ==\nDuring the final stages of the Libyan Civil War, which erupted in February 2011, forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi engaged in brutal crackdowns against rebel groups seeking to overthrow his regime. The Khamis Brigade, led by Gaddafis son Khamis, was known for its involvement in violent suppression tactics.\n\n\n== The massacre ==\nOn August 23, 2011, detainees were held in a warehouse located in the Khalida Ferjan neighborhood in Salahaddin, south of Tripoli, adjacent to the Yarmuk Military Base. The detainees, numbering approximately 153, were almost entirely civilians. These detainees were often beat, electrocuted, starved, and even raped. Guards from the Khamis Brigade conducted a roll call of the detainees and subsequently carried out a vicious attack. Survivors recounted guards opening fire from the roof of the warehouse and throwing grenades into the building. Many detainees were shot and killed during the assault. 53 skulls were later found in one location and other corpses were discovered in a nearby shallow grave but there was a deliberate attempt to destroy victims’ bodies. There are known to be at least 20 survivors. Videos were taken of the site of the massacre, showing the remains of the bodies which were mostly ashes.\n\nSurvivors of the massacre provided testimonies of the events. Abdulrahim Ibrahim Bashir, one of the survivors, said he escaped the onslaught by fleeing over a wall while guards were reloading their weapons. He then hid in a nearby house with some other survivors, some of whom were wounded. When they came out after three days of hiding, they noticed the fire, met the rebel brigades, and discovered the site of the incinerator.\nAbdulrahim recounted witnessing guards killing wounded detainees and identified one of the perpetrators as a soldier named Ibrahim from Tajura. He also testified to being forced to repeat the Shahada using Gaddafis name, and to refer to him as god.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe Yarmuk massacre came to light when National Transitional Council fighters seized the military base on August 26, 2011. They sensed the smell of fire and found the warehouse with smoke rising from it. They followed where the smell was coming from, they then discovered the charred remains of approximately 45 individuals within the warehouse. Human Rights Watch investigated the site and observed bullet holes in the warehouse roof.\n\n\n== Trials ==\nFollowing the massacre, trials were conducted to hold perpetrators accountable. In one case, ten individuals faced charges including torture and murder at the Yarmouk Detention Camp. Another case involved defendants associated with the operation of the makeshift prison. Sergeant-Major Hamza Mabrouk El-Harizi faced charges of mass murder in a separate military court proceeding. Survivors and victims' families actively participated in the trials, seeking justice and accountability.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Zalongo or Mount Zalongo is a small bare mountain of Greece with an altitude of 462 meters. It is located north of Preveza, above the village of Kamarina, and belongs to the mountain range of the Kasopaian mountains of Epirus. The heavily grazed area includes a limited forest zone, steep cliffs and arable land. The area below the historical monument has been reforested with trachea pines (Pinus brutia) while scattered individuals of mossy oak also grow (Quercus pubescens) cypress tree (Cupressus sempervirens) and macroscale oak (Quercus macrolepis). Regarding the herbaceous flora, two endemic species of Greece have been mentioned (Galium advenum) and the Balkan (Saxifraga rotundifolia) flora respectively.\nThe name of the mountain was associated with the pre-revolutionary period of 1821 and in particular with the legendary \"\"Dance of Zalongo \" when a group of Souliotisses and Souliots with their children decided to die free rather than fall into the hands of the Turco-Albanian. At the western end of the Zalongou mountain plateau, the largest statue in Greece was erected during 1950–1961, with the title Monument of Zalongo, designed by the sculptor George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDance of Zalongo\n\n\n== Sources ==\nΜεγάλη Ελληνική Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Δρανδάκη, τ.ΙΑ΄, σ.901.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio Miguel Carmona Sancipriano (born 24 January 1963) is a Spanish former politician. A member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), he served in the Assembly of Madrid (1999–2002; 2011–2015) and the City Council of Madrid (2015–2019), coming third in the 2015 Madrid City Council election when running for mayor of Madrid.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCarmona was raised in the Malasaña neighbourhood of Madrid. A professor of economic sciences, he has taught at Complutense University of Madrid, University of California, Berkeley and Universidad CEU San Pablo. He joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in 1986.\nCarmona was a member of the Assembly of Madrid from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2011 to 2015. On 6 October 2014, he was confirmed as the PSOE candidate for mayor of Madrid in the 2015 Madrid City Council election. Per the party's rules, there were no primaries as no other candidate collected 20% of members endorsing their campaign. His party fell from second to third place, and from 15 to 9 seats. The PSOE added their support to the 20 councillors from second-place Ahora Madrid, installing Manuela Carmena as mayor and ending 24 years of People's Party (PP) rule in the capital. Weeks after the election, Carmona was stripped of spokesmanship of the party group in the City Council of Madrid by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party of the Community of Madrid (PSOE-M) and it was handed to Purificación Causapié, who was second on the electoral list.\nIn March 2018, Carmona said that he would not run in the 2019 Madrid City Council election, but would still be active on the campaign. He became vice president of energy company Iberdrola in October 2021, leaving a year later for executive and communication work in the same corporation.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team is named in honor of the city's famous landmark, the Fontaine des Éléphants\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Éléphants de Chambéry was founded as a low level team in 1972. Much of their early history is unavailable but the team began play in FFHG Division 2 (French 3rd Division) and was at that level in the mid-1980s whenthey were relegated to FFHG Division 3. The team spent almost a decade in the fourth league before winning the league championship in 1995 and earning a promotion back to Division 2. Chambéry spent much of the next 20 years trying to stave off relegation and saved themselves several times. However, the Elephants tempted fate one too many times and lost the relegation series in 2011. Fortunately, the team was saved by financial difficulties for other clubs and they were allowed to remain in Division 2. The near-disaster seemed to rekindle the club and Chambéry swiftly built itself into contender. In 2018, the team won its second championship and earned a promotion to Division 1, where they remain as of 2024.\n\n\n== Season-by-season results ==\n\n\n=== Division 1 ===\n\n\n== Roster ==\n\n\n=== Current roster ===\nAs of April 23, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nElite Prospects\nEurohockey",

The first notable success was the promotion to the Primera Catalana in 2006.\nEven though it seemed that the club would be integrated entirely in the structure of Europa, the collaboration stopped in 2007, coinciding with a relegation. Later, UE Caprabo was absorbed by AE Josep Maria Gené.\nIn 2012–13, CE Europa B was born, a reserve team that formed part of Europa from the beginning. The team started to compete in the Quarta Catalana, the lowest competition possible. In 2022–23, Europa B achieved promotion to the Lliga Elit. In 2023–24, the team achieved promotion to Tercera Federación, achieving the team's entry into Spanish professional football starting with the 2024–25 season.\n\n\n== Season to season ==\n\n\n== Current squad ==\nAs of 22 April 2024\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "content": "\"Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity\" is a scientific article  published by Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) in 1967 in Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences and dedicated to climate modelling. It is often considered to be the most influential paper in history of climate change science: the climate model that it describes is indeed the first one to address the main physical mechanisms that determine the influence of carbon dioxide (CO2) on Earth surface temperature through greenhouse effect.\nManabe and Wetherald one-dimension climate radiative-convective model takes includes an accurate spectroscopy of CO2, ozone and water vapor, atmospheric convection and water vapor feedback. When a doubling CO2 atmospheric concentration is given as input to the model, it gives a temperature shift (equilibrium climate sensitivity) of +2.4 °C, which is consistent with modern estimates, such as those published in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Turbine (\"Vortex\") was an Italian Nembo-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\") in 1902, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was sunk during the latter conflict in May 1915 on the day after Italy entered the war.\n\n\n== Construction, commissioning, and modernization ==\nTurbine was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, on 20 August 1899. She was launched on 21 November 1901 and completed on 28 August 1902. She was commissioned in August 1902. Turbine and the lead ship of her class, Nembo, had their armament modified in 1905, with each having her Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 gun removed and two additional 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes installed, giving them the same armament as that of the following three Nembo-class ships.\nAt various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Turbine′s took place in 1909. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four 356-millimetre (14 in) torpedo tubes replaced by four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) tubes. In 1914–1915 Turbine underwent additonal modifications, receiving equipment that allowed her to lay 10 to 16 mines.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nTurbine participated in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. She was assigned at the time to the 4th Destroyer Squadron along with her sister ships Aquilone, Borea, and Nembo. On 17 April 1912 she suffered damage in a collision with Nembo, but not enough to prevent her from joining Nembo, the armored cruisers Francesco Ferruccio, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Varese, and Vettor Pisani, the torpedo cruiser Coatit, and the torpedo boats Climene, Pegaso, Perseo, and Procione in a bombardment of the Ottoman forts of Gum-Galesch and Sed Ul Bahr in the Dardanelles on 18 April 1912. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Turbine, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Luigi Bianchi, as well as Aquilone, Borea, Nembo, and their sister ship Espero made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto. On the afternoon of 23 May 1915, the day Italy declared war, Turbine and Aquilone got underway to patrol in the Adriatic Sea along the Italian coast as far north as Manfredonia. \nWhile Turbine and Aquilone were on patrol, numerous Austro-Hungarian Navy ships left port during the night of 23–24 May 1915 to carry out previously planned bombardments of military targets and coastal cities along Italy's Adriatic coast. At 04:10 on 24 May Aquilone sighted the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser Helgoland, which was bombarding Barletta. Aquilone steered to attack Helgoland, but soon found herself having the worst of the clash as Helgoland interrupted her bombardment and pursued the smaller and less-heavily armed Aquilone. At around 04:30, Turbine arrived on the scene, having identified Helgoland from a range of 9,000 metres (9,800 yd) and closed at high speed to distract Helgoland both from her pursuit of Aquilone and from her bombardment of Barletta. As Aquilone pulled away, Helgoland shifted fire to Turbine and maneuvered to prevent Turbine from interposing herself between Helgoland and the Italian coast.\nOutgunned by Helgoland, Turbine took advantage of her greater speed to pull away from the Austro-Hungarian cruiser in an attempt to lure her northward in the direction of the Palagruža (known to the Italians as the Pelagosa) archipelago, where Italian warships that could come to Turbine′s assistance were conducting an amphibious landing. The distance between Turbine and Helgoland increased to over 7,000 metres (7,700 yd), although with the first light of dawn Turbine had to turn toward the east to avoid running aground on the promontory of Gargano.\nAt 05:30 Turbine sighted the Austro-Huungarian destroyers Csepel and Tátra — larger, more modern, faster, and better armed than Turbine — off her port bow. As the ships passed Vieste on Gargano, the northbound Turbine was substantially surrounded, with Csepel 5,400 metres (5,900 yd) off her port quarter, Tátra 6,000 metres (6,600 yd) astern, and Helgoland 7,000 metres (7,700 yd) abeam to starboard. The Austro-Hungarian ships opened fire at 05:48, damaging Turbine and wounding some members of her crew, including Bianchi. Turbine returned fire and hit Csepel′s mainmast, wounding some of Csepel′s crew.\nAt 05:50 the ships temporarily ceased fire after sighting another ship to the north-northeast, but they resumed fire at 06:00, when Tátra was about 5,000 metres (5,500 yd) from Turbine and Csepel was 4,600 metres (5,000 yd) away. At 06:10, Turbine′s crew identified the ship sighted at 05:50 as the Austro-Hungarian destroyer Lika, which by then was 6,500 metres (7,100 yd) from Turbine. At 06:30 Lika, which had closed with Turbine to a range of 4,500 metres (4,900 yd), opened fire, quickly scoring two hits, a 66-millimetre (2.6 in) shell which hit Turbine′s forward boiler, causing a violent explosion that damaged her bridge, and shortly after that a 102-millimetre (4 in) shell that hit Turbine′s aft boiler and the starboard side of her wheelhouse. Turbine′s engines shut down, and her inertia carried her only for a short distance before she went dead in the water.\nThe Austro-Hungarian ships closed to a range of 1,000 metres (1,100 yd), then ceased fire and ordered Turbine′s crew to abandon ship. Turbine′s crew began scuttling procedures, then took to the lifeboats. After destroying secret documents, Bianchi remained aboard the sinking Turbine until the chief helmsman took him onto one of the lifeboats at 06:51. Reduced to a riddled and burning wreck, Turbine sank shortly afterwards.\nTurbine′s 53-man crew suffered 10 killed in action. The Austro-Hungarian ships rescued 32 survivors, including Bianchi, and took them as prisoners-of-war. Informed by radio at 06:17 of the clash, the Italian protected cruiser Libia and auxiliary cruiser Città di Siracusa, which were supporting the amphibious landing at the Palagruža archipelago, rushed to the scene and engaged in a brief, indecisive clash with the Austro-Hungarian ships before the Austro-Hungarians withdrew. Libia recovered a sailor who had jumped overboard from an Austro-Huungarian ship to avoid becoming a prisoner, while Città di Siracusa rescued eight men and recovered the bodies of two others. Città di Siracusa transferred the survivors and corpses to Libia. Meanwhile, the Austro-Hungarians transported the Italians they had rescued to Sebenico, where an Italian stoker died of burns he had suffered in Turbine′s sinking.\n\n\n== Crew awards ==\nBianchi received the Silver Medal of Military Valor. The second chief mechanic and two stokers also were decorated \"in memory of\" Turbine. Posthumous Silver Medals of Military Valor went to the stoker who died in Sebenico and one of the men whose bodies Città di Siracusa recovered. The other man whose body Città di Siracusa recovered received a posthumous Bronze Medal of Military Valor.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nOn 24 May 1932, a marble plaque commemorating Turbine was placed at the entrance of the ravelin of Castle of Barletta on the 17th anniversary of her loss. It reads:\n\nAt dawn on 24 May 1915, the Austrian battleship [sic] Helgoland rabidly opened fire on defenseless Barletta and struck this castle, glorious over the centuries because of its structure and historical events. To sap the perfidious enemy, the Turbine sacrificed herself in an unequal struggle, pointing the Italians to the path of glory. Placed in memory by the city. XXIV May MCMXXXII XI E.F.\nAnother plaque commemorating Turbine was placed in Manfredonia.\nOn 24 May 2019, a monument in memory of the men killed in the sinking of Turbine was dedicated in the gardens in front of the Castle of Barletta.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W.

        "content": "Scaralina cristata is a species of planthopper in the family Fulgoridae. It is found from Arizona in the United States south to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is one of four species (the others being Scaralina aethrinsula, Scaralina marmorata, and Scaralina metcalfi) that were, for several decades, erroneously grouped together under a single name, Alphina glauca; this name is now treated as a synonym of S. marmorata.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nScaralina cristata typically occurs at higher elevations, above 1000 meters, and is associated with oaks (Quercus spp.). It has been reared on Quercus arizonica, but this may not be its preferred host species. Adults are readily and commonly attracted to blacklights.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nScaralina cristata is most often found in the Madrean Sky Islands in Arizona down into Sonora, but also with populations of putative conspecifics extending east of the Continental Divide into New Mexico, and south as far as the state of Durango. In Arizona, its range overlaps the ranges of Scaralina aethrinsula and Scaralina metcalfi, and all three species can be found together.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On April 17, 2024, a series of pro-Palestinian Israel–Hamas war protests began in the United States. They emerged in response to the New York City Police Department entering the Columbia University students' encampment to conduct mass arrests during a pro-Palestinian campus occupation, where protesters sought for the university to divest from Israel.  The varying demands from the different protests include severing financial ties with Israel and its affiliated entities, transparency over financial ties, as well as amnesty for protesters.\nDemonstrations spread on April 22, when students at several universities on the East Coast—including New York University, Yale University, Emerson College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Tufts University—began occupying campuses, as well as experiencing mass arrests in New York and at Yale. Protests began emerging throughout the United States in the following days, with protest camps established on over 40 campuses. In response, police departments have detained students and university administrators have suspended students. On April 25 further mass arrests occurred at Emerson College, the University of Southern California and the University of Texas, as protests spread to Europe, Australia and Canada. Over 900 protesters have been arrested, after a continued crackdown on April 27 led to approximately 275 arrests at Washington, Northeastern, Arizona State and Indiana University. Several professors were among those detained at Emory University in Atlanta, and at Washington University in St. Louis, university employees were also arrested. On April 28, counter-protests were held at MIT, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe occupations have resulted in the closure of Columbia University and the Cal Poly Humboldt for the remainder of the semester; votes of no confidence initiated by faculty members in California, Georgia and Texas; and Portland State University pausing its financial ties with Boeing over Boeing's ties with Israel. The protests have otherwise faced criticism from President Joe Biden; U.S. governors Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, and Josh Shapiro; as well as condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — all of whom have described them as antisemitic. The police response to the protests has also faced criticism from U.S. representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Texas Democrats, with the protests otherwise supported by Jewish senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nProtests, including rallies, demonstrations, campaigns, and vigils, relating to the Israel–Hamas war have occurred nationwide across the United States since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023, occurring alongside other Israel–Hamas war protests around the world. Pro-Palestinian protestors criticized US military and diplomatic support to Israel and Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip and its war conduct, which some called a genocide.\nSome of the protests are organized by groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996 as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization, IfNotNow founded during the 2014 Gaza War, and Students for Justice in Palestine, which has over 200 chapters across North America.\n\n\n== Content ==\nMany of the protests are based around students demanding that their schools sever financial ties to Israel and companies involved in the conflict, as well as an end for the US military support to Israel, as part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Some protests have also demanded that the universities sever academic ties with Israel, support a ceasefire in Gaza and disclose investments. Demands from students have also varied among the different occupations, including for universities to stop accepting research money from Israel that supports the military, and the end to college endowments being invested with managers who profit from Israeli entities.\nAfter several mass arrests, the demands have also included amnesty for students and faculty members that were disciplined or fired for protesting. The protests on many of the campuses are created by coalitions of student groups, and largely are independent, but some have claimed that they were inspired by other campus protests, and all have disavowed violence.\nParticipants are students and faculty of various backgrounds with both Jews and Muslims participating in the protests, which have hosted teach-ins, interfaith prayer and musical performances. Some protests invited individuals to tour or speak at the protests such as Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza who was invited and visited the Columbia protests. Some who have participated have also raised concerns about treatment on campus for Palestinian students, with one anonymous student  at University of Pennsylvania, claiming that their administration had created a hostile environment for Palestinian students while attempting to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students.\nThe protests have been compared to the protests of 1968 amid opposition to the Vietnam War due to the scale of the protests as well as the tactics. The Guardian described the protests as \"perhaps the most significant student movement since the anti-Vietnam campus protests of the late 1960s\". According to The Independent, protesters studied the historical movement, while an undergrad student from Columbia commented that student organisers learnt from the experiences of older generations, describing the movement as \"completely built\" on the legacy of the 1968 protests.\n\n\n== Columbia University ==\n\n\n== Spread to other universities ==\n\n\n=== Arizona ===\nOn April 25, dozens gathered to protest on the Old Main lawn at Arizona State University in Tempe. Campus police announced several people were arrested \"for setting up unauthorized encampment, in violation of university policy and the ABOR Student Code of Conduct.\" The same day, a protest was held at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\nOn April 27, the Arizona State University Police Department arrested 69 protesters after the unauthorised encampment was established on campus.\n\n\n=== California ===\n\nThe Cal Poly Humboldt campus in Northern California was shut down by officials on April 22 after students occupied a university building and barricaded its entrance. On April 26, the university closed the campus for the remainder of the semester with classes conducted remotely due to the occupation.\nStudent protesters put up more than a dozen tents on Sproul Plaza at University of California, Berkeley, stating they would remain until the university divested from companies involved with the war. University officials pledged to remove protesters who put up tents or \"disrupted academic activity\" by force. \nThe University of Southern California (USC) canceled a pro-Palestinian student's valedictorian speech citing a need to \"maintain campus safety and security\" after pro-Israel groups accused her of antisemitism. Some student organizations, including the editorial team of USC's student newspaper, criticized the choice to cancel the speech. The decision was followed by protests, with students attempting to establish an encampment. About 93 people were arrested during the night of April 24 including one arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, with no reports of injuries. USC later canceled many of its speakers for commencement before canceling the commencement altogether, citing safety concerns.\nOn April 25, protests spread to multiple Californian universities. The University of California, Los Angeles chapter of SJP set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" between Powell Library and Royce Hall. Social media posts announcing the encampment directly referenced the arrests at USC, and aerial footage showed about 20 tents and a few hundred protesters. On April 28, clashes occurred between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protesters as Stand With Us rallied on the campus, in a protest organised by the Israeli American Council.\nElsewhere, hundreds of people occupied an administration building at UC Santa Barbara on April 25; tents were set up inside the building but no occupation was planned, according to an organizer, and no police were present. A protest march was held at the University of California, Irvine. An encampment was set up at Stanford University. The following day, tents went up at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park for an encampment organized by SJP. Other encampments were set up at California State University, Sacramento and the University of California, Riverside on April 29.\nOn April 27, three demonstrations were held at three of the Claremont Colleges in Claremont, California during alumni events at the schools. At 10:00 a.m., around 36 protesters disrupted a speech by Harvey Mudd College president Harriet Nembhard. At 3:15 p.m., around 50 protesters formed a blockade during a parade at Pomona College. About half an hour later, an encampment was set up at Pitzer College during a music and food festival.\n\n\n=== Colorado ===\nOn April 22, a Colorado State University event with Senator Michael Bennet and former Senator Cory Gardner, moderated by university president Amy Parsons, was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.\nProtesters from the University of Colorado Denver and Metropolitan State University set up an encampment at the Trivoli Quad in the Auraria Campus, an educational facility used by both colleges. Police detained several protesters.\n\n\n=== Connecticut ===\nOn April 12, at Yale University, ahead of the university's Bulldog Days, when admitted freshmen would be visiting, a group of graduate students conducted a hunger strike to call attention to the university's investment in weapons manufacturers profiting off of the war in Gaza. Students supporting those striking grew daily until reaching critical mass after the events at Columbia University. Students at Yale University set up an encampment where sixty pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on April 22 on charges of trespassing. Yale administrators claimed that arrests were because students failed to leave after a warning that the protest posed \"a safety violation\".\nOn April 25, an encampment was launched at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. One person was arrested. Three days later another encampment was set up at Wesleyan University in Middletown.\n\n\n=== Florida ===\nOn April 24, a protest organized by the \"UF Divestment Coalition\" took place at the Plaza of the Americas at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Another protest was held at the University of Central Florida two days later on April 26.A planned encampment on Landis Green at Florida State University lasted only a few minutes on April 25 before being disbanded by university police and the use of sprinklers by school administration.\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nStudents at the Georgia Institute of Technology held a pro-Palestine rally on April 24. The next day, students at Kennesaw State University participated in a walkout.\nOn the morning of April 25, police arrested demonstrators at an encampment at Emory University. Students had established the encampment that morning in solidarity with the people of Gaza as well as in protest of Cop City. Georgia State Patrol, Atlanta Police and University Police began clearing the encampment within three hours of its establishment. Tasers on restrained students and tear gas were used to arrest at least 20 students. Caroline Fohlin, the chair of Emory's philosophy department, was one of the arrested. A video of police using a taser on a restrained protester at Emory went viral, however the vice president from public safety Cheryl Elliott claimed that the individual did not appear to be associated with Emory. Elliot also sent an email to the Emory community, claiming that \"chemical irritants\" were necessary for crowd control due to reported direct assault of officers.\nOn April 29, police arrested 16 people at an encampment set up at the University of Georgia.\n\n\n=== Illinois ===\nOn April 22, students at Loyola University in Chicago held a protest. \nHundreds of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students rallied on April 24 to demand the university divest from BlackRock. On April 26, the University announced that the group had 30 minutes to remove their tents. After 45 minutes, one person who was not a student was arrested for interfering with University staff's attempt to take the tents down.\nOn April 25, students at Northwestern University established an encampment on the south campus of the school's Evanston campus. Several dozen students started the encampment; and the crowd grew to over a thousand by Thursday evening. In response to the protests, the university declared an interim addendum to the student code of conduct prohibiting tents from being erected on campus.\nOn April 26, students at the University of Chicago held a protest march and called for the universities to cut ties with Israel.\n\n\n=== Indiana ===\n\nOn April 19 demonstrators at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis marched on Monument Circle in response to the government's response to the war. \nOn April 25, US Senator Todd Young was being interviewed by Purdue University president Mung Chiang on campus when the event was interrupted by demonstrators. Organizers with SJP and Young Democratic Socialists of America quickly set up an encampment. The chief of the Purdue Police claimed the students were not allowed to have tents, but later, a University spokesman claimed that students were allowed to have tents.\nAt Indiana University, police arrested 33 protesters after an encampment was set up on the Dunn Meadow lawn. The \"IU Divestment Coalition\" made demands including the resignation of the President of the University, the Provost and the Vice-Provost, the end of the institution's collaboration with Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, a naval installation close to Bloomington, and the cutting of financial ties with Israel. The latter would be in violation of a state law blacklisting companies that adhere to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS). On April 25, images circulating on social media appeared to show a police sniper posted on the roof of the Indiana Memorial Union, overlooking the encampment on Dunn Meadow.\n\n\n=== Louisiana ===\nA walkout took place at Tulane and Loyola University in New Orleans on April 26. St. Charles Avenue was closed due to the march. Students demanded that both Universities divest from companies profiting from Israel's war. A pro-Palestinian protest was also held outside of the Louisiana State University student union. The following day, 10 people were arrested at a protest involving Loyola and Tulane University students where, according to the New Orleans Police Department, four officers were injured while clearing Jackson Square of protesters.\n\n\n=== Maryland ===\nA sit-in organized by SJP took place at University of Maryland in College Park on April 23.

A solidarity encampment with at least a dozen tents also appeared at Tufts University.\nOn the evening of April 21, 2024, students at Emerson College set up an encampment in the Boylston Place alleyway in solidarity with those arrested in similar protests. The students called for Emerson to divest from any associations with Zionist ties. During the night of April 24, about 108 people were arrested at the protest with video showing officers forcefully moving through the crowd and throwing protestors on the ground, who had linked arms and used umbrella's to resist. Four officers were reportedly injured with non-life threatening injuries. School administrators stated that the protestors had been warned to leave before hand as the alleyway was not solely owned by the school and that city authorities had threatened to become involved.\nOn April 25, students at Boston's Northeastern University circled their encampment on the school's Centennial Commons and chanted as police approached. Police left the scene shortly afterward. On April 27, more than 100 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested at the university. School officials alleged the student demonstration was infiltrated by outsiders who yelled antisemitic slurs such as \"Kill the Jews.\" A video circulating on social media later showed a counter-protestor holding an Israeli flag had attempted to provoke a response by yelling \"kill the Jews.\"\nDemonstrators at the University of Massachusetts Amherst protested the inauguration of UMass Amherst Chancellor Javier Reyes, calling on him to cut ties with military groups and drop charges against people who had been charged during previous protests at UMass Amherst. The same day, a protest was held at Boston College. During the protest, an organizer read a letter written by a BC student who had been arrested at Emerson and banned from the BC campus.\n\n\n=== Michigan ===\nAbout 25 tents were spotted near the Hatcher Graduate Library at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

After 29 hours the protesters moved to an encampment on the lawn in front of the building.\n\n\n=== New Hampshire ===\nAround 200 people demonstrated at Dartmouth College's campus on April 25. Another protest was held at the University of New Hampshire on the same day, where demonstrators called for UNH to divest from companies based in Israel.\n\n\n=== New York ===\nPolice broke down tents outside the Stern School of Business at New York University on April 22. 133 protesters were arrested. Helga Tawil-Souri, a professor at NYU, stated, \"They brought in the police – hundreds of policemen in riot gear\". Solidarity sit-ins were also held at NYU's campuses in Berlin, Germany and Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nAuthorities at NYU have alleged that some participants involved in the protests were without links to the university, and the head of Columbia alleged that tensions on campus were being exploited and increased by individuals not affiliated with the university had joined the protests.\nOn April 22, 2024, Cornell University undergraduates supported, by a 2–1 margin, a referendum calling for a permanent ceasefire and for divestment from weapons manufacturers supporting Israel.

        "content": "Loom is the upcoming sixth studio album by American pop rock band Imagine Dragons, set to be released through Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on June 28, 2024. The standard version of the record will consist of nine tracks, their least to date. Produced by the band and longtime collaborators Mattman & Robin, it follows their two-part studio album Mercury – Acts 1 & 2 (2022).\n\n\n== Background and concept ==\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Dan Reynolds described the creative process behind the album and its cover:\n\n You can't really tell if it's a sunset or a sunrise, and then there are two people kind of separated standing in front of it. That really kind of sums it up thematically when I listen to it, Is the beginning of something new, or is this the end of something? And the sunset and the sunrise always kind of feels that way to me. It could be either/or.\n\n\n== Singles and promotion ==\nOn March 10, 2024, the band began teasing new music on their social media. In the following days, a sand clock was displayed on the official website. By the end of March, the website started showing four doors. The four doors consisted on three different groups competing to get points on multiple mini games; the three groups were Croyants (Believers), Guerriers (Warriors) and Rêveurs (Dreamers), divided according to previous music preference of the users. Each of these groups were referencing a song from a previous album.\nEach week, a new door was revealed, showing a new game and some clues about the release date or some of the new songs' lyrics. On April 1, with the opening of the second door, they announced a new song titled \"Eyes Closed\" would be released on April 3. On April 22, after all four doors were opened, a fifth door –referencing the \"Eyes Closed\" music video– was revealed, which finally confirmed the new album's name to be Loom. Additionally, a new world tour was announced to begin during the summer.\nFor the winning team of the four doors, the Croyants, a video was shared with snippets for three songs from the new album, titled: \"Fire in These Hills\", \"Nice to Meet You\" and \"Wake Up\".\nOn April 25, a post on social media from the band's official accounts teased a new collaboration.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nKnown track titles include; \"Fire in These Hills\", \"Nice to Meet Ya\", \"Just Yet\", \"Take Me to the Beach\", \"In Your Corner\", \"Don't Forget Me\" and \"Kid\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Renowned observer and author Stephen James O’Meara described it as a “hidden treasure”.  \n\n\n== Morphology ==\nTwo fully compatible distances are indicated in the SIMBAD database: 1.665 ± 0.333 kpc (∼5430 ly)6 and approximately 1646 pc (∼5370 ly). Two identical speed values are also indicated on SIMBAD, −31.0 ± 5.0 km/s. The apparent size of the nebula is 0.8'3 or 0.79'4 (0.795 ± 0.005'), which, taking into account the distance calculations, equates to an actual size of 1, 26 ± 0.26 al. Observations show the expanding CO shell is pretty much continuously distributed around the minor axis waist and the nebula is tilted to the plane of the sky. The shell is also fragmented into a series of condensations.  \n\n\n== Central star ==\nThe visual magnitude of the central star is 17.49 and its mass is estimated at 2.932 solar masses. Its surface temperature reaches 123 k K and its luminosity is equal to 69 times that of the Sun. The radius of the nebula is estimated at 0.122 pc and its age is equal to 6,350 years.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of planetary nebulae\nList of NGC objects (6001–7000)\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 6563 at SIMBAD\nNGC 6563 at LEDA\nNGC 6563 at NASA/IPAC\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adam Sonn (born February 8, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for the Lipscomb Bisons and Belmont Bruins. Sonn was selected as the Atlantic Sun Player of the Year with the Bruins in 2003. He played professionally in Belgium, France, South Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. Sonn became a high school basketball coach after his retirement from playing.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSonn was raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and attended Donelson Christian Academy. He was selected as Class A Tennessee Mr. Basketball by the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association in 1998.\nSonn committed to play for the Lipscomb Bisons because his family had connections to Lipscomb University through their Churches of Christ affiliation. His mother and two of his aunts attended the university and his uncle, Steve Flatt, served as its president.\n\n\n== College career ==\nSonn played one season for the Bisons under head coach Don Meyer. In 1999, Flatt decided to move the Lipscomb athletic programs from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) to the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I. Meyer left Lipscomb in protest and Sonn decided to transfer. He chose to join the Belmont Bruins over the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles.\nWith the Bruins, Sonn was a two-time All-Atlantic Sun first-team selection and named as the Atlantic Sun Player of the Year in 2003. He scored a total of 1,241 points and is among the Bruins' all-time leading rebounders. Sonn set a Bruins record for most rebounds in a Division I game when he grabbed 21 on January 17, 2002.\nSonn was inducted into the Belmont University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nSonn played professionally in Belgium, France, South Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain.\nSonn played for the Nashville Rhythm of the American Basketball Association (ABA) during the 2004–05 season. He publicly advocated for his coach, Ashley McElhiney, to keep her job after she was fired during a game.\n\n\n== Post-playing career ==\nSonn coached at Nashville Christian School from 2008 to 2012.\nIn 2012, Sonn was appointed as head coach of the boys' varsity basketball team at Goodpasture Christian School in Madison, Tennessee. He led the team to seven Division II-A state tournament appearances and won the Division II-AA state title in 2021.\nOn May 17, 2023, Goodpasture Christian School announced that Sonn was leaving his coaching position to become the school's director of advancement.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSonn's younger brother, Jason, also played basketball for the Belmont Bruins.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCollege statistics",

        "content": "Juan Perea Capulino (1890–1967) was a prominent Spanish soldier, who participated in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Originally a private, he became a General and commanded the Eastern Army in the final phase of the war, an action for which he is most remembered.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, he joined the army at 16 as a private. At the age of 27 he became a lieutenant. He fought during the Rif War in Morocco, where he spent 15 years. Seriously injured, he requested to be transferred to the continent. He participated in the failed 1926 Sanjuanada plot to overthrow the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera and was sentenced to six years in prison in Montjuïc Castle. Released in 1932, he retired from the army with the rank of captain.\nAfter the Spanish coup of July 1936, he returned to service to defend the Second Spanish Republic. His first action took place in the Sierra de Guadarrama. In September, he fought at Lozoya where the losses on both sides were very high. He was promoted to Commander on 6 August 1936.\nOn 6 December 1936, he supported the troops of José María Galán in the Pozuelo de Alarcón sector. He did not participate in the Second Battle of the Corunna Road (13-19 December) because the XI International Brigade supported all attacks at Boadilla del Monte. On 31 December, he was appointed leader of the 5th Division, which defended the road to La Coruña, north of Madrid. The 5th Division took part in the Third Battle of the Corunna Road (2–16 January 1937), containing the enemy troops advancing towards Madrid, with heavy losses. In April 1936 he commanded the IV Corps until October 1937.\nOn 23 October 1937 he participated in the Battle of Teruel. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel for his brilliant performance at the head of the XXI Corps in the midst of the Republican disaster in Aragon.\nOn 30 March 1938 he left the leadership of the XXI Corps, to replace Sebastián Pozas Perea at the head of the Eastern Army , which was completely disorganized and in full disarray. He could not avoid losing Lérida in early April, but he put an end to the Nationalist offensive towards the Noguera Pallaresa river.\nWhen the Nationalist Offensive against Catalonia was unleashed in December 1938, the units of his Army of the East showed great cohesion, but they finally had to give up their positions and undertake the withdrawal towards the north. On 15 January 1939, he was promoted to Colonel, and crossed the French border at the beginning of February with the remains of his troops and thousands of fleeing civilians.\nAfter the end of the civil war he went into exile in Mexico in 1942, where he participated in anti-Franco organizations, trying to  keep the spirit of the Republic alive. Promoted to General, he died of a heart attack in 1967, when he was in Algeria.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nTHOMAS, Hugh, Historia de la Guerra Civil Española. Círculo de Lectores, Barcelona, 1976.

Very few studies have been carried out on NGC 6742 and the identification of the central star of the nebula by the Kepler Space Telescope is uncertain.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nTwo distances are indicated in the SIMBAD astronomical database: 5,150 ± 1,030 kpc (∼16,800 ly) and approximately 5,091 pc (∼16,600 ly). Its apparent size is 0.55′3. No data is available for its speed.\n\n\n== Observation ==\nNGC 6742 has a magnitude of 13.4, meaning that its surface brightness is high enough to be seen with a 25 cm diameter telescope. It appears as a round disk measuring 30\"6.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of nebulae\nList of planetary nebulae\nList of NGC objects (6001–7000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 6742 at SIMBAD",

        "content": "Monte Walsh is a Western novel written by Jack Schaefer and published on January 1, 1963. It was loosely adapted into a movie in 1970 and a television series in 2003.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMonte Walsh has never met a horse he couldn't ride, and Chet Rollins has never met one he couldn't rope. For a decade they are unbeatable and inseparable, working as trail hands throughout the West until finally settling with Cal Brennan's Slash Y. Their rough cowboy ethics see them through every imaginable challenge: blizzards, rustlers, outlaws, and card games gone wrong. Partial to pretty women, gambling, and practical jokes, Monte is often on the receiving end of trouble, while Chet is always there to break him out of jail or serve as a decoy until Monte can get out of town in a hurry.\nAs the West begins to change, however—the automobile replacing the horse, the herds breaking up—the two friends part ways. Chet marries and goes on to become a successful merchant, banker, and politician; but Monte, unable to imagine anything but the cowboy's way of life, refuses to the end to leave the range.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReview on the book during its release has been largely positive. Author Steve Hockensmith praised it, stating, \"Jack Schaefer is mostly remembered for one of his other (very fine) novels: Shane, the basis for the iconic film. But it’s the lesser-known Monte Walsh that really captures what life was like in the waning days of the “Wild West,” especially for cowboys. The episodic novel follows the titular wrangler over the entirety of his life as he wanders the West looking for work and getting into and out of trouble. Like Lonesome Dove, it gives readers a look at cowboy life so up-close-and-personal you can practically smell the smoke from the campfire.\"\nGeorge Pelecanos also commented kindly of the book, stating, \"Essentially, the book is about living one’s life by a certain code and the pleasure to be found in work. Most notably, it is a definitive novel of male friendship, particularly the friendship of Monte and Chet Rollins, and their relationship to the other men of the Slash Y. Be warned that not much “happens” in this novel in terms of the usual genre conventions, and some might find it slow. But the book is deliberately paced to reflect the rhythm of these men's lives, and eventually the style invites you in. Beautifully written, carefully researched and described, this is a character study that resonates.\"\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nMonte Walsh was loosely adapted into the 1970 film of the same name starring Lee Marvin, Jeanne Moreau, and Jack Palance, and again as a 2003 television film starring Tom Selleck.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is currently based in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOdisho was born in the village of Berseveh near Zakho, Iraq in 1984 as the daughter of Odisho Moshe, who is another singer-songwriter. From a young age, Odisho fell in love with music after getting the opportunity to sing with her father on stage. Leaving Iraq to avoid persecution, she stayed in Turkey before immigrating to Sweden, where a large portion of the Assyrian diaspora reside. After her marriage, she left for Australia.\nOdisho's first feature was in 2006, when she sang on a song for her father's album, titled Bayanneh. In 2009, she released her first album, O Yala d Bayane, which began her full-time music career. Odisho has since become one of the most well-known Assyrian celebrities today, with continuous performances at weddings, celebrations, and other festivities to commemorate Assyrian culture and history. Odisho hopes to produce songs that help Assyrians preserve the Syriac language from extinction.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2009 - O Yala d Bayane\n2012 - Bzamran Beyokh\n2018 - Len Msaya d Manshanokh\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2022 - Bayanokh Babi (ft.

The triplet has been included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 313. Both NGC 3995 and NGC 3991 have a disturbed appearance while NGC 3994 doesn't. The triplet is part of the NGC 3966 Group or LGG 259. Other members include NGC 3966, NGC 3935, NGC 3986, IC 2973, UGC 6892, IC 2978, and IC 2979.\nThe nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active, and based on its spectral lines it is a composite object with LINER and HII region characteristics. The nucleus lacks central ultraviolet emission when observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. Star formation knots are visible along the spiral arms, most of them with ages less than 20 million years, with no correlation between location and age. The star formation rate of NGC 3995 is estimated to be 2.9±0.6 M☉ per year, with higher rates observed near the centre of the galaxy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3994 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

Woodhull (July 24, 1842 – March 25, 1926) was an American physician and medical missionary who ran a hospital in Fuzhou, China, from 1884 to 1912. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWoodhull was born in Wading River, New York, the daughter of Noah Hallock Woodhull and Hannah Conklin Woodhull.  She earned her medical degree from the New York Medical College for Women in 1873, with further studies in Zürich and Dresden.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWoodhull taught school as a young woman. She practiced medicine in Smyrna, Delaware, and was house physician at a foundling hospital in Chicago. She sailed for China as a medical missionary in 1884. She trained Chinese women physicians and treated patients at a Christian mission in Foochow (Fuzhou) for 28 years. Her younger sister Hannah C. Woodhull was also a missionary, as a teacher at Foochow. \nWoodhull founded and ran a hospital for women and children at Foochow. \"New paint and fresh whitewash will not heal disease,\" she wrote to colleagues in 1895 of her policies, \"but it makes a good impression on the heathen if the hospital has a thrifty appearance.\" Both sisters retired from mission work and returned to the United States in 1912. She was succeeded as head of the hospital by Lora G. Dyer. She spoke to American church and women's groups about her experiences in China, and at the Woman's Board of Foreign Missions meeting in Boston in 1893.\nThe Woodhull sisters had a furlough in the United States in 1896 and 1897. They were \"ardent advocates of enfranchising women\" and both lived to vote in Suffolk County in 1918.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"Foochow\" (1895)\n\"A Plea for Hygiene\" (1901)\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nWoodhull died in 1926, at the age of 83, in Riverhead, New York. The Kate C. Woodhull Hospital for Women was dedicated in 1925, to mark the 40th anniversary of her arrival in China. \n\n\n== References ==",

The club was founded in 1937 and currently plays in the Segunda División, the second division of football in Uruguay.\n\n\n== History ==\nC.S.D Cooper was founded on 25 August 1937, but ceased football operations in 1980. The club re-established its football side in 2021 as a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva, joining the Divisional D. That year, the club signed a number of high-profile players including Mauro Vila and Jorge Zambrana en route to an undefeated season and the league championship. However, no promotion or relegation took place that season. In June 2022, the club faced Tacuarembó F.C. in the opening match of the 2022 Copa Uruguay, the first-ever match of the new tournament. The club won the Divisional D again the following season, defeating Club Atlético Lito 4–1 and earning promotion to the Primera División Amateur in 2023. In 2023, the club was runner-up in the third tier, behind only Colón. Cooper earned its second-straight promotion, reaching a professional level for the first time in its history, by qualifying for the Segunda División in 2024.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nDivisional D (2)\nChampions: 2021, 2022\nSegunda División Amateur\nRunner-up: 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUruguayan Football Association profile\nSoccerway profile\nGlobal Sports Archive profile",

        "content": "Caritas Ukraine (Ukrainian: Карітас України) is a Ukrainian Catholic not-for-profit and humanitarian relief organisation. \nCaritas Ukraine is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis. Within Ukraine, it is one of two national Caritas organisations, alongside Caritas-Spes. The distinction between the two lies in their founding initiatives: Caritas Ukraine was initiated by the Greek Catholic bishops, whereas Caritas-Spes was initiated by the Roman Catholic bishops.\n\n\n== Work ==\nCaritas Ukraine is dedicated to advancing traditions of charitable activities and social work across various sectors. Since its inception, it has focused on supporting vulnerable populations. These areas of work include assistance to children, youth, families facing crisis situations, people with special needs; as well as health care, social migration issues, and community building. Emergency assistance is currently the most important sector for the organisation.\nBetween the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Caritas Ukraine quickly scaled up its activities. Until 2017, the organisation established 12 new offices and hired 600 new staff. Until 2022, Caritas Ukraine helped more than 800,000 people. In the two years after the 2022 invasion and the subsequent explosion of humanitarian needs, the organisation helped more than three million people in the country, making it one of the largest humanitarian actors in Ukraine.\nHumanitarian support is provided through a variety of programmes, including the distribution of food kits, hygiene products and medicines, cash grants, assistance in creating or restoring individual businesses or agricultural activities, repair of damaged houses, psychological and legal support.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCaritas Ukraine works with more than 1,000 employees and volunteers in 40 regional organisations across 20 regions of Ukraine.\nThe organisation has two national coordination offices, in Lviv and in Kyiv.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nCaritas of Ukraine won awards at the National Charity Ukraine competition in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. In 2019, the organisation was one of the winners of the first edition of the Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko Award.\nIn 2023, Caritas Ukraine's President Tetiana Stawnychy was awarded the Prix Caritas from Caritas Switzerland for the vital humanitarian aid her organisation has been providing following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (in Ukrainian)",

        "content": "William \"Wee Willie\" Allan (January 11, 1930 – April 1, 2019) was an American Dirt Modified racing driver.  Always detectable on the track by flying a villainous skull and bones flag, and readily identifiable off the track because of his diminutive size, he was a favorite of the younger race fans.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\"Wee Willie\" started racing in 1953 at the Hemlock Speedway in the Finger Lakes region of New York.  He focused his efforts on Central New York, including the Maple Grove Speedway in Waterloo, the Syracuse Mile, and claimed the 1964 track championship at Weedsport Speedway.  Allan was also successful on his occasional trips to special events, including Lebanon Valley Speedway NY.\nAllan began winding down his racing by switching to the dirt late model class, and then retired in 1979. He continued his involvement in the sport for another decade as the official pace car driver for the Super DIRTcar Series, and was inducted into the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dimple Thapa is a People's Democratic Party politician and minister from Bhutan. She trained in forestry before she was elected to the National Assembly. In 2024 she became the only woman in Tshering Tobgay's cabinet and the minister for Minister of Education and Skills Development.\n\n\n== Life ==\nThapa comes from the far western part of Bhutan in the Yoeseltse Gewog. She studied for her first degree at the Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in India and she then took a master's degree, again in forestry, at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, Austria. She has co-authored a number of papers dealing with the wildlife of Bhutan. In 2010 she published a paper on bio-diversity conservation in Nepal.\nShe had joined the civil service as a Forestry Officer in 2005 and she rose to be Chief Forestry Officer looking after the Tsirang's Territorial Divisional Office within the Department of Forests and Park Services.\nFrom November 2023 to January 2024 the national elections took place to elect new members of the 47 seat National Assembly. Thapa was the only woman in her party and one of only two women elected to the assembly. This was the lowest number of women elected since the start of democratic elections in 2008. Only six women were candidates in the final round and only Thapa and Dorji Wangmo were elected. Dorji Choden, who had been the country's first woman minister, lost her seat to a man despite her experience. It is speculated that rural voters see politics as a job for a man, although at a local level candidates others have followed Namgay Peldon's 2008 example and they have been elected. In this election there were over 300,000 voters and the men were outnumbered by women voters.\nIn 2024 she was the only woman elected in the winning party and she became the only woman in Tshering Tobgay's ten-person cabinet. She became the Minister of Education and Skills Development.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3995 is a Magellanic spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 100 million light years away from Earth based on the Tully–Fisher relation, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3995 is approximately 80,000 light years across, while based on redshift it lies 170 million light years away. It was discovered by Heinrich d'Arrest on February 5, 1864.\nNGC 3995 forms a triplet of galaxies with NGC 3994, which lies 1.9 arcminutes, and NGC 3991, which lies 3.7 arcminutes away. The triplet has been included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 313. Both NGC 3995 and NGC 3991 have disturbed appearances while NGC 3994 doesn't. The triplet is part of the NGC 3966 Group or LGG 259. Other members include NGC 3966, NGC 3935, NGC 3986, IC 2973, UGC 6892, IC 2978, and IC 2979.\nThe star formation rate of NGC 3995 is estimated to be 4.2±0.9 M☉ per year, with higher rates observed near the centre of the galaxy. The nucleus of the galaxy has emission that resembles an HII region. The spectrum of the galaxy has Wolf-Rayet features, indicative of recent star formation. Hubble Space Telescope detected 46 star formation knots in the galaxy, most of them having ages less than 20 million years.\nTwo supernovae have been observed in NGC 3995, SN 1988ac and SN 2000ez, a type II supernova.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 3995 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Por cesárea (transl. Caesarean section) is the second studio album by Argentine singer, rapper and record producer Dillom. It was released on 26 April 2024 and includes collaborations with Andrés Calamaro and Lali.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nDillom released his debut studio album Post Mortem on 1 December 2021 to critical acclaim. He later embarked on the Post Mortem Tour across Latin America and Spain, including gigs at Lollapalooza, Cosquín Rock and Primavera Sound, as well as headlining sets at Movistar Arena, Luna Park and Teatro Vorterix. While on tour and working on his second album, Dillom collaborated with pop duo Miranda!, rapper and singer Wos and released \"Ola de suicidios\", a post-punk number that caused controversy for its lyrical content. He also surprise-released the Ad honorem, Vol. 1 EP, which included collaborations with Il Quentín and Mechayrxmeo.\nOn 22 April 2024, Dillom announced on social media the title and release date of his second studio album Por cesárea. He began working on the album during the Post Mortem Tour in Barcelona as a \"script\" from which the songs would later develop. Back in Argentina, he reunited with Fermín Ugarte and Luis Tomás Lamadrid at Delta Sound Lodge in the city of Tigre and took \"a year and a half\" to complete the album.\nPor cesárea was finally released on 26 April 2024.\n\n\n== Lyrics and music ==\nPor cesárea is a \"cinematic\" concept album about \"the tortuous mental deterioration of a young man,\" dealing with themes such as violence, obsession, drug abuse and trauma. It was described as a \"psychological thriller soundtrack\" and \"rock opera\", compared to Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979) and Charly García's La hija de la lágrima (1994) due to its \"homogenous\" storytelling and structure. Musically, Por cesárea is mostly a trip hop album with elements of abstract hip hop, rock and experimental music and was compared to acts such as Pixies, Blur, The Stooges, Bee Gees, Frank Ocean, Tyler, the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, Brockhampton, Nine Inch Nails, Beastie Boys, Nirvana and Soundgarden.\nPor césarea opens with \"Últimamente\", a \"dramatic\" trip hop song that \"bases the concept [of the album]\" and \"narrates the suicide attempt of a mother.\" The following tracks, \"La novia de mi amigo\" and \"Cirugía\" were described as \"twisted love songs.\" \"Cirugía\" displays \"dark and problematic romanticism\" and its lyrics compared to The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\" (1983). Fourth track \"Mi peor enemigo\" features Argentine rock musician Andrés Calamaro and opens with a sampled trumpet solo by Jerry González. \"(Mentiras Piadosas)\" features uncredited vocals by Brooke Carrey and \"functions as an interlude and [sets the tone]\" for the following song, sixth track \"La carie\". It features Argentine pop singer Lali covering the opening lines of \"Plegaria desvelada\" (1976) by author and composer María Elena Walsh, as well as an orchestral outro directed by Alejandro Terán.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPor cesárea was positively received upon release. Giuliana Luchetti from La Voz described the album as \"risky, disruptive and visceral [...] Dillom's magnum opus.\" Writing for Infobae, Ezequiel Ruiz lauded Por cesárea as \"one of the best Argentine [albums] of the century\", while popular radio station FM Rock & Pop 95.9 called it \"a work of art\". Juan Cruz Revello from Data Diario described the project as \"cinematic\" and \"a lyrical and sonorous statement about real-life, contemporary emotional instability.\" Lucas Santomero from Indie Hoy observed \"an overwhelming musical growth\" and described Dillom's \"enfant terrible\" character as \"more sensible, profound and twisted\" in comparison to his debut. El Planteo complimented Dillom as \"a cultural innovator\" and stated that Por cesárea \"explores new musical and narrative dimensions, showcasing palpable growth in his style and artistic focus.\"\n\n\n== Tracklist ==\nAll tracks produced by Fermín Ugarte and Luis Tomás Lamadrid.\n\n\n== References ==",

After gaining an M.Ed., she lectured in Education and Handicraft at the Victoria University of Manchester and wrote and co-authored several books and articles, including her hand-drawn artifact diagrams, on textile collections from Europe, Central America, and Asia.\nIn 1939 she collaborated with Edith Durham on The Durham Collection of Garments and Embroideries from Albania and Yugoslavia, which, according to Taylor, 'remains a model of good practice today.'\n\n\n== Select works ==\n'Coptic Cloths', Bankfield Museum Notes 4 (1914)\n'Burmese Textiles from the Shan and Kachin Districts', Notes from Bankfield Museum 7 (1917)\n(with Alfred C.

The first single was \"Whiskey Trip\". Stewart supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Roy Dea. Stewart wrote the title track and \"Single Again\". \"I Got Mine\" is a cover of the Ry Cooder version of the 1902 song. Josh Graves played dobro on the cover of the Marshall Tucker Band's \"Can't You See\". \"Honky-Tonkin'\" is a cover of the Hank Williams song. The Jordanaires and Linda Hargrove provided backing vocals on the album.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRobert Christgau wrote that Stewart is \"secure by now in his good-humored bad-old-boy persona.\" The Commercial Appeal said that \"Stewart's quavering voice is the type that calls for neon beer signs, cheap checkered tablecloths and either a broken heart or a lusty gleam.\" The Dayton Daily News noted that \"a million-dollar studio can do a lot for a voice.\"\nThe Kansas City Star praised the title track, but opined that \"Stewart needs to decide whether he's going to sound like an honest-to-goodness honky-tonker or whether he's going to drift into the Nashville-sound trap.\" The Boston Globe called Stewart's voice \"a devastating instrument, drenched with emotion and a dual capacity to convey suffering and boiled-up craziness.\" The Citizen deemed Little Junior \"funky, country-blues [with] tough guitars and fat-back drums.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"Stewart's aching warble adds new dimensions to shopworn generalizations, often evoking compassion for decidedly unsympathetic characters.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Concrete Sustainability Council is an industry organization and standards body focused on decreasing the environmental impact of cement, concrete, and aggregate. The group was originally launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development as the Concrete Sustainability Initiative in 2013. The project has been managed by the Global Cement and Concrete Association since 2019.\nThe initiative's initial goal was to establish a certification system for responsibly sourced concrete and its supply chain. The initiative launched the CSC certification system, which is an industry certification that can contribute to LEED certification related to materials. The process evaluates both supply chain and process used for the production of concrete, and other Environmental and Social consequences. Parts of the certificate are optional, such as the CO2 certification -- so not all CSC certified products are low carbon. The certificate is administered by \"regional system operators\" such as German Ready-Mixed Concrete Association in Germany. As of 2021, 485 concrete industry organizations had the certification.\nThe certificate comes in four levels Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze -- with platinum complying with more of the certification requirements. The standards for cement, aggregate and concrete are different.The certification allows designers and architects to better understand the lifecycle and impact of concrete in their construction projects.  Cement plants that are retrofitting or trying to become more sustainable, can use the standard to redesign their processes.\nBeyond certification, the initiative also supports research for the cement industry, such as a technology roadmap of the cement industry with the IEA.\n\n\n== References ==",

Upon marriage to Andrea III Muzaka, Chiranna was granted by her father the territory and title of Lady of Grabossa. She is known for being the founder of the Holy Trinity Church, Lavdar, an important cultural monument in Albania.\n\n\n== Life ==\nChiranna \"Anna\" Zenevisi or Chiranna Sarbissa, (alb. Kirana Zenebishi) was the daughter of John Zenevisi, Serbastokrator of Epirus. Her mother was a daughter of Gjin Boua-Spata and sister of Irene Spata, wife of Esau de' Buondelmonti. From her marriage to Molossachian Despot Andrea III, Chiranna had four children who survived into adulhood: \n\nGjin II, father of John Muzaka.\nMaria Muzaka, wife of Gjergj Arianiti and mother of Donika Kastrioti. Through her, Chiranna was the grandmother in law of Skanderbeg, Albania's national hero.\nTheodore III, who bcame his father's successor and participated in various battles against the Ottomans, eventually co-founding the League of Lezhë. He died without leaving any legitimate heirs and was succeeded by his elder brother Ginno II.\nHelena Muzaka, married Lord Philip of Ragusa.\nIn 1470, Chiranna build the Holy Trinity Church of Tudas, a 1963 declared Cultural Monument of Albania. Her grandson, John Muzaka, in his memoir \"Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi\", describes his family as devout Christians. His father and Chiranna's son, Gjin II, build Saint Mary's Church in Bungë, near the village of Zerec. It was build just a few km from Lavdar, where the Holy Trinity Church is located. He was buried in the eastern side of the Church, whereas his mother and wife, Chiranna Zardari, were buried in the western side, upon their respective deaths.

Israeli settlements are considered illegal by the international community.\nIn late 2022, far-right leaders of the Israeli settlement movement were elected into the government of Israel and appointed as prominent ministers; in early 2023, Israeli settler violence increased, which included the Huwara rampage of February 2023. In October 2023, the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war was accompanied by a further escalation in Israeli settler violence in the West Bank.\n\n\n== Disappearance of Benjamin Achimeir and discovery of his body ==\n\n\n== Resulting settler violence ==\n\nFollowing Achimeir's disappearance, Israeli settler rampages took place in nearby Palestinian villages, which escalated following the discovery of his body. At least four people were killed and dozens of Israelis and Palestinians were wounded. According to the Israeli human rights agency Yesh Din, at least ten villages came under attack.  In response, the IDF deployed extra troops and Border Police to the area.\n\n\n=== Al-Mughayyir ===\n\nOn 12 April, during midday, hundreds of Israeli settlers armed with firearms and stones stormed the village of al-Mughayyir, Ramallah, around 500 metres (1,600 ft) west of the settlement Achimair was last seen. The settlers were participating in the search for the boy. The head of the village council, Amin Abu Alia, estimated that around 1,000 to 1,200 settlers encircled the village, and around 500 entered. The settlers initially blocked the roads in the area, but then began to attack it, raiding homes and starting fires. Shots were also fired at residents, resulting in clashes. A video showed houses and vehicles in the village on fire. Around 25 people were injured in the attack, and 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia was killed. It is unclear if his death was caused by settlers or Israeli soldiers. \nAt least eight of the wounded were struck by gunfire. 70 sheep were also reportedly stolen. At around 3:00 pm, the IDF arrived at the scene. According to Abu Alia, the soldiers did not act to prevent the attacks, and instead allowed settlers to raid homes while preventing Palestinians from moving around and blocking ambulances from reaching the injured. The Palestinian Red Crescent said 11 ambulances were dispatched, and several people were wounded by bullet fragments. According to the IDF, security forces were sent to disperse the riots, and rocks were thrown at soldiers, who then responded with live fire. It added that soldiers worked alongside Israel Border Police to remove Israeli settlers who entered the village.\n\nThe following day, dozens of settlers returned to the village, setting 12 houses and several cars ablaze. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that three people were injured, one critically. Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets against villagers who gathered, in an attempt to disperse them. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said that settlers opened fire at its workers and set one of their cars ablaze.\n\n\n=== Abu Falah ===\nOn 13 April, at least five Palestinians were reportedly wounded after an Israeli settler attack on the village of Abu Falah, close to Ramallah.\n\n\n=== Beitin ===\nIn Beitin, a village near Ramallah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that 17-year-old Omar Hameed died from his wounds hours after being shot by settlers. The Palestinian Red Crescent said that at least 20 others were wounded, and a photographer for the Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, was also assaulted by settlers, some of whom were wearing military costumes.\n\n\n=== Duma ===\nAt least four Palestinians were wounded when Israeli settlers raided the village of Duma. During the raid, several houses and at least 40 cars were set ablaze. Shaul Golan, an Israeli photographer and journalist for Ynet, was beaten by settlers while covering the attack. He suffered a broken hand and his equipment was destroyed. Some of the settlers were masked, while others wore military uniforms. In an interview, Golan said that he begged who he thought were soldiers to help him, but then realized that they were not soldiers and were working with the settlers.\nThe head of the Duma village council, Suleiman Dawabsha, told reporters that around 300 Israeli soldiers stormed the village along with hundreds of settlers. The IDF did not make a statement regarding the claim. A resident of the village whose home was set on fire said that soldiers were present but did not stop the attack. The attack mirrored a similar incident in 2015, when an extremist settler set a house ablaze in the village, killing three and injuring one.\nHaaretz staff went to Duma on 13 April 2024, describing that \"as the riots were still going on, a number of [Israeli] settlers could be seen leaving the village toward the main road where soldiers and Border Police officers were stationed. The settlers then got in their cars and drove off. No law enforcement officer present tried to detain or ask them if they'd been involved in the riots.\"\n\n\n=== Aqraba ===\nAccording to Salah Bani Jaber, the mayor of Aqraba, Nablus, around 50 settlers attacked the town, many of them armed. The settlers assaulted and fired shots at residents, leading to two deaths. Jaber told Reuters that Israeli soldiers were present at the scene, but did not intervene and instead stood by and watched the attack. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the soldiers blocked ambulances from reaching the wounded. According to the IDF, soldiers were dispatched to the area and intervened to halt the clashes.\n\n\n=== Deir Dibwan ===\nCCTV footage showed that in the Palestinian village of Deir Dibwan, a masked Israeli settler entered a garage and set a parked car on fire, while at least three Israeli soldiers, who were guarding the settlers, watched and made no attempt to stop him.\n\n\n=== As-Sawiya ===\nIsraeli settlers arrived at the town of As-Sawiya, close to the Israeli settlement of Eli, and began to throw stones at the Palestinian residents, who did the same in retaliation. IDF soldiers arrived at the scene shortly after the clashes broke out and opened fire at rioters. Haaretz reported that the soldiers only arrived after the settlers were chased out of the town by a group of residents, and that the settlers were standing on a hill alongside the soldiers around 500 metres (1,600 ft) away before they opened fire.\nA volunteer ambulance driver for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society was fatally shot by Israeli settlers while transporting injured Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Some Hebrew-language reports said that he was shot by Israeli armed forces. The IDF confirmed that an ambulance driver was killed and said that it was investigating the incident.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nThe settler attacks in the West Bank were criticized by Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, who called them violent riots and urged Israel to intervene to prevent further violence.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned against revenge attacks in the West Bank, saying that they would make it more difficult for Israeli forces in their mission.\nDahlia Scheindlin of Haaretz in April 2024 contrasted the Israeli reaction to the Huwara rampage in February 2023 to the Israeli reaction to the April 2024 settler attacks - in the earlier event: \"Many Israelis immediately labeled the Hawara events a pogrom ... they were still shocked by the collective vengeance and mob violence ... There was reckoning, conversation and some condemnation from a few political leaders\", but in the later event, \"in the days since Ahimeir's killing and the vigilante terror on Palestinian villages, the events have hardly registered in the [Israeli] public discourse .... all of it seems like background noise. On the Israeli side, is Israeli mob and vigilante violence, extrajudicial killing or sheer terrorism becoming routine and forgettable?\"\n\n\n=== Palestine ===\nPalestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa condemned the attack on al-Mughayyir and urged authorities to assist the people of the village. He later issued a statement condemning the other attacks in the West Bank, and said that they would not discourage the Palestinian people from standing on their land.\nHamas issued a statement urging Palestinians to fight against \"settler militias\" on the day Achimeir's body was found.\nSuleiman Dawabsha, the mayor of the village of Dufa, told AFP that the West Bank \"has been in a state of war\" since the day Achimeir disappeared.\n\n\n=== International ===\nThe United States Department of State condemned the rising violence in the West Bank and encouraged Israel and the Palestinian Authority to de-escalate the situation. Spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that \"civilians are never legitimate targets\" and called on authorities to protect all communities from harm.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office released a statement calling on Israel to take immediate and concrete steps to end the escalating violence in the West Bank. United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese urged the UN to deploy a \"protective presence\" in the area to prevent and repel attacks against civilians, saying that the IDF had proven that it is unable to do so.\nThe Arab League denounced the settler attacks, which it said were often perpetrated under Israeli approval and protection. It added that the attacks are \"exacerbating a pervasive state of impunity and continued oppression of Palestinian lives and properties\".\nThe Foreign Ministry of the United Kingdom said it was alarmed by the increase in violence in the West Bank and said that it was causing an increase of violence in the wider region as well. It also urged Israeli authorities to conduct investigations into all of the deaths.\nThe Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the rising settler violence, saying that attacks on civilians should cease and their perpetrators should be brought to justice. It also condemned Israeli settlements, which it described as illegal and an obstacle to peace.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Brahma is an album by the Barry Altschul Trio, led by drummer Altschul, and featuring trombonist Ray Anderson and double bassist Mark Helias. It was recorded on January 23, 1980, at RPM Studios in New York City, and was released on vinyl later that year by Sackville Records. The album was remastered and reissued on CD in 2002.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote: \"In general, the music on this Sackville release is quite spontaneous and exploratory, but Anderson's playing sometimes hints strongly at earlier styles.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings stated that \"it's nice to be reminded of... how arresting a player Altschul could be in this company. There is a lovely version of the ballad 'Irina'... and there are a few moments which point back to classic jazz, whether as a result of the trombonist's influence or Altschul's own explorations isn't clear.\"\nA writer for Billboard commented: \"This tiny combo produces an astonishing variety of pleasing sounds... It's all subtle jazz, unspectacular but rewarding.\"\nJazz Word's Ken Waxman called the album \"historically important and musically impressive,\" and wrote: \"swinging elements are... mixed with the risk-taking solos. These rhythmic components still go far beyond the conventional. Altschul's solo on the 17-minute title track may hit a groove, but his bulls-eye beat is amplified with timbre scrambles using mallets and sticks, ratamacues and drags on toms and snares, plus numerous interjections that bring in cymbal shaking, bell-tree resonation, waterphone scrapes, cow bell thwacks and shrills from slide whistles.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Con Alma de Noche\" (Ray Anderson) – 6:10\n\"Irina\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:09\n\"Be Out S'Cool\" (Barry Altschul) – 6:59\n\"Brahma\" (Barry Altschul) – 16:54\n\"Lism\" (Mark Helias) – 4:14\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums, wood block, cymbal, cuica, waterphone, bells, shaker, whistling, cowbell, percussion\nRay Anderson – tenor trombone, alto trombone, sousaphone, cowbell, whistling\nMark Helias – double bass, cello\n\n\n== References ==",

NGC 5279 is in gravitational interaction with the galaxy NGC 5278. This pair of galaxies appears in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 239. The luminosity class of NGC 5279 is I1. NGC 5279 is a galaxy whose core shines in the ultraviolet region. It is listed in the Markarian catalog under the designation Mrk 271 (MK 271).\n\n\n== NGC 5278 Group ==\nAccording to Abraham Mahtessian, NGC 5278 and UGC 8671 form a pair of galaxies. Mahtessian further mentions that NGC 5278 and NGC 5279 form a pair of galaxies. In reality, these galaxies therefore form a trio of galaxies, the group of NGC 5278. The other galaxy in the same region of the celestial sphere is PGC 48439. With a radial speed of 11,939 km/s, this galaxy is almost two times further away than the members of this trio.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (5001–6000)\nLists of galaxies\nAstrophysics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 5279 at NASA/IPAC\nNGC 5279 at SIMBAD",

The structure, one of the historic maqams in the Middle East, is now in a ruined state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe religious complex was founded in the 18th century by the aristocratic Alghul family. During the Mandate period, the residents of Al-Nabi Yusha' (who were mostly Shi'ites) celebrated an annual mawsim festival at the site dedicated to the entombed prophet. In 2018, the site was vandalized by unknown perpetrators, who sprayed Talmudic graffiti on its walls.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Maqam an-Nabi Yusha' is a rectangular structure formed around a courtyard aligned north–south with an arched entrance on the north end while the two domed chambers, including the shrine-mausoleum, were located on the south end of the complex. The shrine is surrounded by fig trees and species of cactus growing around it.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaqam (shrine)\nMaqam Nabi Yusha' in Jordan\nTomb of Joshua in Israel\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bila Castle (Ukrainian: Білівський замок) is a lost defensive structure in the village of Bila, Chortkiv urban hromada, Chortkiv Raion, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine, and a newly discovered archeological site.\nThe remains of the castle were discovered by archaeologist Volodymyr Dobrianskyi in the fall of 2007.\n\n\n== Information ==\nToday, it is the only still surviving and well-preserved single-layer fortification monument of the 14th century in Western Podillia and is important for further archaeological research.\nIt is located on the outskirts of the village on a high cape-type hill, which is about 60 m above the level of the Seret River. This cape is an elongated triangular bend. The Seret River flows along the eastern part of the hill.\nThe castle has a total length of up to 100 m, and a width of 20 m in the southern section and 70 m in the northern section. The southern triangular part is cut by a ditch 5 m deep, about 15 m wide and 20 m long. The opposite, floor (northern) part of the castle is cut by an arcuate ditch 70 m long, 15 m wide, and 4-4.5 m deep. The perimeter section of the western part has a gentle slope, and the northern part has a rise on which the rampart is located. In the western corner, a well was found, preserved as a rounded pit of a depression 5 m in diameter and 1 m deep. In the southern corner, there is a triangular platform deepened by 1.5 m from the main part of the detinets, similar to the one in the western corner.\nDuring the archaeological survey, it was found that the finds were localized in the southwestern part of the castle spire. Fragments of 14th-century pottery and ironwork were found here.\nThe structures and fortification lines were designed with the successful use of the natural terrain. The eastern and northern sections of the hill have steep, inaccessible slopes that provided reliable defense capabilities during military engagements. On the southern and northern sides, the hillfort is cut by a deep moat. This moat is additionally covered with a rampart in the northern section.\nThe second line of defense consisted of triangular platforms in the southern and western areas, which were the prototype of curtains. And when the enemy managed to capture these areas, the defense was carried out from the detinets.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Losing Game is a 1941 detective novel by the Anglo-Irish writer Freeman Wills Crofts. It is the twenty second in his series of novels featuring the Golden Age detective Inspector French of Scotland Yard. It was published in the United States by Dodd, Mead under the alternative title A Losing Game.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAt his cottage outside a town thirty miles west of London, a moneylender with a successful sideline in blackmail is murdered and his property set on fire. Police trawl through his various victims in order to hunt the killer down. Suspicion falls in particular on a detective novelist who was in debt to the dead man and he is arrested. His sister calls in the assistance of Inspector French who she had once met, and he unofficially makes some inquiries. This raises enough doubts for his superiors to agree to his taking on the case. With the novelist on remand on a charge for murder, French with assistance from the man's sister, is able to discover that the real killer's motive sprung from another crime committed many years before in Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEvans, Curtis.

NGC 5278 is in gravitational interaction with the galaxy NGC 5279. This pair of galaxies appears in the Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 239. The luminosity class of NGC 5278 is II. The nucleus of this galaxy presents a burst of star formation (SBNG starburst nucleus galaxies) and it is an active Seyfert 2 type galaxy.

        "content": "The Whillan Beck is a river in the west of the Lake District National Park in the English county of Cumbria. Administratively, the whole of the course of the Whillan Beck lies in the civil parish of Eskdale and the unitary authority of Cumberland. \nThe Whillan Beck has its source at an altitude of 253 metres (830 ft) in the outflow from Burnmoor Tarn, a natural tarn that sits at the foot of Scafell. It flows into the River Esk at Beckfoot, near the village of Boot, at an altitude of 40 metres (130 ft). The beck descends 113 metres (371 ft) vertically in a horizontal distance of 5.5 kilometres (3.4 mi). It drains much of the water falling on Scafell, either via the tarn or by a number of streams that join it further downstream, and has a catchment area of 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi).\nIn its lower reaches, the Whillan Beck powers the Eskdale Mill, a grade II* listed corn mill in Boot. It then flows under the track of the narrow gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway just before its Dalegarth terminus, and as a consequence the railway has named one of its steam locomotives after the beck.\nThe Environment Agency defines a Whillan Beck water body, including its catchment area and tributaries. In 2022, this water body was classified as having a good ecological status.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tawag ng Tanghalan: The School Showdown is an amateur singing competition that currently airs as a segment of the noontime show It's Showtime that premiered on April 22, 2024.\n\n\n== Development ==\nNo information about this season was released until the finale of the second season of Tawag ng Tanghalan Kids, which was held two days before the season began, when the hosts teased about the new season.\n\n\n=== Auditions ===\nAuditions for The School Showdown were held simultaneously with the eighth season starting April 15, 2024.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nThe School Showdown premiered on April 22, 2024, just two days after the finale of Kids 2. This is the third special season and the fourth overall season to air on GTV after Duets, Year 7, and Kids 2, and the second season to air on GMA Network after Kids 2 following the show's debut on the network last April 6, 2024. \n\n\n== Hosts and judges ==\nVhong Navarro, Vice Ganda, Amy Perez, Kim Chiu, Karylle, Ogie Alcasid, Anne Curtis, Jhong Hilario and Darren Espanto reprised their hosting roles for this season.

Ion Perez debuted as the segments' newest gongmaster on April 29, 2024.\nThis season marked the return of Erik Santos, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Jed Madela, Klarisse de Guzman, Marco Sison, Dingdong Avanzado, Bituin Escalante, Nonoy Zuñiga, Nyoy Volante, Kean Cipriano, Mark Bautista and alternating head judges or punong hurados Louie Ocampo and Ogie Alcasid to the judging panel after a season break during the second Kids season.\n\n\n== Format ==\nTawag ng Tanghalan: The School Showdown features student contestants from different universities in the Philippines, representing the universities they are currently enrolled in. Similar to the rivalry between Ateneo and La Salle, the season will feature battles between student contenders from different universities competing to become the season's grand champion.\nThe season's format, similarly structured from the second kids season, is divided into four phases of \"examinations\":\n\nPhase I: Entrance Examinations — equivalent to the Daily Rounds, two student contenders from two different universities will battle in a head-to-head challenge for a slot in the weekly finals.\nPhase II: Preliminary Examinations — equivalent to the Weekly Finals, those who won during the daily rounds will compete for a slot in the semi-finals (or monthly finals) that will be held every Saturday.\nPhase III: Middle-term (Midterm) Examinations — equivalent to the Semi-Finals, those who won during the weekly finals will compete for a slot in the Grand Finals (or the Huling Tapatan) after four weekly finals.\nPhase IV: Final Examinations — equivalent to the Grand Finals or Huling Tapatan, those who won during the semi-finals will battle it out one last time to become the season's grand champion.\nStill, the criteria for judging remains the same: 50% for voice quality (includes intonation, enunciation, voice projection and technique); and the other 50% for the overall performance (includes timing, mastery of lyrics, stage presence and audience impact).\n\n\n== Prizes ==\nThe student contender with the higher score during the daily rounds will receive ₱10,000 while the losing student contender will receive ₱5,000.\n\n\n== Phase I: Entrance Examinations ==\nPhase I, dubbed as the Entrance Examinations is equivalent to the Daily Rounds, where two student contenders from two different universities will battle in a head-to-head challenge for a slot in the weekly finals.\n\n\n=== Summary of Phase I ===\n\n\n=== Results details ===\nContender's Information:Results Details:\nItalicized names denotes a contender is a resbaker\n\n\n==== Month 1 (April 22 to May 17) ====\n\n\n==== Month 2 ====\n\n\n== Phase II: Preliminary Examinations ==\nPhase II, dubbed as the Preliminary Examinations is equivalent to the Weekly Finals, where those who won during the daily rounds will compete for a slot in the semi-finals (or monthly finals) that will be held every Saturday (except on the final week).\n\n\n=== Summary of Phase II ===\nContender's Information:Results Details:\n\n\n=== Results details ===\n\n\n== Phase III: Midterm Examinations ==\nPhase III, dubbed as the Midterm Examinations is equivalent to the Semifinals, where those who won during the weekly finals will compete for a slot in the grand finals.\n\n\n=== Summary of Phase II ===\nContender's Information:\n\nResults Details:\n\n\n== Elimination table ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nScores\n\nSources",

        "content": "Live into 85 is a BBC New Year's Eve special broadcast on BBC One from 31 December 1984. The BBC's thirty-second Hogmanay-themed New Year's special, the programme contained Maggie Moone being sexually assaulted while trying to perform, a drunk John Grieve and a stricken Chic Murray fail to perform, and the Pipes and Drums of British Caledonian Airways refuse to leave the stage after performing. For this, the BBC declined to mount any Hogmanay specials for fourteen years.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFrom 1953, BBC One broadcast increasingly perfunctory Hogmanay-themed specials to see in the new year, which increasingly comprised drunk faded popstars and old-fashioned comedians making in-group and out-group jokes about other home nations in increasingly dilapidated studios. Regular participants included Jimmy Logan, Kenneth McKellar, Andy Stewart, Moira Anderson, and the City of Glasgow Police. ITV got in on the act in the late 1950s, airing its own similarly themed Hogmanay specials, to which Stewart later defected.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1984, the programme makers were reinvigorated by the English National Tourism Board making \"Make it Live in 1985\" their slogan and set about making that year's broadcast more inclusive towards English viewers. Hiring the Bootle-born entertainer Tom O'Connor, the English band Bucks Fizz, and the Birmingham-based singer Maggie Moone, a dwindling budget meant that the remaining acts comprised Moira Anderson, Chic Murray, Buff Hardie and Stephen Robertson, John Grieve, Bill Torrance, the Pipes and Drums of British Caledonian Airways, the Jim Johnstone Scottish Country Dance Band, and the Tom McShane Dancers, all from Scotland; Murray was in poor health at the time and would pass away a month later. A tour bus crash took Bucks Fizz out of action on 11 December, meaning they were replaced with Modern Romance. That year, ITV mounted The Hogmanay Show, a po-faced Hogmanay special similar to those aired in previous years, which featured Andy Stewart and other Scottish acts.\nO'Connor visited Gleneagles Hotel, the recording location, the day before broadcast, to recce the scene; disgusted by the lack of emergency tape, he badgered the producer until he agreed to film one of the bands and some other segments. The day of broadcast, temperatures were no higher than 4 °C (39 °F), conditions were hazardous, several acts were late arriving, and it became apparent that the producers had failed to secure the venue for exclusive use, meaning they would have to deal with recalcitrant members of the public. Over the course of the broadcast, a drunk John Grieve forgot his lines, a drunk audience member attempted to peer up Maggie Moone's skirt while she was performing and another sexually assaulted her, the kilted Pipes and Drums of British Caledonian Airways refused to decant into the venue's freezing cold car park, and Chic Murray was so flustered by the continuing presence of the Pipes and Drums that he became too bewildered to perform and spent his set berating the floor manager; eventually, the programme was taken off air early after Modern Romance performed \"Best Years of Our Lives\".\n\n\n== Reception and aftermath ==\nThe show went down poorly in both Scotland and England; Graham McCann of the British Comedy Guide used a December 2021 Comedy Chronicle to write that \"the Scottish newspapers appeared to be inaugurating a period of national mourning\" and that Norman Harper of The Press and Journal had described the show as \"an hour of televised tripe\". Dennis Hackett of The Times described the show as \"a shambles in content and production\", though felt that ITV's offering wasn't much better, and many viewers complained about the programme's poor quality. Retrospective reviews were not much better; The Guardian wrote in December 2008 that the show was a \"spectacular car-crash\", the Daily Record described it in December 2012 as \"one of Scotland's most embarrassing telly gaffs\", and Andrew Roberts of The Independent wrote in December 2014 that the host \"merited a special television award for maintaining his sang-froid\".\nThe following year, the BBC repeatedly reassured viewers that that year's offering would be free from bagpipes, accordions, and kilts; 1985's show began with Terry Wogan walking on stage with his flies down. No official end-of-year show was mounted for some years; 1987 saw in the new year with an episode of EastEnders, while Clive James filled in seven years between 1988–89 and 1994–95 with his own scabrous rantings and Angus Deayton took over thereafter. Hogmanay would not ooze into a BBC New Year's special broadcast outside of Scotland again until 1998, when BBC One simulcast New Year Live '98, an equally shambolic production presented and promoted poorly by Carol Smillie and Fred MacAulay, and BBC Two aired a documentary about Live into 85 presented by Mark Lamarr.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has been the official statistical data provider to the Australian Football League (AFL) since 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrincipally rooted in Australian rules football, the company was created by former Carlton footballer Ted Hopkins and his wife Angelika Oehme in 1995. Hopkins' vision was to tabulate statistical data from the Australian Football League (AFL) and provide a \"comprehensive and qualitative dimension\" with \"underlying analysis and commentaries\".\nThrough Champion Data, Hopkins launched the Rev Rankings in the Herald Sun in 1996, an early precursor of AFL Fantasy player ratings. By 1998, Champion Data's statistics were a feature of discussion on The Footy Show. The company then entered in a partnership with the AFL for 1999 and beyond to provide the league with statistical data, an agreement which continues to this day.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nHopkins and Oehme sold the business to private ownership in 2007, with the former continuing to work under contract at the company for a number of years following the sale. The current majority owner of the company is Champion Data's director, Chris Hume. The AFL holds the remaining 49-percent shareholder stake.\n\n\n== Other sports ==\nAs well as providing statistical analysis for the AFL Women's, the Talent League and various football state leagues, Champion Data also captures data for Netball Australia and Netball New Zealand's elite competitions. The company has also inked contracts with the National Rugby League, Premier Lacrosse League, and XFL.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Ki no Haseo (紀長谷雄; 845-912) was a Japanese scholar, poet and diplomat active in the Heian period. He belonged to the Ki clan, which was politically influential in the Nara period, but lost its original position before his birth. He was an acquittance of poets such as Miyako no Yoshika and Sugawara no Michizane, but was not closely affiliated with any political factions. In 894 he was appointed as a vice-ambassador during preparations to an ultimately canceled mission to China. He remained active as both a scholar and an official through the rest of his life. Many of works have been compiled in the collection Kikashū. While only one chapter survives, multiple poems and prose fragments which originally belonged to it have been identified. A second collection, Zoku Kike Shishū , is entirely lost. It is additionally sometimes proposed that he was also the author of Taketori Monogatari, but this remains uncertain. After his death a number of legends arose around him. Most notably, multiple variants of a tale in which he encounters an oni at Suzakumon are known.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Family background and early life ===\nHaseo was born as a member of the Ki clan, which unlike many other families of Heian period scholars was already considered politically influential in the preceding Nara period, though in the ninth century it was weakened and its members most likely held no hereditary positions. Haseo's father was Ki no Sadanori (紀貞範). Nothing else is known about his close relatives.\nAs a teenager Haseo studied under Miyako no Yoshika and Ōkura no Yoshiyuki, but his career in the subsequent decade of his life remains poorly known, and he only entered the academy in 876. He became a student of literature. A year later he met Sugawara no Michizane, who remained his close friend through the rest of his life. Over the course of 882 and 883, he was among officials appointed to accompany envoys from Balhae during their stay in the capital and on the journey back to Kaga.\n\n\n=== Graduation ===\nIn 884 Haseo was declared a graduate student at the recommendation of Michizane, who in his evaluation favorably compared him to Yan Hui, the favorite disciple of Confucius. He was subsequently appointed to the position of secretary of Sanuki; in 886 he was promoted to junior secretary in the Council of State, in 890 to the director of the Bureau of Books and Drawings and in 891 to professor of history and literature. He became a renowned scholar of Chinese literature. His writings indicate he valued the works of Pan Yue and Xie Lingyun, but regarded Wang Bi and He Yan unfavorably.\nAs a scholar Haseo for the most part abstained from factional disputes, though he was viewed unfavorably by Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki due to positive treatment he received from Michizane. According to an anecdote preserved in the Gōdanshō, Kiyoyuki criticized his appointment to the position of a professor. The same source states that Haseo worried about the Fujiwara clan gaining control over scholarly circles, and that he sided with Miyako no Yoshika during a conflict sparked by Fujiwara no Sukeyo's intent to undergo examination as the first of its member to enter the academy.\n\n\n=== Appointment as vice-ambassador to China ===\nIn 894 Haseo was supposed to accompany Michizane during a diplomatic mission to China as a vice-ambassador, but this project was canceled at the request of the latter. The reasons behind this decision are unclear, though it is possible the high cost of official missions and the proliferation of contacts with private Chinese traders granting Japan access to luxury goods without the need to send envoys to the continent were among the factors. Furthermore, piracy became a major issue starting with 893. Despite the abandonment of the plans to send him to China, Haseo continued to use the title of vice-ambassador for seven years, presumably due the prestige of this appointment. In 895 as a diplomat he took part in a poetic exchange organized for the ambassador of Balhae.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn 895 Haseo was appointed a junior assistant head of the Shikibu-shō; a year later he became the head of academy, though he continued to fulfill his duties in the ministry as well, and in 896 was promoted to senior assistant head.\nIn 903 Michizane entrusted Haseo with his new poem collection, Kanke Kōshū (菅家後集, \"The Later Sugawara Collection\"), which was entirely written after his exile to Dazaifu. It has been suggested that its popularization in the following years was one of the factors leading to the posthumous rehabilitation of Michizane. Haseo might have also been responsible for interceding with the imperial court on behalf of Michizane's sons.\nIn 907 Haseo was appointed as the governor of Sanuki. In 908 he participated in the compilation of Engi kyaku (延喜格), a collection of official documents of the daijō-kan and imperial edicts. In 911 he became a middle counselor, and in this capacity acted as one of the advisors of emperor Daigo.\n\n\n=== Descendants ===\nKi no Yoshimochi was Haseo's son. His grandson was Ki no Arimasa, who held the position of a professor of literature. His more distant relatives include Ki no Tsurayuki and Ki no Tomonori, the compilers of the Kokin Wakashū, who belonged to a different branch of the Ki clan.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\nKi no Haseo was considered one of the leading kanshi poets of his times. He started composing at the age of eighteen. Like many other middle Heian poets, including Miyako no Yoshika, Shimada no Tadaomi, Ono no Takamura and Sugawara no Michizane, he was influenced by the works of Bai Juyi. Many of his poems are preserved in the Honchō Monzui'; additionally, four of his waka can be found in Gosen Wakashū. His various kanbun writings were collected in a volume known as Kikashū (紀家集), \"the Ki family collection\". It is poorly preserved, with only one of the original twenty chapters surviving. However, 56 poems originally belonging to it have been identified in other sources. A second collection of his poetry, Zoku Kike Shishū (續紀家詩集), is entirely lost.\n\n\n=== Other genres ===\nIn addition to poems, examples of Haseo's prose also survive, including 52 fragments originally collected in the Kikashū. He was also the author of Engi Igo Shijo (延喜以後詩序; \"A Preface to My Sinitic Poems Composed Since the Beginning of the Engi Era\") in which he criticizes scholars in the court of emperor Daigo for their inability to express personal feelings through poetry. Some of his other prose works, including Bai Hakucho ō jo (\"Introduction to the Old Man who Sold White Chopsticks\") and Shiraishi Sensei den (白石先生伝; \"Account of the Master of the White Stone\"), reflect his interest in legends about Daoist immortals. In Honchō Shinsen-den (本朝神仙伝; \"Accounts of Japanese Immortals\"), Ōe no Masafusa states that the included version of the former story is merely an abridged retelling of Haseo's.\nA number of prayers attributed to Haseo are also known. One example is the Honmyō Saimon (本命祭文), which focuses on Chinese deities invoked to extend a person's lifespan, such as Siming, Silu (司禄), Tiancao (天曹), Difu (地府), Hebo (河伯) and Shuiguan (水官).\n\n\n=== Taketori Monogatari authorship theory ===\nIt is sometimes proposed that Haseo was the author of Taketori Monogatari. Richard H. Okada points out that he was well versed with kanbun and familiar with literary motifs pertaining to Daoist immortals, assumed to be an influence on this tale. He also highlights that some of his works, like the poem Song of a Destitute Woman, show an unusual degree of concern for the position of women in society, which he argues to be an element visible in Taketori Monogatari as well. However, other candidates have also been suggested, including Minamoto no Shitagō, Minamoto no Tōru, Henjō and Ki no Tsurayuki. No theory found universal acceptance so far, leaving the identity of the author uncertain.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\n\n=== Encounter with an oni ===\n\n\n==== Sources ====\n\nA legend describing Ki no Haseo's game of sugoroku with an oni might have been in circulation as early as late as in the twelfth century, though written evidence only goes back to the late thirteenth century. The earliest versions have been identified in Zoku Kyōkunshō (続教訓抄), a musical treatise written at some point after 1270 by the court musician Koma no Tomokazu (狛朝葛; 1247–1331), and in a number of commentaries on the anthology Wakan Rōeishū. A version of this legend is also preserved in the scroll Haseo Sōshi from the collection of the Eisei Bunko Museum. It was formerly assumed that it was originally created in the fifteenth century, but the consensus shifted towards late thirteenth or early fourteenth century (late Kamakura period) dating. It is considered an early example of otogizōshi, though due to its relatively short length and early dating it is sometimes described as a setsuwa in emaki form instead. The version of the legend preserved in it has been translated into English as A Tale of Lord Haseo by Noriko T. Reider and as Haseo and the Gambling Stranger by Kristopher L. Reeves.\n\n\n==== Summary ====\n\nThe legend begins with a stranger approaching Haseo to offer him a game of sugoroku, to which he agrees. They arrive in the abode of the latter, Suzakumon, where they make a bet: if the stranger loses, he will present Haseo with an unusual woman, while in the reverse situation Haseo will have to forfeit all of his riches. Haseo soon realizes he is not playing against a human, as the previously disguised stranger gradually reveals his true form as an oni to him due to the stakes of the game making him emotional. He nonetheless eventually manages to win, and the oni introduces him to a young woman, warning him that despite her beauty he needs to be cautious, as it would be unsafe to make love to her sooner than in exactly a hundred days. Haseo at first obeys his instructions, but he grows attached to the woman, and after 80 days he starts to doubt if it is necessary. He embraces her, but she instantly turns into liquid, prompting him to mourn. Three months later Haseo encounters the oni again, but this time he acts hostile towards him, prompting him to call upon the protection of Tenjin, the deified Sugawara no Michizane. The oni is repelled, and the narrator reveals that he regretted entrusting the woman to Haseo and that she was created by him from pieces of corpses and would only gain a soul after 100 days.\n\n\n==== Parallels with other legends ====\nThe legend of Haseo's encounter with an oni is considered one of the multiple examples of tales about talented scholars encountering supernatural creatures. According to Reider, it shows particularly close similarities with legends about Miyako no Yoshika encountering the oni of Rashōmon; she suggests the two stories might have been sometimes confused with each other or viewed as partially interchangeable, as in a number of variants Haseo meets the oni at Rashōmon and Yoshika at Suzakumon. A further related legend dealing with an oni interested in fine arts encountering a scholar focuses on Minamoto no Hiromasa.\nThe creation of a new person from pieces of corpses is also described as a skill of oni in a legend recorded in the Senjūshō in which Saigyō after hearing about it attempts to replicate the process of Mount Kōya. Another example of a similar motif is a legend from the preface of the treatise Sangoku Sōden Onmyō Kankatsu Hoki Naiden Kin'u Gyokuto-shū (三國相傳陰陽輨轄簠簋内伝金烏玉兎集) in which Abe no Seimei is resurrected by the sage Hakudō Shōnin (伯道上人), who assembles his \"12 big bones and 360 small bones\" to accomplish that.\n\n\n==== Modern reception ====\nModern literary adaptations of the legend include Takeshi Umehara's Haseo no Koi (\"Haseo's Love\") and Baku Yumemakura's Ki no Haseo Suzakumon ni te onna wo arasoi oni to sugoroku wo suru koto (紀長谷雄朱雀門にて女を争い鬼と双六をする語; \"Ki no Haseo Plays Sugoroku with an Oni at Suzaku Gate with a Bet of a Woman\"). While both authors remain largely faithful to the original legend, they omit the appearance of Tenjin, and instead focus on portraying the oni as acting friendly towards Haseo as a fellow connoisseur of the fine arts. Furthermore, while in the original legend the woman receives no name and never speaks, Yumemakura makes her an active participant in the events who actively develops a relationship with Haseo.\n\n\n=== Other legends ===\nThe thirteenth century Hase-dera Genki (長谷寺験記; \"A Record of the Miracles of Hase Temple\") states that Haseo was named in honor of Hase-dera because he was born after his father prayed there to the bodhisattva Kannon.\nA tale from Konjaku Monogatarishū (volume 24, tale 1), Kitanohe Minister and Ki no Haseo, describes a meeting between Ki no Haseo and a spirit reciting poetry on moonlit nights on top of Suzakumon. Another legend from the same collection (volume 28, story 29) portrays Haseo as a talented scholar who is nonetheless unfamiliar with onmyōdō, and as a result ignores the advice of an onmyōji who divines that he will encounter a harmless oni, who turns out to be a dog who disturbs a meeting held by him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "A Hora da Liberdade (The Hour of Freedom) is a Portuguese docudrama produced and aired by SIC in 1999 which portraits the events that led to the military coup on 25 April 1974, responsible for the restoration of democracy in Portugal. It was produced by Emídio Rangel Hayley Westenra, Rodrigo de Sousa e Castro and Joana Pontes who also assured its direction. From the interviews made to create the film, the book \"A Hora da Liberdade - O 25 de Abril pelos protagonistas\" was created, published by Editorial Bizâncio. It was considered one of the best movies on the topic of the Carnation Revolution according to Time Out Magazine.\nWith the launch of OPTO, SIC's streaming platform, the film was launched on 24 November 2020.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film took one month to prepare and two months to be filmed, involving around 60 actors and around a thousand incidentals. The primary obstacles for the creation of the film were the script and what was to be shot, and the work with the actors who showed their youth, courage and maturity.\nTo assure a faithful recreation of the events, the film was broadcast from the night of 24 April 1999 to the early hours of 26 April 1999, in thirteen parts, in order to follow the events in real time. The film spearheaded SIC's season for the 25th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which started on 1 April with a series of short subjects about the New State.\nBecause it was impossible for viewers to follow the entire film in the way it was presented, SIC reprogrammed the film in its entirety for 26 April.\nInstead of recreating the announcement of Grândola, Vila Morena and the acts at Lago do Carmo, the actual recordings from this period were used.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMost of the roles were selected by actors with similar physical appearances to the characters they portrayed.\n\nAlberto Villar – Lieutenant Colonel Correia de Campos\nAlexandre de Sousa – Commander Vítor Crespo\nAlfredo Brito - Colonel António Romeiras\nAlmeno Gonçalves – Lieutenant Coronel Almeida Bruno\nAndré Gago – Brito e Cunha\nAndré Gomes - Minister Moreira Baptista\nAntónio Caldeira Pires - Capitão Rui Rodrigues\nAntónio Capelo – Major Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho\nAntónio Cordeiro – Captain Andrade e Sousa\nAntónio Fonseca - Major Hugo Velasco\nAntónio Pedro Cerdeira – Lieutenant Andrade e Silva\nArtur Ramos (†) – Brigadier Junqueira dos Reis\nBenjamin Falcão – Colonel Belo de Carvalho\nCarlos Gomes – Major Cardoso Fontão\nCarlos Lacerda (†) – Lieutenant Colonel Viana de Lemos\nCarlos Pisco - Tenente Cabaças Ruaz\nCristina Carvalhal – Clarisse Guerra\nDiogo Morgado - Aspirante Teixeira\nEduardo Viana – Lieutenant Colonel Ferrand D’Almeida\nEurico Lopes – Joaquim Furtado\nFrancisco Pestana – Lieutenant Coronel Lopes Pires\nGonçalo Waddington – Lieutenant Almas Imperial\nGuilherme Filipe – Major Pato Anselmo\nHeitor Lourenço – Alferes Sottomayor\nHenrique Feist – Alferes David e Silva\nIvo Canelas – Tenente Santos Silva\nJoão de Carvalho – Capitão Luís Macedo\nJorge Gonçalves – Major Sanches Osório\nJorge Sequerra (†) - Lieutenant Coronel Nascimento\nJosé Boavida (†) – Captain Bicho Beatriz\nJosé Jorge Duarte – Pedro Feytor Pinto\nJosé Manuel Mendes – Marcello Caetano\nJúlio Cardoso – General António de Spínola\nLuís Alberto – General Adriano Pires\nLuís Esparteiro – Major Costa Neves\nLuís Lucas – Captain Santos Ferreira\nLuís Mascarenhas – Minister Silva Cunha\nManuel Coelho – Major Delfim Moura\nManuel Wiborg – Captain Salgueiro Maia\nMarcantónio Del Carlo – Lieutenant Colonel Garcia dos Santos\nMarcello Urghege - Captain Santos Coelho\nMárcia Breia – citizen\nMarco Delgado – Captain Luís Pimentel\nMarques D’Arede – Colonel Álvaro Fontoura\nPaulo Filipe - Commander Coutinho Lanhoso\nPaulo Matos – Major Hugo dos Santos\nPaulo Oom – C.I.A.A.C.

        "content": "NGC 7828 is a peculiar galaxy in the constellation Cetus. The galaxy lies about 300 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 7828 is approximately 75,000 light years across. It was discovered by American astronomer Francis Leavenworth in 1886.  NGC 7828 forms a pair with its neighbor NGC 7829. The galaxy is included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the elliptical galaxies emanating material category as Arp 144.\nNGC 7828 is interacting with NGC 7829, lying about 30 arcseconds from its nucleus. The interaction of the two galaxies, which have similar mass, has led to the creation of an empty ring in NGC 7828. The nucleus of NGC 7828 is obscured in visual light, but it is more visible in the infrared. The ring appears to be partial in H-alpha. The star formation rate of the ring galaxy is estimated to be 6.86 M☉ per year. The two galaxies are surrounded by a neutral hydrogen gas cloud extending to the southeast for 6 arcminutes and 3 arcminutes to the west.\nTwo supernovae have been observed in NGC 7828, AT2018ewx and SN 2021ocs. SN 2021ocs was a type Ic supernova discovered around maximum magnitude. Its spectrum was unusual, being dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission lines. It was discovered on May 30, 2021, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) astronomical survey and had an apparent magnitude of 17.7.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInteracting galaxy\nList of NGC objects (7001–7840)\nLists of galaxies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNGC 7828 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images\nNGC 7828 at SIMBAD",

        "content": "The Tüllinger Tunnel, more commonly known as the Tüllinger-Berg Tunnel, is an 864-meter-long railway tunnel on the Weil am Rhein-Lörrach railway line (Gartenbahn) between the cities of Weil am Rhein and Lörrach in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Opened in 1890, the single-tube tunnel has a clearance for two tracks; however, it is only used for one track. The Tüllinger Tunnel is located between the Lörrach Dammstraße and Weil am Rhein Ost stops.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe tunnel passes under the southern foothills of the Tüllinger Berg, which gives the structure its name. The tunnel's western portal, located in the middle of a residential area in Alt-Weil, is in the city of Weiler. The structure initially runs straight from southwest to east, then curves to the right and comes within about 11 meters of the Swiss border. At the east portal, the rail line has risen about six meters. The east portal, located in a wooded and impassable area, is also in the town of Weiler, just a few meters from the city limits of Lörrach. About 100 meters east of the east portal, the line crosses the Wiesebrücke bridge to Stetten, which crosses the Wiese and the B 317 highway.\n\nThe tunnel crosses layers of molasse rock consisting of clay marl, limestone , and partially leached gypsum marl.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nOf the total 863.9 meters of tunnel construction, 245.8 meters were initially constructed with a closed wall profile. The remaining 618.1 meters of the tunnel consisted only of abutments and a ceiling vault. The entire length of the completed tunnel is lined. The vault was installed at the base of the tunnel only after the tunnel was completed. Once the tunnel was completely lined, the invert was constructed. Limestone from Lörrach and Inzlingen was used for the abutments. The height from the floor to the crown is 5.7 meters. Every 25 meters in the tunnel there are two opposite niches 1 meter wide, 2.1 meters high, and 0.9 meters deep.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction work ===\nThe railroad between Weil and Lörrach, planned as a strategic route to bypass Switzerland, required a tunnel through the Tüllinger Berg, which separates the two towns, because of their border location and the unavoidable intersection of the villages. The Oberländer Bote reported on December 23, 1887:\n\n\"Construction of the new line has now begun on this side of the Tüllinger Berg and a number of workers are currently busy laying the track bed from Baseler Chaussee to the Wiese. There are also workers on the lower meadows. However, there are not many of them yet, and the onset of heavy frost may make it necessary to suspend the work completely for some time. Work on laying the second track on the Stetten-Lörrach line is also expected to start soon. So there should be no shortage of work in our region in the near future.\"\nWork began on the west side of the lower tunnel on February 5, 1888, and on the east side on March 21, 1888. Excavation was done in two shifts, each shift consisting of six miners and six haulers. Masonry work began on the west side on May 16 and the east side on June 18, 1888. The tunnel was broken through on October 4, 1888, at about 6 p.m. The tunnel was opened to traffic on May 20, 1890. The excavation was done with great precision. While there was a deviation of 7 centimeters in direction, the deviation in height was 0. The construction costs were estimated at 1 million marks, of which almost 40% was for earth and rock moving work and a good half for the lining and vaulting. The comparatively short construction time for the tunnel can be explained by the strategic military importance of the structure in terms of being able to relocate armed forces to this part of the country. To be able to cope with any sudden mass transport, the tunnel was also built with two tracks to ensure the efficiency of the transport line.\n\n\n=== Since the opening ===\nTowards the end of World War II, on April 23, 1945, the Tüllinger Tunnel was to be blown up by a demolition squad because of the approaching French troops. A soldier on guard duty, who was privy to the plan, informed a fellow soldier and had the blasting wires cut, which ultimately prevented the blast.\nOver the decades, repairs have been made to various parts of the tunnel.\nAccording to an assessment by Deutsche Bahn in 2015, the Tüllinger Tunnel was in a condition worthy of renovation. In the worst case, even a new construction would have to be considered. An accurate assessment could only be made with detailed planning. After a new investigation, Deutsche Bahn announced in 2020 that the tunnel did not need to be renovated and that no technical measures were necessary. The decision was based on regular inspections and continuous measurements of the tunnel lining.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTüllinger Tunnel\nWeil/Rhein–Lörrach/Baden (Gartenbahn)\nBaden-Württemberg State Archives: Leopoldshöhe-Lörrach railroad construction: Tüllinger Tunnel (plans, progress register)\nGerman Digital Library: Plans and photographs of the Tüllinger Tunnel\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAugust von Würthenau: Denkschrift über die Erbauung der Bahnen im Badischen Oberland Leopoldshöhe–Lörrach, Schopfheim–Säckingen, Weizen–Immendingen zur Umgebung des Schweizergebiets.

He was a five-time winner of the 100 metres freestyle at the Irish Championships and qualified for the 1948 Summer Olympics. After travelling to London for the Olympics, Kavanagh and his teammates were forced to withdraw at the last minute when the International Swimming Federation barred two of their squad from competing as they were from the north.\nA Leinster Schools Cup-winner with Blackrock College, Kavanagh went on to play rugby at UCD and won two Ireland caps, against England at Twickenham in 1952 and Wales at Cardiff in 1955. His younger brother Ronnie was also an Ireland player and both were on the 1952 tour of South America, making uncapped appearances against Argentina.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatrick Kavanagh at ESPNscrum",

The competition took place on two different circuits:\n\nfrom 1971 to 1972: Circuit Zolder;\nfrom 1973 to 2003 and after 2022: Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps.\nWhen the Bol d'Or moved from Bugatti Circuit to Circuit Paul Ricard at the end of 1977, the ACO created the 24 Heures Moto. The race became one of \"the classics\" of endurance racing along with the 24 Hours of Liège, the 8 Hours Of Suzuka, and the Bol d'Or.\nAt the end of 2001, the three 24 Hour classic races (Le Mans, Liège and the Bol d'Or) withdrew from the Endurance World Championship to create the Master of Endurance (an Endurance competition consisting on the 3 races that was held between 2002 and 2005). Le Mans and Bol d'Or returned to the Endurance FIM World Championship in 2006, but 24 Hours of Liége didn't while the track had lost FIM homolgation. \nAfter twenty years of interruption, the race returned renamed as 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and as part of the FIM Endurance World Championship calendar with a ten-year contract.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== By manufacturer ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nFIM Endurance World Championship\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Beatrice Jospehine Nazareth e Fernandes (née Nazareth; born 18 April 1945), known professionally as Betty Naz, is an Indian former actress and singer known for her work in Konkani films and tiatr productions.\nNazareth is a known figure in the realm of Konkani music and drama, known for her contributions and popularity among enthusiasts. With a career that commenced at the young age of 10, Nazareth has amassed a repertoire of stage performances spanning nearly six decades in Mangalorean and Goan Konkani theatre. By 2013, her vocal talents had graced over 250 Konkani audio albums, while her stage presence had been witnessed in nearly 3000 shows. Known for her versatility as both an actor and singer, Nazareth has established herself as an entertainer. Her acting skills have been praised for both her stage performances in tiatr productions and her appearances in movies, leading to various awards and recognition. Nazareth is known for her contributions to Muthukrishna Das's Konkani films, such as Jivit Amchem Oxem (1972) and Boglantt (1975). Her voice, especially in the singing of cantos in tiatr performances, remains memorable and influential.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBeatrice Jospehine Nazareth was born on 28 April 1945 in the island of Mazgaon, Bombay (now Mumbai), which was part of the Bombay Presidency during the colonial era. Her family originally hailed from Mangalore. Her father, Aloysius Luis Nazareth, worked as a mechanic but was also involved in the local theatre scene as a performer. Her mother hails from the village of Bolkunje in Mangalore, while her father originally resided in the area of Bejai and later relocated to the town panchayat of Belthangady. Seeking improved opportunities, her parents migrated to Bombay. Nazareth was the third of seven children born to Aloysius and his wife, Elizabeth. From a young age, Nazareth was exposed to Konkani performance traditions through her father's work. Aloysius was a singer and composer who participated in Mangalorean theatrical productions. He even integrated the young Nazareth into one of his plays when she was an infant. Nazareth continued this family tradition of stage performance, taking part in school theatrical productions as she grew up. This background in the Konkani arts laid the foundation for Nazareth' later career.\nNazareth's early career in the performing arts can be traced back to her childhood experiences in the theater scene of Mazgaon, (now a neighborhood in Mumbai, India). When Nazareth was young, her father was cast in a play directed by AT Lobo, who recognized Nazareth's potential and gave her a role as a child performer. Mazgaon had a Konkani theater culture, with local Goan resident Rodrigues regularly staging short dramatic works in the regional language of Konkani. Given the large Catholic population in Nazareth's building, these community-based productions provided her with frequent opportunities to take the stage. Rodrigues eventually incorporated Nazareth into his own tiatr (Konkani theatrical production). Nazareth's involvement in Mazgaon's theater scene also led her to connect with a nearby Mangalorean theater association that featured Goan artists such as Succorine, Rico Rod, Titta Pretto, and Antonette Mendes. \nParticipating in this broader network of Konkani and Mangalorean performers allowed Nazareth to gain experience and recognition early in her career. The annual feast of Saint Anne on 26 July was a particularly important event for the Mazgaon theater community, with several plays and skits staged to commemorate the occasion. Nazareth's involvement in these productions helped her hone her craft and standing within the local performing arts scene. Through her father's initial theatrical role, the mentorship of Lobo, and her immersion in Mazgaon's Konkani and Mangalorean theater cultures, Nazareth was able to establish the foundations of her performing career from a young age, setting the stage for her later career.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNazareth embarked on her theatrical journey during her childhood, immersing herself in the world of amateur theater at a tender age of 10. Her talents were immediately recognized during her debut performance, which took place at St. Anne's Church in Mazagaon, where she participated in the parish feast shows. It was this early display of skill that caught the attention of Maurice Cabral, a figure in the theater scene from Mangalore. In 1958, at the age of 13, Nazareth received a significant professional opportunity when Cabral offered her a leading role in his play Deswat. Eager to embrace the chance to showcase her abilities, she embraced the role, marking her arrival on the Konkani stage. Her performance in this tiatr left an impression on the directors of that era. Continuing her collaboration with Cabral, Nazareth went on to work on various plays, including productions such as Bhorvoso, Vaddol, Aneeth, and Kangan. Her acting prowess in plays such as Vhoni ani Dher, Tujem Durigmojea Bhatant, and Mojo Put Padri received acclaim and admiration from the public. These successful performances not only solidified her position in Konkani theater but also attracted attention from other directors, including AT Lobo, Suny D'Souza, Lawry Andrade, Cha-Fra, Francis Fernandes Cascia, and AC Misquith. As a result, Nazareth quickly ascended to the pinnacle of popularity among Konkani theater enthusiasts. Nazareth managed to captivate audiences through her singing and acting abilities, despite lacking any formal training in these disciplines. Her father, who had previously worked with directors like AT Lobo, himself had a background in stage acting, contributing to Nazareth' artistic upbringing. While other members of her family possessed artistic talents, they did not pursue them as professional careers to the same extent as Nazareth.\nNazareth, driven by her passion for acting, pursued employment to secure her livelihood. She embarked on a nine-year tenure with the Bombay-based Philips company, until circumstances compelled her to relinquish her position when the company relocated to Poona. Concurrently engaged in acting ventures across Mumbai, Mangalore, and Goa, Nazareth showcased her vocal prowess in over 250 audio albums. Collaborating with figures such as M. Boyer's Golden Goa album, Rosary Fernandes, Romeo Mendes, Prince Jacob, Chris-Meena, Lawrence Saldhana, Connie M, Julie Rod, and Kenny, Nazareth established herself as a versatile singer. While initially balancing both acting and singing, Nazareth received counsel from Mangalorean directors, who advised her to prioritize acting due to the inherent difficulties of maintaining proficiency in both disciplines. Nevertheless, in Goa, Nazareth once again found herself in an environment that embraced her multifaceted talents, as the local stage demanded performers to excel in both singing and acting. She further contributed her vocal artistry to musical events organized by figures such as Victor Concesso, Kenny, Tony Martin, and others. She has also showcased her vocal talents alongside a Hindi orchestra in the city of Mumbai. Embracing membership in the Goan association, Nazareth reaped significant benefits by immersing herself in the realm of Goan professional theatre.\nThroughout her career, Nazareth remained actively engaged in professional shows within the theater scene of Goa. As a consequence, she made the difficult decision to bid farewell to her stage career in Mangalore, opting instead to concentrate on the artistic Goan stage. This allowed her to secure significant roles and collaborate with some of the popular Konkani directors of the time, including C. Alvares, Prem Kumar, M. Boyer, Joe Rose, Rosary Ferns, Tony Martin, Cristina Vaz, Peter Fernandes, and Mike Mehta, among others. Nazareth achieved acclaim in Goa through her performances in several influential plays, such as Laz Naslolo Konn, Khoto Poiso, Vaante, Donn Kalzan, and Sezarachi Combi. Her talent also extended to the realm of film, as she had the opportunity to act in two Konkani feature films, namely Boglantt and Jivith Amchem Oxem, both directed by Bangalore-based director Muthukrishna Das. In the Konkani movie Boglantt, director Prem Kumar, recognizing her acting skills, honored Nazareth with the title \"Meena Kumari of Konkani Theatre\". Beyond her stage and film endeavors, Nazareth further showcased her versatility by appearing in a number of Konkani video films. Her talent and popularity transcended regional boundaries, leading her and the Goan team to embark on international tours, captivating audiences in destinations such as Dubai, Muscat, Kuwait, Bahrain, Doha, London, Israel, and Canada. Their performances included the Konkani drama Fulan ani Kantte, a production reminiscent of a non-stop opera.\nIn India, Nazareth has undertaken extensive tours across cities such as Pune, Karwar, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Kolkata, where she has demonstrated her artistic talents through live performances. While actively engaged in the Goan entertainment industry, Nazareth has continued her affiliation with Mangalore. In 2008, she made a significant contribution to the Konkani Niranthari program organized by Mandd Sobhann, which subsequently set a Guinness World Record. In addition to her career, she has displayed her acting talent in eight plays written by Francis Fernandes Cascia, most known in the successful production Mataro Chorbela. This play has received widespread acclaim internationally, with over 60 performances staged worldwide. As of 2013, furthermore, Nazareth portrayed a prominent role in a new drama penned by Francis Fernandes. A testament to her talent, Nazareth has continued to assume leading roles in theatrical productions even after surpassing the age of 40, although she now adeptly embodies characters such as mothers, sisters, or sisters-in-law, aligning with the conventional trajectory for actresses of her age. It is worth noting that actresses over 40 are seldom presented with opportunities to portray heroines, making Nazareth fortunate to secure some of the most coveted roles even in the later stages of her career. Throughout her artistic journey, Nazareth has popularized a diverse repertoire of songs, including \"Galfak Vetam,\" \"Nach Goynkara\" from Ivor D Cunha's musical show, as well as captivating melodies featured in her debut cassette tape, such as \"Bebdo Gabru, \"Poppat Bai,\" and \"Mammicho ugdas,\" among others.\nDuring the production of a Konkani film, Rico Rod received a visit from Muthukrishna Das, who traveled from Bangalore to seek his assistance. Das articulated his aspiration to produce a cinematic work in Konkani and sought Rico's expertise in the casting procedures. Leveraging his connection with writer-director Maurice Cabral, Rico approached Cabral to help in the selection of actors. Cabral, together with Rico, introduced Nazareth to Das, leading to her selection as the lead actress in Das's debut Konkani film, Jivit Amchem Oxem. Nazareth shared the screen with actors such as Dr. Ramani, Cecilia Machado, and South Indian actors, including Pandari Bai. Following that, Nazareth was featured in another Konkani film by Das, titled Boglantt, playing the character of a mother to actor Prem Kumar. Alongside her involvement in Das's films, Nazareth concurrently participated in Rico Rod's tiatr production titled Unni Ani Der  However, due to a request from director C. Alvares, Francis Fernandes Cassia kindly released Nazareth from her commitment to a Mangalorean drama, which was in the midst of rehearsals. This was to accommodate Nazareth's participation in Alvares's ladies show called Khoincho Sakrament. Through her collaboration with Rico Rod and C. Alvares, Nazareth made her debut on the Goan tiatr stage. Subsequently, she delivered several acclaimed performances, showcasing her talents in both singing and acting, while working with popular directors such as M. Boyer, Prem Kumar, and Remmie Colaço. Additionally, Nazareth made appearances in the khell tiatrs directed by Rosario Rodrigues.\nNazareth also emerged as a popular figure in the realm of khell tiatrs, a traditional form of Goan theatrical entertainment. She gained recognition by participating in various tiatrs directed by individuals such as Menino de Bandar, Roseferns, and A. M. Pacheco. Her most recent recorded public appearance occurred in a theatrical production overseen by Pacheco in the 2015–16 season. In 1989, Nazareth ventured into production, overseeing the creation of an audio cassette entitled Devachem Besanv. The recording showcased the talents of her spouse, Abdon, and their young son, Aaron, who was just four years old during the recording. The musical accompaniment for the cassette was crafted by Nazareth' husband and Annibal Crasto. Throughout her involvement in tiatrs, Nazareth garnered acclaim for her contributions to the Mangalorean stage. It is worth mentioning that directors often composed special cantos exclusively tailored to her vocal abilities, indicating the high value placed on her singing prowess. When reflecting on her most memorable performance amidst the several tiatrs she has acted in, Nazareth highlights the Mangalorean tiatr Kankon (Bangle), which was written and directed by Maurice Cabral. This particular production explored the theme of extramarital affairs, in which Nazareth portrayed a modest wife. However, a highlight of her role was a captivating dance performance, wherein her character was observed by her on-screen husband through a transparent glass partition. Nazareth' body of work encompasses various tiatrs, including performances in productions like M. Boyer's Ekuch Rosto, Renmie Colaço's Atancho Temp, and C. Alvares' Konnem Lailo Uzo, (where she portrayed a character struggling with drug addiction), Prem Kumar's Jawan, Menino de Bandar's Soglleank Gorjechem (depicting a tale of fortune reversal), and Rosario Rodrigues's theatrical works such as Fulam ani Kolle and Uzvadd Pallovlo.\nSince its establishment in 1995, Nazareth has served as the treasurer of the Maharashtra Konkani Kala Saunstha, an organization dedicated to promoting Konkani arts and culture. In addition to her acting work, Nazareth is acclaimed for her skills as a kantar singer. She has contributed her vocal talents to several commercial music productions, lending her voice to recordings by various producers. Nazareth has appeared in theatrical productions directed by several popular Konkani dramatists, including C. Alvares, M. Boyer, Jacinto Vaz, Remmie Colaço, Robin Vaz, Alfred Rose, Rico Rod, Chris Perry, Titta Pretto, Prem Kumar, Mike Mehta, Rosario Rodrigues, Roseferns, Menino De Bandar, Chris Meena, and Samuel Carvalho. Her filmography also includes roles in Konkani music videos, such as Dison Kuddo, Aikon Bhero, Atancheo Sunno, and Bombay to Goa. According to writer Wilson Mazarello, \"Nazareth is recognized as a versatile and accomplished actress, capable of delivering performances across a wide range of characters.\" During the 1990s, she was particularly acclaimed for her portrayals of maternal roles, and is considered one of the most sought-after actresses for such parts. Nazareth has frequently collaborated with other Konkani singers, participating in duets, trios, and quartet performances. She has also produced her own audio recordings and is regarded for her vocal work on various audio cassette projects. In addition to her work in India, Nazareth has undertaken extensive tours abroad as a tiatrist, or Konkani theater artist.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1977, Nazareth entered into matrimony with Abdon R. Fernandes, a Goan musician widely known as Abbey from Saligão. Abbey had established himself as a film musician, collaborating with Hindi music artists such as Kalyanji-Anandji, Babla & Kanchan, and contributing to the musical performances of Goan musician Chris Perry. Nazareth initially faced opposition from her in-laws concerning her involvement in stage performances, but they ultimately relented and supported her pursuit of a career in acting. She conveys gratitude for the support and encouragement provided by her husband during her endeavors. Juggling the responsibilities of her family and acting profession proved to be a challenge for Nazareth. Her participation in Goan shows often required her to be away from home for extended periods, spanning anywhere from one to two months. \nTo manage childcare, Nazareth relied on the assistance of a maid, and at times, a supportive aunt played a crucial role in providing help. Despite the demanding circumstances, she made various sacrifices to engage in theatrical productions. Commuting between Mumbai and Goa posed logistical challenges, and even during rehearsals, her thoughts revolved around her children. After welcoming her second son, Nazareth temporarily scaled back her acting engagements to focus on her family responsibilities. However, as her children matured, her passion and fervor for the theater reignited, drawing her back to the stage with renewed enthusiasm. As of 2012, Nazareth has established her residence in Bandra West, Mumbai.\nNazareth found herself assuming the role of sole caretaker for her two children, Aaron and Warren, following the death of her husband in 2004, However, since the boys had reached adulthood by then, her stage performances remained unaffected by this personal responsibility. By 2013, Aaron, the firstborn, had obtained a position at an oil rig firm, whereas Warren had entered matrimony and established a stable lifestyle in Canada. Nazareth harbored a single unfulfilled aspiration-to act in a Bollywood movie. Despite this longing, she remained hopeful and refused to abandon her dreams entirely. Nazareth also shed light on the Maharashtra Konknni Kala Saunstha (MKKS) organization, where she serves as a treasurer. MKKS annually organized a range of cultural events, including tiatrs, musical shows, one-act plays, singing competitions, and a mando festival. Nazareth emphasized the importance of preserving and revitalizing Konkani theater, expressing concern over its gradual decline in Mumbai. She called upon the residents of Mumbai, urging them to embrace their native language, Konkani, and support the revival of tiatrs-a once deeply rooted art form.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBetty Naz discography at Discogs",

For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have won more than one quarter of Fields Medals, Turing Awards, and Regeneron Science Talent Search awards. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are also disproportionately represented among world chess champions (54 percent), National Medal of Science recipients (37 percent), U.S. Nobel Prize winners (29 percent), and Nobel laureates in medicine or physiology (42 percent). Furthermore, Jews comprise up to one third of the student populace at Ivy League schools and 30 percent of U.S. Supreme Court law clerks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAshkenormativity\nPhilosemitism\nRacism in Jewish communities\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "UGC 3730 or Arp 141 is a ring galaxy in the constellation Camelopardalis. The galaxy lies about 130 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that UGC 3730 is approximately 110,000 light years across. The galaxy is included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the elliptical galaxies emanating material category.\nUGC 3730 has been the result of galaxy interaction. The interaction has led one galaxy to turn into an asymmetric ring. The companion, a lenticular galaxy, lies along the major axis of the ring and it is estimated to have a larger mass than the ring galaxy. The nucleus of the ring galaxy lies between the ring and companion galaxy. Emission has been observed in the interior of the ring as well as between the ring galaxy and the companion galaxy and stars have been tidally stripped from the ring galaxy. The star formation rate of the ring galaxy is estimated to be 0.26 M☉ per year. The total stellar mass of the galaxy is estimated to be 8.3×109 M☉ and the total gas mass to be 4.9×109 M☉.\nUGC 3730 forms a pair with UGC 3705 which lies 9.4 arcminutes away. Both galaxies are part of the LGG 141 galaxy group, which also includes UGC 3697, UGC 3714, UGC 3804, UGC 3838, UGC 3878, UGC 3626, UGC 3644, and UGC 3701.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUGC 3730 on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen α, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images",

        "content": "Gurban Soltan Achilova or Soltan Açylowa or Gurbansoltan Achilova (born c. 1949) is a Turkmenistani photojournalist. She was a nominee for the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2021. She has been reported as the only openly critical journalist in Turkmenistan. Her country is described as an information black hole that is only surpassed by North Korea.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAchilova was born in 1948, 1949 or 1950. She married and by 1979 they had four children and they lived in a house they owned in Ashgabat. Ashgabat is the capital of Turkmenistan. She may have never come to notice if it was not for the event in March 2006. She was not a journalist.\nShe was out of her house one day and her daughter was at home when workers arrived, without notice, to demolish her family's home. The police assisted in the family's eviction and the authorities offered no compensation for their loss. She contacted the courts and the chief prosecutor's office but instead of finding justice all she found were similar cases of injustice. She became a journalist using her camera to document her findings. She has no access at home to the internet and her country is described as an information black hole that is only surpassed by North Korea.\nIn 2019 she was a contributor to the opposition website Khronika Turkmenistana (hronikatm.com) that had been started in 2006. She was prevented from leaving the country to go to a seminar in Georgia. Enquiries by the Committee to Protect Journalists about why she had been prevented from travelling were not replied to.\nAchilova has been reported as the only openly critical journalist in Turkmenistan. She operates a web site in a country where access to the internet is restricted. Despite this she has 30,000 visits to the site she uses each day (as of 2021). She reports on the human rights abuses in her country. She says that she has been hoping for improvement for thirty years but it does not get better. She says that people who campaign for human rights are watched and they are subject to not only arrest but pressure is also applied to members of their family.\nShe was shortlisted for the 2021 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders together with Loujain al-Hathloul from Saudi Arabia and Yu Wensheng from China. That year's award was given to the lawyer Yu Wenshengs who was serving a four-year sentence in China after deciding to defend the human rights of others. Achilova was the only one of the nominees who was able to address the ceremony as she sent a pre-recorded video. Achilova had not been able to attend in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and her runner-up award remained with them.\nAchilova was in the news again in November 2023 when she was prevented from attending that years Martin Ennals Award ceremony in Geneva. She was held by the authorities in Turkmenistan again as she and her daughter tried to leave on 17 November. She was questioned and strip searched twice but no charges were brought against her. She was still a critic of her country's government and she wanted to collect her award from 2021. The nominal reason given by the border staff for preventing her leaving the country was that their passports were invalid. Commentators concluded that they were trying to prevent her from further highlighting the country's injustices. She was expecting to meet people from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and she had been invited to speak at the University of Geneva during their human rights week.\n\n\n== References ==",

Unfortunately, the young and attractive miller's wife died prematurely. Some said she had exhausted herself through her devotion, while others whispered that the miller, consumed by jealousy, had fatally stabbed her. No funeral tributes were paid. In front of the entrance to the mill, the miller dug a grave to bury his wife. The peasants who crossed the threshold were unaware that they were trampling on the remains of the beautiful miller.

        "revision_id": 1220855462,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "No Rules is the debut and only full-length studio album by American hard rock band Kik Tracee, released in May 1991 through RCA Records. The album produced several singles, including \"You're So Strange\" and \"Don't Need Rules.\" The band's cover version of \"Mrs. Robinson\" by Simon & Garfunkel received moderate success as well. \nAs Kik Tracee was one of the final bands to debut within the glam metal scene, No Rules was one of the final glam metal albums released before glam metal lost mainstream popularity in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Kik Tracee only released one EP after No Rules, 1992's Field Trip, before disbanding in 1993. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nKik Tracee was originally signed to RCA Records after a label representative watched the band perform at the Coconut Teaser venue in Los Angeles; RCA allegedly did not listen to a demo tape from the band before signing them.\nDrummer Johnny Douglas joined the band in the middle of the recording process for No Rules, stating that the band had completed \"two or three songs\" by the time he joined, one being \"Don't Need Rules\" and another being the band's cover of \"Mrs. Robinson\" by Simon & Garfunkel, and that the band was still writing music for No Rules at the same time they were recording some of the album's tracks. Douglas replaced the band's original drummer, Scott Donnell.\nAccording to Douglas, the album was originally supposed to be named after the sixth track on the album, \"Generation Express.\" The album's art, which was designed by Hugh Syme, featured a photograph of a model of a train (which Syme also built) because the train design was intended to match that original album title. Douglas stated that although the band wanted the album to be named Generation Express, their record label did not think the album title sounded \"rock enough,\" requiring the band to change it to No Rules in order to match \"Don't Need Rules,\" which the label planned to release as the album's lead single. Later, in an interview in 2021, Shareaux explained that the \"inspiration behind No Rules\" was the idea of \"just doing things by your own set of rules.\"\n\n\n=== Production and songwriting ===\nThe album was produced by Dana Strum, the bassist for the band Slaughter. In a 1991 interview, Kik Tracee's drummer Johnny Douglas recounted that their label tried to remove Strum from the producing process because of Strum's relatively unknown profile at the time, stating that the label wanted the band to have a more noteworthy and famed producer for name recognition: \"[The label] thought we were crazy for standing by [Strum]. . . . At first, everyone said we were crazy for using a producer no one knew. Then Slaughter broke, and the questions are, 'How'd you get him to produce?' It was ironic.\" However, Strum's touring schedule with Slaughter caused issues with the production process of No Rules, resulting in a recording process that took 11 months to complete. Kik Tracee followed Slaughter as they toured and worked with Strum on his days off, recording in five studios located across three different states.\nDespite the difficulties, Douglas credited Strum with \"[focusing]\" Kik Tracee's sound and music, and he and lead vocalist Stephen Shareaux both stated that the fragmented recording process had positive aspects, as the extra time the band took to record the album caused them to improve their songwriting. Shareaux stated in a 1991 interview, \"You get a clearer perspective this way. We would record, maybe, three or four songs at a time, and when we finished, we had the luxury of time – time to live with the tunes to make sure they were done right.\" Similarly, Douglas said, \"The time between recording and production sessions gave us time to live with the songs and get a clearer perspective. We were actually writing the songs as we were recording the album. Our songwriting improved with time.\" Douglas also credited the extra recording time with helping his chemistry with the band to improve and helping the band to polish their songwriting.\nDouglas noted that the production of No Rules gave the band a \"slick\" sound that he felt was not a complete representation of Kik Tracee's style, which he saw as being somewhere between what No Rules presented, and the aggressive nature of the band's more grunge-oriented followup EP Field Trip from 1992.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\n\n\n=== Promotion ===\nThe band's initial promotion for the album, as proposed by RCA Records, involved the band embarking on an unconventional acoustic tour with several stops in radio stations and bowling alleys. In September 1991, Kik Tracee embarked on a 13-city national tour to promote the album, starting in the Midwest before branching out to cities on the West Coast and East Coast, holding shows in cities including Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Seattle. One of the shows Kik Tracee performed while promoting the album took place at the Florentine Gardens in their hometown of Los Angeles; that show was the venue's all-time largest sold-out show at the time.\n\n\n=== Album sales and singles ===\nThe first single from No Rules was \"Don't Need Rules,\" which received airplay on rock and metal radio stations; its music video circulated on Headbangers Ball on MTV. The second single was \"You're So Strange,\" which had a music video and received airplay on rock radio stations as well. Both videos were directed by Nigel Dick. \"You're So Strange\" peaked at #47 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in September 1991.\nDouglas stated that the band wanted to release the \"Mrs. Robinson\" cover as a single due to a trend of hard rock bands releasing commercially successful covers of older songs but that their record label, RCA, was hesitant to do so and ultimately decided against it.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nNo Rules received generally positive reviews, with several reviewers complimenting Kik Tracee's songwriting, performance, and composition, as well as the band's uniqueness from other hard rock bands at the time, while the album's more mixed reviews found the record derivative.\nIn a positive review for the Calgary Herald, G.M. awarded the album with an A- rating. G.M. complimented Kik Tracee's ability to compose songs with \"great beginnings,\" exciting middle sections, and strong endings. G.M. also complimented Kik Tracee's \"unstructured, carefree approach\" to performing music, pointing out that despite the album's lack of \"melodic and hook-laden\" moments, the album was solid.\nIn another positive review, The Tampa Tribune granted the album 4 out of 5 stars. The reviewer, John Urban, complimented the band for \"composing marketable hard rock without using cliché [sic] lyrics and dated guitar riffs as a crutch.\" Urban singled out Stephen Shareaux's evocative and interesting lyrics, the band's approach to songwriting and structuring in prioritizing \"arranging quality songs [over] trying to prove what guitar gods they are,\" and Shareaux's unique vocal style, as positive aspects of the band's style. Urban complimented Shareaux's singing on \"You're So Strange\" and \"Big Western Sky\" in particular.\nEntertainment Weekly granted the album an A rating. Their reviewer, Janiss Garza, also complimented the band's unique approach to hard rock, calling the band's approach \"exciting musically,\" complimenting the production from Dana Strum, and singling out the cover of \"Mrs. Robinson\" as transformative, as well as complimenting the band's acoustic ballad \"Lost\" for its \"naked sensitivity.\" Garza distinguished \"You're So Strange\" and \"Generation Express\" as additional standout tracks.\nWhile Amplified Edge did not assign the album a formal rating, their review of No Rules called the album a \"hidden gem\" and complimented the band's attempts to distinguish themselves from \"Warrant or Poison or Bon Jovi\" in making a \"fun, quirky rock album that you can't help but enjoy.\" They distinguished \"You're So Strange,\" \"Big Western Sky,\" \"Generation Express,\" \"Velvet Crush,\" and \"Rattlesnake Eyes (Strawberry Jam)\" as standout tracks.\nAllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson awarded the album 3 out of 5 stars, criticizing the band for emulating Guns N' Roses in their style, making an \"ultra-slick\" album, and offering generally \"routine and uninteresting\" material, although Henderson singled out \"Trash City\" and the cover of \"Mrs. Robinson\" as standout tracks.\nIn a more mixed review, the Chicago Tribune granted the album 2 out of 4 stars. Reviewer Brenda Hermann found the first half of the album to be \"structurally unsound\" and criticized \"Big Western Sky\" and \"Trash City\" for being based on \"overused\" tropes in the genre. Hermann singled out \"Generation Express\" as a standout track and stated that the second half of the album was \"adequate.\" Another mixed review from Jonathan Gold, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times, did not assign a star rating, but stated that the album had good features and clichéd features. Gold compared Kik Tracee to Warrant and Jane's Addiction and stated that Kik Tracee's music featured \"sappy hooks, an occasionally interesting bass line, a decent drummer and a singer who cleaves to the Dionysian, depraved-rock-god school of performance but can't really carry a tune.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nIn 2019, Rolling Stone named No Rules the 46th greatest glam metal album of all time.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTrack information and credits adapted from Discogs and AllMusic, then verified from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Adam Gorczyński (1805 – 24 May 1876) was a Polish writer and poet of the Romantic era, author of popular novels in the style of gawęda szlachecka and Old Polish silvae rerum, a painter of the Polish Romantic era, an artist of Polish landscapes, co-founder of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, politically engaged in Polish affairs in Galicia, a social activist, and owner of estates in Brzeźnica and Marcyporęba. He used the literary pseudonym \"Jadam of Zator\". In the 21st century, he became the patron of cultural initiatives in his hometown of Brzeźnica.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born in 1805 in Tarnów as the son of the ennobled lawyer Józef Kalasanty Gorczyński (of his own coat of arms) and Katarzyna Łojowska. In 1818, Józef Kalasanty purchased Brzeźnica, Nowe Dwory, and part of Marcyporęba. Adam's sister Elżbieta was the grandmother of General Józef Haller.\nAdam Gorczyński completed his gymnasium education in Tarnów and then studied philosophy in Lviv. During this time, he established contacts with Ossolineum and became close to a group of Lviv intellectuals – August Bielowski, Ludwik Nabielak, and Stanisław Jaszowski – who were advocates of emphasizing the connections between Polish culture and the history of Slavdom. The cultural and literary atmosphere that the young Gorczyński absorbed during this time was reflected in his later literary works.\nFrom 1821, he pursued \"chamber studies\" in Vienna, which prepared estate managers for large landownership and officials for the Austrian crown lands. Upon his return from Vienna, where he also studied painting, he married and took over the management of the estate in Nowe Dwory. After his father's death in 1830, he permanently moved to Brzeźnica, which he inherited together with part of the nearby Marcyporęba. As a significant landowner in Galicia, he had the right to vote in the estate owners' curia. He died in 1876 and was buried in the cemetery next to the parish church in Marcyporęba.\n\n\n=== Literary work ===\nAdam Gorczyński was a creator of the Polish Romantic era, associated with emigrant literature and Slavophilia, whose development coincided with the period from 1815 (the confirmation of the partitions of Poland by the Congress of Vienna) to 1863 (the fall of the January Uprising). During this time, the paths of European Romanticism were shaped by social changes, and Polish political events defined its distinct national-patriotic character. These characteristics appeared in Polish art until the regaining of independence in 1918, and even until the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.\n\nGorczyński's literary work was characterized by the affirmation of native customs, familiar landscapes, and ancient legends, with its main features being patriotism, regionalism, historicism, and populism. From 1835 to 1845, he was one of the most widely read Polish writers. He first published poetic works in Rozmaitości Lwowskie in 1819. He wrote 21 dramatic works that were performed in theaters in Kraków, Lviv, Warsaw, and Poznań. His son Bronisław published collections of his poems and play texts after the writer's death. Gorczyński printed them earlier in various periodicals such as Sławianin, Rozmaitości, Przyjaciel Ludu, Czas, and Biblioteka Warszawska.Plowing fathers' field,If a hidden legend's yield,String it on our rosary's chain,A spark of old stones, make it plain.Brush against a stone, long ignored,From its depths, a spark restored,To brighten the thoughts of kin,Unearthing tales buried within;If less fortune smiles your way,From hills and huts, a scene to sway,Craft a picture for all to see,In every stroke, our history;Many a capital, our fathers' land,Painted with patterns, hand in hand,Feeds our eyes with beauty's grace,Leaves a mark, in time and space.\n\nCharacteristic of Gorczyński's work were stories akin to gawęda szlachecka. This genre mimicked oral tales, seemingly casual, filled with elaborate digressions and commentary. The themes of these works focused on vignettes from the everyday lives of the old middle-class nobility, and their composition resembled genre scenes. This was a consequence of the similarity the author saw between literature and painting. Among the most popular stories were: Zamek Libusza; Kto się w opiekę poda Panu Swemu; Niedźwiedzica; Górnice; Kwestia o Wilczy Dołek; Żaki; Kapitalik; Syn Chrzestny; Hełm Jaksy; Wróżba Maruchy; Pan Królowej ruskiej; Zwierciadełko; Skała św. Onufrego, czyli kronika szlacheckiego dworku; Kasperek; Straszny strzelec. Some of these stories were translated into Czech and German.\nPowieści Jadama in the form of legends and fairy tales from near Kraków were published in 1838. In 1842, he published in Lviv a collection Opowieści i legendy Jadama z Ziemi Zatorskiej, the extensive review of which was published in the monthly Biblioteka Warszawska, and which became a reading material in 1852 in a Polish high school in Cieszyn. In this collection, he included legends concerning Zakrzów, as well as Nowe Dwory, of which he was the owner. In the same year, he printed Silva Rerum Jadama in the literary form of silva rerum, which was a continuation of Opowieści. He was also the author of two novels of manners – Farmazon (1844) and Zeno (1845).\nGorczyński's books belonged to popular Romanticism, intended for a wide audience. Their content was medieval stories, which the writer developed and embellished with his own imagination. Some of them (e.g., Balice, Zmesta, Hełm Jaksy) were based on fragments of chronicles by Jan Długosz and Marcin Bielski. The action of Gorczyński's historical tales often took place in romantic-gothic scenery, such as dungeons and castles, mysterious caves and abandoned chapels (the story Balice). His illustrated legend Pogoń Tatarów, located in Czorsztyn Castle, was published in 1847.\nHe used the pseudonym \"Jadam of Zator\", emphasizing his affiliation with a specific region, with its own culture and history. This kind of literary mystification, often used in Romanticism, was intended to authenticate the presented works as stories heard from common folk. The basis for these works were legends recorded by Gorczyński during his national wanderings, often with friends – Wincenty Pol, Jan Nepomucen Głowacki, and Leon Dembowski. After the tragic events of the Galician Peasant Uprising, he clearly changed the message of his publications towards organic work.\nHe translated the poems of the Czech poet Václav Hanka. He also engaged in translating the poetry of German romantics Friedrich Schiller and Johann Goethe. He also translated William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which relied on well-known sentimental conventions supplemented with elements of hagiography and gawęda szlachecka. The translation of Romeo and Juliet was not performed in the 19th century. Gorczyński's catalog of works is found in the Estreicher Bibliography. In the extensive monograph Outline of the History of Polish Literature from 1860, dramas authored by him were highly praised: In them (the dramas), uncommon talent shines, there are scenes of wondrous beauty, which he masterfully renders, capturing the spirit of the age brilliantly, yet also alongside this there are flat, unremarkable chambers.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1860s, he ceased his literary activity. A quarter of a century after his death, he was described as a novelist and playwright, once quite renowned, whose works were favorably received because they appeared during a great literary drought in the country and because they seemed to be based on local legends, which were highly valued at the time.\nKarol Estreicher quotes Adam Gorczyński's words from their meeting in Kraków in 1852: I write in moments free from agricultural tasks. (...) Amidst so many literary coryphaeuses, a humble foot soldier cannot advance, and I live out my days peacefully in the countryside, as good God has ordained for me. In a contemporary Polish literature textbook for school use, it was stated in 1866 that he wrote several good novels, among which \"Farmazon\" (1844) stands out. \"Silva rerum\" (1842) is a collection of tales of barren content, but beautifully written in language.\nKraków's Czas in a posthumous tribute in 1876 wrote: Adam Gorczyński belonged to the slim ranks of writers who sought to enliven literary activity amidst the most enduring censorship and complete indifference to books. Józef Ignacy Kraszewski wrote about his novels: One can recognize exceptional talent, and above all, a fair understanding of the past and an understanding of its spirit without prejudice.\nRomanticism initiated a modern national ideology and decisively influenced the adopted worldview and political positions in Poland. The selection of stories and poetry by Adam Gorczyński was published in 2014. A source-based analysis of Gorczyński's works in terms of local history based on the discovered parish archive in Stryszów, where his family were patrons, was published in 2021. In the consciousness of later generations, \"Jadam of Zator\" primarily emerged as a bard of the native areas and a lover of folk legends. He is recognized as a creator on the border between Romanticism and Positivism.\nOn Kmita Rock (in the landscape reserve above the Rudawa canyon in Garb Tenczyński near Kraków), there exists a fragment of his archaic verse, carved in 1854 at the behest of Professor Łepkowski, and at the expense of Count Skórzewski, renewed in 2016:\n\nHe who comes with heart so true,Having courage in that view,Though in joy he finds delight.\nYet he who comes with burdened sigh,Bears sorrows as days pass by,Still, in peace, he may alight.The poetic apotheosis Chleb was republished in 1918. Gorczyński's poem W grudniu! from 1884 was presented in 2020 as an example of a work helpful in educating contemporary students and healthcare workers. It was also noted that poetry of this kind enriches medical professionals and may protect them from occupational burnout.\nIn the heat he lies, sweat on his brow,Doctor's fees beyond him now;Kraków, distant, seems to mock,But Mr. Wróbleski, like a rock,Once visited, a kind grace,Prescribed some medicine to embrace.Will he again, in his plight,Visit the poor man this night?\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\nThe ideological content of Adam Gorczyński's paintings also belonged to Polish Romanticism, in which realistic tendencies dominated, objectively representing reality. During this period, the birth of landscape painting as a separate subject in art occurred. Artists began to paint landscapes as they truly saw them. The characteristic features of this type of landscape were the approach to the subject, attention to detail, delicate lines, uniform texture, and expressive use of color.\n\nGorczyński studied painting in Vienna under the landscape painter Franz Steinfeld (1787–1868), and also in Kraków under Jan Nepomucen Głowacki (1802–1847), who was named in 2016 by the Museum of Romanticism in Opinogóra as the \"father of Polish landscape\". They shared a fascination with the landscapes of Podhale and the Tatra Mountains. Gorczyński authored several hundred paintings in the style of Polish Romanticism, which, like his literary works, had a clear patriotic and independence character in the context of the political situation in partitioned Poland. He depicted society against the backdrop of local landscapes and historical monuments. The most common theme of his paintings were landscapes of his native land.\nFrom his Viennese master, Steinfeld, he adopted an artistic form that originated directly from the 18th-century Alpine painting school, characterized by picturesque scenes, precise framing, and delicate colors. Light was the dominant element of his compositions. These principles corresponded with the assumptions of Polish Biedermeier, promoted by Głowacki – Gorczyński's friend and second mentor. Gorczyński himself was convinced of the correspondence between literature and painting, especially literary landscapes, about which he wrote in three essays: O Janie Nepomucenie Głowackim, artyście krakowskim, i o krajobrazie w obecnym czasie (1862), Obrazki rodzajowe (1855), and Pejzaż (Urywek z myśli o sztuce) (1853).\n\nHe painted in oil and watercolor, mostly landscapes, often with architectural motifs. In the album Galicyja w obrazach, he included 14 lithographs from the surroundings of Krosno, Nowy Sącz, Jasło, Tarnów, Krynica, and the Tatras. The National Museum in Kraków houses his paintings The Road to Morskie Oko in the Tatra Mountains and The Dominican Church in Kraków after the 1850 fire. The Jagiellonian Library has: A View of Sanok, Mountain Landscape, The Herburtów Castle near Dobromil, and the Ossolineum preserves drawings: Czorsztyn – Ruins of the Castle, Czorsztyn, St. Mary's Church in Kraków, Bielany in Kraków, Pieskowa Skała (with the inscription on the back of the drawing: painted from nature by Adam Gorczyński, a student of Steinfeld). In the Podhale Museum in Nowy Targ, there are paintings View of the Tatras and Nowy Targ. He also exhibited his paintings at the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, of which he was a co-founder and long-time board member. Under the pseudonym \"A* of Galicia\", he exhibited in 1854 at the society's salon: A View of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, The Road to Morskie Oko in the Tatra Mountains, A View of the Red Monastery from the Pieniny Mountains and Czarny Dunajec. In 1855, he exhibited Babia Góra at Dawn, Futor Mohort, Mohort Monastery, Czchów, Brzegi Dunajca and Melsztyn. Gorczyński's paintings are present on the art market.\nHe treated both painting and literature as arts which main task is moral and educational influence on the audience. Gorczyński's Romantic sarmatism manifested itself in his fondness for the folklore of western Galicia, local color, idyllic landscapes, and the history of his homeland. He supported young painters interested in Polish landscapes.\nIn the parish church in Bolechowice, there is a painting Madonna with Child, probably by Adam Gorczyński. This painting belonged to the family collection in the Gorczyński manor in Brzeźnica, from where, due to the confiscation of property by the occupying Germans during World War II, it was taken by Adam's grandson Colonel Zygmunt Gorczyński (1881–1962) and in 1943 donated to the parish in Bolechowice.\n\n\n=== Political and social activities ===\n\nFrom the early 1840s, Adam Gorczyński befriended and collaborated with Ludwik Klucki, a lawyer, Slavophile, and politician from Cieszyn, who, despite being Moravian, considered the Polish environment his own. Both were close to the group led by Prince Jerzy Lubomirski, who advocated the idea of unity among Austrian Slavs based on the Habsburg monarchy. In 1848, Gorczyński, along with Father Wacław Wąsikiewicz (1815–1896), a social activist and parson in Radocza, edited the Tygodnik Wiejski in Wadowice, aimed at elevating the sentiments of peasants in the spirit of social solidarity in the aftermath of the Galician Peasant Uprising of 1846. In 1848, he was elected as the president of the Wadowice National Council and in this capacity participated in the Prague Slavic Congress.\nHe published texts on current social and political topics in the Dziennik Mód Paryskich (English: Paris Fashion Journal), a publication in Lviv during the 1840s–1849s, whose title was a misleading camouflage for Austrian censorship vigilance. From 1848, he was an active member of the Galician Agricultural Society. He belonged to the Kraków Agricultural Society. From 1855 to 1856, he was the president of the Galician Forestry Society. Since 1850, he was the conservator of monuments in the Wadowice and Bochnia districts. He initiated a public fundraiser for a monument to his friend Wincenty Pol (1807–1872), a poet and geographer. In 1854, he was a co-founder of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts. In 1876, he founded an elementary school in Brzeźnica and an agricultural school in Czernichów. He was also a patron of the church in Marcyporęba.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nDuring the German occupation, the manor in Brzeźnica, along with the entire estate, was seized by the Germans (1940) from its then owner, Adam's grandson Zygmunt Gorczyński (1881–1962), a retired colonel in the Polish Army, who had previously served as a major in the Austrian cavalry. The manor in Brzeźnica was left in ruins after the war by various occupants, and the monument at Adam Gorczyński's grave was dismantled in the early 1970s.\nForgotten for years, Adam Gorczyński returned to collective memory. In 2012, an updated study of Gorczyński's work was published, which led to his selection as an extraordinary figure of spiritual life from our region as the patron of the painting exhibition Charming Monuments of the Carp Valley in Tomice near Wadowice. Thanks to subsequent local initiatives, the Municipal Public Library in Brzeźnica published the monograph Romantyk z Brzeźnicy in 2014, which also included a selection of Adam Gorczyński's literary works. On 29 May 2015, in the former granary in Brzeźnica, the only remaining relic of the Gorczyński family estate, now the Municipal Grainhouse of Books, which has been completely modernized, the first edition of the Adam Gorczyński Provincial Recitation Competition took place. In the same year, on October 14, the name of Adam Gorczyński was given to the Junior High School (School and Kindergarten Complex) in Brzeźnica, as well as to one of the streets. Recitation competitions continued to be held in the granary in subsequent years.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdam Gorczyński's works on Polona.pl",

Originating in the 1890s as a founding unit of the Sudan Defence Force, the Eastern Arab Corps was spearheaded by Beni Amer tribesmen of the Eastern Sudan. The insignia of the Eastern Arab Corps was the Shotal, a famous curved dagger used in Eastern Sudan.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nWith bases strategically located in Kassala and Gedaref, the Eastern Arab Corps was composed of infantry, mounted (horseback and camel company), and machine gun units to address a range of military challenges. The Eastern Arab Corps operated with two distinct sub-units, the Idara and Hagana. These units undertook missions ranging from maintaining internal order in the country, patrolling the borders with neighbouring nations and actively participating in international warfare such as the East African campaign. During World War II, the Eastern Arab Corps was involved in warfare on the global stage, as it actively took part in the East African campaign against the Italians. The opening days of the conflict belongs to the Eastern Arab Corps as it was staged in their country, and the opening blows were rightly theirs to strike.\n\n\n== References ==",

The ruins are listed as a historic monument.\nThe château was known as the Versailles of Normandy. In addition, the gardens were one of the first in the English landscape style in France, and were well-known and admired.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe ruins of the château are situated on the bank of the Orne, which traverses its park, 350 meters northwest of the Saint-Sauveur church in the village of Thury-Harcourt.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Middle Ages: the barony of Thury ===\nSince the Middle Ages, Thury had a castle, likely dating back to the 11th century when the Norman baron Raoul II Tesson du Cinglas was Lord of Thury. In 1046, he becomes involved in a plot to assassinate the young Duke of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, before switching allegiances.\nThe Tesson family is succeeded by the Crespin family, when Jeanne Tesson married Jean Crespin. Their granddaughter, Blanche Crespin inherits the barony and marries Pierre de Préaux. Around 1367, their daughter marries Jacques de Bourbon-Préaux, who is the ‘grand bouteiller de France’, which is one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France. As they have no children, the barony of Thury returns to the Préaux family. They are again succeeded by the Ferrières and Amount families.\n\n\n=== 16th century: the Montmorency family ===\nIn 1522, the Montmorency family becomes owner when Anne d’Aumont married Claude de Montmorency, lord of Fosseux. The barony is elevated to a marquisate for their son, Pierre I, in 1578. Succession continues through Pierre I's son, Anne, who passes in 1592, followed by his grandson, Pierre II, who passes in 1615, and great-grandson, François (1614–1686).\n\n\n=== 17th century: The Harcourt family comes to Thury ===\nIn the 17th century, the Hartcourt family enters the history of Thury, when in 1635, Odet d'Harcourt acquires the marquisate of Thury. He decides to construct a new château in Thury. This is the oldest part of the building and forms the main façade to the courtyard.\n\n\n=== 1st Duke of Harcourt: Creation of the Norman Versailles ===\nOdet's grandson, Henri d’Harcourt sells Thury to another Henri d’Harcourt (1654–1718), then marques of Beuvron. He was a successful military commander, who was appointed extraordinary ambassador to Spain in 1697. It were turbulent times as king Charles II of Spain (1661–1700) had no children and died without a direct heir. It is unknown which role Harcourt played in the intrigues following Charles's death, but it resulted in a French Bourbon on the throne: Philip V. When he returned to France, the grateful king Louis XIV created him the first duke of Harcourt in 1700 and Marshal of France in 1703.\nThe first duke undertook the expansion of the château by adding a long wing overlooking the Orne river. The wing was covered by a mansard roof. Also, a chapel was added on the courtyard side of this wing. Interrupted by the death of the duke, the works were completed by his widows, Marie Anne Claude Brulart de Genlis, who installed her apartments at the north end of this new wing.\n\n\n=== 18th century: the 5th Duke of Harcourt and the creation of an English landscape garden ===\nDuring the 18th century, the château remains with the dukes of Harcourt, who are often also the governors of Normandy.\nFrançois-Henri d'Harcourt (1726–1802), the 5th duke of Harcourt, served in the King's army, distinguished himself in the  and in the end, he is promoted to lieutenant-general in 1762. Also, he works in the administration of Normandy and ultimately inherits his father's office in 1776, governor of Normandy. But the ultimate achievement was being appointed in 1786 as governor of the Dauphin of France, Louis-Joseph. His great passion were gardens, on which he wrote a book advocating the English landscape-style. But he not only wrote about it, he also put into practice. On the other side of the valley, opposite of the château, he created a vast English landscape-style park, a testing ground and laboratory for his garden theories and ideas.\nOn the night of 21 June 22 June 1786, king Louis XVI and his entourage stayed at château in Thury-Harcourt during their journey to Cherbourg. Coming from Falaise, they were received by the duke and duchess of Harcourt, dined there, and then resumed their journey in the morning to Caen.\nDuring the French Revolution, François Henri d'Harcourt emigrated to England. His estates including the château were confiscated. In England, he served king Louis XVIII as ambassador-in-exile and died in the village of Staines-upon-Thames, north of London. His grandchildren managed to regain possession of the domain in the early 19th century. As the fifth duke had no sons, it were his grandchildren through his daughter, who was married to duke of Mortemart.\n\n\n=== 19th century: return of the dukes of Harcourt ===\nUpon the death of the daughter of the Duchess of Mortemart, the Princess of Beauvau, in 1854, her children sold the château and the family treasures it contained in 1856 to their cousin, Eugène d'Harcourt (1786–1865), the 8th duke of Harcourt. So, the château returned to the Harcourt family, and the 8th duke's descendants have retained it since.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nAt the beginning of 1940, about fifty objects from the château, already classified as historical monuments, furniture, artworks, and family souvenirs, were transferred to the Château de Carrouges as a precaution.\nOn 12 August 1944, the British 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division reached the outskirts of Thury-Harcourt. At the same moment, soldiers from the retreating 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich set the château and the village afire to leave a smoke screen behind. The castle and its treasures vanished amidst the inferno, along with over 150 paintings and a library containing over 15,000 books. Also, a significant part of the archive of the Harcourt family was lost.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nThe Harcourt family decided not to reconstruct the château, except for the chapel. Besides this, only the ruins of the main façade (17th century) remain including the courtyard, accessed by a drawbridge flanked by two guard pavilions, overlooking dry moats.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Interior (before 1944) ===\nInside the château, there were the following rooms and halls:\n\nThe vast entrance vestibule with its sculpted décor and marble flooring. In the 18th century, the dining room was on its north side. On its south side, it was occupied by the main staircase, made of stone with a Louis XIV style wrought iron railing. Facing the entrance door, a niche contained a statue of King Louis XIV.\nThe Marshal's Hall, in the south wing, a long and spacious room panelled with natural wood, adorned with large equestrian portraits of various Marshals of France from the Harcourt lineage.\nThe salon known as the \"Ladies of Harcourt,\" also adorned with natural wood panelling, with a series of portraits representing different women of the Harcourt family under the French ceiling cornice.\nA boudoir adorned with white lacquered wood panelling, displaying, among other things, two portraits by Fragonard of the 5th Duke of Harcourt and his brother, the Duke of Beuvron.\nThe Governors' Salon, adorned with natural wood Louis XIV style panelling, displaying portraits of several prominent figures from the Harcourt lineage.\nThe dining room, adorned with paintings above the doorways depicting the estate from various perspectives in the 18th century.\nThe red salon, adorned with several family portraits.\nThe staircase leading to the first floor, decorated with eight large paintings depicting the story of Joseph, painted under Louis XIV.\nThe room where King Louis XVI spent the night on his way to Cherbourg in 1786, furnished with Jouy fabric adorned with island birds.\nThe boudoir adorned with white lacquered wood panelling, displaying eight arched-shaped paintings depicting scenes from the 18th century. Each of these eight paintings was topped by a medallion painting depicting a bouquet of flowers. These eight arched-shaped paintings survived the 1944 fire and were exhibited in the 1970s at the Château du Champ de Bataille.\n\n\n== Park: an English-landscape style garden ==\n\nFrançois-Henri d'Harcourt, 5th Duke of Harcourt, was passionated about gardens. In 1774, he published Traité de la décoration des dehors, des jardins et des parcs, a book advocating English landscape style. He used his ancestral château in Thury-Harcourt as testing ground for his theories and ideas. The Orne river splits the valley at Thury in two. On the right bank is the château. And on an opposite hill, on the left bank, the duke created a vast landscape garden. As the park was one of the first in France, it became a must-visit destination for anyone interested in the latest garden styles.\nThe park rivalled in charm and fame with the garden created by René de Girardin in Ermenonville. The writer Jean Baptiste Claude Delisle de Sales dedicated a poem to it. On 23 August 1788, the British agronomist Arthur Young visited the park, which he then described as \"the most beautiful English garden in France\".\nThe garden was for the 5th duke also a means of showing his pride in the English links of the Harcourt family. His English cousin, Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt, (1714–1777), British ambassador to the French court from 1768 to 1772 remodelled his country seat, Nuneham House, and created a large landscape garden as well, including a model village.\nThe duke later created another garden in his estate in Chaillot near Paris. Also, he created a garden at the château of Betz for Maria Caterina Brignole (1737–1813), Princess of Monaco by marriage to Prince Honoré III.\n\nThe hill's amenities included groves of rare trees, antique-style garden structures, and paths, all providing artistic viewpoints. This part of the park was accessible from the château by boat and by a specially built footbridge over the Orne.\nFrom the French Revolution onwards, the park was left without maintenance. In 1831, groves of trees and a beautiful Lebanese cedar were still visible on the hill. The 18th-century park arrangements are now difficult to perceive.\nDamaged by the 1944 battles, which partly destroyed the nearby town of Thury-Harcourt, the park was redesigned after the war by the 11th Duke of Harcourt. Near the fantasy pavilion, flower gardens were created on three successive terraces in the vast park descending to the Orne.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSoulange-Bodin, Henri (1928).

        "content": "Annie Alice Crisp  (1854 – 11 June 1953) was an English-born nurse who established New Zealand's first school of nursing and served as superintendent of Auckland Hospital, in New Zealand. She also established Winnipeg Children's Hospital, in Canada.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCrisp was born to a farming couple in Warwickshire, England, and completed her nursing training at Queen's Hospital, Birmingham. She joined the nursing section of the British Army and served as a nurse in the Anglo-Zulu and Anglo-Egyptian wars, and in the Sudan and South Africa. She was decorated in each of these campaigns, being awarded the Egypt Medal and the Khedive's Star. \nWhile Crisp was serving overseas, her father became unwell in England and he and his wife emigrated to New Zealand in search of a better climate for him. Crisp travelled from South Africa to New Zealand to join her parents. She settled in Auckland, where she established New Zealand's first school of nursing and was appointed superintendent of Auckland Hospital. In August 1883, Crisp was awarded the Royal Red Cross for her military nursing service; the medal was presented by Governor William Jervois at a ceremony at Government House, Auckland, the following April. \nIn 1888, Crisp married a medical doctor from England, John Bond, and the couple moved to the United States in 1890. Crisp's husband worked on the British exhibit at Chicago's 1893 Worlds Fair. In 1903, the couple settled in Winnipeg, Canada. Crisp became aware of the high child mortality rate in the city and began to campaign for the opening of a children's hospital. In 1909, she founded a hospital on Beaconsfield Street that later became the Winnipeg Children's Hospital.\nCrisp died at Winnipeg Children's Hospital and was buried in the St John's Cathedral cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

His most famous works were for the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKuzginov's father, Mikhail Vasilievich Kuzginov, was a provincial Russian teacher. Upon his death, Kuzginov's family moved to Moscow. In the pre-WWII years, Kuzginov completed a training course with the Factory and Plant Vocational School and worked as a smith. He maintained an interest in the arts, further finishing a course with the fine arts studio at the Zuev Club, a course affiliated with the Malyutin Factory for admission to university, and then the Moscow Art College.\nIn 1941, Kuzginov was drafted into the Soviet army. Kuzginov was athletic and had a history of wrestling, and so he joined the Stalin Institute's sports department, and later the Arzamas Machine Gun and Mortar Cadet College, where he taught physical training. Serving later with the Second Byelorussian Army, he ended the war in Stettin as a lieutenant.\nPost-war, he collaborated with many Moscow publishing houses, also joining the Moscow Union of Artists. In 1948, Kuzginov started working with the All-Union Chamber of Commerce, producing many panels for international exhibitions in Germany, France, Italy, Finland, and India. Kuzginov designed brochures, catalogues, and worked with the monthly magazines \"Znanie-Sila”, \"Murzilka”. He also designed posters, with six of them sent to the 4th and 6th World Festivals of Youth and Students. In particular, he is noted as the designer of the logo for the latter ever, known as the Festival Daisy, which was approved by the Vienna Congress of the World Federation for Democratic Youth for all later forums.\nKuzginov was elected in 1958 as a People's Deputy from the Sverdlovsk District Council of Moscow.\nOne of his daughters, Lyubov Konstantinovna Azhaeva-Borisova, is also an artist working with painting and graphic media.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Good Little Asian\" is the second episode of the American historical black comedy drama miniseries The Sympathizer, based on the novel of the same name by Viet Thanh Nguyen. The episode was written by series creators Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar and Naomi Iizuka, and directed by Park. It originally aired on HBO on April 21, 2024, and was also available on Max on the same day.\nThe series is based on the story of the Captain, a North Vietnam plant in the South Vietnam army. He is forced to flee to the United States with his general near the end of the Vietnam War. While living within a community of South Vietnamese refugees, he continues to secretly spy on the community and report back to the Viet Cong, struggling between his original loyalties and his new life. In the episode, the Captain and Bon start their life in America, while the Captain continues spying and sending messages to Man.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.105 million household viewers and gained a 0.02 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Park's directing, performances and writing.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the North Vietnam re-education camp, the Captain (Hoa Xuande) is brought before a superior officer to continue his confession.\nAt the airfield, the Captain and Bon (Fred Nguyen Khan) run towards the plane, carrying the bodies of Bon's wife and baby. Despite the weight, they manage to get on the plane and leave Saigon. After fleeing Vietnam, the Captain, Bon and the refugees stay at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, with the Captain sending letters to Man (Duy Nguyễn), who now lives in Hanoi. Amidst poor conditions, the General (Toan Le) fails to calm the refugees, and is often humilliated for his failure in maintaining peace. The Captain and Bon are allowed to leave the camp for Los Angeles when they receive sponsorship from Professor Hammer (Robert Downey Jr.), an Orientalist grad school professor. The Captain is taken aback by Hammer's behavior, but becomes infatuated with his secretary, Sofia Mori (Sandra Oh), soon developing a sexual relationship with her.\nSometime later, the General finally moves to Los Angeles with his wife and daughter, settling at a poorly dilapidated house. To build trust with the South Vietnamese community, he decides to open a liquor store. The General shares his concerns with the Captain that there might be a mole in his squad, alarming the Captain. The Captain meets up with the General and Claude (Downey Jr.), and both laugh over a rumor that the Captain might be the mole. When questioned over why he did not get the General out earlier, Claude tells the Captain that he wanted him to take a liking to America and be grateful for his new life opportunity. The Captain also struggles in living with Bon, who is angry that he is having sex in their apartment in front of his family's photographs. The Captain shares his suspicion that he should give Major Oahn out as the mole, and Bon offers to help him.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe episode was written by series creators Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar and Naomi Iizuka, and directed by Park. It was Park's second writing credit, McKellar's second writing credit, Iizuka's first writing credit, and Park's second directing credit.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nHoa Xuande said that the episode wanted to explore the ignorance of America during the Vietnam War, particularly over \"sides within that conflict.\" He said that the interview scene \"is very telling of how the narrative of the Vietnam War has been very one-sided, very Western-centric for such a long time.\"\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nDespite not having enough time to prepare, Sandra Oh and Hoa Xuande didn't struggle in building chemistry for their characters' sexual relationship. Oh explained, \"For me as an actor, chemistry is about being able to listen. You're able to listen, you're able to follow and you know how to play tennis. You know how to dance. Hoa is in, I think, every single scene of the show so he didn't have any time to kind of hang out. So it was just about being an open and willing fellow actor to really listen and be willing to dance.\" \n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Viewers ===\nThe episode was watched by 0.206 million viewers, earning a 0.04 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale. This means that 0.04 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 28% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 0.206 million viewers with a 0.04 in the 18-49 demographic.\n\n\n=== Critical reviews ===\n\"Good Little Asian\" received positive reviews from critics. Tom Philip of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"B\" grade and wrote, \"The first episode of The Sympathizer felt, in many ways like a prologue. That's doubled down in episode two, where the plot starts growing tendrils that won't bloom for another few weeks and our major players are brought more firmly into focus. I said the series premiere had an air of “previously on” about it, and while the pacing of the scenes in episode two remains rapid, “Good Little Asian” lays down the groundwork for the next few hours of storytelling.\" \nTerry Nguyen of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"The second episode swiftly departs from the mood of heightened melodrama that colored the last climactic scene. It is better paced and more tonally consistent than the premiere, with just the right amount of explanatory voiceover.\" \nFletcher Peters of The Daily Beast wrote, \"The Sympathizer has touched down in America. Following the end of last week's premiere episode, Captain is now Stateside, having barely made it onto the airplane out of Vietnam as Saigon fell.\" Josh Rosenberg of Esquire wrote, \"It's a decent save until the General orders him to kill the presumably innocent Major. Kill a guy for handing out candy? Maybe it’s time for the Captain to figure out how to transition out of the spy game.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Good Little Asian\" at IMDb",

        "content": "Gary Herbert Lyman is an American academic hematologist, medical oncologist, and cancer researcher.\nLyman is most known for his efforts in managing the adverse effects of cancer treatment including neutropenia and thrombosis among other toxicities along with establishing the clinical application of colony-stimulating factors and oral anticoagulants. He has also led efforts to address rising health care costs through national policy initiatives, clinical practice guidelines and the clinical integration of biosimilars and other approaches to reducing the financial burden of cancer on patients. His contributions extend to the development and validation of risk prediction models and the application of biomarkers for molecularly targeted therapies. Among his authored works are his publications in academic journals as well as books such as Comprehensive geriatric oncology, Breast cancer : Translational Therapeutic Strategies, Cancer Supportive Care: Advances in Therapeutic Strategies, and Hematopoietic Growth Factors in Oncology. He is a Distinguished Emeritus member of the American Society of Hematology as well as the recipient of the Statesman Award from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\n\n== Education ==\nLyman earned his B.A. in 1968 from the State University of New York at Buffalo, followed by a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1972 from the same institution.

In 2004, he co-edited a book titled Comprehensive Geriatric Oncology with Balducci and others. The book provided a review of the effects of age on tolerance of cancer treatments, prevention, treatment strategies, while also analyzing major clinical trials and addressing emerging issues in geriatric oncology, pain control, supportive care, and rehabilitation for elderly cancer patients. His 2007 book Breast Cancer: Translational Therapeutic Strategies serves as a guide covering translational breakthroughs in breast cancer research, including strategies and agents impacting early detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, with a focus on improved patient selection for evolving therapies. His 2008 book Cancer Supportive Care: Advances in Therapeutic Strategies highlighted advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer and cancer treatment related complications. In 2009, his edited work Oxford American Handbook of Oncology was published. The book provides an overview of cancer care, including information on various types of cancer, treatment choices, algorithms, guidelines, and references. Moreover, his 2011 book Hematopoietic Growth Factors in Oncology focused on advancements in supportive care for cancer patients, particularly in managing hematologic toxicities resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy, covering topics such as hematopoietic growth factors and their clinical utilization based on evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn his early research Lyman investigated how aprotic solvents and divalent cations affect the stability of phospholipid membranes and their correlation with the differentiation of Friend leukemia cells in vitro. In 1980, his RCT investigated the potential of lithium carbonate supplementation to reduce infectious complications and improve outcomes in patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy for small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma. The study demonstrated favorable effects on neutropenia, febrile episodes, infection-related hospitalizations, and blood cell parameters. While lithium proved too toxic, it was associated with increased production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) found to be effective clinically in collaboration with J Crawford and others.\nIn a 1985 study, Lyman and his team reported an association between radium groundwater contamination and the incidence of leukemia in Florida. In 1987 he testified before the US Congress on the risk of indoor radon and the importance of radon testing in homes.\nIn a 1996 study, along with DS Reintgen, C Cox and others, Lyman demonstrated through a prospective trial that lymphatic mapping in invasive breast cancer accurately identifies sentinel lymph nodes, offering potential benefits for staging accuracy and focused histologic examination. His 2001 collaborative study with C M Balch and others presented AJCC's proposed revisions to melanoma staging based on extensive analysis of data from multiple cancer centers. The study identified key prognostic factors such as tumor thickness, ulceration, nodal involvement, and metastasis type to improve the accuracy of staging and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma. His 2005 research in collaboration with AE Giuliano and others advocated for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) as the preferred option over routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for early-stage breast cancer patients with negative axillary nodes, stressing its safety, accuracy, and the necessity of ALND if metastases are found.\nIn 2008, with colleagues including AA Khorana, NM Kuderer, and others, Lyman and his team developed and presented a predictive model for chemotherapy-associated venous thromboembolism in cancer outpatients based on five clinical and laboratory variables. Furthermore, his 2020 joint study led by NM Kuderer, he provided important insights into the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with cancer and identified factors associated with mortality, providing valuable information for clinical management and future research. In his later work with NM Kuderer and others, he provided a review of chemotherapy-associated adverse events, discussing their biological mechanisms, available treatment strategies, evidence-based guidelines, risk factors, validated assessment tools, and emerging supportive-care opportunities for cancer patients and survivors.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1972 – Bernhardt and Sophie B.

        "content": "NGC 3445 is a Magellanic spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy lies about 75 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 3445 is approximately 35,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 8, 1793.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe galaxy is included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the one-armed spiral galaxies category. The galaxy has a thick arm pattern with many HII regions. A large spiral arm is visible at the south part of the galaxy while a weaker one is visible in infrared at the north. Radio emission is observed along the arms. At the end of the main spiral arm there is a smaller galaxy, lying 1.2 arcminutes from the nucleus of NGC 3445, connected with a weak bridge.\nIn the infrared are visible four bright locations of active star formation. The brightest of these infrared knots hosts five young massive star clusters, all being formed by a single giant molecular cloud. The age of the clusters was determined to be 3 to 5 million years and their mass to be around 105 M☉. Another large star cluster lies at the nucleus of the galaxy and could be in the process of forming a bulge. The total star formation rate of the galaxy is estimated to be around 1 M☉ per year. The star formation as well as the shape of the galaxy could be the result of interaction with other galaxies.\n\n\n== Nearby galaxies ==\nNGC 3445 forms a triplet with NGC 3440, which lies 9.9 arcminutes away, and NGC 3458, which lies 14 arcminutes away. These galaxies comprise the LGG 226 group.

        "content": "The Mausoleum of Gasr Doga is an ancient mausoleum dating from the first century CE, located near Tarhuna, Libya.\nThe mausoleum, dubbed \"one of the most imposing funerary monuments of ancient Tripolitania\", was built by a member of the local Libyco-Punic elite, and its architectural composition evokes the style of royal Numidian monuments. Its decorative elements reflect a fusion of local artistic traditions and imported motifs from Italy.\nDuring Late Antiquity and the Islamic era, the mausoleum became the nucleus of a fortified settlement, predominantly built using spolia sourced from the mausoleum itself.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Gasr Doga mausoleum is situated within the Tarhuna Gebel, a fertile area characterized by its hilly terrain, located approximately 60 kilometers southwest of the ancient city of Leptis Magna.\nThe mausoleum sits atop a limestone terrace overlooking the Wadi Doga, approximately 900 meters northwest of the ancient remains of Medina Doga. Medina Doga, likely identified as Mesphe from historical records, has yet to undergo formal excavation. Surrounding discoveries include underground tombs, indicating that the site has been inhabited since at least the first century BC.\nBoundary stones found nearby indicate that both Gasr Doga and Medina Doga were located in a contested frontier between the territories of Leptis and Oea (modern Tripoli), an area that witnessed disputes and raids in the first century AD.\n\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe mausoleum of Gasr Doga likely belonged to a wealthy member of the local Libyco-Punic elite. Situated near Leptis' territory, this individual benefited from Romanization and gained political influence. During the construction of Gasr Doga, the nearby Gebel Tarhuna area was connected to Leptis through a road built under Aelius Lamia's proconsulate. This connection with the coast boosted the Tarhuna area's prosperity by facilitating connections and trade with the Roman state.\nWhile the coastal elite invested in public buildings, Gasr Doga's owner showcased their wealth through this monumental funerary structure. The architectural style, influenced by Hellenistic and Italian designs, suggests ties to the Mediterranean coastal region. However, Gasr Doga's distinctive blend of styles and large scale reflect the burial practices of the Numidian culture, which borrowed from Hellenistic traditions. The mausoleum influenced later Tripolitanian funerary structures, including temple tombs like Gasr el-Banat and Ghirza tomb North A.\n\n\n=== Late Antiquity and Islamic rule ===\nIn later periods, the mausoleum of Gasr Doga evolved into a fortified watchtower surrounded by a village and a defensive ditch. The materials originally used to construct the mausoleum were repurposed for building houses and defensive walls. The pottery found in the village dates from the fourth to the twelfth centuries AD, suggesting a long period of occupation. Among the discoveries are fragments of late Tripolitanian Red Slip Ware and a fifth-century bronze coin.\nThe summit of the village, likely used as a granary since the early Islamic period, may have been accessed through a tower situated on the eastern wing of the façade. Notable structures within the village include a well-preserved room with two aisles and remnants of a defensive circuit, hinting at the presence of a gate.\nThe podium's surface is covered with graffiti, ranging from contemporary Arabic inscriptions to older figurative drawings that depict hunting scenes. Dating back to the fifth to twelfth centuries AD, these drawings reveal the artistic expression of the local Libyco-Berber culture, which is otherwise scarce in figurative representation.\nThe Arabic term \"gasr\", commonly used in North Africa to denote mausoleums, translates to \"castle\" or \"fortified structure,\" fittingly describing the site's transformation from a mausoleum to a fortified watchtower after classical antiquity.\n\n\n=== Modern research ===\nGasr Doga first attracted the attention of European scholars during the 19th century, drawing visits from several notable travelers. In 1817, William H. Smyth documented his observations of the site, followed by Heinrich Barth's visit in 1849, Gerhard Rohlfs in 1887, Henry S. Cowper in 1897, and Federico Minutilli in 1912. These travelers provided early descriptions of the mausoleum and the surrounding structures, which appeared to be in better condition at the time than they are today. Barth's accounts, in particular, offer detailed insights, including the first published image of the site.\nIn the early 20th century, Salvatore Aurigemma extensively documented the mausoleum, aided by Luigi Turba, whose illustrations formed the foundation of Aurigemma's 1954 publication on the subject. Further study seasons were conducted from 1999 to 2001 as part of research projects led by the Archaeological Mission of the Roma Tre University, under the direction of Prof. Luisa Musso.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe mausoleum of Gasr Doga is distinguished by its impressive dimensions. Measuring 16 meters in length, 11 meters in width, and reaching a height of 9 meters, it commands attention with its imposing presence. Constructed entirely from two types of local stone sourced from nearby wadi banks, the mausoleum exhibits a combination of greyish limestone and yellowish limestone. The greyish limestone, with its fine-grained texture, is used extensively throughout the structure for its durability and suitability for detailed carving. In contrast, the lighter yellowish limestone is employed in specific areas, although it is more susceptible to erosion.\nThe mausoleum's architectural layout is characterized by a unique U-shaped design, created by adding wings to a rectangular structure. This design choice gives the mausoleum a distinct façade on its short, southern side, breaking up its otherwise cubic appearance.\nThe podium, resting on a platform of four steps, consists of two superimposed storeys constructed in ashlar masonry. The lower storey measures 3.45 meters in height, while the upper storey stands at 2.9 meters. Both storeys feature socles at the bottom, cornices at the top, and shallow angle pilasters at the corners. Traces of a colonnaded portico that once crowned the podium are still visible, with alternating projecting blocks serving as pedestals for column bases.\nFurthermore, the mausoleum includes underground funerary chambers accessible from the façade. A short flight of steps leads to a shaft, granting access to a series of corridors and vaulted chambers, which are identical in shape and size.\nVarious architectural elements, such as column bases and capitals, from the third storey are now dispersed around the mausoleum. The column bases lack plinths, indicating an early date, and exhibit similarities with those from the Macellum at Leptis Magna, suggesting a comparable design. The capitals feature a cylindrical kalathos adorned with acanthus leaves, displaying characteristics typical of early first-century Corinthian examples. Despite some awkwardness in their execution, they reflect a blend of local and imported influences, possibly from southern Italy. Additionally, other decorative blocks found nearby suggest the repurposing of materials from different structures, indicating a mix of local tradition and foreign models in Gasr Doga's architectural decoration.\n\n\n== Inscription ==\nTwo limestone blocks found at Gasr Doga in 1995 and 1999 likely belong to the same structure, possibly an entablature. They are distinguished by their grey limestone material, with a pink patina, and feature a Neo-Punic inscription prominently displayed on a projecting band at the top. Block 1, which forms a right angle, has a partially preserved inscription with two lines, while Block 2, though more damaged, preserves a single line that matches the beginning of Block 1's inscription. If connected to the mausoleum, the inscription may point to the importance of the architectural project and the person for whom it was erected.\nThe inscription, skillfully crafted in a monumental Neo-Punic script, probably includes a mention of Roman chronology and perhaps the name of the individual associated with the structure or a deity. Interpreting the inscription presents challenges, as it could signify anything from a dedication to the deceased to a votive inscription for a temple. Given its length, estimated to be at least 4 meters, it likely spanned a significant portion of the structure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLibyco-Punic Mausoleum of Dougga – a Libyco-Punic mausoleum in Tunisia\n\n\n== References ==",

He is immortalized in the drawings of Napoleon Orda.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1782–1783, the owners of Kolodne, the Świejkowski family, built a palace on the site of the castle.\n\n...there is not a trace of the ancient castle of the Ostrogski princes in Kolodne. The landowner's palace, built by Świejkowski, stands on the ramparts that survived. A wide, shady and majestic chestnut alley leads to it. There is a nice garden.\nUntil 1914, the hetman's mace and the private correspondence of Polish King John III Sobieski were kept in a special hiding place in the estate.\nIn 1939, a five-year school, a village council, and a road department were opened in the old building. In 1941, it was owned by a German. In August 1943, the palace was burned down.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe estate had 36 rooms and three entrances. A park was planted around it, a greenhouse and a greenhouse were built.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n(in Ukrainian) Уніят, В., Колодне // Ternopil region.

The organization was formed in 2010 as the Taiwanese branch of the International Socialist Alternative (ISA) as the Taiwanese Socialist Alliance (台湾社会主义者同盟). The name later changed to Workers' International Committee Taiwan (工人国际委员会台湾), before adopting its current name on November 12, 2016, when it was officially founded. The organization broke from the ISA on March 13, 2021, and claims to be the only anti-capitalist revolutionary socialist political organization in Taiwan.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe organization believes Taiwanese statehood cannot be achieved through reliance on the Pan-Green Coalition, and must be led by the working class. Through this leadership, the Taiwanese people will unite with the Chinese people, overthrowing the one-party state and capitalism, achieving true independence. This independent, socialist Taiwan will become part of the Asian Socialist Federation. The organization also believes Taiwanese politics are monopolized by the Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang, two bourgeoisie parties, and that the working class must found their own party.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n國際社會主義前進International Socialist Forward on Facebook\nOfficial website",

With an apparent size of 0.95 by 0.35 arcmin, IC 3505 has an estimated diameter of 170,000 thousand light-years, making it slightly larger compared to the Milky Way. It is categorized as a LINER galaxy with an active galactic nucleus emitting weak emission-lines.\nIC 3505 was discovered by Royal Harwood Frost on May 7, 1904. According to Frost when he saw the object for the first time, he listed it as a type SBc at Right Ascension \"12 34 10.3\" and Declination \"+15 58 07\". Despite being listed in the Virgo Cluster catalogue as VCC 1542, it is not part of the Virgo Cluster but a background galaxy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Caritas Switzerland (German: Caritas Schweiz, French: Caritas Suisse, Italian: Caritas Svizzra, Romansh: Caritas Svizra) is a Swiss Catholic not-for-profit organisation. Its mission is to prevent, combat and alleviate poverty.\nIt is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginning and wars ===\nIn 1901, a \"section\" for Caritas was founded within the Swiss Catholic Association (Schweizer Katholikenverein), modelled on the German Caritas Association, established four years prior. It brought together several Swiss associations but was not able to truly unite the various social charitable organisations and associations in Swiss Catholicism into a whole. Fr. Rufin Steimer (1866–1928) was the first president.\nAfter the First World War, in 1919, the central Caritas office in Lucerne was established. It organised the Catholic aid activities for war-affected Europe, in particular children's aid. The Caritas association was legally registered in 1927 and finally brought together all associations and institutions that were active in Swiss Catholicism. The following decades were marked by a period of professionalisation and centralisation.\nAccording to the Caritas concept, the parishes were supposed to organise social and charitable activities at a local level, with varying degrees of success and effectiveness. Special Caritas Sundays, featuring illustrated presentations and other activities, were organised to raise awareness among parishioners. Additionally, beyond the parishes, Caritas provided additional religious, ideological, and professional training to professionals working in institutions, homes, and hospitals.\nIn the late 1920s, the organisation worked with specific vulnerable groups, including children and youth, tuberculosis patients, the elderly, alcoholics, people with different disabilities, etc. In the field of curative education, Caritas founded curative institutes in Lucerne in 1932 and at the University of Fribourg in 1936.\nFollowing Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933, the refugee problem increasingly became a focus for Caritas Switzerland. In 1936, the Commission for Catholic Refugee Aid was founded. After the \"Anschluss\" of Austria in 1938, the financial costs of Caritas' refugee assistance escalated due to a rapid increase in the number of Catholic refugees. By the end of the war in 1945, Caritas was providing care for approximately 18,000 refugees.\n\n\n=== Since the 1950s ===\nThe rapid post-war expansion had repercussions for the Caritas organisation. Internal crises emerged, leading to the resignation of Director Giuseppe Crivelli and prompting a revision of the statutes in 1950. Starting from the latter part of the 1950s, Caritas started supporting other refugees, this time from the European Eastern Bloc, providing assistance to around half of the more than 10,000 Hungarian refugees arriving in Switzerland in 1956 after the failed Hungarian Revolution. From 1968/69, the organisation assisted thousands of Czechs and Slovaks who were granted asylum after the Prague Spring. During the 1960s, the focus shifted towards emergency and disaster relief efforts. Caritas organised campaigns for India (1965/1966), flood victims in Portugal and in Romania (1967 and 1970), as well ass for victims of the 1968 Belice earthquake in Sicily and the 1970 Ancash earthquake in Peru.\nA significant relief operation took place between 1968 and 1970 for victims of the Biafran War in Nigeria, bringing in more than 11 million CHF in donations. This surpassed the association's existing infrastructure capabilities and triggered a period of growth, followed by another internal crisis, which culminated in 1971 with the resignation of Director Peter Kuhn (1935–1995). Subsequently, a revision of the statutes the following year was initiated, leading to an internal reform within the organisation.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Caritas Switzerland evolved into a multi-sector aid organisation with a broad scope of activities, encompassing social initiatives in Switzerland and disaster and development aid internationally. Starting in 1982, it redirected its efforts from short-term emergency assistance towards longer-term reconstruction aid.\n\n\n== Structure and work ==\n\nCaritas Switzerland consists of 16 regional, independent Caritas organisations in Switzerland. They implement social projects locally. Together with Caritas Switzerland, they are involved in nationwide campaigns to reduce poverty, as well as in specific activities such as debt counselling and the operation of the Caritas social supermarkets. The regional Caritas organisations support people affected by poverty in Switzerland and contribute therewith to social integration.\nWith its programmes and political work, Caritas helps to ensure that people in need, regardless of their political or religious beliefs, gender or ethnicity, can take advantage of their opportunities and have access to food, shelter, healthcare, education and work.\nThe 16 local organisations are:\n\nInternationally, Caritas Switzerland implemented projects in 2023 in around 20 countries in Africa, Asia, Europa and Latin America, through its in-country local offices and by supporting local partner organisations.\n\n\n== Prix Caritas ==\nSince 2003, Caritas Switzerland has been awarding the Prix Caritas (\"Caritas Prize\") to people who have made an outstanding contribution in the fields of social work, development cooperation or intercultural understanding. The price is endowed with 10,000 Swiss francs. The recipients are:\n\n2003: Shay Cullen, for his commitment to human rights and anti-trafficking in the Philippines.\n2004: Rosiamo Ashurova and Saodat Kamalova, doctors from Tajikistan, for their commitment to human dignity in a society in crisis.\n2005: Paride Taban, Bishop, for his decades-long commitment to peace and justice in South Sudan.\n2006: Jesús Abad Colorado, Colombian photojournalist, for his commitment to peace and justice in Colombia.\n2007: Fr.

        "content": "Astonbury Wood is a nature reserve of Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. It is an ancient woodland, near Stevenage in Hertfordshire, England.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe 125-year lease of the wood, put up for sale by Hertfordshire County Council in 2020, was purchased after money was raised by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust, and plans to protect the wood were begun in March 2023. Initial plans included a safety survey of trees and paths, ecological surveys, management planning to establish priorities, and planning signage and trails on the site.\nThe wood, area 54 hectares (130 acres), was in existence by 1600, so is classed as ancient woodland; such woods are much rarer than they once were. Because of the flora and fauna which has developed over this time, the site is designated a Local Wildlife Site. The trees are mostly oak and hornbeam, and spring flowers include bluebell, primrose, wood anemone and dog's mercury. The site is nationally recognised for fungi, of which many species have been identified.\nThe Ancient Astonbury and Wilder Woodlands Project, funded by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was announced in April 2024, with the aim to restore and conserve Astonbury Wood and six other woods of the Trust: Balls Wood, Fir and Pond Woods, Gobions Wood, Old Park Wood, Long Deans and Hawkins Wood. Iain Ward, an officer of the project, said that it would \"encourage the involvement of volunteers in their restoration and conservation.... A big part of it is to connect the community to Astonbury Wood, along with our other key woodland sites.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

The name of Deepak is called to sign of light lamp or sun light. We all know there is nothing without the reflection of light. It's hope of every person in their \"Yes, everything is possible, if we commit to do this then we will definitely achieve\" | Like these quotes everyone thinks about at the end of their life struggle. When human knows about the reality of the struggle of light, how Deepak | Sun | Lamp generating the light in this world, it's impossible without self burn for example: Deepak : Deepak burns his body to light up the space. Sun : Sun is continuously burning and generating lights to glow up the whole galaxy brahmand areas and stones. So, this all about the meaning of the Deepak (word).\n\n\n== Dablar ==\nThe Dablar is person identity, which means, which backward class he belongs to in this world. We all know about Backwardsidentification, it refers to the type of person, which Human identity category he is belonging to. Every country has a different type of backward person and name of backward caste. The backward caste is called the \"surname\" of humans.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nThe final thought about words is that every word has its own identity, if the name of person, name of place, name of things is generated, then there are various reasons behind the creation. The whole World and Brahmand Galaxy is a mystery. No one can resolve the chemistry of the creation.",

From that time, a masterfully crafted staircase with railings by the master Ivan Shastkov has been preserved.\nIn 1884, Ivan Franko and Volodyslav Fedorovych stayed in the two-story mansion of the landowner Czartoryski. The writer worked in the library with documents and materials about the Ukrainian patriotic Fedorovych family.\nIn 1991, a memorial plaque to Ivan Franko was installed on the facade of the palace.\nNear the estate there are four ponds and an old park, which was laid out in the 1840s by the Dzieduszyckis, who invited specialists from France. Today, the area has a beech alley, centuries-old trees: Manchurian walnut, purple beech, American pines, a 200-year-old small-leaved linden, and two poplars 150–200 years old.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRąkowski G., Luboński, P.

        "content": "Jairo Lugo-Ocando is a journalist and professor, political-economic analyst, author of several books on journalism and society.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJairo Lugo-Ocando was born in Maracaibo-Zulia in 1968, is a distinguished academic and author of Venezuelan-British heritage, renowned for his insightful writings on journalism, poverty, and broader media issues. His scholarly focus particularly shines in dissecting how the news media portrays poverty, social exclusion, and development.\nCurrently serving as the Dean of the College of Communication at the prestigious University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.\nLugo-Ocando has previously held the esteemed position of Director of Executive and Graduate Education at Northwestern University in Qatar.\nAmong his notable literary contributions are recent works such as 'The News Media in Puerto Rico: Journalism in Colonial Settings and in Times of Crisis' (Routledge, 2020), 'Media & Governance in Latin America: Towards a Plurality of Voices'         (Peter Lang, 2020), and 'Foreign Aid and Journalism in the Global South: A Mouthpiece for Truth' (Lexington Books), 2020).\nBefore embarking on his academic journey, Lugo-Ocando honed his skills and insights as a journalist, correspondent, and news editor across various media platforms in Latin America and the United States. This practical experience infuses his scholarly work with a depth of understanding and real-world perspective.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nLugo-Ocando studied in Venezuela at the Ciclo Combinado Udon Pérez high school in Maracaibo and from there went to study a Licentiate degree (equivalent to BA+MA) in Social Communication and Print Journalism at the University of Zulia in his home state.\nHe worked at several newspapers in Venezuela, including as a reporter at La Columna, correspondent of Economía Hoy, columnist in Diario Panorama, news editor at Diario Los Andes and later chief news editor at Diario La Verdad.\nHe has written for a variety of magazines and contributed to television and radio program as well as founder in 1995 of Diario del Lago, the first online daily news media in Venezuela.\nAfter years of practicing as a journalists and news reporter, he went to the United Kingdom where he first studied as a Master's in Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University with a Chevening scholarship and then he undertook a PhD at the University of Sussex in media Studies, where he also received a scholarship from that university.\nIn academia, he has worked in the UK as a scholar at Liverpool John Moores University, the University of Stirling, the University of Sheffield and at the University of Leeds, where he became the deputy-head of the School of Media and Communication. In 2018, he was recruited to Northwestern University for its Qatar campus, to design and develop their Master's and Executive Education programs.\nOver the years, Lugo-Ocando has researched and published a variety of books, peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters in different languages, where he discusses a variety of issues around media studies and journalism. Today he continues to be engaged with the mainstream news media as regular commentator of Al-Jazeera, columnist in several newspapers, while being the vice-president of Golfo Radio 98.3 FM radio in Qatar, which is the first free-to-air radio station in Spanish and Portuguese in the Middle East.\n\n\n== Body of work ==\nJairo Lugo-Ocando's work mostly debates the way news media represents issues around poverty, social exclusion and, more broadly in the international level, development. He has argued that generally speaking while the news media tends to cover poverty, it does so by presenting the manifestations of poverty rather than its root causes.\nThis lack of structural analysis, he says, can be traced back to the deontology of journalism which embraces objectivity. In so doing, journalists refrain themselves from incorporating any type of language or narratives that could be seen as ideological. Moreover, he adds, it is often the case that poverty is either blamed upon the individuals themselves and the choices they made or upon natural causes.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nScholarly debates have produced important criticism against Lugo-Ocando's thesis, including Toussaint Nothias own work that argues against the idea that news coverage of Africa remains detrimental. He highlights instead that news coverage about Africa has actually improved and is far more positive today that what many as Lugo-Ocando give credit for.\nOther scholars such as Isabel Awad criticises Lugo-Ocando's deterministic approach and remind him and others that when it comes to reporting poverty, it is important to consider that journalists are 'sociological beings' with power and agency and that the production is not an inexorable process just defined by structure.\nAwad has made clear in her own work, that people in poverty and journalists are agents and that it is not possible to keep structure and agency as oppositional categories in the analysis.\n\n\n== Media Coverage ==\nLugo-Ocando remains very active in traditional and social media here is discussing his work and current affairs. Invited regularly to Al-Jazeera and other networks, he often talks about issues around power, poverty and the media.\nHe continues to write for a diversity of publications and his columns have appear in El Clarin in Argentina, the Conversation, among others.\n\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nLugo-Ocando, Jairo (2020).

Following this, he became a Postdoctoral Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at Harvard University from 1980 to 1981.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVafai began his academic career as an assistant professor at The Ohio State University in 1981, later becoming associate professor in 1986 and Professor in 1991. In 2000, he joined the University of California, Riverside as a Presidential Chair Professor, and was appointed Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2014.\nVafai took on the position of Director of Bourns College of Engineering Online Master-of-Science in Engineering Program at the University of California, Riverside in 2015.\nVafai provided consulting services to various companies and laboratories and engaged in research collaborations with several countries. He also served as a Principal or Co-principal Investigator and led research projects funded by organizations such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) Aircraft Brake Systems Corporation (ABSC), BFGoodrich, Bell Labs and the Department of Energy (DOE).\n\n\n== Research ==\nVafai has contributed to the field of mechanical engineering by studying heat and mass transfer and fluid mechanics, particularly focusing on porous media transport, natural convection, condensation, multiphase transport, aircraft brake housing heat transfer, electronic cooling and biomedical applications.\n\n\n== Works ==\nVafai has published works on the use of porous media and heat transfer, along with many book chapters and symposium volumes across different subjects. He edited the first, second and third editions of the Handbook of Porous Media, which compiled research on heat and mass transfer in porous media, covering topics like applied models, forced convection, and advancements in fundamental and applied research. In related research, his book, Porous Media: Applications in Biological Systems and Biotechnology, explored the applications of biomedical fields, showcasing collaborations among scientists and engineers to address challenges and potential advancements in biological systems.\n\n\n=== Porous media ===\nVafai's research on porous media focused on fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer. He pioneered the analysis of fundamental aspects in the study of fluid flow and heat transfer through a saturated porous medium. He also lent to the understanding of non-equilibrium heat and mass transfer in porous media and the thermal interactions between solid and fluid phases. His works included a comprehensive review and simulation of multiphase transport through porous media, where key principles regarding local thermal equilibrium, dimensionality effects, and phase change effects were established.\nIn a paper that introduced the Vafai number in Physics of Fluids, the Darcy–Bénard convection in a porous medium was examined incorporating phase-lag effects to derive an extended model to gain insights into the transition from local thermal non-equilibrium to equilibrium.\n\n\n=== Biomedical applications ===\nVafai has been engaged in biomedical applications, including the simulation of macromolecule transport through arteries, the study of biofilms, and the utilization of magnetic resonance imaging for early brain stroke detection. He contributed to developing biosensors for biological detection and modeling tissues and organs and introduced a four-layer model for LDL transport in arterial walls, discussing its effectiveness in checking atherosclerosis initiation under different conditions. Additionally, he holds patents for research in initiating control over flow, heat, and mass transfer inside thin film fluidic cells to mitigate flow and thermal disturbances on sensor surfaces. He devised a Rapid Microfluidic Thermal Cycler for Nucleic Acid amplification using a microfluidic heat exchanger and porous medium, alongside a method and system for noninvasive treatment of neurodegenerative disorders through magnetothermal stimulation of neuron cells in the brain.\nVafai led the establishment of a thorough simulation of biofilms incorporating the involved physical issues, investigating biofilm resistance to biocide treatment, considering physical attributes and providing correlations to predict microbial survival. He examined how biofilm formation alters porosity and permeability in porous matrices using multispecies biofilm models and a modified Kozeny-Carman framework, focusing on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and developed a multidimensional, multispecies, heterogeneous biofilm model using balance equations, exploring the effects of changing biofilm surface geometries and porous media conditions. In a paper with Sara Abdelsalam that received an honorable mention for the Bellman Prize-Elsevier (2020–2021), he pointed out the influence of Womersley number and occlusion on flow characteristics in small blood arteries, providing insights into the Segré–Silberberg effect.\n\n\n=== Flat-shaped heat pipes and microchannels ===\nVafai studied heat pipes and microchannels to assess their heat transfer capabilities. His research group has found that flat-shaped heat pipes outperform cylindrical ones, especially in adapting to various geometries, ideal for asymmetrical heating/cooling in electronics and spacecraft where cylindrical pipes struggle with limited heat sources and sink use. He analyzed multichannel heat pipes for the first time and established that flat-shaped heat pipes substantially improve heat dissipation, offer higher heat transfer capabilities, and provide multiple condensate return paths, thus overcoming prospect of a dry out condition crucial for managing high heat transfer applications. Furthermore, he demonstrated that flat-shaped heat pipes create surfaces with minimal temperature variations, eliminating hot spots and ensuring uniform component temperatures, making them valuable for maintaining consistent operating conditions for electronic components. He also came up for the first time with the concept and detailed evaluation of disk-shaped heat pipes which have an even higher heat removal capability.\nIn a joint study with Lu Zhu, Vafai proposed for the first time, the design and implementation of double and multi-layer microchannels, aiming to alleviate two primary drawbacks of these devices which are high-temperature gradients and the amount of required pumping power.\n\n\n=== Buoyancy induced flows ===\nVafai has conducted research on the interrelationship between Nusselt number oscillations, temperature distribution, fluid flow patterns, and vortex dynamics. He has identified various cell structures within moderate and narrow gap annuli, including the existence of an odd number of cells for the first time, and distinct flow structures and heat transfer characteristics, including spiral vortex secondary flow and transverse vortices, which provide quantitative descriptions of three-dimensional convection patterns and unicellular flow development in buoyancy-induced convection. Looking into buoyancy-driven convection in an open-ended cavity, he underscored the importance of irregular vortex behavior and the limitations of two-dimensional assumptions in transient flow and temperature fields.\nVafai provided a detailed and thorough review of free surface flows with and without the presence of a porous medium through modeling, experimentation, and finite difference and finite element simulations. He collaborated with S.C. Chen to research various aspects of free surface transport phenomena in porous media, including the effects of surface tension, comparative analysis of numerical methods, experimental investigation of transport within hollow glass ampules, and momentum and energy transport. They proposed novel analytical and numerical methods, giving insights for applications such as glass processing and optical fiber production.\n\n\n=== Electronic cooling ===\nVafai and his students and his research scholars have conducted research on the 3D integrated circuit, introducing optimized thermal performance through integrated double-layer microchannels (DLMC) and multi-layer microchannels (MLMC). He assessed key attributes of a 3D integrated chip structure, including critical features such as substrate size, heat sink, device layer, through silicon vias (TSVs), thermal interface material (TIM), and the arrangement of core processors and TSVs. In addition, he conducted in-depth study of the variation of thermal conductivity, total heat dissipation, and power distribution within the device layers and core processors and showed the effects of varying features of the 3D Integrated Circuit (IC) structure on thermal hotspots, along with an optimization route for hotspot reduction.\nVafai has been granted US patents related to the innovative 3D chip cooling, the configuration of a thin film microchannel to result in less coolant flow, and enhanced thin film cooling through flexible complex seals in response to temperature or thermal load increases and electronic cooling. Furthermore, his inventions encompass devices with multi-compartment fluidic cells, flexible seals, and complex seals with closed cavities, aimed at controlling fluid flow rates, enhancing insulation properties, and regulating thermal conditions.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1999 - Classic Paper Award, ASME Heat Transfer Division\n2006 – Heat Transfer Memorial Award, ASME\n2011 – Honorary Lifetime Membership Award, International Society of Porous Media (InterPore)\n2013 – 75th Anniversary Medal, ASME Heat Transfer Division\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nPorous Media: Applications in Biological Systems and Biotechnology (2010) ISBN 978-1420065411\nHandbook of Porous Media, third edition (2015) ISBN 978-1439885543\nHeat Transfer Enhancement with Nanofluids (2015) ISBN 978-1482254006\nConvective Heat Transfer in Porous Media (2019) ISBN 978-0367030803\nThe Role of Nanofluids in Renewable Energy Engineering (2023) ISBN 978-3036593821\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nVafai, K., & Tien, C.

        "content": "St Margaret's Church, Bucknall is a Grade II* listed parish church in the village of Bucknall, Lincolnshire, England. It has been described as \"partly 13th century with traces of Norman and the external features mainly Victorian.\" The church was originally built in the 13th century and built by the Normans. The two arcades of four bays are 13th-century, and the font was installed in 1646.   The church saw extensive restorations between 1884 and 1912 to the main building and tower. The church remains an active place of worship: as of April 2024 there were two regular monthly services and occasional other services.  Bucknall is one of five Anglican parishes in the Woodhall Spa Group of Churches, in the Deanery of Horncastle. The group serves the rural villages of Central Lincolnshire: Woodhall Spa and Kirkstead, Stixwould and Woodhall, Horsington, Langton, and Bucknall.\nPart of the church's listing entry describes it as having: \n\n\"Western tower, nave, 2 aisles, south porch, chancel. The 2 stage tower is partly of C16 and was originally entirely of limestone. It has angled buttresses, plinth, string course, embattled and pinnacled parapet. The west door is C19, pointed and with hood mould. Above is a C16 2 light window apparently in situ with 4 centred arched heads to the lights and plain chamfered surround. To belfry stage are paired C19 cusped lights under pointed arches with hood moulds. The north aisle has 3 paired cusped C19 lights and a single plain window. At the east end of the aisle is a plain C19 lancet. At the east end of the chancel are triple lancets united under a moulded hood. The south side of the chancel has 2 paired lancet windows with a pointed priest's door between, all with moulded hoods and labels..\" - \"Buildings of England : Lincolnshire: Pevsner N: Lincolnshire: London: 1989-: 526\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMonument record MLI40068 - St Margaret's Church and Cross Base, Bucknall at Lincolnshire Heritage Explorer",

The five trustees of the corporation were Washington E. Hudson, John Rogers, C. W. Benedict, \"William Shelly\" Rogers, and Alf Heggem, and they officed out of the Mayo Building.\nIn 1923, the organization built Beno Hall, a 3,000 seat and 3-story meeting hall. Beno Hall was intentionally built near the Greenwood District, Tulsa, a large African American neighborhood in north Tulsa. W. Tate Brady supplied part of the land for Beno Hall. It was colloquially called \"Be No Hall,\" a reference to how there would \"Be No Nigger, Jew, Catholic, or Immigrant\" at the hall.\nThe association ceased to exist in 1925 after infighting caused the departure of Washington E. Hudson. Beno Hall was insolvent by 1929, and was sold to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office.  In 1976 Beno Hall was demolished.\n\n\n== References ==",

These resources encompass a wide range of components, including air, water, land, biodiversity, minerals, energy sources, and ecosystems. Managing and conserving environmental resources are critical for sustainable development and the well-being of current and future generations.\n\n\n== Types of Environmental Resources ==\nAir: The atmosphere is a vital environmental resource, providing oxygen for living organisms and regulating climate patterns. However, air quality can be compromised by pollutants like particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), gases like carbon dioxide and methane, and ozone depletion substances.\nWater: Freshwater resources, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater, are essential for drinking, agriculture, industry, and ecosystem functioning. Water scarcity and pollution pose significant challenges to sustainable water management.\nLand: Land resources encompass soil, forests, wetlands, and agricultural areas. These resources support food production, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and natural habitats. Land degradation, deforestation, and urbanization are key issues affecting land resource sustainability.\nBiodiversity: Biodiversity includes the variety of species, genetic diversity, and ecosystems on Earth. It contributes to ecological stability, ecosystem services, medicine, agriculture, and cultural heritage. Habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and invasive species threaten biodiversity conservation.\nMinerals and Energy: Natural resources such as minerals, fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, and metals are essential for economic activities, infrastructure development, and energy production. Sustainable resource extraction, energy efficiency, and transitioning to renewable energy are vital for environmental sustainability.\n\n\n== Importance of Environmental Resources ==\nEcosystem Services: Environmental resources provide ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, climate regulation, soil fertility, and natural hazard mitigation, supporting human well-being and economic activities.\nHuman Health: Clean air, water, and a healthy environment are crucial for human health, reducing risks of respiratory diseases, waterborne illnesses, and exposure to hazardous substances.\nEconomic Value: Environmental resources contribute to economic growth, livelihoods, tourism, recreation, and cultural heritage, highlighting their economic importance.\n\n\n== Challenges and Conservation Efforts ==\nClimate Change: Global warming, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and climate-related risks are pressing challenges requiring mitigation strategies, adaptation measures, and international cooperation.\nPollution: Air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, plastic waste, and chemical pollutants necessitate pollution control measures, waste management, recycling, and sustainable consumption practices.\nResource Depletion: Overexploitation, deforestation, habitat loss, land degradation, and water scarcity call for sustainable resource management, conservation efforts, restoration projects, and biodiversity conservation initiatives.\n\n\n== Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ==\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address environmental sustainability through goals such as clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15), and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rupert Jasen Smith Jr. (February 1951 – February 15, 1989) was an American artist. He worked closely with pop artist Andy Warhol as a silkscreen printer and art director for a decade. His association with Warhol led him to work with other artists such as Paul Jenkins, Frank Stella, and Robert Rauschenberg. Smith owned one of New York City's top printmaking studios and also held solo exhibitions of his artwork.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSmith grew up in St. Lucie County, Florida the son of an attorney, Rupert Jasen Smith Sr., and Peggy Hamilton, an interior designer. His father later became a circuit judge of the 19th Judicial Circuit. His maternal uncle was James Hamilton, the scenic designer behind the award-winning sets for the musical Oliver! and other stage productions.\nSmith attended prep school in Boca Raton, Florida. He had his first art show as a teenager in Fort Pierce, Florida in 1967.\nIn 1973, Smith received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in New York City. During his first year as an art student, Smith accompanied actress Julie Christie around New York City. \n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from the Pratt Institute, Smith and a group of other students rented two former cheese factories on Duane Street in Manhattan's Financial District to use as lofts. They gut renovated the buildings themselves and subsequently the buildings were featured on the cover of a national magazine to highlight an article on \"Urban Pioneers\" in 1975. Smith used one of the lofts as a studio and he later purchased the two buildings. Smith's studio became one of New York's top printmaking studios. His clients included artists Andy Warhol, Jamie Wyeth, and Robert Rauschenberg, and musician John Lennon.\nSmith worked with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency before meeting Warhol in 1977. He began working with Warhol on his Hammer and Sickle (1977) series. Warhol was impressed with Smith's work and appointed him his master printmaker and art director. Warhol allowed Smith's printer's stamp to be placed next to his signature on their collaborations, which include silkscreen portraits of Princess Grace of Monaco, Ingrid Bergman, Mickey Mouse, and Edward Kennedy. Smith was also a serigrapher for the Warhol series Ten Portraits of Jews of the Twentieth Century (1980), Shoes (1980), Myths (1981), Endangered Species (1983), and Reigning Queens (1985). Smith's printer's stamp is also on the works of artists Larry Rivers, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, and photographer Francesco Scavullo.\nSmith simultaneously created his own artwork while spending evenings and weekends working at Warhol's Factory. Like his mentor, Smith became successful in his interpretations of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell's soup cans. He did silkscreen paintings of actress Greta Garbo and was working on a portfolio of notable female performers such as Cher and Liza Minnelli. In 1981, Smith had a one-man show at the North Miami Museum & Art Center. His work was also exhibited at the Gallery Sho in Tokyo, Gallerie Borjeson in Sweden, the Fred Dorfman Gallery in New York, and the Hokin galleries in Chicago, Miami, and Palm Beach. By 1982, Smith's work was selling from $500 to $5,000, and on occasion, he had fetched $25,000 and above for his Warhol collaborations. Musician John Lennon, singer Mick Jagger, and actress Julie Christie had Smith's work in their collections. \nSmith was known for applying diamond dust to his paintings. \"I have always liked the way the lines of a boat reflect in the water, the distortions. The figures are just a vehicle for reflections on water and the diamond dust compliments the reflections. I put it on the highlights — the whitest, hottest, brightest spots,\" he said. This technique was inspired by the reflective ground optical glass on the State of Florida traffic warning signs. Smith stated that during his early experimentation, he had spent up to $10,000 on a 50-pound bag of premium diamond dust before realizing that industrial-grade dust, which costs $1,200 per bag, created the same illuminating effect.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSmith had an estate in New Hope, Pennsylvania, and an apartment in New York City.\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn September 1988, Smith was diagnosed with AIDS. In early February 1989, he attended a dinner for the opening of a Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\nSmith died a week before his 38th birthday in Fort Lauderdale of complications from AIDS on February 15, 1989. He was survived by his parents, a brother, Mark Smith, and his companion Daniel Polaski. Smith's parents asked for donations in his memory to be made to the University of Miami School of Medicine, Clinical Immunology Lab, or the Aids Project for Health Crisis Network.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Conceptualized and authored by Senator Sonny Angara, the Tatak Pinoy Act of the Philippines is a product of close to five years of extensive consultations, studies and research by the Office of Senator Angara to develop a multi-year, comprehensive strategy for the government and private sector to foster greater collaboration between the two sides. It was signed into law by President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos, Jr. on February 26, 2024.\n\n\n== Goal of the Tatak Pinoy Act ==\nThe goal of Tatak Pinoy is to empower Philippine industries to come up with high-value and sophisticated goods and services that will make them more competitive in both the global and domestic markets. With Tatak Pinoy, Philippine industries will be encouraged to embrace innovation and engage in technology transfer so that they will grow at a faster pace. This will eventually translate to sustained economic growth and higher incomes for Filipinos, who would finally be able to see more opportunities here at home.\nTatak Pinoy will complement and help attain the goals set forth in the Philippine Development Plan. Under the Tatak Pinoy Act, there will be targeted interventions aimed at specific industries and sectors that have the potential for further growth or expansion. A Tatak Pinoy Strategy will be formulated that will serve as the roadmap for the national government agencies, the local government units, and the private sector in attaining the goals outlined in the law.\n\n\n== Tatak Pinoy Strategy ==\nThe Tatak Pinoy Law lies at the core of the Philippines' industrialization strategy, revitalizing and driving the economic agenda with precision. With its focus on promoting industrial excellence, embracing innovation, and navigating contemporary challenges, Tatak Pinoy is a transformative legislation that empowers Philippine industries to thrive in an intensely competitive global landscape.\nUnder the law, a Tatak Pinoy Council will spearhead the development and implementation of a multi-year strategy focusing on five key pillars:\n\nhuman resources\ninfrastructure\ntechnology and innovation\ninvestments\nsound financial management\n\nUnder the Tatak Pinoy Law, industries will receive the support for the expansion and upgrading of their operations to make them more competitive in both the global and domestic markets.\n\nBig and small industries will also be encouraged to innovate in order to produce higher value products that are sought after by bigger markets and will result in greater incomes for them.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has a tender and solid texture, with a distinct taste of soybeans. It could also be made with mung beans. This food is especially popular in Southwestern China.: 123.1 \n\n\n== Details ==\n\"Douhua\", commonly known as a different food in other regions of China and Taiwan, is referred as doufunao (Chinese: 豆腐脑, 'tofu brain') in the region where douhua is popular. There are no significant differences in the making of Douhua, doufunao and tofu other than the use of solidifier and the force used for pressing. Doufunao requires minimal solidifier and pressing, while douhua used less solidifier than tofu and is loosely pressed in comparison.\nDouhua often served as an important ingredient in Sichuanese cuisine. It can be served with meat in a stew, like fish (Chinese: 豆花鱼) or beef (Chinese: 豆花牛肉). Additionally, it can be used to thicken hot pot, or paired individually with a dip.: 123.18  There is a Sichuanese speciality dish called Jidouhua (Chinese: 鸡豆花, 'chicken douhua'), which uses chicken to imitate the texture of douhua.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nipper Kabirriki, also recorded as Nippa Kapirigi (c. 1910 – 24 April 1987) was a Kundjeyhmi man, stockman and research collaborator from the Northern Territory.\nHis work was instrumental to the establishment of Kakadu National Park. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nKabirriki was born in a rock shelter in Western Arnhem Land and his parents were Nakulidj and Maggie Mengkawindi and he was a member of the Badmardi Clan and was a Traditional Owner of Deaf Adder Gorge in the region. He spent much of his early life travelling around the Alligator Rivers region and Kabirriki remembers understanding that he had \"to go around, every place\" based on the season. One of his earliest memories was seeing the first feral water buffalo entering the region and spearing in, alongside his brother George Mingum, and eating the meat.\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s Kabirriki began worked for pastoralists, buffalo hunters, miners and drovers who were increasingly coming to the region and he took great pride in his work. His work with buffalo hunters led to him being featured in Buffaloes by Carl Warburton in 1934; this publication referred to him as Koperaki and detailed their first meeting, his significance within the community and many of the interactions that they had. Warburton described him \"as a fine type of man, black or white, that I ever wish to meet\".\nIn 1972 he became a research collaborator with Johan Kamminga, which contributed to the creation of the Kakadu National Park, during their work together they made two trips to Deaf Adder Gorge. Later, in 1978, Kabirriki worked with George Chaloupka, an expert in rock art, where they documented clan territories and previously unidentified rock art sites, including many by Nayombolmi, across what would become stage one of the National Park. Kabirriki offered insight into their cultural significance and, together, they were able to create a sequence to many of the paintings and the way they documented ecological changes that were happening. The relationship between the two men has been called “the most important single conduit for lodging the cultural significance of the Kakadu landscape in the archive and representing it in the public domain”. In 1981 he also assisted Rhys Jones's archaeological team.\nWorking as a research collaborator Kabirriki was generous with his knowledge and said of this:\n\nI know all the story and law from when I was kid. My father and grandfather tell me. I remember any story.\nHe viewed sharing his knowledge as a way of discharging his responsibilities of custodianship and the proper care of Kakadu.\nHe died on 24 April 1987 at Djuwarr billabong at Deaf Adder Gorge after asking Chaloupka to take him there to die on his own country. He was buried using customary mortuary practices that had not been carried out in the region for some years.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA portrait of Kabirriki, by Frank Hodgkinson, is in the collection of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, this work is entitles Portrait of Nipper Kapirigi. This portrait was shortlisted in the 1981 Archibald Prize.\n\n\n== References ==",

They are slowly gravitationally drifting towards each other and are in the first phase of merging. A faint plume is seen around the pair hinting they are possibly undergoing intense star formation. The galaxies have an approximate diameter of 140,000 thousand light-years which means they are slightly bigger compared to the Milky Way. Both galaxies belong to Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies which they belong to class of galaxies of material that is ejecting from nuclei.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "TT338 is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian artist Maya and his wife Tamyt in Deir el-Medina near modern Luxor, Egypt. Maya was titled \"outline-draughtsman of Amun\" and was active in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The chapel was probably discovered in the early 1900s. The painted interior depicts the funerary procession and feasts of the deceased; the decoration was detached by the discoverers and is housed today in the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n== Owner ==\nTT338 belonged to Maya (also transcribed Maï or May), an artist who bore the title \"outline-draughtsman of Amun\" who was active in the late Eighteenth Dynasty, after the reign of Akhenaten. His wife was named Tamyt. The chapel is adjacent to TT8, which lead Bernard Bruyère to suggest they might have been related to TT8's owners, Kha and Merit.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe chapel is situated in the northern cemetery of the workmen's village of Deir el-Medina, immediate east of TT8 and about 1 metre (3.3 ft) downhill of it. It was probably discovered in the early 1900s by the Italian Archaeological Mission who removed the chapel's paintings to the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy. The chapel was once pyramid-shaped but only the vaulted chamber remains; it was likely surrounded by a walled courtyard but nothing remains of the enclosure wall. The tomb is accessed via a shaft in the courtyard and leads to two small rooms which are uninscribed.\nThe chapel was entirely decorated with funerary scenes. The two long walls have three registers each depicting the funerary procession of the deceased to their tomb, the deceased receiving funerary offerings, and boat journeys to and from Abydos. The back wall had a funerary stele at its centre surrounded by depictions of seated couples and funerary priests.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nBruyère, Bernard (1926).

        "content": "The Bruentrup Heritage Farm is a historic farmstead and museum located in Maplewood, Minnesota. Established in 1891, the farm was home to four generations of the Bruentrup family until 1999. Today, it is operated by the Maplewood Area Historical Society (MAHS) as a history museum and event venue.\n\n\n== History of the Farm ==\nWilliam Bruentrup immigrated from Germany in 1882 and married Ida Wagner in 1891. Ida's parents gifted them 40 acres of land to start the Bruentrup Farm on White Bear Avenue. Over the years, the farm grew to 175 acres, encompassing land now occupied by Maplewood Mall. The Bruentrup family primarily operated a dairy farm.\nBy the late 20th century, Maplewood experienced significant development pressure. In 1997, developers purchased the land surrounding the farm, but the Bruentrup family retained ownership of the buildings. The Maplewood City Council offered 2.5 acres of land on County Road D to relocate the farmstead buildings.  Through fundraising efforts with the Bruentrup family's cooperation, the MAHS successfully moved the historic structures to their current location in 1999.  The is leased from the city by MAHS for 99 years, and the land is surrounded by 20 acres of public open space.\n\n\n== History of the Museum ==\nThe MAHS was incorporated as a non-profit in 1997 to preserve and share the history of Maplewood with the Bruentrup Heritage Farm becoming a cornerstone of the society's mission, offering a unique opportunity to showcase Maplewood's agricultural past. The MAHS operates the farm as a museum and event center, hosting educational programs and events that promote an understanding of 19th and early 20th-century farm life in Minnesota.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Bruentrup Heritage Farm collection includes historic farm equipment, household items, and agricultural tools used by the Bruentrup family. The MAHS also maintains an archive of documents and photographs related to the farm's history and the Bruentrup family.\n\n\n== Programs and Events ==\nThe Bruentrup Heritage Farm offers a variety of educational programs and events throughout the year. These include:\n\nDay Camps: These camps provide hands-on and experiential learning opportunities that explore history and culture.\nBig Red Barn Farmers Market: A seasonal market designed to support local agriculture and businesses, and to provide community members with access to fresh, locally sourced food.\nSpecial events: Presentations on state and local history, civic discussions, and an annual Snowshoe Scramble.\nRentals: The Bruentrup Heritage Farm is also rented as a venue for wedding ceremonies and receptions, and  other events.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "Top Speed is a musical in two acts with music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar, and a book co-authored by Guy Bolton, Ruby, and Kalmar. The musical is set at the Onawanda Lodge, a fictional resort in the Thousand Islands that sits on the American side of the Canada–United States border in New York. The story follows two young and financially poor American men who fall in love with two wealthy American heiresses while vacationing far above their economic means. Misadventures ensue when the boys are asked to pilot a speed boat owned by one of the girls in an international boat race.\n\n\n== History ==\nTop Speed premiered at the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia on November 13, 1929. The production moved to Broadway's Chanin's 46th Street Theatre where it opened on Christmas Day 1929. The production transferred in the middle of its Broadway run to the Royale Theatre where it ultimately closed on March 22, 1930, after 104 performances. The cast included Irene Delroy as Virginia Rollins, Lester Allen as Elmer Peters, Ginger Rogers as Babs Green, Harland Dixon as Tad Jordan, and Paul Frawley as Gerry Brooks. \nAllen and Rogers sang the show's one hit song, the duet \"Keep Your Undershirt On\". The show also included an earlier hit song from Ruby and Kalmar's musical Good Boy which they interpolated into Top Speed, \"I Wanna Be Loved by You\".\nFirst National Pictures adapted the musical into a 1930 film of the same name starring Joe E. Brown, Bernice Claire, Jack Whiting, Laura Lee, and Frank McHugh. It was one of the earliest stage musicals made into a film.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​Top Speed​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "content": "Rectangular Micro QR Code (also known as rMQR Code) is two-dimensional (2D) matrix barcode  invented and standardized in 2022 by Denso Wave as ISO/IEC 23941. rMQR Code is designed as a rectangular variation of QR code and has the same parameters and applications as original QR code. But rMQR Code is more suitable for the rectangular areas and has difference between width and height up to 19 in R7x139 version. In this way it can be used in places where 1D barcodes are used. rMQR Code can replace Code 128 and Code 39 barcodes with more effective data encoding.\nrMQR Code consists of black squares and white square spaces arranged in a square grid on a white background. It has one finder pattern in left-top corner the same as in QR Code and small finder sub-pattern in right-bottom corner. Also, it has alignment and timing patterns to help with recognition. rMQR Code has Reed–Solomon error correction with ability to restore data from corrupted barcodes. As other 2D matrix barcodes it can be read with camera-based readers.\nAs original QR code, rMQR Code can encode Unicode characters with Extended Channel Interpretation feature, bytes array and can natively encode Japanese characters in kanji encoding. In maximal R17x139 version rMQR Code can encode up to 361 numeric, 219 alphanumeric, 150 bytes and 92 kanji characters.\n\n\n== History and application ==\nrMQR Code was invented by Denso Wave company in 2022 and standardized as ISO/IEC 23941. It is an extension of QR Code for rectangular areas and designed to be a replacement of 1D barcodes.\nrMQR Code is a novel barcode and at this time it not widely used, but it can unite QR Code features like error correction and Unicode encoding and 1D barcodes features like effective usage of rectangular areas. At this time rMQR Code yet is not widely supported by hardware printers and scanners but it is already supported by barcode libraries. In this way rMQR Code can be used in:\n\nAdvertisement;\nAutomatic data identification in document processing;\nAutomatically identified hyperlinks to internet pages;\nFood and goods tracking in retail;\nIn airports, bus / railroad stations for automatic tickets and passenger documents identification;\nPackage tracking;\nPatient or medicine identification in healthcare services or industry.\nMain advantages of rMQR Code are:\n\nAbility to encode Japanese characters with embedded methods;\nEffective usage of rectangular areas and full replacement of 1D barcodes.\nEncoding GS1 Data;\nExtended Channel Interpretation support;\nReed–Solomon error correction with ability to restore data from corrupted barcodes.\n\n\n== Barcode design ==\nRectangular Micro QR Code is designed for the better utilization of rectangular areas with all features of QR code. The symbology consists of black squares and white square spaces arranged in a square grid on a white background. Additionally, the barcode has inverse version with black background with inverse (luminance) color of elements.: 6.2 \nrMQR Code has minimal height of 7X and minimal width of 27X, where maximal height is 17X and maximal width 139X.: 7.1  rMQR Code has 32 versions with different combinations of height and width. Reed–Solomon error correction has two levels and allows to restore from 15% to 30% of corrupted data.\n\nrMQR Code symbol is constructed from the following elements:: 6.3.1 \n\nFinder pattern on top-left corner with 1X separator on bottom-right space, the same as in QR Code;\nFinder sub pattern in bottom-right corner;\nCorner finder patterns on top-right and bottom-left barcode sides, width and height variable and maximal can be 3x3;\nAlignment patterns, variable count, depends from version width: 0 in R11x27 version, 8 in R11x139 version;\nTiming patterns which are used as border around barcode;\nFormat information region around finder pattern and finder sub pattern;\nData encoding region;\nQuiet zone 2X.\nHere are some samples of Rectangular Micro QR Code (rMQR Code): \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Versions ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code can be encoded in 32 versions with height from 7X to 17X and width from 27X to 139X. All versions have two Error correction levels: M and H, which have influence on possible encoded data size and error correction. All of Rectangular Micro QR Code versions and their features can be watched in the following table:: 7.4.10 \n\n\n=== Finder patterns ===\n\nRectangular Micro QR Code has three types of finder pattern:\n\nFinder pattern: 6.3.3  on top-left corner with 1X separator on bottom-right space;\nFinder sub pattern: 6.3.7  in bottom-right corner;\nPossible corner finder patterns: 6.3.8  on top-right and bottom-left barcode corners.\nMain finder pattern is used to detect the barcode on image and its corruption can make barcode unrecognizable.\nFinder pattern has vertical and horizontal size 1-1-3-1-1. Finder sub pattern helps to detect bottom-right corner of the barcode. Finder sub pattern does not have guard zone and has vertical and horizontal size 1-1-1-1-1.\nCorner finder patterns allows to detect top-right and bottom-left corners and in some version of the rMQR Code can be cut or absent. Corner finder pattern looks like corner with white dot in the center with size 3-3.\n\n\n=== Alignment and timing patterns ===\n\nRectangular Micro QR Code has alignment: 6.3.6  and timing patterns: 6.3.5  which help to detect misaligned cells damage. Alignment pattern is represented as black rectangle 3X size rounding 1X white dot. Alignment pattern in some versions can be absent and number of alignment patterns depends from version, up to 8 alignment patterns.\n\nTiming patterns boarding the barcode where area is clean from finder and alignment patterns and additionally split the barcode vertically in the area of alignment patterns.\n\n\n=== Format Information ===\n\nRectangular Micro QR Code places format information: 7.9  in the area of finder pattern and finder sub pattern. Format information is built as 18-bit sequence containing 6 data bits, 12 error correction bits calculated using the (18, 6) Extended BCH code. Format information is masked with 011111101010110010 sequence which is placed around finder pattern and 100000101001111011 for finder sub pattern.\n\nThe first data bit defines error correction level and the second 5 data bits defines version indicator.\n\n\n=== Error correction ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code uses Reed–Solomon error correction: 7.5  and has two error correction levels M and H which can restore around 15 and 30% of damaged barcode area. All data in the barcode is split into error correction blocks (can be from 1 to 4 blocks) and error correction codewords are added to every block. After this, the blocks are united into single stream.\n\nrMQR Code use Reed–Solomon error correction over the finite field \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            256\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{256}}\n  \n or GF(28), the elements of which are encoded as bytes of 8 bits; the byte \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            7\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            6\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          b\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b_{7}b_{6}b_{5}b_{4}b_{3}b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}}\n  \n with a standard numerical value \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            ∑\n            \n              i\n              =\n              0\n            \n            \n              7\n            \n          \n          \n            b\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          \n            2\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{i=0}^{7}b_{i}2^{i}}\n  \n encodes the field element \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            ∑\n            \n              i\n              =\n              0\n            \n            \n              7\n            \n          \n          \n            b\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          \n            α\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{i=0}^{7}b_{i}\\alpha ^{i}}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        ∈\n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            256\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\in \\mathbb {F} _{256}}\n  \n is taken to be a primitive element satisfying \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            8\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          α\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          α\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          α\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{8}+\\alpha ^{4}+\\alpha ^{3}+\\alpha ^{2}+1=0}\n  \n.

In each column the bits are placed alternately in the right and left modules, moving upwards or downwards according to the direction of placement and skipping areas occupied by function patterns, changing direction at the top or bottom of the column. Each bit shall always be placed in the first available module position.\nWhen the data capacity of the symbol is such that it does not divide exactly into a number of 8-bit symbol characters, the appropriate number of remainder bits (1 to 7) shall be used to fill the symbol capacity. These remainder bits shall always have the value 0 before data masking.\n\n\n== Encoding ==\nRectangular Micro QR Code can encode 361 numeric, 219 alphanumeric, 150 bytes and 92 kanji characters in the maximal version R17x139. Additionally, it allows to encode Unicode data with Extended Channel Interpretation feature and encode GS1 data.\nrMQR Code can encode data in 8 modes: 7.4.1  where 4 modes are data encoding modes and 3 modes are indicator modes, like ECI. Also, every encoding sequence must be completed with special Terminator mode.\n\nrMQR Code usually encodes data in mixed mode: 7.4.7  which is a combination of existing modes for better compactification or special selectors like ECI designator.\n\nEvery compaction mode depends on version: 7.4.1  to select number of bits which are used as encoded characters (numbers, letters, bytes) counter. The number of bits required for every version can be watched in the following table.\n\n\n=== Numeric mode ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code encodes digits 0–9 in numeric mode.: 7.4.3  The number sequence is split into 3 digits which converted to 10 bits (000 - 999). Last 2 and 1 numbers are encoded in 7 and 4 bits. rMQR Code in numeric mode encodes 001 as mode indicator, then numbers counter and then numbers sequence converted into bits.\n\n\n=== Alphanumeric mode ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code encodes 2 alphanumeric characters: 7.4.4  from the table into 11 bits stream with the following formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        45\n        ∗\n        \n          C\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=45*C_{1}+C_{2}}\n  \n\nFinal character is encoded into 6 bits. rMQR Code in alphanumeric mode encodes 010 as mode indicator, then alphanumeric counter and then bits stream which represents encoded characters.\n\n\n=== Byte mode ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code adds mode indicator 011 and bytes counter (version dependent) before the byte stream,: 7.4.5  converted into 8-bit sequence.\n\n\n=== Kanji mode ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code encodes characters from 2 bytes JIS X 0208 2-byte character set: 7.4.6  into 13 bits with the following rules:\n\nFor characters with Shift JIS values from 0x8140 to 0x9FFC:\nsubtract 0x8140 from Shift JIS value;\nmultiply most significant byte of result by 0xC0;\nadd least significant byte to product from step 2;\nconvert result to a 13-bit binary string.\nFor characters with Shift JIS values from 0xE040 to 0xEBBF:\nsubtract 0xC140 from Shift JIS value;\nmultiply most significant byte of result by 0xC0;\nadd least significant byte to product from step 2;\nconvert result to a 13-bit binary string.\nrMQR Code adds mode indicator 100 and characters counter before the encoded kanji sequence.\n\n\n=== Unicode encoding with ECI ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code encodes Unicode characters with Extended Channel Interpretation.: 7.4.2.2  Previously it encodes ECI designator which defines encoding charset. After this, it encodes byte array of Unicode characters encoded into byte stream with mix of numeric-text-byte modes. The default ECI designator is \\000003(ISO/IEC 8859-1).\nECI designator is encoded with mode indicator 111 and ECI assignment number which can be encoded in 8, 16 or 24 bits by rules from the following table.\n\n\n=== GS1 encoding ===\nRectangular Micro QR Code can encode GS1 Data with FNC1 in first position.: 7.4.8.2  Encoding mode indicator 101 switch the barcode symbol in GS1 Application Identifiers mode. FNC1 cannot be used as split FNC1 character like in Code 128 symbol. Instead of this, % character should be used in alphanumeric mode or GS (0x1D) in byte mode. To encode % character in alphanumeric mode the character should be doubled %% and after decoding it should be transmitted as single % character.\n\n\n=== FNC1 in second position ===\nFNC1 in second position: 7.4.8.3  at this time has historical value and is not used. It was used to encode (obsolete at this time) mode identifier as first data codeword in Code 128 when FNC1 character is encoded in the second codeword (second position). More detail description you can read in ISO/IEC 15417 Annex B.\nRectangular Micro QR Code encodes FNC1 in second position as mode indicator 111, 8-bit application identifier (AIM, but I am not sure) and any other mode/modes after this.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomated identification and data capture (AIDC)\nBarcode\nDenso Wave\nExtended Channel Interpretation\nQR code\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFree Rectangular Micro QR Code generator\nFree Rectangular Micro QR Code reader\nRectangular Micro QR Code description",

Today, the church is presided since 1997 after the death of Otomewo.by Emmanuel Oseghale Aighalua, a solicitor and barrister of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. God's Kingdom Mission split from God's Kingdom Society on January 5, 1991, through the efforts of Brother Benjamin O. Tietie, who served as the first Archminister of the Mission.  Pastor David O. Amanoritsewo also broke away to form the Acceptable Christian Church, with similar doctrines as those of God's Kingdom Society (GKS).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nGideon Urhobo was born in 1903 at Ogharegi, a small fishing port near the Ethiope River, to a Christian mother and a non-Christian father. He hailed from Agbarha in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. He received his initial education at the Government School in Warri, where he also worked as a teacher. In his early years, he converted to and adhered to strict Roman Catholicism, and was baptized but not confirmed. Later, after disagreeing with certain of the Roman Catholic Church's beliefs, he broke away from the religion. A few months later, in June 1930, he began working for the Post and Telegraph department as a third-class clerk and telegraphist. He saw a South African advertisement for Watchtower literature while at work. He got the literature and started reading it and his Bible together. In 1932, he met Mr. William Roland Brown in Benin. Mr. Brown was the Trinidadian representative of Watchtower in West Africa. Brown invited him to Lagos so he could buy books for twenty-five dollars on credit. After receiving the books, he sent them to his friends Macauley J. Orode and Gabriel Agbenoma so they could be distributed to the public. Urhobo resigned his position as a clerk in 1933 to advance the gospel of Jesus Christ.  He became a full time preacher  for the Watchtower Society.\n\n\n== Founding and spread of God's Kingdom Society (GKS) ==\nGideon Urhobo was influenced by some of the doctrines of the Jehovah's Witnesses, but he began to create a unique conviction in his mission beginning from 1934. In his biography, he wrote:\n\nafter three and half years diligent and prayerful study of the Holy Bible, Jesus Christ revealed himself to me in a vision and commanded me to go and proclaim the good news of God's Kingdom (or Gospel of Peace) to all Nations as the only remedy for all human sufferings and woes; to expose all false doctrines which Satan had used to deceive the people and to keep them in ignorance of GOD’S ESTABLISHED KINGDOM or GOVERNMENT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE, and purpose of creation, and to pronounce God's written judgement against wickedness.\n\nWith this mission in mind, he disagreed with William Roland Brown over the following teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses: The failed predictions, including the prediction that Armageddon would occur in 1936 or 1937; the Jehovah's Witnesses' doctrine on Marriage;  the belief that only 144,000 people will going to heaven; the Memorial celebration; the practice of preaching by women; the very name, \"Jehovah's Witnesses\"; and the assertion that the religious group had \"no human leader\" (when at that time Joseph Franklin Rutherford was its global president).\nUrhobo and some of his friends split from Watchtower in October 1934 to start his own Society in Lagos, called \"the Lagos Division of Jehovah’s Witnesses\". From that point on, Urhobo started debating and criticizing Watchtower's beliefs. He also criticized the Muslim faith, and mainline churches—particularly the Roman Catholic Church. he began to deliver a series of lectures entitled, \"My Mission to the World\", in different parts of Nigeria.  Urhobo later renamed his group the \"Lagos Company of Christian People\" in 1939 due to objections from Mr. W. R. Brown. Under Saint Urhobo's guidance, the Church expanded to Port Harcourt in 1940. Concerns from Port Harcourt members about the exclusive name led to a change to the \"Nigerian Christian Society\" in 1942. In 1943, members in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) pushed for inclusivity, prompting a renaming to GOD’S KINGDOM SOCIETY (GKS). Concurrently, Saint Urhobo adopted a new name, GIDEON MERIODERE URHOBO, in 1943, in homage to his great-great-grandfather, Urhobo. His movement, God's Kingdom Society grew into hundreds of members by the 1950s. Saint Urhobo founded Church branches in Lagos (1934), Port Harcourt (1940), Warri, and Sapele (1942), followed by Onitsha (1946) and Aba (1948).\nGKS has grown to have followers in Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana, North America, Benin  and England.\n\n\n== Political interventions ==\nGideon Urhobo began to intervene in the political struggle for the independence of Nigeria when he aligned with and helped Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe in the nationalist cause. Later, when the party's leadership asserted that Jehovah of the Bible had no part in Nigerian nationalism, he disagreed with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). They held that the sun was the god of Africa in an attempt to reject western religion as they fought to free themselves from western colonization.\nOther than the \"weeping Jeremiahs,\" Dr. Azikiwe made no statements after Urhobo started attacking the N.C.N.C. in June 1951. Azikiwe had remained silent for two reasons. First of all, Urhobo was popular, and the N.C.N.C. opposing him as a group would only make him more so, particularly when it came to the question of God in Nigeria. Secondly, at every location where Urhobo preached against the N.C.N.C., there were additional elements that worked against his objectives. Urhobo began to support the Action Group, a rival party founded by Chief Obafemi Awolowo, up until the general elections of 1951–1952.\nGideon Urhobo died on February 25, 1952, while a partial eclipse of the sun occurred. The Daily Times of Saturday, January, 1952 carried his advertisement on page five entitled: “My Mission to the World”.\nDuring the inter-ethnic crisis that shook Warri in 1998 and 2003, the God's Kingdom Society was instrumental in putting an end to the violence and brotherly war by issuing two distinct statements on Tuesday, November 17, 1998, and August 19, 2003.\n\n\n== Doctrine of GKS ==\nThe majority of the Watchtower Society's liturgy and beliefs are observed by God's Kingdom Society, these include rejecting \"speaking in tongues,\"; defining the Holy Spirit as \"the invisible, active force of God,\"; believing that Jesus was born in October; avoiding interfaith relations; opposing racism, and only baptizing adults. But God's Kingdom Society rejects the idea that Jehovah has selected 144,000 people to live and reign with him at the end of the world and many other differences as outlined above. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishing of God's Kingdom on earth are highly valued concepts in God's Kingdom Society. The tale of G.K.S.'s battles with various movements and institutions is heavily influenced by both secular and religious factors. The Society holds that it has been tasked by God with exposing the \"false\" beliefs of other religious organizations and that it is in possession of the truth of God's word, which must be conveyed to all peoples. The G.K.S. is always prepared to combat atheism on behalf of God and its interpretation of Christianity. Because of this, the Society has occasionally engaged in polemics with politicians and their parties. The religious group has been known to observe a week-long Feast of Tabernacles. They do not celebrate Christmas.\n\n\n== Literature on Gideon Urhobo and GKS ==\nGideon Urhobo wrote and delivered a series of lectures entitled. \"My Mission to the World\". In 2004, a book entitled, \"Gideon M. Urhobo and the God's Kingdom Society in Nigeria\", was written by Professor Daniel I. Ilega of the University of Port Harcourt.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Emily Goodrich Smith (1830–1903) was an American newspaper correspondent. Her father, Hon. Samuel Griswold Goodrich, widely known as \"Peter Parley\", was consul in Paris, affording an opportunity for Smith to be educated abroad. While living in Paris, in 1848, she witnessed the terrors enacted during the reign of Louis Philippe I. The Goodrich house was constantly filled with terror-stricken foreigners, who found their only safety under the protection of the American flag. Returning to the U.S., in 1856, she wrote many stories and verses for magazines, her letters during the civil war were widely read and copied. She was one of the founders of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC) and state secretary for Connecticut. She also served as a vice-regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association for Connecticut.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEmily L. Goodrich was born in the old Hancock house, Boston, Massachusetts, June 1, 1830. She was the oldest daughter of the Hon. Samuel Griswold Goodrich. Her mother was Miss Mary Boott, of an English family of position.\nHer great-grandfather was James Ely, of Lyme, Connecticut, a Revolutionary officer. Thomas Welles, former Colonial Governor of Connecticut, was another ancestor. Mrs. Smith was a direct descendant of soldiers of the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War , and the wife of an officer of the civil war.\nBeing obliged to go abroad, Emily's parents placed her in the Inglis-McCleod school. Her education continued later in France and Italy, where every opportunity for study was given her, and she became an accomplished linguist. In 1846, in Paris, she was presented at the court of Louis Philippe I and saw the throne of the \"citizen king\" broken and burned in the French Revolution of 1848. At that time, she took her first lesson in caring for the wounded. The court of the hotel was filled with men shot down by the soldiery. A mob of 90,000 controlled the city three days. For 20 hours, Alphonse de Lamartine held them by his eloquence, and Miss Goodrich stood on a balcony near when the rabble hurled down a statue and thrust him into its niche.\nWhile her father was Consul in Paris, she assisted her mother in entertaining foreign and domestic dignitaries. In the days so alarming for all Paris, the American Consulate and Mr. Goodrich's house were filled with terror-stricken foreigners, who found their only place of safety under the protection of the American flag.\nMiss Goodrich was presented at the Court of St James's at the time of the first Great Exhibition.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1856, she returned to the United States and married Nathaniel Smith (d. 1877), of Connecticut, a grandson of Nathan Smith who was Senator in the days when Congress sat in Philadelphia, and chief justice of Connecticut. The young couple went to live in Newburgh, New York, where her husband engaged in law. The panic of 1857 drove her husband back to Woodbury, where they lived in the Smith house, which was destroyed January 2, 1885, with all its priceless treasures.\nIn 1861, Mrs. Smith followed her husband to the civil war, where she remained with him for two years. He was injured in an explosion, but his death did not occur till some years after the war had ended. \"Mrs. Colonel\", as the soldiers called her, was mentioned in the State reports as being very efficient in tent and hospital.\nShe wrote many stories and some verse for various magazines. During her years in Paris and the stirring times thereafter, she was correspondent of a New York City daily. Her letters during the war and accounts of the Centennial Exposition were widely read and copied.\nFor many years, she lived in Woodbury, Connecticut but later moved to Waterbury, Connecticut. From 1873 til 1893, she was more or less connected with the newspapers, and was for two years secretary of the large correspondence association of the American. \nIn 1883, to help others, she became a co-founder of the CLSC, and she was one of ten in Connecticut who, in 1891, were enrolled in the highest order of Chautauqua degrees. When Mount Vernon was to be purchased by the women of America, Smith was appointed first vice-regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association for Connecticut, and her daughter was one of her most valued assistants. She was also a member of Millicent Porter Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, of Waterbury. She was also an agent for the Humane Society.\n\n\n== Death ==\nEmily Goodrich Smith died at Waterbury, Connecticut, July 12, 1903.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"'Peter Parley'-As Known To His Daughter.\", The Connecticut Magazine, 1898\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Emily L.

Made up of two galaxies, UGC 1840 NED01 (PGC 9060) and UGC 1840 NED02 (PGC 9062), the two galaxies had recently collided with each other in which the elliptical galaxy has penetrated through the spiral galaxy's nucleus leaving a hole in its middle, thus forming a ring galaxy. With a diameter of 1.3 arc minutes, close to 100,000 thousand light-years, they are roughly the same size as the Milky Way.\nBoth galaxies are included in Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies which was created by Halton Arp. They fall under the category of objects that have emanating material and both classified as galaxies that have ring systems.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rainbow Mountain is a 6,841-foot-elevation (2,085-meter) summit in Alaska, United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nRainbow Mountain is located 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Paxson in the Delta Mountains which are a subrange of the Alaska Range. It is the highest point of Rainbow Ridge. Precipitation runoff and glacial meltwater from the mountain's slopes drains into tributaries of the Delta River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 4,200 feet (1,280 meters) above the Richardson Highway and Phelan Creek in 1.5 mile (2.4 km), and 3,200 feet (975 meters) above the Canwell Glacier in two miles (3.2 km). The Richardson Highway traverses the western base of Rainbow Ridge for approximately three miles, with the mountain's summit about midway along the ridge. Dall sheep and hoary marmot on the ridge can be seen from the highway.\nThe mountain is so named because of multi-colored talus which slides down its face, and the descriptive toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Yellow, pink, and green colors are from volcanic eruptions 300 to 350 million years ago, whereas brown and gray colors are from sandstone, siltstone and limestone layers. Minerals present include chrysocolla, serpentinite, hematite, chromite, quartz, calcite, pyrite, and malachite. Rainbow Ridge is an excellent site for collecting fossils of trilobites which are about 315 million years old. \n\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Rainbow Mountain is located in a tundra climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems are forced upwards by the Delta Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below 0 °F with wind chill factors below −10 °F. This climate supports the Canwell Glacier and McCallum Glacier surrounding the peak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeography of Alaska\n Mountains portal\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRainbow Mountain: weather forecast",

        "content": "Michelle Polzine is an American pastry chef, author, and former owner of the 20th Century Café in San Francisco, California.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPolzine was born in November, 1969 and was raised in Southern California.  Starting at age 19 she worked as a political activist, first in Portland, Oregon on behalf of an environmental organization, then later for a women's clinic based in San Francisco.  In 1991, at the age of 22, Polzine relocated to North Carolina, and entered the restaurant industry as a dishwasher before eventually being offered positions preparing food.  After developing skills as a baker at several restaurants in Durham and Chapel Hill, Polzine returned to San Francisco to continue her culinary career in 2002. \nPolzine opened the 20th Century Café, which focused on her interpretation of Eastern and Central European baked goods, in San Francisco in 2013.  She authored the cookbook Baking at the 20th Century Cafe: Iconic European Desserts from Linzer Torte to Honey Cake, which was published in 2020.\nPolzine was diagnosed with, and treated for, clear cell carcinoma in 2020.   Citing both her recovery from this procedure and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food industry, Polzine permanently closed the 20th Century Café in 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPolzine has been noted for her vintage style, favoring fashions from the 1930s to 1950's.  She is married to Franz Kunst and currently resides in San Francisco.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPolzine was a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's Outstanding Pastry Chef award in 2010, 2018, and 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goris Cave Dwellings also called Khndzoresk are a distinctive architectural feature nestled within the Syunik Province of Armenia, specifically in the town of Goris. Carved directly into the soft volcanic rock formations characteristic of the region, these cave dwellings represent a unique integration of human habitation with the natural landscape.\n\n\n= Background =\nThe earliest inhabitants of the caves were likely indigenous peoples who sought refuge in the natural shelters provided by the rocky terrain. Over time, as communities grew and evolved, so too did the caves, with inhabitants expanding and modifying them to meet their changing needs.\nDuring the medieval period, Goris Cave Dwellings became more prominent as populations increased and settlements flourished in the region. The caves served as not only residential spaces but also as centers of commerce, culture, and community life. They provided protection from external threats and offered a sense of security in an often-unforgiving environment.\nThroughout history, Goris Cave Dwellings witnessed the ebb and flow of various civilizations, including the Kingdom of Urartu, the Persian Empire, and later, the Russian and Ottoman Empires. Each successive wave of settlers left its mark on the caves, contributing to their cultural and architectural diversity.\nIn the modern era, Goris Cave Dwellings continue to be inhabited by local residents, many of whom maintain a deep connection to their ancestral roots. While some caves have been adapted for contemporary use, others remain as they have for generations, serving as poignant reminders of Armenia's ancient heritage.",

        "content": "\"Quiero\" (transl. \"I Want\") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Jerry Rivera from his 11th studio album Rivera, (2001). The song was co-written by Martha Cancel, Ray Contreras, and James Nicholas Greco and produced by Bebu Silvetti. It is a pop ballad in which the singer pays homage to women. A salsa version of the track was also recorded which was arranged and produced by Ramón Sánchez. It was released in January 2001 as the lead single from the album in January 2001. A music video was directed by Juan Basanta and features Rivera in various background flirting with a woman.\nThe song received positive reactions from music critics who felt it was one of the best tracks in the album. It was nominated in the category of Tropical Song of the Year at the 2002 Lo Nuestro Awards and was a recipient of both the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Latin Award and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Latin Award in 2002. Commercially, it topped the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, Latin Pop Airplay, and Tropical Airplay charts in the United States.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nSince the 1990s, Jerry Rivera has been one of the most successful salsa artists with songs such as \"Cara de Niño\" and \"Amores Como el Nuestro\" becoming hits in the genre. In 2000, Rivera released his 10th studio album, Para Siempre, another salsa record launched by Sony Discos. In April 2000, Rivera announced that his next album would consist of pop ballads that would be produced by Argentine musician Bebu Silvetti and released the follow year with his new record label BMG US Latin. According to Rivera, he had just planned to record ballads and didn't expect a full-length album. Recording for the album, titled Rivera, took place in Miami, Florida.\nThe opening track \"Quiero\" was composed by Martha Cancel, Ray Contreras, and James Nicholas Greco. The track is a romantic pop ballad which Rivera describes it as a \"tribute to one of God's most beautiful creations, women\". He further explained the theme of the song which is \"dedicated to the greatest thing, which is women, to how important she is, to what one can become with her and cannot achieve without her\". A salsa version of the track was also recorded for the album which arranged and produced by Ramón Sánchez.\n\n\n== Promotion and reception ==\n\"Quiero\" was released as the lead single from Rivera in January 2001. A music video was filmed for the ballad version and was directed by Juan Basanta; it features the artist in various places including a flower field, a waterfall, and a party in a house where he flirts with a woman. It also served as the main theme for the Mexican telenovela El noveno mandamiento (2001). Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine called it and \"Muero\" the album's \"standouts\" and complimented the artist for \"letting loose with persuasive pathos\". The Houston Chronicle critic Ramiro Burr stated Rivera \"pours a variety of emotional shadings into torchy numbers\" including \"Quiero, \"Muero\", and \"Que Queda de Nuestra Amor\". Burr also felt the singer's decision to record the salsa version was also \"wisely included\". An editor for Latin Style magazine called the salsa version the best track in the album. Writing for Hanford Sentinel, Ricardo Cores commented that on \"Quiero\", \"you can see an evolving singer who interprets the ballad genre with feeling and depth\".\nThe track was nominated in the category of Tropical Song of the Year at the 14th Annual Lo Nuestro Awards in 2002, but ultimately lost to \"Cómo Olvidar\" by Olga Tañón. It was recognized as recognized as one of the best-performing songs of the year at the 2002 ASCAP Latin Awards on the tropical field as well as in the BMI Latin Awards in the same year. Commercially, \"Quiero\" topped the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart as well as its subcharts, the Latin Pop Airplay and Tropical Airplay chart in the US.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one Billboard Hot Latin Tracks of 2001\nList of Billboard Latin Pop Airplay number ones of 2001\nList of Billboard Tropical Airplay number ones of 2001\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Scottish Mother's Day, also known as Mothering Sunday, is a significant cultural and religious observance in Scotland. It is celebrated on the fourth Sunday of Lent, three weeks before Easter Sunday. While its origins are rooted in Christian traditions, Scottish Mother's Day has evolved into a secular celebration that honors mothers and motherhood.\nThe history of Scottish Mother's Day can be traced back to the medieval period when it was customary for people to return to their \"mother church\" – the main church or cathedral in their area – on the fourth Sunday of Lent. This practice, known as \"going a-mothering,\" provided an opportunity for families to reunite and for individuals to visit their mothers and present them with small gifts or flowers.\nOver time, the religious significance of Mothering Sunday diminished, and the focus shifted towards celebrating maternal figures. Today, Scottish Mother's Day is a time for expressing appreciation and gratitude towards mothers, grandmothers, stepmothers, and other maternal figures who play important roles in people's lives.\nTraditionally, Scottish Mother's Day is marked by various customs and activities. Many people choose to spend quality time with their mothers, treating them to special meals or outings. It is also common to give gifts such as flowers, chocolates, or cards to show love and appreciation.\nIn addition to honoring individual mothers, Scottish Mother's Day is a time to recognize the contributions of all mothers to society. It is a day to acknowledge the sacrifices they make and the love and support they provide to their families.\nWhile Scottish Mother's Day shares similarities with Mother's Day celebrations in other countries, it also has its own unique customs and traditions that reflect Scotland's rich cultural heritage. Whether it's a simple gesture of thanks or a grand celebration, Scottish Mother's Day serves as a reminder to cherish and celebrate the special bond between mothers and their children.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edmund L. Daley (November 1, 1883 – December 19, 1968) was a career officer in the United States Army. A veteran of the Moro Rebellion, Pancho Villa Expedition, World War I and World War II, he was a recipient of the  Army Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, French Order of Agricultural Merit (Officer), and Greek Order of the Redeemer (Gold Cross). Daley was assigned to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and his command postings included the 55th Engineer Regiment, 6th Engineer Regiment, Pittsburgh Engineer District, Upper Mississippi Valley Engineer Division, North Atlantic Engineer Division, First Coast Artillery District, Puerto Rican Department, and V Corps.\nA native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Daley graduated from high school in 1901 and obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy (West Point) as a member of the class of 1906. His high graduation rank (fifth of 78) enabled him to obtain the assignment to the Corps of Engineers, and his early postings included Fort Mason, California and duty in the Philippines. As he continued to advance through the ranks, he served on the West Point faculty and attended the Army Service Schools (now the United States Army Command and General Staff College). During the First World War, he commanded the 6th Engineer Regiment, which he led during several offensives. Post-war assignments included the Harbord Commission in Turkey and Armenia, the Allied High Mission to Armenia, executive with the American Relief Administration that took part in relieving the Russian famine of 1921–1922, and deputy commissioner in Greece for the American Red Cross mission that implemented the Treaty of Lausanne to end the Greco-Turkish War of 1919 to 1922.\nDaley was promoted to brigadier general after his graduation from the United States Army War College, and his senior assignments included command of Puerto Rican Department and V Corps. He was a major general when he was named to command United States Army Forces in Northern Ireland at the start of World War II, but the posting was subsequently withdrawn, and Daley opted to retire as a brigadier general. After retiring from the army, he resided in Albany, New York, where he served as New York State Deputy Director of Civil Defense and New York State Deputy Director of Veterans Affairs until retiring permanently in the mid-1950s. Daley died in Albany on December 19, 1968 and was buried at West Point Cemetery.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEdmund Leo Daley was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on November 1, 1883, the son of John J. Daley and Katherine Elizabeth (Martin) Daley. He was raised and educated in Worcester, and was a 1901 graduate of Worcester's Classical High School.\nAfter his high school graduation, Daley competed for a congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He scored highest on the examination offered by Representative John R. Thayer and received the appointment. Daley attended West Point from 1902 to 1906, and graduated fifth in his class of 78. Among his classmates who also became general officers were Jonathan M. Wainwright, Adna R. Chaffee Jr., Frank Maxwell Andrews, and Cortlandt Parker. He received his commission as a second lieutenant of Engineers and was posted to Fort Mason, California.\n\n\n== Start of career ==\nAt Fort Mason, Daley was assigned to command Company D, 1st Engineer Battalion. From November 1907 to February 1908, he performed detached duty with surveying parties in the Philippines during the Moro Rebellion. He then resumed command of Company D, which he led at Fort William McKinley, Philippines until January 1909. Upon returning to the United States, he was a student at the Washington Barracks Engineer School until graduating in October 1910. He received promotion to first lieutenant in October 1909.\nAfter graduating from the Engineer School, Daley resumed command of D Company, 1st Engineers, this time at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. In August 1911, he was assigned to the West Point faculty as an instructor in the Engineering Department, where he remained through August 1915. Daley was promoted to captain. From August 1915 to May 1916, Daley was a student in the Field Engineer Course at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Army Service Schools (now the United States Army Command and General Staff College). From May 1916 to June 1917, Daley was district engineer, depot engineer, and officer in charge of railway operations for the Laredo, Texas Engineer District, and oversaw rail transportation of soldiers and supplies during the Pancho Villa Expedition. He was promoted to major in June 1917.\n\n\n== Continued career ==\nAt the start of World War I, Daley was assigned to Vancouver Barracks as senior instructor at the first Officers' Training Camp for engineers, and he served from June to August 1917. In August 1917, he received promotion to temporary lieutenant colonel and was assigned to the 310th Engineer Regiment during its organization and training at Camp Custer, Michigan. In March 1918, he was assigned to command the 55th Engineer Regiment at Camp Custer and in April 1918 he was promoted to temporary colonel. He led this regiment to France, and in June 1918 was assigned to command the 6th Engineer Regiment while serving concurrently as engineer officer on the staff of the 3rd Division. He participated in the August 1918 Aisne-Marne offensive, September 1918 Battle of Saint-Mihiel, and the September to November 1918 Meuse–Argonne offensive, and remained in command after the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war.\nFollowing the armistice, Daley took part in the Occupation of the Rhineland, then performed engineering duties at locations in France including the Le Mans Embarkation Area. From August to October 1919, he served with the Harbord Commission in Turkey and Armenia. From October 1919 to June 1920, he was a member of the Allied High Mission to Armenia, and served as military governor of the provinces of Nakhchivan and Sharur. In April 1920, he returned to his permanent rank of major. When he returned to the United States in July 1920, Daley traveled with a Polish American contingent of the Blue Army, a Polish force that took part in the war in Europe.\nFrom August 1920 to August 1922, Daley served again on the West Point faculty, this time as professor of practical military engineering. From August to December 1922, he was an executive with the American Relief Administration, the Herbert Hoover-led effort to relieve the Russian famine of 1921–1922. From January to July 1923, Daley was deputy commissioner in Greece for the American Red Cross during implementation of the Treaty of Lausanne that resolved the Greco-Turkish War of 1919 to 1922.\n\n\n== Later career ==\n\nFrom August 1923 to August 1926, Daley was engineer officer of the Pittsburgh Engineer District. From August 1926 to August 1930, he served as assistant to the Chief of Engineers, with responsibility for the office's Permit Section and Rivers and Harbors Section. He received promotion to lieutenant colonel in November 1929. From September 1930 to November 1933, Daley was assistant division engineer for the Upper Mississippi Valley Engineer Division, and he was division engineer from November 1933 to August 1935, when he was promoted to colonel.\nFrom August 1935 to June 1936, Daley was a student at the United States Army War College. After graduating, he was engineer officer of the 1st Engineer District of New York, a posting he held from June 1936 to June 1937. From June 1937 to September 1938, he served as engineer officer of the North Atlantic Engineer Division. In October 1938, Daley was promoted to brigadier general. He served as commander of the 1st Coast Artillery District from October 1938 to June 1939.\nIn July 1939, Daley was assigned to command the army's Puerto Rican Department. He served in this assignment until March 1941. From March to April 1941, he commanded of the 2nd Infantry Division, but with the army expanding after U.S. entry into World War II, he was quickly reassigned to command U.S. V Corps. He led the corps during organization and training at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana until September 1942, and was promoted to major general in May 1942. He was slated to command United States Army Forces in Northern Ireland, but the assignment was subsequently withdrawn by Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, who indicated he had received several reports indicating Daley's leadership style was not conducive to exercising high-level command, and insinuated a troubling personal failing, possibly alcoholism. Daley then requested retirement, and he left the army with the retired rank of brigadier general in September 1942.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nDaley's foreign awards included the Order of Agricultural Merit (Officer) (France) and Order of the Redeemer (Gold Cross) (Greece). His U.S. awards included the Army Distinguished Service Medal and Silver Star.\n\n\n=== Army Distinguished Service Medal citation ===\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel (Corps of Engineers) Edmund Leo Daley, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. Colonel Daley served with distinction as Division Engineer of the 3d Division and as Commanding Officer of the 6th Engineers.

        "content": "Peperomia enervis is a plant in the pepper family Piperaceae found only in rainforests of northeast Queensland near the cities of Cairns and Mackay. It was first described in 1891.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPeperomia enervis is a small succulent herb up to 30 cm (12 in) high. The stems are initially erect but after a time will lay down and produce roots from the nodes. The small glabrous leaves measure about 15 mm (0.59 in) long by 8 mm (0.31 in) wide, and are arranged either in opposite pairs or in whorls of three. They are carried on petioles about 1–4 mm (0.04–0.16 in) long, and the secondary venation is obscure.\nThe flowers  are minute, measuring less than 1 mm (0.04 in) across, and are borne on terminal spikes about 5 cm (2.0 in) long. They are sunken into the axis of the inflorescence and lack both petals and sepals. The stigma is borne obliquely on the ovary and there are two stamens, one either side of the ovary. The fruit is, in botanical terms, a berry about 1 mm (0.04 in) diameter, dark brown in colour and containing a single seed.\n\n\n=== Phenology ===\nFlowering occurs between January and May, and fruits ripen from April to July.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first described by the botanists Ferdinand von Mueller and Casimir de Candolle in a paper titled Descriptions of new Australian plants, with occasional other annotations, and published in the journal The Victorian Naturalist in 1891.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe genus name Peperomia comes from the Ancient Greek words piperi \"pepper\", and homós  \"same\", referring to its close relationship to the pepper genus Piper. The species epithet enervis means \"without veins\", a reference to the obscure venation of the leaves.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nPeperomia enervis is found in two disjunct populations in Queensland - the larger one is within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area near Cairns, and a smaller one in and around the Eungella National Park, west of Mackay. It grows on tree trunks and moss covered rocks in high altitude rainforest to about 1,200 m (3,900 ft).\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species is listed as least concern under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act. As of 22 April 2024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nView a map of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\nView observations of this species on iNaturalist\nView images of this species on Flickriver.com",

It is an erect, compact shrub with egg-shaped to narrowly egg-shaped leaves and white, tube-shaped flowers with hairy lobes.\n\n\n== Description ==\nStyphelia xerophylla is an erect, compact shrub that typically grows up to 60 cm (24 in) high and wide, with hairy branchlets from near the base of the plant. The leaves are narrowly egg-shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 5–20 mm (0.20–0.79 in) long and 1.6–3.8 mm (0.063–0.150 in) wide, with a sharply pointed tip. The flowers are born singly in leaf axils, with bracts 1.8–2.8 mm (0.071–0.110 in) and bracteoles 3.0–4.2 mm (0.12–0.17 in) long at the base. The sepals are 7.5–9.0 mm (0.30–0.35 in) long and 3.0–4.3 mm (0.12–0.17 in) wide. The petals are white, joined at the base forming a tube 6.0–8.2 mm (0.24–0.32 in) long and with lobes that are shorter than the tube, 4.0–5.2 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and densely hairy.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1839 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who gave it the name Stomarrhena xerophylla in his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis from specimens collected near the Swan River Colony by James Drummond. In 1867, Ferdinand von Mueller transferred the species to Styphelia as S. xerophylla in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (xerophylla) means \"dry-\" or \"parched-leaved\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species mostly grows in sandy soils in Banksia woodland or heathland in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nStyphelia xerophylla is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The flag of San Diego County was adopted in February 1957, although an actual specimen would not be created until September 1957. It features the San Diego County seal adopted in 1937 centered on a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and green.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1956, a committee consisting of John Davidson, County Purchasing Agent Verne Gehringer, and Director of Parks and Recreation Cletus Gardner, conducted a study for the design of an official flag for the County. Gardner wrote in a memo to the Board on February 14, 1957 that \"One of the original reasons for this [sic] designing was to have an official County flag hanging in the Board Chambers.\"\nThe Board formally adopted a drawing of the flag on February 18, 1957. Secor presented the completed, hand-sewn flag to the Board of Supervisors on September 10, 1957. Later in 1962, the Board directed that the hand-fabricated official flag of the County by Mrs. Secor, be thoroughly cleaned and permanently enclosed in a glass case in the Board Chamber. The original County flag is still on display in the Board Chamber, Room 310 at the County Administration Center, 1600 Pacific Highway, San Diego, California 92101. The U.S. flag, Californian state flag, and County flag are all displayed at most County facilities.The following is a copy of the resolution approving the County flag.\nOn February 18, 1957, the Board of Supervisors adopted an official flag for the County of San Diego. The flag features the County seal on a field of white, bordered at the top by a band of red, and at the bottom by a band of green, significant of the territory of San Diego County having been under the control of King Charles of Spain, the Republic of Mexico, the Republic of California, and the United States of America. The County flag was designed by Estelle Secor, a former County employee in the Road Department.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nThe colors red, white, and green symbolize the city's Spanish and Mexican past.\nThe seal on the flag was designed by architect Samuel W. Hamill and adopted in 1937, replacing a seal that was in use since 1933. It depicts a double-headed axe rising from a bundle of sticks, which served as a symbol of authority in ancient Rome. Also included in the seal are the stars and stripes of the United States, a stylized dolphin representing the fruits of the sea, and a horn of plenty representing the fruits of the land. A clipper ship recalls San Diego's historic background of the sea, and the airplane looks into the future. Mt. Palomar Observatory represents a world renowned achievement in science and San Diego's position on the threshold of scientific history. The observatory overlooks an orange grove, which reflects the agricultural riches of the county. Encircling the seal is the motto \"The Noblest Motive is the Public Good\"--a quotation from Virgil that was chosen by the Building Committee as the motto to adorn the Civic Center Building. At the bottom is the date 1851, which is the date the county was founded.\nThe seal's design elicited some confusion among citizens who did not understand what it was meant to represent. One citizen commented \"this emblem which is to adorn the Civic Center... represents nothing in the Heavens above, nor the Earth beneath, but is an object of mirth to you men. Still since it is to cost the tax payers 1,000 bucks it is nothing to make merry over.\" Despite such complaints, the seal was officially adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 1937, replacing an earlier seal that had been chosen in 1933. It adorned the northern entrance to the Civic Center until the city moved out in 1964, when it was also placed over the southern entrance.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFlag of San Diego\n\n\n== References ==",

He completed a PhD in nuclear physics.\nA two-time Oxford blue, Waldron was the victim of a biting incident while playing for Oxford University against the touring Wallabies in 1966, leaving him bloodied. The injury required numerous stitches and was later revealed to have been caused by Wallaby hooker Ross Cullen, who was send home by Australian team management. He also played for London Irish and was capped three times by Ireland, appearing twice in the 1966 Five Nations as a lock against Scotland and Wales at Lansdowne Road, then once against the Wallabies in a 1968 home international, this time used as a prop.\nWaldron is a former CEO of Dragon Oil, retiring after the company was acquired by Emirates National Oil Company.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOllie Waldron at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "2019 was the twelfth competitive season for the Cairns based Northern Pride Rugby League Football Club. They were one of 14 clubs that played in the twenty-third season of Queensland's top rugby league competition, QRL's Intrust Super Cup, with each team playing 12 home games and 11 away games over 24 weeks between March and August.\nChannel 9 continued to be the television broadcast provider, but televised games returned to Sunday afternoons, after the Saturday afternoon slot proved unpopular, with viewing figures having slumped by as much as 50,000 a game in 2018. Games were shown at noon for the first four weeks, then, when Daylight Saving Time ended in New South Wales, games were shown at 1:00pm.\nThis was Ty Williams' third season as coach. The Pride lost more than 500 games of QCup experience during the off-season, with the retirement of captain Ryan Ghietti (169 games), along with Brett Anderson (125+ games), Colin Wilkie, Sheldon Powe-Hobbs and Justin Castellaro. In addition, Ethan Lowe*, a Cowboys' regular, signed with the Rabbitohs, leaving another gap in the roster. The Pride signed experienced second-rower Maurice 'Bobby' Blair, and promoted several young players into the first grade squad - Steven Tatipata, Evan Child, Terrence Casey-Douglas, \nTom Hancock and Dave Murphy were named as joint co-captains. Jared Allen and Jack Campagnolo were co-captains in the second pre-season trial game.\nThe Pride started the season well, beating last year's premiers, Redcliffe and the PNG Hunters in the first two rounds, but then they lost the nest ten games, a club record, with a 50-10 thrashing from the SC Falcons and a 43-0 defeat by Burleigh.  They managed to finish the season in a competitive fashion, pulling off a thrilling comeback to defeat Easts Tigers 18-16 in their last home game, before narrowly falling to Tweed Seagulls 12-10 in the final round. The Pride won just five games and ended up in twelfth place.\n\n\n== 2019 Season -  Northern Pride ==\n\nCompetition: Intrust Super Cup.\nSponsor: 'Mount Peter Estate' (Kenfrost Homes).\n\n\n=== Staff ===\n\n\n==== Coaches/Trainers ====\nCoach: Ty Williams\nAssistant Coach: Sam Obst\nAssistant Coach: Bobby Berg\nStrength & Conditioning Coach: Scott Callaghan\n\n\n==== Captains ====\nCo-Captains: Tom Hancock and Dave Murphy.\nTrial game co-captains: Jared Allen and Jack Campagnolo.\n\n\n==== Managers ====\nFootball Operations Manager: Chey Bird\nAdministration, Marketing & Memberships Member: Alannah Giuffrida\nMedia Manager: Gavin Broomhead\nGameday Commentator: Elliott Lovejoy\nChief executive: Mark Quinn\nChairman: Tony Williamson\nBoard of Directors: Peter Parr (Cowboys), Gail Andrejic (finance), Stephen Tillett, Stephen Devenish, Terry Medhurst, Jodi Scott.\n\n\n== Squad ==\n\n\n=== 2019 player gains ===\n\n\n=== Player losses after 2018 season ===\n\n\n=== 2019 season launch ===\nPre-season training: 12 November 2018.\nPre-season Boot Camp: Mystery Destination, 1-3 February 2018\nSeason launch: Mamu Link Park, Mount Peter Residential Estate, Edmonton, Saturday 2 March 2019, 10:00am-1:00pm.\n\n\n=== Trial matches ===\n\n\n=== Intrust Super Cup matches ===\n\n\n== 2019 ladder ==\n\n\n=== Northern Pride (regular season 2019) ===\nWin = 5 (4 of 11 home games, 1 of 12 away games)\nLoss = 18 (7 of 11 home games, 11 of 12 away games)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website: northernpride.com.au\nNorthern Pride RLFC on Facebook\nNorthern Pride RLFC on Instagram\nNorthern Pride RLFC's channel on YouTube\nNorthern Pride RLFC on TikTok\nNorthern Pride RLFC on Twitter",

        "content": "Scaralina aethrinsula is a species of planthopper in the family Fulgoridae. It is found from Idaho in the United States south to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is one of four species (the others being Scaralina cristata, Scaralina marmorata, and Scaralina metcalfi) that were, for several decades, erroneously grouped together under a single name, Alphina glauca; this name is now treated as a synonym of S. marmorata.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nScaralina aethrinsula typically occurs at higher elevations, above 1000 meters, and is associated with oaks (Quercus spp.). It has been reared on Quercus arizonica, but this may not be its preferred host species. Adults are readily and commonly attracted to blacklights.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nScaralina aethrinsula is most often found in the Madrean Sky Islands in Arizona, but also extending east of the Continental Divide into the Magdalena and Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico, north and west into Utah and Idaho, and south into the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state of Chihuahua. In Arizona, its range overlaps the ranges of Scaralina cristata and Scaralina metcalfi, and all three species can be found together.\n\n\n== References ==",

To promote his educational \"Plastic Method\" he made a handbook that included several photographs that displayed various stages of creative projects. The images suggest phases of motion or change, but the book probably did not have a direct influence on claymation films. Still, the plasticine product would become the favourite  product for clay animators, as it did not dry and harden (unlike normal clay) and was much more malleable than its harder and greasier Italian predecessor plasteline.\nThe first use of time-lapse photography in a feature film was in Georges Méliès' motion picture Carrefour De L'Opera (1897).\nBy 1897, German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing had a first prototype of their toy \"kinematograph\".  It would later be used for traced pictures from live-action films (much like the later rotoscoping technique). \n\n\n== Births ==\n\n\n=== February ===\nFebruary 24: Vyacheslav Levandovsky, Ukrainian animator, considered the founder of Ukrainian animation, (The Fairy Tale of the Straw Bull, The Tale about the Squirrel Hostess and the Mouse Villain, Tuk-Tuk and his friend Zhuk, In the Land of Dolls), (d. 1962).\n\n\n=== March ===\nMarch 7: Cy Young, Chinese-American special effects animator, (Walt Disney Company), (d. 1964). \n\n\n=== May ===\nMay 18: Frank Capra, Italian-born American director, producer and writer (creator of Private Snafu, directed Our Mr. Sun and Hemo the Magnificent), (d. 1991).\n\n\n=== July ===\nJuly 11: Bernice Hansen, American voice actress, (voice of Tillie Tiger in Elmer Elephant, Petunia Pig, Cookie and Little Kitty in the Looney Tunes franchise, continued voice of Andy Panda and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, provided squeaks for Mickey Mouse), (d. 1981). \n\n\n=== September ===\nSeptember 16: Milt Franklyn, American composer and arranger, (Looney Tunes),  (d. 1962).\n\n\n=== October ===\nOctober 25: Luigi Pavese, Italian voice actor, (provided the Italian voices of Colonel Hathi in The Jungle Book , Boris in Lady and the Tramp, and a Labrador Retriever in One Hundred and One Dalmatians),  (d. 1969).\n\n\n=== December ===\nDecember 5: Tina Lattanzi, Italian voice actress (provided the Italian voices of the Evil Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, and Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty), (d. 1997).\nDecember 9: Hermione Gingold, English actress (voice of Mme.

        "content": "Noah Sebastian (born in Richmond, Virginia on October 31, 1995) is an American singer and songwriter, known for being the lead singer of the rock band Bad Omens. He is also the group's main songwriter and producer alongside guitarist Joakim Karlsson.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAt age 12, Noah Sebastian joined an Enter Shikari cover band. Inspired by the bands The Plot in You and Beartooth, at the age of 16 he began learning how to produce and compose music. In 2013, he left the band he played as a guitarist in Washington, D.C. and formed Man Vs. Self, later renamed Bad Omens. After listening to a demo tape, Sumerian Records offered the group a contract and Sebastian recruited a full lineup for the band. After the release of the singles \"Glass Houses\" and \"Exit Wounds\", the group went on their first tour in 2016. Their follow-up single, \"The Worst of Me\", reached one million streams shortly after its release.\nIn June 2023, the singer participated in the Artist Friendly podcast along with Joel Madden. In October, Bad Omens had to cancel live performances due to Sebastian's health problems. On Bad Omens' joint tour with Bring Me the Horizon in 2024, he joined the stage during their show to sing \"Antivist\" with Oliver Sykes. In January 2024, Bad Omens released the single \"V.A.N\" in collaboration with singer Poppy, the vocals were performed solely by her.\n\n\n== Musical style and composition ==\nSebastian wrote Bad Omens' biggest hit \"Just Pretend\", which went viral and was certified gold by RIAA, and also directed its music video. He said that the song was originally written in a satirical way to fit the formula of a song that would be successful — which is what happened. However, the vocals pleased him, and Bad Omens tweaked the song to suit the band.\nIn an interview with Kerrang! magazine, he stated that he produces music based on what he likes, not what is successful and that he seeks to create music that is different from other bands. For NME, the self-taught singer said he strived to improve his vocal skills during the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of this, The Death of Peace of Mind was produced around vocals.\nBad Omens' self-titled album was widely compared to Bring Me the Horizon's Sempiternal, and Sebastian said that in fact the band was one of his biggest inspirations.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSebastian grew up in Richmond, Virginia, United States with his family consisting of his mother and grandparents. At age 15, he stopped attending school and left home, moving in with friends.\nHe told Crunchyroll that he usually watches anime; as a child, he watched Naruto and became a fan of the series. He also mentioned Elfen Lied as one of his favorites. When asked how this influenced his music, he said that in a collaboration with EDM artist Kazyo he used a quote from Naruto.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBad Omens (2016)\nFinding God Before God Finds Me (2019)\nThe Death of Peace of Mind (2022)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Museo dell'Accademia Etrusca (Museum of the Etruscan Academy) is a public archeological museum housed in the Palazzo Casali, also known as the town's Palazzo Pretorio, located in the historic center of Cortona, province of Arezzo, region of Tuscany, Italy. The museum entrance faces Piazza Signorelli, and is one house east of a facade of city hall (Palazzo Comunale) and sits west across Via Casali from the Teatro Signorelli. This was one of the first public museums in Italy. Now linked with the Civic Art museum of Cortona, the complex is known as the MAEC (Museo dell’Accademia Etrusca e della Città di Cortona),\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe 18th-century spawned a renewed interest in an Italian, if not Tuscan, antiquity; to many the most autochthonous antiquity in Tuscany was assigned to the Etruscans. In Cortona, this coalesced to form the Etruscan Academy, which originated as a literate \"Society for the purchase of books\" founded by the Venuti brothers in 1726. The next year, the academy was constituted as the Accademia di Scienze et Erudizioni. Abbot Onofrio Baldelli, a collector of rocks, fossils, and Etruscan antiquities donated his collections to group. In 1728, it became the Accademia Etrusca delle Antichità ed Iscrizioni. The initial donation included a pair of globes (terrestrial and celestial) dated 1714–15, and another celestial globe dated 1710.\nThe Library of the academy, in the same building as the Museum, possessed manuscripts, codexes and parchments dating as old as the 11th through the 19th century, rare printed texts from the 15th and 16th centuries and thousands of volumes from later times.\nThe Palazzo Casali in which the collection was held was built by the 13th-century by the Casali family, who resided here from 1325 to 1409, while they were then lords of Cortona. When Cortona became property of Tuscany, this palace housed the appointed captains, and was known as the Palazzo Pretorio. The heraldic shields displayed on its external walls belonged to the various leaders. Starting from 1728 the main floor (piano nobile) hosted the Accademia Etrusca and its Museum.\nThe two underground floors, that were prisons in the past, now house the Museum of the Etruscan and Roman City of Cortona. The civic museums of Cortona were re-organized in 2005, forming what is now the MAEC (Museo dell’Accademia Etrusca e della Città di Cortona). The first floor houses the town library BCAE (Biblioteca del Comune) and the historical archive of the academy.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe museum includes:\n\nCorbelli collections of Egyptian archeology\nEtruscan collections include jewelry, statuettes, sarcophagi, amphorae, a bronze chandelier, a golden fibula in the shape of a lion, and the Tabula Cortonensis (a long, 2nd-3rd century BC, apparently notarial Etruscan text in a series of bonze tablets).\nPinacoteca houses a Tondo depicting Madonna and child with Saints Michael, Vincent, Margaret and Mark by Luca Signorelli and a triptych depicting Madonna and child with Saints by Bicci di Lorenzo\nThe museum also displays the Rococo Porcelain piece called the Tempietto Ginori. This elaborate porcelain structure is complex allegory about the passage of the Grand Duchy from Medici to Lorraine rule, donated to the Accademia in 1756 by Marquis Carlo Ginori and manufactured at the Doccia porcelain factory.\nTomassi donation including items in use during 18th-century\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n43°16′32″N 11°59′06″E",

        "content": "Vayda is an American rapper and record producer. After starting her rap career in 2021, she released the mixtapes Breeze and Forrest Gump in 2023.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVayda was born and raised in Decatur, Georgia. Her father is a former rapper who was part of a hip hop group. As a child, she learned to play piano by ear. After receiving a subscription to the production software FruityLoops in high school, she was inspired by mashups on Soulection to become a record producer. She produced remixes that she posted on SoundCloud as well as beats that she sold on Twitter.\nVayda started producing music professionally in 2019 and started rapping in 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic. She released her extended play, VV, in 2022. In 2023, she released the mixtape Breeze, her EP Shade, and performed as an opening act for Veeze. Pitchfork named Breeze as one of the best rap albums of 2023 and Vayda's song \"Jenner\" as one of the best rap songs of 2023. Her mixtape, Forrest Gump, was released on December 8, 2023, with her song \"Hood Zendaya\" released as its lead single in November 2023.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nVayda's songs have been described as trap music, particularly plugg and drill, and dance music. Her songs are often sped-up and around two minutes in length. She has stated that she \"barely [has] any songs that reach two minutes\". For BET, Paul Meara wrote that her lyrics were \"whisper-quiet\" and \"snarky\" and compared her sound to \"FKA Twigs mixed with early 2010's and modern-day Jersey club\". For Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre wrote that her songs were \"lush hybrids of ASMR R&B and airy rap\" that were typically \"not much longer than a minute\". DeAsia Paige, for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, described her voice as \"soft and squeaky\" and her beats as \"sped-up\". Jordan Darville of The Fader wrote that Vayda sounded \"effortlessly cool\" in her music. Tirhakah Love of The Cut wrote that her songs were sample-heavy and \"two-to-three-minute short stories, where she mows over snakes attempting to test her backbone\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Homeland Patriotic Movement (Polish: Ruch Patriotyczny „Ojczyzna”, RPO) was a right-wing electoral coalition created for the 1998 Polish local elections. It was a coalition of numerous right-wing formations as well as an environmentalist party and left-wing trade unions, and sought to present a right-wing alternative to the centre-right Christian-democratic Solidarity Electoral Action. The founding parties of the coalition were a part of the Solidarity Electoral Action in the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, but left it over political and ideological disagreements. The main party in the coalition was the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms, renamed to Bloc for Poland (Polish: Blok dla Polski). Despite running an aggressive and dynamic campaign, the coalition finished 6th and won 3.19% of the popular vote, winning 256 council seats in total (out of 63.767), including 2 out of 855 seats in the voivodeship sejmiks. The coalition dissolved shortly after the election, but its members continued their cooperation, founding the Alternative Social Movement for the 2001 Polish parliamentary election.\nThe coalition presented itself as an anti-establishment, independent force that represented the \"true right\", contrasting itself with the centre-right Solidarity Electoral Action. It opposed the Polish membership in the European Union as well as NATO, arguing for the need to protect Polish agriculture and production from foreign capital, as well as attacking the European Union for neoliberal economic policy. It represented the Catholic-nationalist and traditional-conservative faction of the Polish post-Solidarity movement opposed to the policies of the moderate centre-right government. Despite being described as \"radically right-wing\", the coalition presented a left-wing economic program, decrying wealth inequality and poverty. It opposed privatization and market deregulation, and postulated the need to re-nationalize Polish economy along with providing extensive social welfare and subsidies for unprofitable workplaces. It took a hostile stance to private industry, portraying it as unaccountable and arguing that business owners should not be able to earn 10 times more than their employees.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe coalition was formed from the initiative of the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (BBWR), which was a Christian-democratic, centre-right party formed by the supporters of President Lech Wałęsa. The BBWR was to be the official party of the President Wałęsa and represent his interests and political agenda in the parliament. Wałęsa distanced himself from the party after the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, in which the BBWR massively underperformed, receiving 746,653 votes (5.41% of the popular vote) and narrowly crossing the 5% electoral threshold.\nIn the 1995 Polish presidential election, Wałęsa started out with abysmal approval, but the race soon became competitive as Wałęsa started regaining support over the course of the campaign. However, the numerous right-wing parties and formations were unable to unite themselves in support of Wałęsa, leading to a victory of the post-communist, social-democratic Aleksander Kwaśniewski. Following his defeat, Wałęsa formed the Christian-democratic Christian Democracy of the Third Polish Republic, which joined a new project to unite all centre-right Polish parties under a single banner - the Solidarity Electoral Action.\nWałęsa then appealed to BBWR to withdraw their candidature for the 1997 Polish parliamentary election in favour of endorsing the Solidarity Electoral Action. However, most of the party refused to do so, and ran in the election anyway. The party won 1.36% of the popular vote and failed to cross the 5% electoral threshold, losing all of its seats in the Sejm. In November 1997, the activists of the party transformed the Nonpartisan Bloc for Supprt of Reforms into Bloc for Poland (Polish: Blok Dla Polski).\nIn the 1997 election, the Solidarity Electoral Action gained the plurality of seats and formed a majority government together with the liberal Freedom Union. The new centre-right government pursued free-market reforms and advocated speedy integration of Poland into the European Union as well as NATO. This alienated a fraction of Polish right-wing politicians, with many conservatives and nationalists holding anti-EU and anti-NATO views, along with being critical of the free market to varying degrees. Critical of the course of the new centre-right government, the former Prime Minister Jan Olszewski decided to form the Homeland Patriotic Movement to contest the 1998 local election with a handful of minor right-wing parties that split from the Solidarity Electoral Action.\nOn 28 July 1998, the Bloc for Poland, together with Movement for Reconstruction of Poland (ROP), Confederation of Independent Poland - Patriotic Camp (Polish: Konfederacja Polski Niepodległej - Obóz Patriotyczny, KPN-OP) and the National Association of Pensioners of the Republic of Poland (Polish: Krajowe Porozumienie Emerytów i Rencistów RP, KPEiR RP) signed an agreement to form a coalition for the 1998 local elections. They were then joined by the National Democratic Party (Polish: Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne, SND) associated with the right-wing National Democracy movement as well as the Polish Ecological Party \"Greens\" (Polish: Polska Partia Ekologiczna \"Zieloni\", PPE-Z), an environmentalist party. Some right-leaning trade unions also joined the coalition, such as the Trade Union \"Contra\" (Polish: Związek Zawodowy Kontra). It was also joined by the left-wing populist Free Trade Union \"August 80\".\nThe main electoral opponent of the Homeland Patriotic Movement was the Solidarity Electoral Action, which as a grand coalition of all centre-right parties and movements, tried to unite all right-leaning Polish voters under its banner - by 1998, Polish politics seemed to be consolidating into a two-party system between the centre-right, Christian-democratic Solidarity Electoral Action, and the social-democratic, post-communist Democratic Left Alliance. Attempting to emerge as the 'third force' in the election, the Homeland Patriotic Movement was seen as a right-wing equivalent of the left-wing Social Alliance, which was a coalition of left-wing parties such as Polish People's Party, Labour Union, National Party of Retirees and Pensioners and the Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland. The Social Alliance portrayed itself as the 'independent left' and sought to provide a left-wing alternative to Democratic Left Alliance, while also challenging the emerging two-party system.\nThe coalition ran an aggressive campaign and was highly critical of the Solidarity Electoral Alliance. The coalition bought slots in public television stations, and was mostly represented by the former Prime Minister Jan Olszewski, who accused the Solidarity Electoral Action of betraying right-wing voters and finding a working compromise with former communists instead of persecuting them. He claimed that the party was supposed to \"hold accountable those who ordered the shooting of their own people and sold themselves to foreign powers\". The public service broadcaster, Telewizja Polska, interrupted the coalition's broadcasts in October 1998. Telewizja Polska argued that it had to stop the broadcast as it violating the 'personal rights' of attacked politicians. The National Electoral Commission ruled that Telewizja Polska had no right to interrupt the broadcast. The coalition was praised for its slick and provocative advertisements, full of \"videos with fabricated scenes, in-house studio run by two presenters, factual and positive content\".\nThe main focus of the coalition was the Solidarity Electoral Action, which the Homeland Patriotic Movement decried as \"post-communists posing as conservative opposition\". The coalition particularly attacked the plans of the Solidarity Electoral Action to bring Poland into the European Union and NATO; the RPO opposed Polish membership in both structured and criticized the European Union as a neoliberal institution that wants to build unity on \"money and killing identities\". The coalition stressed the need to protect Polish production and Polish property \"against foreign hands\" and against the \"threat posed by accession to the EU\". Economically however, the RPO ran to the right of the Homeland Patriotic Movement, promoting nationalization, social welfare and social market economy. It condemned privatization and presented it as the main cause for unemployment, as caused by unprofitable workplaces being sold out. The coalition presented itself as one that would protect the workers from unemployment by nationalizing and subsidizing unprofitable workplaces instead of privatizing them, and argued that it would seek to prioritize basic needs of citizens instead of \"glamorous or spectacular projects\" that the Polish government was pursuing.\nThe coalition had its own newspaper, the White Eagle (Polish: Orzeł Biały), which completemented its television advertisements. The party ran on slogans such as \"Fatherland of human affairs\" and \"So much homeland as property and justice\", trying to present its left-leaning economic stances and concern with wealth inequality and economic justice. It had around 14000 members in total and pledged to pursue the economic enfranchisement  of the local population if elected to regional councils. It presented proposals such as cheap communical flats and housing, along with development of education. Despite identifying the Solidarity Electoral Action as its main electoral opponent, the Homeland Patriotic Movement would form local coalitions with it in regions where the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance had an electoral advantage; this coalition took place in places like the Słupsk Voivodeship. Ultimately, the Homeland Patriotic Movement performed best in places where it did form coalitions with the Solidarity Electoral Action.\nThe Homeland Patriotic Movement attracted widespread media attention, mostly thanks to the presence of former Prime Minister Jan Olszewski - its coverage was equal to that of the \"independent left-wing\" Social Alliance. Ultimately however, in the 1998 Polish local elections, the Homeland Patriotic Movement won 3.19% of the popular vote and finished 6th. The result was considered disappointing, especially since the Solidarity Electoral Action was successful in capturing the right-wing vote, finishing first in the election. The Homeland Patriotic Movement was also overtaken by the Polish Family Association (Polish: Stowarzyszenie Rodzina Polska), a National-Catholic coalition supported by the popular Catholic media Radio Maryja. The Polish Family Association won 5.2% of the popular vote. The campaign of the left-wing Social Alliance was considering successful, as it captured 12% of the popular vote and finished third.\nIn total, the coalition won 256 councillor seats in total out of 63.767, including 2 seats in the voivodeship sejmiks (out of 855), 48 provincial (powiat) seats (out of 10.290), and 206 municipal (gmina) seats (out of 52.622). This amounted to 0.4% of all available seats. Despite winning a greater share of the popular vote, the Polish Family Association won even less seats because of the very high regionalization of its vote - it won 151 seats in total, or 0.2% of all available seats. In contrast, in the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, the parties that founded the Homeland Patriotic Movement won 7% of the popular vote in total. The failure of both the Homeland Patriotic Movement and Polish Family Association was attributed to the Solidarity Electoral Action, which co-opted key proposals of both committees and united the right-wing vote. The Solidarity Electoral Action ultimately got 20 times more seats than its right-wing rivals. It was found the Homeland Patriotic Movement performed the best in places where it entered tactical anti-postcommunist coalition with the Solidarity Electoral Action.\nThe coalition was dissolved shortly after the election, given the underwhelming performance. It disintegrated in November as its members would leave the party. The main party behind the Homeland Patriotic Movement, the Bloc for Poland, signed an agreement with the left-wing agrarian Polish People's Party to run on the party's electoral lists in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election. Only the leader of the Bloc for Poland won a seat, and soon after the 2001 election, Bloc for Poland abandoned political activity and was dissolved. Other members of the coalition, despite their diverse ideologies, became natural allies and continued their cooperation, first by forming the \"People's National Bloc\" (Polish: Blok Ludowo-Narodowy) with the far-left Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, and then founding the Alternative Social Movement for the 2001 election. The Alternative Social Movement combined Catholic nationalism with left-wing nationalism, with the latter ultimately prevailing.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Homeland Patriotic Movement was described as a \"radically right-wing\" coalition. It presented itself as the anti-establishment \"true right\" in contrast to the Solidarity Electoral Action. It promoted a radical decommunisation program, including the proposal of 'lustration' that thoroughly investigate former communist servants and informants, and ban them from holding a public office. The coalition also spoke for a regulated, 'pro-family' economy that would focus on small-sized domestic enterprises, while heavily restricting big corporations and halt privatization and deregulation reforms. Instead of free market, the coalition spoke for an economy that would be based on the Catholic principles of justice as well as subsidiarity, promoting social market economy that would replace the hitherto neoliberal course that Poland had taken. The rhetoric of the Homeland Patriotic Movement was also described as sovereignist and National-Catholic.\nIn their posters, the RPO declared: \"Our program is short, away with thieves and spies in our public life!\" The coalition presented itself as a united front of 'national-patriotic forces' that would stand against the domination of post-communist parties in Polish politics, in which it included the centre-right Solidarity Electoral Action because of their perceived tendency to cooperate with post-communist groupings. It attacked Lech Wałęsa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Adam Michnik as \"blurrers\" of the division into anti-communist and post-communist Polish forces, denouncing them as \"post-communists who elected themselves as conservative opposition\". The Homeland Patriotic Movement compared itself to the interwar Sanacja movement and promoted the cult of personality of Józef Piłsudski.\nThe party presented a reformist program in regards to the constitutional issues, decrying the Polish electoral law as unfair and unclear, and postulated the need of introducing a system that would be more transparent. It argued that local and regional governments are underfunded and are powerless to manage local issues. The coalition believed that the central government in Warsaw is bloated and should not only redistribute the funds to local governments, but also devolve more powers to them. The RPO also argued against proportional representation, comparing it to the interwar \"Sejmocracy\", which was the name for a period in the Second Polish Republic before the May Coup, characterized by political instability. In its place, the coalition proposed single-member constituencies.\nThe coalition presented itself as the choice of 'patriotic and honest voters', presenting itself as a movement that is above 'political bargains' and corruption. It stated that it will seek to implement policies that were either neglected or abandoned by the Solidarity Electoral Action, such as the implementation of a \"pro-family economy\", general enfranchisement, stricter penal code, and restructurization of mining and metallurgy industries \"in in the interests of Poland rather than the European Union\"; the coalition sought to nationalize heavy industries in Poland, decrying their privatization as surrender to foreign capital. It pledged to strive for an economy based on 'social good' based on social welfare and social market economy; it argued that this can only be achieved by harmonizing the relations between local and national governments, especially on issues such as nationalization and welfare programs. It also argued that the state has a duty to rescue unprofitable workplaces such as the Gdańsk Shipyard, arguing that privatizating such industries betrays Polish interests and makes local workers lose their jobs; the alternative proposed by the party was nationalization and subsidies. Lastly, the Homeland Patriotic Movement stated that it would pursue economic policies to guarantee basic needs of citizens, accusing the current government of pursuing \"glamorous or spectacular projects, which in addition involve enormous costs\".\nApart from promoting social welfare and nationalization, the coalition also stood out economically by decrying wealth inequality and the corruption of private enterprises, differentiating itself from other right-wing formations. It argued that it is unacceptable for business owners to earn 10 times more than most of their workers, and argued that most of the local governments work on the same unfair basis, where mayors have high salaries while minor public officials have very low income. The Homeland Patriotic Movement proposed anti-trust and transparency laws that would investigate the real costs of services that private businesses perform for local governments, arguing that high costs of water, waste disposal and public transport might be result of greed and lack of accountability. The coalition stated that in many ways, the dysfunction and corruption associated with the Polish People's Party and its public-owned workplaces can no longer be found in state-run industries, but rather in the privatized ones, especially those that had been acquired by the foreign capital.\nFocusing on the Solidarity Electoral Action as its main opponent, the Homeland Patriotic Movement represented a strand of Catholic, traditional-conservative and anti-EU politicians and voters that were opposed to the moderate course of the centre-right government. The coalition deeply opposed the proposals of \"speedy accession\" to the NATO and EU, and instead opposed the membership of Poland in both of these structures. The European Union was portrayed as a threat to the identity, economy and sovereignty of Poland. The EU was described as an organization that builds \"unity on money and killing identities\"; the RPO argued that the EU pursues a centralizing, uniform neoliberal economic policy that aims at \"levelling all that does not fit a common pattern\". The coalition presented itself as the only formation that would \"support Polish agriculture and Polish production in the face of the threat posed by accession to the EU, and protect Polish property against foreign hands\".\nThe media also noted that the Homeland Patriotic Movement had a staunchly populist and anti-establishment rhetoric. It ran a heavily mixed campaign, on one hand including colorful advertisements featuring sketches, while also using 'solemn' advertisement that promoted heavily religious, Catholic nationalist rhetoric. The coalition presented itself as the 'true right' that 'has no money', which it presented as a proof of its honesty and incorruptibility, as opposed to the centre-right Solidarity Electoral Action, which the RPO attacked as heavily corrupt and aristocratic. Its rhetoric also included accusations of conspiracies, bargains of the centre-right government with post-communist groupings, and allegations of electoral fraud. At the same time, it promoted light-hearted proposals, such as pledging to draft a new Broadcasting Act that would make football broadcasts guaranteed by law on state television.\nThe populist rhetoric of the Homeland Patriotic Movememnt was contrasted with that of the left-wing populist Social Alliance, who promoted anti-capitalist and anti-austerity slogans, and warned of \"annihilation of agriculture, the bankruptcy of national industry, the massive buyout of Polish land and widespread misery\". The RPO ran a somewhat similar campaign but one that was staunchly right-wing rather than radically left-wing, and as such focused on social issues, as well as Catholic and nationalist slogans. Media concluded that the 1998 elections showed a large group of voters who are \"dissatisfied, frustrated, losing out on the changes, basically indifferent to religion or even anti-clerical\"; this group of voters was to deliver the Social Alliance victory, thanks to its anti-capitalist and socioeconomic slogans. The news magazine Polityka argued that this group of voters is embodied by Andrzej Lepper and his Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland. Given the populist, anti-establishment and reformist characters of both coalition, the media observed that \"the program of the right-wing Patriotic Fatherland Movement can be harmonised with the declaration of the left-wing Social Alliance without much effort.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It follows the central ridge of the Augusta Mountains and covers approximately 14,050 acres of land. The lower portions are covered in sagebrush and rabbitbrush, while stands of pinyon-juniper, cottonwood, and willow thrive in the rugged canyons of the mountain slopes.  The land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management Winnemucca Field Office.\nIn 1980, the Bureau of Land Management established the 89,372-acre Augusta Mountain Wilderness Study Area to protect land within the Augusta Mountains. With some local advocacy from the Friends of Nevada Wilderness, some of the land was allocated as wilderness as part of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n\n== References ==",
